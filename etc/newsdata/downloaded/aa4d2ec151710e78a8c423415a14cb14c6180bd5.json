But there\u2019s also a respect for tradition, with room for creative riffs. And Tamaki had a great teacher in Susumu Kakinuma, the pizzaiolo at Seirinkan (yet another brilliant Tokyo pizzeria, also cited by Chang).\n\nRyan credits the Japanese concept of artisanship (shokunin) for the exceptional dough and toppings. \u201cThese chefs have been perfecting their pizzas for years, through small, incremental changes in a never-ending pursuit of perfection.\u201d\n\nPerfection in action: dough is masterfully prepared in the kitchen of Pizza Studio Tamaki. Luke Burgess\n\nThe quality is so high that on Ugly Delicious, Antonio Pace, president of the True Neapolitan Pizza Association, applauds his Japanese cohort, while adding: \u201cPlease stop improving. Because, if you make pizza better than we do, I\u2019d get really angry.\u201d\n\nToo late, says Giovanni Paradiso, co-restaurateur behind Fratelli Paradiso in Sydney and Tokyo. \u201cThe best pizza is in Tokyo.\u201d (Which echoes Beddia\u2019s experience: \u201cIt\u2019s way better than anything I had in Naples.\u201d)\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love the pizza in Italy, too,\u201d says Paradiso, but the pursuit of perfection in Japan (from flour experimentation to evolving techniques) upends anything he\u2019s tasted in Italy. And the scene is so competitive that Savoy \u2013 the pizzeria many name as the city\u2019s best \u2013 only ranks as \u201ca big No. 4\u201d for Paradiso. (His pick is Guerrero in Setagaya City, where \u201cI had one of the best artichoke dishes I\u2019d ever had in my life\u201d.)\n\nIt's this artisanship that makes the difference, says Fratelli Paradiso's Giovanni Paradiso. Luke Burgess\n\nAt Fratelli Paradiso\u2019s Omotesand\u014d restaurant, there are many favourite dishes from the Sydney original (pretzel with bottarga, scampi spaghetti), but there\u2019s a Japanese touch, too. Some in-house pasta is produced with a udon-making machine.\n\nThis mixing of culinary styles is also evident in Tokyo\u2019s pastry scene \u2013 at Vaner, for example, a charming bakery opened in Yanaka a year ago by Tsukasa Miyawaki. Walk into the timber building and you\u2019ll be hit by cardamom and cinnamon scents: a tribute to his spell in an Oslo bakery. His Norwegian pastries use ancient wheats he discovered overseas, like the \u00f8land flour he sifts into fragrant rolls and crisp croissants,\n\n\u201cI tune down the amount of sugar and butter, to maximise the flavour of the amazing wheat,\u201d he says. It\u2019s one reason his pastries are worth seeking out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShinobu Namae, the award-winning chef behind L\u2019Effervescence, also took inspiration from wheat fields and international bakeries when opening Bricolage Bread and Co in Roppongi. Eating in Lima, Bali, Melbourne and San Francisco shaped the menu, while loaves and pastries are baked from Hokkaido wheat, mochi-mugi (a type of barley) sourced via his soy-sauce brewer and yumechikara, a wheat variety that took 12 years to develop (due to Japanese rainfall levels).\n\nPerfection is the name of the game at Bricolage Bread and Co, too \u2013 helmed by Shinobu Namae.\n\nWhile Bricolage Bread and Co is more casual than his two-Michelin-starred restaurant, Namae approaches it with equal integrity: ingredients are sourced from L\u2019Effervescence\u2019s farmers. Japan\u2019s switch from a rice-based diet to greater wheat consumption came from post-war, US aid shipments of grain, but Namae uses his bakery/cafe to focus on local ingredients instead: Daichidou spelt, specialty coffee from Okinawa, kombu from Rebun. Leftover bread becomes beer, with help from a brewery in the village of Nozawa-onsen in Nagano prefecture.\n\n\u201cOne of the best croissants and galette des rois I have ever eaten was bought and made in Tokyo,\u201d says Remi Talbot, the French chef behind Messina Creative Department in Sydney\u2019s Darlinghurst. He used to work at Den, one of Tokyo\u2019s best restaurants. Talbot recently returned for guest chef events, where he made wasabi sherbet and shio koji mousse topped with burnt yuzu sorbet.\n\nBruschetta, Bricolage style.\n\nDespite his French background, he has no problem praising the croissants and galette des rois at Boulangerie Sudo in Setagaya, run by a chef named Hideo Sudo.\n\nTalbot says Japan is \u201cextremely attracted and influenced by foreigner food cultures\u201d, which is why even Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe has trouble getting a reservation to eat at En Boca, yet another Tokyo restaurant, in Shibuya, renowned for its pizza.\n\nHere, the appetite for good dough is limitless.", "description": "How did Japan become the home of \u201cthe best pizza in the world\u201d?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3657%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_104%2C$y_834/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/177a4e5f4528c52775d3e0a665b654f678a1f2be", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
