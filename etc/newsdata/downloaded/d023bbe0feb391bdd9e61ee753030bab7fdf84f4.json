There\u2019s no inquiry or inquest. No one\u2019s looking for that person.\n\n\u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is for people to look into things and find out why that was allowed to happen.\u201d\n\nSlamming the government, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think they realise the impact. It\u2019s not just the people in the shops, it\u2019s not just the people on the airline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s having an effect now on baggage handlers, cleaners, caterers - all of these people are now finding themselves going to be unemployed.\u201d", "description": "Therese Coffey said she welcomes 'the support that's given to help people in this difficult time' as she spoke out on the collapse in the Commons", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Surrey Live", "Darren Pepe", "Pa", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18329937.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DPP_SAH_sm190620_016JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
