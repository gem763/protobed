This is the rock that was melted by the heat and pressure of the impact. It lapped across the base of the crater in the subsequent seconds and minutes.\n\nThis then transitions to a lot of fragmented melt rock - the result of explosions as water rushed over the hot material.\n\nThe water came from the shallow sea covering the area at the time. It would have been pushed temporarily out of the way by the impact but when it came back in and made contact with the broiling rock, it would have set off violent reactions. Something similar occurs at volcanoes where magma interacts with seawater.\n\nThis phase covers the first minutes to an hour. But the water keeps coming, filling up the crater, and the top 80-90m of the core section is built from all the debris that was in this water and ultimately rained out. Larger fragments initially followed by finer and finer material.\n\nThe timescale for this is the first hours after the impact.\n\nAnd then, right at the top of the 130m core section is evidence of a tsunami. The sediments all dip in one direction and their organisation suggests they were deposited in a high-energy event.\n\nImage copyright BARCROFT PRODUCTIONS/BBC Image caption Artwork: The impact would have generated enormous tsunami waves\n\nScientists say the impact would have generated a giant wave pulse that would have crashed on to shorelines hundreds of kilometres from the crater. But this outward train would also have had a return pulse and it's the debris carried in this tsunami that caps the top of the rock sequence.\n\n\"This is all still Day One,\" says Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin. \"Tsunamis move at the speed of a jet plane. Twenty-four hours is a generous amount of time for the waves to move out and come back in again,\" he told BBC News.\n\nProf Gulick's team is confident in the tsunami interpretation because mixed in with the deposits are soil markers, and charcoal - evidence of the great fires that would have been triggered on nearby landmasses by the heat of the impact - all brought back to the crater by the returning wave pulse.\n\nStrikingly, what the team doesn't see anywhere in the 130m core is the presence of sulphur. That's surprising because the asteroid would have hit a seafloor made up by perhaps a third to half with sulphur-containing minerals, such as gypsum.\n\nFor some reason, the sulphur must have been preferentially ejected or vaporised. But this only goes to support the popular theory now for how the dinosaurs met their demise.\n\nImage copyright Tim Peake/Nasa/ESA Image caption Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula viewed from the International Space Station\n\nSo much sulphur mixed with water and injected into the sky would have dramatically cooled the climate, making life a struggle for all sorts of plant and animal life.\n\n\"There was a global climate model run with just a hundred gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of sulphur injected into the atmosphere and that came up with 25C cooling for at least 15 years, which puts most of the planet below freezing,\" said Prof Gulick.\n\n\"And the conservative estimate for the amount of sulphur released is 325 gigatonnes. That's orders of magnitude more than you would get from any volcano like a Krakatau which can also cool the climate for a short period.\"\n\nThe mammals pulled through this calamity, the dinosaurs did not.\n\nProf Gulick and team's research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "description": "Scientists reconstruct the seconds, minutes and hours following the dino-killing asteroid impact.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E1A9/production/_89796775__cx19603.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
