I\u2019m working hard in training, I want to be there, I hope everyone can see that, so with moments like this I hope I can make a case for myself.\n\n\u201cOf course (it was difficult to be left out at Lille). You want to play, be on the field and be in the team as much as you can and it hurt not to be there but I\u2019m happy I got my opportunity at Southampton .\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cCulture-wise, it\u2019s been easier to settle than it was in Germany to be honest. From the football side, I guess you could say that. Obviously, I haven\u2019t been getting as many minutes as I would like. I will just keep going, keep pushing. I know my time\u2019s going to come.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just going to throw a fit and give up ever, so if I\u2019m on the bench it doesn\u2019t mean the gaffer doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a part of the team, I\u2019ve just got to keep pushing and earn my spot.\u201d\n\nPulisic has provided four assists this season and laid on another at Southampton when he came on as a late substitute.\n\n(Image: Chelsea FC via Getty Images)\n\nBut Pulisic admits the criticism has hurt, although he insists the level of expectation which comes with his \u00a358m price tag has not weighed him down.\n\nPulisic added: \u201cYou can\u2019t completely ignore it. I don\u2019t live under a rock. I hear things, I see things, but I do my best to block it out. I\u2019m just working hard for myself.\n\n\u201cThe outside opinions don\u2019t matter as much to me as to what\u2019s in the team and myself and the people who care about me. So I\u2019m just going to keep working and do my best and not worry about it.\n\n\u201cThis number (\u00a358m) doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. Obviously, I go out and try to give my best every time I\u2019m on the pitch.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I\u2019m not sure what the price tag means to you, but I just have to keep trying to perform at my best for myself and for the team.\n\n\u201cI did the best I could with the minutes I got. I tried to help the team as best I could. I guess I\u2019m happy but I going to keep working harder, and I\u2019m never going to stop to try to get more minutes.\n\n\u201cThe level of competition has been great. Competition in the team can only make me better and I think that\u2019s what makes teams, it\u2019s guys who are maybe not the second or third man, but they are pushing each other in training every single day. That\u2019s what a good team is all about.\u201d", "description": "The American moved to Stamford Bridge for \u00a358 million in the summer but has struggled to cement his place", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Reuters", "Chelsea Fc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528946.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Southampton-v-Chelsea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
