It's the best word to describe not just this latest generation of the Porsche 911 but all six inceptions that came before it since the 1963 original.\n\nThe evergreen silhouette; a flat six engine; the motor straddled by the two rear wheels: you'd be forgiven for asking if there's anything new about this iteration - the 992 - at all.\n\nBut don't let the oh-so-familiar formula deceive you.\n\nUnder that instantly-recognisable bodywork is a tour-de-force of new tech that, on paper - especially according to the marketing fluff - should make this the best 911 to drive yet.\n\nWe headed to Valencia, in Spain, to take the new 992 - available in the UK from March - for a spin to see if it lives up to that marketing spiel.\n\nIs it new? This is the latest generation of the Porsche 911, the 992 model that arrives in the UK in March\n\nBeauty has always been in the eye of the 911's beholder\n\nThe perception of 911 ownership today is, diplomatically put, divisive.\n\nOn one hand, the flagship Porsche is seen as the unimaginative choice. The obvious option. A selection made by those who only want the badge kudos to keep up with the Joneses. Almost a passionless purchase.\n\nOn the other hand is a great appreciation for the excellence of the modern-era 911.\n\nI'll hold my mitts up to being in this latter group.\n\nTake the previous model. The (confusingly named) 991 in Turbo form, in my opinion, is one of the greatest 'daily drives' for a fee that leaves you with a little spare change from \u00a3130,000).\n\nName a better car you can use to comfortably collect your kids from pre-school after a knuckle-whitening track day?\n\nBut even I struggle to defend Porsche's effortless attempts to make a next-generation 911 look\u2026 well, next generation.\n\nWhat you end up doing is appreciating the subtleties the steadfast design team in Stuttgart has begrudgingly allowed to slip through the net.\n\nMailOnline deputy motoring editor Rob Hull travelled to Spain to test the latest 911 in Valencia earlier in the month\n\nThe 992 model is the eighth generation of Porsche's iconic sports car. But is it the best?\n\nAt a quickfire test in sunny Valencia this month, a fortunate few of us were presented with keys to the eighth-generation Carrera S and Carrera 4S models \u2013 the first two variants of the 992 available from launch in the UK from March.\n\nNot that it's easy to tell it is new.\n\nIf, from a far, you can identify it from the old one then you can have a whole-hearted pat on the back from me.\n\nCreep closer and it becomes fractionally less painstaking to decipher the 992 from the 991 (are you keeping up with the baffling numbering system?).\n\nA wider rear track is no longer reserved for Turbo S models and above like before.\n\nThat means even the hardest-pressed 911 customer buying an option-rationed Carrera will still get to enjoy the sight of bulging rear arches in the wing mirrors.\n\nThe headlights are new, too. The familiar oval rims now frame an LED cluster in a square arrangement \u2013 this is the tell-tale cue to spot a 992 driving towards you.\n\nCan you tell the 991 version from the latest 992? We'll give you a hint - the headlights are the giveaway\n\nThe single strip brake light spanning the full curvature of the rear panel has a soothing - almost warming - glow in the flesh\n\nFortunately, more pencil lead has been used to redesign the rear.\n\nThe single-strip brake light beam, which spans the full curvature of the back panel, is far more impressive in the metal than in pictures and has an almost soothing and warming glow as the LEDS flicker on the camera lens.\n\nEven the twin exhaust outlets give the 911 an improved impression of hunkeredness.\n\nThe \u2013 on first impressions clunky - active rear spoiler is also much better in the flesh.\n\nIn photos of the 992 it looked like the panel on the rear deck had flapped free in what could only be described as a very un-German-like lack of build quality.\n\nIn person, it's a more clinical piece of mechanical engineering and bolsters the more aggressive looks.\n\nAnd that's about it.\n\nCould Porsche have pushed the design boundaries a smidgen and still retained the 911 identity? Absolutely yes.\n\nThe front track (the distance between the two front wheels) is 45mm wider than before, which translates to better grip\n\nThe 911 remains one of the prettiest cars in the segment. But could Porsche have done more? We think so\n\nAn evolved interior\n\nThat's one of the complexities of this legendary marque; the ever-present undertone that Porsche doesn't want to mess too much with a winning formula when it comes to the 911.\n\nAnd why should it go out on a limb with the cherry on its cake \u2013 or the apple in its eye \u2013 when it's been a raging success for the best part of 55 years?\n\nHowever, those responsible for the 992 have taken more significant steps to make sure the interior has moved with the times \u2013 though somehow remained almost completely the same.\n\nThe cabin architecture has been uncluttered like a housemaid has been at it on a spring-time mission.\n\nPorsche has managed to keep the cabin familiar while upgrading it entirely, especially when it comes to technology\n\nEven the ignition switch has a robust, chunky feel that's been incorporated into all the switchgear of the 992-gen 911\n\nGone are the mass of crude controls surrounding the gear shift that looked like a small explosion had gone off in a plastic-button factory.\n\nInstead, these have been moved into the lower section of the dashboard in a swathe of toggle switches with a beveled metallic finish that make the interior feel infinitely more premium.\n\nThe stocky PDK-automatic shifter \u2013 the manual transmission won't be available until later in the year \u2013 has also been given the same treatment and feels of equal quality.\n\nHigher in the cockpit is a wide touchscreen display with a new sat-nav system that's on par with the high-definition units you'd find in Germany's most up-to-date executive limos.\n\nThe driver's instruments are now entirely digital, though Rob found it difficult to position the wheel so he could see all five without obstruction\n\nGone is the mass of plastic buttons around the gear shifter. In their place are metal toggle switches\n\nFinally, a quad of digital driver's instruments complete the refurb of the cabin.\n\nThese are as hi-tech as we've seen on the market yet, offering a range of functionality that gives you the option of anything from thermal imagining to be presented alongside a traditional tachometer.\n\nThe only downfall is, despite my efforts to manipulate the driving position to overcome it, sections of the flanking screens are hidden behind the leather-wrapped wheel. And there's no head-up display to offer an unmolested view of the instructions.\n\nFortunately, the driving position is exceptional. Somehow, Porsche has managed to make slimmer and lighter chairs \u2013 still ratcheted into the perfect spot in the chassis - that bit more cossetting.\n\nFaster than a 911 has ever felt\n\nPorsche 911 (992) spec Model: Porsche 911 Carrera S Price new: from \u00a393,110 On sale: from March 2019 Engine: 2981cc, flat-six cylinders, turbocharged Transmission: Eight-speed twin-clutch auto Drive: Rear wheel drive, limited-slip diff Power: 444bhp at 6500rpm Torque: 391lb ft at 2300rpm 0-62mph: 3.5sec (with Sport Chrono pack) Top speed: 191mph Fuel economy: 31.7mpg CO2 emissions: 205g/km Weight: 1515kg Dimensions; Length: 4519mm Width: 1852mm Height: 1,300mm\n\nYou won't be surprised to hear it's quick.\n\nHowever, this is a new level of quick by the 911's standards.\n\nPummel the throttle pedal into the carpet and the turbo whips-up 391lb ft of torque and 444bhp of power from the 3.0-litre flat six motor without a hint of hesitation.\n\nThe needle rises to 62mph from a standstill in just 3.5 seconds in the Carrera S; a tenth quicker in the 4S with power sent to all four of the 21-inch wheels.\n\nAnd it's how it pulls its own weight is what boggles the mind.\n\nEven the most alert driver will be convinced there's no turbo bolted at the back, as it accelerates with the linear delivery of a naturally-aspirated powerplant, and it's just as smooth as one at low revs when idling through town.\n\nIt helps that the revised eight-speed auto box is as sharp as a haystack full of needles, shifts seamlessly and massages your driving ego by selecting the ideal gear at all times to save your average-driver blushes.\n\nThe powertrain is so refined that it somehow manages to make motorway journeys feel almost painless \u2013 no mean feat for a near-\u00a3100,000 sports car.\n\nA compliant ride \u2013 even on the enormous alloy rims, thanks to new adaptive dampers \u2013 and barely a rustle of wind buffeting or tyre roar means the longest slogs can be completed without a strain on your vertebrae or vocal chords.\n\nIt has all the qualities of a GT car.\n\nThe part all you 911 buyers (and dreamers) have been waiting for\u2026\n\nThrowing together a car so it will go fast in a straight line isn't difficult \u2013 ask just about every American auto brand. But crafting one to corner with finesse takes a whole lot more expertise.\n\nThis is what Porsche has managed to achieve with the 911 without a blip for over half a century.\n\nBut that means moving the goalposts can be a finite opportunity, especially when you consider the rear-engine layout should create a challenge against physics.\n\nBut, somehow, the German maker has managed to surpass itself again.\n\nThe biggest gain made on the replaced version is how the 992 gets into corners.\n\nBy making the front track (the distance between the two front wheels) 45mm wider than before the grip levels instantly feel enhanced.\n\nThe steering rack has been made quicker - from lock-to-lock the wheel needs just 2.5 rotations. It makes the 911 feel incredibly agile and nimble\n\nHow Porsche's flagship sportscar munches through corners is incredibly inspiring and feels effortless even at high speed\n\nEven with electronic power steering \u2013 which are mechanically and objectively void of feel \u2013 the 911 gives you the confidence that it has hooked up to a turn with incredible precision.\n\nPorsche's decision to make the steering rack quicker than before (it now turns from lock-to-lock in 2.5 rotations) gives the car an increased sense of agility.\n\nDespite being entirely synthetic, this quicker response inspires the conviction to corner faster and harder than before, especially with the improved traction from the two additionally driven wheels in the 4S.\n\nIt's still beautifully balanced, too, pivoting through turns with the grace of an Olympic figure skater.\n\nThe chassis is so finely tuned that any degree of adjustment to the steering angle, throttle or brake application failed to unsettle the car, as I primitively attempted to hustle it through the snaking mountain roads on the east coast of Spain.\n\nUnder the metal: Here's how the new 992 looks with and without bodywork. Notice how compact the rear of the car is, considering this is where the 3.0-litre petrol motor sits\n\nThe Cars & Motoring Verdict\n\nThe big question is: if you have the money has the 992 done enough to warrant walking through the glass doors of a Porsche dealership to slap down the \u00a393,000 asking price, instead of saving some dough by snapping up a 991 on the used market?\n\nWhile I won't try to convince you with aesthetics, the driving alone is a credible excuse to go face-to-face with a pristinely-dressed salesman.\n\nIs it perfect? I would argue it's as close to perfection as the market has achieved yet \u2013 and explains why so few brands bother to release a rival to one of the most well established four-wheeled entities.\n\nOn looks alone, it's hard to argue why someone should shell out the extra cash for the latest 911 instead of the previous-generation model\n\nHowever, from behind the wheel there's a plethora of excuses to take your cheque book to a Porsche dealership next month\n\nMaybe Porsche has missed a trick by not offering a manual gearbox at launch, though you shouldn't have to wait too long if this is an ice breaker.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, if you already appreciate 911s then you'll unquestionably appreciate the lengths taken to mechanically dial the 992 into a sub-\u00a3100,000 superlative.\n\nThe power delivery achieves a new level of savage acceleration but with smooth delivery; the cabin feels familiar though entirely upgraded; and the mechanical and scientific enhancements to overcome cornering physics is \u2013 yet again \u2013 unfathomable. All of this from a car with two rear seats and ample luggage space.\n\nAnd there's still the models like the GTS, GT3 and \u2013 deep intake of breath \u2013 GT2 possibly set to come.\n\nIt's hard to comprehend that the 911 is going to get even better.\n\nAs impressive as the performance is, you have to also remind yourself how practical the 911 still is. It has two seats in the back and plenty of luggage space under the bonnet", "description": "Evolutionary.
