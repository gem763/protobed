He was going to run it out, from all the way back in May, all the way into one of those free-agency binders Scott Boras passes around every December, all the way into his multi-generational wealth. All of which would happen anyway.\n\nCole was the sure thing, THE sure thing, not nothing when the guy behind him is Justin Verlander.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHis last loss was 26 starts ago. His Houston Astros had lost two of them, neither reflecting poorly on Cole, and otherwise they won, including three starts in October, once when he struck out 15 Tampa Bay Rays and once when he shut out the New York Yankees for seven innings in the Bronx.\n\nThe remarkable regular-season Cole had become an even better Cole, the give-me-a-run-or-two-and-we-win Cole, which is precisely what the Astros did for him in the first inning Tuesday night. Which wasn\u2019t enough. Not near enough. These things happen, just not lately, and not to Gerrit Cole.\n\nAnd so Alex Bregman stood late Tuesday night with his back against the wall, wearing a white T-shirt that looked straight out of the bottom of his gym bag and a pair of sweats in whose pockets he pushed his hands as far as they would go, clean up to his forearms. He looked tired, except maybe he always looks a little tired, his eyes wearing that drowsy thing that suckers pitchers into thinking he\u2019s not all there.\n\nHouston Astros starting pitcher Gerrit Cole allowed five runs in Game 1 of the World Series and lost for the first time since May. (AP/David J. Phillip)\n\nStory continues\n\nLong after his Houston Astros had taken the first game of the World Series on the chin at Minute Maid Park, by a score of 5-4, after Cole had given up all five of those runs, after Carlos Correa had struck out three times, after plenty of guys had left baserunners out there, after they\u2019d let the Washington Nationals\u2019 bullpen off the hook across three innings and 15 batters, Bregman had identified the enemy and it was he.\n\n\u201cIt starts with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was horrible all night.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been terrible this postseason. I need to get in the video room, get in the cage and figure it out. For me, personally, I\u2019ve just been horrible mechanically.\u201d\n\nThen he went through the outcomes that make a hitter feel feeble, among them taking hittable pitches for strikes, swinging at unhittable pitches. Maybe that\u2019s about it. That\u2019s about enough.\n\n\u201cBetter take my bat home,\u201d he said, cracking a wry smile, \u201csleep with it, figure it out.\u201d\n\nIn 12 games, he\u2019s had nine hits and 11 walks, which doesn\u2019t sound terrible, except he\u2019s found himself swinging through middle-middle fastballs, swinging under fastballs he\u2019s used to hammering, finding at times that it\u2019s all moving too fast. He\u2019s more accustomed to the game slowing to his speed, to getting up on the plate and forcing pitchers to come in while also covering the plate away, holding his elbows up high and taut the way he likes, what a guy does when he bangs 41 home runs and hits .296 across the first six months. Then the postseason gets choppy, the games spread out, the pitchers come and go, and one night you\u2019re going home with your Louisville Slugger.\n\n\u201cRight now, for me, I don\u2019t feel the adjustments I need to make,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything\u2019s quick. Normally I\u2019m a little slow in the box. \u2026 And I gotta figure it out, ASAP. I gotta be better.\u201d\n\nMany of the Astros wore that expression, not beaten but perhaps sensing Game 1 should have been theirs. Max Scherzer looked a lot like Cole across his five innings and 112 pitches, still capable and still ferocious, but oddly beatable. The Astros had their baserunners. They had their hitters\u2019 counts. They had their openings.\n\nAlex Bregman struck out three times in Game 1 of the World Series. (Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nBregman struck out three times, once with two runners on base, and again in the ninth inning, with Sean Doolittle pitching and the Crawford Boxes calling in a one-run game. He hadn\u2019t struck out three times in a game since May 2018. Across five plate appearances, he\u2019d put a single ball in play and that was a harmless grounder to shortstop. In the seventh inning, against Tanner Rainey, who throws hard and is a not unreasonable place to strike the Nationals\u2019 short bullpen, Bregman had a runner at first base and a three-and-oh count, took two fastballs for strikes, fouled off the fastball he might\u2019ve otherwise hit onto the train tracks, then walked.\n\n\u201cProbably the only productive thing I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said, \u201cthe past few weeks.\u201d\n\nThat inning died with Yordan Alvarez struck out with the bases loaded.\n\nBregman walked out empty-handed, so he probably had been joking about the bat, which is not to say he didn\u2019t find one to drag along the corridor to his car for the drive home. The Astros lost their last World Series opener \u2014 two years ago, albeit in Los Angeles and not here \u2014 and won that series in seven. Bregman hit .233 in that series. Come this sort of series, it\u2019s not so much how often but when, and there are plenty more whens out there, plenty more wagging orange hankies, plenty more woos for Reddick, plenty more boos for whomever is wearing the gray pants.\n\nBefore he\u2019d left, Bregman had said again that it starts with him, the cleanup hitter, the possible American League MVP, the slugger, the guy who doesn\u2019t want to be alone tonight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely failed enough in this game,\u201d he said, \u201cto know how to get back at it.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After striking out three times, Alex Bregman takes responsibility for Game 1 loss.", "authors": ["Tim Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IEh9PhTHrhCwRD0wmy92hQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mvT5TDMS3qn3R.s3IL1ZjQ--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2416e4e0-f55b-11e9-bcff-3e133610434f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
