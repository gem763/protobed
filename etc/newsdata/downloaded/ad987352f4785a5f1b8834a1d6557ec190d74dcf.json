Likewise, he declined Giorgio Chiellini\u2019s offer to take back the captain\u2019s armband that he had earned in his first 17 seasons with the club.\n\n\u201cTalking about a rivalry with Szczesny is inappropriate,\u201d Buffon said after Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cThe situation has been clear from the start and I\u2019ve accepted it. I\u2019m adjusting to this new, reduced role. But there are opportunities I can take advantage of.\u201d\n\nIt was Buffon\u2019s 902nd club match as a professional, equaling Paolo Maldini\u2019s record for an Italian player. With seven more appearances, Buffon can break Maldini\u2019s mark for most games played in Serie A.\n\nAgainst Verona, Buffon even had luck on his side with Verona hitting the woodwork three times.\n\nA first-half penalty from Samuel Di Carmine hit the post with Buffon having lunged in the opposite direction, then Darko Lazovic\u2019s attempt at the rebound banged off the crossbar. Later, Buffon stopped a dangerous effort from Lazovic on a counterattack and Miguel Veloso\u2019s attempt at the rebound skimmed off the crossbar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I wanted to share in more emotions with the management and Juve\u2019s fans,\u201d said Buffon, who is expected to retire after this season and join the club\u2019s management. \u201cReturning was a huge satisfaction at my age after a great career.\u201d\n\nThe match also marked the first time Buffon played with fellow great Cristiano Ronaldo, who converted a penalty for Juve\u2019s second goal.\n\nBALOTELLI RETURNS\n\nAfter serving a four-match ban from last season in the French league, Mario Balotelli can finally make his debut with Brescia - his hometown club - against Juventus on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked harder in the last month and a half than I have in a decade,\u201d Balotelli said in an interview with DAZN. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t have match fitness, as I only played two friendlies, but I\u2019m in great shape. The last time I was at this weight I was at Manchester City.\u201d\n\nBalotelli added that his goal is to rejoin Italy\u2019s team for next year\u2019s European Championship.\n\nHe could face Ronaldo in his first match back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to face the best, but I will try to score and play like in any other game,\u201d Balotelli said. \u201cHis presence doesn\u2019t really interest me.\u201d\n\nSERIE A WOMEN\n\nAC Milan and Juventus are the only clubs with perfect records two rounds into the women\u2019s season.\n\nMilan beat Orobica Bergamo 4-1 with captain Valentina Giacinti scoring her second of the season - leaving her on course to match her league-best 21 goals in 21 matches last season.\n\nCristiana Girelli scored twice as Juventus came from a goal down to beat Sassuolo 3-1, giving her three goals in two matches.\n\nRoma won 2-0 at Fiorentina with goals from 21-year-old Annamaria Serturini and Norway international Andrine Hegerberg. Serturini was the youngest member of Italy\u2019s squad that reached the quarterfinals of the Women\u2019s World Cup this year.\n\nAfter an international break, the season resumes Oct. 12-13 with the Milan derby.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It was exactly the type of performance that Gianluigi Buffon had in mind when he decided to return to Juventus in the unaccustomed role of a reserve.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dampf"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/italy_soccer_serie_a_72317_c0-60-2598-1574_s1770x1032.jpg?e68574befd655250b0d1682d1f83fb0d53b3a269", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
