However, it is the energy costs, and not emissions considerations, that are threatening hydro-powered NZAS.\n\n\u201cUnder current market conditions and with high energy costs, we expect the short to medium outlook for the aluminium industry to be challenging and this asset (NZAS) to continue to be unprofitable,\u201d Rio said.\n\n\u201cRio Tinto intends to hold discussions with the government of New Zealand and energy providers to explore options and identify economically viable solutions to find a pathway to profitability for the asset.\u201d\n\nAustralians should have a cheap, reliable, globally competitive source of energy. Today it\u2019s not the case. \u2014 Jean-Sebastien Jacques, Rio Tinto chief executive\n\nRio is in similar talks with the federal and state governments, and energy providers, in Australia about its Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania, the Boyne smelters in Queensland and the Tomago smelter, near Newcastle, which have a combined total of about 2650 employees.\n\nRio has also been in talks with hydro-power provider Meridian Energy about driving down costs.\n\nMeridian chief executive Neal Barclay said NZAS had been offered changes and concessions on its existing supply contract and Meridian was willing to continue negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"NZAS has advised Meridian that the changes we had offered to date on our contract fall short of the pricing for delivered energy that NZAS needs to re-establish its position as an internationally competitive aluminium smelter,\" he said.\n\nMeridian said NZAS costs associated with the work needed to keep one of the smelter potlines operating were also a factor in Rio's viability review.\n\nUnder the supply contract with Meridian, NZAS can terminate or reduce electricity consumption from 572 megawatts to 400 megawatts with a year's notice.\n\nRio Tinto Aluminium chief executive Alf Barrios said the aluminium industry faced significant headwinds, with prices at historic lows because of oversupply in the market.\n\nStrategic review\n\nThe NZAS strategic review will consider all options, including shutdowns and closure. It is due to be completed in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nThe smelter, a joint venture between Rio Tinto (79.36 per cent) and Sumitomo Chemical Company Limited, employs about 1000 people.\n\nPacific Aluminium\u2019s mounting losses over the past year are a big concern for Rio. The business suffered a net loss of $US151 million in the 12 months to June 30 and an EBITDA loss of $US57 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking after the release of Rio\u2019s first-half results in August, Mr Jacques said high energy prices and falling demand caused by reduced buying from the automotive industry had created \u201ca very, very challenging situation\u201d.\n\n\"Australians should have a cheap, reliable, globally competitive source of energy. Today it\u2019s not the case,\" he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s an issue for us because, as you know, we have three smelters and two refineries in Australia and today the situation is not good.\n\n\"We\u2019re in discussion with the federal government and the state governments and our utility providers, depending on which smelter we\u2019re talking about, in order to see ways to ensure the long-term viability of those assets.\"\n\nGrid upgrades\n\nTransmission costs have been on the rise in New Zealand, where much of the renewables generation is based on the less populated South Island.\n\nSouth Island-based NZAS faces a $64 million transmission bill in 2019 and is estimated to have paid nearly $NZ200 million ($187 million) to fund grid upgrades in the upper North Island over the past decade.\n\nAAC's Ms Johnson said the main issue facing smelters in Australia and New Zealand was the delivered cost of energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What NZAS shows is evidence that even with the lower carbon footprint associated with that electricity, it is still the delivered cost that is the most important thing in terms of making commercial decisions,\" she said.\n\nShe said the role played by large energy users in providing grid stability was undervalued and warned that it would be a huge blow to jobs and value-addition in Australia if smelters were crippled by high energy prices.\n\n\"Given that Australia has got a wealth of energy resources, both thermal and renewable, it should be using those energy resources to value-add to commodities,\"Ms Johnson said.\n\n\"Alumina and aluminium have historically been one of the success stories around that.\"", "description": "The mining group has flagged the possible closure of its New Zealand aluminium operations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3057%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_305/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1aaf038da93229ba6c977a8f8245128dcf9988f3", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
