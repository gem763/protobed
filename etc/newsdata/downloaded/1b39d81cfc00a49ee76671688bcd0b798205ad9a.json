To remain compliant with this order, Adobe is deactivating all accounts in Venezuela.\"\n\nIt said it had no idea how long the sanctions would be in effect but added: \"We will continue to monitor developments closely and will make every effort to restore services to Venezuela as soon as it is legally permissible to do so.\"\n\nIt said it \"was unable to issue refunds\" because the sanctions included \"sales, service, support, refunds, credits, etc\".\n\nAdobe has moved to a subscription-only model for the latest versions of its products meaning users will not be able to buy standalone versions.\n\nOne human rights advocate in the region, Geoff Ramsey, tweeted: \"Incredibly counterproductive. Any civil society NGO [non-governmental organisation] or independent media outlet that relies on registered copies of Photoshop, InDesign or Acrobat will be impacted.\"\n\nThe sanctions announced by President Trump freeze all Venezuelan government assets in the US and bar transactions with it. They are similar to sanctions imposed on North Korea, Iran and Cuba.\n\nThe US is one of more than 50 nations that do not recognise Mr Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate president.\n\nBut there has been criticism of the US sanctions.\n\nUN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, said the sanctions were extremely broad and would hit the most vulnerable sections of society.", "description": "Users in the country have until the end of the month to save any work they have in their Adobe accounts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0C70/production/_109148130_adobelogo.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
