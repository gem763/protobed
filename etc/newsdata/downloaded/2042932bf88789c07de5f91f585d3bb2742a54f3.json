(Charlie Riedel/AP)\n\nComing this Friday night: the spookiest full moon in 13 years.\n\nThis Friday the 13th full moon is the first since January 2006.\n\nBut this full moon, most commonly known as the harvest moon, will appear much smaller than most. That\u2019s because the moon will be at apogee, or the farthest point in its roughly four-week orbit. Timeanddate.com estimates a \u201cmicromoon\u201d appears 14 percent smaller and 30 percent dimmer than the widely reported \u201csupermoons\u201d that dominate the news.\n\nThough there is no universal definition governing what qualifies as a supermoon or micromoon, Time and Date says micromoons must be more than 251,655 miles away from Earth. Friday night\u2019s moon will be 816 miles farther than that.\n\nSupermoons, on the other hand, must be at least 2,039 miles closer to Earth than a micromoon. Most of the time, the moon sits somewhere in between those bounds.\n\nThe moon rises over Washington at 7:31 p.m. Friday. Just look to the east about five minutes after sunset, and you\u2019ll see the orange disk poking above the horizon. Until it\u2019s firmly planted high in the sky, however, it\u2019ll be tough to appreciate just how small it looks.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fun Friday night activity, considering inviting your friends and/or resident canine to howl with you at the lunar disk.\n\n\n\nA supermoon glows above the Southwest Waterfront in Washington on Dec. 1, 2017. (Benjamin C. Tankersley/The Washington Post) (Benjamin C Tankersley/For The Washington Post)\n\nSome call the harvest moon the \u201ccorn moon,\u201d since September marks a time during which farmers in the Plains typically begin harvesting their corn. Farther north, some may wait a bit later.\n\nThis Friday the 13th full moon won\u2019t technically reach peak illumination until 12:32 a.m. Eastern time on Saturday, but for all practical purposes is considered full Friday night. This was also the case in January 2006, when the moon rose the night of the 13th but became full on 4:48 a.m. on Saturday, the 14th.\n\nThe next time we\u2019ll have a moon approaching fullness on Friday the 13th (before achieving total illumination the next morning) will be in a little over 13 years. in May 2033.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for something really riveting, mark your calendar for 2037. There will be two blue moons in a span of three months \u2014 a blue moon defined as the second full moon in a calendar month. They\u2019ll occur on Jan. 31 and March 31, both months that will also feature a full moon on the first of the month. In addition, March 13, 2037, falls on a Friday.\n\nWhat a time to be alive.", "description": "While especially spooky, this full moon will be unusually diminutive \u2014 a micromoon.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "September At Am", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
