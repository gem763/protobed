The NDP sketched out a number of sectors in the economy with high potential for labour-absorbing growth. One such subsector was horticulture, which, among others, had the capacity to grow and create employment along the value chain, including off-farm activity and in agro-processing.\n\nSeven years after the NDP was crafted, nothing has fundamentally changed with respect to the growth opportunities that horticulture presents. In fact, global demand for horticulture and protein-rich food products has increased notably over this period. With this, South Africa\u2019s agricultural exports have also increased, amounting to US$10.6 billion in 2018, representing a 17% increase from 2012, the year of the release of the NDP.\n\nThe gains have largely been underpinned by the subsectors that were identified as potential drivers of South Africa\u2019s agricultural economy \u2013 namely horticulture as already discussed, as well as wine, grains and wool, amongst others. But the growth in exports has not been evenly distributed from a geographic and spatial point of view. In fact, growth has been concentrated in traditionally agriculture active areas, while the former homelands have seen sporadic improvement over time.\n\nIn our field visits1 in the Eastern Cape last week, where we interacted mainly with newgeneration farmers with an objective of understanding the developments at farm level in the province, the constraints that came out repeatedly were not different from those expressed by agribusiness firms and farmers in other provinces. These included the lack of access to finance, challenges regarding land governance in the communal areas, access to water, need for farming advice (effective extension services) and poor infrastructure.\n\nThis means that if South Africa is to attain its rural economic growth and job creation ambitions, the country does not need to re-invent a new vision of creating vibrant rural economies. Rather, the focus needs to be on crafting specific strategies which seek to resolve the prevailing constraints that hinder progress, such as the aforementioned ones from Eastern Cape\u2019s farmers.\n\nTargeting specific bottlenecks entails more effective coordination between the established agribusinesses, farming enterprises, communities, finance institutions and government (national and local).\n\nThis approach is premised on the assumption that there is universal buy-in on the vision articulated in the NDP. However, oftentimes, the message and vision at the national government level are not always received with the same level of enthusiasm at local government levels. Policy coordination across the different levels of government is an area which requires improvement.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Wandile Sihlobo covering: .
