Billing itself as \u201cthe leading authentic internet company,\u201d whatever that means, the newly-rechristened Yonder has neatly divested itself of New Knowledge\u2019s baggage, just in time to bury Americans in horror stories of Russian bot activity for the 2020 election cycle.\n\nThe company is under investigation by the Federal Elections Commission for meddling in the 2017 Alabama Senate race with an elaborate false-flag operation involving the creation of an army of fake \u201cRussian\u201d bots. \u201cProject Birmingham\u201d helped hand the Senate seat to Doug Jones, the first Democrat to be elected from Alabama in over two decades. Even Jones backed the inquiry after the New York Times published an expos\u00e9 on the campaign last year.\n\nAlso on rt.com The only \u2018Russian bots\u2019 to meddle in US elections belonged to Democrat-linked \u2018experts\u2019\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop New Knowledge from continuing to mercilessly milk the \u201cRussian bot\u201d fad, smearing Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard as the \u201cRussian favorite\u201d with a report that Gabbard\u2019s enemies have embraced despite its authors being thoroughly discredited. The company\u2019s founder Jonathon Morgan was also involved in the development of the Hamilton68 \u201cRussian bot\u201d dashboard, whose methodology remains proprietary even as its dubious utterances are treated as gospel truth by the media. But after being exposed as disinfo merchants by the Times, of all people, New Knowledge has struggled to be taken seriously in some circles.\n\nNone of this appears in the press release New Knowledge published on PRWeb last week to celebrate the company\u2019s new identity, of course. \u201cYonder is on a mission to humanize the world's information and deliver on the promise of a more authentic internet,\u201d declared the company whose founder was booted from Facebook for running bot armies. That mission, according to Yonder\u2019s promotional materials, is \u201chelping usher in an era where fake news, bots and other web wreckage isn\u2019t so easily blended with real human insights and interactions.\u201d The jokes write themselves.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Neocon warmongers\u2019: NBC slammed for drawing on dodgy Russiagate org in Gabbard smear\n\nThe company\u2019s core business of dressing up Cold War fears in slick information-age jargon hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 Yonder\u2019s website warns visitors that false information is \u201c70 percent more likely to be shared on social media,\u201d without explaining the context of the statistic (more likely than what or where?). It\u2019s yet another irony for a company that has promised customers it will \u201cadd the necessary cultural context to online information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a moment now where it\u2019s a real reckoning for the tech industry\u2026 I think there\u2019s a real lack of trust or loss of trust,\u201d Morgan told Austin Inno. It\u2019s hard to imagine how fearmongering about Russian bots dismantling American democracy is supposed to build trust. But as long as there are politicians who would rather blame a foreign country for their failures than engage in meaningful introspection, there will always be a market for companies like New Knowledge.\n\nAlso on rt.com You didn\u2019t really think all Russian assets & Kremlin puppets in the US have already been exposed, did you?\n\nBy Helen Buyniski, RT\n\nLike this story?
