(Gif: BBC)\n\nThe Sixth Doctor was a controversial figure, on screen and off, by the end of his tenure on Doctor Who. At the time, Colin Baker\u2019s exit was so tempestuous the actor did not return for the traditional hand-over of the role to his replacement, Sylvester McCoy. It led to one of the dodgiest wigs in Doctor Who history, but now, Baker regrets it for another reason.\n\nThe Radio Times reports that, speaking recently at a talk to celebrate the upcoming release of the 23rd season of the classic series of Who on Blu-ray \u2014 the famous \u201cTrial of a Time Lord\u201d arc, where each story was connected by a framing device of the Time Lords capturing the Doctor and putting him on, well, trial \u2014 Baker discussed his far-from-magnanimous exit from the series.\n\nThe Sixth Doctor\u2019s brusque characterisation had proven controversial among viewers and people at the BBC, and the then-controller of BBC One, Michael Grade, had publicly made clear his own disdain of Doctor Who. When the series was looking for renewal on a 24th season, Grade offered a harsh ultimatum: Remove Baker from the title role or the show was cancelled.\n\nThe production team picked firing Baker \u2014 they offered him the chance to return for one more story and finish his time as the Doctor properly, but Baker was understandably upset about his firing and flatly refused. One face-down Sylvester McCoy and an incredibly cheap wig later, viewers tuned into \u201cTime and the Rani\u201d to see... this:\n\nIt\u2019s not great. One of many, many things not great about the story, frankly \u2014 so in retrospect, a dodgy regeneration was the least of concerns facing Doctor Who at the time. But still, Baker conceded, what upsets him now is the fact that fans never got to see a regeneration done justice:\n\nThis was in November and [filming his regeneration] would take place the following March/April\u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to commit myself to two weeks work the next March/April\u2026 and I\u2019ll be honest, I was hacked off. I saw no reason to be nice to them. I forgot about [the fans] \u2013 sorry. I was being brutally selfish at the time and I just felt annoyed. Because I loved that part\u2026 and I thought I had more to offer.\n\nIt\u2019s all right, Mr. Baker, it\u2019s totally understandable as to why you didn\u2019t. The wig atop poor Sylvester McCoy\u2019s head they replaced you with is really what someone on the Who team should be apologising for.", "description": "The Sixth Doctor was a controversial figure, on screen and off, by the end of his tenure on Doctor Who.
