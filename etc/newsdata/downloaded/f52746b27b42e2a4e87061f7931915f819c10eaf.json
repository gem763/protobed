On Sunday, baseball got its revenge.\n\nThe President attended Game 5 of the World Series between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros at Nationals Park, a short journey from the White House. When Trump was shown on the video screens in the stadium he was loudly booed by fans. That, perhaps, was predictable: Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and both Bushes were all booed while attending baseball games as President. What came shortly afterwards was a little more personal in a city that is heavily Democratic as cries of \u201cLock him up!\u201d rang out, a reference to the chants about Hillary Clinton used at Trump\u2019s rallies in the run-up to the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nAdam Longo (@adamlongoTV) President Trump was booed loudly by the fans at Nats Park when he was shown on the big screen.\n\nThen came a loud chant: \u201cLock him up.\u201d @wusa9 pic.twitter.com/LBbgSAHd6k\n\nFootage of the incident swept through Twitter, showing the moment that fans inside the stadium changed from cheering to booing.\n\nJesse Yomtov (@JesseYomtov) Trump booed pic.twitter.com/9yFGKYjkga\n\nEvery US president since 1910 has thrown out a ceremonial first-pitch at a baseball game during their time in office, but Trump is the first to break with that tradition. Major League Baseball\u2019s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said the President had told him he did not want to participate in the ceremony at this year\u2019s World Series \u201cin order to make the fan experience as positive as possible\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, Trump had joked his bullet-proof vest would make it hard to throw out the first pitch. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They gotta dress me up in a lot of heavy armour. I\u2019ll look too heavy. I don\u2019t like that,\u201d he said.\n\nWorld Series Game 5: Houston Astros v Washington Nationals \u2013 live!

Andr\u00e9s has repeatedly opposed Trump\u2019s immigration policies and his government\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\n\nTrump attended the game with his wife, Melania, and several Republican politicians including Lindsey Graham, Matt Gaetz and David Perdue.", "description": "The President was greeted with boos by the crowd at Nationals Park when he attended Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night", "authors": ["Tom Lutz"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4028bd486ca1798b69673af0ff11e2f4adbee245/0_171_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c2e2f8e2a0f71d4bf6969c96a5e9b93", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
