For a limited time you can get the 64GB Pro model with a generous 100GB data cap for just $99 per month! That's easily the best bang-for-buck deal we've seen from any telco. Here are the details.\n\nOptus' $99 Promo Plus plan comes with 100GB data, unlimited national talk & text and an iPhone 11 Pro in a choice of four colours. Here are the full inclusions. (Click on the interactive table below for more details.)\n\nThere are a few iPhone 11 Pro plans out there under $100, but none of them come with this much data. For example, the closest equivalent from Telstra is capped at 15GB data:\n\nVodafone has a similar plan, but it only comes with 80GB data. It's also slightly more expensive at $99.08 per month (or $103.58 per month, sans loyalty discount.)\n\nOptus' $93 iPhone 11 Pro plan, meanwhile, only comes with a miserly 4GB of data. So that extra $6 per month is definitely worth it.\n\nThere is a pretty big caveat, however. Like the plans above, you will need to sign up to a 36-month plan which works out to total minimum spend of $3,564. That's a pretty big commitment to one telco. It means if a better deal comes along you'll need to pay out Optus to break contract.\n\nBut if you're a creature of habit, $99 for an iPhone 11 Pro with 100GB data is a damn good deal.\n\nFind more great bargains at Lifehacker Coupons.\n\nAs Lifehacker editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
