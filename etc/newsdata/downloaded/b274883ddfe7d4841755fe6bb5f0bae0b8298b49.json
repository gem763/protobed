But that\u2019s always good.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand has had a couple of long breaks at this Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe defending champions banked some hard practice during a 10-day gap between their first two pool games in Japan. Because of the Italy cancellation, they\u2019ll have had 12 days off completely before the quarterfinals.\n\nRest is good, especially at a busy World Cup, but there are signs the All Blacks are possibly getting a little restless.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re given what you ideally want, we\u2019d have loved to have played,\u201d lock Sam Whitelock said.\n\nThere\u2019s an argument that too much rest can hurt a team as players get out of practice. Hence the big game at training.\n\nBut Whitelock said there\u2019s nothing to fear. The All Blacks sometimes have two weeks off between tests in the Championship.\n\n\u201cSo, we should hopefully be in a good space for the quarterfinals,\u201d Whitelock said.\n\nNot in a good space are Italy and captain Sergio Parisse.\n\nThey\u2019re going home after being denied the chance to keep their World Cup going. Italy needed to beat the All Blacks for the first time ever and deny them a bonus point to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nParisse, the 142-test veteran who\u2019s now set to retire, ripped into Rugby World Cup organizers over the cancellation and the lack of a backup plan to deal with Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nHe believed Italy was disrespected by World Rugby and local organizers. He said the match in Toyota on Saturday, when the typhoon should hit Japan, would not have been cancelled if the All Blacks needed the points to reach the quarters.\n\nThe game was called off by organizers for safety reasons. It\u2019s the latest and biggest of around 20 typhoons to affect Japan this typhoon season.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn\u2019t news that typhoons hit Japan,\u201d Parisse said. \u201cWe had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team. The alternative is Plan B. When you organize a World Cup you should have one in place.\n\n\u201cSure, if Italy and New Zealand decide they don\u2019t want to play then fine, but if New Zealand needed the points, it wouldn\u2019t have been cancelled.\u201d\n\nWhitelock has never been in a typhoon and said \u201cyou\u2019ve got to listen to the people who know and take their advice.\u201d But he also understood where Parisse was coming from.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of frustration coming out,\u201d he said.\n\nWhitelock and some of the All Blacks have dealt with cancelled games before, when Crusaders Super Rugby home matches in Christchurch were called off in 2011 because of the deadly earthquake, and last March after the deadly Mosque shootings in that city.\n\n\u201cIn both instances you understand why,\u201d Whitelock said.\n\n\u201cRugby\u2019s just a small thing. We tend to get carried away with it a little bit, we\u2019re so passionate about rugby, and we always want to go out and play, but sometimes the right thing is not playing. There would be nothing worse than if we did play and people were getting hurt.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With the Italy game canceled because of Typhoon Hagibis, the All Blacks are going to have a crack at each other instead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/japan_rugby_wcup_new_zealand_namibia_11106_c0-172-2431-1590_s1200x700.jpg?880ccf595703e6c572d1f9713800e11ee499136e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
