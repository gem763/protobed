In just a few days\u2019 time, only Michael Schumacher will stand ahead of him on the all-time list. It is the rarest distinction, and one that could not be more richly deserved.\n\nFor all the temptation to take Hamilton\u2019s wins for granted, this 83rd career triumph was hardly a fate foretold. In recent years, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez has been by far Mercedes\u2019 weakest circuit, with their cars\u2019 downforce compromised by the rarefied air. Add to this the handicap of starting only third, behind two Ferraris blessed with superior straight-line speed, and it required a masterclass even to entertain the thought of winning. Hamilton, sensing the championship in sight, delivered it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible result,\u201d he said, in the bearpit of the track\u2019s stadium section, where 100,000 had assembled to salute home hero Sergio Perez. \u201cWe came here thinking we were on the back foot, but we pulled through. The race was quite a struggle, but I kept my head down.\u201d", "description": "At a track of extreme elevation, Lewis Hamilton proved again that he belonged in his own racing stratosphere.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Luke Slater", "Chief Sports Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214355547-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgRl8BouVbC6HZnydG5Kn5pdzd29AV1S6GkBHLgjhxoY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
