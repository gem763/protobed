Hussain was convicted of manslaughter, but Ahmed was acquitted. Mr Visiter's family wept in court as the verdicts were announced.\n\nJames Mulholland, QC, prosecuting, said Mr Visiter suffered four wounds 'delivered with considerable force' in the attack. He added: 'Both of the wounds on the chest were fatal injuries. They penetrated the right lung.\n\nA CCTV image of Hussain inside the mosque in North West London next to a pile of shoes\n\n'The result was massive blood loss and internal haemorrhaging followed by collapse and unconsciousness.'\n\nMr Visiter had left his home a few minutes earlier and was waiting to meet an individual somewhere near his flat to hand over some money.\n\n'During their time together that afternoon Sarah Akapelwa recalled her boyfriend receving about five or six calls which he answered out of her hearing.\n\n'At one point she was so concerned about this that she asked him if another girl was ringing him which he denied.'\n\nMoments after the stabbing Hussain and Ahmed were caught on CCTV sprinting towards the mosque, entering the building at underground level.\n\n'They basically head for the washroom where worshippers at the mosque perform their ablutions and cleanse themselves before going to prayer,' said Mr Mulholland.\n\n'They head straight in and they head for a cubicle. As Mr Ahmed is following he has his shoes in his hands rather than leaving them outside.\n\nArmed police search the mosque near Regent's Park in London on the evening of March 28\n\n'You see a gentleman in the middle stop him and consequently Mr Ahmed goes and leaves his shoes outside.\n\n'He deposits the shoes outside and puts on a pair of flip flops and heads for the same cubicle as Mr Hussain, a small cubicle.\n\n'He's in there for several minutes and again this is key to what they're doing and why this whole thing is clearly pre-meditated.\n\n'When he comes out he is wearing only a t-shirt and so he's removing himself of anything in terms of hoody that could be used to identify him and what he does is he comes back out, puts his trainers back on, and then he walks up the stairs to the ground level where the main hall is for prayers.\n\n'He walks around to see if there are any police in that area and adjusts his tracksuit bottoms, lifts them up to make them look like shorts and tucks them up around his knees.\n\n'He goes back into the cubicle where Mr Hussain has remained before they both emerge.\n\nPolice investigating after the armed raid on the Regent's Park mosque in London in March\n\n'Note the difference in Hussain's appearance, he's removed the outer clothing, the gilet, the dark green hoody and he's now wearing a T-shirt and carrying the other clothing.\n\n'He's also wearing shorts and he's taken off his jeans. They go to a corner and Mr Hussain deposits the clothing he has removed and placed it in the corner.\n\n'He's followed by Mr Ahmed who does exactly the same thing.\n\n'They leave through a different gate in the complex and there's no doubt they are trying to leave the mosque compound to that which they entered.'\n\nGiving evidence Ahmed claimed he had been in the area to buy cannabis and only ran because he was 'frightened and scared' when Hussain shouted: 'There's two undies (undercover police) there, let's run'.\n\nAhmed said he spent the next few days with Hussain because he 'had nowhere else to go', the court heard.\n\nHussain claimed admitted they had entered the mosque to change their appearance but claimed it was because they had some cannabis on them and did not want to be searched.\n\nAhmed, of St John's Wood, and Hussain, of no fixed address, both denied murder. Hussain was convicted of an alternative charge of manslaughter.\n\nHe will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on November 15 at 2pm.", "description": "Kamal Hussain, 22, and Yosef Ahmed, 18, rode up to Zahir Visiter in St John's Wood, North West London, and Hussain stabbed him four times, then watched as people rushed to help.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20182050-0-image-a-26_1572011971595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
