(Scott Barbour/Getty Images, Random House Canada)\n\nTegan: \"This book made me laugh. The movie adaptation came out when we were in high school. We asked for the book for Christmas and consumed it.

It was the first time I'd ever read a book that included a queer love story. In the book, one of the protagonists goes to New York City and becomes involved with a woman who is a musician.\n\nBooks saved me. They gave me a way to imagine a future for myself. - Sara Quin\n\n\"There was also something that was compelling about that. It allowed me to imagine a world where I might be able to have a romance, or that I might be able to fall in love or be loved. It gave me an opportunity to sort of imagine my own future.\"\n\nThe Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel\n\nThe Clan of the Cave Bear is a 1980s book series of prehistoric fiction by Jean M. Auel.

I don't read anything like that now, but at the time I became really consumed by it. There was so much focus on the female characters. That was probably why my mom read it \u2014and then she would give us anything that she bought.\"\n\nMargaret Atwood is the author of The Handmaid's Tale. (Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images, Penguin Random House)\n\nSara: \"My grandmother was obsessed with Margaret Atwood. She loved, loved her books. I remember reading The Handmaid's Tale and not understanding why my grandmother was so compelled by the writing. She always seemed so buttoned up, conservative and conventional. Now as an adult, I can see that she was using books and reading as a way to escape the life that she was supposed to live, which is sort of heartening to me now.\"\n\nTegan and Sara's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The famous identical twins and authors of the memoir High School reflect on their love of books and reading.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299202.1569542625!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/high-school-by-tegan-and-sara-quin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
