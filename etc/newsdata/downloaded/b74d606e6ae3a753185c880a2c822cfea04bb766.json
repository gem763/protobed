REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Illustration\n\nThe issue of whether ranitidine, commonly known as Zantac, causes levels of the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) to rise in users\u2019 bodies has been raised previously by Valisure, an online pharmacy that originally flagged the potential contamination of ranitidine to the FDA.\n\nZantac, sold over-the-counter in the United States by French drugmaker Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), and some of its generic versions, have been recalled due to possible NDMA contamination of pills that had not yet been consumed. The FDA said earlier this month it found unacceptable levels of NDMA in drugs containing ranitidine.\n\nBut FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said the regulator is now \u201cworking to understand what happens to NDMA levels in the body, after ranitidine has been exposed to acid in the stomach.\u201d\n\nZantac has been on the market for more than 35 years and was originally sold by Glaxo Holdings Ltd, now a part of GlaxoSmithKline PLC. (GSK.L) At one point it was the top-selling drug in the world.\n\nRepresentatives of GSK and Sanofi were not immediately available for comment.\n\nValisure\u2019s Chief Executive David Light said it was important that the FDA is investigating the issue because the company\u2019s data suggests the NDMA levels that can be formed in the body \u201care many magnitudes of order higher than what\u2019s been talked about in the contamination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the main red flags we\u2019ve raised the whole time \u2014 not just contamination but the fact that this is happening in the human body,\u201d Light said.\n\nSanofi said last week it would recall the drug in the United States and Canada. Other drugmakers including GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis (NOVN.S) have recalled or halted distribution of their versions of the drug.\n\nRetailers including Walmart Inc (WMT.N), CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) have stopped selling ranitidine.\n\nThe FDA said on Wednesday that early tests of alternatives to Zantac such as Pepcid, Tagamet, Nexium, Prevacid and Prilosec have not been found to contain NDMA.\n\nNDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers. Those impurities are believed to have been introduced by recent changes in the manufacturing process.", "description": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether the popular heartburn drug Zantac causes carcinogens to form in the bodies of users, in an effort to fully understand the risks posed by the already recalled drug, the agency's spokesman said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Michael Erman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444658062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N214", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
