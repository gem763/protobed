With the New England Patriots, they remained the only undefeated squads in the NFL through Week 5.\n\nThe game marked another setback for Cleveland (2-3), with Baker Mayfield struggling to build on last week's success. The Browns entered the year with high expectations but haven't been able to get over the .500 hump.\n\nNotable Fantasy Performances\n\nBaker Mayfield, QB, Browns: 8-of-22, 100 yards, 2 INTs\n\nNick Chubb, RB, Browns: 16 carries, 87 yards\n\nOdell Beckham Jr., WR, Browns: 2 catches, 27 yards; 2 carries, 15 yards\n\nJarvis Landry, WR, Browns: 4 catches, 75 yards\n\nJimmy Garoppolo, QB, 49ers: 20-of-29, 181 yards, 2 TDs\n\nMatt Breida, RB, 49ers: 11 carries, 114 yards, 1 TD\n\nTevin Coleman, RB, 49ers: 16 carries, 97 yards, 1 TD\n\nGeorge Kittle, TE, 49ers: 6 catches, 70 yards, 1 TD\n\nSan Francisco Pressure Stymies Baker Mayfield\n\nOne of the biggest question marks going into the season for Cleveland was its offensive line, and that unit was overmatched against San Francisco.\n\nThe defensive line put pressure on Mayfield all night and gave him little room to work:\n\nRookie Nick Bosa was especially impressive in a dominant first half as the 49ers built a 21-3 lead:\n\nHe finished with two of the team's four sacks, while Mayfield was pressured into multiple mistakes:\n\nThe quarterback can make better decisions, but it's tough to expect the offensive line to suddenly improve, especially with the Seattle Seahawks and Patriots looming around a Week 7 bye.\n\nRushing Attack Carries 49ers Offense\n\nHead coach Kyle Shanahan's system is working well, but the 49ers have a lot of talent in the backfield.\n\nMatt Breida was the biggest difference-maker on offense with two first-half touchdowns, including an 83-yarder on San Francisco's first play from scrimmage:\n\nWhen Breida was on the sideline, Tevin Coleman showcased his skill in his first game back from a high ankle sprain that cost him almost a month:\n\nThe pair helped lead an attack that finished with 275 rushing yards. That was even without Jeff Wilson Jr., who was a healthy scratch after scoring four touchdowns in the last two games.\n\nIt kept the pressure off Garoppolo, who didn't throw an interception for the first time this season.\n\nAn injury to fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who sprained his knee Monday, could hurt, but the running backs were impressive in the national spotlight.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nThe Browns will face another NFC West opponent in Week 6, hosting the 4-1 Seahawks. The 49ers will have their first divisional game of the season Sunday with a road tilt against the 3-2 Los Angeles Rams.", "description": "The San Francisco 49ers stayed undefeated Monday with a 31-3 win over the Cleveland Browns.
