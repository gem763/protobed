Bidding farewell to transitional favourites like light jackets and midi skirts can be something we avoid until the frostbite begins to creep up our toes.\n\nThis October has already seen heavy downfalls and temperatures that bounce around from one day to the next, making the move from autumn into winter that bit trickier. Will our outift need to withstand dramatic downpours or bursts of sunshine? How can we be taken seriously at work whilst also wearing a child's yellow Petit Bateau raincoat? And how can we sate our appetite for a wardrobe revival when the world is in the midst of a climate crisis?\n\nBut there is one solution: instead of panic beelining to your nearest high street, why not delve into the deepest, darkest corners of your wardrobe and rework some of your old favourites?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look very far for inspiration either, with designers and street style stars showing us new and innovative ways of wearing all kinds of seasonal staples, from scarves to knee-high boots.\n\nRead on for our tips on how to fall back in love with the wardrobe items you already own this season.\n\nThe statement scarf\n\n(Getty Images/Rex Features) To an outside, the humble scarf may seem like a slave to practicality: something to wrap around your neck and keep you from catching a cold. But one look at the autumn/winter runways and you\u2019ll see that scarves are packing a fashion punch this season. At Margaret Howell, models wore yolky yellow ones that offset the more muted shades of their otherwise traditional outfits. Over on the Versace catwalk, scarves came in fluffy leopard prints and woven checks.\n\nThe street style set has followed suit. All over Instagram, fashion influencers are making the most of these simple strips of fabric, with some donning oversized woollen ones and others wearing brighter shades to add vibrance to monochrome looks. Even off-duty models are wrapping themselves in sumptuous cashmere styles to mollycoddle themselves as they venture around town. We suggest seeking out your most decadent scarf \u2013 ideally something with a print or pattern \u2013 and immersing yourself in it in the place of a jacket if the weather allows; the silhouette will mimic those seen on the runways and allow the your scarf to shine as a standout item in your ensemble.\n\nThe polo-neck jumper\n\nPolo necks have made a triumphant return in recent years, having been the reserve of geography teachers for quite some time. But really, we've all got one because of their endless warmth potential and now's the time to crack yours out.\n\nThey're warm, secure and instantly elevate any workwear look. If you\u2019ve tired of yours already, fear not. For JW Anderson\u2019s autumnn/winter 2019 collection, the British designer paired grey and white polo-neck jumpers with feathered skirts and leather sandals. You could do the same, switching feathers for pleats and sandals for trainers for a more accessible workwear look \u2013 feathered skirts are a tad niche.\n\nMeanwhile, the street style crowd are pairing their polo-necks with tailoring \u2013 a classic combination that can be easily refreshed with contrasting fits (try an oversized suit with a tight-fitting polo-neck underneath ) and statement stilettos.\n\nIf the weather is really chilly, you could try wearing your polo neck underneath a second jumper, ideally something with a round-neck and a slogan on the front for an extra fashion punch.\n\nThe knee-high boot\n\nLast winter, it was all about finding the perfect chunky hiking boot. While we're not suggesting you chuck yours away anytime soon (*we are still wearing ours to death and will forever more), the boot to note this season is a little taller and slouchier.\n\nKnee-high boots have been around for millennia (in fashion terms), but the hype this winter shows no signs of abating. At Alexander McQueen, models stomped down the runway in black leather ones with scarlet laces. Over at Celine, the mood was more nostalgic and 1970s-inspired, with knee-highs coming in mustard shades with chunky heels.\n\nThese boots are traditionally worn over jeans - think Princess Diana, who sported this combo religiously - but to spruce yours up this season, we suggest wearing knee-highs underneath billowing midi skirts or dresses, a look we saw on countless catwalks in February.\n\nThe high-waisted, straight-cut jeans\n\nHigh-waisted jeans will always have a place in our wardrobe, no matter what time of year, but given the range of trouser styles now in fashion (hello flares, cropped and winter woollen ones), we wouldn't blame you for tiring of your trust old 501s.\n\nIf you want to reinvigorate high-waisted jeans for winter (and why wouldn't you, considering how comfortable and flattering they are and, most importantly, warm), try following in the footsteps of fashion influencers like Camille Charriere, who paired hers with a matching denim jacket. Or look to Celine's spring/summer 2020 show, where double denim was a running theme throughout the collection.\n\nIt might have been satirised by noughties stars like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears, but double denim, aka the Canadian Tuxedo, is totally acceptable today, and an irresistibly easy casual look.\n\nThe double breasted blazer\n\nNothing elevates an outfit quite like the double-breasted blazer. You might already own one as part of a suit, but feel free to take it out in isolation this winter. Look to Rejina Pyo, who styled her burnt orange blazer over mustard jodhpurs and riding boots, or, if you really must stick to the suit, try wrapping a belt around the jacket's waist to create a cinched-in fit.\n\nAs for what to wear underneath, try a simple collared shirt or a polo-neck jumper. Depending on how high the neck is, you could even try wearing nothing at all.", "description": "Shifting our sartorial habits at the start of a new season always requires some adjustment.
