For all intents and purposes, you betcha. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has steadily moved closer to Donald Trump over the last two-plus years on the direction of national security and foreign policy as others, such as James Mattis and John Kelly, have hit the exits. Bolton\u2019s bolting leaves Pompeo as Trump\u2019s last man standing:\n\nThe departure of John Bolton as national security adviser puts Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the driver\u2019s seat for the administration\u2019s foreign policy debates. With his chief rival for influence with the president suddenly out of the picture, Pompeo will have more autonomy and freedom to operate without being blocked by his polar opposite in style and temperament.\n\nWhy not, then, make it official? Kellyanne Conway tells Fox News Channel\u2018s Martha MacCallum that Trump has five others under consideration for nat-sec adviser, but Pompeo would be \u201cfive-plus.\u201d And it wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented, an argument Conway appeared very prepared to make this morning:\n\nWatch the latest video at foxnews.com\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented,\u201d Conway told Fox News, referring to Henry Kissinger\u2019s occupation of both offices for two years under former Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. \u201cUnder that scenario, I would call that five-plus, as the number of candidates,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut clearly, [the] secretary of state has the president\u2019s ear and his trust, and has been making great strides in implementing the president\u2019s agenda around the globe, and he will continue to be a very important, strong voice here as America\u2019s top diplomat.\u201d Conway suggested that even if Pompeo does not assume leadership of the National Security Council from his perch at the State Department, he will play an outsized role advising the president on the selection of the administration\u2019s fourth national security adviser. \u201cI believe that Secretary of State Pompeo is doing an excellent job over at State, and that he will, of course, have input into who the next NSC head is, as well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are many people of diverse backgrounds, all solid candidates, I know first-hand the president is considering for that position.\u201d\n\nIs a Nixon/Ford precedent really all that politically beneficial? It does exist, though, and there\u2019s no particular bar against it, although it does mean that the Senate has more influence over nat-sec direction by dint of its oversight of Secretaries of State. That might be cheery news for Senate Republicans concerned that the next person to fill Bolton\u2019s role could end up being Rand Paul. In fact, I\u2019d be surprised if Paul wasn\u2019t under consideration for the job, given his frequent input to Trump already and Trump\u2019s informal assignment of the Iran portfolio to Paul.\n\nIn fact, the rift among the GOP foreign-policy factions has erupted into the open after Bolton\u2019s departure, with Paul on one pole and practically everyone else on the other. Liz Cheney has taken the lead in challenging Paul, and it\u2019s getting ugly:\n\nFox News\u2019s Steve Hilton denounced her and said her father, former vice president Dick Cheney, was \u201cliterally\u201d responsible for \u201cmillions of deaths.\u201d Two Republican state House members in Cheney\u2019s home state of Wyoming authored a Washington Examiner op-ed calling on Cheney to \u201cstop carping at Trump for rejecting endless war.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who could be Cheney\u2019s Senate colleague in the relatively near future, lifted that op-ed up Wednesday and said, \u201cI agree! Why do some neocons continue to advocate for endless wars?\u201d Cheney shot back, \u201cI stand with @realDonaldTrump and our men and women in uniform who will never surrender to terrorists, unlike @RandPaul, who seems to have forgotten that today is 9/11,\u201d she said. Paul\u2019s chief political strategist, Doug Stafford, followed that up by tweeting at Cheney, \u201cActually, @realDonaldTrump loves @RandPaul and I\u2019m pretty sure they both think your family is a bunch of chickenhawk warmongers who personally benefited from the military industrial complex and are responsible for thousands of lost lives and trillions of lost dollars.\u201d If there\u2019s a better metaphor for the GOP\u2019s current foreign policy transformation and crossroads, it\u2019s tough to do better than a Paul scion feuding with a Cheney scion. But as Bolton\u2019s excommunication and recent developments show, it\u2019s clearly the Paul-ite, non-interventionist approach that is ascendant in the Trump administration.\n\nThat\u2019s actually not clear at all, although it\u2019s one of a few different currents at play. Trump can\u2019t seem to make up his mind whether he wants a hardline approach to national security or go the full, Paulite non-interventionist route. Pompeo may be the best man to bridge that gap at the moment, but Trump needs to pick a strategy and stick with it, as I argue in my column for The Week:\n\nOne could propose that Trump\u2019s reliance on the generals, as well as Bolton\u2019s hiring, was intended to build the oft-claimed \u201cteam of rivals\u201d around a president, but that doesn\u2019t fit Trump\u2019s temperament or instincts. It looked more like an attempt to knit all Republican factions together in the same administration to show that they can co-exist within a broad coalition. Unfortunately, Bolton\u2019s exit \u2014 and that of other key national security team members \u2014 suggests the opposite is true. This disconnect will force a day of reckoning on national security and foreign policy between Trump and GOP leadership, almost certainly sooner rather than later. Mattis has been circumspect about his relationship with Trump in public, but his new memoir on leadership and foreign policy stresses the values of teamwork and alliances, both of which Trump\u2019s instincts discount. Bolton will likely be more vocal and direct about his conflicts with Trump on policy, even without a memoir to sell. The debate that arises will test Republicans\u2019 ability to overlook Trump\u2019s non-interventionist impulses at a time when Trump needs as much party loyalty as possible. As his re-election bid approaches, Trump might need to make more of an effort to find middle ground with his party\u2019s desire to project American power around the world, or risk losing too many allies at home to keep those peace efforts going.\n\nIf combining the roles under Pompeo can quell the Cheney-Paul tension in the GOP, then perhaps it\u2019s the smart move. If Trump does decide to choose a separate nat-sec adviser, that candidate should be aware that Pompeo\u2019s got the inside track with Trump, and that Trump\u2019s mercurial approach to strategy will make even a subsidiary advisory position difficult at best.", "description": "The cure for the Cheney-Paul blues?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/conway-fox-pompeo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
