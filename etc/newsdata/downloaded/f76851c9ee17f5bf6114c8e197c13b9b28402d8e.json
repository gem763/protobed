No wonder unions are losing so much. The workers will vote for me in 2020 (lowest unemployment, most jobs ever), and should stop paying exorbitant $Dues, not worth it!\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace that aired Sunday, Trumka called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u201cunenforceable,\u201d and said he could not support it in its current form.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAn unenforceable trade agreement is a windfall for corporations and a disaster for workers,\u201d Trumka said.\n\nThe union responded that it has been consistent in its position on trade.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been clear on what working people want, in private and in public,\" AFL-CIO press secretary John Weber told FOX Business. \"It\u2019s our job to tell the president what he needs to hear \u2014 not what he wants to hear.\"\n\nTrump also hit back at New York Times columnist Paul Krugman Monday, noting the performance of the stock market and wealth creation in the U.S.\n\n\u201cSince my election, many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our Country, and the Stock Market is up over 50%,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. \u201cIf you followed the advice of the Failing New York Times columnist, Paul Krugman, you\u2019d be doing VERY poorly - you\u2019d be angry and hurt. He never got it!\u201d\n\nKrugman\u2019s most recent column, from Thursday, went after the farmers who support Trump despite the trade war that is making it harder for them to do business.\n\n\u201cFarmers\u2019 support for Trump should be seen as a form of affinity fraud, in which people fall for a con man whom they imagine to be someone like them,\u201d Krugman wrote. \u201cAnd as is often the case in such frauds, the con man and his associates actually have contempt for their marks.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "President Trump claimed AFL-CIO Richard Trumka is a different person in the White House than in front of TV cameras.", "authors": ["Paul Conner"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/12/0/0/Richard20Trumka20RTR20FBN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
