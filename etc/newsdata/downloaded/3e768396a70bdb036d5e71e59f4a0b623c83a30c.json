However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them.\n\n'Dishonourable thing to do'\n\nOn Saturday, the US State Department said diplomatic immunity was \"rarely waived\".\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the US Embassy to reconsider.\n\nMr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, said leaving the country was \"such a dishonourable thing to do\" and urged Ms Sacoolas to come back.\n\n\"We don't wish her any harm. She's a mum; we don't want to take her away from her kids either, but she's taken one of ours and she's taken my twin boys' twinship away,\" she told BBC 5 Live.\n\nImage copyright Family photo Image caption Harry Dunn, from Charlton, Banbury, died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo\n\nMs Charles said if the diplomatic waiver was declined then funds raised by friends and family would be used to go to Washington.\n\n\"We will go and see President Trump. We will ask him to waive it; we will ask him directly. We will do what we can to bring her back,\" she said.\n\nIf that failed, the family would campaign for a change in the law around diplomatic immunity, she said.\n\n\"It's a horrible situation we're finding ourselves in, but if we sit back and do nothing and we don't at least try to bring her back to face justice or if we don't at least try and change the laws we could never live with ourselves if this happens to another family.\"\n\nNorthamptonshire's chief constable Nick Adderley said he had written to the US Embassy in London urging it to waive diplomatic immunity.\n\nHe said both he and the county's Police and Crime Commissioner, Stephen Mold, had called for the waiver \"in order to allow the justice process to take place\".\n\nThe US State Department said it was in \"close consultation\" with British officials and has offered its \"deepest sympathies\" to the family of Mr Dunn.", "description": "US diplomat's wife Anne Sacoolas is a suspect in inquiries into motorcyclist Harry Dunn's death.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q9glz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
