Nationals' 26-year-old forced into World Series action with Max Scherzer injury", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: Trysta Krick breaks down all the action from Game 4 of the World Series where the Astros evened the series at 2-2 by beating the Nationals 8-1. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As Max Scherzer made his way to Nationals Park, he knew the neck and back issue that has pained him for the last few days wouldn't let him take the ball in Game 5 of the World Series.\n\nSo he sent fellow teammate pitcher Joe Ross a text letting Ross know he'd be the one starting opposite the Houston Astros' Gerrit Cole on Sunday.\n\nLosing an ace for into the most pivotal game of the series is a blow the Nationals will have to handle if they want to take a 3-2 lead back to Houston and not find themselves in a hole after winning the first two games on the Astros' turf. That task will begin with Ross, who Nationals manager Dave Martinez said will go as long as he can.\n\nIn 2011, Ross was a first-round pick by the San Diego Padres out of Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland, California. Three years later, the Padres included the 26-year-old as part of a three-team deal with Washington and the Tampa Bay Rays, the same trade that sent shortstop Trea Turner to the Nationals.\n\nJoe Ross pitched two scoreless innings in the Nationals' Game 3 loss.

He debuted in 2015, posting a 3.54 ERA in 16 games and then a 3.43 mark in 19 starts in 2016. But Ross underwent Tommy John surgery in July 2017 and missed 14 months before returning to make three starts in September 2018.\n\nRoss started this season in the bullpen and bounced back and forth between the majors and Class AAA, but found a groove in the rotation in August. In eight starts down the stretch, Ross had a 2.75 ERA and allowed just two home runs across 39 \u2153 innings.\n\nIn Game 3 of the World Series, his first postseason outing since 2016, Ross delivered two scoreless frames and allowed one baserunner.\n\n\"Watching Joe Ross pitch the other night, I thought he looked extremely polished in what he was able to do,\" Scherzer said before Sunday's game.\n\n\"In our clubhouse we just believe the next guy up can always get the job done. Right now it's come down to Joe.\"", "description": "With Max Scherzer scratched from his Game 5 start, 26-year-old right-hander Joe Ross will take the mound for the Nationals.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
