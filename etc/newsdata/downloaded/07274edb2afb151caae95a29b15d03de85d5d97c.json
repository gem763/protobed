He calls this payment, \"inheritance for all,\" the site reported.\n\nThe cash payment is part of Piketty's proposal for fixing wealth inequality.\n\nIt's not clear from the Bloomberg story how the \"inheritance for all\" payment would be funded and Piketty did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for clarification.
