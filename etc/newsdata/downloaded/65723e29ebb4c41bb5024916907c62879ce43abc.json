(AP) \u2014 Keep him talking, don\u2019t interrupt him and, no matter what, don\u2019t ask why he killed his victims.\n\nThose were the instructions Texas Ranger James Holland gave to the dozens of homicide detectives around the country when they got their moment with Samuel Little, hoping to solve decades-old cold cases and bring back answers to desperate families from the man the FBI identified this month as the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.\n\nLittle ultimately spilled forth with chilling confessions, claiming he killed 93 women in all between 1970 and 2005 and smilingly recounting the details with startling clarity. But to get what they needed, detectives had to employ a certain amount of psychology, some of which made them uncomfortable, such as laughing along with him or putting up with his flirting.\n\nMiami-Dade Police homicide detective David Denmark and his partner interviewed Little last October about two murders in the Miami area from the 1970s. Holland had told them what to expect.\n\n\u201cYou have to change your attitude and you have to become his friend,\u201d Denmark said. \u201cAnd you have to laugh with him and make fun of his victims sometimes, sort of like, \u2018Yeah, I guess at that point she deserved it.\u2019 Even though you hate saying it. You want him to think, \u2018These guys are pretty cool\u2019 to keep him talking.\u201d\n\nFor Denmark, Little recalled his first victim, 33-year-old Mary Brosley, saying that he would never again try to bury a body in Florida\u2019s hard limestone soil and that he had to leave part of her leg exposed. He also confessed to killing 25-year-old Angela Chapman in 1976, saying he started to drown her, then pulled her out of the water and strangled her.\n\nHe remembered Brosley\u2019s flowered sundress and how he played with her chain necklace and marveled at her beautiful neck before strangling her.\n\nBrosley\u2019s sister Clare Coppolino said she had no idea her sister had moved to Florida, describing it as \u201can absolute shock\u201d when she heard from the detective after nearly 50 years. She said her initial reaction to Little\u2019s crime was \u201canger, but then more pity for him than anything. Pity to think, \u2018I don\u2019t know what his background was,\u2019 but to think this man ended up murdering all these women.\u201d\n\nLittle, 79, is now serving multiple life sentences for three killings in California. He also pleaded guilty to a 1994 murder in Odessa, Texas. Holland elicited scores of confessions from him last year in Texas and then set the guidelines for detectives who would later arrive in the state one by one with stacks of old case files from California to Florida. The detectives would visit him as if on an assembly line, with sometimes two or three agents a day going in.\n\nThe killer has also drawn remarkably detailed, color portraits of dozens of his victims that have proved helpful in cracking cases.\n\nPolice around the country have confirmed about 50 of his confessions so far and consider the rest credible.\n\nAs Little detailed his crimes, he showed no remorse, talked candidly, almost proudly, and seemed to be enjoying himself, detectives said.\n\nAt one point, he smiled when recalling a murder, and Detective Mali Langton from Fort Myers, Florida, found the corners of her own mouth turn up \u2014 and was horrified.\n\n\u201cHe was giddy. That\u2019s what threw me,\u201d Langton said. She said that Little also flirted with her and that Holland had braced her for that, telling her to \u201cjust let it happen.\u201d\n\nHolland also told detectives not to bombard Little with questions, just be patient and let him fill in the details. If he tilts his head to the side and scratches his neck with the back of his hand, don\u2019t interrupt him; he\u2019s going back in time and reliving the crimes. When he pats his leg a certain way, pretend not to notice; he\u2019s getting aroused thinking about the killings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really big on respect,\u201d said Lubbock, Texas, Detective Brandon Price. \u201cIf he sees disrespect in the room, then sometimes that may end the interview.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you showed emotion, you\u2019re excited or get angry, then that could end the interview. We made sure to maintain a poker face.\u201d\n\nDetective Sgt. Michael Mongeluzzo of Florida\u2019s Marion County questioned Little about Rosie Hill , a 20-year-old woman who was picked up at a bar and strangled, her body left next to a pig pen in 1982. Mongeluzzo called the victim\u2019s mother, Minnie Hill, and told her his last question to Little would be whatever had been weighing on her mind all these years.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I just want to know why,'\u201d the detective said.\n\nKnowing he had to be careful how he phrased the question to the serial killer, Mongeluzzo remarked on how Little had gotten away with so many slayings over the years, and Little offered a glimpse into his motive.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when he started talking about God and how \u2018When God made me, he knew what I would do,'\u201d the detective said, adding that Little believed he was doing what he was \u201cmade to do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida, and David Warren in Dallas contributed to this report.", "description": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.
