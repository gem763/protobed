It's around 200 every year.\n\n\"We're usually after three players, so we might be talking to nine in reality.\n\n\"What you are referring to in the original question does happen, but it's less likely to happen give our closed-door approach to recruitment targets.\n\n\"But it does exist and we have to be wary of that [players using the club].\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\n\"Sometimes, the amount of time a player or his agent invests into discussions, meetings and contracts shows that there is an interest.\n\n\"If it was only a flippant interest then they could go and put a fake story then go to a club president and go say 'Look at who is in for me.' That happens all the time as well.\n\n\"What sometimes also happens is that we do have a player in an agreed position, but his club refuse to sell and, because the club refuse to sell, the player then uses that to get a new contract.\n\n\"From our perspective, we have to try and see through it and make sure that the club is not being used.\n\n\"We don't waste time, we're more robust.\"", "description": "Man Utd chief Ed Woodward has given an insight into the frustration they often face in the transfer market", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Pa Wire", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13117287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shrewsbury-Town-v-Manchester-United-Emirates-FA-Cup-Fifth-Round-New-Meadow-22216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
