Reminder: There are 111 days until the Iowa caucuses and 385 days until the 2020 election.\n\nWith the clock ticking down toward the start of voting, Democratic candidates are getting more serious \u2014 and desperate. Twelve among those still running qualified to appear Tuesday night at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, hosted by CNN and the New York Times \u2014 the largest field ever to assemble on one stage for a presidential debate. All of them have the same basic checklist of avoiding gaffes, scoring a viral moment and remembering to plug their website, but each also has a specific agenda, based on their poll standing and positioning. Here is what each hopes to achieve tonight:\n\nTHE FRONTRUNNERS\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nNational: 23.4 percent\n\nIowa: 22.7 percent\n\nStatus update: Warren is literally the only major candidate who is doing better in the polls now than she was at the start of the summer, having clawed her way back from single digits to lead Joe Biden in Iowa, New Hampshire and many national surveys. Lately she\u2019s been picking a fight with Facebook over its policy of allowing politicians to lie in ads; to make her point, she posted an ad on the network with the intentionally false claim that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed President Trump for reelection.\n\nTonight\u2019s goal: Warren has enjoyed a long run of good press and kid-glove treatment from her rivals. In recent weeks, several of them \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Biden \u2014 have signaled that the honeymoon is over, launching mild attacks (from both sides) on Warren over her position on Medicare for All. But nothing has knocked the Massachusetts senator off her stride. They\u2019ll almost certainly try again tonight, giving Warren a chance to show off her defensive skills \u2014 and, if she succeeds, to continue to build momentum.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nNational: 29.4 percent\n\nIowa: 19.3 percent\n\nStatus update: For weeks now, the former vice president has been fending off an onslaught from the current president over Ukraine, with Trump trying to falsely tar Biden and his son Hunter, and Biden struggling to respond. But it\u2019s important to note that Biden\u2019s poll numbers haven\u2019t declined at all over that period (even as Warren\u2019s have risen). And lately he seems to have found his footing, unveiling an ethics plan on Monday that directly targets Trump and accuses him of creating the \u201cmost corrupt administration in modern history.\u201d\n\nTonight\u2019s goal: A plurality of Americans now say they believe Trump\u2019s accusations are hurting Biden\u2019s prospects of becoming the Democratic nominee. Biden\u2019s job Tuesday night is to prove them wrong \u2014 to show on live national TV that he can handle the incoming. His main rivals might be wary of attacking him about Ukraine, lest they appear to be endorsing Trump\u2019s attack, but the moderators are almost sure to ask about it \u2014 especially since Hunter Biden just gave his first interview on the subject to \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Tuesday morning.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates, from top left: Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke.

Other than Warren, he has built the biggest and best early-state ground game. He has the cash and campaign infrastructure to go the distance. But after peaking in the spring, Buttigieg has failed to take off in the polls \u2014 with one exception: Iowa. There, the South Bend, Ind., mayor has gained 5 points over the last month, in large part by positioning himself as a center-left alternative to Warren and Biden.", "description": "Tonight\u2019s goals: A plurality of Americans now say they believe Trump's accusations are hurting Biden's prospects of becoming the Democratic nominee.
