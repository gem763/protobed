It depends on the terms of the lease. (Dreamstime)\n\nQ: I am a tenant in a building that was recently de-converted from condos to apartments. Prior to the de-conversion, I had rented the condo from the same owner for many years.\n\nThe sale of the condo building occurred late last year. In conjunction with the sale, all owners who were renting their units were required to return all security deposits and interest back to their tenants before the closing. I never received my security deposit back.\n\nI contacted the law firm handling the sale before the closing and told it to have the money paid to me from the closing. The law firm was falsely led by the owner to believe that he was going to pay me the day before the closing.\n\n[More Matters: Rodent problems in your condo building? Your condo association should take action.]\n\nAs part of the sale, the lease I had with the condo owner was transferred to the new owner. The new owner is a large real estate investment company. I am aware that as an Illinois resident, I can file a lawsuit against the previous condo owner for the amount of my security deposit plus penalties. Is the lawsuit my only recourse, or is it now the responsibility of the new owner of the apartment complex to return my security deposit to me?\n\nA: Well, the fact that you didn\u2019t get your security deposit returned to you and are reduced to chasing the old or new owners in court doesn\u2019t seem right to us. But let\u2019s start at the beginning. In parts of the country where home prices haven\u2019t really recovered, condo de-conversions have become quite popular.\n\nIn some areas of the country, including Chicago, condominium buildings are going through a phase in which they are changing from condos back to apartment rental buildings owned by a landlord.\n\nA short course on the way condo de-conversions work: When condo prices stagnate or fall in the open market, a landlord may look at the building and do some math on what value the units would bring as rental properties. If the value of the building as a rental property outstrips the value of the property as a condo property, a landlord might make each owner in the property an offer (which is typically far above market prices) to get the owner to sell. Typically, the landlord needs only a certain percentage of owners to say yes to force all owners to sell, usually around 75 percent.\n\nSome 20 years ago, many apartment buildings were turned \u201ccondo\u201d by developers who sought to profit from a skyrocketing condo market. In strong real estate markets, you probably won\u2019t see condominium de-conversions. That is because the rising prices of condominiums makes the de-conversion process too expensive for rental building owners.\n\nThe law firm that represented all of the owners has a duty to you to represent those owners fairly and diligently. You were not an owner but a tenant in a unit sold by one of those owners. The law firm probably does not have any duty to you in their representation of the owner who sold the unit.\n\nYour lease governs your relationship with the old owner and the new owner. We presume that your lease states that you put down an amount as security deposit under the lease. We also assume that the buyer would want proof that the security deposit was returned to you at or before the closing. Now, you say that you never got your security deposit back. Between you and your new landlord, your lease would still provide for the deposit of a security deposit.\n\nUnlike some commercial leases, we think that the new landlord probably has assumed the duties of the old landlord and has the continued obligation to return to you the security deposit to you. Have you contacted the new landlord to tell them that you never received the security deposit? The new landlord would probably have wanted to see a document signed by you acknowledging the return of the security deposit. You didn\u2019t sign it, as you didn\u2019t get the money back, so if the new landlord received a signed document, the question to ask is, who signed that document on your behalf?\n\n[More Matters: Reading the tea leaves in the real estate market]\n\nYou mentioned that your state law requires interest to be paid on your security deposit. Some municipalities have ordinances that are protective of tenants and require landlords to return the security deposit to tenants within a certain number of days following the end of the lease. Those same ordinances also might require landlords to pay interest on the security deposit. In many cases, those ordinances penalize landlords for their failure to pay interest or return security deposits as required under the ordinances.\n\nThose penalties can be severe. In Chicago and some of its surrounding suburbs, the penalty can be up to double the amount of the security deposit as penalty. Those same ordinances frequently make the old landlord and the new landlord jointly liable for any violations under the ordinance for failure to return the security deposit or pay interest on the security deposit. Not only that, the tenant can recover attorneys\u2019 fees in any action against the landlord.\n\nWe suggest that you talk to your new landlord and see what they know after you explain to them that you never received a return of the security deposit. By the way, you should probably communicate with your old landlord and new landlord in writing to keep a record of the conversations. Interest on your security deposit is probably due on an annual basis on the anniversary of your lease.\n\nWhile some landlords may try to wiggle their way out of paying you, others will understand and make sure they paper their file showing you got paid the interest you were owed and the entire amount of the security deposit. We'd expect your new landlord to simply send you a check for the interest and security deposit you're owed rather than face problems down the line. The new landlord can seek what they can from your old landlord under the documents that they signed at their sale.\n\nAnd remember, if your municipality or state does not have a law or ordinance regulating security deposits or interest on security deposits, you may have only the remedies set forth under your lease. That remedy may be to sue for your security deposit and nothing more, and you may not have the right to get your attorneys\u2019 fees.
