The foot race was on, with men in black in full pursuit of a receiver who would not be denied.\n\nThere was far too much at stake for Beckham to falter now. Too many critics to quiet. Too much wide-open space for him not to score.\n\nFueled by the big stage, the bright lights of prime time, and the foolish verbal jabs of a man he believes altered the course of his career, the Cleveland Browns star accelerated his stride, churned more grass beneath his feet and trotted into the end zone for the longest reception of his NFL career \u2014 and a figurative one-finger salute to Gregg Williams.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDays after the New York Jets defensive coordinator questioned whether Beckham was \u201cone of the most dynamic players in the league,\u201d the receiver put on a show in his return to MetLife Stadium, his former home the past five seasons with the New York Giants. With an impressive one-handed grab over a Jets defender and an 89-yard score to cap the 23-3 Browns\u2019 victory on Monday Night Football, Beckham left no doubt that he\u2019s still an impact player.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nBy the time the dust settled on this lopsided affair, the star receiver purposely remained composed as he addressed reporters, preferring to take the high road when questioned repeatedly about Williams and the Giants\u2019 fateful decision to trade him to Cleveland this past offseason.\n\nBut Beckham\u2019s best friend and teammate knew better.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrowns receiver Jarvis Landry told Yahoo Sports that Beckham was \u201cvery much\u201d pissed off by Williams\u2019 comments, adding: \u201cI was on the field pointing at Gregg Williams like, \u2018You see him, bruh? He says you\u2019re not the most dynamic player in the NFL.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOdell Beckham runs off the field after defeating the New York Jets. (Getty Images)\n\nThis game was foremost about securing their first win of the season. But, for Beckham, it also was about exorcising old demons.\n\nAnd silencing Williams.\n\n\u201cHe acted like it didn\u2019t faze him,\u201d Landry said during a quiet moment in the visitors locker room. \u201cBut I think making that play. That moment. Being back. Being here \u2014 it was special. He\u2019s one of the best receivers in the NFL. You give him that much space, put the ball in his hands, great things are going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe Jets were manhandled by defensive end Myles Garrett (three sacks) and the rest of the Browns defense. They lost their backup quarterback, Trevor Siemian, who started in place of Sam Darnold who is sidelined several weeks because of mononucleosis. And the Jets\u2019 so-called offensive guru, head coach Adam Gase, is being fairly criticized for his pedestrian game plan and the team's 0-2 record.\n\nBut it was Beckham who was the story of the evening, catching six passes for 161 yards against Williams\u2019 aggressive defense less than a week after he blasted the Browns\u2019 former defensive coordinator and interim head coach for targeting him in the past, resulting in an ankle injury that changed \u201cmy life forever.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, however, Beckham got the last word.\n\nThe receiver \u2014 who donned a $2 million Richard Mille watch \u2014 refused to fan the flames of his verbal war with Williams. There was no need to.\n\nBeckham\u2019s one-handed, 33-yard snag down the far sideline was reminiscent of The Catch that made him an NFL and social media star his rookie season. And his touchdown catch on a beautiful Baker Mayfield ball succinctly answered the question, \u201cOdell who?\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that it was going to be a big play,\u201d said Beckham, whose 89-yard catch-and-run score was aided by his quick feet and woeful coverage by the Jets secondary. \u201cI saw the safety [Marcus] Maye. As I caught it, he knew I was taking an angle to the right. I saw him duck his head down and I just made a cut, and I knew I was out of there if my hamstrings held up.\u201d\n\nHis legs would not betray him though. And when he crossed the goal line for his first touchdown in a Browns uniform, Beckham delivered a clear message to the MetLife Stadium crowd as well.\n\n\u201cHe took the keys out, like, \u2018I\u2019m back home\u2019 and then opened the door,\u201d Landry said, describing Beckham\u2019s end zone celebration. \u201cAll of that is a special moment for him.\u201d\n\nSaid Garrett, who became the fifth-youngest player in NFL history to record a three-sack game on Monday Night Football: \u201cHe\u2019s so dynamic. He can do it all.\u201d\n\nObviously, Willams felt otherwise.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why Landry pointed in Williams\u2019 direction on the Browns\u2019 second-to-last drive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he did or he didn\u2019t [see me], but I hope he did,\u201d Landry said. \u201cLike, you don\u2019t talk s- - - to players like that. That\u2019s too much. That\u2019s more motivation. You don\u2019t do that s - - -. And then you don\u2019t disrespect somebody like that.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled as he shook his head.\n\n\u201cWhy are you even talking about this man like this anyway?\u201d\n\nIn the end, Beckham got the win. And the last word.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In his return to New York, Odell Beckham Jr. shows his old coach that, in fact, he is still one of the most dynamic players in the NFL.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IaB3bMPTtbTgtTETsyboKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODUuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QyHvpKvu6qJnU2xMvsJaVA--~B/aD0yODQ1O3c9NDExNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d88f6730-d918-11e9-bef9-69ccb1951571", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
