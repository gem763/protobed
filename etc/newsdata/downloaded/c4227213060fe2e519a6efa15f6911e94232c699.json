Representatives from PragerU were at various stops to speak with reporters and those interested in learning more about YouTube\u2019s restriction of PragerU\u2019s content.\n\nPragerU Chief Marketing Officer Craig Strazzeri told PJMedia in a recent statement: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that our videos are educational and appropriate for young people. All young people should be watching our videos. We do hope that lots of people will be given the chance to see our videos\u201d as the truck drives through Silicon Valley. Strazzeri added: \u201cAs much as we need to win legally in the courtroom we also need to win publicly, The goal of this is to win in the court of public opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mainstream media has completely ignored the issue of Big Tech censorship of conservative voices,\u201d said Strazzeri. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going on this road trip Thursday, to spread public awareness on the issue so Americans know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nCurrently, PragerU has two lawsuits against Google and its YouTube subsidiary. In Seattle in August, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard the federal case and has yet to come to a decision on the ruling. PragerU filed another lawsuit specifically in California earlier this year, and under California law, PragerU can add causes of action such as breach of contract and consumer fraud to its lawsuit.\n\nPhotos of Prager U\u2019s video truck can be seen below:\n\nWe\u2019re currently driving through San Francisco on our way to the Silicon Valley with a truck that is playing our restricted videos!
