More than 75% of Beyond Meat's shares outstanding weren't tradable until Tuesday, establishing the period's expiration as a date-to-watch for analysts, investors, and company officials.\n\nThe plant-based-food company also issued an optimistic third-quarter earnings report Monday afternoon, beating Wall Street's profit expectations and raising guidance for full-year revenue. CEO Ethan Brown forecasted continued collaboration with McDonald's, praised new C-suite hires, and assured investors that grocery sales were not threatened by new competition in the meatless-meat sector.\n\nYet Beyond Meat lost nearly 25% of its market value once markets opened Tuesday as the company's lockup expiration brought new downward pressures to the share price.\n\n\"Despite coming off its highs, valuations still look remarkably steep and now will be seen by many pre-IPO investors as the time to cash out,\" Markets.com chief analyst Neil Wilson said.\n\nThe stock closed Monday afternoon more than 320% higher than its IPO price. Whether early buyers wanted to lock in their profits or were spooked by the pre-market sell-off, the earnings report's positive news was dwarfed by immense profit-taking.\n\nThe sell-0ff wasn't a complete surprise for Beyond Meat's leadership. The lockup expiration may worry long-term investors, but it's a necessary process for many young companies, executive chairman Seth Goldman said in a call with analysts.\n\n\"While we recognize short-term reactions to these milestones are often marked by heightened uncertainty, we believe that Beyond Meat is in a stronger position today than at any other time in its history,\" Goldman said. \"We sincerely thank our pre-IPO investors for getting us to this point and for their long-term commitment and belief in our company.\"\n\nOther examples of post-lockup wreckage\n\nBeyond Meat is only the latest company to face this technical-factor tumble. Shares of Pinterest fell as much as 5.1% when its lockup period expired on October 15. Zoom Video fell as much as 4% when its lockup ended the same day. Both companies pared their losses for the day by market close.\n\nUber's lockup expiration arrives November 6, two days after it reports its third-quarter figures. The rideshare company's stock sits about 28% below its IPO price, and it remains to be seen how many early investors will want to realize their losses and sell shares when the lockup ends.\n\nBeyond Meat traded at $85.56 per share at 12:05 p.m. ET, up about 31% year-to-date.\n\nThe company has two \"buy\" ratings, eight \"hold\" ratings, and three \"sell\" ratings from analysts, with a consensus price target of $114.82, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nSaudi Aramco cements status as world's most profitable company after earning $68 billion in just 9 months\n\nHarry Potter is getting dragged into the US-China trade war\n\nThe cofounder of legendary VC firm Andreessen Horowitz on what almost killed Uber, what really led to WeWork's downfall, and what happened after he passed on Airbnb", "description": "Beyond Meat's lockup period expired Tuesday, and the subsequent sell-off serves as the latest reminder that technical factors can overshadow promising per...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5db847a2dee01941db388d22-1920/beyond-meat-fake-meat-burger.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
