(AP) - Bills coach Sean McDermott pointed to an incompletion, of all things, as a sign of quarterback Josh Allen\u2019s continuing development entering his second season.\n\nRather than force a pass into coverage and risk a turnover with the Bills already in field-goal position, Allen earned McDermott\u2019s praise for throwing the ball away on third-and-goal from the 3 halfway through the fourth quarter Sunday.\n\nAn even bigger payoff came when Buffalo got the ball back after Giants defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence was flagged for unnecessary roughness against long-snapper Reid Ferguson during the field-goal attempt. One play later, Frank Gore scored from the 1 to seal a 28-14 win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s understanding the game a little better within the game, and what he can and can\u2019t do,\u201d McDermott said Monday, a day after the Bills improved to 2-0. \u201cI think that in and of itself is a step.\u201d\n\nOr as offensive coordinator Brian Daboll put it: \u201cAn incompletion rarely loses you games.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t in this case for Allen, who is showing he\u2019s capable of learning from past mistakes.\n\nAllen went 19 of 30 for 253 yards with a touchdown passing and another rushing in producing just his fifth turnover-free outing in 13 starts. And it came on the heels of Allen turning the ball over four times (two interceptions and two lost fumbles) in the first half of a 17-16 win over the New York Jets in the very same stadium.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a competitor that sometimes he doesn\u2019t want the play to end,\u201d Daboll said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working on that because he is strong, he is competitive and you\u2019d have to ask him this, but there\u2019s probably a play that he doesn\u2019t feel he can\u2019t make with his athletic ability,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that\u2019s an encouraging sign of him just playing the game the right way for us to help our team.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nA new-look offense\u2019s ability to produce lengthy drives. All six of Buffalo\u2019s touchdown drives this season have covered 74 or more yards.\n\nThey included a seven-play, 98-yard drive capped by Isaiah McKenzie\u2019s 14-yard touchdown reception to put Buffalo up 21-7 over the Giants. The drive matched Buffalo\u2019s longest in 10 years, and the Bills actually gained 108 yards overcoming a holding penalty against center Mitch Morse.\n\nLast season, the Bills didn\u2019t have six drives of 70-plus yards until their 10th game.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nInconsistencies in stopping the run. After limiting the Le\u2019Veon Bell-led New York Jets to 68 yards rushing, Buffalo gave up 129 to the Saquon Barkley-led Giants. Barkley gained 55 yards on four carries on an opening drive he capped with a 27-yard TD run.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nBackup defensive tackle Harrison Phillips, who was credited with a half-sack and three tackles in 28 snaps, one short of starter Star Lotulelei.\n\n\u201cHe got a little bit more volume in his job and rushed the passer better than he\u2019s rushed before,\u201d McDermott said of Phillips.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nCornerback Tre\u2019Davious White. He whiffed in driving to the line and attempting to stop Barkley on his 27-yard touchdown run. White was also beaten in coverage twice on the Giants\u2019 12-play, 76-yard drive that ended with T.J. Jones 4-yard touchdown catch to cut Buffalo\u2019s lead to 21-14 with 12 minutes left.\n\nINJURED\n\nRookie running back Devin Singletary is still being evaluated after hurting his left leg during a 4-yard run with under five minutes left. The backup to veteran Frank Gore had 57 yards rushing and scored his first career touchdown. Buffalo\u2019s depth is already thin at the position, with Gore, T.J. Yeldon and fullback Patrick DiMarco the only running backs on the roster. \u2026 McDermott would only say starting cornerback Taron Johnson (hamstring) and receiver/kickoff returner Andre Roberts (quadriceps) are progressing after both didn\u2019t play Sunday. \u2026 McDermott is looking for tight end Tyler Kroft to build on a good week of practice before determining whether he can face Cincinnati, his former team, on Sunday. Signed in free agency, Kroft has been out since breaking his right foot in May.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n9 - Bills have scored nine touchdowns on their past nine drives entering the red zone going back to last season\u2019s finale.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Bills have a chance to open 3-0 for just the third time in 26 years in their home opener against the Bengals on Sunday. The Bengals were completely dominated in a 41-17 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Buffalo is 1-1 in home openers under McDermott.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bills coach Sean McDermott pointed to an incompletion, of all things, as a sign of quarterback Josh Allen's continuing development entering his second season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/bills_giants_football_38458_c0-131-3138-1960_s1770x1032.jpg?4d9ba02d696100b4c7f4712464f78d5563a0e00a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
