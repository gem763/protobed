He was later taken to a hospital in Pietermaritzburg where he underwent surgery for his injuries.\n\nReports said the couple\u2019s toddler was unharmed during the horrific incident.\n\nThe young mother\u2019s brother, Ian Crouch, told News24 that he was able to speak to the husband after he came out of surgery.\n\nHe commented:\n\nHis recollection was that he was woken up by being stabbed in the stomach. There was a guy on his side of the bed stabbing him in the stomach and the other chap was stabbing my sister. He said he did manage to sort of grab the guy and there was a bit of a tussle down the stairs. After that, he doesn\u2019t have any recollection.\n\n\u201cThe motive behind the murder is currently not known. The crime in South Africa is spiraling out of control with a shocking 21,000 murders and 45,000 rapes reported in 2018,\u201d reports said.\n\nHowever, Crouch told news outlets on Friday that he arrived at the resort before the police on the day of the tragedy and claimed he heard a woman telling resort employees to blame the murder on a domestic dispute.\n\n\u201cI saw the staff from the resort all gathered together. A woman was talking and said she had been told by \u2018Vuyani\u2019 to say there was no staff at the resort after 11pm and no staff before 7am,\u201d he recalled. \u201cShe said she had been told there was a party at the chalet and there had been a domestic dispute.\u201d\n\nVuyani Dayimani is the CEO of the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency (ECPTA) and has since denied giving any instructions to the resort\u2019s employees regarding the incident.\n\nResort staff allegedly told authorities that people in a neighboring chalet said they heard a \u201ccommotion\u201d just before the event took place.\n\nHowever, police captain Dineo Koena said the deceased woman\u2019s husband \u201cis the only person who will lead us to who did this.\u201d\n\nReports said that although no arrests have yet been made, the investigation into the death of the mother and her unborn baby are currently underway.", "description": "A pregnant mother was reportedly stabbed to death as she slept near her family while on vacation at a resort in South Africa on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/karen-turner-fb-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
