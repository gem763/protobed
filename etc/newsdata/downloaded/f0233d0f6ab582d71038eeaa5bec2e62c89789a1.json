Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nRob Gronkowski started his new job by sparking some more speculation about his old one.\n\nIn his first appearance Thursday night as an analyst for FOX Sports, the former New England Patriots tight end reiterated he would be open to a potential return to the field at some point.\n\n\"I would have to be feeling it, feeling it big time to come back,\" Gronkowski said. \"It's always going to be open in my mind. I love the game of football. I love playing the game, I love being around the game, I even love watching the game of football now.\"\n\n\"I'll always keep it open. I'll always keep the door open.\"\n\nGronkowski retired from the NFL in March and has since partnered with a cannabidiol company. In August, he said he would consider a return to the NFL, but not in \"the foreseeable future,\" noting that he was \"losing that joy in life\" after his nine-year career.\n\nPatriots owner Robert Kraft said earlier in the day he was hoping the four-time all-pro would have change of heart.\n\n\"We all love Gronk and I think the bottom line is he hasn't put his retirement papers in,\" Kraft said on NFL Network. \"So we can always pray and hope. ... That's a good academic argument that there is hope for us still with Gronk.\"\n\nThe Patriots, for their part, could use at tight end. As New England entered Thursday night's game against the New York Giants, no tight end on the roster had more than four catches or 100 yards through the team's first five contests.\n\n\u201cThose guys, they\u2019re competing hard. I think they\u2019re trying,\" Tom Brady said of the team's tight ends this week. \"Matt (LaCosse) hasn\u2019t been out there as much as we all would have wanted \u2014 certainly what he would have wanted. Ryan (Izzo has) done quite a few things for us. We\u2019re just trying to get out there and utilize the reps we can in practice, talk about things, communicate through the things that come up in practice so that we can execute when we get into the game.\u201d\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "Rob Gronkowski is keeping Patriots fans' hope for a return alive, saying he would always consider a possible comeback in the NFL.", "authors": ["Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published P.M.
