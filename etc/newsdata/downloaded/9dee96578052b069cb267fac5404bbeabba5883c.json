Around 75 per cent of those stores are Softlines.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this trend, according to the report. \"Softlines spending has deteriorated as retailers struggle to lap a tax reform-driven step-up in 2018 discretionary spending.\" In addition, there have been \"powerful changes\" in purchasing habits in this category, including the growing popularity of the online luxury-goods consignment shop The RealReal Inc, the rental space with players like Rent the Runway Inc, and a \"continued push towards all things digital\" seen at the Revolve Group Inc. The result is added pressure to already-challenged traffic trends at \"over-stored\" brick and mortar retailers.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nWith these trends in play, the analysts said they believed it would be \"increasingly tough for Softlines retailers to justify keeping underperforming stores open, and wouldn't be surprised to see another large-scale round of closure announcements in early 2020.\"\n\nSome mall-based names most at risk for larger scale closure announcements include Macy's Inc, JC Penney Company Inc, Gap Inc and L Brands Inc's Victoria's Secret, the report said. Binetti rates Gap, L Brands and Macy's neutral, and has an underweight rating on JC Penney.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Consumer - [NEW YORK] US retail store closures in 2020 are at risk to be just as bad -- or even worse -- than 2019, according to a Credit Suisse report. .
