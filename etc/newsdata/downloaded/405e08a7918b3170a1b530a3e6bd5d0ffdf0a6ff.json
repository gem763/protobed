I'd have to see how the land lay at that moment.\n\n'What I don't want to be is just a personality in politics. We have gone too far down that rabbit hole.\n\n'If I stand it has to be not just because people trust me, people do trust me, it isn't just because people feel connected with that. That's not enough, it has to be about having a genuine plan for the future for our country.\n\n'At that time, I would make that assessment about whether I was the best thing for the future of the country.'\n\nREBECCA LONG-BAILEY, 40, MP for Salford and Eccles Rebecca Long-Bailey Elected in 2015, she was an early supporter of Jeremy Corbyn Once cruelly nicknamed as 'Rebecca Wrong Daily' after robotic media performances Her trade unionist father was a Salford docker, unloading oil from tankers at a Shell refinery Her first job was in a pawnbroker in Ellesmere Port where she says she learned the 'struggles of life' She studied to be a solicitor and is married with one child John McDonnell has praised her 'convincing commonsense answers'.\n\nJESS PHILLIPS, 38, MP for Birmingham Yardley Jess Phillips Elected in 2015, she nominated Yvette Cooper for leader Has four tattoos, including the Chinese symbol for courage She left the Labour Party when Tony Blair was in charge Before becoming an MP, she worked for Women's Aid managing refuges for domestic abuse victims Married with two children She once threatened Mr Corbyn, saying: 'The day... you are hurting us more than you are helping us, I won't knife you in the back, I'll knife you in the front'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Rebecca Long-Bailey piled pressure on Jeremy Corbyn as she suggested he should go if Labour loses at the next election.
