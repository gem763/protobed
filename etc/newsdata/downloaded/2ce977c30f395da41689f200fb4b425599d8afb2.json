They contain several alternative but specific kinds of terrorist activity that are very likely to endanger life.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that when \u200cGolaszewski\u200c was arrested by armed police in Leeds in February, he asked officers what was \u201cgoing on\u201d and added: \u201cHow\u200c \u200ccan\u200c \u200cI\u200c \u200cbe\u200c \u200ca\u200c \u200cterrorist?\u200c \u200cI\u2019m\u200c \u200cPolish\u200c \u200cand\u200c \u200cI\u200c \u200chave\u200c \u200cno\u200c \u200ccriminal\u200c \u200crecord.\u201d\u200c \u200c\n\n\u200cGolaszewski\u200c told the jury he was not racist and merely had legitimate concerns over immigration.\n\nThe court heard he had taken screenshots of Britain First\u2019s Facebook page, researched Ukip and made repeated visits to a website called the European Knights Project, which contains racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories about \u201cWestern civilisation\u201d.\n\n\u200cGolaszewski\u200c, who is Polish but has lived in Britain for 10 years, had also been photographed with far-right Polish politician Janusz Korwin-Mikke in Doncaster.\n\nThe former MEP was repeatedly fined by the European Parliament for racist comments, and was suspended after giving a Nazi salute in 2015, then again for describing migrants as \u201chuman garbage\u201d.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, the head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said the manuals Golaszewski collected were \u201cdeeply concerning, particularly in light of his support for right-wing causes and his racist, anti-Muslim and anti-immigration views\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe jury felt there was no reasonable excuse for Golaszewski to seek out and retain detailed information about how to kill people, step-by-step instructions for making high-grade explosives and guerrilla warfare techniques,\u201d he added.\n\n\u200cGolaszewski, of Wensleydale\u200c \u200cMews in \u200cArmely,\u200c was ordered to notify police of his location for 10 years after his release from prison.\n\nHe was one of three far-right extremists being sentenced at courts in London and Leeds on Friday, after the head of UK counter-terror police warned that right-wing terrorism was their \u201cfastest-growing problem\u201d.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Neil Basu said that children as young as 14 had been investigated over neo-Nazi beliefs, amid a rise in sophisticated online propaganda.\n\n\u201cAnywhere along this spectrum, people who are vulnerable to it can adopt part of that ideology to move into a terrorist act,\u201d he warned.", "description": "A private investigator with far-right views has been jailed for more than two years for collecting bomb and murder manuals.
