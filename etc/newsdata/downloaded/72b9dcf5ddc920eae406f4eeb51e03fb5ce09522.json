In July, both a Judiciary subpoena memo and a request in federal court for grand jury materials stated that the Judiciary Committee is working to determine whether it should \u201crecommend articles of impeachment\u201d against the president. As it has been widely reported, one of the benefits of this language is that it improves the committee\u2019s legal standing to obtain evidence it\u2019s seeking in its legal battles with the Trump administration. But the process Nadler has described is not just a legal strategy. The impeachment process, whether House Democrats know and acknowledge it or not, is happening right now.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s happening despite protests from Judiciary Committee Republicans, who routinely complain that the course Nadler has set out is illegitimate. \u201cThe Judiciary Committee became a giant Instagram filter,\u201d Republican ranking member Doug Collins declared in his opening remarks for Thursday\u2019s session. \u201cThe difference between formal impeachment proceedings and what we\u2019re doing today is a world apart no matter what the chairman just said. What we\u2019re looking at here is a filter to make you believe something!\u201d He later asked whether he\u2019d \u201cmissed a vote\u201d of the full House officially authorizing an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Constitution offers no guidelines whatsoever as to how the House pursues an impeachment process.\n\nThe Constitution offers no guidelines whatsoever as to how the House pursues an impeachment process, beyond noting that impeachment must begin in the House. Historically, every time the House has initiated the impeachment process, it has gone about it differently. Under Andrew Johnson, the House approved impeachment before articles had even been drafted. After they had been written, the House voted again to approve them and send them to the Senate. Under Richard Nixon, the House voted to authorize a Judiciary investigation and then drafted and approved articles of impeachment. Nixon resigned before things went further. Under Bill Clinton, the House passed a resolution authorizing the Judiciary Committee to conduct an impeachment investigation, but the committee did little to actively probe the revelations of the already released Starr Report. Later, a separate resolution with articles of impeachment was passed by the House.\n\nNow, Nadler\u2019s committee is conducting an investigation that may lead to the drafting of articles upon which the whole House will subsequently vote. Of these varied approaches to impeachment, there are none that can be said to be more constitutionally legitimate than the others. The Constitution does not even require a formal process of any kind to precede the drafting of articles. In fact, articles of impeachment against Trump have already been drafted and voted on multiple times since 2017. Had the House approved them, they would have been sent to the Senate for an impeachment trial\u2014simple as that.\n\nAnd yet an idea seems to persist that there is something like an official impeachment process which Democrats have yet to begin, and can only begin with the assent of the whole House. No such process exists. An impeachment happens when the House votes to approve articles of impeachment. The Judiciary committee is on the path to drafting those articles. The official impeachment process supporters are waiting for is the process that is taking place. Democrats are already impeaching Trump\u2014and they\u2019re already making a hash of it.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an open question whether the mixed messaging from Democratic leadership about impeachment is the product of genuine confusion about procedure and what Nadler is trying to accomplish, or if it is an intentional effort by leadership to muddy the waters\u2014allowing both impeachment supporters and impeachment opponents within the caucus to believe what they want to believe about what is taking place while Judiciary diligently continues with its investigation and public support for impeachment trickles upward.\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, Democratic leaders have outsmarted themselves. In the first place, a lack of clarity on what Judiciary is up to could undermine Nadler\u2019s strategy of using the imprimatur of an impeachment investigation to win its battles for evidence in court. In an interview with Bloomberg this week, Michael Conway, the Judiciary Committee counsel during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said that Steny Hoyer\u2019s initial denial Wednesday that an impeachment investigation was underway would have been \u201clegal malpractice.\u201d The continued efforts of pressure groups like Need to Impeach to nudge Democrats toward impeachment suggests that the status quo is still unsatisfying to party activists. Dueling statements about whether impeachment is or is not already happening will also undermine vulnerable red state Democrats who are wary of impeachment, by making them seem confused at best\u2014and duplicitous at worst\u2014to constituents who want to understand what\u2019s going on.\n\n\n\nA mealymouthed muddle will not inspire confidence in the case for Trump\u2019s impeachment among voters who could be convinced to support it. Instead, it could contribute to the impression that there is no there there\u2014that if there were a strong case against Trump, Democrats would be much less wishy-washy and ambivalent about the whole thing.\n\n\n\nNo matter how Democrats, individually or collectively, choose to frame the impeachment process, Republicans will continue to freely claim that the Democrats want impeachment to happen. Republicans, in fact, are just about the only group the current messaging works for. During Thursday\u2019s Judiciary Committee session, they took turns mocking Nadler\u2019s resolution and Democratic divisions while the committee\u2019s Democrats, as Bloomberg\u2019s Billy House tweeted, \u201csat mostly and weirdly quiet.\u201d \u201cThe strategy apparently,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis to not say anything that might inflame one side of their own party or another.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis strategy, if it can be called a strategy, is a slowly unfolding disaster. It\u2019s bad for impeachment supporters, bad for impeachment opponents, bad for liberals, bad for moderates, and bad for the country. It\u2019s bad even for Nancy Pelosi, who will continue to face questions from journalists about how the Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation should be characterized no matter how much those inquiries annoy her and no matter how inconvenient she believes them to be.\n\n\n\nIt is also bad for the country. For only the fourth time in American history, the House has begun a presidential impeachment. Our representatives owe the American people clarity about this process and its significance. If confusion persists\u2014if Democratic leadership continues to insist on this quantum superposition of political reality\u2014a large share of the voting public will glean only this: The Democratic Party, perhaps more literally than ever before, does not know what it is doing.\n\n", "description": "House Democrats have begun the process of impeaching Trump\u2014whether they admit it or not.", "authors": ["Osita Nwanevu"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2fef5c53089b21c356c8b0188b26d16e374aa94f.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
