If he agrees to appear, Bolton would be the highest-ranking official yet to testify before the committees.\n\nA lawyer for Bolton didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\n\nBolton represents a potentially devastating witness against Trump for his closeness to the president, centrality to the Ukraine issue, and longstanding conservative credentials that give him heft with a wide swath of Trump\u2019s GOP supporters in Congress.\n\n\u201cBolton is a hawk and he\u2019s a real right-winger, but I think he\u2019s a straight shooter\u201d\n\nOther witnesses have reportedly described Bolton as caustically dismissive of attempts to pressure Ukraine, slamming those efforts as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d cooked up by EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. He reportedly warned that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was \u201ca hand grenade\u201d threatening to blow up entire Trump administration.\n\nOther witnesses have cast Giuliani as a central player in a shadow campaign to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations of Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents \u2014 an allegation at the heart of the impeachment inquiry now raging in Washington, D.C.\n\nFamous for his hardcore right-wing foreign policy views, Bolton is often viewed as a neoconservative ideologue \u2014 but also as a man guided by his own set of principles, even by many of the same detractors who think his aggressive positions are outright dangerous.\n\n\u201cBolton is a hawk and he\u2019s a real right-winger, but I think he\u2019s a straight shooter,\u201d said Robert Deitz, who held top positions in George W. Bush\u2019s National Security Agency and CIA. \u201cI cannot imagine he will lie for this president.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether Bolton will actually show up. Bolton\u2019s former deputy at the National Security Council, Charles Kupperman, responded to his Congressional subpoena with a lawsuit that asked a judge to rule on whether he should testify or comply with a White House demand to refrain.\n\nRead: Trump's Already Freaking Out Over Today's Impeachment Testimony. This Week's Star Witness Hasn't Even Testified Yet\n\nA person familiar with Kupperman\u2019s thinking has told VICE News that Kupperman does not plan to testify on the Hill before the court has weighed in on the question.\n\nBolton played a key role in a July 10 meeting with top Ukrainian officials that has emerged as perhaps the most important set piece in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAt that meeting, Sondland raised the question of swapping a meeting with Trump in the White House for investigations, according to testimony by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was Trump\u2019s top Ukraine advisor in the White House. But Bolton abruptly shut that meeting down, Vindman said.\n\nVindman testified that he later confronted Sondland about Sondland\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments on investigations, and then spoke to a National Security Council lawyer \u2014 at a time when Bolton was heading the NSC.\n\nAnother witness, Trump\u2019s former top advisor on Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, has reportedly testified that Bolton advised her to speak with an NSC lawyer as well.\n\nCover: U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton speaks to the media after his meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, in Minsk, Belarus.
