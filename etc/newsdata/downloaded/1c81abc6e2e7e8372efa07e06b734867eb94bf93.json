Chicago has destroyed Washington primarily with crossing routes and has been able to convert 75% (6 of 8) of their third downs.\n\nThe Bears first got on the board with a pick-six from former Washington safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, who returned Keenum\u2019s pass 37 yards for a touchdown.\n\nWashington hit a 35-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
