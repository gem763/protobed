The targets included \"at least 100 human rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society across the world,\" according to Cathcart.\n\nThe malware was intended to conduct \"surveillance of specific WhatsApp users,\" the complaint said. Targets were located in places such as Mexico, the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Bahrain. NSO's clients include government agencies in those countries, as well as private entities, according to the complaint. The complaint, however, does not name any defendants aside from NSO Group and its parent company, Q Cyber Technologies.\n\nNSO Group said in a statement Wednesday that it disputes the allegations and \"will vigorously fight them.\"\n\n\"The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists,\" the company added.\n\nWhatsApp first acknowledged the attacks in mid-May, saying at the time that it had discovered and fixed the vulnerability exploited by the hackers. It asked users to update their apps to close the loophole.\n\nThe attack prompted WhatsApp to launch a months-long investigation, working with the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which volunteered to help the messaging platform identify cases where suspected targets of the attack were members of civil society.\n\nThe investigation revealed that attackers installed NSO's flagship spyware, known as Pegasus, on smartphones by making a WhatsApp call to victims, according to WhatsApp and Citizen Lab. The victims didn't even have to answer the call for their phones to be infected.\n\nCitizen Lab says that there are multiple ways the devices could be infected, and not all are known yet.\n\nOnce Pegasus was installed, it began contacting servers controlled by Pegasus operators and sending back the victim's private data. That data included passwords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages and live voice calls from popular mobile messaging apps, according to Citizen Lab, which published the findings of its research on its website Tuesday.\n\nAn operator could even turn on an infected smartphone's camera and microphone to capture activity happening near the phone, and use the GPS function to track a target's location and movements.\n\nWhatsApp chief Cathcart wrote that the attacks were \"highly sophisticated,\" but the attackers' attempts to cover their tracks weren't entirely successful.\n\nThey \"used servers and internet-hosting services that were previously associated with NSO. In addition ... we have tied certain WhatsApp accounts used during the attacks back to NSO,\" Cathcart said.\n\nCitizen Lab said that among the many companies it has tracked, \"NSO Group stands out in terms of the reckless abuse of its spyware by government clients.\"\n\nAlthough NSO's technology is marketed as a tool to assist governments in lawful investigations into crime and terrorism, Citizen Lab said it \"has identified dozens of cases where journalists, human rights activists and defenders, lawyers, international investigators, political opposition groups, and other members of civil society have been targeted with Pegasus.\"\n\nIn the statement issued by NSO Group, the company says its technology has helped save thousands of lives in recent years by aiding law enforcement, and respects all fundamental human rights.\n\n\"We consider any other use of our products than to prevent serious crime and terrorism a misuse, which is contractually prohibited. We take action if we detect any misuse,\" it said.\n\nWhatsApp and parent company Facebook are asking the court for damages of at least $75,000 plus attorneys' fees and any other damages to be proven at trial.\n\nThe companies are also asking for an injunction against NSO Group, which would bar the company and anyone affiliated with it from accessing WhatsApp or Facebook's services, which includes creating and maintaining accounts on the messaging and social media platforms.", "description": "WhatsApp is suing NSO Group, saying that the Israeli company was behind a cyberattack that installed spyware on users' phones and targeted at least 100 human rights defenders, journalists and civilians across the world.", "authors": ["Sherisse Pham", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191007082848-whatsapp-phone---stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
