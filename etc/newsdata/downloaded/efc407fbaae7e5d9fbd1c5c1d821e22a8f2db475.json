A handful of times a long time ago,\u201d he said. He added that he knows people whose lives have been \u201cshaken\u201d by its criminalization and the so-called \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d\n\nButtigieg said people still have an image of the marijuana industry and dispensaries that\u2019s based on outdated stereotypes.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into a place like this, it almost reminds you of an Apple store how tidy and carefully it\u2019s laid out, knowledgeable employees and a legitimate business that still struggles because federal policy hasn\u2019t caught up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mayor of South Bend, Indiana walked through the dispensary with the shop\u2019s owners and shook the hands of several employees.\n\nAs a pungent, herbal scent hung in the air and three workers nearby bundled and labeled pairs of joints, Buttigieg asked about the testing of products and difficulty of banking.\n\nNevada, which legalized marijuana in 2017, is among the states that\u2019s struggled to find a way to process pot business transactions. Most banks won\u2019t do business with the cash-heavy industry because the drug is still considered illegal by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThey have to do so much with cash that doesn\u2019t really make sense,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nHe said the criminalization of drugs, particularly marijuana, has failed. He said the U.S. also needs to expunge marijuana convictions, especially because they\u2019ve disproportionately affected minorities and ruined lives.\n\nThe mayor, a military veteran, said he\u2019s met a lot of other veterans who rely on cannabis for treating issues connected to their service like post-traumatic stress disorder. He said any \u201clegitimate medical use\u201d of cannabis should be covered by health insurance like any other therapy.\n\nButtigieg did not purchase any products at the shop, joking \u201cI\u2019m on the clock and it\u2019s going to be a long work day for me.\u201d", "description": "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Pete Buttigieg said he\u2019s used marijuana \u201ca handful of times a long time ago,\u201d and that it\u2019s time to legalize marijuana.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/GettyImages-1149616734-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
