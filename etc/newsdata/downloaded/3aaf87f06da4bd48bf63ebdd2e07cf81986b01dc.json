It forms the basis of a widening controversy that\u2019s sparked an impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\nRecently, Facebook said that it would not attempt to fact-check political ads \u2014 a position the company reasserted as the Biden campaign moved to have the spot taken down.\n\nIn a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Wylie \u2014 who blew the lid on the data scandal that walloped Facebook last year \u2014 insisted that the site was \u201cmaking a choice\u201d to spread false information. He compared the company to a \u201cstalker\u201d on a date.\n\n\u201cSo if one campaign is basing itself on a scaled spread of disinformation and fake news in its advertising campaign, and you say we're just not going to do anything about it, you are making a choice, whether you like it or not, to help one side,\u201d Wylie said to Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM.\n\nLike a bad blind date\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 19: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (L) and Facebook's Vice President of Global Public Policy, Joel Kaplan (R) chat after leaving a meeting with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) in his office on Capitol Hill on September 19, 2019 in Washington, DC.

He called for independent regulators who will speak for its users \u2014 something several politicians have called for in the wake of the Cambridge scandal.\n\nHe believes the Internet \u201cis part and parcel of democracy now\u201d \u2014 which begs the question of whether the rules need updating.\n\nWylie used an analogy of Facebook as a perfect blind date \u2014 only to find out that person has spent two years stalking the person they\u2019re courting.\n\n\u201cYou are more vulnerable, because there's an imbalance in power, because one entity, or one person, knows a lot more about you than vice versa,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cFacebook is like that stalker - and that's powerful... people will pay money to access the knowledge of that stalker,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrete Suarez is producer at Yahoo Finance for YFi PM and The Ticker.
