Last year, Brazilian officials said $16 million in undeclared cash and luxury watches that were seized from a delegation he led may have been part of an effort to launder money embezzled from the country's government. And a Paris court in 2017 convicted the son of embezzling millions of dollars in public money, although the case has been appealed.\n\nThe Geneva prosecutor's office in February cited rules allowing prosecutors to close cases in which the person under investigation had \"repaired the damage or done everything that could have been expected of him or her to make up for the wrong that was caused.\"\n\nThe investigation involved authorities in the United States, the Cayman Islands, France, Monaco, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Marshall Islands.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrank Jordans contributed to this report from Berlin.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
