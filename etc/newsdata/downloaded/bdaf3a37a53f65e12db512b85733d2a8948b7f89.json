While the lights, flowers and the general bonhomie that pervades this season is all good; the dry fruits, the plethora of mithai and the feasting that occurs in every home can lead one to gain several kilos. However, while putting on a few grams may be inevitable, here are ways to ensure that you do not bust your weighing scale!With all the goodies on offer during Diwali, it would require inhuman reserves of fortitude not to sample them. However, the key word here is \u201csample,\u201d not binge. Taste tiny portions so that your craving is fulfilled while it doesn\u2019t affect your calorie intake significantly. For instance, eat one-fourth of a laddoo, instead of the whole desi ghee sodden thing! For bigger meals that you cannot avoid, ask for a quarter plate to restrict your portions. Eating less of the sinful fare around you will help you. Tip: Never take a second helping.Avoid bingeing on sweets. This one is a no-brainer but over-indulgence in mithais is the number one reason why people gain a few kilos during Diwali. Stay away from calorie rich sweets at any cost! If you can\u2019t avoid them, opt for ones that use jaggery and dates to sweeten instead of sugar. Also remember that you need to go a little easy on the dry fruits as well because, although they are healthy, they are rich in calories. Eat mindfully instead of grabbing snacks on the go in the midst of all that Diwali chaos.You will tend to overindulge in sweets or fried food if you have missed a meal because your body will want to make up for the lost calories. So make sure that you are eating something healthy like buttermilk, fruit, or a few almonds every two hours so that you are never too hungry, especially before a calorie-rich meal.Don't tank up on the alcohol at Diwali card parties. Remember, drinking alcohol is like giving our bodies a dose of pure sugar. They are extremely high in calories; even a supposedly low-calorie drink like 45 ml of 80 percent proof vodka is almost 100 calories. If you cannot avoid drinking completely, sip on a glass of red wine. At least, you will get some antioxidant benefits with the calories. Avoid sweetened mixers with your drinks and stick to plain soda and fresh lime.Just because it is Diwali, it is no excuse to stop going to the gym. Make time for exercise so that your metabolism is at its optimum best. Working out, especially lifting weights, will keep burning those calories as you wolf down another unhealthy Diwali treat. Don\u2019t have time to go to the gym? Run around the neighbourhood or sprint up a few flights of stairs.", "description": "Don\u2019t let all the joy of Diwali go straight to your hips.
