All others in the city council chamber voted in favour of the motion.\n\nWhether the council faces Federal sanctions over today\u2019s move remains to be seen. The Morrison Government has previously waged war against local municipalities that pass similar motions, and vowed to pass and update legislation that would force city councils to hold citizenship ceremonies on January 26th. However those laws have not yet passed Federal Parliament.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government has stripped various local councils who previously passed similar motions of their right to host citizenship ceremonies. Notably, this has included major inner-Melbourne municipalities Yarra and Darebin.\n\nFor now though, the vote stands as a massive step forward in the relationship between Tasmanian legislators and First Nations people.\n\nState Government officials have not issued comment on today\u2019s vote.\n\nFuck yeah Tassie. Fuck yeah Launceston. Get around \u2019em.", "description": "City of Launceston councillors have voted nearly-unanimously in favour of moving official Australia Day celebrations away from January 26th.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/launceston.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
