Photo: Matthew Murphy\n\n\u2018They say all kinds of clich\u00e9s here, like \u2018what happens here stays here,\u2019\u201d Josh Henry sings early on in The Wrong Man. In the pop-hit-songwriting machine Ross Golan\u2019s concept album turned stage musical, directed by Thomas Kail of Hamilton and In The Heights fame, the same line could double as a TL;DR review of the show. Well \u2026 at least the first clause. They do say a lot of clich\u00e9s here, if here is the Newman Mills Theater, home to the story of an unjustly incarcerated man who was \u201cat the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d and who wants you to understand what it\u2019s like to be \u201cin my shoes,\u201d fighting an \u201ceye-for-an-eye\u201d justice system. What happens here, however, doesn\u2019t stay here \u2014 it gets reviewed on Vulture.\n\nThe wrong man himself is Duran, a middle-aged middle manager in Reno who fled a rough childhood in search of something better. Which, he\u2019d thought, was penny-pinching though life with his girlfriend and her two kids, until she left him heartbroken. It\u2019s the kind of sadness best cured by a bender in a local bar followed by a hookup with Mariana. Weeks later, Mariana tells Duran she\u2019s pregnant and advises him to skip town as her criminal ex-boyfriend is out for blood. Instead, the ex kills Mariana and a stranger, setting Duran up to take the fall for both murders. Duran is, as he reminds the audience with increasing desperation during his trial and his final days on death row, the wrong man. \u201cI did not shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die,\u201d he sings at one point, an eye-roller of a line around which it suddenly seemed possible the whole show was written.\n\nHenry imbues Duran with everything he\u2019s got: sweat, tears, and a powerhouse voice that brings down the house, song after song. The man could belt the phone book and make you feel things about it. But that formula gets tedious, and packing in so many eleven-o\u2019clock numbers diminishes their impact. Golan has written for Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Justin Bieber, among many others, and you can tell: He knows how to craft a big three-minute song that can punch through the smoke machines at an arena show or into your earbuds. But he doesn\u2019t do much of the modulation, the emotional slow-build and release, then backing off, then doing it again, that a full-length musical demands.\n\nThat kind of repetition, in fact, is the trap that the show falls into over and over. The dancers, masterfully choreographed by Travis Wall, often mirror the action onstage. When Mariana takes Duran home to her apartment, a duo of dancers simulate sex beside them. It\u2019s a nice effect the first time. Also nice: \u201cTake Off Your Clothes,\u201d the background music to Mariana and Duran\u2019s hookup, sung on stage into a stand microphone by another cast member. \u201cNo need to airbrush this body on covers of magazines, \u2019cause you\u2019re the sexiest lady this world has or ever will see\u201d is a perfect skewering of a body-positive, sex-positive pop anthem that wouldn\u2019t be out of place as a follow-up to Maroon 5\u2019s \u201cGirls Like You.\u201d Golan (of course) has written for Maroon 5, too.\n\nThat pop sensibility is, as they might say in Reno, a double-edged sword, because it brings us still more repetition. Lyrically, we hear a handful of lines ad nauseam: that \u201csome good people do bad things,\u201d that \u201cthe wrong man is singing this song,\u201d that line about all the clich\u00e9s in Reno. By the time Duran, moments from death, is singing about being the wrong man, we\u2019re still left wondering just who exactly Duran is. He is most certainly not the right man \u2014 that we know, believe me \u2014 but that\u2019s really the only thing we\u2019re sure of, making it hard to fully feel for Duran\u2019s plight, even with as much of his heart \u2014 seemingly all of it \u2014 Henry is pouring into his character.\n\nThe book, also by Golan, does the show no favors. A particular problem is the cheapo characterization of Mariana\u2019s ex, known only as The Man in Black, who eventually lands in jail, not for multiple homicides but for a parole violation. He\u2019s all smarm, and it\u2019s jolting in a show trying to shine a light on a broken legal system and the prison-industrial complex to hear solitary confinement reduced to a joke about \u201cpeace and quiet\u201d in a Latin-infused pop number, complete with rainbow lighting. The impulse to give us a foil is correct in a show where the material only gets darker and darker, but this doesn\u2019t land at all.\n\nThat said, some of those eleven o\u2019clock numbers do come through. Golan has written several powerful standalone songs for the show, enhanced by arrangements and orchestrations by Alex Lacamoire. (The show debuted originally as a concept album to positive reviews at SXSW earlier this year.) \u201cStay Positive,\u201d Duran\u2019s attempt to self-soothe while hiding out from the cops and realizing the likeliness of his fate is a particular standout. But taken collectivel,y The Wrong Man\u2019s songs can feel one-note. Literally in their repetitive patter \u2014 Golan\u2019s work is at its best in verses straight from Duran\u2019s stream of consciousness, like a line about Duran noticing Mariana\u2019s alphabetized DVD collection, a delightfully funny moment preceding the foreboding grim turn \u2014 but also in their narrow emotional bandwidth. As the clich\u00e9 goes, it\u2019s hard to invest fully in the forest when all you\u2019re shown are the trees.\n\nThe Wrong Man is at MCC through November 17.", "description": "Theater Review: The Pop Songwriter Ross Golan\u2019s \u2018The Wrong Man\u2019 Starring Josh Henry Opens at MCC Theater", "authors": ["Madison Malone Kircher"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/09/09-the-wrong-man.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
