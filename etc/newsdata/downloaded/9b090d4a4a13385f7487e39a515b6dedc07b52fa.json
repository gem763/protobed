The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YMZ19, +0.30% DJIA, +0.47% climbed 33 points, or 0.1%, at 26,218, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.80% ESZ19, +0.28% rose 0.1% to 2,915, while the Nasdaq-100 futures NQZ19, +0.43% COMP, +1.12% rose 0.2% at 7,672. The Friday labor report showed the slowest pace of jobs in four months, as businesses grew more cautious about hiring. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 150,000 increase. However, August and July reports were revised up by a combined 45,000. In a separate survey, the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, the lowest rate since December 1969.

The resilience seen in the September job report may raise hopes that the economy can avoid a recession.", "description": "U.S. stock-index futures Friday morning turned cautiously higher after a crucial reading on employment from the Labor Department showed that job creation in...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
