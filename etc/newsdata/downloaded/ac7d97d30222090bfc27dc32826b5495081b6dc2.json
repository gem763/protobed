In the UK, other dark sky reserves include Exmoor and the Brecon Beacons National Park.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The IDA recognition can only be received by places that have exceptionally starry skies and commit to preserve them.\n\nCranborne Chase\u2019s recognition came after 10 years of work.\n\n\u201cWe have taken meter readings of the darkness of the night sky for several years and we are hugely grateful to the Wessex Astronomical Society for their support. We must also thank Bob Mizon as we could not have achieved this without his help, or the support of the local authorities and parish councils and we look forward to working with them as we continue to improve our dark skies,\u201d said Nunn.\n\n\u201cAlthough huge amounts of work have already been done to achieve this status, we must continually improve our dark skies. Dark sky friendly schemes with schools, business, parishes and landowners are being developed and Wiltshire Council, which administers two-thirds of the area, has already agreed to upgrade its street lighting. This will make a significant contribution and will help us continually improve our dark sky quality. This is a requirement of the IDA to ensure we maintain our exclusive status.\u201d", "description": "Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which lies just a couple of hours outside of London, has become the first ever\u00a0international dark sky reserve of its kind.
