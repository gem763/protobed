Adam Schiff, D-Calif., immediately recuse himself from leading the Trump impeachment inquiry. There simply cannot be fair, impartial and legitimate impeachment proceedings with a known partisan and conspiracy theorist like Schiff at the helm of such a serious undertaking.\n\nAnd serious it is. In a democracy, we have free elections. Voters select their leaders \u2013 including the president of the United States. No self-respecting Americans should allow their constitutionally enshrined votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 election to be overturned by corrupt Deep State operatives and corrupt politicians \u2013 especially those with a documented history of lying.\n\nAfter all, it was Schiff who went on TV hundreds of times in the past few years spreading damaging propaganda and conspiracy theories about the president and his administration, accusing them of colluding with Russians to steal the 2016 election.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: PATHETIC TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS FALLING APART \u2013 WHAT ARE PELOSI AND DEMS AFRAID OF?\n\nSchiff insisted repeatedly there was ample evidence of such collusion, yet after a thorough 22-month special counsel investigation, no evidence was found \u2013 or charges brought \u2013 against the president or his associates for conspiracy.\n\nThat alone is enough to disqualify Schiff \u2013 an extreme partisan and Trump-hater \u2013 from the impeachment proceedings.\n\nStrike 1.\n\nAdd to it that Schiff recently lied about having any contact with the whistleblower, whose complaint filed with the intelligence community inspector general in August was the catalyst for the impeachment mess that's tearing our country apart.\n\nTurns out Schiff's office did consult \u2013 if not coach \u2013 the whistleblower on how to file his or her complaint with authorities, unbeknownst to Congress. Schiff then hid this information from the media when asked, earning him four Pinocchios by The Washington Post.\n\nStrike 2.\n\nThen there's Schiff's televised late-September spectacle before Congress with millions of Americans watching. He manufactured what was said during President Trump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Instead of reading directly from the official transcript the president swiftly released, Schiff literally made stuff up and acted out a parody.\n\nSomeone please inform the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee that attempting to nullify the votes of the 63 million Americans who elected the president isn't a comedy skit on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nIf the president said anything that rose to \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" during the controversial phone call, why didn't the liberal lawmaker just read verbatim from the transcript?\n\nIt's because there was no there. So Schiff lied and inserted his own opinions and embellishments, further eroding his credibility \u2013 something he vanquished during the #RussiaHoax.\n\nStrike 3.\n\nAnd then there's the California congressman's glaring hypocrisy. In 2017, he tweeted: \"Have concluded Sessions must step down. His testimony was misleading, his explanation not credible and an independent prosecutor is needed,\" referring to Trump's former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whom Schiff and other Democrats demanded recuse himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn the spirit of fairness, if an attorney general must recuse himself from an important investigation for allegedly misleading the public, why not Schiff for doing the same? Shouldn't he be living by the same standards he imposes on others?\n\nBut wait! There's more.\n\nAlso during the Russia probe into the 2016 election, Schiff, now-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and other Democrats demanded that former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., recuse himself for allegedly withholding information from committee members, conducting secret meetings with the White House and other actions.\n\nIn 2017, Pelosi issued a statement saying: \"Speaker Ryan must insist that Chairman Nunes at least recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation immediately. That leadership is long overdue.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAgain, Democratic and Republican members of Congress should hold Schiff to the same standard as Nunes. A failure to do so will further convince voters the entire impeachment inquiry is exactly what Trump says it is: a partisan witch hunt, warranting its termination.\n\nFrom what we've seen so far, there needs to be an intervention.
