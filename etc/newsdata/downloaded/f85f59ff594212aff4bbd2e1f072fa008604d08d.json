Of course it puts off tourists and anyone who can\u2019t see that should open their eyes.\u201d\n\nREAD: Tourism can do well despite visas - mininster\n\nShe said that in the past travel agents in China sold package tours to South Africa. The travel agent would then handle the visa applications for the whole party. They understood the procedure and it worked well.\n\nOnce the visa applications had to be made in person by each individual tourist at one of only two cities \"in the vast land of China\" they lost interest. It was easier to sell tours to other countries, said Myburgh.\n\n\u201cThe really sad part about this is that it was predictable and the Government was warned that it would happen. And so a big growth area in one of our most successful industries was choked off. Even if the visa regulations are changed, it will be very difficult to regain our share of the Chinese tourism market,\u201d said Myburgh.\n\nShe pointed out that the slump in Chinese tourism came before the requirement for unabridged birth certificates was introduced, so the cause could be narrowed down to the inconvenient and costly visa procedures.\n\n\u201cWe can expect the situation to worsen with the requirement for unabridged birth certificates,\u201d she added.\n\nALSO READ: Fewer foreign tourists in April", "description": "There is no point in blaming Ebola or the Chinese economy for the 38% drop in tourism from China, because SA brought this on itself, says a business chamber.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/295/0134d201490147049a35523d5a8233ac.jpg", "published_at": "2015-08-06"}
