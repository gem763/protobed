The short version is that it was essentially conceded by all that Hunter Biden had taken a position as director of a large Ukrainian gas company (Burisma) within days of his dad Vice President Joe getting appointed \u201cpoint man\u201d for U.S. diplomacy in that country; that Hunter did not have relevant business experience, and yet was paid $50,000 per month for the gig; that Joe had bragged (on a widely available video) of then using the leverage of threatening to withhold $1 billion of U.S. aid to get a prosecutor fired; and that the fired prosecutor had stated publicly that he was investigating Burisma. These are facts from which most reasonable people would easily conclude that something here stinks to high heaven. To reach that conclusion, the readily available facts are plenty of \u201cevidence\u201d; there is no need for any actual individual to step forward and admit that \u201cyes, we paid Hunter to buy influence with his dad.\u201d Of course that\u2019s why they paid Hunter that kind of money.\n\nSince the October 6 posts, facts keep coming out that, as far as I can see, only make the Bidens\u2019 position more and more indefensible. Simultaneously, organs of the progressive press keep doubling down on the narrative that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of wrongdoing of the Bidens in Ukraine, and any assertion to the contrary is a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nSuppose that you are one of those hard-to-sway skeptics who think that there is not yet enough evidence to demonstrate the crookedness of the Bidens. The funny thing is that there is a place you could go to really nail this down: Ukraine! Shouldn\u2019t somebody be doing that?\n\nLet me list some facts that have at least come to my attention since those prior posts:\n\nIt looks like the amounts paid by Burisma to Hunter Biden and his business colleague Devon Archer were not $50,000 per month each, but rather $83,333 per month each. Reuters has that figure in an October 18 piece here, confirming Peter Schweizer\u2019s assertion in this Fox News piece from September. $83,333 per month would come to a nice round $1 million per year.\n\nFrom the same Reuters piece, the Burisma board met all of two times per year. Reuters says that Hunter \u201cregularly attended\u201d (omitting how many meetings he actually went to), and then concedes that the meetings were held outside of Ukraine, and Hunter never actually went to Ukraine even once.\n\nSo what the heck was Hunter doing, if anything, to justify the mil per year? Hunter\u2019s lawyer, a guy named George Mesires, put out a statement on October 13 attempting to answer that question. The answer Mesires gives is, basically, \u201ccorporate governance advice.\u201d \u201cHunter focused his work on the principles of corporate transparency, governance and responsibility . . . .\u201d The statement gives no specifics as to what the advice might have been.\n\nBut wait a minute! Isn\u2019t Burisma a private company, without public shareholders, and essentially owned by one guy? (From Wikipedia: \u201c [Burisma] is owned by Mykola Zlochevsky . . . .\u201d). Since when do private companies owned by one guy have need for any kind of sophisticated or complex \u201ccorporate governance\u201d counseling? Completely private companies like this don\u2019t normally have outside directors at all. Why should they? And if for some reason they do need some corporate governance advice, why don\u2019t they get it from an outside lawyer, to whom you can pay a small fraction of $1 million per year even at outrageous big firm lawyer rates? (Sure enough, Burisma got along just fine without outside directors right up until its patron President Yanukovich fled the country and Joe Biden took over the role of \u201cpoint man\u201d for the U.S.)\n\nReuters, anticipating my objection, comes up with several supposed reasons why Burisma might possibly have had need of fancy corporate governance advice and sought same from Hunter. All of the reasons are attributed to anonymous \u201csources\u201d inside or \u201cclose to\u201d Burisma. \u201c\u2018Expansion to other markets was . . . discussed,\u2019 [one source stated]. Another source close to Burisma said Biden assisted with analysis of oil and gas assets the company was considering buying abroad, though a deal didn\u2019t go through. The company was considering possible acquisitions in Europe, Kazakhstan and the United States, the source and another person close to Burisma said. Both sources said that around the time Biden was appointed, Burisma was also looking to secure a financing deal with foreign investment funds, including one in the United States.\u201d Aha! So every single thing that Hunter did as to \u201ccorporate governance\u201d related to discussions of prospective deals, all revealed entirely by anonymous company sources, none having identified counterparties, and none of which went anywhere during the entire 5 years that Hunter served as a $1 mil per year director. Should anyone acknowledge that sources inside or \u201cclose to\u201d Burisma have a powerful incentive to rationalize the function that Hunter was serving here?\n\nNow, are these anonymous sources and Reuters playing it straight? Or is this just a preposterous cover story to try to justify the indefensible? The obvious facts that Burisma somehow didn\u2019t need \u201ccorporate governance\u201d advice before Yanukovich fled Ukraine and Joe Biden got involved for the U.S., and that no transaction calling for or requiring sophisticated corporate governance advice actually happened during the entire time of Hunter\u2019s directorship, should give you a strong clue as to the answer. But for doubters, there is also a way to get definitively to the bottom of this, and that is to investigate. If you were going to do that, here are some obvious places and questions that you would start with:\n\nHow does Burisma \u2014 a company wholly owned by the former Ukrainian \u201cEcology Minister\u201d and close associate of the then-President who was in turn a close ally of Vladimir Putin \u2014 come to hold a large percentage of the valuable oil and gas leases in that country?\n\nWhat do the minutes of the Burisma board meetings show as to Hunter Biden? Get them! This should tell you which meetings Hunter attended, what was discussed, and whether he said anything at all, let alone provided sophisticated advice.\n\nWhat language was used in the Burisma board meetings? Ukrainian? What is the language of the minutes? To the extent he attended, did Hunter even know what was going on?\n\nWhat is the evidence of Hunter\u2019s work justifying the $1 mil per year? Did he do specific projects for the board? Did he generate reports for the company? Get them!\n\nWas there any sort of real proposed international transaction or investment in Burisma that would have called for the supposed advice that Hunter gave, or is this all a complete charade? Who were the counterparties? How far did the discussions go?\n\nOne thing is immediately obvious about each of these issues: all or almost all of the relevant documents and witnesses are in Ukraine. In other words, if you want to take testimony or subpoena documents, you are going to need to go through a Ukrainian prosecutor.\n\nSo is anybody in the U.S. government allowed to ask that these obvious pieces of evidence of corruption be investigated? Somehow, it seems that the very act of posing that question is now an impeachable offense. Therefore, are the Bidens entitled to a total pass on this hopelessly corrupt conduct, by virtue of the very fact that Joe is running for President?\n\nMeanwhile, the forces of the progressive media march forward with the narrative that until all details of the Bidens\u2019 corruption have been confirmed, there is therefore \u201cno evidence\u201d of same, and even to mention the subject is to traffic in a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d In my October 6 post I quoted from an October 6 New York Times piece: \u201cPresident Trump ha[s] been hurling unfounded accusations about Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in Ukraine.\u201d The accusations are \u201cwild.\u201d \u201cThere is no evidence behind Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Mr. Biden intervened inappropriately with Ukraine to help his son.\u201d Here are a couple more (among many):\n\nFrom Jane Mayer in the New Yorker, October 4, headline \u201cThe Invention of the Conspiracy Theory on Biden and Ukraine\u201d: \u201cFor nearly two years, conservative operatives have been trying to weaponize the Ukraine-based story that has led Trump to the brink of impeachment.\u201d The story is \u201ca repeatedly discredited conspiracy theory involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nFrom USA Today, October 11: \u201c[The town of Vodiane, Ukraine] is ground zero for a central claim \u2013 one with no credible evidence \u2013 in a scandal that has engulfed the Trump administration in an impeachment inquiry: that former Vice President Joe Biden forced the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor in order to protect his son Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma's board.\u201d\n\nPreposterous.", "description": "* On October 6 I put up two posts calling the two Bidens, Joe and\r\n      Hunter, \u201cstone cold crooked.\u201d The basis for the label was a series of\r\n      factual assertions listed in the first of the posts, none of which\r\n      had received any meaningful refutation in any source I could find.\r\n\r\n    * Since the October 6 posts, facts keep coming out that, as far as I\r\n      can see, only make the Bidens\u2019 position more and more indefensible.\r\n\r\n    * Simultaneously, organs of the progressive press keep doubling down on\r\n      the narrative that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of wrongdoing of the Bidens\r\n      in Ukraine, and any assertion to the contrary is a \u201cconspiracy\r\n      theory.\u201d\r\n\r\n    * Let me list some facts that have at least come to my attention since\r\n      those prior posts. . . .\r\n\r\n    * One thing is immediately obvious about each of these issues: all or\r\n      almost all of the relevant documents and witnesses are in Ukraine.
