We had a great summer. It just didn\u2019t work out. People are in love and sometimes it doesn\u2019t work out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happened with us. The British public aren\u2019t stupid. They watched us for eight weeks. They\u2019d suss us out. I wear my heart on my sleeve and I\u2019m such a \u00adromantic person.\n\n\u201cI fall in love hard. I\u2019d struggle to go on a show and fake a relationship. It\u2019s harder to lie than tell the truth.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: ITV More\n\nJack also previously opened up about the pair\u2019s split, sharing his thoughts on why things ultimately didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\"If we had lived in Love Island forever, we\u2019d have been fine. We rushed it straight away, we moved in together,\u201d he said during his hunt for love on E4\u2019s Celebs Go Dating.\n\n\u201cI did want to, but I wish we had waited. I let her rush me a little bit. We had a genuine connection in there and I think anyone can see that.\"\n\nYou guys!\n\nLike this article?
