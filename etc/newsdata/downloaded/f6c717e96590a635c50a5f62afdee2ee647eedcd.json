We know that local support, through youth clubs or local charities, can be incredibly helpful \u2013 but this is something only a small number of young people are able to get.\u201d\n\nThomas added that it\u2019s \u201cfar better\u201d that young people are able to access help as early as possible, \u201crather than add to the numbers needing specialist support\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
