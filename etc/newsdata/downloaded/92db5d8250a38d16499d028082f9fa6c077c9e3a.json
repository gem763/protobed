He was also planning to ride on Elon Musk\u2019s Space X rocket.\n\nZozo, whose tagline is: \u201cBe unique. Be equal,\u201d said in a statement that, by becoming a subsidiary of Yahoo Japan, it will gain stability and a solid partner.\n\nSucceeding Maezawa at Zozo\u2019s helm is Kotaro Sawada, who joined the company about 10 years ago after working at Japanese telecommunications giant NTT Data Corp.\n\nHiroko Sato, analyst for Jeffries, said the deal looked good for both sides as Yahoo has a chance to gain more shoppers to its online retail services by acquiring Zozo, especially younger consumers.\n\nThe move is not without risks as it faces in Japan formidable competition from Rakuten, she said.\n\n\u201cOur initial impression is positive for both companies,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yahoo Japan Corp. is putting up a tender offer, estimated at 400 billion yen ($3.7 billion), for Zozo Inc., a Japanese online retailer started by a celebrity tycoon.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Yuri Kageyama"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/japan_yahoo_zozo_80493_c0-208-4986-3115_s1770x1032.jpg?0768d82f94f8ed789219d9a209c99b83ca3d228d", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
