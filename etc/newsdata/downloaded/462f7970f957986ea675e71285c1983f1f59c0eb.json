He faces up to 15 years in prison. Individuals and companies that work for foreign governments are required to register their activities with the Justice Department.\n\nProsecutors say Zuberi solicited money from foreign governments while promising to lobby U.S. government officials on their behalf. His work, which involved making campaign contributions, gave him access to high-level U.S. politicians, some of whom took actions that benefited Zuberi's clients. Prosecutors say Zuberi made dozens of illegal campaign contributions. Some of which he made using the names of other people, some were made by people whom Zuberi later reimbursed, and some were financed by foreign entities, all of which violate Federal Election Commission regulations\n\nFrom 2011 to 2017, Zuberi contributed more than $3 million to federal and state campaigns from both parties, according to court records.\n\nZuberi also accepted money from two foreign companies and promised to use the funds to contribute to political campaigns. Instead, prosecutors say, Zuberi pocketed the vast majority of the funds, about $1.1 million.\n\nIn relation to the foreign agent charge, prosecutors say Zuberi submitted false documents to hide his lobbying efforts for Sri Lanka and the millions of dollars he received from the country.\n\nIn 2014, Zuberi failed to report more than $5.65 million in income he received as part of his lobbying work. Prosecutors say Zuberi's tax evasion, which happened over the course of four years, resulted in at least $3.5 million in tax losses.\n\nCourt documents do not show which candidates received campaign contributions from Zuberi and which of those contributions were made illegally. Prosecutors also did not say where the $900,000 Zuberi donated to Trump's inaugural committee came from.\n\nBut FEC campaign finance filings show that Zuberi has donated to politicians from both sides of the aisle, including Trump, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/22/trump-clinton-obama-donor-charged-campaign-finance-violation/2450981001/", "description": "Imaad Shah Zuberi solicited money from foreigners, funneled some of the money to U.S. political campaigns and concealed his work as a foreign agent.", "authors": ["Kristine Phillips", "Published P.M.
