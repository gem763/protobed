Dasha Zhukova had asked me to be on its cover\u2014she was its new editor-in-chief\u2014and they flew me to New York to attend the launch party and write about the shows. (My dad came too.) Before that, I had been going to middle school in Oak Park, Illinois, and writing a fashion blog for over a year. I had thousands of daily readers, but these invites felt otherworldly to me and everyone I knew.\n\nWhen the Cut asked me to annotate a blog post from that season, I chose this one for the title alone: \u201cunless you follow derek blasberg on twitter and already read about my every move and outfit detail.\u201d According to my diary, Derek \u2014 then a fashion journalist and man-about-town \u2014 was tweeting about me all week without saying hi. This was my way of saying, I see you, Derek, and probably a reaction to being looked at, more generally. Until Fashion Week, I had not understood what it meant to be in the public eye.\n\nNo longer shielded by my computer screen, I found myself face-to-face with hundreds of people: fashion people, famous people, people who decide who gets to be famous and what the world will soon consider beautiful. There\u2019s a hierarchy at Fashion Week, but once you\u2019re through the door, you technically have access to anyone, and they have access to you. Anna Wintour was right there. (I was too scared.) Cathy Horyn was right there. (I was too scared.) Grace Coddington was right there, and when I did introduce myself, she said, \u201cI hear you\u2019re the competition!\u201d (I was too scared to know that this was a compliment.)\n\nIn my diary from that time, I freaked out at how nice my heroes were and how aggressive other people could be. Cindy Sherman said she loved my self-portraits, Hamish Bowles said he was \u201csimply addicted\u201d to my writing, and Tim Blanks called me \u201cthe Tavster.\u201d Other interactions are less heartwarming: \u201cThen a lady from Cosmofuckingpolitan wanted an interview and I said no and they got angry but whatever\u201d; \u201ca guy at Rag & Bone looked me dead in the eyes and said, \u2018Is that a boy or a girl?\u2019\u201d It was confusing to parse these extremes, to wonder who was the authority on my self-worth, and to try and remember that it was me.\n\nBetween events, my dad and I ate at greasy spoons and discussed the way my story was snowballing in headlines, from \u201cTween Blogger Attends Fashion Week\u201d to \u201cTween Blogger Sits Front Row at Fashion Week\u201d to \u201cFashion Establishment Mad That Bloggers Are Sitting Front Row,\u201d and then, finally, \u201cAll Legacy Media Likely to Be Replaced by Blogs Someday Soon.\u201d (The joke was on all of us; Instagram launched the following year.) It felt very clear to me that the people at Fashion Week were not necessarily the people who read my blog, and that if you share something that receives enough hype or attention, it will eventually travel all the way to an audience it\u2019s not really meant for, who won\u2019t like it all that much.\n\nWhenever I get middle-school-style insecure about some kind of high-pressure social situation now, as an adult, I remind myself that I\u2019ve already endured the anxiety-dream version: navigating famously icy professional spaces at the age when you\u2019re your least confident. Only now can I appreciate how potentially disastrous it could have been, and how welcoming people actually were. According to my diary, I cried at the LaGuardia terminal waiting to fly home, and asked my dad if I could buy a Harper\u2019s Bazaar in order to \u201cbring a piece of Fashion Week home with me.\u201d I take it, then, that it was worth cherishing.\n\nHere is a document from that time. Click on the small red numbers for my annotations.\n\nunless you follow derek blasberg on twitter and already read about my every move and outfit detail\n\nGUYS, guys. Can we talk about Charles Anastase? NO, NO WE CANNOT, because I will go nuts if I don\u2019t finish NY reviews first.\n\nSo, uh, I\u2019m in North Dakota right now? And kind of forgot about it? Coming back from NY was weird and I didn\u2019t want to travel AGAIN but we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere and it\u2019s very lovely and mind-clearing. We went to the Badlands yesterday and it was really beautiful. Still though, I\u2019m excited to come home and not have to do anything but normal homework and stuff. I\u2019m excited to clean my room, which is weird.\n\nBut anyways, outfits from Fashion Week \u2026\n\nGoing for \u201cold lady/Marc Jacobs-y\u201d. Photo: Amber De Vos/Patrick McMullan via Getty Image\n\nI wore this last Saturday? I think? Or five years ago? Or something? Really I just wanted to wear the skirt because it was a gift from the awesome Christian Siriano and his show was Saturday but taxis hate Laia and me and traffic is icky and we couldn\u2019t even go. Fail. But from the skirt on it was pretty much just supposed to be old lady/Marc Jacobs-y? Sure, yeah sure. That sounds good when it\u2019s 6 AM. (when I started writing this yesterday)\n\n\u2022 Headpiece made out of a Baggu holder and old guitar strap.\n\n\u2022 Miu Miu top, gift\n\n\u2022 Button-down, hand-me-down (every time I told people \u201chand-me-down\u201d they seemed to be very amused)\n\n\u2022 Christian Siriano skirt\n\n\u2022 We Love Colors tights (awesome Weardrobe conference sponsors \u2026 and I still have that to write about too)\n\n\u2022 Pearls n pearlz, gifts.\n\n\u2022 American Apparel pink mesh dress tied around waist\n\n\u2022 Thrifted belt\n\n\u2022 Shoes found in our basement (which is gross until I remember they are velvet and I love them).\n\nTwo little imps. Photo: Patrick McMullan/Patrick McMullan via Getty Image\n\nThis one is from Saturday night at the Alexander Wang & Katie Grand party. Alex is like this little imp that I want to put in a box and build a little house. If you think this is creepy you would be incorrect.\n\n\u2022 Dress is from Beacon\u2019s Closet, which was one of the stops at the Weardrobe conference. The selection was kind of like any other vintage store (minus a pair of teacup/Galliano-ish shoes I snatched up) but more expensive and angrier staff? I like what we all got though.\n\n\u2022 Lots and lots of random necklaces \u2026\n\n\u2022 The purse was a gift from Hayden Harnett and it\u2019s my new favorite thing.\n\n\u2022 Vintage hat, gift.\n\n\u201cLook, more famous people!\u201d Photo: Jemal Countess/2009 Getty Images\n\nWow this is very quickly becoming a \u201clook, more famous people\u201d post, ack! This was Sunday at Y-3 (WHICH WAS SO AMAZING AND I HAVE THE MOST AMAZING STORY FROM IT) with Geordan and Leigh from The Misshapes.\n\n\u2022 The shirt is from the shoot for Pop. In its prime it was covered with newspaper shreds, made the day after Michael Jackson died, but as Sunday wore on it slowly fell apart (like Michael, as Laia pointed out. HEY NOW, metaphors n fashun!). Also, when you wear shirts with glued-on newspaper in the future, keep in mind that taking a nap in it is not a good idea.\n\n\u2022 The skirt is from the Barney\u2019s Warehouse Sale I went to on the last day of the Weardrobe conference with my dad and Laia. It was a very scary day, especially since it was the last day of the sale, but I got out alive and with what I think was the only Comme des Garcons clothing they had left (there were Tao shoes, but they were too big for me and too triple-digited on the price tag.) It is like a sleeping bag and I looove the way it hangs.\n\n\u2022 Narsty thrifted desert boots.\n\nGo, team! Photo: Patrick McMullan via Getty Image\n\nYeah team! Elizabeth and Laia and me at Patrick Ervell (which was really really good and will get a further review\u2026like, eventually.) Sunday night we all got pizza with Steve and the genius behind Should Be On the Nanny and ADF and Kat. Polio gave all of us nicknames, such as: Febreze van Noten, Duhlaia (Laia), Extravaganza Schouler, Brodarte, and Sugar Ray Kawakubo (guess whooooo.)\n\n\u201cKind of REGAL\u201d Photo: Patrick McMullan via Getty Image\n\nThis was from Monday for Zero + Maria Cornejo, Chris Benz, Thakoon, Patrick Ervell and Marc Jacobs. It is SO ANNOYING to merely mention these when there is so much I want to say about all of them.\n\n\u2022 Luella jacket that was 75% off and calling my name. Long time readers know I have tried to reenact its runway look too many times, it was kind of FATE.\n\n\u2022 Cheongsam, gift.\n\n\u2022 Rodarte tights, gift.\n\n\u2022 Epic teacup/Galliano shoes I was talking about from Beacon\u2019s closet. They deserve a better picture later. Porcelain doll stuffed upside down in pocket, gift from when I was like 5. (The whole outfit was kind of REGAL, the doll made it sort of funny? I crack myself up, at least.)\n\nTuesday\u2019s outfit will go in another post, all this TYPING and BRAIN USING is making me tired. Tuesday night\u2019s involved an unfolded chinese carton on the head, though. Maybe I\u2019ll wear it to school one of these days in the hopes of decapitating\u2026someone. Hyuk.\n\nI went to New York Fashion Week every season for a couple more years, as long as some brand or magazine was footing the bill. Once I started high school, I stopped blogging about fashion, started the teen online magazine Rookie, and at 18, moved to New York to do theater. I\u2019m not invited to as many shows now as I was back then, but I always try to go to Creatures of the Wind/CDLM and Rodarte, labels by friends I\u2019ve now had for a decade. Every now and then, another fashion person tells me about the time they spent a whole party getting life advice from my dad. At Dasha\u2019s birthday party this summer, Derek Blasberg and I were trying to figure out when we did first meet, and to my great surprise, he mentioned the email address I\u2019d used back in the day \u2014 tavitoons@yahoo.com \u2014 with all the swagger of an actual name drop. I was in shock \u2014 impressed and sent way back in time.\n\n\u201cHow do you \u2014 why do you \u2014\u201d\n\nHe winked and said, \u201cWelcome home.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
