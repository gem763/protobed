(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) chastised House Republicans on Monday night for retaliating against his efforts to impeach President Trump rather than assisting in the process.\n\n\u201cIt will be said of House Republicans, When they found they lacked the courage to confront the most dangerous and unethical president in American history, They consoled themselves by attacking those who did,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nOn Monday, the House rejected along party lines a resolution, originally introduced by Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R., Ariz.), that called for Schiff\u2019s resignation and accused him of \u201cegregiously false and fabricated retelling\u201d of President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call. The censure resolution also accused Schiff of making \u201ca mockery of the impeachment process, one of this chamber\u2019s most solemn constitutional duties.\u201d\n\nBiggs was joined by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), and conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R., Colo.) in sponsoring the bill. Following the vote, McCarthy accused Democrats of electing \u201cto put politics over truth.\u201d\n\nJUST NOW \u279c 185 Republicans voted to move forward to condemn and censure Chairman Adam Schiff. Democrats instead chose to put politics over the truth.

The President betrayed the oath of office, our national security and the integrity of our elections, and the GOP has not even tried to deny the facts,\u201d Pelosi\u2019s statement reads. \u201cInstead, Republicans stage confusion, undermine the Constitution and attack the person of whom the President is most afraid.\n\n\u201cThe American people want the truth. The House will proceed with our impeachment inquiry to find the facts and expose the truth, guided by our Constitution and the facts.
