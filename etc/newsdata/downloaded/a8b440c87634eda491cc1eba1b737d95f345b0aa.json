The Syrian government is hostile to foreign NGOs and many remain at risk of arrest.\n\nInternational aid and medical agencies, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and DanChurchAid, all released statements saying their intentional staff had to leave Syria, either partially or fully halting their activities there.\n\nThe UN said this has disrupted the \u201csupply change\u201d of aid to much of northern Syria, which before the latest conflict was already home to nearly a million displaced people who depended on aid to survive.\n\n\u201cDue to changes on the ground and insecurity some NGO partners have had to transfer international staff who were operating in the northeast out of the area, and others have had to temporarily suspend operations,\u201d Hedinn Halldorsson from the agency in Damascus, told The Independent.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A slew of countries including the UK has also imposed arms embargoes on Ankara, to little effect.\n\nBut despite the mounting pressure, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan remained defiant, saying earlier: \u201cWe will never declare a ceasefire.\u201d\n\nBack in Syria, meanwhile, a rebel spokesman confirmed that the \u201coperation is ongoing in Ras al-Ain.\u201d From the Turkish side of the border, ambulances could be seen in war-ravaged town racing away from the front, towards hospitals.\n\nA briefing paper released by the Turkish government said the town centre of Ras al-Ain had been \u201ccleared out of terrorists\u201d along with 1,217 sq km of territory.\n\nAid workers in Syria said international staff having to evacuate the country because of regime presence, would only see the humanitarian crisis worsen.\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent (KRC) called the sudden withdrawal a \u201cdisaster\u201d saying the KRC\u2019s 1,000 or so staffers and volunteers were unable to shoulder the burden alone.\n\n\u201cCoordination has almost collapsed since the international staffers had to leave. The burden was on them to secure cross border aid. We were also dependent on our partners to get funds, we need international doctors to support us,\u201d the KRC\u2019s Dr Sherwan Berry said.\n\n\u201cWe have such a load on our shoulders. We don\u2019t have enough staff to man the hospitals, we lost a lot of clinics to shelling and bombing, we have 300,000 displaced people needing food, shelter, water and medical care. We are struggling to provide for them,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that KRC ambulances had been targeted by Turkish strikes and several hospitals taken out of service because of the fighting.\n\n\u201cTens of thousands of internally displaced civilians are sleeping on the ground, lacking food, medicine and water,\u201d he added.\n\nA senior foreign humanitarian professional, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said should the regime retain control of northeast Syria and the border it would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d as they would not be able to return.\n\n\u201cInternational aid agencies have been supporting hospitals in all the major towns and cities, they have been doing water tucking, bread distribution, rehabilitating schools, water stations and irrigations canals. They are the only actors working on de-mining,\u201d the humanitarian worker said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
