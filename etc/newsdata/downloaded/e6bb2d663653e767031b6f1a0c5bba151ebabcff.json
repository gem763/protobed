When something is so 'of the moment' that it becomes almost ubiquitous, spotted on street-style stars, fashion week front rows and your Instagram feed, it's destined to burn as fast as it does bright - only to be replaced by the next It buy, ad infinitum.\n\nAnd the It bag carries the most status of the lot. Each offering from the biggest designer names on the block comes with fashion credibility and bragging rights (and the short life span to match), especially as so many of these bags are come with long waiting lists, limited supply only serving to increase demand.\n\nBut in recent days (as I type, Extinction Rebellion protests have ground traffic outside our London HQ to a halt) the cult of the new has begun to wane. Fashion's never-ending cycle of buy, buy, buy - and the It bags that encapsulated it - now seems wasteful and out of date.\n\nBut, as a fashion editor, trends are my bread and butter, and it would be disingenuous of me to tell you to ignore them completely, or never to shop again. What I will advise, and a topic of constant conversation on The Telegraph's fashion desk, is the new smart shopper's credo: buy less, but buy better.", "description": "It buys are, by their very nature, short-lived.", "authors": ["Charlie Gowans-Eglinton", "Senior Fashion Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2019/10/14/IMG_1743-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqObqT37dofTE7fWOTQYbqLgqL2Wdvc6oQnYpbGvpIiuI.PNG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
