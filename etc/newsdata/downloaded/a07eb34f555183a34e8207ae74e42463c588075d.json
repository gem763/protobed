The three men began meeting behind closed doors soon after the U.S. delegation arrived Thursday morning.\n\nTurkey's incursion, which began shortly after Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the region, has unleashed a free-for-all inside that corner of Syria, with Russia, Iran and other powers vying for influence.\n\n\"Our mission set is to see if we can get a cease fire, see if we can get this brokered,\" Pompeo told reporters Wednesday, before boarding a plane to Ankara.\n\nDiplomacy?: Turkey's leader rebuffs US call for Syria cease-fire, says he'll meet Pence\n\nBut Erdogan has already rebuffed Trump's demand for a halt to the Turkish attack, shrugging off the White House's threats of crippling economic sanctions and saying he had no plans to pull back. Turkey views the Kurdish fighters \u2013 who helped U.S. forces battle the Islamic State \u2013 as terrorists because of their affiliation with an offshoot group known as the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the PKK.\n\nTrump has almost seemed to echo Turkish talking points in recent days.\n\nLast week, Trump called the PKK \"more of a terrorist threat\" than the Islamic State. And on Wednesday, he said the Kurds are \"not angels.\"\n\nTrump also seemed to distance himself from the crisis in Syria, even as he dispatched Pence and Pompeo to solve it.\n\n\"It's not our problem,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n\nHours later, the House overwhelming passed a bipartisan resolution condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which critics said gave Erdogan a green light to invade territory held by the U.S.-allied Kurds. Trump's comments only seemed to further fuel the bipartisan backlash on Capitol Hill to his troop withdrawal decision.\n\n\"What the president said today is just outrageously dangerous,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \"It undercuts Pence and Pompeo. And I don\u2019t agree with his construct that Turkey's invasion of Syria is of no concern.\"\n\nTrump warned Erdogan \"don't be a tough guy\" in a letter to his counterpart before Ankara launched a deadly incursion in northern Syria.\n\nThe Oct. 9 letter was confirmed by a senior administration official. \"Let\u2019s work out a good deal! You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will,\" Trump wrote.\n\nBBC Turkey reported Thursday that when Erdogan received Trump's letter he scrunched it up and threw it in the trash. He then launched Turkey's offensive against Syria's Kurds. Erdogan's office did not return a request for confirmation of the incident.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump defended his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria on Twitter.\n\n\"I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned,\" the president wrote. \"Democrats always liked that position, until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls, until I built them. Do you see what\u2019s happening here?\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, right, gives a speech as Vice President Mike Pence looks on during a luncheon at the State Department in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 20, 2019.
