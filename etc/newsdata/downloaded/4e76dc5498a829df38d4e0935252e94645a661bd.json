I don\u2019t have money to pay\u201d\n\nSeguin didn\u2019t add any comment beyond the word \u201cMonday\u201d and a face palm emoji, so it\u2019s not known how bad the damage was or where the incident occurred.\n\nKTSA reported that the car was a Ferrari 458 Spider, which went out of production in 2015. The car cost around $240,000 when it was new and could be worth around $210,000 today, according to NADA Guides.\n\nWell, maybe not today.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNevertheless, the five-time All-Star signed an eight-year contract extension with the Stars last year for $78.8 million so the extra depreciation probably won't sting too much.", "description": "It is the thought that counts, right?", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
