It\u2019s fine. You\u2019re certainly allowed to not like it. And \u2013 full credit to you \u2013 the vast majority have simply gone about your ordinary lives while those of us whomst remain slaves to the unholy white choc enjoy this clearly watershed moment. One self-important dumbass, however, has apparently taken it upon himself to not only very loudly let everyone know that he does not like Caramilk, but also rob the world of 16 vitally precious blocks of it by chucking them in a fire, all in the name of content.\n\nBruno Bouchet, who some of you may recognise as a former Kyle & Jackie O producer, has used his \u201cThe List King\u201d guise \u2013 he lists things, sometimes in a bit of a whack order, therefore: the \u201cKing\u201d of them \u2013 to review Caramilk and, in the process, incinerate what he claims is \u201c$16,000\u201d worth of the product.\n\nREAD MORE Hold The Fucken Phone, Rogue Caramilk Philly Cream Cheese Has Been Found In Shops\n\nIn a series of posts on both Instagram and Instagram Stories, Bouchet first claims he had to organise a shady back-room deal to get hold of the 16 blocks, then reviews it by shoving the better part of a whole block into his mouth, then callously tosses the remaining 15 blocks onto a fire.\n\nObserve thusly:\n\nHe just\u2026 yoinks the wrapper off of one\u2026\n\n\u2026shoves it into his gob without even a second thought\u2026\n\n\u2026and then simply piths the rest onto a fire???\n\nLike that. He just\u2026 does all that.\n\nThe fact that this is a grown-ass man filming himself while shirtless and wearing a cheap plastic crown aside, who burns perfectly good chocolate like that? More specifically, who burns perfectly good CARAMILK like that, when my tum specifically has gone begging for it thus far?\n\nOutrageous conduct. Truly despicable behaviour.\n\nAdditionally, the \u201c$16,000\u201d claim is off by a shade over $15,900 or so. But hey, if you want to extrapolate one outrageous eBay listing for the sake of an outlandish headline, then who am I to stand in the way of The List King.\n\nGo off, chief. Keep fighting the good fight.
