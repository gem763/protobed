Katie Hill had relationship with staffer", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nThe House Ethics Committee announced Wednesday it has opened an investigation into allegations that freshman Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., engaged in a sexual relationship with a staff member. Hill has denied the allegations.\n\n\"The Committee notes that the mere fact that it is investigating these allegations, and publicly disclosing its review, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee,\" Chairman Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Ranking Member Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHill denied the allegations and said she has contacted police after a nude photo of her was published online. She said in a statement that the claims she had been in a relationship with her legislative director are \"absolutely false.\" Hill and her husband are going through a divorce, she said.\n\n\"I have notified Capitol Hill police who are investigating the situation and potential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos, and therefore will have no further comment on the digital materials,\" Hill said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to congressional rules, relationships between members of the House of Representatives and their subordinates are not permitted. Hill said Wednesday in a letter to constituents that she is fully cooperating with the committee's investigation.\n\nThe allegations of the relationship were first published by conservative website RedState.com. The site also posted a nude photo purportedly of Hill with another person, along with a second allegation that Hill had a relationship with an unidentified campaign staffer. Hill acknowledged that relationship in her letter to constituents Wednesday.\n\n\"I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize,\" Hill wrote. \"I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\"\n\nThe campaign staffer is not a member of Hill\u2019s congressional staff.\n\nHill, who was elected in 2018 in a swing district race, said this controversy won't sidetrack her work in Congress. She is also the vice chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Its chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings, died last week.", "description": "California Rep.
