He said he had an appreciation for \u201cthe grind\u201d as he saw the running backs rotate in and out of the building every year.\n\nThat\u2019s why, even with a reduced role, Peterson says he can appreciate he\u2019s still being in the league after 13 seasons.\n\nThe Redskins will turn to Derrius Guice to be their primary running back Sunday when Washington opens the season in Philadelphia. Coach Jay Gruden said earlier this week that the offense with \u201cgo through\u201d their 2018 second-rounder, and on Thursday, even left open the possibility for Peterson to be inactive in Week 1.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Peterson said he understands the situation.\n\n\u201cI knew when I came in, this scenario, (Guice) was down,\u201d Peterson said, referencing the running back\u2019s ACL tear last season. \u201cI came in and was able to fill the void for a good period of time and they drafted this kid in the second round and so, of course, they want to give him a shot.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been working real hard to come back to get on the field. So at the end of the day, I\u2019m pleased do what they ask me to do. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d\n\nPeterson, who rushed for 1,042 yards in 2018, could possibly be inactive because he doesn\u2019t contribute on special teams. Teams are only allowed to have 46 players active on gamedays, and most teams typically make three running backs active. The Redskins added running back Wendell Smallwood on Monday because of his ability to play special teams.\n\nGruden said the team will make a determination on Peterson\u2019s status before kickoff.\n\n\u201cThe issue is you\u2019ve got one ball and if you\u2019re going to hand the ball off 25 times a game, only so many carries can go around,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cYou still have Chris Thompson up and Adrian. So, the big thing is we get somebody ready for the mother load and everybody else is ready for whatever else they can get. That can change next week, it can change the week after, but initially we have to have a plan and go with it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
