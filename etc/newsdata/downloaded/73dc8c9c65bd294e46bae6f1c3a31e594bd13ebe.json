The fact Alkmaar have been playing all their home games here for the last two months, inevitably means they will have an advantage.\n\nThe concern over the surface was one of the main reasons behind Solskjaer\u2019s decision to leave Paul Pogba out of the squad which travelled to Holland on Wednesday, although it is doubtful the France international would have started the game anyway as his workload is being managed following a return from a foot injury.\n\nScott McTominay, Daniel James and Jesse Lingard get used to the artificial pitch they will play on when Manchester United face AZ Alkmaar Credit: Reuters\n\n\u201cI'm surprised they've chosen to play on this pitch when I look at it,\u201d said Solskjaer, who has not won away game since the victory over Paris Saint Germain at the start of March.\n\n\u201cI'm used to astro turf pitches in Norway, it's not the best I've seen, it's one of the worst ones I've seen for a long while. We've all got standards back home in Norway and they are all modern and new\u2026 it's safe, I'm not saying that... it's just not the newest.\n\n\u201cIt's just on the floor, so on the carpet more or less, so when you pull the grass up [and] you [need] to do that loads, there's more bounce. It seems like it's been used a lot\n\n\u201cI'm surprised that, in this climate, you have to use astro turf. It\u2019s ok when you live in the North Pole, like we more or less do in Norway, and can't play in March, November or December, but here, I'm surprised.\n\n\u201cAs we said on the way here, there's a different style of football you have to play on astro turf, there are parts of the game which will become different, there's less tackles\u2026 but you can\u2019t ban them because you can't force the Norwegian teams to have natural grass. I don't think that's possible. But if I was running a club down here, I wouldn't have an astro turf pitch.\u201d\n\nSolkjaer was glad to have something to complain about, as it limited the time spent discussing his team\u2019s deficiencies.\n\nUnited are 10th in the Premier League after the 1-1 draw with Arsenal and have not won on the road in nine attempts.\n\nAZ would already have been tough opponents \u2013 they are third in the Eredivisie behind Ajax and PSV Eindhoven and have lost only one game this season \u2013 but the pitch also works in their favour.\n\n\u201cYou keep talking about concerns, Solskjaer replied when asked if he was worried about their poor start to the campaign. \u201cWe are a good team and the last few games, we're a good team to counter-attack. We have been winning 1-0 in games, those games should suit us more and we've played some very good away games, let's hope I can sit here tomorrow and you ask a different question.\u201d", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has criticised the decision to move Manchester United\u2019s Europa League tie against AZ Alkmaar on to an artificial pitch which he described as one of the worst he has seen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s0QMIPfEL778j21roiiWwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EJRWHGg2jEb4BWFW67KogA--~B/aD0xNDk5O3c9MjM5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/b8c9e80fa40ce0980a0925afea94865c"}
