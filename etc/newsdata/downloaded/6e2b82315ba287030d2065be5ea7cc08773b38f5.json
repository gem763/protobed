Universities launch degrees in esports", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON (AP) - On their first week in class, a group of students is playing a first-person shooter video game in a sleek new digital studio. It\u2019s their introduction to the degree in esports they\u2019ve all enrolled in.\n\nThe group clicking away on their mice are at the University of Staffordshire, one of several U.K. and U.S. schools launching programs aimed at capitalizing on the booming industry\u2019s need for skilled professionals.\n\nRyan Chapman, 18, said his parents were \u201cskeptical at first\u201d about studying esports, or competitive multiplayer videogaming.\n\n\u201cBut now they understand how big the industry is growing, the pace it\u2019s growing at. They\u2019re now really all for it because it\u2019s a great industry to start to get into,\u201d said Chapman, who was among the students in the lab playing Counter-Strike, one of the most popular esports games.\n\nThe University of Staffordshire last year launched its bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s esports programs, in which students mainly learn marketing and management skills tailored to the industry. This autumn, it\u2019s expanding the program to London while other schools are also debuting esports degree courses, including Britain\u2019s Chichester University, Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah University, Becker College in Massachusetts and The Ohio State University. In Asia, where esports has seen strong growth, schools in Singapore and China offer courses.\n\nThe global esports market is expected to surge to $1.1 billion this year, up $230 million from 2018 on growth in sponsorships, merchandise and ticket sales, according to Newzoo. The research firm expects the global esports audience to grow in 2019 to about 454 million as fans tune in on livestreaming platforms such as Twitch and Microsoft\u2019s Mixer.\n\nEsports tournaments have become a cultural phenomenon and now rival traditional sports events in size and scale. Big competitions are held in arenas where thousands of fans watch big-name professional video gamers compete for lucrative prize pools.\n\nEsports leagues have franchises in North America, Europe and Asia. The biggest names, such as Fortnite superstar Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins, can earn millions in prize money and livestreaming deals. Esports are even set to be a medal event at the Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines in November.\n\nDozens of U.S. colleges have offered varsity level esports competitions for years. But some schools are taking it a step further by adding courses as the industry\u2019s boom drives demand for professionals who know how to, for example, organize esports tournaments.\n\nNew niche degrees partly highlight the changing economy, but they also reflect the \u201cneed to communicate to parents and students that there will be a job waiting for someone once they earn a degree,\u201d which may include hefty tuition fees and student loans to pay for them, said Joni Finney, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Institute for Research on Higher Education.\n\nShe worried that some degrees are too specialized and that some schools are launching them to offset falling enrolment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really up to the faculty of those institutions to step up and say, \u2018You know, a degree in business will cover these kinds of jobs,\u2019 rather than saying we have a degree in a certain job category,\u201d Finney said.\n\nBecker College formally launched its Bachelor of Science in esports management this month after an initial \u201csoft release\u201d last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer kids playing games in their basement,\u201d said Alan Ritacco, dean of Becker College\u2019s School of Design and Technology. The top esports players now earn almost as much as the highest paid stars in traditional sports like golf or tennis, he said.\n\nThe schools emphasize that their courses aren\u2019t about just playing video games.\n\n\u201cPeople are unaware of the industry that goes behind esports,\u201d said Matt Huxley, a lecturer at Staffordshire University\u2019s Digital Institute London, a new outpost the university, near Birmingham, England, opened so students could be closer to game companies in the British capital.\n\nHuxley, who teaches a class on organizing tournaments, said learning about esports was akin to studying sports management.\n\n\u201cIf you were to go and study to be a director of football you\u2019re not playing football, you\u2019re learning the business behind how (player) transfers work, how you run a stadium and all those kind of operational things.\u201d\n\nChichester University hired former pro gamer Rams Singh, known as R2K, as a senior lecturer for its program, which includes playing games such as FIFA and League of Legends as part of the course.\n\nOhio State is poised to launch an esports and game studies undergraduate major that will include the application of games to health and medicine.\n\nA business focus helps to ease worries among students and parents about paying tuition for degrees that have no track record. In Britain, standard tuition fees are set at 9,250 pounds ($11,430) a year while the U.S. programs charge as much as $36,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be risks but I have zero regrets,\u201d said Ellis Celia, 26, who is also starting the Staffordshire course. The industry \u201ccan only go up at this point,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nFor all of AP\u2019s tech coverage, visit https://apnews.com/apf-technology\n\n___\n\nFollow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.com/chanman\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "On their first week in class, a group of students is playing a first-person shooter video game in a sleek new digital studio.
