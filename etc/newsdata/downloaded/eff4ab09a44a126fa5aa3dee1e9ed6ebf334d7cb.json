And thus far they mostly have not, choosing instead to either cheer on the president or stay silent on the matter. Just like that, a democratic norm stretching back to the founding of the republic is collapsing before our eyes.\n\nRead: Democrats must act now to deter foreign interference in the 2020 election\n\nIn his remarks, Trump called on the Ukrainian government to open a \u201cmajor\u201d corruption investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2014saying out loud what he had quietly conveyed to the Ukrainian president in a phone call now at the center of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats. Then the president went much further still, encouraging the Chinese government, which is embroiled in a trade war with the Trump administration, to launch a probe into the Bidens\u2019 business dealings as well.\n\nBeijing is unlikely to comply with Trump\u2019s wishes, but that doesn\u2019t make the president\u2019s move any less striking. With regard to China, Trump wasn\u2019t just exploiting his foreign-policy making powers to target Biden and possibly violating the law by asking for something of value to his campaign from a foreign national, as appears to be the case with Ukraine. He was also turning for help in his reelection bid to an authoritarian adversary. In both instances, Trump was attempting to assign investigations into his domestic rival not to his own law-enforcement agencies but to those of Ukraine and China, ranked 77th and 82nd out of 126 countries, respectively, in a recent global survey of the rule of law.\n\nRead: Imagine if Obama had done this\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump has cast the solicitation of political assistance from whichever foreign power is forthcoming as a routine \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cabsolute right\u201d of his office. \u201cAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time,\u201d he wrote on Twitter today. Trump\u2019s concern about corruption, however, happens to focus solely on a case affecting his personal political interests and one he claims to have already cracked despite a lack of evidence.\n\nIn the face of all this, Republicans have largely joined ranks with the president or held their fire. Asked whether Trump\u2019s China comments were appropriate, Pence deferred this time around to his boss, noting that the American people have a \u201cright to know\u201d whether Biden or his family \u201cprofited from his position,\u201d and that Trump clearly believes \u201cother nations around the world should look into it as well.\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican leader in the House, has yet to say anything about the president\u2019s overture to China, instead pressing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to suspend her impeachment inquiry, because of flaws in the process. Graham, who says he has \u201czero problems\u201d with Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president, has gently pushed back against the president\u2019s latest salvo in his campaign against Biden while defending it as an understandable response to persecution. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go down that road,\u201d Graham told The Washington Post regarding a Chinese probe of the Biden family, but Trump \u201cfeels like everyone is coming after him all the time and he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump encouraged two foreign governments, including a U.S. adversary, to interfere in the 2020 election.
