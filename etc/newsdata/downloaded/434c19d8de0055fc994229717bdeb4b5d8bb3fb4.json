The outraged Trump campaign called it a \u201ca phony and outlandish bill.\u201d They insisted they have a contract with the city and if it doesn't comply, it can expect a lawsuit. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale also accused Frey of making a splash to boost his own political career.\n\n\u201cThis is an outrageous abuse of power by a liberal mayor trying to deny the rights of his own city\u2019s residents just because he hates the President,\u201d Parscale said in a statement. \u201cPeople want to hear from their President, and no mayor looking to beef up his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a run for higher office should stand in the way.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump issued his own message for the mayor on Twitter, which Frey did not take seriously.\n\nYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nBack in September when Trump announced he was heading to Minneapolis, Frey told him that his \u201cmessage of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d He also regretted that there was \"no legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting.\"\n\nThe feud between Trump and Frey won't be the only sticky context of Thursday's rally. Antifa is expected to show up too, as Julio reported earlier.\n\nThis is one of a handful of trips Trump has made to Minnesota in the past year. He came close in 2016, and he and his campaign surrogates are confident they can flip the state red in 2020. Are Democrats getting nervous?", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:30:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/312/67ca8f70-2ec1-4d32-8fa0-4fee972c33d1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
