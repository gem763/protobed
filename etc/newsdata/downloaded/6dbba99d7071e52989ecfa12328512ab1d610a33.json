Photo-Illustration: Vulture and Photo by Getty Images\n\nThis interview originally ran in October 2018. We are rerunning it in anticipation of Nikki Glaser\u2019s appearance on the Comedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin.\n\nRoast jokes are deceptive little things. They tend to be very short, very to the point. But they\u2019re often weeks and weeks in the making. Beyond the writing staff tasked with amassing a pile of jokes to be divided among the celebrity members of a Comedy Central dais, every comedian involved is writing essentially nonstop, as well receiving a fairly constant stream of joke-ideas from comic friends. A comedian will then run the jokes over and over again at clubs around the city, as they would for any other TV set. So, when you see Nikki Glaser prove herself as one of the absolute best ever roasters on the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis, you can be certain that every one of those jokes has been considered and reworked ad nauseam.\n\nGlaser\u2019s set is the subject of this week\u2019s episode of Good One, Vulture Comedy\u2019s podcast about jokes and the people who write them. Listen to the episode and read a short excerpt of the discussion about a few of Glaser\u2019s best jokes below. Tune in to Good One every Monday on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\n[From the Roast of Rob Lowe, to Ann Coulter] \u201cThe only person you will ever make happy is the Mexican that digs your grave.\u201d\n\nI wanted to go hard on Ann Coulter. Amy [Schumer] was the one that was really like, \u201cHey, you have a chance here. Just say what everyone wants to. Just go hard on her. Go harder than you want to go.\u201d I really took that to heart and was like, \u201cI will, because what do I have to lose?\u201d If I want to stand out, that\u2019s a great way to stand out.\n\nThen that joke was pitched to me by Mike Lawrence, who is a great roast joke writer and roaster. He\u2019s won Roast Battle. It was pitched to me while I was in the makeup chair right before we were going on, because they were like, \u201cHere\u2019s some jokes no one\u2019s doing that the writer\u2019s room came up with.\u201d Mike really believed in it and I trust Mike. And everyone in my trailer at the time was like, \u201cOh, my God, that joke.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t like the joke because I didn\u2019t like throwing Mexicans under the bus in a joke that is supposed to be like them saying \u201cfuck you\u201d to her. It didn\u2019t need to be a Mexican. It could\u2019ve just been the person who digs your grave and it would\u2019ve still been a good joke. I get it, it\u2019s like she hates Mexicans, so a Mexican might maybe [would] relish the fact that they get to dig her grave more, but it also is saying that Mexicans dig graves more than white people. I didn\u2019t like that sentiment of it.\n\nI kind of cringe every time it\u2019s brought up as representative of me as a comedian, because I could\u2019ve been called out for being racist in that joke that was supposed to be going against someone who is blatantly racist. It\u2019s not my favorite joke, but I\u2019m grateful for it. A lot of times as a celebrity or anyone who is in the spotlight, you get thrust into the spotlight for something that you were like, \u201cI almost didn\u2019t even say that,\u201d or, \u201cI regretted saying that at the time.\u201d I\u2019m grateful for it. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t like the joke. I did it. I don\u2019t want to insult Mike Lawrence, who wrote the joke, but it\u2019s not my favorite joke. It\u2019s just the meanest thing to say, and sometimes you need to say that to Ann Coulter. I just wish it didn\u2019t throw Mexicans under the bus.\n\n\u201cKevin Pollak is here. Such an amazing actor \u2026 I know Kevin as one of the greatest impressionists of all time. I\u2019m a huge fan. My favorite of his is, umm \u2026 he does an amazing Robin Williams. I just wish you would finish it \u2026 Listen, all I\u2019m saying is that we\u2019ve lost a lot of greats to suicide recently, and it\u2019s time we lose some okays.\u201d\n\nThat was my favorite joke. Man, it had a longer ending, too, that I had to chop off. I was like, \u201cNo, but seriously, your loved ones will miss you. And \u2018by your loved ones,\u2019 I mean your assortment of hats.\u201d I go, \u201cDon\u2019t leave a note. Just print off your IMDb page.\u201d Like, it just went on and on. It was so mean.\n\nSomeone had written a joke that he\u2019s an impressionist and he does a Robin Williams impression. They didn\u2019t write [this] joke, but [theirs] had mentioned it. I was like, Oh, really? Then I was like, There\u2019s my ticket to a suicide joke. When I wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of greats, but it\u2019s time to lose some okays,\u201d that was just one that I was like, That is one of my favorite jokes I\u2019ve ever written. Just it\u2019s so insane to tell someone to kill themselves. Twice. Really lean into it.\n\nI wanted to acknowledge it. This is the thing. Anthony Bourdain had just killed himself. Kate Spade had just killed herself. It was in the zeitgeist. I was like, I know this is going to get a huge groan. I know people are going to be talking about it and saying how insensitive it is that I would say that. But I talk a lot about suicide in my act. I think a lot about suicide. I\u2019m a depressed person. I have dark thoughts about it. I feel like if I don\u2019t talk about it and if I don\u2019t lean into it, then it\u2019s winning. I want to acknowledge it more.\n\nI was running this joke around town and I remember one time a girl in the front row was like, \u201cNot cool.\u201d I go, \u201cOh, have you lost someone to suicide?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYeah.\u201d I go, \u201cSo has everyone. Everyone!\u201d I go, \u201cThe only person that can get offended by a joke about suicide is someone who committed suicide. And guess what? None of those people are here tonight, so shut up.\u201d I have lost loved ones. I\u2019ve struggled with suicidal thoughts. I really feel, like, more entitled to that joke than any joke. I probably should feel less entitled to it, to be honest, because it\u2019s the meanest one.\n\nI got a lot of backlash for it, but then I realized, I know that Robin Williams would think that\u2019s funny. I just know. I had never met him, but I just know that he would think that\u2019s funny, because it\u2019s funny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan and my mom is an even bigger fan. My mom has learned everything from Martha Stewart, including cooking, cleaning, and withholding affection.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t even plan on doing that joke. That was not in the prompter, but I had been working on it all week. It just was one of the ones cut right before. Then she wasn\u2019t that nice to me backstage right before we went on. Like I could just tell she was as cold as I thought she was. I had thought, Certainly she\u2019s not as cold as I\u2019m writing all these jokes out to be, and then she was, and I was like, I\u2019ve got to do that joke, because there is so much truth in that joke on every level, and I just witnessed it backstage.\n\nI was scared to even look at Cybill Shepherd after I got offstage, but she came up to me and gave me the biggest hug and was like, \u201cYou were amazing.\u201d I was just like looking at Martha like, Where\u2019s my love, Martha? She didn\u2019t even say \u201cgood job\u201d \u2014 that old bitch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not a big fan of action movies. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen one of your films \u2026 consensually. Like it\u2019s always something a guy puts on when he\u2019s trying to finger me on his roommate\u2019s couch. Maybe I didn\u2019t understand The Fifth Element. And it isn\u2019t because I\u2019m a dumb girl. But it\u2019s hard to follow that plot when you\u2019re fighting off a roofie and there\u2019s a knuckle inside you.\u201d\n\nI wanted to write to women who have been fingered on a couch to his movies. That joke was really written about The Usual Suspects. At first, it started out as a joke about all the men \u2014 Kevin Pollak is in Usual Suspects; Edward Norton, Fight Club; Bruce Willis, The Fifth Element. These are all movies that I watched because I was about to hook up with a guy. I was like, There\u2019s something there.\n\nThe more I talked to women, I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, this is a thing. It\u2019s a movie the guy puts on.\u201d I wanted to say that I\u2019ve gotten fingered to these movies: \u201cI just watch the screen dead-eyed as I\u2019m being fingered.\u201d Like I\u2019ve watched scenes and not known what\u2019s happening because I\u2019m trying to deal with what\u2019s maybe happening to me.\n\nThe thing is, the sex act is consensual. Those are all consensual, but the movies themselves always felt like, I don\u2019t want to watch this, but okay. So, it felt of-the-times to say that. It felt true. Like I didn\u2019t want to watch those movies, and I had to, and I still don\u2019t want to watch them. They\u2019re still movies I see all the time, for men.\n\nThat just was one of those jokes. I literally wrote \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one of your movies consensually,\u201d as that was me getting to a point, but that just got a laugh out of nowhere. I was like, Oh, is that funny? I didn\u2019t even know. Sometimes you write a joke as a comedian and you go, Why is that funny? It\u2019s just truth.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "description": "Nikki Glaser talks about all the work that went into putting together sets for the Comedy Central roasts of Bruce Willis and Rob Lowe.", "authors": ["Jesse David Fox"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/10/26/26-good-one-nikki-glazer.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
