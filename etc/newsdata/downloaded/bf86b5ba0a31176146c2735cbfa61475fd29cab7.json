Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAfter a week of depositions from key figures in the impeachment inquiry, Democrats are coalescing around a push to prove that Trump committed impeachable offenses at least partly by showing that Trump had intimate knowledge of and directed Giuliani\u2019s plans, goals and tactics.\n\nButtressing their strategy is a modest but intensifying public outcry among Republicans over Giuliani\u2019s shadow diplomacy, in which the former New York City mayor sought to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and revive a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Democrats like Swalwell who represent safe liberal districts. Rep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.), a moderate freshman whose Orange County seat Republicans are targeting, said it is clear that Trump had a deep understanding of the details of Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine crusade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not just talking about the weather and their golf games,\u201d Rouda quipped in a brief interview, referencing the pair\u2019s frequent meetings and phone calls. \u201cEspecially when it\u2019s also very clear from the evidence that President Trump directed members of the State Department to work directly with Giuliani in their efforts in Ukraine. So the nexus is there. There is no debating the facts.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say they\u2019re beginning to see a GOP strategy developing \u2014 one that tacitly criticizes Giuliani but treats his actions in Ukraine as a rogue, one-man mission that was not specifically sanctioned by Trump.\n\n\u201cThe idea is let\u2019s throw everyone including Rudy under the bus to protect the president,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.). \u201cThe cast of characters around him continue to change all the time. But there's one constant \u2014 and that constant is the source of all the chaos, and that's him.\u201d\n\nDespite the impeachment inquiry\u2019s laser-like focus on Giuliani, Trump has given no indication he intends to cut ties with the former New York City mayor any time soon \u2014 even if Giuliani\u2019s actions in Ukraine become the central driver of Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer,\u201d Trump said Saturday.\n\nIn contrast to his treatment of Giuliani, Trump bashed his former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen after Cohen became embroiled in legal trouble in part for work he did for the president. The break began when Cohen turned on the president, ultimately blaming his former client for landing him in prison over campaign finance violations that prosecutors say Trump directed.\n\nBut some Democrats say it\u2019s only a matter of time until Trump treats Giuliani to the same fate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before, with Michael Cohen,\u201d Rouda said. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s going to get thrown under the bus. The president's going to make it sound like \u2018I didn\u2019t tell him to do this or that, he was rogue, he went out on his own.\u2019 And we all know that\u2019s not true, but I think we can all lay a bet down on how this story ends. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see.\u201d\n\nDemocrats seeking to substantiate Trump\u2019s intimate involvement with Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts have been bolstered by a parade of witnesses detailing the extent to which Trump sought to run his Ukraine policy through Giuliani, who was pressing Kyiv to launch probes of Trump\u2019s political rivals. That body of testimony is set to grow next week, when Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, testifies on Tuesday, in addition to some State Department and Pentagon officials later in the week.\n\nOne witness who has already testified for nine hours, Gordon Sondland, underscored the \u201cnexus\u201d that Democrats see between Trump and Giuliani. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said he was ultimately \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Trump\u2019s desire to involve Giuliani.\n\n\u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Sondland told investigators, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by POLITICO.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, though, Republicans have indicated they\u2019re uncomfortable with Giuliani\u2019s behavior toward Ukraine and have questioned his methods and mission. Though Trump\u2019s allies are careful to pin any questionable conduct on Giuliani alone, Democrats see their unwillingness to defend Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine as an opening to tie potential wrongdoing to the president.\n\nRepublicans, though, are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, saying they\u2019re not sure that the president had full awareness of Giuliani\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the president knew everything that Rudy was saying and doing. And if I was asked to make an assumption, I would say that he didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nBut even some of the president\u2019s closest allies have suggested that Giuliani\u2019s involvement wasn\u2019t above-board. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) distanced himself from the \u201cCrowdstrike\u201d theory that both Giuliani and Trump have pursued and amplified \u2014 the debunked assertion that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a \u2018Crowdstrike\u2019 fan,\u201d Meadows told POLITICO, adding: \u201cI would not, on my dime, send a private attorney looking for some server in a foreign country.\u201d\n\nBut Meadows said it was understandable that Trump, who feels aggrieved that he has been investigated for ties to Russia, would listen to Giuliani.\n\n\u201cWhen you get falsely accused of a number of things that are not facts, you\u2019re willing to listen to a whole lot of things that may have been a problem,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nBut attempts by Republicans seeking to separate Trump from Giuliani were complicated Thursday when Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney declared that the White House withheld military assistance from Ukraine in part because Trump wanted assurances that the country\u2019s new president would probe the debunked Crowdstrike matter. Mulvaney later walked back the comments.\n\nThere are indications, though, that some House Republicans are beginning to question Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful to me to see this kind of amateur diplomacy riding roughshod over our State Department apparatus,\u201d said Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), a former ambassador and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Rooney on Friday indicated that he was open to supporting impeachment but is awaiting more witness interviews.\n\n\u201cI want to get the facts and do the right thing,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking at anybody in this building.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle, Melanie Zanona and Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.com on Oct. 18, 2019.", "description": "Democrats are zeroing in on Rudy Giuliani to impeach the president.", "authors": ["Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3d/11/5dc6f647405bb298914a1cbbb7a5/191018-donald-trump-giuliani-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
