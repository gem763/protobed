(Lynne Sladky)\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the Pittsburgh Steelers announced that their offense would be taking a sizable hit with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger out for the season with an elbow injury. But only hours later, the Steelers shored up their defense after working out a trade for disgruntled Dolphins defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick, who had demanded a trade out of tanking Miami.\n\nThe price was high: Pittsburgh will send its first-round draft pick in 2020 to the Dolphins, plus a fifth-round draft choice in 2020 and a sixth-round pick in 2021. Miami will send Fitzpatrick to the Steelers along with a fourth-round choice in 2020 and a seventh-round pick in 2021.\n\n[NFL power rankings after Week 2: Cowboys, Ravens move up as other suffer quarterback unrest]\n\nPittsburgh needed help in its defensive backfield after safety Sean Davis suffered a torn labrum against Seattle on Sunday, but Davis may be best utilized as a slot cornerback. According to Pro Football Focus, Fitzpatrick in 2018 was one of the best rookie slot cornerbacks to ever play the game, ranking first in completion percentage allowed (51.3 percent) and passer rating allowed (53.4) among the 34 defensive players with 200 or more coverage snaps played in the slot.\n\nNevertheless, the Dolphins wanted him all over the field and reportedly had him learn six positions during the offseason, including two linebacker slots, and Fitzpatrick wanted no part of either that or Miami\u2019s fairly obvious tank job.\n\nConsidering the NFL\u2019s move to pass-heavy offenses, standout slot cornerbacks are valuable assets. Mike Hilton, the Steelers\u2019 primary slot cornerback, has earned just a 44.6 coverage grade through two games, according to Pro Football Focus, ranking 30th among the 35 NFL defenders with 40 or more coverage snaps played in the slot. Pittsburgh has allowed an average of 320 passing yards through two games this season (29th in the NFL) along with six touchdowns through the air. Only the Dolphins have allowed more.\n\nMiami\u2019s demolition/rebuilding project continues, meanwhile, with so much momentum that the team now feels free to trade away a player drafted with the No. 11 overall pick just last year.\n\nThe Dolphins now own five picks in the first two rounds of next year\u2019s draft (three of them in the first round) and four picks in the first two rounds of the 2021 draft (two first-rounders). According to ESPN\u2019s Football Power Index, the first-round pick Miami acquired from the Steelers has a 29 percent chance to be in the top five and a 62 percent chance to be in the top 10.\n\nThe first-round pick that belongs to the Dolphins themselves seems almost certain to be in the top five, at the very worst. Miami has been outscored 102-10 in losses to the Ravens and Patriots and plays the streaking Cowboys and playoff-worthy Chargers the next two weeks. The Dolphins also travel to Pittsburgh to play the Steelers and Fitzpatrick on Oct. 28.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nBen Roethlisberger out for the season, will have elbow surgery\n\nEli Manning\u2019s time as Giants starter might be over\n\nJohn Clayton: Can any of the NFL\u2019s 0-2 teams make a playoff run?\n\nThe NFL\u2019s pass interference replay rule has brought more confusion than clarity\n\nLamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you", "description": "Miami gets yet another first-round draft pick in return.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead", "September At Am", "Matt Bonesteel Spent The First Years Of His Washington Post Career Writing", "Editing.
