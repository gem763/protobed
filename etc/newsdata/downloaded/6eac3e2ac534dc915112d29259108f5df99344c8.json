Organizers earlier this week said sites for Monday\u2019s protests were chosen because of traffic volume and their proximity to the offices of \u201cclimate criminals\u201d such as petroleum companies and lobbyists for the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe group released a march route, which roughly includes streets in an area between 15th and 12th streets NW, and I Street and Constitution Avenue NW. Bamberger said nonviolent \u201cdisruption will be part of the action.\u201d\n\nOrganizers didn\u2019t know how many protesters to expect.\n\n\u201cWe expect that people will respond to the communications we\u2019ve had since we\u2019ve built up a lot of energy around this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell how many people will come.\u201d\n\nAlaina Gertz, a D.C. police spokeswoman, said in an email that police were \u201caware of the assembly,\u201d but no traffic advisories were in place. She said police weren\u2019t discussing tactics for handling the protest.\n\n[Countries promise more aggressive action at U.N. climate summit, but is it enough?]\n\nThe D.C. protests come after climate change rallies around the world ahead of the United Nations climate summit this week in New York. Last Friday, millions of people in 150 countries protested, asking policymakers to do something to slow the planet\u2019s warming.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy nurses, America\u2019s most trusted professionals, are demanding \u2018climate justice\u2019\n\n\u2018We will make them hear us\u2019: Millions of youths around the world strike for action\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Protesters shut down intersections in the city Monday to call attention to global warming.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
