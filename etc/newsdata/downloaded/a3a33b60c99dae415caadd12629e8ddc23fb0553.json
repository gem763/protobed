(Melody Burkholder)\n\nA Times review of inspection reports and court records has revealed serious failures of oversight in the care of patients at Kedren\u2019s acute psychiatric hospital, a key resource for people struggling with mental illness.\n\nAmong the cases: One patient reported being choked by a Kedren employee. Another said she had been sexually assaulted by her roommate. There was no evidence the hospital investigated either complaint, according to state inspectors.\n\nIn recent years, several former employees have alleged in lawsuits that they were fired for reporting serious misconduct and dangerous practices at the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims have focused scrutiny on a historic institution founded in the ashes of the Watts riots, which for more than 50 years has been a mainstay of mental health, primary care, education and other family services.\n\nThe inspection in the wake of Masters\u2019 death found widespread safety issues at the hospital that put patients in \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d of harm or death.\n\nKedren Community Health Center. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nOf the nearly 800 similar inspections conducted at psychiatric hospitals across the nation last year, that level of violation was found only 28 times, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, the administrator of the federal healthcare programs.\n\nState, local and federal regulators say that Kedren has carried out numerous reforms and is capable of providing quality care to its patients. Since the July 2018 inspection, the hospital has added 24-hour psychiatric coverage, appointed a medical director of inpatient psychiatry and installed new software systems to track patients and reports of safety violations.\n\nIn March, Kedren\u2019s federal certification was renewed.\n\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health confirmed that \u201cthe facility is back in compliance with both state and federal requirements.\n\nBrian Kamel, the hospital\u2019s attorney, said in an emailed statement: \u201cKedren has had an outstanding history over the [last] approximate 52 years of providing mental health services to an under-served, underprivileged, and diverse community in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nBut records reviewed by The Times raise significant questions about the hospital\u2019s operations and show that Kedren\u2019s leadership was slow to react when made aware of safety concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo weeks after Masters\u2019 death, the hospital\u2019s board of directors met to review the incident. They suggested a psychiatrist be present in the evenings to immediately evaluate and treat patients admitted after-hours, according to meeting minutes obtained by federal inspectors.\n\nBut eight months after the board\u2019s recommendation, inspectors learned, the hospital still had no after-hours psychiatrist on duty.\n\nInspectors found that the hospital\u2019s chief executive and president at the time, Dr. John Griffith, had not reviewed an internal postmortem report of the incident, which itself was undated and vague. The report included no mention of the lack of psychiatric evaluations or patient monitoring and gave no recommendations. When interviewed, Griffith told the inspectors, \u201cThings could have been managed much better.\u201d\n\nMore than a year after Masters\u2019 death, a patient, who hadn\u2019t been seen by a doctor, broke a toilet and attacked a security guard with one of the shards, according to a follow-up survey.\n\nOnly then did Kedren implement round-the-clock full psychiatric clinical care, the survey stated.\n\nGriffith is still the facility\u2019s president. Neither he nor Yolanda Whittington, the hospital\u2019s new CEO, responded to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cEverything was done properly,\u201d Kamel said in response to questions about Masters\u2019 death.\n\nViolence in psychiatric hospitals is not uncommon. The California Department of State Hospitals, which runs five such facilities across the state for people ordered into treatment by a court, reported more than 3,500 incidents of patient-on-patient violence in 2017 and an additional 3,300 involving staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut experts say that hospital homicides are rare and that the allegations surrounding Masters\u2019 death are extraordinary.\n\n\u201cIf accurate, it\u2019s a shocking deviation from ordinary standards of practice,\u201d said Dr. Steven Hoge, director of the Forensic Psychiatry Fellowship Program at Columbia University, referring to the hospital\u2019s failure to evaluate and monitor Masters\u2019 alleged assailant.\n\nKedren was founded by a group of black psychiatrists in the wake of the 1965 Watts riots to address the poverty, discrimination, violence and education gaps that underpinned much of the unrest \u2014 and that are still prevalent.\n\nOver the years Kedren has expanded its outpatient programs while adding beds to the hospital. Funded primarily by Los Angeles County, the nonprofit provides mental health care to nearly 14,000 people. According to a 2018 financial report, its operating budget is some $39 million.\n\nThe vast majority of the hospital\u2019s patients are, like Masters, detained under a California law that allows people with severe mental illness to be involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital if they are a danger to themselves, a danger to others, or \u201cgravely disabled.\u201d\n\nHarold Turner, director of programs at the Urban Los Angeles chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Kedren\u2019s problems are part of a mental health crisis that extends well beyond the facility. He cited a lack of resources, psychiatrists and accountability in the mental health system.\n\nLos Angeles has 23 psychiatric beds per 100,000 people, less than half of the 50 recommended by experts, according to a report released earlier this year by the California Hospital Assn.\n\n\u201cYou have a recipe for this type of disaster,\u201d Turner said.\n\nBut Dr. David Ruskin, who was chief psychiatrist at the county\u2019s Department of Mental Health during the inspections, said he believes the hospital has addressed the issues that led to Masters\u2019 death.\n\n\u201cIf, God forbid, one of my family members got sick, I would be comfortable having them go to Kedren,\u201d said Ruskin, who left the department in August.\n\nThe hospital has been the focus of retaliation claims by several former employees in recent years. In one 2016 case that led to out-of-court mediation, a nurse alleged that she was fired after reporting insurance fraud and a lack of basic safety training.\n\nAnd in a pending lawsuit, Brenda Hilliard alleged she was fired in April 2017 after reporting to a supervisor that a 12-year-old patient had been given medication without a prescription. A nurse with 34 years of experience, Hilliard alleged that nurses would routinely administer medication without consulting a doctor. Doctors would sign documentation the next day, making it seem that they had issued verbal orders for the medication, according to her lawsuit.\n\nKedren has denied each of these allegations in legal filings.\n\nSeven months after Hilliard was fired, police brought Masters to Kedren. He had left Oklahoma on a bus for California several months earlier on the eve of his 30th birthday, telling his mother he wanted to see the ocean.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what led to Masters\u2019 encounter with law enforcement, though the Redondo Beach Police Department confirmed that he was found at the city\u2019s public library. Masters was brought to Kedren and diagnosed with psychosis, according to hospital records reviewed by inspectors.\n\nHe had been there a week when 41-year-old Francisco Garcia was admitted to the hospital and bunked beside him. Garcia had attempted to cut himself with a knife and was psychotic and a danger to himself, according to hospital records reviewed by inspectors. But Garcia was never seen by a doctor or given psychiatric medication, according to the inspection report.\n\nSix hours after Garcia\u2019s admission, on the night of Nov. 2, 2017, staff members responded to a disturbance in the hallway outside Masters\u2019 room between Garcia and a third roommate, a nurse told inspectors. The roommate told the nurse that Garcia had killed Masters and was trying to kill him too.\n\nA bloodied Masters was found unresponsive, staff told inspectors. After attempts to resuscitate him failed, Masters was pronounced dead.\n\nThe inspection reports do not refer to Garcia by name. But he was arrested in connection with the killing and currently awaits trial. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn another pending lawsuit, filed late last year, a hospital employee alleges he reviewed security footage from that night and found that Masters\u2019 room was unattended for nearly three hours. The employee, Shahrooz Shahram, was the hospital\u2019s director of quality improvement.\n\nShahram\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Griffith was furious when he learned Shahram was investigating Masters\u2019 death and prevented him from meeting with county inspectors. A month after the killing, Shahram alleges, his office was ransacked and documents from the case went missing. His lawsuit claims that Griffith fired him in January, telling him he \u201cwas \u2018creating too many problems.\u2019\u201d\n\nShahram also alleges that records at the hospital were routinely forged and that it was \u201croutine practice to mistreat patients to the degree of abuse and neglect.\u201d The lawsuit describes an employee who threw a patient against a wall, leaving a dent. That same employee, the lawsuit claims, had been accused of engaging in sex with a patient and the accusation was never investigated.\n\nInspectors confirmed reports of assaults that appeared never to have been investigated.\n\nKedren has denied Shahram\u2019s allegations.\n\nThe hospital reported Masters\u2019 death to the California Department of Public Health, which conducted a six-month investigation. It found that the hospital had violated state regulations in failing to adequately assess and monitor Garcia.\n\nAccording to the hospital\u2019s chief of nursing, Garcia \u201cshould have been placed on constant observation\u201d because he had recently attempted suicide, investigators wrote in their report.\n\nSurveillance footage reviewed by inspectors showed no staff member entering the room between 8:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m., shortly before Masters was found. The chief of nursing confirmed to investigators that the room appeared unsupervised during that period.\n\nIn late July 2018, state and federal inspectors returned unannounced to the hospital. This time, they inspected the entire facility for compliance with federal regulations on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn addition to confirming lapses in Kedren\u2019s care of Masters and his roommates, this inspection uncovered other problems.\n\nInspectors discovered that neither the hospital\u2019s director of food services nor its infection control officer were formally trained for their roles; only two of the 10 food handlers were certified, in violation of the law.\n\nAfter declaring an emergency due to the \u201cpotential to cause food-borne illness including death to all 33 patients and staff,\u201d the inspector intervened and stopped reheated leftover chicken from being served, the report said.\n\nMasters\u2019 family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit, accusing the hospital of negligence for failing to monitor and evaluate his alleged attacker.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s credible evidence that Kedren did not monitor the room that Masters was in for an extended period of time, which violates their own policy and violates state law,\u201d said Brian Claypool, a Los Angeles civil rights lawyer representing the family.\n\nAlthough Kedren has yet to respond to the legal complaint filed by Masters\u2019 family, its lawyer said it intends to deny all of the allegations, just as it has done in each of the other lawsuits.\n\n\u201cEvery case has two sides,\u201d Kamel wrote in the email.\n\nGrowing up in Kansas, Masters dreamed of becoming a veterinarian, his mother, Melody Burkholder, said. But he struggled with bipolar disorder and eventually dropped out of high school. Medication eased his symptoms, but Masters was frequently hospitalized after neglecting to take it.\n\nAfter Masters left for California, he stayed in touch with Burkholder on Facebook and told her he was enjoying the beach and making new friends. But by the end of October 2017 his mental state had deteriorated. He was homeless and in the midst of a manic episode when he arrived at Kedren, according to a nurse at the hospital.\n\nWhen Burkholder first heard of her son\u2019s death, she was in disbelief. \u201cThe one place he thought would keep him safe turned out to be the one place on the planet where he was not,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt cost him his life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it cost me my son.\u201d\n\nLucas Manfield has covered healthcare, education and criminal justice in New York City and Dallas.
