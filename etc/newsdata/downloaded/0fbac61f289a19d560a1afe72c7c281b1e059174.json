When my husband offered to take the kids for a walk down the beach, I was grateful for a little time to catch up on my beach reading.\n\nWhen my husband returned, I was standing near the water\u2019s edge. Both kids were walking toward me and, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my son walk past me. I assumed he was headed to our beach blanket.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t, though.\n\nUnbeknown to us as we chatted about where to go for lunch, he kept walking in the other direction, along the water\u2019s edge, unaware that his father had stopped to talk to me.\n\nIn a split second, our lives changed. We couldn\u2019t find our son in the sea of sunbathers and beach games. With terror rising in my chest, I started screaming for him and, thankfully, other beach goers quickly jumped in to help us look.\n\nWe eventually found him, well down the beach, sitting with a kindly elderly couple, holding a huge ice cream cone they\u2019d bought for him when they realised he was panicked he couldn\u2019t find his parents. We gratefully (and tearfully) thanked them and, when I asked him what he did when he realised we were gone, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know who to ask for help, Mummy.\u201d\n\nI realised I needed to give my son a concrete way to look for help in the event he was separated from us again.\n\nKeep Your Daredevil Toddler Safe The toddler years are a time of conflicting objectives: on one hand, these young children want to see, do, and climb everything; on the other hand, parents want these children to survive.

And for some children, an officer\u2019s uniform can seem frightening or overwhelming.\n\nI needed to give my son a reference point he\u2019d understand, even at his young age. So I told him that if he was ever lost or separated from me again, he should look for a mum or dad with a stroller (or another parent with young kids in a grocery cart).\n\nSmall children all recognise that strollers are usually accompanied by mums or dads with small children. A stroller is easy to spot and is often a comforting, familiar sight for a little one.\n\nAs a mother who has helped her fair share of scared kids at the pool, grocery store and community events, I know, too, that my stroller was always loaded with hand wipes, extra bottled water, and comforting toys, books and other items that can help a scared child.\n\nOf course, no parent wants to lose their child in a department store, but the fact is that kids are fast \u2014 in a split second, they can wander off and become truly lost.\n\nTelling your child to look for a stroller if they are ever scared or alone will help them focus in what could be a scary few minutes. In the unlikely event that you can\u2019t get to your child quickly, a parent with a stroller will always know just what to do to help your child find a safe place to wait for you.\n\nTeach Your Kids The Difference Between Danger And Risk For part of my childhood, from about 9 to 13 years old, I lived in a house with a creek just beyond its backyard. I\u2019d go down to my friend\u2019s house on the corner and we\u2019d \u201ccreek-walk\u201d our way up the street and around our neighbourhood.

While in the ladies\u2019 room, I noticed, you guessed it, a mum with a stroller who was struggling to finish changing her little one\u2019s nappy. I smiled and offered to entertain the baby while she, a fellow conference attendee, washed her hands and cleaned the changing table area.\n\nAfter we walked out of the bathroom, we realised were both headed to the hotel restaurant, and she smiled and said, \u201cWould you like to join me for lunch?\u201d\n\nTurns out we were both feeling a little lost, and I was never so grateful to see a mum with a stroller.", "description": "When my son was four, my husband and I took him and his then two-year-old sister to spend the day on a Florida beach.
