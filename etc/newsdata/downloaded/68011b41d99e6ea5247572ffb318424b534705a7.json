Against a basket of currencies the dollar hit a month low of 97.898 overnight and was steady around that level on Thursday.\n\nThe Aussie jumped to $0.6786 after figures showed joblessness unexpectedly contracting a bit last month, taking some pressure off the central bank to further reduce interest rates in November.\n\n\"This is just what the doctor ordered,\" said CBA Chief Economist Craig James.\n\n\"There is no reason for the Reserve Bank to cut rates again in November \u2014 giving the central bank more time to gauge the effectiveness of early rate reductions.\"\n\nLingering worries about trade tensions between the United States and China kept a lid on gains for trade-exposed currencies.\n\nReports of a partial trade deal between the world's two largest economies last week initially cheered markets, but a lack of details on the agreement has since curbed enthusiasm.\n\n\"Even if a deal is signed, it remains uncertain if the obligations can be fully met on both sides,\" strategists at Singapore's DBS Bank said in a note.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar was lower, following dovish comments from a top central banker on Wednesday, and sits at $0.6287, not far from a four-year low hit two weeks ago.\n\nChina's yuan weakened slightly to 7.0975 per dollar.", "description": "The dollar drifted lower on Thursday after lackluster U.S. retail data and gathering doubts about a U.S.-China trade deal, while the volatile pound was on edge as Britain and the European Union scrambled to secure a last-minute Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105170104-GettyImages-844285300.jpg?v=1571271575", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
