Saudi Arabia is the world's top oil\n\nexporter and has been the supplier of last resort for decades.\n\nBrent crude was down 36 cents, or 0.5%, at $68.66 a\n\nbarrel at 0930 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate was down\n\n57 cents, or 0.9%, at $62.33 a barrel. Earlier, the crude\n\nbenchmarks both fell by around 2%.\n\nOn Monday, the prices surged nearly 20% in intraday trading\n\nin response to the attacks, the biggest jump in almost 30 years,\n\nbefore closing nearly 15% higher at four-month highs.\n\nSaudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman will hold\n\na news conference at 8.00 pm local time (1700 GMT).\n\nproducer Saudi Aramco has not given a\n\nspecific timeline for the resumption of full output.\n\n\"All eyes will be on the Saudi news conference,\" said Samuel\n\nCiszuk, founding partner at Stockholm-based ELS Analysis.\n\n\"We need a proper damage assessment, we need to see a\n\nrecovery plan. Before that, we don't really know how much oil\n\nwill be offline for how long and that's the basic question\n\npeople having been posing since Saturday.\"\n\nThe attacks on Saudi Aramco's crude-processing facilities at\n\nAbqaiq and Khurais cut production by 5.7 million barrels a day,\n\nthe largest single supply disruption in half a century, and\n\nthrew into question its status as supplier of last\n\nresort. The fallout in Asia, the largest buyer of Saudi crude, has\n\nbeen varied, with some refineries expected to receive their\n\nallocated volumes for October, and other importers being told of\n\ndelays or being offered alternative grades.\n\nThe prospect of oil releases from strategic inventories in\n\nthe United States, the International Energy Agency and some big\n\nbuying countries such as Japan have weighed on prices, but the\n\ngeopolitical threat of retaliation in the Middle East is causing\n\nconcerns.\n\n\"High stock levels mean that no shortage of supply is likely\n\n... On the other hand, there is a danger of further escalation,\n\nwhich would necessitate a substantial risk premium on the oil\n\nprice,\" Commerzbank oil analyst Carsten Fritsch said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday it looked like\n\nIran was behind attacks, but stressed he did not want to go to\n\nwar. Tehran has rejected the charges that it was behind the\n\ndrone strikes.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have\n\ndeteriorated since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord\n\nlast year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports.\n\nWashington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support\n\nfor regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces\n\nhave been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years. The\n\nHouthis claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks.\n\n\"It's not a great thing to say, but if something like this\n\nis going to happen, at least it happened at a time when there is\n\na surplus in crude and U.S. production is growing at such a fast\n\nclip,\" said Tony Nunan, Tokyo-based oil risk manager at\n\nMitsubishi Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Saudi Arabia crude oil exports by top destinations https://tmsnrt.rs/31tmGgz\n\nCHART: U.S. oil may retest resistance at $62.64 per barrel\n\nL3N2680L7\n\nCHART: Brent oil may retest resistance zone of $71.74-$72.66\n\nL3N268045\n\nGRAPHIC: Global oil prices pull back but remain jittery https://tmsnrt.rs/303OXwF\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 4-Oil slips as market assesses fallout from Saudi attack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
