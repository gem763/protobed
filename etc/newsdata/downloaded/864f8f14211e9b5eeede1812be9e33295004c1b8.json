Having gone into the weekend tied with Hamilton on four Singapore wins, the German is now the most successful driver outright in the city-state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy, great race,\u201d said the four-times world champion after the first one-two by any team on Singapore\u2019s street circuit.\n\n\u201cBig congratulations to the team, the start of the season was difficult for us but in the last weeks we\u2019ve come alive.\u201d\n\nThe early stop gave the German a fresh tyre boost that left Leclerc crestfallen when the Monegasque pitted from the lead and emerged just as Vettel swept past for a track advantage he never relinquished.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2026\u201d exclaimed Leclerc over the team radio, who made no secret of his displeasure in further comments.\n\n\u201cMy head is down and it will be down until the race (ends). I just want to let you know my feelings,\u201d he said during one of the night\u2019s three safety car periods.\n\n\u201cTo be completely honest with you, I don\u2019t understand at all the undercut,\u201d complained Leclerc, winner in Belgium and Italy and now joint third with Verstappen in the overall standings.\n\nBARRIER-LINED STREETS\n\nOnce ahead of his team mate, Vettel had little to worry about with Singapore\u2019s barrier-lined streets notoriously difficult to overtake on.\n\nOnly the safety car periods and slower cars yet to pit threatened to disrupt his rhythm but the German, whose temperament and future at Ferrari have been the subject of much speculation, kept his head.\n\nLeclerc radioed Ferrari asking for more power to mount an attack during the restarts but was not able to faze his team mate and agreed not to do anything stupid over the final laps.\n\nMercedes had been favourites going into the weekend but the champions, who started the year with five straight one-twos, were left licking their wounds.\n\nBehind the top five, British-born Thai rookie Alexander Albon was sixth for Red Bull.\n\nMcLaren\u2019s teenage rookie Lando Norris was seventh ahead of Toro Rosso\u2019s French driver Pierre Gasly. Nico Hulkenberg took ninth for Renault ahead of Antonio Giovinazzi, who rounded out the top 10 for Alfa Romeo.\n\nThe Italian was one of the last to pit and he and his team enjoyed a rare moment in the spotlight by leading for several laps.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nDanish driver Kevin Magnussen took the fastest lap for Haas for the second year in a row but without scoring an extra point \u2014 available only for those in the top 10 \u2014 because he finished 17th.\n\nThe safety car was first deployed after a tangle between Haas\u2019s Romain Grosjean and Williams\u2019 George Russell on lap 35 that left the Briton\u2019s car in the wall.\n\nIt came out again when Racing Point\u2019s Sergio Perez slowed and stopped while in 10th place and then finally after a collision between Toro Rosso\u2019s Daniil Kvyat and Alfa Romeo\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen.", "description": "Sebastian Vettel ended the torment of 13 months without a win by leading his complaining Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc across the line in a one-two finish at the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432683062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0MC", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
