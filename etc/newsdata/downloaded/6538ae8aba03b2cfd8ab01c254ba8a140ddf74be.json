(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nWhen pushed by Checkup host Duncan McCue on whether Singh's comments in support of Trump's impeachment would sour the leader's relationship with Washington, Singh doubled down.\n\n\"We're longtime friends with the States and if the president is doing something wrong, I think a good friend is expected to say, 'Hey, it's wrong what you're doing,' and to be able to call that out,\" he said.\n\nComparing climate plans\n\nEmma Eaton calling from Whitehorse pressed Singh on whether the NDP's plan to fight climate change goes far enough, compared with the Green Party plan.\n\nThe NDP says that it would like to cut emissions by roughly 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nThe Green Party platform includes a 60 per cent reduction over 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nLISTEN: Checkup caller pushes Singh about his support of LNG extraction\n\nCross Country Checkup caller Aaron Keogh pushes NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to clarify whether or not he supports the LNG development in British Columbia. 4:05\n\nSingh says that independent experts have called the NDP's plan the \"best plan of all parties.\"\n\nSupporting rural youth\n\nWhen it comes to employment for young Canadians, Singh says that his party's infrastructure investments will create jobs in rural regions.\n\nCalling from Sydney, N.S., Natasha Kothhar asked Singh how he would keep young Canadians like herself in their home communities.\n\n\"What I believe in is when you use public dollars to invest in infrastructure, that's how you can create great jobs and also help a community out with better infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nSingh says that the NDP's plan to retrofit homes to be more environmentally friendly, build housing, and invest in public transit will all contribute to local economies.\n\nHe adds that improving broadband internet access in rural areas is also necessary.\n\n\"We know that a lot of jobs, and a lot of companies, could set up in communities that are rural if they had access to high speed internet.\"\n\nCross Country Checkup has requested Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer also participate in Ask Me Anything segments.
