REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\n\u201cWe are still ready to work on any new legal and operational proposal from the UK,\u201d Barnier told reporters on arriving for talks on Brexit with European lawmakers.\n\nBarnier declined to comment on the political crisis in Britain, where parliament resumed in an acrimonious session on Wednesday after the Supreme Court ruled Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended it unlawfully.\n\nBarnier also told EU ambassador envoys that the bloc was still waiting for \u201cworkable ideas\u201d, according to a diplomat briefed on the meeting.\n\nAnother said the envoys were \u201chighly sceptical\u201d that a deal can be had and that British proposals to replace the so-called backstop provision in the divorce treaty were \u201cfar from solving the border conundrum\u201d on the island of Ireland.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk told Johnson in New York this week that Britain had a last chance to present serious and detailed proposals immediately after the Conservative Party conference beginning on Sunday, the sources said.\n\nOtherwise there would not be enough time to agree a deal and EU leaders would not negotiate with Britain at an EU summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18, they added.\n\nJohnson insists he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal.\n\nBritain submitted its fourth technical paper to the EU this week, with proposals on customs arrangements after Brexit, diplomatic sources told Reuters, as London seeks to replace the Irish border backstop.\n\nBLAME GAME\n\nBut the EU says London\u2019s ideas so far - on food and animal checks, customs and regulatory controls, checks on manufactured goods and market surveillance, among others - fall short and are not acceptable as alternatives.\n\nA third diplomat, who is familiar with the UK proposal, said it was not operational, would amount to the \u201cdisintegration\u201d of EU checks on its external borders and create risks for the bloc\u2019s cherished single market.\n\nThe backstop is anathema for many in Britain as it could tie the country to the EU\u2019s trading rules for years to maintain an open Irish border and at the same time ensure the necessary controls between the bloc and Britain after they split.\n\nPhilippe Lamberts, a liberal EU lawmaker from Belgium, spared Johnson no criticism as he arrived for the meeting with Barnier.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not seeking a solution because a solution would mean first finding a compromise with the European Union, then building compromise in Westminster (the UK parliament) to pass an agreement,\u201d Lamberts told reporters.\n\n\u201cSo maybe his strategy is another one and I believe it has been all along ... to provoke a no-deal Brexit but in a way that would allow him to blame others - either Brussels or Westminster.\u201d", "description": "Britain has yet to provide \"legal and operational\" proposals that could break the impasse over its departure from the European Union, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Jorrit Donner-Wittkopf", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434269053&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0EL", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
