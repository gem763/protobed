The Pentagon has ordered additional U.S. troops to be deployed in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia's air and missile defenses.\n\nBritain believes Iran was responsible for the attack and will work with the United States and European allies on a joint response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday. The United States and Saudi Arabia have already blamed Iran, which denies responsibility.\n\nThe Saudi attacks have refocused investor attention on the prospect of other supply disruptions in other OPEC producers like Nigeria, Libya and Venezuela. Investors had been less concerned about supply risks due to ample supplies.\n\n\"The geopolitical risk premium has returned with a vengeance and supply-side developments have been thrust back into the spotlight,\" Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM said.\n\n\"While Saudi oil facilities smolder, the potential for fresh outages in Nigeria, Libya and Venezuela continues to hang over the market.\"\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nOil falls below $64 on Saudi oil restart prospects, economy concerns\n\nSaudi Arabia to restore full oil output by next week: source\n\nNewsBreak: Oil Falls on Reports Saudi Production to be Restored by Next Week", "description": "Investing.com - Oil prices turned lower on Monday, retracing early gains following reports that top exporter Saudi Arabia is due to restore oil production as soon as next week, while signs of weakness in Europe\u2019s economy also weighed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
