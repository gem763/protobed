These are five features that can't be benchmarked but have an undeniable impact on productivity.\n\nIf you can't wait for Microsoft's big Surface unveil on Wednesday, well-known leaker Evan Blass has posted what he says are product shots of the Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 3, and the Arm-powered Surface.\n\nMicrosoft's hardware gurus are gearing up for the big Surface event in New York City, but it looks like a big chunk of its event has been leaked to Blass, who's attracted a huge following on Twitter because of his track record in reliably leaking accurate images and details about upcoming smartphones.\n\nHe shared images of the Arm-powered Surface 2-in-1, the 13-inch and 15-inch Surface Laptop 3, and the Surface Pro 7 2-in-1.\n\nDespite the massive Surface leak, there's still some mystery around the long-rumored dual-screen Surface. Blass notes that a dual-screen Surface is \"not pictured here\".\n\nMicrosoft is building a dual-screen laptop, codenamed 'Centaurus'. As ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley reported last week, the dual-screen Surface is one of the first devices that could run on Windows Lite OS, Microsoft's answer to ChromeOS.\n\nImage: Ivan Blass/Twitter\n\nHowever, Foley thinks it's unlikely that Microsoft will discuss Lite OS at the Wednesday event, and her sources say the dual-screen device is more likely to be a 2020 product, though Microsoft could reveal a prototype this week.\n\nMicrosoft's Surface team showed off the dual-screen device to employees in June, suggesting it could soon release it.\n\nThe images do line up with Foley's expectation that Microsoft is planning to reveal several Surface devices, including a Qualcomm 8cx-based Surface Arm 4G device priced around $999. Microsoft is also expected to unveil an AMD-based Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro with USB-C.\n\nMicrosoft may also use Wednesday's event to announce when it plans to ship the HoloLens 2, which it has already confirmed will cost $3,500.\n\nThe new Surface line-up follows last year's Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2, Surface Studio and Surface headphones.\n\nMore on Microsoft's new devices and products", "description": "Photos of Microsoft's new Surface laptops leak ahead of Wednesday's big Surface event in New York City.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/01/4343f26d-345c-40b9-b09a-f5224d0bd10b/thumbnail/770x578/16add950637d389da4ff7df566f942f5/microsoftarmsurfaceoct19b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
