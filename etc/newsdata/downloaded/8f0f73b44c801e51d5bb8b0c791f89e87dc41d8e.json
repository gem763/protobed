They hold placards in the style of a cigarette packet which reads 'climate change is harmful to your health' and wear their NHS lanyards\n\nThere are around 100,000 people on the Extinction Rebellion database across the UK and about one million have been reached through social media.\n\nFifty-nine countries are taking part in the environmental movements and 130 groups are in operation in the UK, claimed the eco-warrior.\n\n'We are killing life on Earth, we're in the sixth mass extinction event and it's possible that human beings will go extinct.
