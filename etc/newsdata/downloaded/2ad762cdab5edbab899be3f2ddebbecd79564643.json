We need more time.\u201d\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a deal was possible but that much more work was needed.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cA deal is possible, and it\u2019s possible this month, may even be possible this week. But we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to do, so I hope that we can make more progress today.\u201d\n\nIt raises the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour deal.\n\nAt the State Opening of Parliament, the Queen\u2019s Speech stopped short of repeating Mr Johnson\u2019s explicit promise to leave the EU on Halloween come what may.\n\nMr Johnson faces a major Commons showdown when he returns to Westminster after the summit for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament, the first since the Falklands War.\n\nIf he fails to get a deal, he is expected to ask MPs to vote on a no deal Brexit . Opposition MPs could also attempt to table a vote on a second referendum.\n\n(Image: JESSICA TAYLOR/UK PARLIAMENT HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nBut No 10 said Mr Johnson would not resign if MPs voted down the Queen\u2019s Speech next week - and could even plough on and introduce the bills regardless.\n\nTalks are continuing in Brussels but time is rapidly running out if there is to be a deal to put to leaders to sign off at their crunch summit later this week.\n\nThere are also concerns that any deal would not get through Parliament - and if it did, that there would not be enough time to get the laws through before the deadline.\n\nRebel ex-Tory Nick Boles said: \u201cMPs will want to scrutinise the legislation that implements our withdrawal very closely and ensure that an extension is secured if there is any chance that this legislation will not have completed its passage before October 31.\u201d\n\nBut No 10 ruled out extending Brexit by a couple of weeks if a deal looked in sight - even if just for a technical extension.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m generally not aware such a thing even exists. The PM is clear that we leave on October 31st,\u201d the PM\u2019s official spokesman said.\n\nNo 10 claimed there would be enough time to get a deal through Parliament.\n\n\u201cThe public would expect Parliament to work round the clock in order to pass that legislation to leave on October 31,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Johnson is believed to have proposed a customs plan that would see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK, as well as an assurance that no one community could have a veto.\n\nBut the PM risked being boxed in by his DUP allies who warned they would \u201cnot be eating our own words\u201d over their opposition to the province staying tied to the EU - as Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested he may have to do.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker suggested the EU would agree to another delay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Brits to decide if they will ask for an extension,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut if Boris Johnson were to ask for extra time \u2014 which probably he won\u2019t \u2014 I would consider it unhistoric to refuse such a request.\u201d", "description": "Negotiations are set to go down to the wire - with the UK and Brussels still trying to thrash out a compromise on Northern Ireland", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Pool Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters", "Jessica Taylor Uk Parliament Handout Epa-Efe Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581156.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
