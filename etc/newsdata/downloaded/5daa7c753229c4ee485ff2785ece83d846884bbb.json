That's just cruel. To make matters worse the Saints go marching north to face City twice in a week - once in the cup and once in the league.\n\nCity are the tournament holders and will be in no mood to show mercy on their wounded visitors as they look to retain it this season.\n\n'I don't think they [Southampton] will be full of confidence, so they might be defending really deep, with a lot of passion,' Ilkay Gundogan said after victory over Aston Villa at the weekend.\n\n'We need to be prepared, we need to be ready to play them a couple of times in a row. The first time is already a final, obviously we want to go through the next round. It's not going to be easy, especially for their last result. They will probably want to prove to everyone that they are not a bad team.'\n\nDefend like they did against Leicester and City could produce a cricket score.\n\nSouthampton's leaky defence faces the daunting prospect of having to go against Man City\n\nSolskjaer ready to give kids a chance against Chelsea\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has not been shy to put his faith in United's academy stars so far and that is not going to change at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.\n\nHis predecessors have often reverted to tried and tested players for a game the size of United-Chelsea - not Solskjaer.\n\nJames Garner, 18, is set to get the nod in central midfield with 19-year-old Brandon Williams also widely expected to make an appearance from the start.\n\nInjuries have seen academy prospects thrust into the first-team squad and while he has few other options, Solskjaer has hailed their impact so early in their careers.\n\nChelsea are a different proposition to the one that got beaten 4-0 at Old Trafford at the start of the season, Garner, Williams and Co face one of their toughest tests to date.\n\nJames Garner, 18, is set to win a starting berth in Manchester United's midfield away at Chelsea\n\nWill Xhaka make the trip to Anfield after 'f*** off' jibe at fans?\n\nThis is the question on everyone's lips following the fall-out from the 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace.\n\nIt remains unclear if the Swiss international will be stripped of the captaincy but, should he lead the Gunners out in the face of adversity against Liverpool on Wednesday, the reception he gets would be essential viewing.\n\nFormer Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit called Xhaka's behaviour a 'betrayal' while some of his team-mates feel the reaction has been over-the-top.\n\nUnai Emery's man-management has never been needed more than it is this week with his captain.\n\nWhether he plays, is benched, or is left out entirely, Xhaka is the one everyone will look for when the teams are announced at Anfield.\n\nThe issue surrounding Granit Xhaka is one of the biggest talking points ahead of Liverpool\n\nMarco Silva under pressure against old side\n\nGiven the precarious position he currently finds himself in, Marco Silva cannot afford to get knocked out of the cup on Tuesday night.\n\nHe particularly cannot lose at home, against his former employers Watford.\n\nSilva insisted this week that 'it is not a moment to hide' and with supporters crying out for some silverware, the Carabao Cup is a real opportunity for a meaningful cup run.\n\nAfter a demoralising defeat to Brighton at the weekend, Silva needs any sort of win to ease the pressure.\n\nAn attacking masterclass would be nice, but a scrappy 1-0? Silva would no doubt snap your hand off for any route to the last-eight.\n\nWith pressure mounting on Marco Silva, he needs to appease critics with a win in the cup\n\nCan lowest-ranked side Crawley continue to defy the odds?\n\nIt may not have been the glamour tie either side wanted but League Two pair Crawley Town and Colchester United know they have a real opportunity to reach the quarter-finals.\n\nWhile Colchester are three points better off in the league, Crawley are thriving in the cup this season and are now on their third straight home game after wins against Premier League Norwich and Championship strugglers Stoke.\n\nOne thing Gabriele Cioffi's side have always been able to do in these one-off ties is keep it tight - a 1-0 win over Norwich was followed by a 5-3 penalty shootout win over Stoke.\n\nFans have been crying out for a glamour tie on the road. Overcome their lowest-ranked opponent to date and they will be just 180 minutes from a Wembley final.\n\nDare to dream.\n\nCrawley Town are continuing to upset the odds as their remarkable cup run continues to roll on\n\nGiant-killers Burton fancy their chances against Leicester\n\nBournemouth came full of hope for a cup run, only to leave with their tail firmly between their legs.\n\nNow, back at home for another cup game, Burton will be determined to repeat their opposition disappearing act when Brendan Rodgers' free-scoring Leicester come to the Pirelli Stadium.\n\nLeicester are heavy favourites and Rodgers, given his side played on Friday night, got a good look at Nigel Clough's side in their 1-0 win over AFC Wimbledon.\n\nWith no pressure on Burton, stranger things have happened (provided they do not follow Ralph Hasenhuttl's Southampton in the art of defending).\n\nBurton Albion knocked out Bournemouth in round three and are sensing another scalp at home\n\nNeedle in the Midlands as Villa take on Wolves\n\nThis one will have the needle and toxicity that none of the other games will have this week.\n\nTwo local rivals going head-to-head in front of a packed out Villa Park.\n\nOn their day both will believe they can get the better of their neighbour. Wolves' rise has seen them enter - and compete - in the Europa League. For Villa, while they made a slow start after promotion to the Premier League, appear to have found their feet.\n\nThe referee best remember his cards because under the lights, with bragging rights at stake, this one could see some crunching tackles going in.\n\nNot one for the faint-hearted.\n\nThere will be plenty of spice at Villa Park when Aston Villa welcome local rivals Wolves\n\nFernandinho suspension leaves City short at the back\n\nDespite City seemingly having an embarrassment of riches, Pep Guardiola is facing something of a defensive crisis right now.\n\nFernandinho, who himself has had to slot in at centre back due to mounting injuries, was sent off against Aston Villa on Saturday and will have to sit out the midweek visit of Southampton.\n\nAymeric Laporte is a long-term absentee, Rodri has recently joined him in the treatment room and Fernandinho now faces a spell on the sidelines.\n\nJohn Stones recently returned but appears not to have won the trust of Guardiola and Nicholas Otamendi remains a liability.\n\nIf Southampton are going to get any joy at all, they need to go all-in on City's weak spot.\n\nFernandinho's red card on Saturday leaves Pep Guardiola (left) short of defensive options\n\nSunderland fly the flag for the north east\n\nThose in the north east have had little to cheer for some time.\n\nThe entertaining - maybe not if you're a Sunderland fan - Netflix documentary captured the recent demise of a club now languishing in League One.\n\nManager Jack Ross has gone and with Phil Parkinson in charge, there is optimism that the Stadium of Light can witness some success in the league and the cups.\n\nAn away trip to Oxford United stands between Parkinson's side and a quarter-final spot and with Newcastle floundering and Gateshead and Hartlepool struggling, the north east are overdue some success.\n\nSunderland are flying the flag for the north east and will be confident away to Oxford United\n\nLampard ready for revenge after Old Trafford rout\n\nA lot has changed since the opening weekend of the season. For a start, Frank Lampard's Chelsea would not get turned over 4-0 away at Old Trafford if the sides played that same fixture again.\n\nThe silver lining for Lampard is that he can exact revenge against United on Wednesday night by knocking them out of the Carabao Cup.\n\nChelsea are one of the form sides in the country right now, with seven wins in a row after victories against Grimsby, Brighton, LOSC Lille, Southampton, Newcastle, Ajax and Burnley.\n\nCompetition for places is bringing out the best in a young and exciting Chelsea squad and while they must defend better than they did at Old Trafford, the Blues have the wind in their sails right now.", "description": "The Carabao Cup returns on Tuesday and League Two Crawley (left) will look to continue their unlikely run to the latter stages, while Frank Lampard (right) will eye revenge against Man United.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20319554-0-image-a-42_1572344195648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
