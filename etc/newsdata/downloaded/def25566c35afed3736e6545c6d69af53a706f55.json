Stand With Hong Kong.\" \u2014 had \u201cdeeply offended\u201d the league\u2019s Chinese fans and did not represent the views of the Rockets or NBA.\n\nThe full statement:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\n\nThe statement came amid a massive financial backlash against the Rockets in China, and was a clear attempt to isolate the controversy to Morey without punishing him, lest the retaliation reach the rest of the league.\n\nSeveral politicians weren't happy with the NBA's handling of a pro-Hong Kong tweet from Rockets GM Daryl Morey.

Among the league\u2019s defenders was new Brooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai, the only Chinese majority owner in the NBA.\n\nPoliticians denounce NBA\u2019s statement on China and Rockets GM\n\nNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom.\n\n\n\nI stand with the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democratic rights.\n\n\n\nI stand with Americans who want to voice their support for the people of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nUnacceptablehttps://t.co/5B5KMGZujh \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 7, 2019\n\nAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nNow, in pursuit of big $$, the @nba is shamefully retreating. https://t.co/7waMde5KrM \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nChina is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. https://t.co/87U4jgsAAp \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 7, 2019\n\nJuli\u00e1n, glad to agree with you on this one. https://t.co/0V7PHY1iIW \u2014 Senator John Cornyn (@JohnCornyn) October 7, 2019\n\nThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment. https://t.co/bbiwCBTwc1 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 7, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the @NBA is more interested in money than human rights. Tonight\u2019s statement from Commissioner Silver is an absolute joke.\n\n\n\nThe NBA is kowtowing to Beijing to protect their bottom line and disavowing those with the temerity to #standwithHongKong. Shameful! https://t.co/RBPJa04xzK \u2014 Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) October 7, 2019\n\nThis is a mistake that they should fix quickly. https://t.co/qNmKNTdksV \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) October 7, 2019\n\nThousands in Hong Kong are peacefully protesting in support of the same freedom of speech that makes America great. Meanwhile, the NBA seems more worried about losing business than standing up for freedom.\n\n\n\nShameful. \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) October 7, 2019\n\n.@BenSasse now weighs in on the NBA: \u201cThe NBA issued a statement saying money is the most important thing.\u201d pic.twitter.com/UgIMj3Uubl \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 7, 2019\n\nThe NBA is standing with the authoritarian Chinese government as they suppress democracy and shoot people in the street. I stand with the people of Hong Kong. https://t.co/QcUznmkpyx \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 7, 2019\n\n.@NBA is throwing the GM of @HoustonRockets under the bus to please the Communist Chinese Govt.\n\n\n\nDisgusting.\n\n\n\nThey allow #China to punish a U.S. citizen for free speech in order to protect NBA\u2019s market access in China.\n\n\n\nGrotesquehttps://t.co/77lMHTGZyw \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\n.@NBA = no backbone, apparently. Very sad to see the league sell out #HongKong for the $$ https://t.co/z5sHwNd8L1 \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) October 7, 2019\n\nDisappointed @NBA would cow to the pressure of China's authoritarian regime. Employees should be able to speak freely in support of freedom and democracy abroad, not just in the US. Spreading basketball abroad is about values, not just cash. The Chinese people deserve better. \u2014 Jackie Speier (@RepSpeier) October 7, 2019\n\nChinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to \u201cbridge cultural divides\u201d? Cultural divides? https://t.co/d6jXQOzb5F \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 7, 2019\n\nDaryl Morey is right. We have an obligation to stand with Hong Kong and hold the CCP accountable for its gross violations of human rights. His willingness to speak the truth is a great embodiment of the @NBA\u2019s global social responsibility campaign. https://t.co/eAdpxCpPJi \u2014 Rep. Mike Gallagher (@RepGallagher) October 6, 2019\n\nListen....some things are more important than money. Like doing the right thing. @dmorey tweeted about human rights and supporting #HongKongProtests. How ironic that you\u2019re siding with communism to advance your greed. https://t.co/RoyJ3o3bbY \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) October 7, 2019\n\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also voiced her opinion by retweeting a post calling the NBA\u2019s handling of the matter as \u201cshameful and cannot stand.\u201d\n\nSenator request meeting with Adam Silver\n\nFlorida senator Rick Scott took the condemnation a step forward Monday morning by announcing that he is requesting a meering with NBA commissioner Adam Silver to discuss the league\u2019s involvement in China.\n\nWe must put human rights above profit. And that means standing with #HongKong. The NBA\u2019s refusal to denounce Communist China is shameful.\n\n\n\nI'm requesting a meeting with @NBA Commissioner Silver to discuss the importance of supporting the brave individuals fighting for freedom. pic.twitter.com/ky21Qhw6HT \u2014 Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) October 7, 2019\n\nNets owner weighs in on Morey situation\n\nIn a lengthy open letter, Tsai defends the anger directed against Morey as a product of a painful Chinese history, which should apparently allow them to treat Hong Kong protesters as a \u201cseparatist movement\u201d that must be suppressed. He questionably claims that \u201c1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country's sovereignty over homeland.\u201d\n\nTsai also says Morey apologized for the tweet, which is untrue. Morey merely said he did not intend to offend Chinese fans and that the tweet doesn\u2019t represent the Rockets and NBA.\n\nNEW: The new owner of the Nets, Joe Tsai, has issued an open letter about the Morey situation: https://t.co/JZAy7EERQg pic.twitter.com/ffVgJMQ3Qx \u2014 Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 7, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Politicians from both sides of the aisle had harsh words for an NBA statement attempting to distance the league from Rockets GM Daryl Morey's pro-Hong Kong tweet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OOzQ9QWmQj_jnZ_.2tQhvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTYuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ta54sJnZsp9hioiZfB6d5A--~B/aD0yNTkyO3c9Mzg3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/944cbab0-e8b2-11e9-8fee-51eed8996c35", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
