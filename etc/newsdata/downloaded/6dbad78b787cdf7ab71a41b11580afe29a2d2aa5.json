The inquiry was spurred by a whistleblower report that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate potential 2020 presidential opponent Joe Biden and his son.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump also confirmed Tuesday that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, but said that this was because of his view that the U.S. was contributing more to the country than were other European nations.\n\nTrump said he has authorized the release of the full, unredacted transcript of his call with Zelensky, which the White House is expected to release sometime Wednesday. The whistleblower could testify before Congress as soon as this week, according to a Twitter post from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Tuesday.\n\n\u2018Unique context\u2019\n\nThe overhang of a formal impeachment inquiry has injected further uncertainty into markets, contributing to the S&P 500\u2019s steepest loss since August on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, most have pointed out that the impeachment process could take months to unfold, and that the likelihood of it furthering past the Republican-majority Senate remains dubious.\n\n\u201cThere is no change to overall investment recommendations, which are only moderately cyclical given previous geopolitical and now political constraints on the business and profit cycles,\u201d JPMorgan analyst John Normand wrote in a note.\n\nTraders work before the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

He highlighted \u201cwildcards\u201d that have arisen as a result of the inquiry, including added uncertainty around U.S.-China trade and U.S.-Iran relations, as well as for the 2020 presidential and Senate elections.\n\nHistory provides little indication as to the direction of the stock market amid a presidential impeachment inquiry. The two previous incidences \u2013 during the Nixon and Clinton administrations \u2013 yielded two different results.\n\n\u201cDuring the Nixon saga, stocks were already tumbling (of course, we were going into recession) and kept falling after the formal inquiry process started,\u201d Neil Dutta, Renaissance Macro Research head of economics, wrote in an email. \u201cDuring the Clinton impeachment process, markets exploded to the upside as the economy boomed. Perhaps these political events are eventually overwhelmed by the fundamentals?\u201d\n\nMark your calendars! More\n\n\u2014\n\nEmily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
