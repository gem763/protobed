The ruling was a blow to activists who have been fighting to preserve the internet\u2019s status as a telephone service-like \u201ccommon carrier.\u201d But it handed them one major victory: the FCC can\u2019t preemptively stop states from adopting their own, stricter rules. And by doing so, it may be opening a new chapter in the fight for net neutrality.\n\nThe Mozilla v. FCC ruling slogs through a vast range of frequently convoluted arguments, sometimes hinging on strange questions like \u201cCan a smart washing machine make phone calls?\u201d But the section on state laws is comparatively straightforward. The FCC\u2019s 2018 \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom Order\u201d preemptively banned state or local rules that \u201cimpose more stringent requirements for any aspect of broadband service that we address in this order.\u201d The FCC argued that this fairly prevented a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of inconsistent regulations. The court disagreed.\n\nThe ruling says that Congress hasn\u2019t given the FCC direct authority for such sweeping control over local law, and the FCC can\u2019t simply say the rule serves some indirect purpose like promoting competition. Finally, the court accuses the FCC of trying to have its cake and eat it, too: the agency repealed net neutrality by reclassifying ISPs to reduce its authority over them, then granted itself power over states... using the old classification it had just rejected. (This is exactly what some legal experts predicted might happen.)\n\nThe FCC will need to specifically explain how a state law undermines its rules\n\nNotably, the FCC can still object to individual state laws. But it can\u2019t declare that any stricter laws automatically violate its rules. \u201cIf the Commission can explain how a state practice actually undermines the 2018 order, then it can invoke conflict preemption,\u201d explains the ruling. \u201cIf it cannot make that showing, then presumably the two regulations can coexist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the 34 states that have already introduced or passed net neutrality rules. The most prominent of these is California, which passed what the Electronic Frontier Foundation dubbed a \u201cgold standard\u201d bill last year. The California rule not only bans blocking and throttling, but also stops ISPs from zero-rating specific apps like Netflix, which gives them a leg up by exempting them from data caps. But the Justice Department sued to stop its enforcement, and the rules have been on hold since last year \u2014 waiting for a resolution of their legal status.\n\nThe recent ruling doesn\u2019t put California in the clear yet. But a spokesperson for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told the Los Angeles Times that it creates \u201csolid ground\u201d for a defense in court. And the bill\u2019s sponsor, California Senator Scott Wiener, wrote in a statement that he was \u201cthrilled\u201d about the ruling on state law. \u201cAs a result of this decision, California\u2019s net neutrality law ... remains fully intact and the most impactful net neutrality law in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FCC majority has maintained that this decision won\u2019t stop it from shutting down state rules \u2014 it will just have to make more specific arguments about their contents. Conservative Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly, who celebrated the overall decision, portrayed it as more of a headache than an existential threat, warning that the decision would lead to \u201ccase-by-case preemption efforts and more litigation.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is gearing up for a legal battle\n\nOpponents argue that the FCC has hamstrung itself by taking such a hands-off approach to internet regulation. \u201cThe court made it very difficult for the FCC to argue that a state law would conflict with federal regulations, because the FCC has repealed most of the substantive rules,\u201d said Eric Null, senior policy council at New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute, said in a Reddit Q&A.\n\nIf California and other states win their legal challenges, that doesn\u2019t just protect residents in those states; it makes maintaining a blanket throttling policy much more difficult. Conversely, though, it means having dozens of fights (in state congressional chambers and the courts) over net neutrality \u2014 and creating a potentially confusing spread of rules across the country.\n\nSo the ultimate solution, for net neutrality advocates, is still national legislation. Several US Congress members, including Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), used this decision to promote the Save the Internet Act \u2014 a bill that would reinstate the FCC\u2019s old net neutrality rules. The Save the Internet Act passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, but it\u2019s been stymied in the Senate.\n\nThis legal saga isn\u2019t over yet. Mozilla seems likely to appeal this week\u2019s decision, although a spokesperson said it was still considering its next steps. The FCC could also appeal over the state preemption section. But it suggests that we\u2019ll start seeing the fight for net neutrality heat up at a local level \u2014 whether or not it ultimately stays there.", "description": "A legal decision this week affirmed that the FCC could repeal net neutrality rules, but activists have been energized by the potential to pass state laws.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/spipOGtniEaU6AtMKBwZIrmRA8k=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11515083/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
