On Monday, it barely moved, inching along about 14 miles in 11 hours. Such slow movement meant that the Bahamas stayed within Dorian's eyewall, the strongest part of the hurricane, for over a day, which few places on Earth have ever experienced.\n\nIt's moved north now, but at least seven people have been killed, neighborhoods and roads have been flooded, and thousands of homes are ruined.\n\nThese photos show what the damage from Dorian is like in the Bahamas.\n\nBusinesses in Florida and the Bahamas boarded up in preparation for Hurricane Dorian. When the storm hit the Bahamas Sunday it was a Category 5, and tied for the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record.\n\nADAM DELGIUDICE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSources: Insider, The New York Times, ABC News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis storm hasn't been easy to forecast, and it's unusual for one to hover over a country the way that it has, leaving unfathomable flooding and damage in its wake.\n\nAP Photo/Ramon Espinosa\n\nSources: Insider, The New York Times, ABC News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFew places on Earth have experienced being inside the eyewall of a Category 4 or 5 storm for so long, according to the Washington Post.
