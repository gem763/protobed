WaPo, Hollywood, Nats fans show self-defeating toxicity of US politics", "language": "en", "text": "American media, celebrities and coastal elites are so far gone in their obsession with President Donald Trump, they are willing to praise Islamic State terrorists so long as they don\u2019t have to side with their president.\n\nMuch of America greeted Trump\u2019s announcement that US forces had tracked down and killed Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) \u201ccaliph\u201d Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi with joy and pride. What country would not rejoice in the demise of a leader of terrorists, head-choppers, rapists and murderers? Apparently, not the America of the mainstream media, Hollywood celebrities, and even many Washington, DC residents \u2013 all of whom simply could not resist to bash Trump instead.\n\nAlso on rt.com WaPo blasted with #WaPoDeathNotices memes for dubbing ISIS leader \u2018austere religious scholar\u2019 in head-scratching headline\n\nThe Washington Post been rightly mocked for describing Baghdadi as an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d in a headline, but their other stories spinning his death as anything but a win for Trump flew largely under the radar. That doesn\u2019t mean other mainstream outlets covered themselves with glory. Apparently hating the very idea of giving Trump credit, they looked far and wide to find something, anything, they could hold against him.\n\nOne such thing was that he did not keep senior congressional Democrats in the loop about the operation. How dare he! They\u2019re only trampling law and precedent in trying to impeach him on fabricated charges, no big deal.\n\nThen there was this gem from National Public Radio, which chose to lead with Trump getting impeached and focused on \u201cdramatic and incendiary language.\u201d Oh, and by the way, Baghdadi died.\n\nPresident Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry over allegations that he abused his office to help himself politically, spoke in dramatic and incendiary language about the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. https://t.co/8KetHWzYzR \u2014 NPR (@NPR) October 28, 2019\n\nObjecting to Trump\u2019s mannerisms over the substance of his actions has long been a thing with the mainstream media, but this time it led to some truly bizarre reactions. Just like the time when Democrats and the media sided with the notorious MS-13 gang, just because Trump called them \u201canimals,\u201d they now objected to Trump\u2019s description of Baghdadi\u2019s death because they read it as somehow offensive to dogs.\n\n\u2018Halloween\u2019 star Jamie Lee Curtis, for example, tweeted that \u201cALL living things suffer when they are blown up,\u201d and that dogs are \u201cbrave, bold, loyal, loving and healing,\u201d not that Trump would understand.\n\nHe may have died a coward @realDonaldTrump but ALL living things suffer when they are blown up. Anyone who has experienced warfare, unlike yourself, would know that. War is brutal. Dogs are brave, bold, loyal, loving and healing. \u2014 Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) October 27, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201che died like a dog\u201d may have gone right over the heads of American liberals, but it was perfectly clear in the Muslim world, for which it was intended. Islam considers dogs unclean, and describing Al-Baghdadi that way diminished any claim to religious legitimacy he made as an \u201caustere scholar.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back around to the Post. Attempting to somehow excuse the headline, editor Kristine Kelly tweeted it \u201cshould have never read that way\u201d \u2013 getting an epic ratio in the process from a public that just wasn\u2019t buying it.\n\nDid WaPo just get the worst ratio ever? pic.twitter.com/RtW09JCgC6 \u2014 Austere Scholar Poso (@JackPosobiec) October 27, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s because the Post reportedly got it right the first time \u2013 calling Al-Baghdadi the \u201cIslamic State\u2019s terrorist-in-chief\u201d \u2013 and then inexplicably changed that headline to the controversial one, for reasons unknown.\n\nConfused celebrities, Resistance activists and political reporters all work and live in areas that overwhelmingly voted against Trump in 2016. A great example is the crowd at the Nationals Stadium in Washington, DC \u2013 which that booed Trump when he made an appearance at Sunday\u2019s World Series game.\n\nThe rest of America \u2013 the heartland Trump voters \u2013 saw a stadium filled with coastal liberals booing their president as he was doing the victory lap after killing Al-Baghdadi, and getting their karmic comeuppance when the Nats lost to the Houston Astros.\n\nSure, that had more to do with their star pitcher\u2019s injury than with Trump, but this is America, where narrative trumps facts, every time. One would think the Trump-haters would have got that message by now. Appears not.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
