(Photo: Submitted photo)\n\nA group of \"junior detectives\" helped California police find a 97-year-old woman who went missing.\n\nThe Roseville Police Department asked for the public's help in locating Glenneta Belford on Monday. Police said Belford has \"dementia and is mostly non-verbal\" and has \"been known to hide or hunker down in a location.\"\n\nLogan Hultman, 10, told USA TODAY that his friends Makenna Rogers and Hope Claiborne were playing when they heard police in a helicopter asking for help looking for the missing woman. They grabbed Hope's younger brother, Kashton Claiborne, and Logan, hopped on their bikes and started searching the park and neighborhood near Cooley Middle School.\n\nThe numbers don't add up: Thousands of California seniors are 'one disaster away' from homelessness. What can the state do?\n\nDuring the search, Logan fell off his bike and the kids headed home so he could get patched up while they ate dinner. That's when his mother, Alyssa Hultman, first learned about their mission.\n\n\"Even after Logan took a fall down a hill, the kids went back and out and were very determined,\" she said. \"They told us that they are going to be the ones that find her.\"\n\nWhen the kids set off again, they searched near their neighborhood, which Logan said is close to the senior center that Belford disappeared from. The group spotted a woman walking around and consulted a photo to be sure that it was Belford before 11-year-old Hope called the police.\n\n\"That\u2019s when the police came and, well, they took care of everything else,\" Logan said. \"We were very excited, very happy.\"\n\nAlyssa Hultman said she was \"really proud\" of all the kids for taking it upon themselves to help.\n\n\"It shows a lot of their character and the type of people that they are,\" she said. \"They just made the choice as a group to go and help someone and I think that\u2019s really cool.\"\n\nPolice said they were \"overwhelmed\" by the number of residents who helped look for Belford \u2014 including the \"junior detectives\" who eventually located her.\n\n\"This is a great example of our exceptional community coming together to lend a helping hand,\" police said in a statement on Facebook. \"This proves a great point, age is just a number and anyone can help out in a time of need.\"\n\nFollow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/06/california-junior-detectives-find-missing-97-year-old-woman/3891994002/", "description": "Police in California are thanking a group of \"junior detectives\" who recently helped locate a missing 97-year-old woman with dementia.", "authors": ["N'Dea Yancey-Bragg", "Published P.M.
