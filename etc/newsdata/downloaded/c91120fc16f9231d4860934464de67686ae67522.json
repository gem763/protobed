Before I had braces, my teeth stuck out and I was picked on by the boys.\n\n'The girls made fun of my thick, wavy hair, as Jennifer Aniston's poker straight locks were in fashion.'\n\nThe stylist (aged 13) said that she was bullied at school over her 'individual style' and for dressing differently to other students\n\nThe mother-of-one was able to pay the \u00a31,500 she needed to study for a diploma in personal styling at the Style Coaching Institute in 2011\n\nShe added: 'I failed maths and science at school and got Cs in everything else.\n\n'When I got to college, I reinvented myself, my style, became more confident, got a great group of friends and was regularly told off by the teachers for socialising more than working!\n\n'I didn't go to uni as I hated studying and didn't pass my exams with good enough grades.'\n\nAt 18, Susie, who has built up a 23,000-strong following on Instagram thanks to word of mouth, 'fell' into an admin career that she 'hated'.\n\nFor 12 years, she worked for various companies, where she was even mocked by her colleagues for showing off her fashion style.\n\nShe said: 'It felt like I was being stifled and I felt terrified it would be my life forever. I had so much creativity and had no idea where to channel it!\n\n'My last job in admin was for a male-dominated engineering company. I expressed my style when I worked in the office and got ribbed regularly by the many older men I worked with.'\n\nFor Susie, it was the final straw to find a job that she loved, but she admits because she's not 'academically gifted' she felt she wouldn't go far as a business woman.\n\nBut in 2011, she pulled together the \u00a31,500 she needed to study for a diploma in personal styling at the Style Coaching Institute in 2011.\n\nSusie, who was also mocked by her colleagues for showing off her fashion style, decided to specialise in high street styling without any financial help\n\nShe wanted to 'help women feel good about their bodies and to bring personal style to women like me'.\n\nBut her next challenge was soon to come when at 29, Susie gave birth to her son Clark. At six weeks old he caught whooping cough and almost died.\n\nSusie admits she found motherhood tough - and developed post-natal depression after Clark's brush with death.\n\n'It was so hard and I felt out of my depth,' she said.\n\nEmotionally drained, Susie knew she didn't want to go back to work in an office - so she made the leap to launch Styled By Susie, specialising in high street styling, without any financial help.\n\nSusie said that before she got braces her teeth would stick out and she was picked on by the her fellow peers\n\nThe award-winning stylist now offers face-to-face styling sessions at Bluewater shopping centre which are booked up until December\n\nSusie explained: 'I'm not from a middle-class, privileged background and have no amazing connections; and I had to work very hard.\n\n'I used to work for free to help build up my client base. I would work Friday evenings doing group styling, until 1am, and would be in Bluewater on a Saturday morning at 9am the next day.\n\n'My little boy was only 18 months and it was hard!'. But Susie's efforts paid off.\n\nHer clients - known as her 'tribe' - took to Facebook to praise her personal stylist sessions, and word soon spread.\n\nSusie initially worked for free to help build up her client base and would work Friday evenings doing group styling, until 1am\n\nThe group now boasts 11,000 women from around the world who Susie has styled - or who are waiting for sessions to become available.\n\nNow, she only works four days a week during term time, and enjoys spending time with Clark and Tom during the school holidays - and she's won a Best Stylist Award.\n\nSusie specialises in women on a budget whose bodies have changed shape - whether that's due to motherhood, the menopause, or losing or gaining weight.\n\nShe offers face-to-face styling sessions at Bluewater shopping centre (\u00a3150 for three hours), that are booked up until December 2020, as well as online consultations ranging from \u00a335 to \u00a385 to women from around the world.\n\nSusie said: 'I empower women to dress for their shapes as they are, and to shine to their full potential.\n\n'I help clients of all shapes and sizes, and I work with realistic budgets and my clients like me because they can relate to me. I am not filtered, glossy or pretentious!'\n\nShe said: 'In a world of Instagram fashion influencers and celebrity stylists, I like to fly the flag for real women, and offering realistic style tips on achievable and affordable budgets.'\n\nAlongside her face-to-face styling sessions, Susie also at offers online consultations ranging from \u00a335 to \u00a385 to women from around the world", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Susie Hasler, 36, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, who was bullied at school for standing out, is now an award-winning fashion stylist who is  booked up until December 2020.", "authors": ["Carol Driver For The Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/08/19431090-0-image-a-6_1570519666776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
