These are not particularly attractive metrics for a services business, in our view.\"\n\nHargreaves has a sector-weight rating on Apple shares and thinks the company's fiscal 2020 earnings per share will total $12.50, below consensus expectations of $12.68 per FactSet data.\n\n\"Apple's hardware sales are essential to virtually all Apple services, which suggests the two are part of a cohesive whole,\" he added. \"Apple's breakdown of Hardware and Services revenue and gross profit is increasingly irrelevant, in our view, as changes to segment reporting have prompted Apple to book several aspects of what most would think of as a hardware sale in the Services segment.\"\n\nDespite KeyBanc's lackluster outlook for the company's services business, Apple shares are easily outpacing the broader stock market in 2019. The stock is up over 40% through Wednesday's close compared to the S&P 500's 19% gain.\n\nNotwithstanding the outperformance this year, however, Hargreaves argued that even booking hardware sales in the Services segment may not be a long-term fix given recent iPhone sales patterns.\n\n\"We estimate the base of iPhone owners with new iPhones is now 420M, and has been stagnant over the last 12 months,\" he continued. \"The high-end smartphone market appears highly saturated and we see limited opportunity for significant share gains. This suggests iPhone user growth will continue decelerating going forward.\"\n\n\"Consequently, we view the shares as fully valued at current levels and would prefer to own FB and GOOGL,\" he wrote.\n\nHargreaves is one of Wall Street's leading technology analysts and is ranked No. 106 of 5,550 total analysts on Wall Street tracked by TipRanks. Investors who followed his buy and sell ratings since January 2009 have seen an average return of 23.5%, according to TipRanks.", "description": "A top tech analyst says Apple isn't a compelling service-based investment when compared to peers like Facebook or Alphabet.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101504801-1555512551694cook.jpg?v=1555512574", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
