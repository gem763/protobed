What's next? Recorded Oct. 14, 2019 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. Dave Birkett and Jeff Seidel, Detroit Free Press\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 Detroit Lions coach Matt Patricia was about to enter the interview room when he stopped and changed direction.\n\nHe hobbled on his boot, walking slowly toward Lions owner Martha Firestone Ford. He bent down and she gave him a hug.\n\n\u201cThe guys are hurting,\u201d Patricia said in her ear, in a cramped hallway, after the Lions lost to the Green Bay Packers, 23-22, on Monday night at Lambeau Field.\n\nYes, this hurts.\n\nYou can point to several reasons why the Lions lost. At the most basic level, the Lions kicked too many field goals (five) and didn\u2019t get enough touchdowns (one).\n\nBut the refs played a critical role, too, blowing several calls that led to a touchdown and the winning field goal.\n\n\u201cWe are not playing the officials,\u201d Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \u201cWe are playing the Packers.\u201d\n\nWell, a lot of Lions fans would disagree with that.\n\nDetroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford scrambles away from a Green Bay Packers defender at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis., Oct. 14, 2019.

The Lions got into the red zone three times but scored one touchdown. You can\u2019t beat Aaron Rodgers \u2013 and the refs, too \u2013 when you kick five field goals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the story of the game in my opinion,\u201d Stafford said, of the red zone problems. \u201cThe defense played well enough for us to win the game. We made some big plays on offense. We just didn\u2019t put the ball in the end zone. Can\u2019t do that on the road against a good team.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not wrong.\n\nAnd it was a problem all night.\n\nThe Lions started the game with a flea flicker, a brilliant call. Stafford handed off to Kerryon Johnson, and the Packers' safeties crashed. That opened up the field and Stafford hit Kenny Golladay for an easy 66 yards.\n\n\u201cWe practiced that all week and felt good about it,\u201d Golladay said. \u201cLet\u2019s go make a play. Let\u2019s start the game off with a bang.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: The Lions settled for a field goal, which was the story of the game.\n\n\u201cIt was just another situation where we wish we had come out with seven points instead of three,\u201d Golladay said.\n\nYes, that's too much wishing and not enough doing.\n\nThe Lions started their second possession with another big play when Stafford threw a 58-yard pass to Marvin Hall. Johnson scored a 1-yard TD and the Lions had a 10-0 lead.\n\nBut the touchdowns disappeared after that.\n\nStafford said it wasn't a change in philosophy. They just missed on the big plays.\n\n\u201cIn the red area, execution has to be at its highest, whether it\u2019s communication or alignments,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cWe have to clean that up.\u201d\n\nThe Lions will look back at this game and point to several plays that would have made a difference.\n\nT.J. Hockenson couldn\u2019t hang onto a touchdown pass.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we have to get touchdowns,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve got to get those points.\"\n\nThe Lions were 3-for-13 on third down.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fundamental stuff,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cWe just have to just throw and catch better. That\u2019s what third down is about most of the time. We just gotta execute better.\u201d\n\nIn the third quarter, the Lions wasted another opportunity, after Dee Virgin caused a fumble on a punt.\n\nThe Lions advanced inside the Packers 25 and had to settle for a field goal. Technically, it wasn\u2019t inside the red zone. But it was another blown opportunity, wasting a short field.\n\n\u201cWe need to get better,\u201d wideout Danny Amendola said. \u201cYou kick yourselves offensively with missed opportunities and getting five field goals. \u2026 We just have to finish it off. We did some good things tonight and made some good plays, yet there are opportunities we missed and we can\u2019t miss those opportunities and expect to win.\u201d\n\nNo. Not when you have to beat Aaron Rodgers.\n\nAnd the refs.\n\nContact Jeff Seidel: jseidel@freepress.com.
