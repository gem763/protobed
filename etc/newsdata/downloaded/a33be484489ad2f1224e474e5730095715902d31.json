With so many designers, major cities and now a state taking a stand against the sale of fur, we're that much closer to ending this unnecessary and inhumane practice.'\n\nIn a statement from Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette, he said the company has been monitoring consumer trends for two years and exploring viable alternatives to fur.\n\nPreviously, Macy's sold fur products costing as much as $14,000 and had a store division called the 'Fur Vault'\n\nGennette said: 'Over the past two years, we have been closely following consumer and brand trends, listening to our customers and researching alternatives to fur.'\n\n'We've listened to our colleagues, including direct feedback from our Go Green Employee Resource Group, and we have met regularly on this topic with the Humane Society of the United States and other NGO.'\n\nGennette has also urged other retailers to listen to costumers calling for more animal friendly clothing.\n\nMacy's new policy will still allow some fur products like ethically sourced sheep fur, according to their website.\n\n'Our fur-free policy was developed in partnership with the Humane Society of the United States and in alignment with Fur Free Alliance guidelines, which allow ethically sourced sheep fur products referred to as 'shearling' or 'sheepskin,' and cattle fur referred to 'calf hair' and 'cowhide,' their website said.\n\nMacy's, which has more than 600 department stores and earned $25 billion in annual sales in 2018, is following in the footsteps of fellow fashion brands who have denounced fur from their collections.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States took to Twitter to celebrate Macy's new policy\n\nIn 2018, fashion powerhouse Gucci dropped fur products because of modern technology.\n\n'We've been talking about\u2026 for a few months,' Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri said.\n\n'Technology is now available that means you don't need to use fur. The alternatives are luxurious. There is just no need.'\n\nMichael Kors have also stopped making items with fur.\n\nPictured: one of the fur coats currently sold at Macy's that will be banned by 2021\n\nBefore the announcement, Macy's was selling fur products costing as much as $8,000 for a mink-fur jacket and $14,000 for a chinchilla jacket.\n\nGennette said: 'Macy's private brands are already fur free so expanding this practice across all Macy's, Inc. is the natural next step.'\n\nMacy's is the first American department store to make such a large step and P.J. Smith, the director of fashion policy at the Humane Society, hopes this will inspire others.\n\nHe told the New York Times: 'Now that so many brands that are sold at Macy's and Bloomingdale's are going fur-free, it's becoming easier for these stores.'\n\n'It's a really good opportunity for them to reach that younger generation of consumers that are going to have the buying power in the very near future.'\n\nThe oncoming wave of eco-friendly shoppers have already hit the state of California.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom signed a bill this month banning fur sales.\n\n'I just signed #AB44 -- one of the strongest animal rights laws in US History - making California the first state in the nation to ban new fur sales,' Newsom said.\n\n'Also signed a package of important bills that will bring an end to the cruel treatment of many animals across our state.'\n\nThe bill specifies the sale and manufacturing of fur.\n\nIn a statement from PETA, they applauded the California's new policy.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom announced on Twitter that he banned the sale on fur in the state of California\n\n'Today's decision was a powerful one. When Los Angeles speaks, the world listens, and it's now the largest and most notable city to tell the world that 'fur is dead' \u2014 but it's not the only major city to take a stand.\n\n'In March \u2014 following appeals from PETA and activists who attended numerous committee meetings and held a rally at city hall \u2014 the San Francisco Board of Supervisors also voted to ban fur sales.'\n\nThe new policy will go into effect January 2023 and will directly affect clothing, handbags and shoes.\n\nHowever, the law does not include used fur, taxidermy, leather, cowhide and shearling.\n\nFur used for religious purposes or by Native American tribes are also exempt from the policy.", "description": "American department store Macy's has banned the sale of all fur products from their namesake store and Bloomingdales after two years of research on consumer trends and alternatives to fur", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/15/20038956-0-image-a-2_1571753876833.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
