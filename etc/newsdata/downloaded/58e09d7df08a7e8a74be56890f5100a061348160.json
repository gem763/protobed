Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, says it's not clear when the inflection point for giving up the steering wheel will be, if ever.\n\nDriving the news: UAW members and General Motors approved a four-year labor contract on Friday, which secured better pay and benefits for workers. The union will now turn its attention to Ford, with the GM contract as a template.\n\nThe end of the nearly 6-week-old strike comes with a promise from UAW to not oppose GMs' plans to close four facilities across the U.S. The strike has cost GM $1.75 billion in lost profits, according to Anderson Economic Group.\n\ncomes with a promise from UAW to not oppose GMs' plans to close four facilities across the U.S. The strike has cost GM $1.75 billion in lost profits, according to Anderson Economic Group. GM committed to adding thousands of new jobs and said it would decrease the number of years required for workers to earn the top wage of more than $32 an hour. Union members were divided prior to the deal on whether it provided enough long-term job security.\n\nGM is more aggressive than most in the push toward the future with its majority stake in self-driving startup Cruise Automation and a plan to introduce 20 EVs by 2023.\n\nThe automaker is sustained, however, by the fat profits from traditional pickup trucks and SUVs.\n\nTo pay for the R&D on future technologies, GM needs to keep pushing those gas guzzlers for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"They're really trying to run 2 auto companies,\" says Barclays automotive analyst Brian Johnson.\n\nGM tried to protect its flexibility in the labor agreement by trading higher wages and benefits for the ability to close a massive car factory in Ohio and two transmission plants.\n\nYes, but: Detroit's total labor costs remain significantly higher than foreign-based rivals with factories here: $63 per hour at GM vs. $61 for Ford, $55 for Fiat Chrysler and $50 for the so-called transplants.\n\nBut all 3 Detroit carmakers left their flank open by getting out of the traditional sedan business \u2014 effectively ceding that market to Asian competitors.\n\nA new president could alter the landscape, too. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has pledged to halt fracking, which would likely drive up oil prices.\n\nThat would make those thirsty trucks and SUVs less appealing to consumers, squeezing Detroit's primary profit source.\n\nTrade policy and emissions standards are also wild cards, depending on who is in the White House.\n\nWhat to watch: Auto sales are already trending downward. A recession would cause them to drop 20%, Smoke tells Axios.\n\nGo deeper: 40-day GM strike ends with new labor contract", "description": "The United Auto Workers approved a four-year labor contract with GM on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/uz8JRm7gD2pUCauS1HXTOTdgeb8=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/25/1572037232227.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
