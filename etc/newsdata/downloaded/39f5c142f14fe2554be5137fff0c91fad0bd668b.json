However, he said that was partly due to the fact that most vehicles were destroyed by the storm.\n\nFood and supplies were still flooding into Marsh Harbour Airport in the Abaco Islands, but for the most part, no locals were there to use them.\n\nFox News was told that rescues in the Abaco Islands are largely completed, as are most evacuations. Military aircraft are now flying supplies to the smaller surrounding cays, where more residents have chosen not to evacuate.\n\nIn Marsh Harbour, neighborhoods with names like \u201cPigeon Pea\u201d and \u201cda Mudd\u201d are empty. All that appears to be left are piles of rubble and the bodies buried underneath them. On a nearby dock, pallets of emergency ready meals sat untouched for most the afternoon.\n\nIn one grocery store, shelves are filled with food. Boxes of donated food are scattered about, but they are unopened and only a handful of people were coming for supplies. Some say supplies are not getting to the people who need them fast enough -- and many of those in need have already evacuated to Nassau.\n\nAtisha Kemp, a local activist and one of many still searching for missing relatives, says those who survived Dorian\u2019s wrath are \u201ccoming out of hell and going right back into hell.\n\n\u201cWe got thousands of people coming [to Nassau]. Don't know where they're going. They're going in shelters,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWe have no plan. Who's going to assist us? Who is coming to help us?\u201d\n\nUS WORRIED CHINA'S RELIEF EFFORT IN BAHAMAS MAY BE BID TO GAIN INFLUENCE, REPORTS SAY\n\nMortuary facilities in Nassau are overwhelmed, according to officials. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency says the dead are being placed in body bags and temporarily stored in refrigerated containers. Fox News saw at least two bodies recovered in Abaco, on Tuesday.\n\nIn Nassau, shelters are overcrowded. Sixteen children, most of them toddlers, were brought to the Children Emergency Hostel on Sunday. Caretaker Lovinia Baker Hutchison told Fox News the shelter has never had as many children as it has right now.\n\nNow that the children are in Nassau, Hutchinson said, \"there's not much to do, but care for one another and pray that everything will get better.\"\n\nThe storm is believed to have left 70,000 Bahamians homeless. Many, like Shakeria Blanc, say they have nowhere to go.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBlanc arrived in Nassau from the Abaco Islands over the weekend with her 5-year-old son and 5-month-old daughter. She told Fox News that her family lost everything when Hurricane Dorian came through.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know [where we\u2019ll go]. As soon as we register we\u2019ll figure out what we\u2019re going to do, where we\u2019re going to stay and everything. Right now, we are all homeless,\u201d she said with a shrug, \u201cjust hoping for the best.\"\n\nFox News' Kathleen Reuschle and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The Bahamian government has denied allegations that officials\u00a0are rejecting or stalling aid\u00a0for the Abaco Islands\u00a0in a bid\u00a0to pressure remaining\u00a0residents to evacuate.", "authors": ["Ellison Barber"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Bahamas-Abaco-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
