But if you watch the debate, it is the only moment in the debate where the audience flew out of their chairs in an eruptive standing ovation. Because that\u2019s what the people want,\u201d said Mr. Moore.\n\n\u201cWe need to have some courage,\u201d Mr. Moore added. \u201cNo one had ever said it. No Republican had ever said it. But no Democrat had ever said it. Because you\u2019re not supposed to say it.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke, a former three-term U.S. congressman for Texas, caught flack from more moderate Democrats after saying during a presidential debate last month that his administration would ban and confiscate firearms used in several recent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said during the party\u2019s third primary debate. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against a fellow American anymore.\u201d\n\nDemocrats went \u201cballistic\u201d following Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s debate performance, Mr. Moore said during the interview.\n\nMr. Moore, 65, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2002 for \u201cBowling for Columbine,\u201d a film about American gun culture he wrote, produced and directed. It was named for and focuses on the mass-shooting at Columbine High School near Denver, Colorado, where two students fatally gunned down 13 of their classmates three years earlier.\n\nDespite the kind words for the El Paso Democrat, Mr. O\u2019Rourke can rule out his support for Democratic nominee, however. Mr. Moore last weekend publicly endorsed the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
