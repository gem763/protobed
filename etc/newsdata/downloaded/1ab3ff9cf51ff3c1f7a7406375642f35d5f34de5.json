He\u2019s gone.\n\nHAYDN\n\nThis guy looks like a real estate agent who will tell you the house\u2019s foundations are SUPER great and then you move in and the house sinks into an abyss. Bye.\n\nSCOT\n\nThis guy has only made it this far on account of the fact I remember him being the pig from the photo shoot.\n\nJESSE\n\nJesse looks like maybe bad news, like the guy you meet at ~the clerb~ and you have a cheeky dance floor pash, but then he reveals he\u2019s like, a Trump supporter or that he likes going pig hunting on the weekends.\n\nADAM\n\nHe\u2019s only making it this far because he has long hair and therefore somewhat more of a stage presence.\n\nCIARRAN\n\nBooting midway through the season for suuuuuure, Ciarran is peak Darwin, by which I mean \u2013 expat, probably works at that Crocosaurus Cove thing, still lives in a backpackers hostel even though he\u2019s been on a visa for two years.\n\nALEX\n\nThe final long-haired adonis who isn\u2019t Timm goes around here.\n\nNIRANGA\n\nThis is around the time The Bachelorette abandons their token person of colour, usually. Like, how many seasons have we sat through where the top ten all look like convicts from 1788? Too many.\n\nCARLIN\n\nHEAR ME OUT HERE GUYS. I know Carlin\u2019s the favourite right now. But while he\u2019s the gentleman to end all gentlemen, does he have the chat to entertain Angie? I think not. I reckon he\u2019ll get around top 7 and after a particularly boring date, be dumped like a spicy potato.\n\nTOM\n\nThis is the bit where I start deciding Bachelorette people are frontrunners based simply on a \u201cvibe\u201d. Doesn\u2019t Tom give you the vibe of \u201cgood dude, loves his dog, close to his mum and won\u2019t gaslight you while fucking your best friend behind your back\u201d? He\u2019s not gonna win but I reckon he\u2019ll go far.\n\nJAMIE\n\nJamie is just too emotional, bless his heart, so the producers will keep him around much to Angie\u2019s dislike until riiiight before shit gets super serious, so his feelings fully develop to the point where he goes to sleep imagining his wedding to Angie, and then BAM! You can pinpoint the second his heart rips in two.\n\nGLENN\n\nWho is this? He looks like a cricketer and for some reason, I can imagine Angie with a cricketer. I have no other reason for him getting this high up in the list. Just those cricketer vibes.\n\nJACKSON\n\nThat one penguin photo shoot scores Jackson Top 3, which is ridiculous but what did you expect from me, guys. I mean, what did you think was going to happen here \u2013 I\u2019d be psychic? I\u2019d actually know some things? Haha!\n\nMATT\n\nAlready Matt has been named by Angie\u2019s bro as the dude he likes the most for her, and Angie seems to vibe him too. Top 2, I\u2019m calling it.\n\nTIMM\n\nGUYS HE BROUGHT THE SPIRITUAL SUNFLOWERS. He\u2019s hilarious. He\u2019s hot. I can imagine Angie and Timm setting up in some beachside shack down from the Goldie and having 3 kids called like, Tommo, Sunflower and\u2026. Bruce. He\u2019s The Dude.
