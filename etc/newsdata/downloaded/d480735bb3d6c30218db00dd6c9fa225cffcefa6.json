Once they welcomed weary caravans traversing the Silk Roads: now they stand as testimony to the ingenuity of a lost civilisation.\n\nThis is the ancient walled city of Shibam, nicknamed the \u201cManhattan of the desert\u201d by the British explorer Freya Stark in the 1930s, in modern-day Yemen, a country also home to an untold number of other archeological treasures. The kingdom of Saba, ruled by the legendary Queen of Sheba, and many other dynasties of the ancient world rose and fell here, their fortunes linked to Yemen\u2019s position at the crossroads of early frankincense and spice trades between Africa and Asia.\n\nToday, as a result of Yemen\u2019s complex civil war \u2013 now in its fifth year \u2013 many of the country\u2019s wonders have been damaged or are under threat. While the destruction pales in comparison to the human cost of the conflict, the country\u2019s rich cultural heritage has also been ravaged.\n\nQuick guide The Yemen conflict explained Show Hide How long has the war been going on? Yemen has been troubled by civil wars for decades, but the current conflict intensified in March 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened on behalf of the internationally recognised government against Houthi rebels aligned with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The war is widely regarded as having turned a poor country into a humanitarian catastrophe. Riyadh expected its air power, backed by regional coalition including the United Arab Emirates, could defeat the Houthi insurgency in a matter of months but instead it has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population - more than 24 million people - requiring assistance or protection and more than 90,000 dead.\n\nWhat is the cause of the war? Its roots lie in the Arab spring. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets in a bid to force the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to end his 33-year rule. He responded with economic concessions but refused to resign. By March 2011, tensions on the streets of the capital city, Sana\u2019a, resulted in protesters dying at the hands of the military. Following an internationally brokered deal, there was a transfer of power in November to the vice-president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, paving the way for elections in February 2012 \u2013 in which he was the only candidate to lead a transitional government. Hadi\u2019s attempts at constitutional and budget reforms were rejected by Houthi rebels from the north. The Houthis captured the capital, forcing Hadi to flee eventually to Riyadh.

The true figures are believed to be much higher: deliberate targeting by Saudi airstrikes, Houthi rebels, Islamic State and al-Qaida, and a booming smuggling trade have all contributed to the loss of thousands of relics.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The entrance of one of Shibam\u2019s mudbrick high-rise buildings.

In the 16th century, Shibam\u2019s inhabitants found they had run out of space to expand. To compensate, they began to build carefully on a rectangular street grid, and instead of spreading out, they built up, giving the world its first skyscrapers. The tallest of Shibam\u2019s mudbrick and cedarwood towers contains eight storeys and stands 30 metres high.\n\nHigh above the desert valley floor, Shibam is close to water sources but relatively safe from flooding. The shadows cast by the tall buildings provide lots of shade to the hot streets below and the fortified outer wall and high vantage point from the towers made it hard for rival tribes to attack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man walks past a damaged high-rise building in Shibam. In order to maintain the buildings from rain and erosion the walls need to be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud. Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian\n\nThe city\u2019s 3,000 residents still largely follow the traditional living pattern, with in some cases up to 40 family members in the same tower. Animals and tools are kept on the ground floor and food is stored on the second. Elderly people live on the third and the fourth is used for entertaining. Higher levels are occupied by more nimble families, with childless newlyweds on the roof.\n\nI worry that this will be the last generation able to make a life here and appreciate Shibam\u2019s beauty Salim Rubiyah\n\nInternal doors link up to 10 houses on a street block, although bridges from roof to roof that saved elderly legs from climbing up and down staircases have not survived.\n\nToday the streets are too narrow for cars, but Shibam is largely self-sustaining: its farmers and shopkeepers cater to the small population and many men are employed baking the straw and mud bricks used in construction. As in many Yemeni cities, goats and chickens roam the streets.\n\n\u201cLots of young people have left,\u201d said Ali Abdullah, 28, who was looking after his family\u2019s goats along with his 10-year-old brother, Majid. \u201cShibam is beautiful but there is no reliable money to make here unless they start preserving the buildings again.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salim Rubiyah, 61, head of the local association responsible for looking after the public buildings inside Shibam\u2019s walls. Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian\n\nWhile their owners do what they can to rebuild crumbling walls and protect their homes from termites with limewash, Shibam\u2019s 444 buildings are vulnerable to wind, rain and heat erosion: the outer layers of clay need constant maintenance to stop the walls cracking and eventually collapsing.\n\nSince Yemen\u2019s Arab Spring revolt in 2011, funding to help preserve the city has dried up, as has the once steady flow of tourists, said Salim Rubiyah, the head of the local association responsible for looking after the public buildings inside Shibam\u2019s walls.\n\nWe are nervous about the politicisation of heritage and the militarisation of archaeology during the conflict Sama\u2019a al-Hamdani\n\nTwo towers have collapsed in the last few years, and at least 15 more are in urgent need of repair, according to the General Organisation for the Preservation of Historic Cities in Yemen.\n\n\u201cShibam is very special,\u201d said Rubiyah. \u201cI don\u2019t know why everyone doesn\u2019t build like this. I worry that this will be the last generation who are able to make a life here and appreciate the city\u2019s beauty.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Yemen, the story repeats itself. A ruin reputed to be the location of the Queen of Sheba\u2019s throne, potentially the only vestige from her 10th-century BCE kingdom, lies in the desert near the Yemeni town of Marib. As the purported political, religious and economic centre of her legendary civilisation, the site is considered of huge significance. Prof Abdullah Abu al-Ghaith of Sana\u2019a University has described it as the eighth wonder of the world.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A family sits in the ruins of the Barran Temple \u2013 reputed to be the location of the Queen of Sheba\u2019s throne \u2013 near Marib in September 2019. Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian\n\nExcavation teams and foreign visitors have stayed away since an 2007 al-Qaida attack on a temple in the area killed at least 10 people, including eight Spanish tourists. Today, the sites are covered in litter and graffiti, ancient carvings are exposed to sandstorms and the perimeter is only protected by flimsy fences.\n\nIn Sana\u2019a, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, ancient sites have been razed by Saudi-led coalition bombing. Several blocks of Sana\u2019a\u2019s old city are now just rubble and dishevelled palm trees, where tall red mud-brick buildings decorated with ornate white gypsum window frames used to stand.\n\n'Now it's just ghosts': Yemenis living under the shadow of death by airstrike Read more\n\nDespite Unesco having provided the coalition with a no-strike list of historical sites when the campaign began in 2015, sites such as the Castle of Taiz have been targeted, as well as the Dhamar Museum.\n\n\u201cWe are nervous about the politicisation of heritage and the militarisation of archaeology during the conflict,\u201d said Sama\u2019a al-Hamdani, director of the Yemen Cultural Institute for Heritage and the Arts.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that the narratives told on the destruction of heritage are factual and accurate [and] we need to keep Yemeni heritage protected from the parties participating in the destruction \u2013 you can\u2019t be the destroyer and the saviour at the same time.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "In addition to the conflict\u2019s huge human cost, Yemen\u2019s rich cultural heritage has been ravaged, from the Queen of Sheba\u2019s reputed throne room to the mudbrick high-rises of Shibam", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5212a614a7e872e914f6e83efc5366cc216a897/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df286bc4eef4253416420b89f975f85b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
