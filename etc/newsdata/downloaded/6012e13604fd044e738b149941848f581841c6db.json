They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far and that\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up because she\u2019s also a Russian asset.\u201d\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill confirmed that the former secretary of state was referring to Gabbard. Gabbard, who has previously said she would not run as a third-party candidate, fired back on Twitter.\n\n\"Thank you @HillaryClinton,\" Gabbard tweeted. \"You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me,\" Gabbard continued. \"Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\"\n\nGabbard is frequently mentioned in Russian propaganda and media, including by RT, the news agency backed by the Kremlin, and she has been criticized for foreign policy views that some say are aligned too closely with Russia and other foreign adversaries of the United States \u2014 especially her views on Syria and Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nGabbard has struggled to gain traction and polling and fundraising in the Democratic presidential primary. Most polls have shown her in single digits, and she raised $3 million in the most recent fundraising quarter, far behind the frontrunners for the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut Gabbard has participated in three Democratic debates and maintained a presence as a favorite among some liberal activists.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/02/85/87ac8ebc4fa794e7f2d87cd7874a/191018-hillary-clinton-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
