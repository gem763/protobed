The Administration\u2019s tax cuts and deregulation have helped increase our energy exports to a whopping 3 million barrels per day and propelled us to surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world\u2019s largest crude oil producer.\n\nBecoming the world\u2019s biggest crude oil producer is a miracle to our economy and national security and is something that would have been unthinkable, even 3 years ago during the Obama Administration.\n\nDespite these good policies that have led to remarkable results, challenges to our country\u2019s energy security remain. Liberals continue to push burdensome regulations that stifle industry and, even further beyond our control, geopolitics and international instability continuously threaten American consumers by triggering high gas prices. The recent oil field attacks in Saudi Arabia are just one example of the kinds of world events that jeopardize the economic results this administration has worked so hard to achieve.\n\nAnother example of this kind of instability is the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. This country, home to the world\u2019s largest known oil reserves, has for over a century been one of America\u2019s top energy partners. Before socialism depleted its wealth, Venezuela\u2019s economy was six times that of China and, in 1950, the country had the fourth largest GDP in the world. But thanks to socialist policies and a thuggish regime headed by dictator Nicolas Maduro, their currency has become virtually worthless and the Venezuelan people face unbearable living conditions. Their human rights are being violated every day in a state governed by lawlessness, while countries like China and Russia continue to attempt to prop up the regime and its socialism, in order to access the country\u2019s vast energy resources.\n\nTo ensure Venezuelans are at the helm of their own economic recovery and that Americans\u2019 energy security remains shielded from the opportunism of our adversaries, the United States must continue the longtime energy alliance between our two countries. As it stands, this alliance is the only glimmer of hope for Venezuela\u2019s economic rebuilding in a post-Maduro, post-socialist future-- by halting this partnership and forcing American energy companies out of Venezuela now, we undermine the ability of the Venezuelan people to eventually rebuild their economic future.\n\nIf that were to happen, Chinese and Russian interests would also act quickly to fill the gap. Along with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, our opponents would gain access to the billions of dollars\u2019 worth of infrastructure investments our energy sector has made in Venezuela over the past 100 years. By forcing American companies out of Venezuela, we would simultaneously reduce American energy security and increase that of our adversaries who, instead of assisting in Venezuela\u2019s rebuilding, will exploit the country\u2019s resources for their own benefit. We must keep our decades long energy alliance with Venezuela and its wonderful people alive after Maduro\u2019s reign inevitably comes to an end.\n\nCurrently, the Trump Administration has allowed these American companies to maintain a presence in Venezuela, but this waiver is set to expire in October. Some naively think that pulling our companies out will hasten Maduro\u2019s demise, but this view discounts the greater international narrative at play in favor of a potential, but far from guaranteed, short-term foreign policy victory. More likely than Maduro\u2019s socialist regime falling, forcing American companies out of the country would likely guarantee his socialist reign continues on, propped up by China and Russia, who of course would be more than willing to keep him there in exchange for access to Venezuelan oil.\n\nIn short, forcing American companies out of Venezuela is the wrong path forward for both Venezuela and the United States.\n\nPresident Trump should be commended for taking a strong stand in opposition to Maduro\u2019s brutal dictatorship and in favor of America\u2019s energy future. He\u2019s been nothing short of a champion for freedom and capitalism during his first three years in office. And so long as we don\u2019t self-sabotage by handing China and Russia the ammunition they need to permanently prop Maduro up, his socialist regime will ultimately fall, as all socialist regimes eventually do.\n\nAndy Surabian is a Republican political and communications strategist.
