The complaint identified her boss, DLA Piper partner Louis Lehot, as the man who allegedly assaulted her in Shanghai, Brazil, Palo Alto, and Chicago.\n\n\u201cDuring my entire career I was known for my intellect, tenacity and confidence,\u201d Guerrero, who is married with children, wrote in an open letter to the firm earlier this month. \u201cIn less than nine months at DLA Piper... I became a shell of my former self.\u201d In her letter, Guerrero asked the firm to allow her to litigate the matter in court instead of through forced arbitration.\n\nA spokesman for the law firm has said the company took appropriate steps to investigate the allegations against Lehot as soon as they were reported and that the company \u201ctakes them seriously.\u201d\n\nLehot has since left the firm, the company said last week.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that the allegations have not been substantiated by the investigation to date, the firm has concluded for various reasons that it is in the best interest of the firm that we part ways with Louis Lehot,\u201d three executives wrote in a memo, Bloomberg Business reported.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the firm sent a letter to Guerrero claiming that \u201cduring the course of our investigation of your allegations against Louis Lehot, another individual at the firm alleged that you engaged in inappropriate behavior toward, and harassed, that individual.\u201d\n\n\u201cDLA Piper takes allegations of harassment seriously, regardless of the position or gender of the individual making those allegations or against whom they are made,\u201d said the letter, which was provided to The Daily Beast by Guerrero\u2019s attorney. \u201cUnfortunately, you continue to refuse to cooperate with that investigation, including refusing to discuss the allegations that have been made against you. Indeed, you refused to do so despite our stated willingness to allow your counsel to be present during the interview.\u201d\n\nThe memo states that Guerrero is barred from going to the Silicon Valley office or engaging in any of the firm\u2019s business until the investigation has concluded\u2014and that DLA Piper has retained an outside firm to probe the matter.\n\nGuerrero\u2019s attorney, Jeanne Christensen, said in a statement on Wednesday that the letter was sent overnight to media outlets \u201cacross the country\u201d in an attempt \u201cto publicly smear\u201d Guerrero \u201cfor daring to complain about being sexually assaulted.\u201d\n\nChristensen called the move \u201cbarbaric\u201d and unprecedented.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, as of the writing of this email, our firm and Ms. Guerrero have no knowledge or information about the purported \u2018harassment,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cThe message is loud and clear: #MeToo movement or not\u2014speaking out about gender motivated violence will result in untold harm, damage and pain to you personally and professionally.\u201d", "description": "The multinational law firm said that it has opened an investigation into harassment claims against Vanina Guerrero in the wake of her gender-discrimination complaint.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571253068/191016-messer-express-tease_ckavso", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
