The 74-year-old was a friend of Andy Warhol.\n\nIt stands on Friedrichsplatz, in the centre of the city of Kassel, where, on May 19, 1933, the Nazis burned some 2,000 books as part of their \u201cCampaign against the Un-German Spirit\u201d.\n\nOn display are works that were once deemed \u2018subversive\u2019 \u2013 too critical, too liberal, too erotic, etc. \u2013 and were banned under Adolf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich, Communist East Germany, or were removed from schools in the United States and beyond.\n\nOn display are works by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Bertolt Brecht, Sigmund Freud, and hugely popular modern classics such as J. D. Salinger\u2019s The Catcher in the Rye and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain.\n\nThe documenta 14 website describes the installation as \u201ca symbol of opposition to the banning of writings and the persecution of their authors.\u201d\n\nReplica of Parthenon by artist Minujin using 100,000 copies of banned books as a protest.

Where and why were Mickey Mouse strips banned? What\u2019s wrong with reading Twilight \u2013 the vampire-romance novel by author Stephenie Meyer \u2013 or Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s The Little Prince?\n\nThe 70-meter-long, 30-meter-wide and 20-meter-high metal construction is reminiscent of the Acropolis \u2013 a symbol of democracy that also serves as a visual bridge to Athens, where a sister documenta 14 show is being held for the first time since the prestigious art fair began in 1955.\n\nEach morning, students of the University of Kassel bring more of the controversial books \u2013 displayed behind protective plastic covers.\n\nSome works can already be found in several languages \u2013 but it\u2019s still a work in progress, and the artist hopes to collect thousands more.\n\nOnce the fair ends, the books will be donated. Some people argue the \u2018Parthenon of Books\u2019 should stay.\n\nAnother impressive exhibit is One Room Apartment, created with a series of ceramic pipes. It centres on the experience of Kurdish-Iraqi artist Hiwa K. after he fled northern Iraq on foot in the 1990\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe walked on foot across Turkey and then ended up for a time being in the town of Patras (Greece) where he lived in these ceramic pipes that are used for canalisation,\u201d Polish curator Adam Szymczyk told Reuters TV.\n\nHiwa K. describes the exhibit as a reflection on poverty, capitalism and what happens when people no longer have room for their belongings. He had hoped to turn the exhibit into an Airbnb space for visitors, but the city refused on health and safety grounds.\n\nDocumenta 14 in Kassel runs until September 17.", "description": "Get a full 360\u00ba view of this colossal installation by Argentine artist Marta Minuj\u00edn, a centrepiece of the _documenta 14_ art exhibition in Kassel, Germany.", "authors": ["Kirsten Ripper"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/377468/1000x563_377468.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-21"}
