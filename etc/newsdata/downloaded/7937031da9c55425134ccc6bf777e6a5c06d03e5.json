As we have mentioned, this will result in a smaller, global workforce ... While we cannot commit to an exact timeline, we expect this exercise to roll out largely by function and over the coming weeks. In certain jurisdictions, the timing may be different,\" the co-CEOs wrote in the email.\n\nThe email also said WeWork was still opening new buildings worldwide, which means it's still hiring support people for those locations, known as \"community managers\" or \"community staff.\"\n\n\"It is important to note that, as part of this reorganization, our Community teams will not be reduced. In fact, they will continue to grow as new buildings come online throughout the world,\" the CEOs wrote.\n\nWeWork's board has been working feverishly to secure new financing. The company may take a bailout from SoftBank, a deal which would value the company between $7.5 billion and $8 billion, CNBC reported on Monday.
