He\u2019s played the youngsters and I\u2019m pleased to see them in there, with Saka,\u2019 Wright said.\n\n\u2018But Saka, for an 18-year-old, if you\u2019re leaving [Mesut] Ozil totally out of the squad, then we have to see more from him [Saka], we have to see more from Joe [Willock].\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, it was a game where it passed them both by and then it comes down to the manager and his choices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s made the change at half-time, with Ceballos, so you\u2019re thinking to yourself: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you start him in the first place?\u201d\n\n\u2018Start him. He\u2019s someone that gets on the ball when they want to try and play out, [Matteo] Guendouzi\u2019s got a lot of energy and get the boys playing.\n\n\u2018[Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang didn\u2019t have anything to play off today because there wasn\u2019t any creativity.\u2019\n\nMORE: Roberto Firmino responds to Roy Keane\u2019s brutal attack on Liverpool and Man Utd stars", "description": "Ian Wright believes Bukayo Saka was rightly booked for diving inside the penalty area during Arsenal's 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United.
