This flouting of strict rules governing electronics use in the sensitive space alarmed national-security experts.\n\nThe chaotic image made for a bizarre contrast to how other Republicans had discussed issues surrounding impeachment yesterday alone. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked to confirm that he told Trump his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was \u201cinnocent,\u201d as the president claimed, McConnell bluntly denied that they\u2019d even spoken about the topic. Later, when reporters asked Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina whether the White House needed to do a \u201cbetter job\u201d of messaging on impeachment, he simply answered: \u201cYes.\u201d (The whiplash continued this morning, when Graham announced that he and McConnell would introduce a resolution condemning the probe.)\n\nThe messaging disarray began to manifest on September 25, when the White House released a summary of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky\u2014the centerpiece of the whistle-blower complaint. That day was an opportunity for the Trump administration to mold the controversy that was sure to ensue over the call\u2019s contents.\n\nIn the past, the administration had made the most of such opportunities: On March 24, for example, when Attorney General William Barr issued his four-page summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, he set the tone for how the years-long saga would be perceived. The report, Barr told the country, revealed \u201cno collusion\u201d and \u201cno obstruction\u201d\u2014phrasing that immediately infiltrated cable-news chyrons and Trump\u2019s Twitter feed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that, upon its release, the report proved far more damning than the attorney general\u2019s cursory summation had suggested. Barr\u2019s insistence on speaking for the report\u2014rather than letting the report speak for itself\u2014may have been one of the reasons Trump avoided impeachment in the spring. But in the case of his call with Zelensky, Trump failed to follow his attorney general\u2019s blueprint: When the White House released the summary of the call, there was no authority figure like Barr out front reframing the narrative. There were no early talking points for Republican lawmakers to parrot.\n\nWhite House attempts to reshape public impressions of the scandal have backfired. Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, made a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room last week and fielded questions about Ukraine, but he only helped confuse matters. One reason an aid package to Ukraine was held up, Mulvaney said, was because Trump wanted the country to open an investigation into the 2016 election that could help him politically. Mulvaney later tried to walk back what sounded precisely like a quid pro quo. Trump, who in recent weeks has considered firing Mulvaney, \u201cwasn\u2019t pleased,\u201d a person close to the president told us, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump\u2019s views about his staff\u2019s performance. \u201cThe Mulvaney thing hurt us. You don\u2019t have to be a genius to figure that out.\u201d", "description": "As the Ukraine scandal became a national conversation, the president known for his powerful sound bites was suddenly tongue-tied.", "authors": ["Elaina Plott", "Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2SIW2/facebook.jpg?1571927134", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
