Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes in September, though the number was down to 53 from 55 in August.\n\nThe government has clamped down on speculative investment in the housing market since 2016 to prevent a sharp correction as prices soared. But Beijing has been careful to tread its policy line to defuse risk without triggering a market collapse.\n\nAs local governments are given more autonomy in policymaking, price trends have been mixed, with some cities showing signs of rapid cooling while others are still plagued with overheating risks.\n\nNanning, a city in southern China near the border with Vietnam, was the top price performer in the month, with prices increasing 2.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nMIXED SIGNS\n\nWhile property investment stayed buoyant in September boosted by a rise in new construction activity, growth in property transactions slowed during what is traditionally China's \"Golden September\" peak season for new home sales. Sales were hurt by persistent pressures in the sector as a crackdown on speculators showed little signs of abating.\n\nEconomists noted some developers will likely ramp up sales promotion and slash prices towards the year-end to bolster their performance and secure revenues, though any sharp drop in home prices will not be tolerated by local governments.\n\n\"The current pace of construction is not sustainable given underlying housing demand. Developers are now slowing the launch of new projects in response to tighter access to financing and subdued sales,\" analysts at Capital Economics said in a recent note.", "description": "China's home price growth flatlines in Sept as fewer cities report gains", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9K05N_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
