After markets closed, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., which is partly owned by Toronto-Dominion Bank, took a similar step.\n\nSchwab chief financial officer Peter Crawford said the firm, which has around 12.1 million active brokerage accounts and US$3.72 trillion in client assets, had been seeing new companies trying to break into the market with low or no commissions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not feeling competitive pressure from these firms \u2026 yet,\u201d Crawford said in a commentary posted on Schwab\u2019s website. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to fall into the trap that a myriad of other firms in a variety of industries have fallen into and wait too long to respond to new entrants. It has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait?\u201d\n\nSome no-fee options already do exist in Canada, such as a National Bank of Canada direct brokerage, which offers commission-free Canadian and U.S. exchange-traded funds, as well as a Wealthsimple mobile app that provides zero-commission stock trading.\n\nBut just when the earthquake that rattled U.S. brokers makes its way to Canada \u2014 where big banks dominate the financial landscape, and where commissions of nearly $10 a trade are common at some big-bank-owned online brokerages \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\nCanadian financial institutions tend to move a little slower than their American counterparts, according to Mike Katchen, Wealthsimple\u2019s co-founder and CEO. It took banks here several years to roll out robo-advisors to compete with Wealthsimple\u2019s product, Katchen said, and he expects something similar with trading.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re here now and, I think, showing that the model works,\u201d Katchen said. \u201cI would expect that that\u2019s going to come to be a broader offering in the market in time.\u201d\n\nJ.D. Power conducts a satisfaction study of Canadian self-directed investors, and commissions have a \u201cpretty meaningful impact\u201d on findings, according to Michael Foy, senior director of wealth and lending intelligence at the research firm. Moreover, the draw of no commissions is that a firm could draw in customers and sell them other products and services.\n\n\u201cI do think that there\u2019s strong reasons for firms to try to attract new clients through eventually reducing trading fees to zero,\u201d Foy said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s increasingly going to be the expectation. I do think that Canada will get there, too.\u201d\n\nAsked if he sees the zero-commission trend coming to Canada, Glenn LaCoste, president and CEO of research company Surviscor, replied \u201cmy immediate answer is not immediately.\u201d\n\nI would expect that that's going to come to be a broader offering in the market in time. Mike Katchen, co-founder and CEO, Wealthsimple\n\n\u201cWe had enough trouble to getting to $10 over time,\u201d LaCoste said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have order flow like the U.S. has.\u201d\n\nThere are expectations that the latest round of fee reductions could put pressure on other U.S. brokerages to follow suit.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see other large private and public firms respond,\u201d a Morgan Stanley note said Wednesday.\n\nThe steps taken by Schwab and TD Ameritrade also followed those of another competitor, Interactive Brokers Group Inc.\n\nOn Sept. 26, Greenwich, Conn.-based Interactive announced a new service called IBKR Lite that offers zero commissions on U.S. exchange-listed stocks and ETFs. A spokesperson told the Financial Post on Wednesday that they are initially making IBKR Lite available to residents in the U.S. and India, but that there could be an opportunity for some Canadians.\n\n\u201cIntroducing Brokers \u2014 including iBrokers in Canada \u2014 may make it available to their clients if they wish to do so,\u201d wrote Kalen Holliday in an email.\n\nAn introducing broker can set pricing, which may mean clients end up paying in some way, Holliday wrote. But about a third of the firm\u2019s clients are introducing brokers, and they can opt to use IBKR Lite for clients.\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "'We had enough trouble to getting to $10 over time.
