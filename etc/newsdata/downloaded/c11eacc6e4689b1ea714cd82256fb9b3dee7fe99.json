That arrangement would largely solidify the position Turkey has gained after days of fighting.\n\nThe shelling Friday came even after the commander of Kurdish-led forces in Syria, Mazloum Abdi, told Kurdish TV late on Thursday: \u201cWe will do whatever we can for the success of the cease-fire agreement.\u201d But one Kurdish official, Razan Hiddo, declared that the Kurdish people would refuse to live under Turkish occupation.\n\nKurdish fighters have already been driven out of much, but not all, of a swath of territory that stretches about 100 kilometers (60 miles) along the middle of the Syrian-Turkish border, between Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad.\n\nBut Kurdish forces are still entrenched in Ras al-Ayn, where on Thursday they had been fiercely battling Turkish-backed Syrian fighters trying to take the town. Whether the Kurdish fighters pull out of Ras al-Ayn will likely be an early test of the accord.\n\nTurkish troops and their allied Syrian fighters launched the offensive two days after U.S. President Donald Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing American troops from the border area.\n\nThe Kurds were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State but came under assault after Trump ordered U.S. troops to pull out. The Kurdish-led forces have since invited the Syrian government\u2019s military, backed by Russia, to deploy there to protect them from Turkey. Syrian troops have already rolled into several key points along the border.\n\nTrump framed the U.S.-brokered cease-fire deal with Turkey as \u201ca great day for civilization\u201d but its effect was largely to mitigate a foreign policy crisis widely seen to be of his own making.\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish fighters terrorists because of their links to outlawed Kurdish rebels fighting inside Turkey since the 1980s.\n\nTurkey\u2019s pro-government dominated media hailed the cease-fire agreement as a clear win for Erdogan. \u201cGreat Victory\u201d read Yeni Safak\u2019s banner headline. \u201cTurkey got everything it wanted.\u201d Sabah newspaper headlined: \u201cWe won both on the field and on the (negotiating) table.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/76/074d73064b478555148949c95a37/191018-syria-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
