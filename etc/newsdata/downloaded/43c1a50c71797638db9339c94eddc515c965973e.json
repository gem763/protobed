The specialist grower BQ Support found that despite its greatest efforts, only 14 plants (one per cent) produced flowers. The vast majority \u2013 92 per cent \u2013 failed to produce any kind of plant at all.\n\nA similar investigation was done into sellers on the famous \u201cflower boulevard\u201d in the major flower town of Lisse, and found that only two per cent of bulbs flowered and only one plant matched the photo. Amsterdam city and the KAVB have reported the flower sellers to the Dutch consumer authority ACM for \u2018misleading sales\u2019.\n\nRen\u00e9 le Clercq, chairman of the KAVB, called for urgent action to eradicate what he described as a long-practised scam. \u201cMillions of tourists and day trippers are victims each year,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut the tulip is our national symbol, bulb trade is important for the Dutch economy and we are horrified that organised scammers are misleading consumers and damaging the sector\u2019s image.\u201d", "description": "A major investigation into the \u2018floating flower market\u2019 tourist attraction in Amsterdam has found that only one per cent of the bulbs on sale actually flowered \u2013 and not a single one matched the picture on the packet.", "authors": ["Senay Boztas", "Tom Harris", "Norman Tebbit"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000124675173-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqjwqlRemTWOSPdiwg_JXUFAGhI8CKnw5kFJRET2WGjk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
