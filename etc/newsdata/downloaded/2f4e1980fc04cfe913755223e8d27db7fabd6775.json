Here\u2019s Why.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nIn Disney CEO Bob Iger\u2019s new book, The Ride of a Lifetime, he makes the comment that his company might have merged with Apple if Steve Jobs were still alive. There is logic in the idea; you may remember that Jobs was once Disney\u2019s largest shareholder, the result of the 2006 Disney acquisition of Pixar.\n\nIn a blog post, media analysts Rich Greenfield, Brandon Ross, and Mark Kelley from the new research firm Lightshed Partners engage in a thought experiment: Could the two giant companies still come together and live happily ever after?\n\n\u201cWe understand why Disney and Iger would have wanted Apple to buy Disney, as it would have been the perfect \u2018fairy tale\u2019 ending to Iger\u2019s run as Chairman and CEO of Disney,\u201d they write. \u201cThink about it from Disney\u2019s perspective: build up the world\u2019s most prized collection of content, brands and franchises and sell it to one of the world\u2019s most innovative technology companies that understands how to marry together hardware and software (content) better than any other company.\u201d\n\nAnd then they proceed to blow up the idea, offering a list of seven reasons why Apple (ticker: AAPL) is unlikely to be interested in buying Disney (DIS).\n\n1. Cord-cutting. Buying Disney would make Apple one of world\u2019s largest owners of cable networks\u2014plus a major broadcast network in ABC. The analysts note that Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken repeatedly about \u201cthe legacy bundle breaking down at an accelerating pace.\u201d\n\n2. Legacy film-release window. They note that Disney is committed to the old-school theatrical release window for new feature films, \u201cwhereas Apple is focused on breaking legacy windowing.\u201d\n\n3. Complex legacy licensing. Past licensing deals slow Disney\u2019s ability to offer streaming network Disney+ globally \u201cand makes Hulu even harder to expand overseas.\u201d HBO has to pay cable rights to the films from Disney\u2019s newly acquired Fox unit for the next few years.\n\n4. Regional sports rights. The analysts argue that it makes far more sense for Apple to spend on original programming than to own \u201cabsurdly expensive\u201d regional sports programming with limited reach.\n\n5. Ambitious creatives will still work for Apple. \u201cGiven the size of Apple\u2019s balance sheet to finance original programming and their massive global installed base to promote the service to, we expect Hollywood talent/projects will want to work with Apple, regardless of whether they acquire a major studio,\u201d they write.\n\n6. Lack of interest in targeted advertising. The analysts note that while Disney is increasingly focused on advanced solutions to better target advertising across their linear and digital platforms, Apple is trying to make it more difficult for users of their devices to be tracked and targeted with ads.\n\n7. Theme parks and consumer products a bad fit. \u201cIt is difficult to understand why Apple would want to be making toy lightsabers and princess outfits to sell at retail,\u201d they write.\n\nThe analysts conclude: \u201cWe simply do not believe an Apple acquisition of Disney should or will occur.\u201d\n\nWrite to Eric J.
