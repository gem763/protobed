Now I feel embarrassed,' Neely told the Houston Chronicle.\n\nDonald Neely's arrested for criminal trespass on August 3 in Galveston, Texas caused outrage after footage emerged of police leading him by rope\n\nNeely, who has been living on the streets since 2016, has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nHe said he hopes the image of him handcuffed and being led through the streets of Galveston will prompt a broader conversation about how police handle mentally ill suspects.\n\nFootage shared online of the two officers leading Neely by rope - reminiscent of pictures showing slaves in chains - has sparked a wave of public outrage.\n\nIn the body cam video, one officer can be heard twice saying that leading Neely by rope down city streets would look 'bad'.\n\nA Texas Rangers investigation determined the officers didn't break the law. The Galveston County Sheriff's Office also conducted a review.\n\nGalveston Police Chief Vernon Hale, who is black, said on Friday that he is reviewing the sheriff's department report on the arrest to determine whether any further action will be taken against the two officers.\n\nThe 43-year-old said he wasn't initially embarrassed when he was walking between the officers' horses but that changed after he saw his arrest on police body camera footage that was released publicly on Wednesday\n\nIn the body cam video, which was only released publicly last week, one officer can be heard twice saying that leading Neely by rope down city streets would look 'bad'\n\nHe said the officers could have handled Neely's arrest better but added that they did a good job of keeping Neely calm during the process.\n\nNeely said he doesn't harbor any ill will toward the officers but he believes it's a waste of time and money to arrest him when he isn't harming anyone.\n\nHe has been arrested nearly 50 times, mostly for trespassing.\n\nNeely said he doesn't harbor any ill will toward the officers but he believes it's a waste of time and money to arrest him when he isn't harming anyone. He has been arrested nearly 50 times, mostly for trespassing\n\nNeely's attorney, Julie Ketterman, said her client's treatment was unacceptable and she is considering filing a lawsuit alleging his civil rights were violated.\n\nBefore his arrest last month, Neely had repeatedly resisted his family's efforts to bring him home. But since then, he has begun piecing his life back together.\n\nHe entered a Houston treatment center for three weeks, moved in with his sister, Taranette, and her family, and is taking daily medication.\n\nThe oldest of five siblings, Neely moved with his family from Florida to Texas City during childhood and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at a young age.\n\nHe was treated as a problem child by the education system, shuffled in and out of classes for students with behavioral problems during high school, his sister said.\n\nNeely dropped out of school and got caught up in petty crime.\n\nNeely said he refuses to view his mental illness as a reason for shame.\n\n'It's a title,' Neely said. 'It's not authentic. It's not going to stick. Every time they label me with a mental illness or as a paranoid schizophrenic, it rolls straight off.'", "description": "Donald Neely's arrested for criminal trespass on August 3 in\u00a0Galveston, Texas caused outrage after footage emerged of police leading him by rope.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/14/19361780-0-image-a-3_1570368464973.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
