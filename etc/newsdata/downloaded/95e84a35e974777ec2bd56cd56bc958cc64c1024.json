The prime minister has repeatedly promised to deliver Brexit by October 31 \"do or die.\"\n\nEarlier this month MPs sought to prevent the U.K. from leaving the EU without a deal by passing a new law \u2014 the Benn Act \u2014 forcing the prime minister to ask Brussels for an extension to negotiations if no deal is agreed by the time of the European Council summit in October.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to take Johnson's bait, arguing that first his party wants to ensure the prime minister could not take the country out of the EU without a deal.\n\n\u201cHe says he wants a general election. I want an election. It\u2019s very simple \u2014 if you want an election, if he wants an election, get an extension [to Brexit negotiations] and let\u2019s have an election,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nOther opposition parties also rejected the government\u2019s offer.\n\nThe Scottish National Party\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the opposition would not trigger a vote of no confidence until MPs had \u201cremoved the threat of no-deal,\u201d saying the prime minister could not be trusted. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said their party would not be accepting Johnson\u2019s offer. Other opposition parties are expected to follow suit.\n\nTheir refusal leaves the Brexit process deadlocked. Johnson continues to pursue a new deal with the EU, while insisting the U.K. will leave on October 31 without one if necessary.\n\nJohnson also said the government would comply with the law, despite the fact the Benn Act would prevent the U.K. leaving on October 31 without a deal, so long as the EU agrees to the extension when requested. Government spokespeople declined to explain how the prime minister intends to abide by the law, while also remaining committed to the October 31 date in all circumstances.\n\nJohnson faced questions in the House of Commons the day after judges at the Supreme Court ruled that the prime minister's advice to the queen to suspend parliament for five weeks was \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister accused MPs of trying to block Brexit and said that by passing a law preventing a no-deal Brexit, parliament was undermining the U.K.'s position in negotiations with Brussels.\n\n\u201cI was told there was no chance of a new deal [with the EU27], but we are discussing a new deal \u2026 this is in spite the best efforts of \u2026 this parliament to wreck our negotiations by their attempts to take no-deal off the table,\u201d he said.\n\n\"This parliament must either stand aside and either let this government get Brexit done or bring a vote of confidence and finally face a day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d\n\nIn heated, often unruly exchanges in the House of Commons, Johnson was condemned by opposition MPs for his actions and his rhetoric, with some saying the Supreme Court decision had triggered a spike in online abuse.\n\nLabour MP Paula Sherriff condemned what she called the prime minister\u2019s \u201cinflammatory\u201d description of the Benn Act as a \u201csurrender act.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of us [are] subject to death threats and abuse every single day and let me tell the prime minister they often quote his words, \u2018surrender act\u2019, \u2018betrayal\u2019, \u2018traitor.\u2019 We must moderate our language and it must come from the prime minister first,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson responded: \u201cI have never heard such humbug in all my life.\u201d\n\nHowever, he agreed that \u201ctempers have become very ragged across the country and people feel the fever of Brexit has gone on too long,\u201d but said \u201cthe best way to sort this out was to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Conservative officials confirmed they intend the party\u2019s annual conference to go ahead, and indicated that a motion would be put forward on Thursday seeking a three-day parliamentary break next week to enable Conservative MPs to attend.\n\nEarlier, Corbyn told the BBC his party would not back a request for a break. \u201cI won\u2019t support anything that shuts down parliament until it is absolutely clear that the government will abide by the law and apply for an extension,\" the leader of the opposition said on BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" program.", "description": "Prime minister asks Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018Does he in his heart even want to be prime minister any more?\u2019", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Kate Day"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170982568-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
