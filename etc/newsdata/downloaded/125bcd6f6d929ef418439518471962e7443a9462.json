The mission \u2014 called Dragonfly \u2014 received a coveted funding slot from NASA\u2019s New Frontiers program, which funds ambitious missions to explore objects in our Solar System.\n\n\u201cDragonfly is a Mars rover-sized drone that will be able to fly from place to place on Titan,\u201d Elizabeth \u201cZibi\u201d Turtle, the lead investigator of the mission, said in a briefing. The 10-foot-long, and 10-foot-wide dual-quadcopter will look like a giant drone, with eight rotors helping it soar across the moon\u2019s surface for about 8 or 9 miles (12-14 kilometers) in under an hour. It will make one of these \u201chops\u201d about once every 16 days, scouting out future landing sites, spending a lot of time sampling the surface, and observing the weather. It will also be able to make shorter hops of just a few feet if the scientists spot something interesting near a landing site.\n\nOn Titan, it\u2019s actually easier for a vehicle to fly than to roll in order to get to all the different places that the scientists would like to explore. Titan\u2019s gravity is just a seventh of Earth\u2019s and the atmosphere is four times thicker than our planet\u2019s. That makes it perfect for flying. \u201cIf you put on wings, you\u2019d be able to fly on Titan,\u201d Turtle says.\n\n\u201cIf you put on wings, you\u2019d be able to fly on Titan\u201d\n\nDragonfly was one of two finalists being considered for the New Frontiers award. The other, CAESAR, led by Steve Squyres at Cornell University, would have aimed to grab a piece of a comet\u2019s surface and bring it back to Earth. \u201cFor the comet sample return mission unfortunately the race is over.\u201d Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA\u2019s Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate said during a press conference. But he also added that other funding opportunities would open up in the future. \u201cSome of the best ideas take multiple shots on goal before they become a reality,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two missions had already made it through several competitive rounds before the final decision. New Frontiers missions generally cost around $850 million to develop, making them slightly pricier than the agency\u2019s Discovery missions, like the Mars InSight lander, which cost about $814 million, or the Dawn spacecraft which cost $500 million.\n\nOnly three other missions have been funded through the New Frontiers program. The Juno spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, has been observing the giant planet\u2019s roiling atmosphere and magnetic field. New Horizons wooshed by Pluto in 2015, and flew by a Kuiper Belt object in December of 2018. And OSIRIS-REx, an asteroid-sampling mission, is currently in orbit around the asteroid Bennu, looking for a safe place to grab a sample next year.\n\nLike those missions, Dragonfly is expected to expand our view of distant objects in the solar system \u2014 in this case, Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, whose bizarre chemistry and thick atmosphere have intrigued scientists for years. (It is the only moon in our system to boast a substantial atmosphere.) The Huygens probe, carried by Cassini, gave us a first glimpse of the moon\u2019s surface. Then, Cassini itself revealed that Titan had lakes of liquid methane on the surface \u2014 making it the only other body in our Solar System to boast substantial bodies of liquid on its surface besides Earth. Dragonfly\u2019s ability to travel across the surface will let researchers visit several interesting sites over the course of the planned two-year mission, traveling about 108 miles (175 kilometers) during that time.\n\n\u201cthe largest Zen gardens in the Solar System\u201d\n\nIts first target will be a soft sea of sand dunes that offers a safe landing site. Turtle describes them as \u201cBasically the largest Zen gardens in the Solar System wrapped around almost the entire equatorial region.\u201d From there, Dragonfly, powered by a nuclear generator and onboard batteries, will eventually make its way to Selk crater, taking pictures and samples along the way.\n\nThe spacecraft will be loaded with scientific equipment. The researchers are interested in Titan\u2019s geology (could there be ice volcanoes or Titanquakes?) but they\u2019re also really interested in its chemistry. Like any mission to another world, they\u2019ll be looking for evidence of life, but they\u2019ll also be interested to see how these chemicals interact on their own. Those observations could give us a window into how similar materials might have interacted on Earth before life developed here.\n\n\u201cTitan is just a perfect chemical laboratory to understand prebiotic chemistry \u2014 the chemistry that occurred before chemistry took the step to biology,\u201d Turtle says. \u201cIngredients that we know are necessary for the development of life as we know it are sitting on the surface of Titan.\u201d Those ingredients include organic molecules on the surface, sunlight and evidence of water hanging out on the surface in the past. All of those factors come together in Selk crater, making it a tantalizing science destination.\n\nDragonfly is set to launch in 2026 and won\u2019t land on Titan until 2034, so we\u2019ll have to wait a long time to get our first images of the mission\u2019s insect-eye view of another world.\n\nCorrection 6/29: This story has been updated to clarify that Titan and Earth are currently the only bodies in the Solar System known to have substantial liquid on their surface \u2014 liquid has been found in other places in the solar system, often buried beneath the surface.", "description": "A new mission involving a drone-like lander will explore the surface of Saturn\u2019s moon Titan.
