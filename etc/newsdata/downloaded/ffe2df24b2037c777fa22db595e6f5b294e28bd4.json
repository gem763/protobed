He said there are 12,000 startups in Brazil, including eight new companies valued at more than $1 billion, creating more than 30,000 jobs.", "description": "Brazil's government is ready to send to Congress three new bills to foster the development of the country's telecommunications industry, including rules on deployment of antennae and data centers, ahead of a long-awaited auction for fifth-generation frequencies, an official said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Gabriela Mello", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
