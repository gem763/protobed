The book, Get Good: My Ultimate Guide to Gaming, is itself gamified; it has a progress bar, for example, near the page numbers that\u2019s akin to the one under most videos online. The text is big and pops, as they say, and the pages are broken up with the kind of interesting graphic design that you used to find inside of books at Urban Outfitters. Scattered throughout are shoutouts to Red Bull, his main sponsor.\n\nAs Ninja, the first celebrity gamer, Tyler Blevins has played Fortnite with Drake, made millions of dollars off streaming his gameplay online, and has captivated a global audience in the process. Now, Blevins has released a book that purports to help you be a better gamer \u2014 and by extension, a better human \u2014 by letting players in on what he\u2019s learned over the course of his surprisingly long and robust career.\n\nScattered throughout are shoutouts to Red Bull, his main sponsor\n\nWhile the book doesn\u2019t traffic in specifics, because that\u2019s a very easy way to become unreadably outdated in a matter of years, it is genuinely interested in providing actionable tips that aspiring Ninjas can use to skip ahead a few steps on the long road toward being a professional gamer. That journey, however, is one you have to undertake alone; finding an audience is as much a matter of luck as it is a matter of skill, and no amount of advice (or gadgets) can change that.\n\nAfter the dedication, the first thing in Get Good is a letter from Blevins that lays out what the book is intended to be: \u201can encyclopedia, by me, for gamers like us.\u201d Get Good, he says, is meant to be in active use. It\u2019s billed as a reference book, which implies that gaming, like any other academic or otherwise serious pursuit, requires some amount of study.\n\nBlevins positions the book as for everyone from \u201cbrand new\u201d gamers to \u201cgrizzled veterans\u201d \u2014 although, reading through the book, it\u2019s unclear what a veteran gamer might take away from Get Good in the first place. Presumably they already know the reason to get a wired, mechanical keyboard over a wireless membrane one, or aren\u2019t daunted by the idea that practice is different than simply playing. As Patricia Hernandez wrote in her review at Polygon: \u201cAs someone who spends time online, much of the book felt like obvious advice. If I want to get better at a game, of course I\u2019m going to review my gameplay to see how I messed up, for example.\u201d The amount of information you can fit into any book has nothing on the breadth and depth of what you can find online. (Depending on the subject, though, whether that information is any good is another matter entirely.)\n\nGet Good is another way to prolong Ninja\u2019s time in the sun\n\nThe main problem with thinking about Get Good as a book is that it isn\u2019t, in the traditional sense, a book: while it is printed and bound in hardcover, it\u2019s more a piece of branded content than it is the form we\u2019ve come to know as literature. This is not in and of itself a bad thing. Blevins is a master at extending his brand, and I came away from the book realizing that, more than anything, is his skill; he\u2019s a great gamer, but he\u2019s a fantastic marketer. Get Good is another way to prolong his time in the sun: it\u2019s well-written, the advice he gives is easy to learn but hard to stick to and master, and it\u2019s clear neither Blevins nor his ghostwriter \u2014 the excellent games journalist Will Partin \u2014 have created something that feels genuine. (They save the first Sun Tzu reference for a little under halfway through the book, which is a blessing.)\n\nBlevins grew up an hour outside Chicago, with two older brothers and a dad who liked playing video games; he was diligent at school and at work, and started taking games seriously around nine years old, when he first started playing Halo. Around a decade later, in 2009, Blevins would compete in his first professional events for the game Halo 3. He went pro; he streamed on Twitch to a rapidly growing audience; and eventually quit the Halo games for H1Z1, then for PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, and finally for Fortnite. He\u2019s been able to succeed wildly because he\u2019s mastered what\u2019s in the book, sure, but it\u2019s also because he was in the right place (streaming Fortnite) at the right time (when Fortnite blew up).\n\nGet Good has a lot of good, generic advice for growing as a person \u2014 perfect practice makes perfect; being pleasant to be around as a teammate will help you in other areas; set reasonable, achievable goals and you might actually achieve them \u2014 that some readers won\u2019t get elsewhere, and that\u2019s commendable. But if you\u2019re looking for a serious resource to help you get better, this isn\u2019t the book for you. Blevins\u2019s path to stardom is singular, as just about every road to fame tends to be, and replicating what he did won\u2019t magically turn you into him.\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent, on the other hand, or the kind of person who wrings their hands about what\u2019s happening to Kids These Days, this might be just the thing that reassures you they\u2019re just fine. Blevins, after all, is the mostly squeaky-clean entertainer that kids and parents alike can enjoy; to the public, he\u2019s the face of gaming, and he knows it. Get Good is a dispatch from gamer Mount Olympus, which means it\u2019s for the fans. It\u2019s the kind of object a completist would own, one that signals membership in a tribe. It\u2019s more signifier than signified, more symbol than referent.", "description": "As Ninja, the first celebrity gamer, Tyler Blevins has played Fortnite with Drake, made millions of dollars off streaming his gameplay online, and has captivated a global audience in the process.
