Not Halbussi, not Abdel Mahdi. We want to bring down the regime,\" the protester said.\n\n- First MPs resign -\n\nRenewed protests also flooded the streets of Najaf, Hilla, Karbala and Diwaniyah in the south.\n\nIn the oil-rich port city of Basra, police enforced a strict curfew and said it arrested \"saboteurs\" who had infiltrated the protesters.\n\nThis week's demonstrations are the sequel to six days of anti-government rallies that erupted October 1.\n\nSparked by outrage at corruption, unemployment and poor services, they evolved into demands for an overhaul of the political system and a new constitution.\n\nOn Sunday, Iraqi President Barham Saleh met with the United Nations' top representative in the country Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert to discuss electoral reform and amendments to the constitution, which dates back to 2005.\n\nAbdel Mahdi has also proposed a laundry list of reforms including hiring drives, increased pensions and promises to root out corruption.\n\nOil-rich Iraq is the OPEC oil cartel's second biggest producer, but one in five people live in poverty and youth unemployment stands at 25 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nBeyond the street, Abdel Mahdi also faces new pressure from parliament, with four MPs resigning and the largest bloc holding an open-ended sit-in since Saturday night.\n\nParliament\u2019s only two Communist MPs and two lawmakers linked to former premier Haider al-Abadi announced they were stepping down late Sunday.\n\n\"We are resigning because of the protests and the way they were repressed,\" Communist lawmaker Raed Fahmy told AFP.\n\nThe Iraqi Communist Party had allied with firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in the 2018 elections to form Saeroon, which on Saturday began a sit-in to back protests.\n\nThe move has left Abdel Mahdi more squeezed than ever, as Saeroon was one of the two main sponsors of his government.\n\n- Sadr speaks -\n\nThe other was Fatah, the political arm of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force which said it would continue to back the central government.\n\nThe one-time allies now find themselves on opposite sides of the protest movement.\n\nThe Hashed was founded in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group but its factions have since been ordered to incorporate into state security services.\n\nSeveral of their offices have been torched in recent days in southern Iraqi cities, hinting at a new violent phase.\n\nDozens of protesters have died while storming or setting fire to the offices of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the Badr Organisation and others, according to medics and police.\n\nHashed commanders have threatened revenge, and its second-in-command Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis said Sunday his force \"is ready to stand against discord\".\n\nBut Sadr answered on Sunday night in his first tweet since protests resumed this week, directly addressing the Hashed.", "description": "Iraqi students joined anti-government protests in Baghdad on Sunday, ramping up the street pressure on Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi who also faced a sit-in and the first resignations from parliament.
