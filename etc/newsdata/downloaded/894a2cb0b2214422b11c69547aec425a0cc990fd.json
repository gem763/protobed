Authorities contend that in some instances the data has also been at fault, but Jakob Willer, of the country\u2019s telecoms industry association, said it was not their job to provide evidence.\n\n\u201cWe should remember: data is created to help deliver telecom services, not to control citizens or for surveillance,\u201d Willer said. He conceded it could be valuable to police, but insisted its primary purpose was to facilitate communication between users.\n\nThere are no statistics on how many court cases in Denmark are decided on the basis of mobile phone data, but it is often used to corroborate other evidence and, although not considered as reliable as DNA, has previously been seen as highly accurate.\n\nKaroline Normann, the head of the Danish law society\u2019s criminal law committee, said evidence once considered purely technical was now open to doubt. \u201cUntil now, mobile data has had a high significance and value in courtrooms because this kind of evidence has been considered almost objective,\u201d she told Agence-France Presse.\n\n\u201cThis situation has changed our mindset about cellphone data. We are probably going to question it as we normally question a witness or other types of evidence, where we consider circumstances like who produced the evidence, and why and how.\u201d\n\nIsolated incidences of clearly inaccurate mobile data have occurred in the past in the US and South Africa, but this is the first time it has been questioned by a national justice system. Three years ago a Kansas family sued a digital mapping company after being visited \u201ccountless times\u201d by police.\n\nRather than wait for their case to be examined under the review, Danish prisoners have started demanding their release on the grounds that their convictions were based on mobile phone evidence.\n\nNot all are successful. Two members of an an Aarhus criminal gang \u2013 one of whom insisted he had spent the night at his parents\u2019 home but was placed at a crime scene by mobile phone records \u2013 had their appeals turned down this week because other evidence was considered conclusive.", "description": "Denmark imposes two-month moratorium on use of mobile phone records in trials", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d5581b6aa72cdd9fb41c8038ae0717c624fd779/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6575fe21bec77b032f81262bd4cc002b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
