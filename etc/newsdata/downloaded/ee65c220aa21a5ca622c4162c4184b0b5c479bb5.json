Kyle Bochniak via unanimous decision (30-26, 30-27, 30-27)\n\nUpdated records: Woodson (7-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC), Bochniak (8-5 MMA, 2-5 UFC)\n\nKey stat: Woodson has now won four of his past fights by decision after opening his career with back-to-back finishes.\n\nWoodson on the fight\u2019s key moment\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed I couldn\u2019t get the finish. I felt like it was there multiple times, and I said that before the fight. This banged-up hand in the first round put a halt to that, so I\u2019m excited to get back in there and really show what I can do. When he kept walking forward, I just was wishing that my hand was better so that I could hit him with it. But I knew that was his style, so I just stayed focused, stuck to my jab and focused on footwork.\u201d\n\nWoodson on making the featherweight limit\n\n\u201cI used to be really fat. I used to be like 220-something pounds. I walk around about 170, and it\u2019s just there for me to lose. I\u2019m not a really muscular guy, so when it comes that time to cut the weight it comes off very easily. I was 220 fresh out of high school. I\u2019m 27 now, so I was 220 from about 18 years old to about 24. I was 220 for a good little time. A good little person. At 220, I wasn\u2019t super round or anything. I was just extra, extra chubby.\u201d\n\nWoodson on relishing his underdog role\n\n\u201cI dread the day that I become the favorite. I know that since I\u2019m undefeated and I keep winning fights, that day is going to come that I\u2019m expected to win. But if I had it my way, I would always be the underdog.\u201d\n\nWoodson on what he wants next\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my hand is broken. It\u2019s just a little banged up, so I\u2019ll be out for a few weeks and hopefully I can be back in January and stay active. I want to fight every three to four months, if possible.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Woodson, check out the video of the full post-fight interview above.", "description": "Take a look inside Sean Woodson's win over Kyle Bochniak at UFC on ESPN 6 at TD Garden in Boston.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner", "Simon Samano", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sean-woodson-ufc-boston-post-fight-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
