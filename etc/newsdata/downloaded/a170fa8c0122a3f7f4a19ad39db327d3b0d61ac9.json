(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nPresident Trump conceded Friday that Democrats had enough votes to impeach him, but he suggested that Speaker Nancy Pelosi hold a House vote to formally begin an inquiry to force a Senate trial on whether to remove him from office.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken away our rights,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday, as he capped a tumultuous week when new revelations about his administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine emerged each day. \u201cThey\u2019re all in line. Because even though many of them don\u2019t want to vote, they have no choice. They have to follow their leadership. And then we\u2019ll get it to the Senate, and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nBut even as Trump boasted of a \u201cvery unified\u201d Republican Party that would protect him from conviction, some Republicans publicly broke ranks with him Friday. At least two GOP senators and one former administration official expressed uneasiness with Trump\u2019s efforts to encourage foreign governments to investigate former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nSeparately, intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson met with lawmakers Friday to discuss a whistleblower complaint alleging abuse of power by Trump. Atkinson, a Trump appointee, previously said that the whistleblower \u201cappeared credible\u201d and that the complaint represented an \u201curgent concern\u201d worthy of Congress\u2019s immediate attention.\n\nAnd documents reviewed by The Washington Post showed that Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, defended Biden in a statement to Congress that directly undercut Trump\u2019s claims of corruption by the former vice president.\n\n\u201cI know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country,\u201d Volker said in his testimony Thursday.\n\n[Volker defends Biden as \u2018man of integrity\u2019 in testimony to Congress]\n\nTrump\u2019s concession that he would probably be impeached by the House was the latest development in what has become an ad hoc response strategy largely shaped by the president\u2019s impulses. Since Democrats announced their inquiry last week, Trump has shown flashes of anger, frustration, aggression, defiance and even indifference.\n\nOn Friday, Trump continued to take a combative stance and cast himself as a victim of overzealous Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019ve been treated very unfairly, very different from anybody else,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said he would spell out his complaints in a letter to Pelosi (D-Calif.), whom Republicans have increasingly accused of short-circuiting the formal impeachment process by not holding a vote on the House floor to launch an inquiry.\n\nThe process-based argument has become a central part of the GOP response to the impeachment debate, with few Republicans publicly defending Trump\u2019s behavior or his assertion that he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask foreign governments to investigate his political opponents.\n\n[Live updates: House committees ask Pence to turn over Ukraine information for impeachment probe]\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats have ramped up their inquiry, interviewing key Trump administration officials and issuing subpoenas as part of their probe of the president\u2019s dealings with the Ukrainian government. On Friday, three House committees subpoenaed the White House for documents and wrote a letter to Vice President Pence, demanding that he turn over documents related to his talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe letter called for Pence to deliver documents by Oct. 15 to explain what role he had in the White House\u2019s effort to pressure Zelensky to open investigations of Trump\u2019s political opponents. Pence met with Zelensky last month in Poland as the White House was withholding nearly $400 million in aid approved for Ukraine.\n\nPence\u2019s office dismissed the request as unserious.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the Vice President received the letter after it was released to the media and it has been forwarded to Counsel\u2019s Office for a response,\u201d Katie Waldman, spokeswoman for the vice president\u2019s office, said in a statement. \u201cGiven the scope, it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are investigating whether Trump or others in his administration linked the release of the aid to the president\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nDuring a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump pushed for Ukrainian prosecutors to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani on an investigation of alleged corruption by the Bidens.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to find a consistent defense of Trump in the wake of the whistleblower\u2019s report, which was published last week. The anonymous whistleblower claimed that Trump pushed for the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rival, allegations that have been confirmed as the congressional probe has uncovered text messages, internal documents and sworn testimony from the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cDemocrat House members cannot be allowed to hide behind @SpeakerPelosi when it comes to an impeachment inquiry of President @realdonaldTrump,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted Friday. \u201cThey should \u2014 and must \u2014 vote to open an inquiry of impeachment so their CONSTITUENTS, COUNTRY, and HISTORY can evaluate their actions.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sent a letter to Pelosi on Thursday requesting that she suspend the impeachment inquiry and ensure that the full House be allowed to vote on whether to proceed. McCarthy said that Pelosi risked creating \u201ca process completely devoid of any merit or legitimacy\u201d if she did not follow specific guidelines to give \u201cthe bare minimum rights granted to his predecessors.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Pelosi said holding a vote on the House floor was an option but not a requirement for proceeding with an inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing anyplace that says that we should. However, the people who are most afraid of a vote on the floor are the Republicans,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re beating their tom toms like they want it, but they don\u2019t. They have the most to be concerned about because for some of their members, to say that we shouldn\u2019t go forward with this is a bad vote.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have spoken out against Trump\u2019s behavior. After the president said Thursday that China should also investigate Biden, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said it was \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement Friday.\n\n[Trump\u2019s removal would require Republican dissidents. But those who speak out become targets of viral disinformation.]\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who is up for reelection next year, distanced himself from Trump\u2019s call for a Chinese investigation targeting Biden.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth,\u201d he said in a statement to the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) did not defend Trump but said he did not take the president\u2019s calls for foreign investigation of political rivals seriously.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real request,\u201d he told reporters Friday.\n\nBut the release of several text messages from the State Department late Thursday revealed a concerted effort to push Ukraine to begin the investigations desired by Trump.\n\nThe texts show how Volker and other State Department officials coordinated with Zelensky\u2019s top aide and Giuliani to leverage a potential summit between Trump and Zelensky on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate Burisma.\n\nIn his statement to Congress, Volker said his efforts to persuade Trump to support Zelensky were undermined by information that Giuliani and others had been feeding the president about corruption. Trump has since linked those corruption allegations to Biden, calling for an investigation.\n\nTexts among Volker, Giuliani and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, showed that the men coordinated on a draft statement for the Ukrainians in an effort to satisfy Trump\u2019s demands. After sending it to Giuliani, who wanted an explicit reference to Burisma and the 2016 election investigation, Volker and Sondland messaged back and forth to work up the text to send back to the Ukrainians, according to Volker. The Ukrainians ultimately did not agree to the statement upon receiving that version.\n\nAt least one U.S. official, William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, the charges d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, voiced concern about an apparent quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted Sondland on Sept. 9, complaining that the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine had already created a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland replied.\n\nOn Friday, Trump defended the texts by referring to Sondland\u2019s statement. \u201cHe said, by the way, there\u2019s \u2018no quid pro quo,\u2019 \u201d the president said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKaren Tumulty, Paul Sonne and Greg Jaffe contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Even as the president boasted of a \u201cunified\u201d GOP, some Republicans publicly broke ranks with him.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "October At Pm", "Toluse", "Tolu", "Olorunnipa Is A White House Reporter For The Washington Post.
