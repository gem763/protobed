He should keep his opinions to Japanese football\", while Wenger once insisted he would \"never speak about that man again\".\n\nBut speaking on Sunday night, Ferguson was effusive in his praise of Wenger.\n\nAddressing his old adversary via video, Ferguson said: \"The career you had as a manager at Arsenal was absolutely fantastic - an absolute legend.\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\n\"I loved the competition against you. We had some great times and it's wonderful you're getting this award tonight. So good luck, my blessing with you.\"\n\nFerguson himself has been a past recipient of the 'Legends of Football' award, which has been handed out since 1996.\n\nOthers who have been honoured include Kenny Dalglish, Alan Shearer, Eric Cantona, Jose Mourinho, Ryan Giggs, Pele, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, with the annual dinner having raised \u00a38million for the Nordoff Robins music therapy charity.", "description": "United legend said he 'loved the competition' as old adversary was named a Legend of Football", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Man Utd Via Getty", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12493904.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Manchester-United-v-Arsenal-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
