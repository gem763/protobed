Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nThe conservative YouTuber risked his 4.18 million-strong channel by directly taking on the social media giant\u2019s meddling in news cycles.\n\nAt issue were search results around the world for Ms. Gabbard, the Hawaii Democrat who is vying to become the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nominee, and claims by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that she is a \u201cfavorite\u201d with \u201cthe Russians,\u201d who are grooming her to run a spoiler third-party candidacy.\n\n\u201cWe decided to again, while Tulsi Gabbard was in the spotlight, run some comparative searches on YouTube,\u201d Mr. Crowder said Tuesday. \u201cWhen we set our VPN \u2026 to a non-United States country and we searched for Tulsi Gabbard [on Friday], her channel and the videos from her channel all showed up first. Yet, again, when we switched our searches to the United States, however, nothing. Exclusively in the United States, the country in which she is currently running for president, you would receive no results from Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s channel or her videos until scrolling past the first page.\u201d\n\nMr. Crowder noted Ms. Gabbard\u2019s Twitter popularity, something that would suggest it\u2019d be easy to find her YouTube channel.\n\n\u201cSo, that Friday, she\u2019s trending [number] one on Twitter, all of the sudden \u2014 boom. Valve is pinched. You can\u2019t find her exclusively in the United States. You can if you\u2019re in Germany. You can if you\u2019re in Spain. United States, however? Nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Crowder, who shared evidence of his experiments, said that YouTube changed its algorithm once the news cycle died down Sunday.\n\n\u201cLet me say this: Tulsi Gabbard is not my candidate,\u201d the host said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote for her. But this, this is chilling \u2026 I don\u2019t know if anyone else has proof that there is someone who flips a switch on YouTube to make your channel a part of the preferred channels network, whatever the hell it\u2019s called \u2026 This reeks of election meddling.\u201d\n\nThe conservative added that what he witnessed is \u201chair-raisingly scary\u201d for viewers who care about free speech and fair elections.\n\nMs. Gabbard responded to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Russia theories on Friday by calling her \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton specifically told David Plouffe, while not yet mentioning Ms. Gabbard by name on the \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast, that \u201cshe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d She went on to say that Green Party candidate Jill Stein \u201calso\u201d was a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nNick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said \u201cif the nesting doll fits\u201d when asked whether the former secretary of state was talking about Ms. Gabbard, NBC News reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
