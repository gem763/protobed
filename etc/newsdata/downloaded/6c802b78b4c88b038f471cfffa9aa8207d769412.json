Ilhan Omar Is Divorcing Her Husband, with Whom She Shares 3 Kids: 'a Difficult Time'", "language": "en", "text": "Freshman Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who burst into the national spotlight last fall as part of a wave of trailblazing lawmakers in Congress, is divorcing her husband, Ahmed Hirsi, PEOPLE confirms.\n\nThe divorce petition, which was first reported by TMZ, was filed on Friday (also Omar\u2019s birthday), court records show.\n\nOmar, 37, cited \u201cirretrievable breakdown of the marriage relationship,\u201d according to TMZ, and is seeking joint custody of her three children with Hirsi, 39.\n\n\u201cAs with all marriages, this is intensely personal and a difficult time for their family,\u201d her attorney, Jaime Driggs, said in a statement to TMZ and other media outlets, adding, \u201cJust like any other family navigating this kind of transition, Ilhan wishes to have their privacy respected for themselves and their children and will not be commenting any further.\u201d\n\nDriggs also cited what he called years of \u201cspeculation and innuendo from political opponents and the media\u201d which had \u201ctaken a significant toll on Ilhan, Ahmed, and their three children.\u201d\n\nHe was apparently referring, in part, to headlines this year based on court documents from a political consultant\u2019s estranged wife who alleged as part of their own divorce that Omar had an affair with the consultant.\n\nThe consultant reportedly denied this, charging the accusation was part of a smear campaign.\n\nSeparately, in 2016, Omar shot down the claim spread in some right-wing circles \u2014 which she called \u201cabsurd and offensive\u201d \u2014 that her previous husband, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, was actually her brother and the two had really wed to advance his own immigration case.\n\nReached on Monday, a congressional spokeswoman for Omar declined to comment on the pending divorce; her attorney did not immediately return a call. Hirsi could not be reached.\n\nRELATED: Meet \u2018the Squad\u2019 \u2014 The Four Democratic Congresswomen of Color Trump Blasted in Racist Tweets\n\nFrom left: Ahmed Hirsi and Rep.
