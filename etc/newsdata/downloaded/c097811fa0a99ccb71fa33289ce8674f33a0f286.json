But when writers start discreetly attacking politicians\u2019 views based largely on an examination of their faith, this creates a new norm in American politics that threatens to degrade people of faith everywhere.\n\nTom LoBianco\u2019s new book, \u201cPiety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House,\u201d claims to examine Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s political career and the effect his faith has had on it. Rather than provide facts that allow the reader to draw her own conclusions, Mr. LoBianco attempts to highlight Mr. Pence\u2019s faith journey in relation to his political ambitions. This correlation dismisses the genuine importance of one\u2019s personal faith, and instead insists that personal gain is the main reason for holding religious views at all. This creates a cultural conversation in the United States that undermines religious freedom and stunts the ability of religious people to feel comfortable expressing their beliefs.\n\nWithin the political sphere, religion is a large part of the discussion \u2014 and understandably so. During election season, voters often want to hear about candidates\u2019 religious beliefs, because it gives them insight into their decision-making process. Indeed, the effects Christianity and religion have had on politics can be traced throughout the course of American history. A dissection of the correlation between Mr. Pence\u2019s personal faith and political journey may provide interesting insights into the cultural landscape of much of the United States. However, when this examination instead becomes a judgment of an individual\u2019s path it leads to a generalizing assumption of his motivation. Then, it is no longer analytical research, but lazy stereotyping within reporting that can have harmful results.\n\nPoliticians aren\u2019t the ones who will be most negatively impacted from this type of attack. They are public figures; they sign up for this; and they can take it. The reverberations will be felt among people of all religions, who feel increasingly silenced by the media with every loud criticism of their views.\n\nThis public dismissal of religion is having damaging effects on the younger generation, as well. A recent study by the American Psychological Association found that rates of adolescents who experienced a \u201cmajor depressive episode in the last year\u201d increased 52 percent from 2005 to 2017 and 63 percent among young adults ages 18\u201325. Alongside this pattern is the decrease in people who align with a religious faith. A Pew Research Study shows that from 2007 to 2014, those who answered that they \u201cbelieved in God\u201d and were \u201cabsolutely certain\u201d declined from 71 percent to 63 percent.\n\nYoung people continue to have the same questions about God that human beings have asked for centuries, yet they feel an unwillingness to broach these issues due to the public denouncement of religious groups in recent years.\n\nThe climate in the media is one that provides an underlying implication to them: Their questions about a higher power are unwelcome, unnecessary and unintelligent. Therefore, as they grapple with questions about universal ideas, they have little space to voice these queries. This leads to a heartbreaking level of fatigue and isolation that should be seen as a cautionary tale of where our civilization is going. When we ignore the questions that have historically driven thoughtful inquiries and resulted in deeper human connection, we miss a crucial opportunity for growth and stunt the insights of future leaders.\n\nIn his book, Mr. LoBianco writes,\n\n\u201cThe answer to the question of which style of Christianity Pence espouses and how that influences his policies is not as clean-cut as either progressives or conservatives would present \u2026 And those answers have everything to do with why he stands so firmly by Donald Trump. That\u2019s the piety part of this book, and so explains the power.\u201d\n\nMr. LoBianco not only includes many factual errors in his book, but more importantly, he misunderstands the sincerity of Mr. Pence\u2019s faith and makes a generalization about the intent behind his convictions. Rather than start a conversation about religion and politics in America, Mr. LoBianco contributes to the resounding gong of disrespect for faith that Americans hear from the media on a daily basis.\n\nPerhaps he should consider the possibility that religious people do, in fact, believe what they say they do. For many, there is such a thing as servant leadership, prayer and faith.\n\nThese qualities aren\u2019t means to an end. They are a way of life, and they are powerful all by themselves.\n\n\u2022 Charlotte Pence, daughter of Vice President Mike Pence, is a student at Harvard Divinity School.
