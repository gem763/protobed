But perhaps the most out-there costume of all this season is the Ladybug. Which celebrity is behind this insect's red-and-black ensemble? We think we have a really good idea ...\n\nWho is the Lady Bug on The Masked Singer?\n\nView photos Photo credit: Fox More\n\nWhile we don't have much to go off of at the moment, we think a few clues point to actress Mariska Hargitay being the Ladybug on The Masked Singer.\n\nLet's look at what we do know:\n\nThe Ladybug is a woman\n\nShe was introduced at the 2019 Emmy Awards\n\nA ladybug symbolizes good luck\n\n\n\nThe singing insect flaunts '80s-like shoulder pads in the shape of ladybugs.\n\nThe Ladybug also has some ruby-red stones on her gown.\n\nFirst off, The Masked Singer didn't reveal the Ladybug's costume until the night of the 2019 Emmy Awards. And when the Ladybug did step out for a moment on the red carpet, judge Jenny McCarthy announced that \"she\" would be a \"fan favorite.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ladybug's introduction at the Emmys seems to be its own clue \u2014 in other words, the celebrity underneath the insect costume is an Emmy-winning actress. If this was, in fact, meant to be a clue, it fits nicely with Mariska's Emmy history. Back in 2006, Mariska won the Emmy for playing Detective Olivia Benson in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. What's more, she's been nominated a whopping eight times for that same role.\n\nWhy a ladybug, though? Ladybugs are generally recognized to be a sign of good luck and fortune. Mariska has opened up in the past about how she feels lucky, despite her right lung collapsing while on the set of Law and Order and losing her mother, Jayne Mansfield, in a car accident when she was three.\n\n\"I have so many blessings, and I've learned from all of my experiences and my losses. I think you learn to feel grateful when you are exposed at such a young age to the fact that bad things can happen,\" she told Redbook. \"I look at all the things life has allowed me to do and I feel like the luckiest person in the world.\"\n\nView photos Photo credit: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin More\n\nKeeping all of that in mind, we turn to our last two (possible) outfit clues \u2014 the '80s-esque ladybug shoulder pads and ruby-colored stones. As for the shoulder pads, this could be a nod to the fact that Mariska started off her career in the '80s competing in Miss U.S.A. pageants and being cast in Falcon Crest and Downtown.\n\nAnd the jewels? Mariska was born on January 23. The birthstone of January is garnet, which appears to be what's on the Ladybug's costume.\n\nDid we convince you? Even if we didn't, you have to admit that it's a solid theory for the time being.\n\n\n\nFor can't-miss news, expert beauty advice, genius home solutions, delicious recipes, and lots more, sign up for the Good Housekeeping newsletter.\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The Ladybug's costume is a major giveaway.", "authors": ["Kayla Keegan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QLrnVXy3WGoa5T6XoVVIig--~B/aD01MzY7dz0xMDc0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/good_housekeeping_561/37579398c71674c87d53b1442dee39d4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
