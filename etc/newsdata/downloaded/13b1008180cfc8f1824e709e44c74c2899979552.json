It is 12 weeks this Saturday. I am in prime physical condition. I have agreed the date with the company,\u201d McGregor said, adding that he knows his opponent\u2019s name but won\u2019t reveal it. \u201cIf I was to give you people the name, which I would love to do, I know the UFC would flip it because they are a crafty company.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old McGregor hasn\u2019t fought since losing by submission to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018. He was banned for six months and fined $50,000 for his part in a post-fight brawl.\n\nMcGregor said he is targeting two more fights, including a rematch with Nurmagomedov in Moscow. He also aimed a string of insults at the Russian fighter.\n\nAfter the Jan. 18 fight, McGregor said he would then like to fight the winner of the Nov. 3 bout between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal, followed by either Nurmagomedov or Tony Ferguson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go through the entire roster like a chain saw through butter,\u201d he said.\n\nMcGregor\u2019s return comes as he faces more legal issues. He is facing an assault charge in Ireland over an incident in which he appeared to punch a man in a bar.\n\nHe said he is planning to abstain from alcohol and late nights in the run-up to his next fight.\n\n\u201cI am focused here,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI am structured now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Conor McGregor will return to mixed martial arts in January with a UFC fight in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/russia_mcgregor_mma_70772_c0-142-3400-2125_s1200x700.jpg?6a237549351cf0fb837caf9427038bdd075b0f43", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
