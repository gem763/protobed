And I like the beach in the summer, and I have a place on the East End of Long Island.\n\nIn the Summit in New York City, we\u2019ve created a high rise that\u2019s fully amenitized. A lot of the things I like, I built into it. First and foremost, your home needs to be a place where you can relax.\n\nMore: Toronto Real Estate Investor Says Buyers Want Security\u2014Physical and Financial\u2014Above All Else\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nSG: It\u2019s not so complicated. It\u2019s the combination of two things: Having what you want at your fingertips and being pampered when you want to be. That\u2019s the theme behind Summit. It\u2019s so amenitized, you have things like a swimming pool, basketball court and private dining.\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nSG: Real luxury keeps getting improved. Technology makes our lives easier and better when done right.\n\nAnd things just keep getting better in Manhattan. It\u2019s the leader in a lot of things, so when you want to see the next best thing, you need to go to the latest best thing. The properties in Manhattan keep getting better.\n\nIn Manhattan, all the things you find in great hotels around the world end up being in residences. It\u2019s Manhattan still.\n\nMore: London Real Estate Expert Says Multimillionaires Know to Make Moves Even in a Downturn\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market now?\n\nSG: This is sort of political. The government is taxing and laying it on thick on luxury properties and the wealthy, which is deterring some developers into going into certain areas. It\u2019s becoming too costly to provide that sort of luxury.\n\nThere\u2019s the new mansion tax [in New York], and also the luxury transfer taxes, which means condos are taxed at about twice the amount of co-ops and individual houses.\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nLG: I like the East End of Long Island because of its proximity to Manhattan and its beach and fresh produce stands. I start my days out there picking blueberries, and it\u2019s something I can do with my grandchildren.\n\nFrom Penta: Objects of British and European Royal Provenance to Be Auctioned at Christie\u2019s\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nLG: It\u2019s the whole thing; it\u2019s a puzzle. You put it all together and it works. Whether I\u2019m working in my home office or relaxing, watching a baseball game, football game or watching a movie in my man cave, or downstairs working out in the gym or with the golf simulator, it\u2019s a whole great environment.\n\nMG: What best describes the theme to your home and why?\n\nLG: Modern, convenient and comfortable, in an elegant pre-war setting.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable thing in your home?\n\nLG: What makes your home is your family, but I would have to ask my wife and my grandchildren what it is that keeps them coming there and spending time there. My favorite thing is that they\u2019re there.\n\nMore: Even Agents Are Surprised at the Deals They\u2019re Seeing in the Luxury Market, Says NYC Broker\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable amenity to have in your home right now?\n\nLG: Light, air and space. That\u2019s it\u2014if you can relax and enjoy the light and air and have the space around you to do all the other things that you want.\n\nMG: What\u2019s your best piece of real estate advice?\n\nLG: My uncle, Sol Goldman, who is one of the greatest real estate people of all time, was always about location, location, location. If you have a bad piece of real estate, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do with it, you can never make that much of a difference. The location is what matters most.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the best area for investing in luxury properties?\n\nLG: Around Manhattan, it\u2019s very pro-tenant, almost socialist. And retail is difficult. But Manhattan is the most liquid market in the world. Part of investing is being able to evaluate or have liquidity in the asset.\n\nMore: Italian Architect Says a Building Should Be \u2018Timeless,\u2019 and an Apartment Should be Comfortable\n\nMG: What area currently has the best resale value?\n\nLG: That gets tricky, because I am a developer but I also buy operating properties. If I\u2019m developing from scratch, you have to go to some of the areas that were more industrial, where industry has left New York and it needs to be redeveloped. If you\u2019re talking about purchasing new buildings, anywhere in Manhattan is good, maybe downtown.\n\nMG: What\u2019s going on in the news that will have the biggest impact on the luxury real estate market?\n\nLG: The government actions in New York, which are more toward socialism than capitalism.\n\nMG: If you had a choice of living in a brand-new property versus a prime resale, which would you choose and why?\n\nLG: The answer\u2019s two-fold. If I\u2019m looking to move into it now, it would have to be a new property. It\u2019s technology current, and technology affords you conveniences and time. As opposed to having to retrofit something. Retrofitting takes so much longer. With new, you can have those modern conveniences without the wait.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-104321?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
