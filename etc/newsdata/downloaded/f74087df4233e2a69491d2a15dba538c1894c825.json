Simi's accomplishments don't end there: she graduated from Stanford's undergraduate program, and later went back for degrees in engineering and business; she worked as a sportscaster for ABC; and she was an airline pilot for 13 years.\n\nSimi revealed one key hack that allowed her to accomplish everything she set her mind to: Stay committed to one thing at a time.\n\nRead more: The president of JetBlue's venture capital firm is a renaissance woman who just might transform air travel\n\nAs part of Business Insider's ongoing Productivity Project \u2014 where we ask revolutionary businesspeople their best hacks to get things done \u2014 Simi advises readers to stay focused on individual chores. If you're \"multitasking,\" you can't devote your best effort to any task.\n\n\"I know there's people that say multitask, multitask,\" she said in a recent interview with Business Insider. \"I found that during conversations, it's best not to multitask. Team meetings are more productive if you're focused.\"\n\nFor instance, a few years ago, Simi had still been working as vice president of talent at JetBlue as she transitioned to her current role, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures. During that time, she had to bounce between her two different roles. As a result, she would think about her second job during times she was at her first, and couldn't keep up with the work.\n\nEventually, Simi realized if she stayed attentive to one project at a time, she could get more done. She turned off all her phone notifications \u2014 which she only uses for messages from her family \u2014 and put her phone away to be fully engaged in meetings with respective teams.\n\n\"It's like, all right, during these hours, while I'm at work, I'm going to focus on my current job,\" Simi said, adding that she devotes after-work hours to side projects or other responsibilities. \"It's dedicating that time to focus. Otherwise, you're not productive.\"\n\nNow, she says her best pieces of productivity advice is to turn off your phone and stay attentive to one person or project at a time.\n\n\"Be present in the moment when you're speaking to others,\" she said. \"Meetings could be shorter just by keeping all the technology away.\"", "description": "We named Bonny Simi one of our 100 People Transforming Business.
