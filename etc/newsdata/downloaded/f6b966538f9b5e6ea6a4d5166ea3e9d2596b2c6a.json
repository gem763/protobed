But when the whistleblower became worried about the way the agency was handling the information, they decided to go to Congress.\n\nAccording to The Times, the whistleblower approached an aide on the House Intelligence Committee to alert them to the accusation against Trump. At the center of the complaint is a July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which he asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for corruption.\n\nThe whistleblower believed Trump's actions constituted a \"flagrant\" abuse of power and that he was using his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nWhen the whistleblower told the committee aide of their concerns, the aide, following congressional rules, suggested the official get a lawyer to advise him to file an official complaint through the US intelligence community, The Times reported.\n\nThe aide then shared some of what the intelligence official had told them with California Rep.
