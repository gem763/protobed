The context of the trade war makes this all the more important.\n\n\"This plenum will be part of Beijing's propaganda campaign against foreign 'black hands' seeking to subvert the PRC.\"\n\nBeijing marked the 70th year of Communist rule in China earlier this month with an enormous military parade that showed off the country's military strength.\n\nBut the central government has also been shaken by months of anti-Beijing unrest in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, a slowing domestic economy, and the impact of a protracted trade impasse with the United States.\n\nChina's GDP growth slowed to six percent in the third quarter, the slowest rate in 27 years.", "description": "China's ruling Communist Party will hold a long-delayed leadership meeting next week, state media said Thursday, as Beijing battles unrest in Hong Kong, a lingering trade war, and a slowing economy.
