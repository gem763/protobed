The 30-year bond yield surged 5.9 basis points to 2.179%.\n\nThe 10-year yield for the Japanese government bond, or JGB, was up 6 basis points to negative 0.15%. The 10-year German bond yield picked up around 5. basis points to negative 0.52%.\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nGlobal bond markets reeled in the wake of an auction for Japanese government bonds. The sale saw its biggest \"tail\" for a 10-year note since 2015, a sign that the auction struggled to draw interest from market participants (link). The tail is the amount by which the highest yield the Treasury sold in the auction exceeds the highest yield expected when the auction began\n\nThis comes after the Bank of Japan indicated on Monday it could curb its bond-buying this month for large swathes of its government debt market.\n\nIn other central bank news, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates by a quarter point on Tuesday, bringing its benchmark cash rate down to a record low of 0.75%.\n\nSee: Developed central banks expected to see biggest 'synchronised easing' since 2000 (link)\n\nIn economic data, the U.S. Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector in September will be published at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists polled by MarketWatch anticipate a reading of 50.2%. The factory gauge was last seen at 49.1% in August, putting it officially into contraction territory.\n\nThe decline of U.S. manufacturing activity growth has been one of the clearest manifestations of how a global trade slowdown has weighed on economic growth. Still, spending by households and a resilient services sector has kept the impact of the U.S.-China trade war contained, so far.\n\nWhat did market participants' say?\n\nDebt \"markets are under pressure this morning, stemming from what appears to be an extremely weak bond-auction in Japan,\" wrote Ian Pollick, head of North American rates strategy at CIBC.\n\n\"This has leaked into [long-term North American bonds], as many recall that the original taper tantrum in 2014 actually began with a material rise in JGB yields,\" said Pollick.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 07:37 ET (11:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
