The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.11 points, or 0.07%, to 27,070.61, the S &P 500 lost 2.56 points, or 0.08%, to 3036.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 49.14 points, or 0.59%, to 8276.85\n\nThe Fed is expected to pare its key rate range by 25 basis point, the third such cut in what it has called a \"mid-cycle adjustment\". Investors are keen to see if policymakers will signal a shift to a pause or hint at more cuts.\n\nOn Twitter, President Donald Trump, yet again, pressed the Fed to cut rates.\n\nIn a note, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: \"In our view, the Fed will likely guide that further moves are possible, depending on the data and incoming information. Others in the market are looking for the statement to signal that the Fed is content with the current policy stance. But, in our view, this would be unnecessarily hawkish given the market is currently pricing in 40% probability of a cut at the December meeting.\"\n\nStill, BofAML said it expected \"the US economic slowdown will force the Fed to cut rates in December\" even though the Fed will likely be non-committal about future rate cuts.\n\n\"An important split from the last two meetings would be if [Fed chairman Jerome] Powell also acknowledges some slowdown in the economy, noting it is a reason for the cut,\" BofAML said. \"It would imply that the Fed is transitioning back to a more data-dependent policy.\"\n\nOn the local front, corporate news at the top of today's agenda includes a trading update from Woolworths.\n\nAs for data, it's time for third-quarter CPI. Here's what TD, NAB and Westpac are expecting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTD Securities: \"We forecast Q3 headline inflation to edge up 0.6%/q (prior 0.4%) on alcohol, food & tobacco, with fuel providing some offset. This takes annual headline CPI to 1.8% from 1.6%. Underlying inflation is expected to remain a touch below 0.4%/q, keeping core inflation ~1.5%/y. However this outcome is unlikely to trigger the RBA to cut next month.\"\n\nNAB forecasts headline and trimmed mean inflation remained unchanged at 0.4% q/q / 1.6% y/y. \"If our forecast for core inflation proves right, the Reserve Bank would likely read the data as continuing to suggest that spare capacity remains in the economy, consistent with below-trend growth and too-high unemployment. Barring a very weak outcome, the Reserve Bank is likely to remain focused on labour market developments as it aims to reach full employment, which should spark a lift in wages growth and inflation.\"\n\nWestpac is forecasting a 0.6% rise in the September quarter CPI lifting the annual pace to 1.8%yr from 1.6%yr. \"Core inflation remains well below the bottom of the RBA target band as moderating housing costs offset modest inflationary pressure elsewhere. Competitive disinflationary pressure in consumer goods is limiting the pass through of the weaker AUD though it is having some impact. Given this we find it hard to envisage core inflation breaking higher any time soon let alone returning to the mid-point of the 2%yr to 3%yr target band.\"\n\nToday's agenda\n\nLocal: CPI third quarter\n\nOverseas data: Euro zone economic confidence October, Business climate October, Consumer confidence October; US ADP employment report October, GDP third quarter annualised, Federal Reserve policy decision at 5am AEDT Thursday\n\nMarket highlights\n\nASX futures down 23 points or 0.3% to 6700 near 7.45am AEDT\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAUD +0.4% to 68.64 US cents\n\nSterling flat at $US1.2863\n\nOn Wall St near 4pm: Dow -0.1% S &P 500 -0.1% Nasdaq -0.6%\n\nIn New York: BHP -0.3% Rio +0.1% Atlassian +1.3%\n\nIn Europe: Stoxx 50 -0.1% FTSE -0.3% CAC +0.2% DAX flat\n\nNikkei 225 futures -0.1%\n\nSpot gold -0.3% to $US1488.74 an ounce at 1pm New York time\n\nBrent crude +0.6% to $US61.93 a barrel\n\nUS oil +0.1% to $US55.84 a barrel\n\nIron ore -1.5% to $US86.64 a tonne\n\nDalian iron ore -0.9% to 617 yuan\n\nLME aluminium +1% to $US1754 a tonne\n\nLME copper bid up 0.3% to $US5927 a tonne\n\n2-year yield: US 1.64% Australia 0.81%\n\n5-year yield: US 1.66% Australia 0.85%\n\n10-year yield: US 1.83% Australia 1.18% Germany -0.35%\n\n10-year US/Australia yield gap near 7.45am AEDT: 65 basis points\n\nFrom today's Financial Review\n\nHuang Xiangmo's $135m planning windfall: The Chinese billionaire stands to make $135 million profit from a Sydney planning decision, thanks to a local councillor who failed to declare a $4 million link to the developer.\n\nChanticleer: The science that shows it's hard to beat the market: As the hunt for yield gets harder, new work from Melbourne-based Professor Peter Bossaerts shows why index investing is a good bet.\n\nFundies warn Lowe that low rates are backfiring: \"If low interest rates and ease of borrowing were the foundation of strong growth, surely Japan and Europe would now be growing very strongly,\" Investors Mutual says.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe S &P 500 touched a record high on Tuesday as investors cheered strong earnings from big drug makers Merck and Pfizer, while a disappointing profit from Google parent Alphabet kept the Nasdaq firmly in the red.\n\nHopes of a US-China trade deal and expectations of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday have kept markets inching higher this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerck and Pfizer both gained after reporting upbeat third-quarter results to help keep the Dow and S &P near the flat line.
