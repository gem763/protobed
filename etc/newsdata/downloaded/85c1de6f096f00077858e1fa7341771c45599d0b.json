The Yankees, per their protocol, went to their bullpen, a decision that started the cascade of moves that would bury them two innings later. The Astros, per their protocol, stayed with their starter in the fifth, stayed with him in the sixth and stayed with him in the seventh \u2014 and were rewarded for it.\n\nOf course, any team, even the quick-triggered Yankees, might stay with their starter when their starter is Gerrit Cole.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith Cole delivering seven scoreless innings, even on a night when he was at less than his best, the Astros claimed a 4-1 victory that put them ahead 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Cole, perhaps the most valuable weapon in these entire playoffs, still hasn\u2019t been beaten since May 22, and in three starts this postseason he is 3-0 with a 0.40 ERA.\n\nThe preparation for Wednesday night\u2019s scheduled Game 4 is complicated by a terrible forecast that calls for rain, with 100 percent certainty, for much of the night. If the game is rained out, Games 4 and 5 would be Thursday and Friday, and the teams would lose the travel day scheduled for Friday. Game 6, if necessary, would be Saturday in Houston.\n\nCompleting seven innings Tuesday required Cole to pitch around nine base runners, five of whom reached by walks, tying his career high. And it included one particularly harrowing moment in that pivotal fifth inning, when, with two on and two out and the Astros leading by two, a long drive to right off the bat of Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius \u2014 which would have put the Yankees ahead had it sailed into the seats \u2014 instead died at the wall into the glove of right fielder Josh Reddick.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros got half their offense from solo homers by Jos\u00e9 Altuve in the first and Reddick in the second, both off Yankees starter Luis Severino. And they got the other half from a pair of runs in the seventh that demonstrated the risks and limitations of the Yankees\u2019 bullpen-focused blueprint.\n\nThat half-inning began with Yankees right-hander Adam Ottavino, their third reliever of the night, on the mound. But his stint lasted only two batters, a walk and a hit-and-run single. It was enough to open the door for the Astros, who eventually scored their runs on a wild pitch by Yankees lefty Zack Britton and a sacrifice fly off the bat of Yuli Gurriel.\n\nOttavino, one of the Yankees\u2019 most indispensable relievers, has lost his way at a terrible time, with nine of the 16 batters he has faced this postseason reaching base. And with the way Yankees Manager Aaron Boone continues to trust him, he may be the dreaded weak link that can bring down the Yankees\u2019 entire bullpen experiment this postseason. He left the mound Tuesday, having put two batters on base and retired none, to a chorus of boos from the crowd of 48,998.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCole jogged out to the Yankee Stadium mound for the bottom half of each inning and strolled back each time he\u2019d collected his three outs, his gait so languid he was occasionally beaten to his dugout by one of his outfielders. It was as if he couldn\u2019t wait to pitch and dreaded having to stop.\n\nThe many lineups Cole eviscerated during his historic 2019 season might have killed to have faced this version of him. It was a rare night where he seemed beatable, with the Yankees putting multiple batters on base in four of his first five innings.\n\nThough Cole\u2019s velocity was as stout as ever, with fastballs that touched triple digits, it was the rare start in which he did not seem completely overpowering. The major league leader in strikeouts, Cole didn\u2019t fan a single Yankees hitter his first time through their lineup.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Yankees were without left fielder Giancarlo Stanton, a two-time home run champ from his National League days, in their lineup for the second straight game, the result of a nagging quadriceps strain suffered in Game 1.\n\nTuesday\u2019s pivotal fifth inning began with confusion, an empty field and an unfortunate development, as home plate umpire Jeff Nelson, who had been hit in the mask by a foul tip an inning earlier, had to leave the game with a concussion. Severino, having already made his way to the mound to warm up for the inning, went back to the dugout, along with all his teammates, as second base umpire Kerwin Danley went inside to put on the chest protector and mask \u2014 a delay that took 18 minutes.\n\nSending Severino out for the fifth in the first place was a rare show of faith by Boone, who hadn\u2019t allowed one of his starters to face this part of an opponents\u2019 lineup for a third time all postseason. Severino lasted only three batters, and right-hander Chad Green had to come in and clean up a two-on, one-out mess.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCole, meanwhile, had upward of a 30-minute break between the bottom halves of the fourth and fifth innings, thanks to the umpiring change, and he narrowly avoided \u2014 by a few rotations of Gregorius\u2019s deep flyball with two on and two out that died at the right field wall \u2014 giving up the Astros\u2019 two-run lead.\n\nAt that point, the leash got shorter, even with the Astros, even with Cole. His pitch count was climbing. The bullpen was heating up. But Cole got better. He retired the next six batters in order, including four by strikeout, to carry the lead through the seventh inning.\n\nThe events of the next few days will dictate whether Cole\u2019s next start is in Game 7 of the ALCS, Game 1 or 2 of the World Series or Opening Day 2020 for whichever team hands the pending free agent the $250 million or so it might take to sign him.\n\nBut if this was Cole\u2019s \u201cbad\u201d outing \u2014 the one where he was at less than his best, and as beatable as he will ever be \u2014 woe be the team that faces him next.\n\nAD", "description": "Houston\u2019s standout right-hander walks five but navigates his way to seven shutout innings in a 4-1 win that gives Astros a 2-1 lead in series.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MeXjgEd8MYLi7i7iDkO4tko_Hbg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4VUCMEHPVII6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
