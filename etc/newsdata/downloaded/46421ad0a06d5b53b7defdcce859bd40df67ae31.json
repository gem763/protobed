Vivienne Wilson, 77, from Newmarket, Suffolk, says she received two \u00a325 prizes within a day of each other. But when she went to cash them, the second one bounced.\n\nGo paperless: NS&I says a printing issue meant around 25,000 duplicate prizes were sent out in error\n\nShe says: 'Most months I get more than one prize because I have quite a few bonds, so I thought nothing of it. When I paid them into my building society, one went through OK, but the other bounced. It was peculiar. I was really surprised because I just thought 'Government bonds don't bounce'. I would have been really disappointed if it had been a bigger prize.\n\n'When I rang NS&I to find out what had happened, the person I spoke to was very off-hand and did not even try to sound apologetic. They merely said that they'd had a 'computer glitch' and I'd been sent the cheque by mistake and was not entitled to it.'\n\nMiss Wilson said she noticed the prizes' reference numbers were the same when she went through her records. She has not had anything in writing from NS&I explaining the error. The bank confirmed it has not written to customers.\n\nAnna Bowes, co-founder of Savings Champion, says it is 'strange' that NS&I has chosen not to do so. 'It's an error and it would probably be sensible to write to everyone to explain and apologise,' she adds.\n\n'These things happen, but it's not good and they need to review why it happened and ensure it does not happen again.'\n\nMartyn James, of complaints site Resolver, says the error was embarrassing for NS&I, but warned savers sent the duplicate prize would be unlikely to have a claim to the money.\n\nHe says: 'You don't have any consumer rights if the company has made a mistake, but \u00a325 to \u00a3100 is well within the range of what businesses will sometimes offer as a goodwill gesture. If you go to NS&I and demand the money that the cheque said you'd won, you are unlikely to be successful, but if you banked the cheque and it bounced, you could tell NS&I you have been inconvenienced.\n\n'These sums of money may seem small but an increasing number of people are living on very tight budgets. It could be that someone spends the money before they find out the cheque has bounced, so it is rather embarrassing for NS&I.\n\nThe odds of winning \u00a325 per \u00a31 bond is 1 in 24,500.\n\nA spokesman for NS&I says: 'Due to a technical issue, around 25,000 duplicate Premium Bond prize warrants were issued following the October 2019 prize draw.\n\n'We are investigating this and apologise for any inconvenience caused to those customers who have been affected.\n\n'If customers do receive duplicate warrants for any prizes won in October's draw, they should pay only one of the warrants into their bank or building society account and securely destroy the other warrant.\n\n'If a customer has already paid both warrants into their bank or building society account, the money from the duplicated warrant will be returned to NS&I.'\n\nLast November, IT problems caused delays for 9,000 NS&I customers transferring money from their accounts. Some customers requesting transfers of their money have experienced a 24-hour delay.\n\nOne saver claimed that he had paid \u00a3320,000 into his NS&I account but that staff could not tell him whether it had been received.\n\nNS&I was founded in 1861 and has 25 million customers, with an average age of 57.", "description": "More than \u00a3600,000 of premium bond prize cheques were sent out by mistake last month following a technical blunder.", "authors": ["Miles Dilworth For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
