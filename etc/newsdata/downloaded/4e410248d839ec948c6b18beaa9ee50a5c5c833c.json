Holland wrote in her 1987 book \u201cOld Homes and Families of Howard County, Maryland.\u201d The 67-acre horse farm in Highland, Md., is listed at $9 million. (HomeVisit)\n\nCol. Henry Ridgeley received a land grant from King George II in 1726, and a stone cottage was built there circa 1749. It remains part of the estate. Ridgeley\u2019s son Greenberry Ridgeley began construction of the main residence in 1789. The main house was added onto in the early 1800s, likely by Greenberry\u2019s son Nicholas.\n\nSamuel Hopkins, nephew of businessman and philanthropist Johns Hopkins, bought the house from the Ridgeleys in 1877. His daughter, Alda Hopkins Clark, founded the Howard County Historical Society. His son, Samuel Harold Hopkins, was a founder and former president of the racetrack in Laurel, Md.\n\nHorses have long been an important part of Hickory Ridge. Samuel Harold Hopkins held the Horse Show at Highland on the estate, then known as Whitehall. McDaniel, a longtime Maryland racing commissioner, expanded the equestrian facilities to breed thoroughbreds.\n\n\u201cIt has proven to be outstanding from an equestrian perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nA statue of his most successful horse, Lies of Omission, can be seen from the porch. Mario Pino rode the chestnut gelding to the winner\u2019s circle in the Grade 3 Polynesian Stakes at Pimlico, in Baltimore, in 1996. The horse had 11 wins in 40 starts, earning a lifetime total of $288,669.\n\n\u201cHe was our first stakes winner,\u201d McDaniel said.\n\nWhen McDaniel stepped down as chair of the racing commission after 27 years, he was given Pimlico\u2019s finish line pole as a gift. It is on the Hickory Ridge grounds, near a paddock.\n\nThe equestrian facilities and the house\u2019s history gave McDaniel his inspiration for the estate.\n\n\u201cMy vision was to create an English manor here,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the exception of the wood-paneled library, most of the house looks more Colonial than English. But the lower level, which McDaniel calls the Jockey Club, resembles an English pub. Rough wood beams stretch across the ceiling. Rugged stone walls rise up from a brick floor. Besides the wet bar, there\u2019s a card table and a bagatelle table, a game derived from billiards. The casual space provides an escape from the formality upstairs.\n\nMcDaniel said he will miss Hickory Ridge\u2019s bucolic seclusion.\n\n\u201cOnce you get on the property, you\u2019re in a different world,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go back in time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the four-bedroom, five-bathroom, 8,084-square-foot main house, the 67-acre estate has a swimming pool, an English croquet court, a carriage house, a stone cottage, a greenhouse, horse trails, two barns with 20 stalls, a tack room, 11 double-fenced paddocks, five run-in sheds, two exercise rings, a three-car garage and a large equipment shed. It is listed at $9 million.\n\nListing: 13032 Highland Rd., Highland, Md.\n\nListing agent: Richard Watson, Long & Foster\n\nPrevious House of the Week\n\nMore Real Estate:\n\nWell-Heeled home buyers can enjoy their cuppa at Sir Thomas Lipton\u2019s Osidge\n\nWhat to know before refinancing your home loan\n\nReading the tea leaves in the real estate market", "description": "HOUSE OF THE WEEK | Horses play a major role in the story of Hickory Ridge in Howard County, Md.", "authors": ["Kathy Orton", "Reporter", "Editor Covering The Washington Metropolitan Area Housing Market"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LKM57EWX4UI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
