Number two by market cap is Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock, which dropped roughly 9.5% today on last night\u2019s quarterly results. But there\u2019s a lot more to this story behind the headlines \u2013 and a major upside catalyst on the horizon. So let\u2019s take a look.\n\nThe sell-off tells me that investors reacted to analyst expectations and not reality. Wall Street had been looking for roughly 103 million Canadian dollars in revenues, and Aurora turned in C$98.9 million.\n\nNow, first of all, only a handful of analysts follow ACB stock at this point, so it\u2019s hard to extrapolate anything meaningful from that. Today had nearly 25 million shares changing hands based on, like, five guys\u2019 opinions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSecondly, keep in mind that Aurora\u2019s revenues are growing faster than you\u2019ll see with almost any other industry.\n\nSpecifically, in this latest quarter (fiscal Q4 2019), Aurora\u2019s C$98.9 million was a 52% increase from fiscal Q3 2019 revenues of C$65.1 million. When you look at the year-ago quarter, that\u2019s a 72% increase (from C$55.2 million). And when you look at the same quarter two years ago, that\u2019s a 447% increase (from C$18.1 million).\n\nAnd then you\u2019ve got to look at future projections. In the chart below you see that the trend is still strong. For 2020, we\u2019re looking at potentially $521 million in annual revenues \u2013 more than double where we are now. And by 2022, Aurora Cannabis is projected to be a $1.7 billion company by revenue. That\u2019s just three years from now. (And that\u2019s U.S. dollars, not Canadian.)\n\nSource: YCharts\n\nSo for Aurora to miss by C$4 million \u2026 that\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Especially when you look at the bigger trend.\n\nNow, I mention this not to prove my commitment to ACB stock or really any particular cannabis company. I mention it to illustrate that the sellers today are falling into a trap that we at Investment Opportunities avoid:\n\n\u2026namely, getting caught up in short-term thinking for what should be a long-term play.\n\nAnd the sellers are about to miss out on what could be a major bullish event.\n\nGet Ready for \u201cLegalization 2.0\u201d\n\nNow is a particularly bad time to be selling Canadian pot stocks. Because \u201cLegalization 2.0\u201d is about to hit.\n\nNext month, on October 17, companies can apply for a license from Health Canada to sell cannabis edibles, beverages, and vaping products, as well as extracts and topicals. Then, 60 days later \u2013 in December \u2013 these products will actually hit the store shelves.\n\nA year into full legalization, Canada has over 200 licensed growers and sellers of the marijuana flower \u2013 for a country of less than 40 million people. If the cannabis giants want to stay dominant, there\u2019s a big opportunity among edibles and vapes in particular. These products have higher profit margins than the flower \u2013 as high as 92%. What\u2019s more, they open the doors to a deeper pool of customers\u2026 including folks more likely to use cannabis if they can do so more discreetly, without the smoke.\n\nAnd this is clearly on executives\u2019 minds. Aurora Cannabis already warned in May that it would be building up inventory, preparing to release edibles, vapes, and concentrates \u2013 and that, in fact, this buildup may hold back revenues a bit for this latest quarter.\n\nAurora\u2019s strategy here is telling. The company has made it pretty clear that this specific product line-up takes the \u201cU.S. consumer\u201d into account. And when you look at the numbers, it\u2019s obvious why.\n\nCanada is Just The Beginning\n\nThe California marijuana market alone is bigger than all of Canada\u2026 and it\u2019s growing. If and when U.S. legalization occurs, the United States will immediately become the largest market in the world. In fact, it will be bigger than the rest of the world combined.\n\nI expect federal legalization very soon \u2013 and again, you need to be invested well BEFORE a big catalyst hits.", "description": "Just a few giants still dominate the emerging cannabis industry, so it's always news when one reports earnings.
