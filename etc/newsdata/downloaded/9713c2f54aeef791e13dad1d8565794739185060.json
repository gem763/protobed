Oscar was arrested a few days later, according to reports.\n\nProsecutor Luciana Vallarella told local media that the suspect has been charged with kidnapping and assault and could be sentenced to between two and six years if found guilty.\n\nReports didn\u2019t mention whether the victim suffered sexual abuse during her 22 years in captivity, but the formal charges don\u2019t currently include a sex offence.\n\nBut Vallarella did say the woman suffered gender violence since the start of their relationship and that he regularly beat and threatened her.\n\nWhen she was a teenager and her family first learnt of the alleged abuse, they tried to intervene.\n\nThat was when the suspect first decided to keep the woman as his hostage, according to local media.\n\nHe reportedly threatened to hurt the victim\u2019s young son from a previous relationship to make her cooperate.\n\nOscar also allowed the victim to communicate with her family over the phone but told her what to say, according to Vallarella.\n\nEventually relatives came to believe she no longer wanted to keep in contact with them.\n\nThe woman was occasionally allowed to leave the house in the company of Oscar but had to shave her head and dress like a man, according to reports.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s parents have been linked to the case as possible accomplices, although it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ve been arrested yet.\n\nBoth parents lived on a different floor in the same property, so it\u2019s suspected that they must have known about the alleged kidnapping.\n\nThe suspect is being held in custody for 60 days as the investigation continues, local media reports.\n\nSources: Magazine Features\n\n(Pictures: CEN/MAGAZINEFEATURES.CO.ZA)", "description": "A 57-year-old man has been arrested for kidnapping his girlfriend and holding her captive for 22 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9002/d1282ec52c8b41d99ad1db2bc9e9a5dc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-14"}
