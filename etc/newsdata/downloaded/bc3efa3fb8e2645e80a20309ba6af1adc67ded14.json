It\u2019s a thinly-veiled shot at Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard who Democrats and several columnists have theorized is somehow connected to the Kremlin because of favorable stories written by Russia-based news organizations. A 2017 meeting between Gabbard and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is also part of the notion along with Gabbard\u2019s status as more of an anti-war candidate.\n\nGabbard\u2019s response was nothing short of amazing by challenging Clinton to run for the Democratic presidential nomination instead of pussyfooting around in the shadows. She also knocked the long failure by the Democratic Party to present any sort of foreign policy different from Republicans. MSNBC had the gall to suggest Gabbard\u2019s takedown of Clinton should be ignored because she never bothered denying any sort of connection to Russia. As if that sort of harebrained proposition deserves any sort of response outside of mockery.\n\nThe entire Gabbard-Clinton feud elicited a rather substantive response from Michigan Congressman Justin Amash concerning the 2016 election.\n\nHillary does\u2014and did\u2014drive many people into the arms of Donald Trump. Her attack on Tulsi does likewise. In my district, Trump did worse than any Republican in modern times and still beat Clinton by a fair margin. Many Ds in the Midwest rejected her. I didn\u2019t vote for either one. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 19, 2019\n\nAmash\u2019s explanation is simple: Clinton lost 2016 not because of Russian interference but because she was a horrible, completely unlikeable candidate. It\u2019s a truth Clinton and her minions seem unable and unwilling to accept. Any time Clinton and her ilk rail against Russian interference or suggest President Donald Trump wasn\u2019t legitimately elected simply plays into his hands and does nothing to bring in former Trump voters who may be on the fence for 2020. She is a Trump asset, whether she means to be one or not.\n\nThe best advice for Clinton and her allies is to stop suggesting any sort of divergence from the typical party line on foreign policy automatically means Russian influence. It\u2019s more than likely Russian-owned stations see Gabbard as friendly because she\u2019s not willing to commit U.S. troops to every potential global conflict. This reduces the chance of war with Russia, China, and Iran and potentially saves American lives. A goal worth pursuing.\n\nIt is rather odd for Clinton to go after Gabbard because her stance on foreign policy appears to be the only thing that differentiates herself from the rest of the Democratic field. After all, Gabbard is in favor of massive government intervention in the private sector whether it be on guns or the economy. She supports Medicare for all, increasing the minimum wage, and breaking up big banks. These are not exactly smaller, weaker government solutions.\n\nClinton\u2019s attack on Gabbard may have backfired. The Associated Press reported she\u2019s gotten more attention in Iowa from Democrats since the comments on Plouffe\u2019s podcast. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll shoot to the top of the poll rankings or suddenly start bringing in more endorsements since she\u2019s fighting for the same votes Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want. It might be a different story in a different election cycle, however, with fewer candidates and more philosophical differences between them. It\u2019s doubtful this will be a repeat of 1972 where George McGovern won the Democratic primary.\n\nThere is one question to consider. Let\u2019s say Gabbard suddenly sees an increase in support and outpaces candidates like Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Beto O\u2019Rourke. Would this make Clinton a Gabbard asset? One has to wonder in this wacky 2020 campaign cycle.", "description": "Hillary Clinton's attack on Tulsi Gabbard shows the former's unlikeability.
