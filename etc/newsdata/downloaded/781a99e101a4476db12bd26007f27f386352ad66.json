The incident sparked riots across the country.\n\nThe matter evokes such intense opinions on both sides because some Hindus believe that the site is the birthplace of the deity Lord Ram. They say this claim is bolstered by a 2003 archaeological survey that concluded a temple may once have stood on the ground where the 16th century mosque was built.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd the issue is finally coming to a head after the landslide re-election of Narendra Modi for a second term as prime minister in May. Mr Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist BJP campaigned on a pledge to build a new temple to Lord Ram on the demolished Babri Masjid site.\n\nThe case is effectively a land rights dispute between three parties \u2013 the state Sunni Waqf Board representing the mosque, a group of Ram-worshipping ascetics who maintain a makeshift Hindu shrine at the site, and a team of top lawyers representing the Ram Lalla deity himself. Under Indian law, a Hindu deity has the right to sue and be sued.\n\nThe Supreme Court judges have set Thursday as the deadline for the hearing to wrap up, after which a judgement is expected no later than 17 November \u2013 the day the current Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, who is presiding over the matter, retires from his post.\n\nAnd in the many days of submissions in the court in recent weeks, the matter of the archaeological evidence for an ancient temple has unexpectedly become centre-stage \u2013 a surprise, one archaeologist told The Independent, because the evidence is so flimsy.\n\nThe 2002-03 dig was carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India. Its final 574-page report found that the only structures predating the Babri Masjid Mosque on the site were a single large wall along the western edge and a network of some 50 much smaller \u201cpillar bases\u201d across the centre.\n\nIn its conclusion, the ASI stated that this was evidence of a \u201cmassive structure\u201d, and therefore that a temple to Lord Ram could have existed there in the past.\n\nYet even at the time, independent observers to the dig questioned the ASI\u2019s findings. Six or seven leading academics from Indian universities were met with hostility and given only limited access by the government agency\u2019s own archaeologists.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Seeing the surcharged atmosphere in the country, that is a dream that cannot be fulfilled.\u201d\n\nThe group is not, however, directly involved in the court case, and its proposal has been dismissed by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the largest official body representing Muslims in the country.\n\nThe board\u2019s spokesperson called the idea \u201csurrender\u201d, saying the body was \u201cconfident about the arguments and look[ing] forward to the much-awaited verdict from the court\u201d. After decades of debate, the question remains as to whether everyone in India will abide by the apex court\u2019s final decision.", "description": "India will this week wrap up a hearing on an archaeological dispute that has divided the nation for decades, pitting powerful organised religious groups against a deity itself.
