The debates have been fun so far, with Tulsi Gabbard giving Kamala Harris the shiv and Harris going after Joe Biden and his segregationist past.\n\nAs Twitchy reported, Buttigieg has recently gone after Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker, and he\u2019s also questioned Elizabeth Warren\u2019s commitment to small donors. However, The Hill is reporting that upstart Pete Buttigieg is being warned not to attack top-tier candidate Warren.\n\nNEW: Progressives fume at Buttigieg, warn him not to attack Warren at debate https://t.co/hQpZbrFVH3 pic.twitter.com/kf7eoHCLgA \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) October 14, 2019\n\nFor example, The Hill cites Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green, who tweeted this:\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see the potential self destruction of @PeteButtigieg, a rising star. Tues will be a key trajectory moment. Does he attack the next President Of The United States or take the high road & make positive waves by adding his unique voice to progressive issues of the day? https://t.co/ptXGostTsn \u2014 Adam Green (@AdamGreen) October 14, 2019\n\nWell, if he really intends to be the next president of the United States, which would explain his presence at the debate, we\u2019d hope he\u2019d lay into Warren as much as he can.\n\nJonathan Easley reports:\n\nProgressives are warning South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg not to attack Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio. Buttigieg, who has emerged as a center-left contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, has drawn the ire of progressives in recent days for remarks viewed as swipes against more liberal contenders like Warren and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas). \u2026 Progressives on Monday seized on remarks Buttigieg made to Snapchat\u2019s Peter Hamby, in which he was asked about Warren\u2019s pledge to refuse money from high-dollar donors. Warren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter, compared to $19.1 million for Buttigieg.\n\nPresident Trump \u201chas tremendous amounts of support and allies at his back, and we\u2019re not going to beat him with pocket change,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nShe can't handle Pete? \u2014 Minturner1\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41 (@Minturner11) October 14, 2019\n\nDemocrats rigging another election\u2026. \u2014 Habitual Linestepper (@FergusFSU) October 14, 2019\n\nButtigieg's quote to Hamby was 100% reasonable. It's interesting to watch other campaigns & their surrogates overreact to what he said \ud83e\udd14 He must be gaining traction & it's making other candidates nervous. \u2014 Nerdy Pursuit (@nerdypursuit) October 14, 2019\n\nYou mean Warren supporters do not like that Buttigieg considers her strategy misguided? Well it *is* misguided. Why does she want to fight with one hand tied behind her back? Makes no sense, unless it is to hobble her competition, who do not have a 10 million Senate war chest. \u2014 Sophie Amrain (@AmrainSophie) October 14, 2019\n\nButtigieg has become the candidate to least likely attack another candidate. How you interpret what he said to Hamby as a swipe at Warren or any other candidate is beyond me. It was a sensible response. \u2014 Shawn M. Griffiths (@TheShawnG) October 14, 2019\n\nHe will attack with intellectual honesty \u2013 she will talk of her time as a school teacher \u2013 Bernie will yell \u2013 and Biden will babble \u2013 see? now you dont even have to tune in \u2014 The Guy (@gatorteach55) October 14, 2019\n\nthen he should DEFINITELY attack Warren at the debate! \u2014 JudeaPride (@JudeaPride) October 14, 2019\n\nThe DNC fix is in. LOL \u2014 JFrat (@NorCalSportsFan) October 14, 2019\n\nWarren is \u201c the chosen one\u201d. \u2014 James Adkins (@adkins_james) October 14, 2019\n\nPlay nice Dems. Warren is the anointed one! \ud83d\ude44 \u2014 TrashPanda \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@TrashPa98954284) October 14, 2019\n\nWhy is everyone hands off to challenging Warren\u2019s policies? If she isn\u2019t allowed to be part of the debate then why should she show up at all. Media needs to shut up and let us decide who we want as our nominee. \u2014 Pamela Harder (@harp1114) October 14, 2019\n\nThis is how the dems ended up with HRC is 2016. How\u2019d that turn out? Why not just let everyone say what they want, to who they want, when they want to? Or is that too logical and sensible? \u2014 Thistle Blower. (@somethi79963647) October 14, 2019\n\nHer policies need to be challenged. \u201cPlans\u201d are great and all, but don\u2019t amount to a hill of beans if you can\u2019t enact them. Also, I have heard nothing from her regarding foreign policy. \u2014 Karoliina J \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee (@KaroliinaJ1) October 14, 2019\n\nShe's his competition. We're a mere handful of months from the first primaries. If he wants to win, he needs to attack his opponents' messages. \u2014 cookiet9292 (@cookiet9292) October 14, 2019\n\nHow progressive can one be if they are doling out warnings about what a candidate can and can not say? \u2014 miss glenn (@misssssssglenn) October 14, 2019\n\nLol, she\u2019s done getting a free pass. \u2014 Phillosophy (@phillyprosper) October 14, 2019\n\nDems: Get in line Pete. pic.twitter.com/ycHoI6Blks \u2014 Greg, The Beard is Gone (@Money_Moose) October 14, 2019\n\nApparently people forget that this is a primary where you are trying to beat your opponent with your ideas I can\u2019t stand Buttigieg but he should go after whoever he pleases. Same for Warren. \u2014 Southern Black Berner (@so_black_berner) October 14, 2019\n\nI'm not aware of any progressives who support Warren. Attack away, Pete. \u2014 \ud83c\udf39ThunderBern\ud83d\udd25 Now featuring improved plumbing!
