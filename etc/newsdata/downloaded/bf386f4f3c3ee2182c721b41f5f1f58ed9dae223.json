One of the earliest selfies ever taken has gone on display in a British museum - 130 years after it was snapped by an avant-garde inventor\n\nHe used it to study insects and capture detailed images of the moon through a telescope.\n\nTeasdale died in 1903 at the age of 73 while attending a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nBRIEF HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY The first photographs were developed by French inventor Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce who in 1824 creates the first permanent photograph. However the word photography was only first used in 1839 by Sir John Herschel after he created the first glass negative. The first Kodak camera was produced in 1888 allowing 'ordinary people to take photographs\n\nThe first ever selfie, which is a 'photograph taken by oneself', is considered to have been taken by American pioneer Robert Cornelius in 1839.\n\nModern selfie culture emerged in Japan in the 1990s and has exploded within the past 15 years with the dawn of social media.\n\nIt's estimated 93 million selfies are posted online every day.\n\nTeasdale's example is part of a new exhibition at Leeds Industrial Museum telling the illustrious history of engineering in the West Yorkshire city.\n\nCouncillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: 'Leeds has a very long and proud history as a centre of innovation and progress stretching back hundreds of years.\n\n'The pioneers who feature in this exhibition are among those who helped blaze a trail in a myriad of fields and industries, inspiring generations of scientists and engineers to follow in their footsteps and play their part in building the city we know today.'", "description": "The black and white photo was taken by 19th century engineer Washington Teasdale of himself sitting in front of Kirkstall Abbey, north-west of Leeds city centre, in 1883. It could be one of the first selfies.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20287860-0-image-a-61_1572281808987.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
