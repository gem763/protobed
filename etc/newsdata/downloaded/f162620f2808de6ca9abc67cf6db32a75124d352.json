Bakkt has already opened early access to the app.\n\nWhen it comes to merchants, the company is focused \"on delivering more control over costs and innovative customer engagement, both freeing up capital and supporting a direct relationship with their customers.\" Also, the CPO claims that for merchants, their infrastructure enables a \"new form of payment acceptance at a lower cost per transaction along with faster settlement times, driving efficiencies compared to existing workflows.\"\n\n\"Based on years of seeing how small shifts can lead to wholesale change in an industry, I have strong conviction that by driving more integration and efficiency across digital wallets, transaction processing and payment acceptance, there are meaningful opportunities for merchants and consumers to seamlessly interact using digital assets in ways that have not been previously considered. It is often said that digital assets will be successful when consumers don\u2019t have to think about the technology underlying them,\" Blandina said.\n\nAs reported, on Friday, Bakkt set a new daily record of 1,179 Bakkt Bitcoin Futures contracts traded, or 84% more than the previous record set earlier this week.\n\n\u2219 Today's volume so far: 302 BTC \u2219 Last traded price: $9,352.50 \u2014 Bakkt Volume Bot (@BakktBot)\n\nMoreover, last week, the company, launched by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, announced another major step as they're planning to launch the first regulated options contract for Bitcoin futures.\n\nBesides Starbucks, the partners and investors in Bakkt include companies such as Boston Consulting Group, CMT Digital, Eagle Seven, Galaxy Digital, Goldfinch Partners, Alan Howard, Horizons Ventures, Microsoft\u2019s venture capital arm, M12, Pantera Capital, PayU, the fintech arm of Naspers, and Protocol Ventures.\n\nReportedly, the digital asset trading platform raised USD 182.5 million last year during their first round, putting its post-money valuation at around USD 740 million, while ICE may have sold up to 25% of shares in Bakkt to external investors.", "description": "Bakkt, the recently launched Bitcoin futures trading platform, said they're now focused on the development of a consumer app and merchant portal, \"as well as testing with our first launch partner, Starbucks, which we expect in the first half of next year.\"", "authors": ["Linas Kmieliauskas"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5db/712360c6d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
