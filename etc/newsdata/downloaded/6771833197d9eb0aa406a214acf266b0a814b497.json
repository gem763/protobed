Decliners outnumbered advancers 1083 to 636.\n\nBP BP, -3.30% was the worst performer, shedding 3.6%. The oil giant reported earnings that topped analyst forecasts.\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, +0.1089% recovered from early losses to trade nearly flat on the day, at $1.2861.\n\nPolls have shown the ruling Conservative Party led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a sizeable lead over Labour.\n\n\u201cThe result needs to be decisive in favour of the pro-leave Conservative Party or the anti-no-deal rainbow of opposition parties. A narrow Tory victory, requiring support from elsewhere to form a workable government, could simply leave us in the same clogged political situation,\u201d said Oliver Blackbourn, multi-asset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.", "description": "The head of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said Tuesday that he now backs an election since the European Union has agreed to delay Brexit until...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT242_boris__ZG_20191014105124.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
