Party officials including Khalaf have had contacts with U.S. officials since it was founded in 2018, he said.\n\nAsked about the accusation that Turkey-backed groups had killed Khalaf, the spokesman for the Turkey-backed National Army, which groups Syrian rebel factions, said they had not made it as far as the highway known as the M4.\n\n\u201cI confirm to you that our forces have not reached the M4,\u201d Youssef Hammoud said in a voice message to Reuters, saying that they had instead reached a road closer to the border.\n\nAsked about the Observatory report that rebels had killed a total of nine civilians on the road, he gave the same answer.\n\nTurkey and its Syrian rebel allies launched an offensive into SDF-held parts of northeastern Syria on Wednesday.\n\nThe SDF, in a statement, said Khalaf\u2019s killing on the highway between Aleppo and Hasaka showed \u201cthe Turkish invasion does not differentiate between a soldier, a civilian or a politician\u201d. The SDF statement identified her as party co-chair.\n\nA map sent by an SDF official showed the location of the incident on the M4 highway southeast of Tel Abyad.\n\nThe SDF had earlier reported that a group of \u201cmercenaries of the Turkish army\u201d had killed a number of civilians on the road after infiltrating the area, without identifying them.\n\nSDF forces had then repelled the attackers and the road was reopened, it said.\n\nLed by an Arab from Manbij, Khalaf\u2019s party was launched in a ceremony in Raqqa, the city captured by the SDF from Islamic State in 2017. Omar said it has been involved in the autonomous administration for northern Syria.\n\nOmar said party officials including Khalaf, a civil engineer, had met U.S. officials on visits to the region. \u201cThe Americans have been in constant contact with this party up until now,\u201d he told Reuters by phone.", "description": "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces accused Turkey-backed fighters of killing a Kurdish politician in an ambush on a road in northern Syria on Saturday, drawing a denial from a Turkey-backed rebel force which said it had not advanced that far.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
