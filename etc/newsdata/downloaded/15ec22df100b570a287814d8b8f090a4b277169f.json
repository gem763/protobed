Human brain, but I rather skip the philosophical discussion leading nowhere and come to the ground reality.\n\nWhat would be the aftermath if, the 35 % of Indians who, as-claimed by \u201cexperts\u201d have a health issue worthy of meeting a professional and they decide to seek help?\n\nSo, if these 40 odd crore people wake up one fine day to \u201caccept\u201d their problem, as kind ladies and gentlemen spreading mental health \u201cawareness\u201d want them to, and start calling doctors or even \u201cmental health professionals\u201d, who are they and where are they?\n\nTo understand this better, we need to list the mental healthcare \u201cprofessionals\u201d, their scope and the handle they have to deal with mental problems.\n\nThe first line of curative practices is technically known as psychologist, but in India he/she can be anything from a tarot card reader to a rich lady who images that she has suffered and thus has wisdom to cure.\n\nIf that is not disastrous enough, our policy-makers have never really bothered to create a professional for this critical field and hence anyone with a BA in psychology degree earned by passing through a curriculum that still teaches things that world has discarded decades back can set the mood for the \u201cpatient\u201d by casually using words like depression and anxiety with phrases like \u201cbipolar\u201d or \u201cOCD\u201d thrown in for free.\n\nThe next in line are two \u201ctrue\u201d doctors, psychiatrist and neuro-physician (we will leave the surgeons aside in this discussion), who have earned their titles through years of education.\n\nThe psychiatrist is more of a man of chemical-locha while the physician knows more about the geography of brain. Both are qualified to prescribe medicines that can alter the very sense of existence and hence armed with the greatest power that one human can have over the other.\n\nAs we are one of the world leaders in having less than one psychiatrist, the first properly educated person in mental health care assembly line, the prospect of an average Indian to wade past the quagmire of self-appointed councillors and psychologists and meet a real doctor are almost non-existent.\n\nSo, anyone from the 40 crore passes through the sieve of curative process described above, his chances are that he will be meeting a completely unqualified random-word throwing person who is not regulated by law to plant a seed of fear in his mind about being \u201cill\u201d and then move up the assembly line to get his quota of medicines that even the manufacturers don\u2019t completely know how they work.\n\nI am not sure how much better this is than someone actually having a mental healthcare issue and not being aware.\n\nBut, as we insist on importing one more cause from the cultures who are actually the cause (as we did in case of climate change) for our educated ladies and kind gentlemen to feel occupied with, I would now like to point out what happens when people become \u201caware\u201d of mental health issues and actually seek help.\n\nOur dreamland, the heaven of earth for Indians, the mighty US of A is obviously a place to go looking is we want to learn anything, so I invite the readers to look at some statistics from the paradise (at least for the pharma companies making psycho-active medicines).\n\nAs USA is obviously a very aware culture, almost 13 % Americans would have eaten an antidepressant prescription drug in last month and as the awareness is spreading fast thanks to the campaigns, increase in people using antidepressants between 1999 and 2014 is a whopping 64 %.\n\nAs they are popping antidepressants by the tons every month, there is another clear gain that they are making, and that is in suicide numbers.\n\nThe annual U.S. suicide rate increased 24% between the same period (1999 and 2014), from 10.5 to 13.0 suicides per 100,000 people, the highest rate recorded in 28 years.\n\nI understand that, as we are desperate to rub shoulders with the developed nations (with most of them eating even more antidepressants than USA), we must to become \u201caware\u201d and bring the benefits of modern medicine to India, but, jokes apart, have we thought things through before waking up the sleeping monster of mental health problems?\n\nWe have a practically unregulated free-for-all first line of defence in terms of quack psychologists, non-existent number of actually qualified doctors, healthcare sector reduced to money-making and pharmacies that can sell an antidepressant to a teenager without even a prescription, we are really playing with fire.\n\nWe need to understand that, to start with, we know very little about what is mental health and what is actually a cure, and now we want to fall in the same trap of west telling us how to cure a problem that their culture has created but are unable to cure.", "description": "Cometh 10the October and every mass media space turns into the a dreamscape for a pharmaceutical company in the business of putting together a random mix of molecules and ambitiously calling them medicines knowing that...", "authors": ["Samir Shukla"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
