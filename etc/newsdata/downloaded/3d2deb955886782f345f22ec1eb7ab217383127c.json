Britain's PM Johnson speaks ahead of \"Super Saturday\" Brexit deal vote in London\n\nBy Andrew MacAskill and Kylie MacLellan\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces two pivotal votes in parliament on Tuesday that will decide if he can deliver on his promise to lead the United Kingdom out of the European Union in nine days time.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the latest Oct. 31 deadline for Britain's departure, Brexit is hanging in the balance as a divided parliament debates when, how and even whether it should happen.\n\nAfter he was forced by opponents into the humiliation of asking the EU for a delay that he had promised he would never seek, Johnson is battling to ram legislation through the House of Commons that will enact his last-minute Brexit deal.\n\nIn yet another day of high drama, lawmakers vote at around 1800 GMT on the 115-page Withdrawal Agreement Bill and then vote on the government's extremely tight timetable for approving the legislation.\n\n\"I hope parliament today votes to take back control for itself,\" said Johnson, the face of the successful 2016 referendum campaign to leave the EU.\n\n\"The public doesn't want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. Let's get Brexit done on 31 October and move on.\"\n\nDefeat in either vote would scupper Johnson's plans to leave the EU with or without a divorce deal on Oct. 31. He would have to decide whether to abide by a law that demands he accept any Brexit delay offered by the EU or somehow leave without a deal.\n\nVictory, while an imperfect indicator of possible support for Johnson's deal, would simply open up another opportunity for opponents to ambush the government in parliament with amendments that could wreck Johnson's plans by demanding a much closer post-Brexit relationship with the EU.\n\nThe pound was flat at $1.2943 in London trading. Foreign exchange markets now price in Britain either leaving with a deal or delaying Brexit, or possibly both.\n\nBREXIT IN PLAY\n\nMore than three years since the United Kingdom voted 52-48 to leave the European Union, the Brexit crisis is straining the British political and constitution system to breaking point.\n\nJohnson confounded his opponents by winning a Brexit deal from the EU on Thursday, though he was forced by his opponents to reluctantly - and with a mere unsigned photocopy - ask for a Brexit delay on Saturday. House of Commons speaker John Bercow refused a vote on his deal on Monday.\n\nIf Johnson is defeated on Tuesday, much will depend on how the EU plays yet another Brexit quandary.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he was discussing the request for a Brexit delay with the leaders of the other 27 member states and would make a decision \"in the coming days\".\n\n\"A no-deal Brexit will never be our decision,\" Tusk told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, to applause from lawmakers.\n\nIn a sign of the frustration in Brussels, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Brexit was a waste of time and energy and that the European Parliament could only approve Johnson's deal after the British parliament.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage told the EU parliament that another delay was on the cards.\n\nBehind the daily Brexit combat in parliament, the courts and at late-night EU summits, a much bigger game is being played over whether Brexit will happen at all.\n\nBut while Johnson faces legislative booby traps at every juncture, the opponents of Brexit are also deeply divided - one of the main reasons their campaign to \"Remain\" failed in the 2016 referendum.\n\nStill, Johnson is asking a divided parliament where he has no majority to approve in just three days one of the most important pieces of legislation in recent British history.\n\nThe so called WAB (Withdrawal Agreement Bill) will have less time for debate in the House of Commons than a law to ban the use of wild animals in circuses, according to the Institute for Government.\n\nPrevious bills to implement major European treaties have taken between 10 and 40 days to get through parliament. Government ministers said parliament has enough time already to discuss every intricacy of Brexit.\n\n\"Labour opposes Johnson\u2019s sell-out deal and will seize every opportunity to safeguard workers\u2019 rights, protect our economy and ensure the people are given the final say,\" opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said.\n\nA spokesman for Johnson said that if the legislation strayed too far from the deal then its ratification would be placed in question.", "description": "Brexit in the balance as Johnson faces crunch votes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L0JN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
