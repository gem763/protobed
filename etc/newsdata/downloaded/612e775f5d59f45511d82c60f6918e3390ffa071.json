The sitcom \u201cFriends\u201d is moving to AT&T Inc. \u2019s WarnerMedia next year, while \u201cThe Office\u201d will head to NBCUniversal in 2021\u2014in both cases to be featured in streaming services the companies plan to launch.\n\nshare your thoughts How will the moves of these popular shows affect your streaming subscription decisions? Join the conversation below.\n\nTerms of the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d deal, which was first reported by the Los Angeles Times, weren\u2019t disclosed. In 2015, Hulu reached an agreement with \u201cSeinfeld\u201d distributor Sony Pictures Television, a unit of Sony Corp., for U.S. rights to the show for six years valued at $130 million, a person close to the matter said.\n\nThe price tag for Netflix\u2019s acquisition of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d is likely higher, people familiar with the matter said, because it includes international rights.\n\nNetflix has a big lead in the streaming-video wars, with some 150 million global subscribers. But it faces some challenges as new entrants arrive in the industry, some with lower-priced services. In its most recent quarter, the company lost U.S. subscribers for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nNetflix has invested heavily in original programming, but its viewers spend a large portion of their time watching classic hits in its library, according to Nielsen data. The price for popular old shows is on the rise as new streaming services Disney, WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp ,\u2019s NBCUniversal are all launching in the next several months.\n\nNBCUniversal recently agreed to a five-year deal for \u201cThe Office\u201d valued at $500 million while WarnerMedia landed streaming rights to \u201cFriends\u201d for five years at $425 million. The \u201cSeinfeld\u201d deal exceeds either of those pacts, a person with knowledge of the matter said, showing that Netflix is willing to pay a hefty price for certain properties.\n\nReruns of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d will still be available on local TV stations and the WarnerMedia cable channel TBS. The show has already made more than $3 billion in global rerun deals, an executive close to the show said.\n\nBesides Sony and \u201cSeinfeld\u201d creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, other beneficiaries of the new deal include WarnerMedia, which became a financial stakeholder in the program when it acquired Castle Rock, the company that produced \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\n\nRelated Video Disney, AT&T and Comcast have plans to enter the streaming-video ring, armed with well-known TV and movie brands. But can they hold their own against industry juggernaut Netflix?
