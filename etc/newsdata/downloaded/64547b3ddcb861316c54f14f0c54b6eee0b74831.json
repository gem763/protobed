He played a key role in organizing \u201chate camp\u201d trainings for the group's members at an abandoned building known as \u201cDevil's Tower\u201d in Skagit, Washington, and in Nevada's Death Valley. Cole also helped craft the group\u2019s eye-catching propaganda.\n\nAtomwaffen Division is an underground neo-Nazi guerrilla organization which had 23 chapters throughout the United States as of mid-2018. Since its inception in 2015, Atomwaffen members have been implicated in five homicides and several bomb plots, and are the subject of an intensifying national investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It makes common cause with other militant fascist groups like the Base and Sonnenkrieg Division in the United Kingdom, where authorities have charged a number of members with terrorism-related offenses.\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported, the Seattle Police Department obtained an \u201cExtreme Risk Protection Order\u201d against Cole on September 26 to confiscate his concealed carry firearms permit and any firearms he owned for at least a year. That same day, SPD seized five rifles, a shotgun, three semiautomatic handguns and four lower receivers (the firing mechanism of a rifle that can be used to craft untraceable \u2018ghost guns\u2019) from Cole's father's house outside Arlington, in Washington State's Snohomish County.\n\nAccording to court records, none of the guns or the lower receivers seized from Cole were registered in Washington State's licensed firearms database.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about the respondent's access to firearms and his involvement in the Atomwaffen Division, a known terrorist group,\u201d Seattle Police Sergeant Dorothy Kim wrote in a petition for an Extreme Risk Protection Order.\n\nAs further evidence, Sgt. Kim cited Atomwaffen Division propaganda calling for \u201cRace War Now,\u201d and the group's adherence to \u201cacceleration theory,\u201d which urges actions that undermine the existing social order to \u201cexacerbate the feeling of alienation among white supremacists and a greater impulse to engage in violence or destructive behavior.\u201d\n\nCole's \u201cwords, actions and behavior suggest he has taken additional steps towards a plan with his ideologically motivated violence. Specifically, the coordinated camps with firearms training, overseas travel with Atomwaffen paraphernalia-flags/skull masks, threats to kill (gas the Kikes) and the possession of firearms, suggest an imminent risk to public safety if Cole is permitted to continue to purchase or possess firearms,\u201d Sergeant Kim wrote.\n\nThe request to seize Cole's guns was reportedly made to Seattle Police by the FBI, which did not have enough information to file criminal charges but believed Cole posed a serious threat to public safety.\n\nMultiple law enforcement sources told The Daily Beast that Cole had been the target of an FBI investigation following his February 2018 identification by ProPublica. However, law enforcement made no contact with him until December 28, 2018, when Cole landed in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on a flight from London. Customs and Border Protection pulled Cole aside for secondary screening. Records of that interview were included by the Seattle Police Department in their emergency risk petition last month.\n\nDuring the interview, Cole told CBP agents he had traveled to the Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine with two friends from Washington State, Aidan Bruce-Umbaugh and Edie Allison Moore. The trip, Cole said, was to \u201csee the historic architecture and museums in Eastern European countries.\u201d The three also attended a heavy metal festival while in Kyiv. The 2018 edition of Asgardsrei, a festival several National Socialist black metal bands have played in the past, was held in Kyiv from December 15-16 last year. Photographs from the concert posted to social media show an Atomwaffen Division flag brandished by individuals in the crowd.\n\nAccording to information obtained by The Daily Beast, Aidan Bruce-Umbaugh is a member of the Washington State cell of Atomwaffen Division, and goes by the moniker \u201cNythra.\u201d The drummer for Kaleb Cole's old metal band, Operblut, is listed as \u201cNythra\u201d on music websites. In the CBP interview, Cole told federal agents he and Bruce-Umbaugh had been friends since grade school.\n\nBorder agents searched Cole's luggage, and found a skull mask balaclava and an Atomwaffen Division flag inside his bag. When questioned about press reports tying him to Atomwaffen Division, Cole admitted to his involvement with the group and stated that he \u201cshares a Fascist ideology, 'strong dominate the weak'.\u201d He also admitted he owned an AK-47 and multiple handguns \u201cfor his own protection.\u201d\n\nCole's phone was also searched by border agents, who downloaded several images from the device. Amongst them are a photograph of Cole and another man wearing skull mask balaclavas in front of the gates of Auschwitz, the death camp where the Nazis murdered hundreds of thousands of Jews. Images of him posing with other Atomwaffen members, firearms, and the group's flag were also recovered from Cole's phone.\n\nAccording to multiple sources close to law enforcement, Cole previously attracted the interest of Canadian authorities by frequently driving across the border to British Columbia, sometimes several times a week. In late May, Cole was detained by the Canadian Border Service Agency because of press reports linking him to Atomwaffen Division, as well as \u201chis overseas travel to Ukraine,\u201d where several right-wing extremists have traveled to fight with the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion against Russia-backed separatists.\n\nAccording to court records, he was held by Canadian authorities and placed into deportation proceedings due to his involvement in \u201can organization that may engage in terrorism,\u201d per Section 34 [1][F] of the Canadian Immigration Code. According to records prepared by the Seattle Police Department, Cole was deported in July and \u201cbarred from Canada for life.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police both declined to comment on Cole's deportation, the Atomwaffen Division or its affiliated organizations in Canada, citing the restrictions of Canada\u2019s Privacy Act.\n\nEarlier this year, Patrik Mathews, a master corporal in the Canadian Military Reserve went AWOL after being identified as a recruiter for the Base. Mathews\u2014who reportedly came to the attention of multiple Canadian security agencies because racist material was previously found by the Canadian Border Services Agency in his car while crossing the border with the United States\u2014is still at large.", "description": "Seattle police seized a slew of firearms, records show, while Canadian authorities found he was involved with \u201can organization that may engage in terrorism.\u201d", "authors": ["Ali Winston"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571450185/191018-Winston-neonazi-tease_pwtdum", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
