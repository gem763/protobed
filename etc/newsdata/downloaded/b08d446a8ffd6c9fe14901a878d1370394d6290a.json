Subject not pictured. source Maskot/Getty Images\n\nSome people will do anything to escape the rat race.\n\nJust ask 36-year-old Daniel, a Manhattan corporate lawyer earning $270,000 a year, who told Suzy Weiss of The New York Post that he lives in New Jersey to avoid city taxes, lives on rice and beans, owns one patched-together suit per weekday for work, and layers up during the winter instead of turning the heat on \u2013 all so he can save 70% of his salary and retire early.\n\nIt\u2019s working: He\u2019s saved more than $400,000 and is set to retire in three years, Weiss wrote.\n\nOther six-figure earners Weiss talked to have similar goals and are pulling out all the stops to reach them, from banning buying drinks out to wearing shoes that are falling apart.\n\nThey all hope to join the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement, which was first popularized when \u201cYour Money or Your Life\u201d was published 20 years ago. It\u2019s nothing new \u2013 but more millennials are becoming interested in the community, according to Weiss.\n\nRead more: What 8 people wish they knew before retiring in their 20s and 30s\n\nLiving on less helps early retirees stay on track\n\nBeing content with less and refusing to succumb to lifestyle inflation are the tickets to staying on track to retire early.\n\nJ.P. Livingston, who runs a personal finance blog called The Money Habit, built a nest egg of more than $2 million before retiring at 28. Livingston worked in Manhattan\u2019s finance industry and earned $100,000 in her first post-grad job, she previously told Business Insider.\n\nBut, determined to retire early, she tucked 70% of her take-home pay away. In an effort to be more frugal, she bought furniture from Craigslist and chose a living situation more modest than one she could have afforded \u2013 with a roommate in a three-floor walk-up on the Upper East Side for $1,050 a month (reasonable rent in a New Yorker\u2019s eyes).\n\nEven those not working in traditional high-salaried careers make do with a frugal lifestyle. Consider Joe and Ali Olson, who quit their jobs as public school teachers in their early 30s with $1 million in the bank. They saved 75% of their income and lived in a 400-square-foot home, keeping their annual expenses to about $20,000, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRead more: A day in the life of a 34-year-old early retiree who lives in NYC, grew his net worth to $1.25 million in just 5 years, and wakes up at 7:30 a.m.\n\nFrugality is the key to building wealth\n\nRegardless of early retirement goals, frugality is the key to building wealth.\n\nLook no further than Warren Buffett, who still lives in the modest home in Omaha, Nebraska, that he bought for $276,700 (in today\u2019s dollars), or Richard Branson, who is famously frugal when it comes to buying luxury items.\n\nFrugal lifestyles help millionaires get rich in the first place, according to Sarah Stanley Fallaw, the director of research for the Affluent Market Institute and an author of \u201cThe Next Millionaire Next Door: Enduring Strategies for Building Wealth,\u201d in which she surveyed more than 600 millionaires in America.\n\nDuring her research, she studied the characteristics most predictive of net worth and found that six behaviors, which she called \u201cwealth factors,\u201d were related to net-worth potential, regardless of age or income. One of those is frugality: a commitment to saving, spending less, and sticking to a budget.\n\n\u201cSpending above your means, spending instead of saving for retirement, spending in anticipation of becoming wealthy makes you a slave to the paycheck, even with a stellar level of income,\u201d she wrote.", "description": "Business Insider - An increasing number of millennials are trying to retire early.
