The event's organizers aimed to clear things up in a statement on its Facebook page.\n\nWJLA\n\n\"The Great Frederick Fair\u2019s number one priority is the safety and security of our guests,\" the statement said. \"To dispel rumors of the events of last night, while there was an assault, there was NO shooting and NO stabbing. The team of security and law enforcement was able to respond rapidly to control and contain the incident.\"\n\nThe 15-year-old suspect has been charged with first-degree assault, second-degree assault and reckless endangerment. The 16-year-old was charged with second-degree assault. However, the sheriff\u2019s office said it was consulting with state prosecutors to determine additional charges in light of the victim's subsequent death.\n\nInvestigators said they interviewed both suspects, but the office did not release any details about a possible motive.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told Washington ABC affiliate WJLA that the suspects may have been playing the so-called \"knockout game\" -- in which the attacker aims to knock out the victim with a single sucker punch -- but a spokesperson for the sheriff's office would not confirm those suspicions.\n\nThe violent game has been linked to assault reports in at least six states, and several people have been killed in suspected knockout attacks.\n\nThe teens were being held in juvenile custody pending an initial court hearing. It's unclear if they have retained attorneys.\n\nABC News' Amanda Maile contributed to this report.", "description": "They were accused of fatally punching a man in what investigators are calling a random and unprovoked attack.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/fair-knockout-death-wjla-mo-20190922_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
