Later, he will speak at the largest annual gathering of law enforcement leaders in the world, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson, this year's conference host, said he plans to boycott the president's remarks, a move that pushed Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police board to issue a vote of no confidence in Johnson.\n\n\"As police officers, our job is to be the voice for the voiceless and ambassadors to the communities that we serve,\" Johnson said in response to the vote. \"I can't in good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the oval office or Chicago is held hostage because of our views on new Americans.\"\n\nChciago teachers strike: When will it be over?\n\nIn this March 26, 2019, file photo, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson speaks during a news conference in Chicago.

In a January 2017 interview with ABC, Trump compared Chicago to Afghanistan, saying, \"Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago.\" Trump said he would \"send in the feds\" to fix the city's \"horrible carnage.\"\n\n\"People are being shot left and right, thousands of people over a short period of time,\" Trump said, adding, \"Chicago is like a war zone.\"\n\nPres. Trump says he wants Chicago to fix violence problem: \"Afghanistan is not like what\u2019s happening in Chicago.\" https://t.co/44NFiXe2aopic.twitter.com/C1IdeWQTDp \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) January 26, 2017\n\nHow Chicago has responded to Trump\n\nChicago hasn't taken too kindly to Trump's comments.\n\nDuring a campaign visit in March 2016, Trump was essentially booted out of the city: Protests at a rally at the University of Illinois Chicago prompted organizers to cancel the event half an hour before it was scheduled to begin.\n\nAnti-Donald Trump protesters and his supporters confront during a Trump rally at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago on March 11, 2016.

The city later sued the Justice Department over a plan to withhold federal public safety grants from sanctuary cities.\n\nChicago's new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, has similarly defended her city against criticism from the president and his supporters. In August, when Ivanka Trump tweeted about a weekend of shootings in Chicago, Lightfoot fired back, saying Ivanka Trump had misrepresented the events and had not reached out to city officials.\n\nGiven Trump's rocky history with Chicago, it's likely that Johnson won't be the only one protesting the president's visit. The Rev. Marshall Hatch, a pastor at Mt. Pilgrim Missionary Baptist on the city's West Side, gave Johnson a round of applause at a meeting of faith leaders Wednesday.\n\n\"It is a chance to send a statement from Chicago. This is the one place the president has almost been fearful to come,\" Hatch said. \"There\u2019s a very active, progressive element in this city. I suspect he\u2019s going to get the kind of greeting here that he doesn\u2019t get in other cities.\"\n\nTrump's speech could worsen the tense relationship between police and communities, said Ciera Walker-Chamberlin, a minister in the Jesus Christ House of Prayer Church and executive director of Live Free Chicago, which works on mass incarceration and violence prevention.\n\n\"Here in Chicago, we have worked very hard to rebuild trust between police and the community and the last thing we need is for the president to undermine that with a tough-on-crime speech to police chiefs. If he really wants to help, he should fund violence prevention programs and support criminal justice reforms,\" she said.\n\nA demonstrator waits for the start of a rally with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at the University of Illinois at Chicago on March 11, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois.

Pfleger, a pastor at St. Sabina Church and an anti-gun violence activist, said he wrote a letter to the president encouraging him to visit with Chicagoans living on the South and West sides.\n\n\"Mr. Trump has continually tweeted and spoken in sound bites about Chicago,\" Pfleger said. \"Since he is coming, take time to listen and learn, to see how he can help. If he is only coming to pick up money, he should stay home.\"\n\nNearly 3,000 people have expressed interest in a Facebook event for a protest of Trump's visit. The event, called \"Get Out of Our House!,\" is being organized by groups including Indivisible Chicago and the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n\"The last time Trump tried to come to Chicago at UIC Pavilion, the Chicago community showed up, forcing Trump to cancel and leave town. We need to do that again, but it's going to take all of us,\" organizers wrote in the event description.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Chicago teachers and school staff would join the protest Monday, which would mark their eighth day of strike.\n\nChicago schools strike: It's for aides living off less than $36,000 a year, union says\n\nIs Trump right about gun violence in Chicago?\n\nTrump often holds up Chicago as a supposed example of how tougher gun laws don't prevent shootings.\n\n\"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city,\" Trump said in a 2016 presidential debate \u2014 a claim that he has since repeated.\n\nThat's not exactly true.\n\nIn recent years, Chicago has indeed reported the nation's most homicides.\n\nBut Chicago is also the nation's third-largest city. Homicide rates in Chicago pale in comparison to those of other cities when taking into account its population of more than 2.7 million people.\n\nEven considering firearm-relatedhomicide rates, specifically, Chicago is not a stand-out.\n\n\"When people say that Chicago is the 'homicide capital of the United States,' they\u2019re referring to the homicide count,\u201d said Jens Ludwig, director of the University of Chicago\u2019s Crime Lab, which partners with the Chicago Police Department. \"Chicago's actually got a middle-of-the-pack homicide rate, per capita.\"\n\nCrime rates in Chicago have generally tracked with trends in other major U.S. cities. But that pattern broke in 2016, when Chicago witnessed a unique surge of gun violence and captured the nation's attention.\n\n\"Chicago had a remarkable spike in homicides, for unclear reasons, in 2016. But since then, it\u2019s recovered by a large percent,\" said Phil Cook, a professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy. \"It looked to all the world like an epidemic outbreak in relatively few neighborhoods.\"\n\nA disproportionate amount of that violence occurred in a handful of neighborhoods on the city's South and West sides. These predominantly African American neighborhoods suffer from high levels of poverty, few job opportunities and often lack basic amenities like grocery stores.\n\nBut even at its peak in 2016, Chicago's homicide rate remained lower than that of smaller cities like Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans and St. Louis. Chicago's homicide rate also remained below its own recent peak at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1990s.\n\nLast year, Chicago again had the nation's highest number of firearm-related homicides.\n\nBut the city's firearm-related homicide rate, per capita, trailed St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, Memphis, Kansas City, Newark and Philadelphia, according to FBI data. In 2018, St. Louis reported a firearm-related homicide rate three times that of Chicago.\n\nFor the past two years, shootings and homicides have been declining in Chicago, and 2019 is on track to continue the trend.\n\nSeveral factors could be contributing to the decline, including an expected leveling-off following the surge of violence in 2016, Ludwig said.\n\n\"We\u2019ve generated some evidence that at least part of the cause is management changes at the Chicago Police Department. But there have been a bunch of other activities underway to reduce gun violence in the city,\" Ludwig said.\n\nWhat about Chicago's 'toughest guns laws' in the nation?\n\nExperts say that while Chicago is among the states with stricter gun laws, it's not the most restrictive.\n\nIllinois ranks eighth in the U.S. for strongest gun laws, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The organization says Illinois \u2014 which became the final state to allow concealed carry in 2013 \u2014 hasn't gone as far as other states on regulating gun dealers, limiting bulk firearm purchases and restricting large-capacity magazines. Its penalties for violating gun laws also aren't as strong as those of other states.\n\nA 2017 report by the City of Chicago found that stronger state and federal gun laws would help reduce gun violence in Chicago, as a majority of illegally used or possessed firearms recovered in the city could be traced back to states with less regulation over firearms, such as Indiana and Mississippi. Subsequent research has substantiated these findings.\n\n\"Cities and states can\u2019t unilaterally regulate the gun problem because guns flow so easily across city and state lines. It\u2019s really going to require federal regulation,\" Ludwig said.\n\nAlexandra Filindra, a political science professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, is critical of Trump's characterization of gun laws in the city.\n\n\"It is incredibly naive and simplistic to say that because we have high violence in one area, that means that gun laws are not effective,\" Filindra said. \"Trump has used Chicago as a dog-whistle in the past, and I think that his visit to Chicago will be interpreted in the same way.\"\n\nFollow Grace Hauck on Twitter @grace_hauck.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/28/trump-chicago-presidential-visit-highlights-gun-crime-violence/4072445002/", "description": "Donald Trump will make his first presidential visit to Chicago on Oct. 28, a city he often ridicules\u00a0for how its leaders handle\u00a0gun violence.", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Published A.M.
