The 25-year-old Marte was leading the NL with 187 hits when he was shut down, batting .329 with 32 homers and 92 RBIs.\n\nMarte was out of the lineup Wednesday at home against Miami. He had a precautionary MRI after leaving Tuesday\u2019s game in the fifth inning with back stiffness.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t measure my level of disappointment because he was such an important player to this team, this organization,\u201d manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cThat\u2019s obvious. But what I\u2019ll focus on is what he meant to this team, the development that he showed over the course of this year. That\u2019s all I can look at right now. He was a special player, he was a special man, and it\u2019s a special story. We\u2019re going to remember the year he had because of what he went out there and accomplished.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All-Star hitter Ketel Marte has a stress reaction in his back and won't play for the Arizona Diamondbacks again this season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/marlins_diamondbacks_baseball_10070_c0-177-4234-2645_s1770x1032.jpg?287ae1f76791c2844a510c4970c83a6b7a4571a2", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
