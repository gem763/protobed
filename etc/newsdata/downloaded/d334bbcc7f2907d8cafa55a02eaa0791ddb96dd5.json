Is It A Motorcycle? Kymco's New Electric Maxi-Scooter Has The Internet Divided", "language": "en", "text": "EICMA Milan Motorcycle Show is set to kick off and global auto makers have already started lining up their offerings for the event. An interesting line-up was announced by Taiwanese major Kymco recently - a new electric two-wheeler called the RevoNex. Interesting, because it isn\u2019t your regular e-scooter or motorcycle offering. This one tends to take cues from both.\n\nFor those reasons, you would preferably call the RevoNex an electric two-wheeler instead of a scooter or a motorcycle. That is, of course, if you are aloof to the term \u2018maxi-scooter\u2019, because that is exactly how the firm describes its new product.\n\nMaxi scooters employ automatic transmission and can generally taken to be the performance versions of regular scooters. They are designed to reach higher speeds and hence carry a larger engine than regular scooters. A corresponding increase can be seen in the wheel size, standover height and the overall built of the scooter too.\n\nTo give out a glimpse of the same, the company has featured a rear view of the RevoNex but that\u2019s it in terms of the information available around the RevoNex.\n\nKymco RevoNex\n\nDifferent from the rest\n\nIf Kymco had not mentioned the \u2018maxi-scooter\u2019 make for the RevoNex with the teaser image, it is easy to mistake it for a motorcycle. In fact, the image looks much like the rear profile of Yamaha\u2019s FZ or the Bajaj\u2019s Pulsar 200 NS sold in India. Now maxi-scooters always thrived on the thin line between scooters and motorcycles but to have it look so similar to the latter takes away the \u2018scooter\u2019 essence of the vehicle altogether. Though that is yet to be seen, only after its unveiling at the Milan show.\n\nDon't Miss 259 SHARES 260 SHARES\n\nApart from the design, RevoNex is another first for Kymco - an \u2018electric\u2019 maxi-scooter. The company has had a past with electric two-wheelers, launching a host of them over the past couple of years. None of them though, belong to this category. In fact, electric maxi-scooters are so uncommon that apart from a handful, none of the other major firms have bothered to come up with one yet, as per a report by Electrek.\n\nThat certainly gives Kymco the edge in the electric maxi-scooter segment, provided the RevoNex appeals to the market. That, however, will only be important once the product actually hits the roads. Kymco is notoriously famous for unveiling new products and then not following on their production. So will the RevoNex hold any significance in the global markets, only time will tell. Till then, we can at least wonder at the bold design that Kymco has gone for with the RevoNex.\n\nKymco also marked its India entry recently by collaborating with 22 Motors for its iFlow electric scooter that works on a swappable battery technology.
