REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde/File Photo\n\nNearly 300 had been held captive at a school in the Daura area of Katsina, the hometown of President Muhammadu Buhari, where police said they discovered \u201cinhuman and degrading treatment\u201d following a raid on Monday to free the remaining students.\n\nLate last month, police freed hundreds from similarly degrading conditions in neighbouring Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed the police to disband all such centres and all the inmates be handed over to their parents,\u201d said a presidential spokesman.\n\n\u201cThe government cannot allow centres where people, male and female, are maltreated in the name of religion,\u201d he said.\n\nPrior to this week\u2019s raid, hundreds of captives had escaped the centre, police said on Tuesday.\n\nThe 67 inmates who were freed by Katsina police were shackled, and many were taken to hospital for treatment, police superintendent Isah Gambo told Reuters.\n\n\u201cI tell you they were in very bad condition when we met them,\u201d Gambo said.\n\nA freed captive told Reuters on Monday that the instructors beat, raped and even killed some of the men and boys held at the facility, who ranged from 7 to 40 years of age. It was not immediately possible to verify his account.\n\nWhile the institution told parents it was an Islamic teaching centre that would help straighten out wayward family members, the instructors instead brutally abused them and took away any food or money sent by relatives.\n\n\u201cI deeply regret taking my child to the rehabilitation centre because I was ignorant of what was actually going on here,\u201d Alhaji Lawal Garka, a parent of one of the captives, told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nPolice said they had arrested the owner of the facility and two teachers, and were tracking other suspects.\n\nLocal resident Umar Galadima said that escaped captives were \u201crunning for their lives,\u201d with some throwing stones or brandishing weapons to fend off workers who tried to take them back to the facility.\n\nThe more than 200 captives who escaped were still missing, Gambo said. Police were working to reunite the others with family members.\n\n\u201cThe inmates are actually from different parts of the country - Kano, Taraba, Adamawa and Plateau States,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are not even Nigerians. They come from Niger, Chad and even Burkina Faso and other countries.\u201d\n\nIslamic schools, called Almajiris, are common in the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. Muslim Rights Concern, a local organisation, estimates about 10 million children attend them.\n\nBuhari said the government planned to ban the schools eventually, but he has not yet commented on the Katsina school.", "description": "Nigeria's president on Tuesday ordered a crackdown on abuse at Islamic schools, after a second police raid in less than a month revealed men and boys subjected to beatings, abuse and squalid conditions.", "authors": ["Desmond Mgboh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441088241&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0YH", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
