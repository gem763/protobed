It features quizzes about China's history, politics and more, as well as news articles about the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSTUDYING \u2018STUDY THE GREAT NATION\u2019: A new audit out today analyzing the \u201cStudy the Great Nation\u201d app, or Xuexi Qiangguo (\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u56fd) finds that the app has several concerning privacy-invasive capabilities and features, including \"superuser privileges.\" https://t.co/FPfeaVWyWL \u2014 Open Technology Fund (@OpenTechFund) October 12, 2019\n\nAn audit of the Android version of the app, conducted by the Open Technology Fund (OTF) and the Berlin-based cybersecurity firm Cure53, found that the app could potentially be used to access personal data from the user.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n\"It\u2019s spying on users in the sense that it's collecting a lot of information on users that it wouldn\u2019t normally need,\" Sarah Aoun, the director of technology at the OTF, told ABC News. \"There is no good reason that this app should be collecting all this information and sending it back to the servers.\"\n\nIn a statement announcing the findings of the audit, the OTF said the app \"contains code that amounts to a backdoor to rooted devices, essentially granting complete administrator-level access to a user\u2019s phone.\"\n\nThe OTF, which is an organization partially funded by the U.S. government that works to support internet privacy, security and more, said there is \"no evidence of if or how exactly this access is being used could be identified.\"\n\nMoreover, the audit found that the app \"actively scans to find other apps that are running on the user\u2019s device.\"\n\nThe OTF also alleges that the app \"purposely\" uses a \"weak cryptographic algorithm in areas containing sensitive user data.\"\n\nAoun says this is especially interesting because \"at the same time the app uses very strong anti-reversing techniques, it makes it very hard for someone to look into the code.\"\n\nIt also \"collects and sends detailed app log reports on a daily basis, containing a wealth of user data and app activity,\" according to the OTF statement.\n\nThe lengthy Cure53 report concludes that \"the application's functionality leads Cure53 to believe that violations of human rights are indeed taking place.\"\n\nAoun said the app essentially amounts to a \"surveillance device in your pocket.\"\n\n\"The biggest concern is just how many people actually have this app. We\u2019re talking about hundreds of millions of downloads,\" Aoun told ABC News. \"The most concerning part is just the reach and the size of this surveillance device in your pocket.\"\n\nChina's State Council Information Office denied the app had the functions the report alleged to the Washington Post, which first reported the story, telling the outlet in a faxed statement: \u201cWe learned from those who run the Study the Great Nation app that there is no such thing as you have mentioned.\"", "description": "The popular Chinese app", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/china-gty-er-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
