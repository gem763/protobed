In private, however, the president often strikes a different, more nuanced tone\u2014one driven by a concern that socialism (at least as defined by the Democrats) may actually sell politically.\n\nThis year, Trump has repeatedly told friends and donors that running against \u201csocialism\u201d in a general election may not be \u201cso easy\u201d because of its populist draw, according to four Republicans and sources close to Trump who\u2019ve heard him say this over the past several months.\n\nAccording to a person who was in the room, Trump told donors at a recent private event that though \u201ca lot of people think it\u2019ll be easy to beat [in 2020],\u201d the \u201ctruth is, it might not be so easy.\u201d The president, according to the source, said that \u201cyou can have someone who loves Trump, but many people love free stuff, too.\u201d He added that if candidates tell Americans, especially young voters\u2014that they\u2019re going to cancel their debt, \u201cthat\u2019s a tough one\u201d to run against.\n\nBernie Sanders Defines Democratic Socialism as Key to Defeating Trump\n\n\u201cI have discussed the popularity of the democratic socialists\u2019 message, i.e. Sanders and [Elizabeth] Warren, with President Trump on more than one occasion and in person,\u201d said Eric Bolling, a BlazeTV host and friend of the Trump family. \u201cSpecifically the idea of excusing debt and giving away, [as Trump says], \u2018free stuff\u2019 becoming more and more popular among younger voters.\u201d\n\nBolling said Trump had made these comments to him as recently as mid-2019. \u201cI feel it was more an observation than a re-election concern [of the president\u2019s],\u201d he recalled. \u201cI feel the discussion was more of a tamping-down of expectations than any serious concern about winning re-election in 2020. It\u2019s politics. Just look to Joe Biden who recently suggested Iowa isn\u2019t a must win state.\u201d\n\nPhoto Illustration by Kelly Caminero/Getty More\n\nTrump\u2019s private concessions don\u2019t reflect the message he and his party organs have typically pushed in public. Over the last year, the president, his campaign, the Republican National Committee, and a host of other prominent GOP campaign groups have sought to paint much, if not all, of the Democratic field as \u201csocialist.\u201d It\u2019s a playbook they\u2019ve used many times before, including against President Barack Obama. But it is widely believed to have more resonance now, with more progressive candidates\u2014including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the self-identifying democratic-socialist\u2014 running in the Democratic primary. The attack line is so central to the GOP playbook, that Trump even used it in his 2019 State of the Union address.\n\n\"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\" Trump said. \"America was founded on liberty and independence\u2014not government coercion, domination, and control\u2026Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d\n\nTeam Bernie on Trump: We Told You So\n\nThat Trump\u2019s private views about the political efficacy of socialism don\u2019t reflect his public utterances reflects, to some degree, his own unconventional approach to elected politics. The president ran in 2016 as a Republican, but with unorthodox views, having pledged repeatedly not to cut entitlement programs and to use the levers of the government to go after individual companies or industries that he deemed hostile to the U.S. economy or workforce.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/GettyAs he campaigns for reelection, Donald Trump and his team have made trashing the \u201csocialists or communists\u201d in the 2020 Democratic presidential field a cornerstone of their messaging.
