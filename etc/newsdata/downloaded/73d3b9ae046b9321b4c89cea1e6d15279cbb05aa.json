Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said that the American people stand with the \u201cfreedom-seekers in Hong Kong\u201d and Sen.

Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a close Trump ally, said \"it has been a ghoulish 70 years of Chinese Communist Party control.\u201d\n\nIn the House, GOP conference chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Rep.

Senate Republicans have voiced alarm at the violent protests in China. Over the summer, McConnell wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal warning Beijing would face consequences \u201cif Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy is eroded.\u201d\n\nBut while White House aides have encouraged the president to back the pro-democracy protesters, Trump has appeared reluctant to directly condemn Xi Jinping for the demonstrations \u2014 particularly as he tries to negotiate an end to a trade war that continues to spiral.\n\nLast week, during his speech before the United Nations, Trump went the furthest he\u2019s gone in criticizing China for its response to the protests, saying that his administration was \u201ccarefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong.\"\n\n\u201cThe world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations in which China commits to protect Hong Kong's freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cc/2a/34df3d1744f3a1bbcaa71b954501/20190827-trump-jinping-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
