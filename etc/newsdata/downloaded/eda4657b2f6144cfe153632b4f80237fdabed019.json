Or so it goes down in the new trailer for Netflix\u2019s The Politician, a Ryan Murphy\u2013Brad Falchuk\u2013Ian Brennan production starring Ben Platt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zoey Deutch, Jessica Lange, and Lucy Boynton. Ben Platt uses his Big Youth Pastor Energy for evil, doing whatever he can to become student-body president at his cutthroat Santa Barbara High School. But he\u2019s not the only one willing to exploit people, commit voter fraud, and throw political correctness out the window. Bette Midler and Judith Light aren\u2019t wearing power suits because they\u2019re weak, after all. September 27, try not to get pummeled on the way up.\n\nRelated", "description": "Ben Platt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Lange, and more star in Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u2018The Politician.\u2019 Watch the trailer.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/22/22-the-politican.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
