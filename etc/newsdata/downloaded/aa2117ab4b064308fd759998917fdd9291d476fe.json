Astronomers in Spain also leveraged the William Herschel Telescope in La Palma to get a glimpse.\n\nTogether, the telescopes revealed a fuzzy haze of dust surrounding the object, as well as a \"faint, broad tail\" of gas trailing behind it, according to a team of researchers in Poland who analyzed the observations. These are two \"canonical signatures\" of a comet, the researchers said.\n\nRead more: NASA says a new comet is likely an 'interstellar visitor' from another star system \u2014 the second ever detected\n\nThe findings were made available online in the repository ArXiv but have not yet been peer-reviewed. However, they serve as additional evidence that the comet does indeed have interstellar origins.\n\n\"Both orbital and morphological properties of this body show that this is the first certain case of an interstellar comet,\" the study authors wrote.\n\nScientists are trying to confirm that C/2019 Q4 comes from another star system\n\nThe Gemini North (foreground) and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope with the Milky Way arching overhead in Hawaii. Gemini Observatory/AURA/Joy Pollard\n\nGennady Borisov, an amateur astronomer in Crimea, first spotted C/2019 Q4 in the sky on August 30. Since then, astronomers worldwide have been trying to determine whether the comet has an orbit that's elliptical (oval-shaped and around the sun) or hyperbolic (checkmark-shaped and on an open-ended trajectory).\n\nIt seems much more likely that its path is hyperbolic, though more observations are required to know for sure. In particular, astronomers are trying to ascertain C/2019 Q4's eccentricity, or how extreme its orbit is.\n\n\"The error indicates it's still possible that's within the solar system,\" Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory, previously told Business Insider. \"But that error is decreasing as we get more and more data, and the eccentricity is looking interstellar.\"\n\nIf the measure of eccentricity is smaller than 1, Hainaut said, that indicates an object is from within our solar system. If it's larger, that suggests it's an interstellar object. The researchers behind the Gemini observations said their data showed an eccentricity of at least 3.\n\nThis object is different from 'Oumuamua\n\nAn artist's depiction of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua. ESA/Hubble; NASA; ESO; M. Kornmesser\n\nThe first interstellar object ever detected, the mysterious cigar-shaped 'Oumuamua, zoomed through our solar system in 2017.\n\n'Oumuamua did not exhibit the cometlike traits of C/2019 Q4. In fact, 'Oumuamua didn't look at all like the kind of interstellar object scientists had expected to see. That led some to argue that it may have been alien in origin, though that's highly unlikely.\n\nThis new comet seems to be more in-line with scientists' expectations about objects from other star systems.\n\n\"The discovery of this object indicates that interstellar comets might be common and creates a tremendous opportunity to study the first such object in detail,\" the study authors wrote.", "description": "C/2019 Q4 is likely the first comet ever detected that came from another star system.
