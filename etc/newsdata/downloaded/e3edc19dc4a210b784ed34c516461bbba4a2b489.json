Biden and his son Hunter may have been \u2014 say it with me \u2014 \u201cexonerated!\u201d for their activities in Ukraine, but Mr. Biden has not escaped damage. Indeed, the Ukraine imbroglio will likely prove fatal in a presidential race in which Mr. Biden was once firmly ensconced as the front-runner.\n\nSet aside the fact that the Bidens were \u201cexonerated!\u201d only by the notoriously corrupt government of Ukraine \u2014 a government that had every reason to curry favor with a potential next president of the United States. That was enough for The New York Times to declare any allegations against the former vice president and his son \u201cunfounded.\u201d\n\nBut even the plain, undisputed facts of the case undermine the two central arguments for Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n\nFirst, of course, is that Mr. Biden is uniquely attuned to the concerns of the middle class \u2014 so much so that, during his vice presidential tenure, the lifelong politician even adopted the moniker \u201cMiddle Class Joe.\u201d His nickname conveyed that Joe Biden is not just sympathetic to the middle class, but also a fully middle-class man himself. Much has been made of the fact, for instance, that Mr. Biden spent the first 10 years of his life in that epitome of all things virtuous and middle class, Scranton, Pennsylvania. (Less has been made of his later formative years, living in tax shelter Delaware, where his father worked as a successful car dealer.)\n\nFurthering his mythology as a regular Joe is that during his decades of work in Washington, Mr. Biden never actually set up a home here, but commuted each day via Amtrak back to Wilmington. (This, though, is an odd one, given that Amtrak\u2019s extortionate prices ensure that only the decidedly non-middle class could afford to use the system as a commuter rail.) Just last week, Mr. Biden tweeted that \u201cbeing middle class isn\u2019t a number. It\u2019s a value set,\u201d raising disturbing questions about what he thinks about the poor \u2014 but furthering his image as Middle Class Joe.\n\nRather less a part of the traditional middle-class \u201cvalue set\u201d is trading on your name and your father\u2019s position to secure a series of lucrative positions, as Hunter Biden indisputably did.\n\nThat the younger Mr. Biden, with zero energy business experience to his name, was given a $50,000-per-month directorship on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, while his father was serving as vice president and while war-ravaged Ukraine was desperately begging the United States for aid, is indisputable. So is the fact that Joe Biden did not object to such a squirrelly arrangement. The Ukraine arrangement blows a hole in the notion that the Bidens, father and son, are jes\u2019 middle-class folk.\n\nThe second central plank of Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential candidacy is that he is a man of great integrity, especially in contrast to the venal President Trump. Mr. Biden has promised repeatedly to restore the \u201cintegrity\u201d and \u201csoul\u201d of the country. But the revelation that the Bidens are just another sleazy, paid-up political family fatally undermines in this rationale for his candidacy as well.\n\nIt\u2019s telling, indeed, that Mr. Biden\u2019s defenders can\u2019t even muster a real defense for Hunter\u2019s excellent Ukrainian adventure and his father\u2019s complacency. Take Susan Hennessey, an omnipresent avatar of establishment liberalism \u2014 she has a sinecure at the Brookings Institution, a near-permanent role on CNN blabfests and a Twitter feed that never rests. But Ms. Hennessey could muster only a, \u201chey, everybody does it, and at least he disclosed it\u201d \u201cdefense.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll presidents and vice presidents and cabinet members have family and friends whose jobs might be impacted by policy. That\u2019s why we ask them to observe transparent ethics processes and norms. That is what Biden did,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nAfter several days of radio silence on the issue, Mr. Biden came out with an op-ed over the weekend in Washington\u2019s other newspaper declaring, \u201cTrump won\u2019t destroy me, and he won\u2019t destroy my family.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day \u2014 every few hours, seemingly \u2014 more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president,\u201d Mr. Biden wrote. \u201cHe is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me and my family, no doubt hoping to undermine my candidacy for the presidency.\u201d\n\nWords that did not appear in the former vice president\u2019s op-ed include \u201cUkraine,\u201d \u201cHunter\u201d and \u201cBurisma Holdings.\u201d\n\nAnd doesn\u2019t that say it all?\n\n\u2981 Ethan Epstein is deputy opinion editor of The Washington Times.
