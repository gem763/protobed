Or their parents\u2019. Or yours.\u201d\n\nThe infamous reconstructed transcript of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s telephone conversation with President Trump does evoke embarrassment. The Ukrainian enthusiastically demeans himself before Mr. Trump, calling him a \u201cgreat teacher,\u201d joining him in trashing European leaders, bad-mouthing the American ambassador Mr. Trump fired for all the wrong reasons and pledging to work on the investigations that Mr. Trump was seeking for his own political ends. He also notes that he stayed in one of Mr. Trump\u2019s hotels the last time he was in the United States.\n\nBut whether that performance was Mr. Zelensky revealing his real self or his Holoborodko character colliding with rude reality is a tough call. Ukraine, as Mr. Zelensky has noted, is fighting two wars \u2014 one against entrenched corruption fueled by a coterie of oligarchs, the other against rebel secessionists in eastern Ukraine propped up by Russia.", "description": "The young Ukrainian leader is jammed between the rock of Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression and the hard place of President Trump\u2019s demands.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/opinion/08zelensky/08zelensky-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
