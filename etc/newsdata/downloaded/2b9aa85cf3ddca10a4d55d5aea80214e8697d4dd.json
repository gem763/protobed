Trump has denied that there was any \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in his conversation with Zelensky.\n\nGiuliani has accused Hunter Biden of improper activity related to his business dealings with energy company Burisma Holdings, and claims that then-Vice President Joe Biden used his office to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma.\n\nThe former vice president has publicly acknowledged that he pressured the Ukraine to fire Shokin, but denied that it had any relation to his son\u2019s business dealings in the country and, Biden argued, was in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor.\n\nTRUMP FIRES BROADSIDE AT 'PILLAGING' BIDENS, CLAIMS UKRAINE PUSH WAS ONLY ABOUT 'CORRUPTION'\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn\u2019t do the job,\u201d Biden said on Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt.\n\nThe U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin\u2019s successor, have since said the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing.\n\nDirectly addressing the accusations being leveled against him, Biden\u2019s campaign last week wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News and CNN to voice \"grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSpeaking to the Biden campaign\u2019s request on Sunday, Giuliani continued his criticism of the news media and argued that even when he does appear on television, he is unable to answer a question without interruption. During his interview on \u201cMedia Buzz,\u201d Kurtz continually had to attempt to get Giuliani to answer his questions and stay on the topic being discussed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t let me get a sentence out,\u201d Giuliani told Kurtz. \u201c[The media] contradict me the minute I start speaking.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani lambasted the media on Sunday for what he says is its failure to investigate allegations of corruption leveled against former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/03/694940094001_6091765576001_6091768556001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
