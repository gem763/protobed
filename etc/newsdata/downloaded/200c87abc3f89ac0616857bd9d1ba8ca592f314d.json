Carpet is also pretty darn nice and cozy on your feet when you need to get up and go on a cold winter morning. Sound good? Here's what you need to know about the ins and outs of carpet installation.\n\nHow much does it cost to install carpet?\n\n\n\nBefore laying anything down, a carpet installer will need to make sure that the subfloor is in good shape. It needs to be stable, with no rot or nails sticking through it. If the floor is concrete, the installer will install a vapor barrier to prevent any moisture from seeping up.\n\nNext, a carpet pad is installed. Carpet pads have many functions\u2014they act as a shock absorber and make the surface more resilient and feel softer. Most pads should be between 1/4 and 7/16-inches thick (use a 3/8-inch pad if installing Berber) and accommodate 6 pounds per cubic foot density.\n\nIn light traffic areas (a guest bedroom for example), a urethane foam ($8 per square yard) is generally used. For high-traffic areas opt for flat rubber ($9 per square yard).\n\nOn average it costs around $18 per yard to install carpet, but keep in mind that many stores will often do the installation for free if you purchase your carpet and padding from them.\n\nWhere should I install carpet?\n\nBefore going on your carpet shopping spree, it's best to consider where exactly you plan to install it. Believe it or not, the location can affect which material will work best. In a kid's bedroom or playroom or other high-traffic area, you're going to need a carpet that can hold up to a lot of activity. For the master bedroom or den, you can go with something that's softer and feels good underfoot. If you have pets or plan on installing carpet in a mudroom or entry, think about a selection that's stain-resistant.\n\nWhat type of carpet is best?\n\n\n\nSynthetic carpets such as olefin, polyester, nylon, and Triexta are all good choices if you are worried about stains and want some long-term durability. Nylon and Triexta are both very durable and come in many patterns, colors, and pile heights. Olefin is stain- and fade-resistant but can abrade with use. Both acrylic and polyester are hardy (though acrylic could brown overtime), but the pile may become crushed with a lot of traffic. If you're worried about off-gassing, opt for a natural material such as wool, sisal, or jute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView photos Photo credit: Mukhina1 - Gallery Stock More\n\nWhich carpet style should I choose?\n\nOnce you've determined which material is going to best meet your needs, it's time to focus on the aesthetics. There are two main carpet types: looped pile and cut pile. All carpets start out as looped pile. To achieve a cut pile, the loops are simply cut open. From there, you can start looking at different kinds of styles.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to decorate a super groovy, 1970s-inspired den, you could go with a shag carpet that has very long tufts that are spaced far apart. If you want a plush look and feel, opt for \"Saxony.\" If you want a carpet that's clean and elegant, try \"Berber,\" which has a looped construction rather than a cut pile like Shag or Saxony. To add a splash of fun pattern, try a combination cut-and-loop carpet.\n\nLike everything in life, carpet comes in a wide range of prices. Typically sold by the square yard, here is a basic average for each type of material:\n\nOlefin: $9 per square yard\n\nNylon: $15 per square yard\n\nPolyester: $23 per square yard\n\nAcrylic: $36 per square yard\n\nTriexta: $36 per square yard\n\nWool: $90 per square yard\n\nPlease note, details and pattern will affect the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "We've got the skinny on what it's going to run to snag that wall-to-wall shag.", "authors": ["Charlyne Mattox"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K3xGewQbKDLw0D6S_pWAQw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_105/ba497d8bfd04f0a87fbf6c08e0182f1e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
