To date, no-one has been charged.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nKate Isaacs, from the #NotYourPorn campaign, said revenge porn was often labelled on Pornhub as \"amateur\" or \"home-made\" content - two popular search terms for videos that were making the site more valuable for advertisers.\n\nShe now wants the site to do more to delete such content as soon as they are made aware of it, and to prevent it from being reuploaded once taken down.\n\n'The effect on my family'\n\nBy the time Sophie discovered the videos of her online, she was in a new relationship - and it placed a strain on the couple.\n\nHer partner's friends made fun of him over her videos on Pornhub, she said.\n\nSophie also has a teenage daughter, who she said \"hasn't been the same since\".\n\nPornhub vice-president Corey Price said: \"Content that is uploaded to Pornhub that directly violates our terms of service is removed as soon as we are made aware of it and this includes non-consensual content.\n\n\"In 2015, to further ensure the safety of all our fans, we officially took a hard stance against revenge porn, which we believe is a form of sexual assault, and introduced a submission form for the easy removal of non-consensual content.\n\n\"We also use a state-of-the-art third-party digital fingerprinting software, which scans any new uploads for potential matches to unauthorised material and makes sure the original video doesn't go back up on the platform.\"\n\nFollow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.", "description": "One woman feels \"violated\", after a video uploaded by her ex-partner was viewed thousands of times.", "authors": ["James Melley", "Bbc Victoria Derbyshire Programme"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mkv8c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
