After all, incumbent president Donald Trump trails all of their leading candidates in nearly every poll. And now CNN reports that their purportedly most electable candidate has experienced a sudden \u2014 and perhaps inexplicable \u2014 renaissance in the polls:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president has rebounded, and now stands at its widest margin since April, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden has the support of 34% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, his best showing in CNN polling since just after his campaign\u2019s formal launch on April 25. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are about even for second, with 19% and 16%, respectively. Behind them, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris of California each have 6% support, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke each at 3%.\n\nCNN\u2019s poll is not the only evidence of a Biden bump, although whether it\u2019s meaningful is another question. Since August, Biden\u2019s RCP average has oscillated between 26-30%, and even with this CNN poll factored in, it\u2019s only at the top of that oscillation. The most recent results from Morning Consult (30%) and Survey USA (32%) put Biden over that oscillation curve, but again not by much, and no one knows for how long either.\n\nA better question might be what transpired to give Biden such a big jolt upward in the CNN series. Literally nothing comes to mind. He didn\u2019t have a good debate last week, although he didn\u2019t have a disaster either. Biden-mentum is almost a joke at this point, and his fundraising has become second-tier. The only good explanation is that Democratic anxiety over the prospect of a radical progressive takeover has refocused voters on Biden as the most marketable moderate:\n\nWhen the 2020 Democratic presidential contest kicked off earlier this year, the massive field was hailed as the most diverse in history, with candidates who spanned the ideological spectrum and offered enough in a broad buffet of options to excite any voter. But after 10 months of campaigning and 15 hours of nationally televised debates, another emotion is rising: anxiety. Party leaders and activists are citing weakness in all of the leading contenders, including former vice president Joe Biden, who has been forced on the defensive about his family\u2019s ethics, performed haltingly in debates and set off alarms with his poor fundraising. They also fret that the two other top-ranking candidates, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), are too liberal to win a general election. Other candidates have had moments to shine, but none yet have fully transformed that into anything approaching momentum. Oprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama who was initially enthusiastic about former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, has repeatedly begged Disney chief executive Bob Iger to jump into the race. Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction. \u2026 John Coale, a major donor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, was more blunt. \u201cThey don\u2019t have anybody who can win the general [election],\u201d he said.\n\nAgain, this is a strange claim to make when polling shows the opposite. RCP doesn\u2019t chart all of the results for all of the combinations, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find an argument against electability for any of the current crop of Democrats. Biden has only trailed Trump in one national poll all year \u2014 a Rasmussen poll. Warren has only trailed in a few, and none since July. Sanders has only trailed in two, although one was an Emerson poll last month. Even Buttigieg has more or less split the polling with Trump.\n\nOf course, Trump voters don\u2019t tend to trust the polls, and 2016\u2019s election more or less vindicated that point of view. Perhaps Democrats have lost faith in them too, which might be a big signal. For the moment, though, it\u2019s the only semi-objective evidence at hand.\n\nSo who\u2019s stirring up all this anxiety? Cui bono? The Hill pooh-poohs the idea that Hillary Clinton is working on a comeback, calling it a \u201cRepublican fantasy,\u201d but it\u2019s veeeerrrry interesting that all this \u201crising anxiety\u201d seems to be coming from the Democratic establishment. One has to wonder whether the dismissal of the entire field isn\u2019t just a machination to generate a late draft-Hillary movement. That in itself might explain any lasting Biden bump that could be emerging.", "description": "Is a draft-Hillary whisper campaign just a GOP fantasy?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hillary-point.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
