Ankara says it aims to create a security zone deep inside Syria.\n\nOn March 18, Turkish forces and their Syrian auxiliaries oust the Kurdish militia from the town of Afrin and raise the Turkish flag.\n\nScenes of looting by pro-Turkish fighters draw condemnation.\n\nPro-Turkish forces strengthen their control of Afrin, which is emptied of its tens of thousands of inhabitants.\n\nThe fighting displaces about half of the Kurdish enclave\u2019s 320,000 people, according to the United Nations, while rights groups document abuses after the Turkish-backed rebel takeover.\n\nAmnesty International has charged that the Turkish armed forces have \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to violations.\n\nNearly 300 civilians were killed in the operation, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.\n\nAlso dead are around 1,500 Kurdish militiamen and 400 pro-Turkish fighters, it says.\n\nTurkey says it lost 45 soldiers.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Turkey has previously launched two operations into Syria \u2014 in 2016 and 2018 \u2014 to push back from its border Islamic State", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
