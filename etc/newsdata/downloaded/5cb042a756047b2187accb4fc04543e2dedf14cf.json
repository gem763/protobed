The studio is unrivaled at designing exhilarating fantasy firearms to shoot at monstrous, primordial aliens, all against the backdrop of awe-inspiring, otherworldly vistas. But it\u2019s fallen short of mixing those high-octane mechanical elements with the narrative and social scope of a true massively multiplayer online game, in the vein of World of Warcraft and other titles that inspired it.\n\nI also thought Destiny would remain beholden to its publisher Activision, resulting in all sorts of decision-making and business choices that run counter to delivering the best possible product. For instance, I believed all the progress I\u2019ve sunk into the game on PS4, including more than 700 hundred hours of Destiny 2, would remain stuck there, where a dwindling group of my friends still picked up the game every week. It had never occurred to me that Activision, or platform owner Sony, would ever let my account migrate elsewhere. I considered it a non-starter.\n\nShadowkeep, the latest expansion for Destiny 2, has made me reconsider all of this. The game now features cross-save, meaning I\u2019ve moved my account over to Steam on PC, after Bungie split with Activision and acquired the rights to the game earlier this year. The studio has also restructured its entire release model to accommodate a new free-to-play version, a seasonal battle pass to help fund future expansions, and an ambitious release model that promises new activities and interweaving storylines at a steady clip throughout the year, instead of in large batches that dry up quickly.\n\nShadowkeep itself is not the biggest or most ambitious expansion the series has ever seen \u2014 that continues to be last year\u2019s Forsaken. It\u2019s also not the most impressive from a narrative standpoint, as some of its new missions and activities feel a bit too steeped in the game\u2019s arcane backstory. But taking into account those long-term changes to how the game will be designed and distributed, as well as played across platforms, Shadowkeep is without a doubt the strongest representation of Bungie\u2019s ultimate vision for Destiny to date.\n\nFor those who have never played Destiny 2 or its predecessor, there is not much I can tell you about Shadowkeep\u2019s plot or the actual meat of the expansion that will make much sense. But to lapsed players or those aware of the game\u2019s general themes, the game\u2019s Guardians (that\u2019s you) find themselves returning to the Moon, the original off-planet destination from Destiny 1.\n\nThere, the warriors of the Traveler, an ancient life form that can imbue human beings and other aliens with supernatural powers and resurrection abilities, are investigating a threat that Bungie has been building toward for about half a decade. In the first game, it was called the Darkness, an all-consuming evil that stands in opposition to the Traveler that always manifested itself in intangible ways, usually by corrupting alien races. The studio dropped the clumsy naming scheme for its villain with Destiny 2, but the general outline remains the same. It\u2019s an evil entity, and it wants to destroy humanity. So you must fight it.\n\nPlayers that love \u2018Destiny\u2019 lore will enjoy returning to the Moon and reuniting with Eris Morn\n\nThis is all well and good, and players that love Destiny lore will have a fine time returning to the Moon and reuniting with fan-favorite character Eris Morn. Exploring the old location filled me with nostalgia, and the new strike, the generally well-designed story missions, and the six-person raid activity all feel like a proper culmination of Bungie\u2019s storytelling evolution with Destiny. There are also scores of weapons and armor pieces to collect and lots of lofty goals and milestones to spend your time striving for, including a new power cap and in-game triumphs and titles to earn mostly for bragging rights.\n\nBungie has also begun introducing concurrent storylines to help build out its narrative over the course of weeks and months of real-world time. When I logged in last weekend, a new cutscene showed the machine race Vex invading the Moon. It marked the launch of an all-new seasonal activity, tied to the launch of the Vex-themed raid, called Vex Offensive. It was not a part of Shadowkeep\u2019s campaign, but an all-new separate story thread.\n\nBungie has a road map planned for the Moon\u2019s endgame \u201cNightmare Hunts\u201d and Vex Offensive that both build toward higher-level activities that only unlock late in October and November, alongside a new quest for a coveted exotic weapon and the launch of a new dungeon (Destiny parlance for a mini raid). This all feels very much like Bungie learning from its multiplayer competitors, primarily those in the battle royale scene, about how to properly pace a seasonal content model.\n\nYet evaluating the success or failure of Destiny and any of its expansions is less about critiquing the story or the individual moving parts, and more about how the game treats your time. And overall, Bungie has overhauled Destiny 2 in surprising ways that make it feel like it\u2019s stepping much closer to the true shooter-MMO hybrid it was always designed to be.\n\nA standout change in Shadowkeep is Bungie bringing every one of your characters up to the starting light level of the expansion, ensuring players don\u2019t spend countless hours grinding out mindless and otherwise months-old activities just to be on an even playing field. The studio also simplified its infusion system so you can upgrade lower-level gear more easily, and totally reworked its armor customization options to make them more in line with a true RPG.\n\nBungie has learned to balance its hardcore gameplay with more casual fare\n\nIn many ways, this is evidence of Bungie finding the right balance between overtly demanding and time-consuming \u201chardcore\u201d gameplay and more casual fare. Destiny 2\u2019s entire first year was a string of compounding failures that only revealed themselves as counterintuitive steps months after release, when the player base began complaining that there was nothing to do and the game\u2019s deficiencies became more evident. Bungie, in its quest to make the game more accessible and less like a second job, had instead drained Destiny of its most vital and sticky elements.\n\nOver the course of the last 18 months or so, the studio has been carefully returning removed features, tweaking existing systems and adding new ones, and overall, striking a better middle ground. That way, players can play the game at length without feeling like they\u2019re pushing a boulder up a hill without a summit. When Forsaken launched in September of last year, it felt like Bungie had turned a corner and turned the game into something spectacular again. This has continued as an ongoing, incremental process over the course of the last three post-Forsaken expansions. But with Shadowkeep, that vision feels more fully formed than ever.\n\nDestiny 2 is far from perfect. The game\u2019s competitive Crucible multiplayer \u2014 once occupying an entire half of the original game \u2014 is still in shambles, plagued by balance issues, patches that arrive at a glacial pace, and an overall lack of developer attention. Streamers have all but abandoned Destiny 2 for that reason alone.\n\nThe game\u2019s Crucible mode is still in shambles\n\nAdditionally, Bungie, in its attempt to bring players back to the game starting with Forsaken, overcorrected in my opinion. Many of the activities, starting with the Black Armory expansion in late 2018, became far too time-consuming. I saw almost all of my friends, who played Forsaken practically daily, get burned out and move on because Destiny 2 began demanding so much of their time.\n\nThat is less true now with Shadowkeep and all the ways Bungie has streamlined many of its more obnoxiously grind-y elements. And a lot of the old quests from the post-Forsaken expansions are still available and much easier to tackle now that you\u2019re not struggling against the power cap. But I still feel like Bungie continues to undershoot and then overcorrect in cyclical fashion. I\u2019m worried Shadowkeep will bring lots of players back (and plenty of new ones playing the free-to-play version), only for the next expansion to lose them again.\n\nThat brings us to the most important question about Destiny 2, and one Shadowkeep will not reliably answer: where is this game going, and at what point does it stop being worth your time? Bungie has endured a roller-coaster post-launch development cycle to appease die-hard fans and reinvigorate its game. It also broke up with its publishing partner to help forge a new path and do with Destiny what it always wanted to.\n\nBy all accounts, that\u2019s panning out. That cross-save has worked as well as it does \u2014 despite a massive launch day outage \u2014 is nothing short of astounding. That it exists at all, in part thanks to games like Fortnite, is something of a miracle. And for people entering the Destiny universe as free-to-play players for the first time, they\u2019re getting their hands on something that I\u2019ve spent hundreds of dollars on. And I\u2019m not mad these same people are getting that content for free; it\u2019s money I consider well spent for the value I received at the time.\n\nBungie has not said whether there will be a \u2018Destiny 3\u2019 coming next year\n\nBungie hasn\u2019t said whether there will be a Destiny 3. We know there will be a full year of expansions after Shadowkeep, because there is an annual pass attached that promises seasonal content through next summer. But part of the pitch with Bungie going independent was that the studio would no longer have to sell units and hit revenue goals that were set by another company.\n\nDoes that mean Destiny will become a true service game that lives on for years to come, like World of Warcraft or, in a more apt comparison, its competitor Warframe? We don\u2019t know. And that does cast some doubt on the future of the series. Why would I keep playing this game if it\u2019s just going to get rebooted again in 12 months? As was the case with the final year of Destiny 1 before the sequel\u2019s launch in the fall of 2017. And how will next year\u2019s new game consoles from Microsoft and Sony impact the developer\u2019s plans? We don\u2019t know that either.\n\nFor now, though, Bungie is asking its players for trust. If I were asked to make that same leap of faith last year, ahead of Forsaken and when the game seemed to be at its lowest point, I would have walked away. But I\u2019m glad I stuck with Destiny 2, because it\u2019s done nothing but improve in the months since. After Shadowkeep, I feel confident the game will only continue to step closer to Bungie\u2019s grand vision it first conceived nearly a decade ago. And half a decade and thousands of hours later, I can easily see myself playing another five years of Destiny.", "description": "Shadowkeep, the latest expansion for Bungie\u2019s Destiny 2, has made me reconsider what I thought the game was capable of.
