Of the more than 12,300 medicines licensed in the U.K., about 7,000 arrive from or via the EU, mostly across the Channel.\n\nAccording to the British government\u2019s \u201creasonable worst-case\u201d scenario, the flow of goods could be cut by half on Day One of a no-deal Brexit and could take a year to recover. It said time was \u201cextremely limited\u201d if the shipping issues were to be resolved by the end of October.\n\nThe report also said there was \u201cincomplete information\u201d about the levels of medicine stockpiling but that levels were increasingly daily. As of Sept. 20, suppliers reported that 72% of medicines had a six-week stockpile.\n\n\u201cIn the event of a no-deal exit, the department (of health) would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task,\u201d the watchdog wrote.\n\nMeg Hillier, who chairs a committee overseeing the audit office, called the findings \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d She said she had seen \u201ccountless examples\u201d of the British government missing deadlines, but that this one was particularly striking.\n\n\u201cIf the government gets this wrong, it could have the gravest of consequences,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Richard Torbett of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said that while companies have been working to prepare for Brexit, \u201csome things are outside of their control.\u201d\n\nHe said more details were needed on how companies might access government-planned freight capacity if Britain sees a no-deal departure from the EU.\n\n\u201cSecuring a (Brexit) deal remains the best way to protect patients,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at: https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Britain's government watchdog says there is still a \"significant amount\" of work to do to ensure the country has an adequate supply of medical drugs in case of a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Maria Cheng"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
