Without worrying about what Number 10 [Downing Street] might say.\"\n\nHe added: \"My word is the law, not some unaccountable person who might be saying something off record.\n\n\"What I say and what the prime minister says matters far more than anything else.\"\n\nBuckland was a guest speaker at a reception hosted by the Tory Reform Group of moderate Conservatives, where Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan was also a speaker.\n\nDominic Grieve, who Downing Street recently sacked as a Conservative MP after voted to stop a no-deal Brexit, was also in attendance.", "description": "Justice Secretary Robert Buckland warned that the Conservatives will struggle to get back into government if they lose the next election.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d91d6692e22af41d711caf2-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
