It is also the final of the World Boxing Super Series - they have each won twice to get here - and the winner takes away the enormous Muhammad Ali Trophy, the golden trinket of trinkets.\n\nPrograis is unbeaten in 24, Taylor in 15, they are in their old-fashioned fighting primes, matched in the rarest of fights at a time and in an age when boxers have so many reasons to avoid risks. \u201cThey both deserve praise for fighting each other - I\u2019m not sure they would be if I was in charge,\u201d admitted Eddie Hearn, the fight\u2019s promoter.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere is something ancient about Taylor\u2019s look as he met with Prograis, his drawn face as the hours slowly pass before he steps on the scales, his edginess to remain polite when all he wants to do is let his fists fly and the way he steals iron glances at Prograis. It\u2019s a real fighter at work, oblivious to image.\n\nPrograis has been in London for three weeks preparing for the fight, a bold move in modern days and the snatched ring reports from gyms where doors have been pulled closed, not locked tight, have been impressive; Prograis tried to land here as a boxer in disguise as a happy tourist, a smart part of his subtle deception. The bookies favour him ever so slightly and dozens of local experts, men that have caught a glimpse, do so heavily.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nTaylor has the deeper amateur pedigree, Prograis the hard, short life in various spit-bucket American gyms and more professional fights; Taylor\u2019s opponents, during the last year or so, have been better than the duo Prograis beat, but it is Prograis carrying the expectation and Prograis is the one getting mentioned for big fights next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure who he thinks he is?\u201d said Taylor, who had called him a \u201cwanker\u201d and told him to take his sunglasses off. \u201cHe is acting like it is his city, but he needs all those guys around him, shouting and building him up. I don\u2019t need anybody to tell me that I will win by knockout.\u201d\n\nThere has been too much talk of knockout power, of the fight ending before the final bell, but the chatter is possibly just a convenient illusion to conceal the real intent; when they have each met tough men, good men in boxing circles, they have both been stretched the full twelve rounds and that outcome looks possible again.\n\n\u201cHe has a real problem,\u201d continued Taylor. \u201cHe just thinks it will be an easy fight for him and that\u2019s a bad mistake to make at any level in boxing - at this level, the highest level, it is crazy. I know just hard it will be, I prepared that way.\u201d It is an astute observation.\n\nPrograis is physically smaller, trailing on all measures, but he has sensibly dismissed the traditional tale-of-the-tape and the often misleading figures it measures. There is no way of equating the dangers of weight loss, the threat of complacency or any of the other factors that really decide fights; nobody cares any longer about a boxer\u2019s chest dimensions, the size of his fist.\n\n\u201cThis fight will not be won because he\u2019s taller,\u201d insisted Prograis. \u201cIt will be won because he\u2019s been hurt before and I will hurt him again - I told him that. That\u2019s the difference, I will get to him and finish him. That\u2019s the story of this fight.\u201d\n\nThe fight will be won and lost by the boxer with the smartest plan once the first bell sounds, the adrenaline flows and they instantly display their nerves; it is telling that nobody expects Prograis to panic, which might well be a blind spot by people sitting in judgement and prediction.\n\nTaylor will be calm in any crisis, Prograis has never been near a crisis in his boxing life - his other life has been chaotic with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 forcing him to flee New Orleans - and this is a fight that will easily drag the pair across the line of their previous sacrifices. The winner, in what is a rare 50-50 fight at this level, will not just have to be the smartest, he will also have to be the one that can respond to the crisis - this is a fight where desire will triumph. Taylor can win on points in a classic.", "description": "On Thursday afternoon by the Thames in east London, against the backdrop of a black-out storm, Regis Prograis wore sunglasses as he sat opposite Josh Taylor for the last time before they fight at the O2 on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Steve Bunce"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/25/13/Josh-Taylor-Regis-Prograis-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
