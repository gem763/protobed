(Senior Airman Sean Campbell/U.S. Air Force)\n\nFor 13 years, the United States has used a single building in this tiny gulf state to command fighter jets, bombers, drones and other Air Force assets in a region that stretches from Northeast Africa through the Middle East to South Asia.\n\nAnd yet on Saturday, as 300 planes were in the air in key areas such as Syria, Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf, hundreds of seats at the Combined Air and Space Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar sat empty.\n\nInstead, the air power of the United States and its allies was being controlled by teams at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina \u2014 more than 7,000 miles away. Though the move was only temporary \u2014 Al Udeid took back control on Sunday after 24 hours \u2014 it was a significant tactical shift.\n\nThe unannounced operation, which The Washington Post was invited to observe, was the first time U.S. command and control had been moved out of the region since the center was established in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.\n\nWhile Air Force commanders say moving functions to a different base was a long-held ambition enabled by new technology, it comes amid renewed tension with Iran, a country that lies only a couple hundred miles across the Persian Gulf from Al Udeid.\n\n\u201cThe functions that the CAOC provides for air power are so critical and so essential that we can't afford to have a single point of failure,\u201d said Maj. Gen. B. Chance Saltzman, using an acronym for the center.\n\n\n\nAirmen inside the 609th Air Support Squadron\u2019s Shaw Air Operations Center at Shaw Air Force Base prepare for the transition. (Tech. Sgt. Matthew Rosine/U.S. Air Force)\n\nAir Force officials said recent incidents involving Iran helped add urgency to the project. Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in June; this month, key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia suffered a devastating surprise attack with what appeared to be Iranian-supplied weapons.\n\n[Billions spent on U.S. weapons didn\u2019t protect Saudi Arabia\u2019s most critical oil sites from a crippling attack]\n\n\u201cIran has indicated multiple times through multiple sources their intent to attack U.S. forces,\u201d said Col. Frederick Coleman, commander of the 609th Air and Space Operations Center.\n\n\u201cFrankly, as the war against ISIS winds down and as we continue to work through a potential peace process in Afghanistan, the region is calming down and potentially more stable than it has been in decades,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept for Iran.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say that if a conflict with Iran were to break out, it\u2019s likely that the combined air and space operations center at Al Udeid could be targeted and that there is little guarantee that it could be defended.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a whole heap of imagination to look at it and think, if push came to shove and it was a full blown conflict, it would be one of the priority targets,\u201d said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow specializing in aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\nThe bases\u2019 defense systems, which include Patriot batteries and other high-end missile defense, are designed mostly to combat planes and ballistic missiles that come in fast and from a high altitude, rather than low-flying cruise missiles and drones like those believed to have been used in the attack on the Saudi oil facilities.\n\nSaltzman said the practicalities of missile defense made complete protection impossible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really probably better to think about this as an immune system,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be germs that get into the body. It\u2019s about how fast and how resilient you can fight it off.\u201d\n\n[In standoff with Iran, Trump is reaping what he sowed]\n\nBy making the command and control operations mobile, the United States could rebound from an attack far quicker. That flexibility would also make the building that houses them at Al Udeid a less valuable target, which would allow them to redeploy air defense systems to other critical infrastructure.\n\nThe operation to move the center was the culmination a number of measures that the United States has taken to broadcast to the region that its Air Force is not only the world\u2019s strongest \u2014 it\u2019s also agile.\n\nThese moves included deploying formidable fighters such as the F-35 from their home base at Al Dhafra in the United Arab Emirates to bases in Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2014 movements that require considerable logistical coordination, given that support staff such as maintenance teams need to travel, too.\n\nByron Pompa, U.S. Air Force Central Command operations director at Al Udeid, said moving facilities and equipment often could compensate for not having a huge footprint across the region.\n\n\u201cIn times like today,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can\u2019t have a ton of permanent-fixture operating bases throughout the area of responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is deterrence,\u201d Saltzman said, not conflict. But the lack of communication with Iran can make sending that message difficult. The United States has to use other measures, he said, including turning off radar from time to time or planning flight routes to make it clear it does not intend to attack.\n\n[ Iran\u2019s gamble: Analysts say brazen attack aimed to pressure U.S. with little fear of reprisal]\n\nThe aim now is to run the center remotely once a month and remain the rest of the time at Al Udeid. Commanders want to work up to a schedule in which the center is operated remotely for eight hours of every 24-hour period, either at Shaw or elsewhere.\n\nOfficials at Al Udeid said there was no plan to close the center permanently. They said some functions there could not be replicated remotely. But they plan to transfer some of the 800 positions to U.S. soil in the future.\n\n\u201cThe goodness here is now we\u2019re saving taxpayer dollars that we\u2019re giving back to America,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd, you know, America\u2019s sons and daughters aren\u2019t abroad in the Middle East. They\u2019re home.\u201d\n\nFor gulf allies that have invested in facilities used by the United States in the region, the move might be worrying. Qatar in particular has spent heavily on Al Udeid in recent years, spending as much as $1.8 billion to renovate the base, the largest in the region, capable of housing more than 10,000 U.S. troops.\n\nBut the combination of resurgent risks and new technology is leading the United States to reconsider how much of its operations need to be based abroad.\n\nAs Coleman led journalists on a tour of the cavernous site on Saturday, he joked about working from his iPad.\n\n\u201cEventually, I\u2019d like to be able to do this from Starbucks.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nJamal Khashoggi\u2019s death made the Saudi crown prince a pariah.
