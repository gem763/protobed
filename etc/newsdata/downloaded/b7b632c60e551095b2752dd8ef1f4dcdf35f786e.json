We don\u2019t want the president receiving fat envelopes from foreign dignitaries for fear that that\u2019ll influence his views on foreign policy. Imagine if, say, the president of Ukraine could curry favor with POTUS by telling him that he recently paid for the privilege of staying in one of his luxurious properties in the United States. That would look like petty bribery! Hosting a summit of world leaders like the G7 where attendance by the member nations is compulsory doesn\u2019t work the same way. The president is still enriched, but no one\u2019s purchasing any special favor from him by being there.\n\nIt\u2019s not even clear that Trump will profit from the event if in fact he ends up hosting the event at cost, as Mick Mulvaney claimed earlier today.\n\nBut of course Napolitano\u2019s read is defensible too. By handing the G7 to Trump National Doral, Trump is brazenly using the leverage he has over foreign policy by dint of his office to line his own pockets with foreign government money. Profit might not be necessary; revenue might be enough. Even if there\u2019s no profit, the PR generated for the resort by its role in the G7 is doubtless worth millions. The corruption is so flagrant, the optics are so poor, that Pelosi and Nadler must be tempted to add it to the eventual articles of impeachment as a gross violation of the Emoluments Clause. That would complicate their messaging on impeachment since it\u2019s supposed to be all about Ukraine and quid pro quos, but the public is likely to view his G7 move as so blatantly improper that there\u2019s really no downside to Dems in tossing it in there. At the very least, it\u2019ll force Senate Republicans to offer some uncomfortable explanations after they acquit Trump as to why self-dealing on this scale somehow doesn\u2019t warrant removal from office.\n\nI mean, look at what this poor defeated chump has been reduced to in order to cover for the president:\n\nRubio said he's not sure Trump's hotel would really make money anyway with an event like the G7, and says others in the area will benefit too. \u2014 Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) October 17, 2019\n\nThere are no other properties in the state of Florida that might have sufficed for the G7 and which wouldn\u2019t have involved fattening up the president\u2019s bank account, Marco? Between this and how he spun Trump\u2019s comments a few weeks ago about China investigating Hunter Biden, it\u2019s clear that Rubio has essentially checked out of politics. He\u2019ll defend Trump dutifully as needed but his defenses will be conspicuously phoned-in.\n\nLike I say, the clip is also interesting for how it\u2019s being promoted. With Shep Smith\u2019s departure, one might have expected the Fox networks to begin steering towards even more ardent Trump-worship. And it would have been fair to assume that Andrew Napolitano, whose comments about Trump ignited the Shep/Tucker spat that led to Smith leaving, might either lie low or tone it down. Nope: Here\u2019s Napolitano swinging away on Fox Business with full encouragement from Neil Cavuto, who, if anything, may be turning more aggressive in challenging Trump spin now that Shep is gone. So Fox is willing to let its personnel punish Trump for the G7 thing. And Matt Drudge is willing to help: As I write this at 6:45 p.m. ET, this very clip is highlighted in red font at the top of the Drudge Report, the latest example of surprisingly harsh coverage of Trump on a webpage that normally leans right. Is Drudge pro-impeachment? Or is Drudge reacting in this particular instance to the fact that Trump awarding the G7 to his own property is egregiously, cartoonishly improper, maybe anticipating that his readers will be outraged too?\n\nBy the way, speaking of Fox, Megyn Kelly\u2019s return to the network last night on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show drew bombshell ratings, crushing even Hannity and Rachel Maddow with more than four million viewers. Conveniently, Fox is now looking for a news anchor to host Shep\u2019s 3 p.m. slot.
