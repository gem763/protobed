The revenue would be used to pay for his programs like Medicare for All, universal child care and housing programs.\n\nA 1% tax for households with a net worth of more than $32 million for a married couple would increase to 2% for households worth $50 million to $250 million, 3% from $250 million to $500 million, 4% on $500 million to $1 billion. The tax would cap at 8% on wealth above $10 billion.\n\nWarren\u2019s wealth tax begins with 2% on households worth $50 million or more.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign said his wealth tax would slash U.S. billionaires\u2019 wealth in half in 15 years, \u201cwhich would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sanders, a Vermont senator, said in a statement. \u201cWe are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy.\u201d\n\nTo ensure the wealthiest Americans don\u2019t evade the tax, the plans calls for the creation of a \u201cnational wealth registry\u201d and \u201csignificant additional third-party reporting requirements.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service would be required to perform audits of 30% of wealth tax returns for those in the 1% bracket and all billionaires\u2019 wealth tax returns would be audited.\n\nFor those who seek to leave the country to avoid the wealth tax, Sanders calls for a 40% exit levy on the net value of all assets of less than $1 billion and of 60% on assets greater than $1 billion.\n\nThe plan would treat assets in a trust \u201cas owned by the grantor of the trust (by the person giving assets to the trust) until that person\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nIn January, before he announced his presidential run, Sanders proposed expanding the estate tax, calling for a rate of 45% tax on the value of estates between $3.5 million and $10 million. That rate would increase gradually to 77% for amounts more than $1 billion.\n\nEconomists for the Sanders campaign estimate that had the wealth tax been enacted in 1982, the total wealth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans would be 40% of what it currently is, and they would have a net worth of $3 billion on average, instead of the average $7.2 billion they held last year.\n\n\u201cThe share of wealth owned by the Forbes 400 would not have exploded and would only be slightly higher than it was in the early 1980s,\u201d say economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez who analyzed the proposal for the campaign and designed Warren\u2019s tax plan. \u201cThe current top 15 wealthiest Americans would own $196 billion (instead of the $943 billion they own in 2018).\u201d\n\n(Updates with polling in 2nd paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Emma Kinery in Washington at ekinery@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Kevin Whitelaw\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a proposal for a wealth tax that takes Elizabeth Warren\u2019s signature idea and pushes it even further, saying his goal is to cut American billionaires\u2019 fortunes in half over 15 years.Sanders, who is struggling to maintain his top-three standing in the Democratic", "authors": ["Emma Kinery"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1u09XTOIgXEp5ihN8V8Dfg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-308259-1569351980377.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
