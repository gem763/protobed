The roles of wing and full-back are very interchangeable,\" Watson said. \"Playing wing in the last two games gives me a better perspective on what's expected from the full-back and what the full-back expects from his wingers.\n\n\"I just need to be very vocal, apart from that nothing really changes. It's very similar to playing full-back at club rugby.\n\n\"There are little intricacies that are different and there are details that are heightened, which you would expect from international rugby.\"\n\nWhile England flew into Newcastle on Thursday from their preparations in Treviso, Italy have spent the full week getting to grips with the north-east, although while O\u2019Shea insists their attentions are on this final run-out before the World Cup, he did admit it is all about getting ready for their Pool B opener in Japan against Namibia.\n\n\"We will face one of the strongest teams in the world in a match that represents a new step in our preparation for the Rugby World Cup,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cWe will have a new opportunity to assess the players' state of form, in order to understand later how to continue the path to the first match against Namibia. But now our focus is on England.\u201d", "description": "Twenty of England\u2019s matchday 23 will begin Friday night\u2019s final Rugby World Cup warm-up game knowing than an injury will stand a very good chance of ruling them out of the flight to Japan fewer than 48 hours later.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/16/anthony-watson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
