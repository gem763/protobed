Many Kashmiris hostile to India's rule often gather to throw stones at security forces after militants are killed.\n\nIn a separate incident in south Kashmir's Pulwama district, suspected militants shot dead a migrant worker from Chhattisgarh state, in central India, in an execution-style killing, police said.\n\nThe brick kiln laborer was walking along a railway track in the Kakapora area when he was stopped by two people. \"He was shot in the head,\" a police official said, declining to be named.\n\nIn another incident, a fruit merchant was killed and another critically wounded when gunmen fired at them in the Shopian district of south Kashmir.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Fayaz Bukhari in Srinagar; Writing by Alasdair Pal and Manoj Kumar; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Nick Macfie)", "description": "Indian security forces killed three separatists, while  suspected militants shot dead two people on Wednesday, one of the bloodiest days in Kashmir since New Delhi revoked the disputed region's autonomy more than two months ago.
