Add Boeing as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Boeing news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe airline said Thursday that it expects the grounding of its Max jets to cut full-year pretax earnings by about $540 million. During the three months ended in September, the Max grounding cut pretax income by about $140 million.\n\nEven with the loss of its 24 Max planes and others it had expected to receive this year, American earned $425 million during the quarter, up 14%, with help from lower fuel prices.\n\nChairman and CEO Doug Parker said, however, that the results should have been better were it not for the Max grounding and ongoing labor-contract negotiations. American sued its mechanics' unions over what it viewed as an illegal work slowdown that caused some summer flights to be delayed or canceled.\n\nParker promised that American is \"taking decisive action to correct this performance,\" and spoke in upbeat terms about 2020 and beyond.\n\nFor 2019, however, the company narrowed its full-year profit forecast to between $4.50 and $5.50 per share from $4.50 to $6.\n\nAdjusted third-quarter profit was $1.42 per share, topping Wall Street expectations for $1.38, according to Zacks Investment Research.\n\nRevenue was a record $11.91 billion, a sliver shy of expectations.\n\nLower prices for jet fuel allowed American to cut its fuel bill by $245 million, or 11%, compared with a year earlier.\n\nIn trading before the opening bell, shares of Fort Worth-based American Airlines Group Inc. were down 29 cents to $28.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
