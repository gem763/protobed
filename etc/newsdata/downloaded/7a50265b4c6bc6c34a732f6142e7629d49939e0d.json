Trump on the other hand chose his words deliberately today in his use of the word lynching and continues to stoke racial divides in this country daily,\u201d the former vice president wrote on social media.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the right word to use and I\u2019m sorry about that.

In the interview, Biden condemned the GOP\u2019s push for impeachment during the interview, likening it to a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if the President should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense,\u201d said Biden, who at the time was the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDespite using similar language in 1998, Biden lambasted Trump for claiming the recently launched impeachment inquiry impeded on right to due process and therefore amounted to \u201ca lynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpeachment is not \u2018lynching,\u2019 it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent,\u201d Biden said in response to Trump\u2019s claims. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable.\u201d\n\nImpeachment is not \"lynching,\" it is part of our Constitution.

It's despicable. https://t.co/QcC25vhNeb \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 22, 2019\n\nThe former vice president is not the only high-profile Democrat to have described impeachment as a \u201clynching\u201d during the Clinton years, but now finds the term repugnant when used by Trump. As Breitbart News reported on Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) similary claimed Republicans were \u201crunning a lynch mob\u201d during the Clinton imbroglio.\n\n\u201cI am the president\u2019s defender in the sense that I haven\u2019t seen anything yet that would rise, in my opinion, to the level of impeachable offense,\u201d Nadler said in 1998. \u201cIn pushing the process, in pushing the arguments of fairness and due process the Republicans so far have been running a lynch mob.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden attempted to walk back comments he made in 1998 likening the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton to a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Joe-Biden-on-Tuesday-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
