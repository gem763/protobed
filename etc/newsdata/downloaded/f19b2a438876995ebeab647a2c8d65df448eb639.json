It's been a busier than normal holiday period.\"\n\nJapanese visitors and Australians on driving holidays were most likely to want to scale Uluru, Mr Schwer said, though he urged them not to do so.\n\nAustralian tourist Belinda Moore, 33, drove to Uluru from her home in central Queensland state to ascend the rock, an experience she said she \"absolutely loved\".\n\n\"It's always been something to tick off the bucket list and when we heard it was closing, we knew it was now or never,\" she told AFP.\n\nMs Moore said she did not think her climb was disrespectful to traditional owners as she was not Aboriginal.\n\n\"It may be for their own people, because it's their sacred site,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm pretty sad that they're closing it, but it's still amazing just to see it. I would still recommend it.\"\n\nThe climb will be permanently closed as of October 26, the anniversary of ownership being handed back to the Anangu people.\n\nUluru has great spiritual and cultural significance to indigenous Australians, with their connection to the site dating back tens of thousands of years.\n\nThough visitor numbers were expected to decline once the ban was in place, Schwer said local tourism operators were \"not particularly concerned\" as it would return the area to normality.\n\n\"People need to remember that in central Australia we're a very interconnected community,\" he said. \"The people who are requesting the climb closure are our friends and colleagues.\n\n\"We're just looking forward to being able to have the climb consigned to the annals of history.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Life & Culture - [SYDNEY] Large numbers of tourists are rushing to scale Uluru - also known as Ayers Rock - ahead of a looming ban on climbing a site sacred to indigenous Australians. .
