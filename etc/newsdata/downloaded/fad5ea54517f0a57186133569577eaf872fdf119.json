Photo: John Middlebrook/CSM/Shutterstoc/John Middlebrook/CSM/Shutterstoc\n\nThis afternoon, right-wing hucksters Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman held another press conference. Wohl and Burkman frequently and lazily concoct political scandals out of thin air and then fail to back them up. They are regarded, far and wide, as a joke. They tried unsuccessfully to Me Too Robert Mueller. Earlier this month, they leveled allegations that Elizabeth Warren was having an affair with a much younger former Marine. Today, they alleged that Senator Ted Cruz was a swinger.\n\nYou should not care about this pair. I need to be very clear on that. They are big ol\u2019 dummies and every blog post about them (including this one) is giving them oxygen.\n\nThat being said, their audio-visual setup is wild. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. It\u2019s so funny. It tickles me. Every time they hold one of these dumb press conferences in Burkman\u2019s driveway, I see this ramshackle AV setup and laugh. It\u2019s baffling. It keeps me up at night. I have an idiot disease and the cause is this collection of furniture and appliances.\n\nReporting live from the Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman press conference at Jack Burkman\u2019s Arlington home\u2019s driveway.\n\n\n\nTwo private security guards are here and there is a TV that says \u201cPress Conference.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo sign of a \u201cProtest Against Homophobic Bigots\u201d but there is Dunkin Donuts. pic.twitter.com/rniUJHobNE \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) May 8, 2019\n\nGenerally, each presser has the same setup, as seen in the tweet above from this past May. All of it has the vibe of when you gave your parents a \u201cWhy I Should Be Allowed to Have a Nintendo\u201d presentation in third grade.\n\nAt the top of the 12 steps leading up to Burkman\u2019s stoop is a lectern. Below that, at a slight jag in the staircase, is a side table with a flat-screen TV on top of it. There is also a sound system with some heavy-duty speakers connected to a mic at the lectern.\n\nBlundering pro-Trump smear artists Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl are at it again today with another press conference in Burkman\u2019s driveway. As always: these guys love to lie and Jacob is facing a felony charge. I\u2019ll be tweeting sparingly if at all. pic.twitter.com/DY99KgEVsF \u2014 Will Sommer (@willsommer) October 3, 2019\n\nGod, all of it makes me laugh. It sends me into a downward spiral whenever I see it. This setup exists in the space between impromptu and rehearsed. The tech set reflects the people they are: amateurs cosplaying as pros. They wear suits to their own press conferences, where they haul a table and a TV out from the living room and plop it on the porch. But they are also so committed to this bit that they have a robust speaker setup for their dozen or so attendees. It\u2019s all incongruous.\n\nTheir security guard just wears one AirPod? Who could he possibly be talking to? He\u2019s the only guard.\n\njacob wohl is giving his cpac presser while flanked by a tiny security guard with a single airpod in his ear pic.twitter.com/tGt4vjI6oh \u2014 Caleb Ecarma (@calebecarma) February 28, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have money. The alleged victims they pull out of the woodwork to smear others are often paid. A man that the pair recruited to level bogus claims against Kamala Harris said he was hired off of a Craigslist ad seeking \u201ca male actor in their early 20\u2019s to early 30\u2019s for basic performance art acting\u201d and promising $250 an hour, according to the Daily Beast.\n\nGentleman, you could put that money toward better equipment, maybe an outdoor projection system. You do not have to keep hauling furniture that clearly is from Burkman\u2019s living room out to the driveway. That table has a glass top; if you slip while carrying it down the steps, you could be in real trouble.\n\nToday\u2019s Jacob Wohl press conference topic: pic.twitter.com/48cSCHlrpw \u2014 Will Sommer (@willsommer) October 3, 2019\n\nIt is so funny to me that there\u2019s a lectern. Why is there a lectern? The pair hosts these press conferences with enough frequency that I have to assume they own a lectern. That\u2019s funny to me; keeping a lectern on hand just in case you need to give a press conference about horny politicians. \u201cJacob, my man, we gotta break out the lectern.\u201d\n\nYou guys, guess where I am. pic.twitter.com/uxs73bw6wh \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) October 21, 2019\n\nIconic. There are wires everywhere. Guys, what are you doing? Clean up these cables. They\u2019re just sitting there in a tangled nest on the steps. I live in a crappy, tiny apartment and even I keep my AV cables tucked out of site. Have some self-respect. Also, someone could trip. Again, I\u2019d like to stress the glass table.\n\nOh, another question I just thought of. Why is the TV in front of the podium? That seems like an oversight. They can\u2019t see the TV. How are they going to know what\u2019s on the TV?\n\nI love the optics of it. I am enraptured by the \u201coutdoor community playhouse production\u201d aesthetic. I hate these hucksters, but you gotta hand it to them: They\u2019re working with what they\u2019ve got (which is one full-size lectern, a midsize flat-screen TV, a tasteful side table, two pro-grade speakers, and a couple of semi-functional brains).", "description": "The pair have made a name for themselves conducting impromptu, defamatory press conferences aimed at political opponents.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/21/21-jacob-wohl-jack-burkman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
