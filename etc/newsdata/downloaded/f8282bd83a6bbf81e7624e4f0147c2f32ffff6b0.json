He will be making a quick turnaround when he faces Anderson next month.\n\nAnderson is coming off back-to-back wins over Zak Bucia and, most recently, Guilherme Bomba this past weekend at Bellator 229. It will be an even quicker turnaround for Anderson, who will be heading into hostile territory to try to put a halt to Page\u2019s new momentum.\n\nThe Bellator Europe 6 lineup now includes:\n\nMichael Page vs. Derek Anderson\n\nFabian Edwards vs. Mike Shipman\n\nTerry Brazier vs. Soren Bak\n\nCharlie Leary vs. Tim Wilde\n\nDaniel Crawford vs. Robert Whiteford\n\nAlfie Davis vs. Myles Price\n\nWalter Gahadza vs. Lewis Long\n\nKent Kauppinen vs. Andy Manzolov\n\nDenise Kielholtz vs. Sabriye Sengul\n\nHarry Hardwick vs. Nathan Rose\n\nTom Mearns vs. Jeremy Petley\n\nDamian Frankiewicz vs. Aiden Lee\n\nKevin Fryer vs. George Tokkos\n\nTom Green vs. Akonne Wanliss\n\n\u2018Super\u2019 Shane Campbell vs. Raphael Uchegbu", "description": "A welterweight matchup between Michael Page and Derek Anderson will headline Bellator's return to London in November.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Christian Stein", "Dave Doyle", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/michael-page-bellator-228-2.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
