Walden is the 20th Republican to say he will forgo reelection to the House in 2020, compared with just seven Democrats.\n\nWalden is also the fifth Republican in a top committee post to announce retirement plans this year.

He also previously owned and operated multiple radio stations.\n\nThe Oregon Republican easily won his reelection in 2018. The district is expected to stay in GOP hands.\n\n\u201cBased on recent polling, strong fundraising, and the backing of my wife and family, I am confident I could earn the support of 2nd District voters for another term,\u201d Walden said. \u201cI\u2019m also optimistic that a path exists for Republicans to recapture a majority in the House, and that I could return for two more years as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. But I also know that for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities.\u201d\n\nDuring his tenure in the House, Walden served two terms as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, for the 2014 and 2016 election cycles. Republicans maintained control of the House in both election years.\n\nAs chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over health care issues in the House, Walden played a key role in the GOP's efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare in 2017.\n\nHe led a 27-hour markup of a bill that would repeal and replace ObamaCare, and the measure was passed the GOP-controlled House but went nowhere in the Senate. Congress failed to repeal the 2010 health care law, marking a bitter defeat for Walden and the party.\n\nFurther legislative efforts to attack ObamaCare were sidelined after Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms and Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneTrump health chief declines to detail ObamaCare replacement plan Private equity-funded doctors coalition spends million lobbying on 'surprise' medical billing Lawmakers set to host fundraisers focused on Nats' World Series trip MORE (D-N.J.) took the reins of the committee.\n\nWalden was also instrumental in last year's passage of bipartisan legislation aimed at combatting the opioid epidemic.\n\nSome have speculated Walden could succeed Gordon Smith as head of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). The group has denied there are any plans for Smith to step down.\n\n\u201cGreg\u2019s career has been defined by success \u2014 as a committed local broadcaster, as a bipartisan political bridge builder, and as a brilliant legislator,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cCongress is a better place because of Greg Walden, and I\u2019m certain he will make a positive difference in whatever path his future may hold.\u201d\n\nScott Wong and Jessie Hellman contributed.\n\nUpdated at 2:22 p.m.", "description": "Rep.
