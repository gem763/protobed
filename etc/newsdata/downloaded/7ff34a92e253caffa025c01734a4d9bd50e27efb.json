But things seem to be heating up (or cooling down?) between the singer and The Hills' Kaitlynn Carter.\n\nCyrus and Carter sparked romance rumors shortly after the pop star's breakup news, as photos surfaced showing the two locking lips in Italy. Since then, they've been seen out together from L.A. to NYC, but they haven't publicly confirmed their relationship status just yet.\n\nHere's what we know about Cyrus and Carter's speculated romance so far.\n\nEarly August: They separate from their husbands.\n\nBefore Cyrus and Carter ignited dating rumors during their joint Italian vacay, they both announced their separations from their husbands. Carter and Jenner went public with their split on August 2 after a year of marriage and about four years of dating. (They wed in Indonesia in 2018 but reportedly never got a legal marriage license.)\n\nCyrus and Hemsworth broke news of their separation on August 10 after almost eight months of marriage and 10 years together. A rep for the singer said, \"Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what's best while they both focus on themselves and careers. They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart.\"\n\nCyrus, Hemsworth, Carter, and Jenner were all friends before their respective breakups, according to Entertainment Tonight. \"The four of them have spent time together in Malibu. Brody and Liam are both into surfing and are friends,\" a source told the site.\n\nAugust 10, 2019: The kissing photos surface.\n\nCyrus and Carter were photographed kissing on August 9 during their vacation in Lake Como, and photos hit the press the next day. The two were seen cozying up by the pool at the Il Sereno Hotel, wearing bikinis, and packing on the PDA under the sun. A source told Entertainment Tonight at the time that Cyrus and Carter were \"not trying to hide\" their shows of affection.\n\nFollowing the viral PDA, sources told People and Entertainment Tonight that Carter and Cyrus's relationship wasn't romantic; they're \"just having fun.\"\n\nAn insider also told Page Six that Jenner is \"still friends\" with Cyrus and Carter, and that there was \"no drama\" between them. Jenner's friend and Hills costar Brandon Lee, on the other hand, thought Miley and Kaitlynn were just \"messing with their two ex-husbands\" with their PDA.\n\nAugust 2019: The girls trip continues.\n\nAfter the make-out photos made news, Cyrus and Carter continued to spend time abroad, romping around Italy with friends on an Instagrammable vacation. They posted photos of boat rides, hikes, and downtime together, often with the singer's sister Brandi Cyrus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 14, 2019: They\u2019re back in California together.\n\nAfter their Italian vacation, Cyrus and Carter were seen together again in L.A. There was no PDA this time around; they were in a car together with Cyrus driving and Carter in the passenger seat, according to photos shared by Entertainment Tonight.\n\nAugust 26, 2019: They hold hands at the VMAs after-party.\n\nAfter Cyrus performed her heartbreaking breakup song about her split with Liam Hemsworth at the 2019 MTV VMAs, she headed to the after-party hand in hand with Carter. Carter was also seen walking with Cyrus backstage during the show.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Robert Kamau - Getty Images More", "description": "She apparently wasn't looking for a serious relationship with Kaitlynn Carter.", "authors": ["Chelsey Sanchez", "Erica Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w06up_gbL7fOFOF21K2kmw--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/cd1444ef73d46fe0fc26b0987c69952f", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
