Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar.\n\nThe suspects were being interrogated in a police gymnasium because of their large numbers.\n\nPictures of the raid provided by the Immigration Bureau showed the foreign workers, who included women, either standing up or seating in front of computer monitors with their hands clasped behind their heads in the company\u2019s office.\n\nSimilar recent mass arrests indicate criminal syndicates involved in fraud and illegal online gambling may be trying to move their operations to the Philippines, Bureau of Immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval said. She said that immigration authorities and other law enforcers \u201chave been working triple hard on ridding the country of these illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s arrests bring the number of arrested foreign workers to nearly 1,500, causing overcrowding at the Bureau of Immigration\u2019s detention center, which could only accommodate 140 detainees. Immigration officials plan to relocate detainees to a larger detention center and have tried to improve conditions in the current jail.\n\nMorente said those arrested faced deportation if they violated immigration laws but would have to be detained longer in the Philippines if they\u2019re convicted of crimes.\n\nLast month, immigration authorities, backed by army troops, arrested 324 Chinese accused of involvement in illegal online gambling and other crimes in a raid on eight hotels and other establishments in western Palawan province. Many of the Chinese lacked work permits and passports, officials said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Philippine police and immigration authorities said they have arrested more than 500 illegally working foreigners, mostly Chinese involved in telecommunications and investment scams, in one of the biggest such mass arrests this year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
