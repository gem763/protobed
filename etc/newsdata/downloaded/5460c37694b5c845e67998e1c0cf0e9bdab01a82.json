Kamala Harris (D-CA) said.\n\n\u201cThey knew what they were doing,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

In 2017, nearly 49,000 people died from opioid-related overdoses, with synthetic opioid fentanyl being the biggest driver, and deaths that involved prescription opioids that year were five times higher than in 1999.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) settled two opioid lawsuits last week in Ohio, the site of the latest debate. It agreed to pay $10 million to Cuyahoga and Summit counties in order to avoid a federal trial. This came after J&J was ordered to pay $572 million to the state of Oklahoma in a landmark ruling, in which the judge agreed that the company deceptively marketed painkillers. Other companies that have reached opioid settlements include Allergan (AGN), Purdue Pharma, and Insys Therapeutics.\n\nHarris wasn\u2019t the only one to single out drug manufacturers for their role in the overdose crisis. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) also spoke candidly about it.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gotten worse and worse. And we now know why.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said, \u2018Keep pumping them out. They\u2019re eating them like Doritos,\u2019\u201d she said, referring to opioid manufacturer Mallinckrodt.\n\nKlobuchar stated that the people who should pay for opioid treatment \u201care the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place,\u201d which she said are the manufacturers of the drugs. She would do this by imposing a $0.02-per-milligram tax, along with the federal master settlement (a global settlement that would pay billions of dollars to those affected by opioids), and use the money to help rural and urban areas overwhelmed by addiction.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also chimed in on the topic, connecting it back to how major executives make millions of dollars in profits.\n\n\u201cIn this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit.\u201d", "description": "Democratic candidates like Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar criticized big pharma companies for their role in the opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q.cDCSir111DRVCJoi872g--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9d0736f0-f026-11e9-a89b-30ed92fc03e6", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
