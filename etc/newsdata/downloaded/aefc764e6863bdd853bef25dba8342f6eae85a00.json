The president and his lawyers have taken control of the scorched-earth impeachment fight as advisers, White House staff and outside allies keep offering advice to fight Democrats and stonewall their investigation. Like Mulvaney, many of the aides know it\u2019s best to follow the president\u2019s lead in these high-risk situations.\n\n\u201cThe central question here is: Where is Mick Mulvaney?\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.\u201d \u201cHe's abdicated the most important duty as White House chief of staff, and that is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear. And the most dramatic result of his \u2018Let Trump be Trump\u2019 posture is the Ukraine scandal. He should have thrown his body in front of that phone call.\u201c\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/0d/b3/08dda1db44dc8b035fc7a44ad869/impeachment-evolution2.png\"\n\nSeveral current and former White House aides insist Mulvaney\u2019s job is safe, partly because the president would not be able to find anyone to assume the chief of staff duties amid impeachment proceedings and partly because Mulvaney is too enmeshed in the Ukraine scandal to end up unceremoniously dumped by Trump.\n\nThe president is deeply frustrated with the media coverage and pace of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, but that irritation extends to many corners of the West Wing, said 16 current and former senior administration officials and allies to both Trump and Mulvaney, who were granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal reactions to the looming impeachment threat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to discern any impeachment strategy whatsoever, so it makes it really hard to judge what Mulvaney is or isn\u2019t doing,\u201d Whipple said. \u201cPodesta was extremely effective during President [Bill] Clinton's impeachment \u2014 he called himself the \u2018secretary of shit.\u2018 [H.R.] Haldeman, not so much. So Mulvaney\u2018s somewhere in that spectrum, but he\u2018s a lot closer to Haldeman than he is to Podesta.\u201c Haldeman was President Richard Nixon's chief of staff during Watergate.\n\nTwo senior administration officials insisted Mulvaney\u2019s standing inside the White House is fine. Still, the president\u2019s tendency to change his mind rapidly and unpredictably has created an atmosphere of uncertainty for nearly everyone around him \u2014 including Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cThis is the point in Trumpworld where they figure out who to blame,\u201d a second former administration official said.\n\nA spokesman for Mulvaney did not comment, while the White House press office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMulvaney allies said the acting chief is content to maintain a low profile and help the president as the Democratic proceedings unfold, but they said he would be ready to make a graceful exit if he senses Trump is preparing to make him a scapegoat or if the chaos inside the White House becomes unsustainable. One former Trump aide recalled his time in the administration this way: \u201cYou learn how to walk and chew gum even when stuff is blowing up around you, but eventually it becomes too much for everyone.\u201d\n\nAnother former White House official said \u201cMick, in general, is someone who likes to keep his options open,\u201d noting Mulvaney made a play to become president of the University of South Carolina weeks before he decided to remain inside the administration. He similarly was eyeing both the chief of staff job and the secretary of Commerce slot when he was actively leading the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\u201cI don't think he\u2018s ever viewed this role as something he would do forever,\u201d one Mulvaney ally said about his stint as acting chief of staff. \u201cIf his plan was to stay for a very long time, he would have pushed for a title change. If he got a real sense that the president wants somebody else, he\u2018s not going to fight that. He is in good standing with Trump right now, but this is a hard time for anybody. So, it wouldn\u2018t shock me if he\u2018s thinking about what he wants to do next.\u201c\n\nPart of the problem for Mulvaney is the competition he finds himself in with colleagues and outside allies who have the president\u2019s ear and are trying to steer him toward particular impeachment strategies. One of those figures \u2014 Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2014 has himself become a central part of the impeachment probe after encouraging the president for months to focus on a conspiracy theory surrounding the overseas business dealings of Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2018s son.\n\n\u201cWith Rudy there, how can Mulvaney be viewed as a wartime consigliere?\u201d - A Republican close to the White House.\n\nThe uncontrollable former New York mayor has been a ubiquitous presence on Fox News since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) formally endorsed an impeachment inquiry \u2014 his appearances often filled with baseless claims about the Bidens and legal threats against Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWith Rudy there, how can Mulvaney be viewed as a wartime consigliere?\u201d a Republican close to the White House said.\n\nThe person added that White House senior adviser Jared Kushner has also sought to guide his father-in-law\u2019s response to impeachment. Kushner, who was against setting up an internal war room, has encouraged the White House to outsource as much of its political response as possible to the president\u2018s reelection campaign, according to two sources familiar with internal deliberations, one of whom said Mulvaney and Kushner have been \u201cworking together for the most part, but don\u2019t always see eye to eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cJared is as tough as they come \u2026 and I just don\u2019t know whether Mulvaney is on that level. Does he take prisoners?\u201d the Republican close to the White House said.\n\nAs Mulvaney and his White House colleagues have deliberated the best counter-impeachment strategy for Trump to follow, the president has pursued a go-it-alone approach that raises questions about the futility of their efforts. Pleas for Trump to focus on policy matters and cut Giuliani out of his orbit have fallen on deaf ears, according to one congressional GOP aide. Instead, the president has unleashed rapid-fire attacks against his political opponents \u2014 including Sen. Mitt Romney, who Trump called a \u201cpompous 'ass'\u201d after the Utah Republican described his overtures to Ukraine and China as \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s belief that he is his own best messenger has also led to his indefinite suspension of the daily White House briefing \u2014 a controlled environment that would allow his press secretary to choose which impeachment-related questions to respond to, as opposed to conducting damage control each time the president engages in meandering predeparture Q&A sessions on the White House South Lawn.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons those close to Mulvaney said his decision to remain out of sight has less to do with any hesitancy to defend the president and more to do with what Trump himself desires from his top aide.\n\n\u201cClearly the president wants to be the messenger here. What difference does it make to have the chief of staff on TV?\u201d the Mulvaney ally said.\n\nBut others said speculation about Mulvaney\u2019s role in the impeachment fightback is itself an indication that he has lost clout with the president and that he might only be telling Trump what he wants to hear to preserve his status while he plots an exit.\n\n\u201cThe frustration I\u2019ve heard is that they\u2019re not really set up to fight this impeachment battle and he would normally be the one spearheading that effort on the inside since he\u2019s chief of staff,\u201d one of the former White House officials said.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "A Republican Close To The White House."], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/35/f4/547c56be4847b3257296cce7442c/191008-mulvaney-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
