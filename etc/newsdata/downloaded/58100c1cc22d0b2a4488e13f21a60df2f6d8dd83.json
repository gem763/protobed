NMBA is a \"potential human carcinogen,\" the FDA says.\n\nThe recall comes amid a larger string of recalls of blood pressure medications valsartan, losartan and irbesartan that contain trace levels of carcinogens NMBA, N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), the FDA says.\n\nTo check to see if your medication has been affected, click here\n\nHundreds of lots of the medication have been recalled since last July.\n\nThe drugs, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), work by widening or relaxing blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure. However, not all ARBs have been affected, and patients should continue to use their medication, the FDA says.\n\nHeartburn drugs: FDA finds probable carcinogen in Zantac and other heartburn drugs\n\n\"The risk of harm to the patient's health may be higher if the treatment is stopped immediately without any alternative treatment,\" federal health officials wrote in a statement.\n\nThe FDA has said the contaminants likely resulted from a manufacturing change adopted by factories in China and India that make the drug ingredients. The manufacturing change may generate the contaminants \"when specific chemicals and reaction conditions are present\" and can result of reusing materials such as solvents.\n\nIn January, the agency admitted that some versions of the drug valsartan contained trace amounts of a carcinogen for four years before regulators detected the impurity last summer.\n\nNew generic: FDA approves new valsartan generic to counter shortages of the blood pressure drug\n\nHowever, FDA officials said the cancer risk for any person who took valsartan that had the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA, is small. FDA scientists concluded there would be one more cancer case above average rates for every 8,000 people on the highest dose of valsartan for four years.\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker.
