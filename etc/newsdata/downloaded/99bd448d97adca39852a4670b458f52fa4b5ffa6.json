The program will give you automatic cash back at certain retailers if you pay with the Venmo card.\n\nVenmo says that the Venmo card will initially earn you 5 percent cash back at Target, Sephora, and Wendy\u2019s, and 4 percent cash back at Dunkin\u2019. However, these are \u201climited-time offers\u201d \u2014 though Venmo tells us that new offers will be added on an ongoing basis (and you can see where there are deals by using the app). But if you don\u2019t buy from one of the places where there\u2019s an offer, you won\u2019t get cash back.\n\nAccording to Venmo, any cash back will be deposited straight into your Venmo account, and from there, the money can be used to pay friends in the app, buy things using the card, or pay merchants that take Venmo. You can also just deposit the cash back at your bank, if you\u2019d prefer.\n\nVenmo\u2019s card might seem like a good deal, particularly since you don\u2019t have to sign up for a credit card, but there are plenty of other cards that give you cash back all the time in addition to big bonuses at specific stores. An Amazon Prime Rewards card offers 5 percent cash back on all Amazon purchases, for instance, 2 percent at restaurants and gas stations, as well as 1 percent on everything else you buy. The Apple Card offers up to 3 percent cash back, and Discover has a one percent cash back checking account.\n\nAnd some stores have branded debit cards with rewards you might prefer to cash. Target\u2019s RedCard, for example, offers an immediate five percent discount on everything you buy at Target.", "description": "Venmo announced today that it\u2019s launching Venmo Rewards, a rewards program for its physical Venmo debit card.
