Yandhi, which was also announced by Kim Kardashian on Twitter, was expected to be released last September. It was then pushed back to a 23 November release date, but never arrived.\n\nWest eventually addressed the situation by tweeting: \u201cI realise the new album I\u2019ve been working on isn\u2019t ready yet. I\u2019ll announce the release date once it\u2019s done. Thank you for understanding.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the decision to delay Jesus Is King coincided with a meeting West had with executives from his label, Def Jam, in Wyoming.\n\nWest, who recently purchased a ranch in the sparesly populated state, held one of his signature services there last weekend.", "description": "Disappointed Kanye West fans are reacting after the rapper failed to release his album on the scheduled\u00a0date.
