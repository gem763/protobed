Bengali actors Mimi Chakraborty and Nusrat Jahan were elected as Trinamool Congress MPs from West Bengal. Chakraborty posted pictures of their first day at the Parliament.\n\nHowever, people on Twitter were not really happy about them posing in front of the Parliament. Both the actresses were shamed for how they dressed up on their first day. Earlier, after their names were announced as Trinamool candidates, both of them faced trolling.\n\nChakraborty posted a picture wearing a white shirt, jeans and a pair of sneakers. Nusrat too shared the similar picture on her Instagram account standing in front of the Parliament and had to face the same thing as Chakraborty.\n\nAnd its us again\n\n1st day at Parliament @nusratchirps pic.twitter.com/ohBalZTJCV \u2014 Mimssi (@mimichakraborty) May 27, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 797 SHARES 2.8 K SHARES 512 SHARES 20 K SHARES 14.3 K SHARES\n\nNot just their dressing sense, people also commented on Nusrat\u2019s grammatical mistake in her caption.\n\n1.\n\nWhat are your plans??

Even in 2019, we are judging women for their choice of what they want to wear or how they want to look, and that is worrying. If and when they deserve to be criticised for not doing their jobs, they should get their fair share of telling off, but trolling them for their attire is not okay.", "description": "Trinamool Congress offered 17 of its seats to women this year.
