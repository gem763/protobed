But Europe is far from ready to let its top digital enforcer go down in flames.\n\nIn a landmark decision, the EU's General Court on Tuesday shot down one of the Danish politician's most high-profile cases \u2014 charges against Starbucks that it had evaded up to \u20ac30 million in unpaid taxes in the Netherlands.\n\nThe judges ruled that the European Commission had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that the coffee chain had fallen afoul of European rules against state aid via preferential tax treatments.\n\nThe move carried plenty of sting. It hinted at potential trouble for the Commission in a similar decision over whether to uphold the competition commissioner's \u20ac13 billion tax ruling against Apple and the Irish government that is expected next year.\n\nThe Apple appeal, if it goes against Vestager, could bring a major part of her legacy crashing down, damaging her reputation and raising questions about whether she\u2019s the right person to lead Europe\u2019s digital industrial strategy during the incoming Commission.\n\n\"The Commission will continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU State aid rules\" \u2014 Margrethe Vestager\n\nBut for now, at least, Vestager\u2019s problems are procedural, rather than political.\n\nDespite Tuesday\u2019s Starbucks tax setback, the Danish politician retains her aura in Europe \u2014 and elsewhere \u2014 as the politician who went up against American juggernauts from Google to Facebook and brought them to heel with a combination of monster fines and a take-no-prisoners attitude.\n\nThe competition commissioner remains immensely popular, with a profile that overshadows all other members of the incoming European Commission, including its president, former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nThis week\u2019s ruling in Luxembourg, which undoes one of her landmark cases, is unlikely to change that dynamic, especially as Vestager prepares to step into what is arguably the most powerful role of her career: the European Commission\u2019s executive vice president for digital.\n\nIn that role, Vestager will not only retain authority over antitrust enforcement, but also will be in charge of defining how technologies like artificial intelligence should be governed and how the bloc could potentially block foreign acquisitions in strategic sectors, particularly related to Europe\u2019s tech sector.\n\nIt\u2019s Vestager\u2019s next big job that will garner the attention of European lawmakers in coming weeks \u2014 not her success rate at the EU General Court. A confirmation hearing in European Parliament on October 8 should offer a sense of Vestager\u2019s status in the eyes of EU peers. Expect softball questions \u2014 not takedowns.\n\nReacting to the Starbucks news on Tuesday, the Danish politician showed little sign of being cowed.\n\n\"Today's judgments give important guidance on the application of EU state aid rules in the area of taxation,\u201d she said in a statement. \"The Commission will continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU State aid rules.\"\n\nVestager\u2019s smooth ride in public opinion is likely to continue until the new Commission takes office in November.\n\nBut in the ensuing months, a series of traps threaten to snare some of Vestager\u2019s biggest achievements from her previous mandate, from a possible reversal of the Apple case to a series of appeals against the combined \u20ac8 billion in antitrust fines she has inflicted on Google in three investigations.\n\nIf her legacy starts to come undone, Vestager\u2019s influence will wane where she needs it most \u2014 in the hallways of the European Commission and in national capitals, convincing other ambitious regulators to follow her lead in joining the dots between disparate strands of tech regulation that range from antitrust enforcement to data protection.\n\nThat, in turn, could threaten the stated ambition of the incoming geopolitical Commission, which is to elevate the European Union\u2019s so-called digital sovereignty \u2014 or its ability to impose its own rules on the internet economy and promote new European tech champions.\n\nTo stay ahead, the Danish politician may have to abandon previous heavy-handed tactics and come up with new legislative ways of reining in Big Tech, often in conjunction with politicians who may not see eye to eye with her tactics.\n\nAfter Tuesday's Starbucks tax setback, Vestager is under more pressure than ever to deliver.\n\nDon\u2019t expect that to ease when she starts work in November.", "description": "Margrethe Vestager has a public mandate to regulate Big Tech, regardless of court reversals.", "authors": ["Mark Scott", "Simon Van Dorpe"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55226915-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
