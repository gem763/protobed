So dust off your pom-poms and practice your best spirit fingers.\n\nBring It On is a cinematic masterpiece. The film taught us about cheerocracies, the difference between spirit fingers and jazz hands, and a whole bunch of cheers that are stuck in my head to this day. It had boys, bitchiness and the beloved Spirit Stick. Honestly, what more could you need? Twenty years later, I\u2019m still obsessed, and apparently Kirsten Dunst is too.\n\nAfter a recent accidental reuniting with co-star Gabrielle Union for a Rodarte Campaign, Dunst has been hit with Bring It On related questions. During a recent episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, she was asked whether she\u2019d be interested in a reunion, ET reports.\n\n\u201cIf they wanted to make another movie, I would make another movie. It would be so fun!\u201d Dunst told Kelly Clarkson.\n\nYou heard the woman! Make it happen, Universal.\n\nIn the interview, she went on to discuss how it\u2019d be different this time around, likely because the OG film had a minuscule budget and wasn\u2019t expected to be the cult-classic it has now become.\n\n\u201cWe made that movie for no money, zero money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a Universal movie but one of those where they\u2019re just like, \u2018Go do what you want.\u2019 \u2026 That\u2019s always the best when you don\u2019t expect anything and then [it] became so huge.\u201d\n\nAnd Dunst isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s keen on a new film. Director Peyton Reed has also discussed a reunion in an ET interview in 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve actually talked about \u2014 and I\u2019ve talked about it with the actors and [writer] Jessica Bendinger,\u201d he shared. \u201cCould you do like, a 20-year later thing to just pick up where they are now, make it this generational thing? It\u2019s something we\u2019ve kind of talked about over the years but never quite honed in on it.\u201d\n\nEssentially, the idea would involve the OG characters in their adult lives, including \u201cweird mid-life crises\u201d and adult problems.\n\nReunions and reboots are inevitable. Everything from Gilmore Girls to Gossip Girl has been rebooted in recent years, so it would really be no surprise if Bring It On copped one too.\n\nAlthough it wouldn\u2019t be the first sequel (or the 2nd, 3rd or 4th), this hypothetical film would be the first time Kirsten Dunst and Gabrielle Union revisited the franchise since the OG in 2000.\n\nObviously, Kirsten Dunst can\u2019t just shake her spirit fingers and make it happen, but hopefully this reminds Universal that they\u2019re sitting on a fucking GOLD MINE and should absolutely revisit the Bring It On franchise.", "description": "Kirsten Dunst has told Kelly Clarkson in an interview that she would be interested in doing a reboot of the 2000s classic 'Bring It On'", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/bring-it-on2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
