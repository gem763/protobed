He hopes diplomacy can shed light on the fate of eight Japanese citizens still missing\n\nIt was supposed to have been a quiet date on the beach for two young people with plans to spend the rest of their lives together.\n\nIn late July 1978, Kaoru Hasuike and his girlfriend, Yukiko Okudo, walked several hundred metres along the sand, making sure to avoid a group of rowdy drinkers. After finding a quiet spot, they sat side by side to watch the sun set over the Sea of Japan.\n\nHasuike, then a 20-year-old law student, lit a cigarette as he and Okuda, a company employee two years his senior, chatted and admired the view.\n\nRelatives of Japanese abducted by North Korea decades ago place hope in Trump Read more\n\nSeconds later, a man approached from behind and asked, in accented Japanese, to borrow his lighter. Two other men appeared, restraining Okudo and punching Hasuike after he resisted. As soon as the coastline was in darkness, the couple were bundled on to a small boat and taken to a fishing trawler moored offshore.\n\n\u201cAt first I thought that my girlfriend was going to be raped and that I would be killed,\u201d Hasuike says, standing close to the spot where their ordeal began 41 years ago. \u201cI was paralysed with fear.\u201d\n\nHasuike and Okudo were injected with a sedative, placed inside sleeping bags and kept in the boat\u2019s hold. Two days later, they arrived in North Korea, the victims of the communist regime\u2019s ambitious plans to create a cold war network of spies that would operate in Japan, its hated former colonial ruler.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kaoru Hasuike, 45, left, and his wife Yukiko Okudo, 46, in 2002 after being returned to Japan after 24 years in North Korea, where they were abducted to in 1978.

Yokota, they claimed, had killed herself in a psychiatric hospital in the early 1990s.\n\nBut Japan\u2019s government and the victims\u2019 families refuse to believe that they are dead, citing forged death certificates and sightings of victims after they had supposedly died. DNA tests on remains North Korea claimed were those of Yokota were found to belong to people unrelated to the abductions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shigeo Iizuka with a photograph of his younger sister, Yaeko Taguchi, who was abducted from Japan by North Korean spies in 1978.

I won\u2019t stop until she is back. I would welcome her home, but the first words I would say to her are \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.\u201d\n\nTrump has reportedly raised the abductions in two of his three meetings with Kim. Hasuike, though, believes a breakthrough will come only after the leaders have made substantial progress on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, paving the way for a meeting between Kim and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe.\n\nAbe, a hardliner on North Korea, insists that normalising diplomatic ties and providing Japanese aid are contingent on a resolution of the abduction issue.\n\nAfter his arrival in North Korea, Hasuike, an associate professor of Korean language and culture at Niigata Sangyo University, was initially trained to become an agent, undergoing daily instruction in the Korean language and the regime\u2019s ideology. His apprenticeship ended when two women abducted from Lebanon who had been trained as agents escaped while on assignment in Yugoslavia, prompting the regime to concede that its plan to build a global network of spies carried too many risks.\n\nHasuike was then enlisted to teach Japanese to spies, but that programme ended when a suspect in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner revealed she had been taught Japanese by a woman thought to be an abducted Japanese citizen, Yaeko Taguchi. The truth of the regime\u2019s abductions was out.\n\nHasuike spent his final years in North Korea translating articles from Japanese newspapers and magazines. He and Yukiko, who now works at a kindergarten, had a son and a daughter in North Korea. Now in their 30s, their children joined them in Japan in 2004 and have \u201ccome to terms\u201d with their parents\u2019 past, he says.\n\nIntense media and public interest in the abductions mean Hasuike will inevitably make more visits to the beach where his life was turned upside down on a warm summer\u2019s evening four decades ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like coming back here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I feel that I have to. Even now, after all this time, it\u2019s important for people to know what happened. And I\u2019m one of the few people who can tell the truth about North Korea\u2019s crimes.\u201d", "description": "Kaoru Hasuike spent 24 years in the north before he was released.
