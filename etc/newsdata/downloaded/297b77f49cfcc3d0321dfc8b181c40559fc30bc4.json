An exhausted-looking Jill Duggar appeared to be at the end of her rope when she posted a series of photos and videos on Instagram on Thursday\n\nHands full: She and her husband Derick Dillard have two children, a four-year-old named Israel and a two-year-old named Samuel\n\nStruggling: Jill, 28, looked exhausted, frustrated, and sad as she detailed her stressful day with her sons\n\n'This is life with just two kids,' the stay-at-home mom said into the camera\n\nHer admission that just two children are pushing her to her limit may be an indication that she and her husband, 30-year-old Derick Dillard, are pulling the breaks on growing their family too much bigger.\n\nIt also seems increasingly unlikely that Jill will have anywhere near as many babies as her mother, who pushed out 19 (with two sets of twins).\n\nJill kicked off her Instagram Stories session on Thursday with a black-and-white photo of herself looking absolutely miserable.\n\nNext, she shared a picture of two-year-old Samuel, her youngest son with Derick. The couple also have a four-year-old son named Israel.\n\n'This was last night... after we put the kids to bed,' she explained.\n\nBut Samuel was definitely not in bed. Instead, he appeared to be putting on a hyper display of theatrics in the kitchen, and had poured chocolate syrup all over a chair, the counter, and the floor.\n\nLittle devil: On Wednesday, Samuel got out of bed and poured chocolate syrup all over the kitchen\n\nLaughing through the pain? Jill added laughing emojis and 'lols' to lighten the mood even though her words betrayed actual distress\n\nSo sad: She looked both exhausted and incredibly unhappy in videos she posted while home cleaning up after her sons\n\nWHAT IS DEPRESSION? While it is normal to feel down from time to time, people with depression may feel persistently unhappy for weeks or months on end. Depression can affect anyone at any age and is fairly common \u2013 approximately one in ten people are likely to experience it at some point in their life. Depression is a genuine health condition which people cannot just ignore or 'snap out of it'. Symptoms and effects vary, but can include constantly feeling upset or hopeless, or losing interest in things you used to enjoy. It can also cause physical symptoms such as problems sleeping, tiredness, having a low appetite or sex drive, and even feeling physical pain. In extreme cases it can lead to suicidal thoughts. Traumatic events can trigger it, and people with a family history may be more at risk. It is important to see a doctor if you think you or someone you know has depression, as it can be managed with lifestyle changes, therapy or medication.

Last night he had chocolate shell all over the kitchen,' she said.\n\n'Now he's screaming at me 'cause he wants a game,' she went on, panning the camera to the little boy throwing a tantrum behind her.\n\n'I just told them to go and lie down or go outside until mommy can cool down and handle this situation,' she said.\n\nAs Sam keeps screaming, Jill shows how she is using an eraser to get the pencil off the wall, explaining that she will them have to vacuum the eraser dust from the carpet.\n\n'This is life with just two kids,' she says, clearly struggling and looking like she'd rather be anywhere else.\n\nStill, Jill was brought up in a household where kids were taught to be content and girls in particular were taught to stay 'sweet,' so after her venting session, she shared a message about positivity.\n\nWhere's grandma? Though some parents enlist the help of their own mothers with young kids, Jill's mom Michelle has young children of her own\n\nConstant cleaning: She managed to clean off most of the pencil marks with an eraser, but then had to vacuum the eraser pieces\n\nMore mess! Later, Jill had to clean up even more spills in the kitchen\n\n'Tryin'a count blessings and looking forward to getting energy out at the pool and then bedtime lol,' she wrote later\n\nDoing his part? Jill concluded by thanking friends for letting her vent to them, and thanking Derick 'for praying'\n\n'Tryin'a count blessings and looking forward to getting energy out at the pool and then bedtime lol,' she wrote with the hashtags #choosejoy and #keepmarching.\n\nShe also thanked two of her friends for letting her vent and her husband 'for praying.'\n\nDerick, a full-time law student, doesn't appear to have offered any other assistance.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Jill has shared candid posts about the struggles of motherhood, though her latest videos are certainly the bleakest look.\n\nIn September, after she complained about a rough day, a friend dropped off coffee and Tootsie Rolls to cheer her up.\n\n'My kids are awesome, but parenting is no joke... and sometimes I think they like to make it a little hard on us,' she wrote.\n\n'I bumped into a friend this morning and told her it was \"one of those days.\" A little while after I got home I got a text from her telling me to check my front door... and when I did I found this.'\n\nRough: In September, Jill said she was having a hard day with her kids when a friend surprised her with coffee and Tootsie Rolls\n\nSo thankful: She gratefully posted a picture of the treat on Instagram\n\nThe little things: She wrote that her kids are 'awesome,' but parenting is 'no joke'\n\nJill's honesty about struggling to raise children has been refreshing for some fans who are used to moms painting a flawless picture on social media.\n\nBring on the condoms! Derick said in August that it was a misconception that they don't believe in birth control\n\nBut it's also one of several hints that Jill and Derick's family may turn out looking more like the average, with just a few kids instead of two baseball teams' worth.\n\nIn fact, they're already breaking from what Jill was raised with by hinting that they use birth control.\n\nIn August, Derick shared his marriage tips, which included having sex at least five to six times a week \u2014 another reason his wife Jill might be so tired.\n\nThat prompted one commenter to ask how they could possibly be doing it that often \u2014 and not getting pregnant \u2014 when they 'don\u2019t believe in birth control.'\n\n'We never said we don't believe in birth control,' Derick replied, calling it a 'misconception.'\n\n'My parents waited 11 years to start having kids, and there's nothing wrong with that. Each Christian family should follow God's leading for their own family, regarding when and how many kids to have.'\n\nGlove-less love: Jill's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle, have spoken out against birth control\n\nOpen door policy: The two used birth control early in their marriage but Michelle claims she experienced a miscarriage while taking it\n\nHuge: They went on to repeatedly reproduce, having 19 kids in all (The family is pictured in 2002)\n\nIt's worth noting that Derick didn't explicitly say that he and Jill use birth control or family planning of any kind, just that they never said they were against it.\n\nEither way, Jill liked the comment, throwing her approval behind it.\n\nAnd while it's true that they had never said they don't believe in birth control, Jill's parents certainly have.\n\nJim Bob and Michelle have been very outspoken against birth control of all kinds, and it was assumed that their adult children had all followed in their footsteps.\n\nMichelle has claimed she got pregnant while on the Pill, and it resulted in a miscarriage. After that, they decided to leave family planning up to God, having as many children as He saw fit to give them.\n\nBut Jill \u2014 who had two difficult deliveries with four-year-old Israel and two-year-old Samuel \u2014 may not be following that path.\n\nFertile ground! While Jill might be keen to limit how many kids she has, several of her siblings are breeding quickly\n\nBig brood: Josh's wife Anna is expecting child number six with Josh in November\n\nRevealed: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald welcomed their third, a daughter named Ivy, in May\n\nAll pink everything: Lauren Duggar, wife of Josiah, is also pregnant and expecting in November\n\nGirls girls girls! Joe and Kendra have a second child on the way, a little sister for their son\n\nBig news! Jinger and her husband Jeremy Vuolo so far only have one child, a daughter named Felicity\n\nExpanding: John David and his wife Abbie are also expecting their first, who will be born next year\n\nShe gave birth to her youngest in July 2017, and said in an Instagram video uploaded this summer that she is not pregnant again.\n\nSticking to just two kids, or even having just a couple more, will certainly set her apart from many of her siblings, several of whom are well on their way to big broods.\n\nHer oldest brother Josh, 31 \u2014 who molested four of his younger siblings as a teenager and later admitted to adultery \u2014 is already expecting his sixth with wife Anna, 30.\n\nJill's sister Jessa, 26, welcomed her third child in May, while brother Joe, 24, and his wife Kendra, 20, are expecting their second.\n\nSister Joy Anna, 21, and Jinger, 25, each have one child, while brother Josiah, 24, and his wife Lauren, 20, and brother John, 29, and his wife Abbie, 26, are each expecting their first.", "description": "On Thursday, an exhausted-looking Jill, 28, appeared to be at the end of her rope when she posted a series of photos and videos on Instagram.", "authors": ["Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303682-0-image-a-64_1570203309101.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
