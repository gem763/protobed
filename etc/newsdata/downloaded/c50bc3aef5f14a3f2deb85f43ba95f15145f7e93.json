But the True Blue singer was able to charge a more reasonable price because she was playing much larger venues that included arenas and stadiums.\n\nThe Madame X Tour is currently in the middle of its residency in Chicago that goes until October 28.\n\nFrom there, it will move to San Francisco and Las Vegas for three date stints.\n\nThe theaters tour also includes stops in Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, Miami Beach, before heading to Europe for a run of shows in Lisbon, London and Paris.\n\nIntimate setting: In all, the average ticket sold for $306.73, which is a major increase from her career average ticket sale amount of $115.81\n\nWith about 75 shows to go, The Madame X Tour is currently projected to generate between $50 million and $55 million. But that number could soar past the $60 million mark because many of the upcoming theaters are larger than the initial venue in Brooklyn.\n\nMadonna is the second highest-grossing solo artist in the history of Billboard Boxscore behind Bruce Springsteen.\n\nWith more than 300 million records sold worldwide, she's also the best-selling female recording artist of all time by Guinness World Records.", "description": "Madonna's Madame X Tour of theaters raked in nearly $10 million for its opening 16-dates in Brooklyn, according to Billboard Boxscore.", "authors": ["Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/01/20110546-0-image-a-34_1571877267186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
