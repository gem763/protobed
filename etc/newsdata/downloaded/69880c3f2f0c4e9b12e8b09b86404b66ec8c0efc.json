Kavanaugh denied Ramirez\u2019 accusations during his acrimonious Senate confirmation hearing last fall.\n\nThe Times piece also disclosed a previously unreported account that echoes Ramirez\u2019 story. Former Yale classmate Max Stier describes Kavanaugh pushing his private parts into the hand of a female student at a party. The report said the classmate notified U.S. senators and the FBI about the incident, but the FBI did not investigate. The FBI declined to comment on the report.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks next to U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh as they participate in a ceremonial public swearing-in in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 8, 2018.

The Supreme Court press officers did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nKavanaugh, a conservative appointed by Trump, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in October after he denied accusations of sexual assault from three women. The Senate confirmed his appointment to the high court by 50-48 vote, one of the tightest margins ever for a justice.\n\nSome of the Democrats running to replace Trump in 2020 called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment in Twitter posts on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress,\u201d U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders said.\n\n\u201cI sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people,\u201d wrote Senator Kamala Harris, a Judiciary Committee member. \u201cHe must be impeached.\u201d\n\n\u201cConfirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren said in another Twitter post.\n\nFormer Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke joined the chorus on Sunday, as did former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro, who launched the calls for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment on Saturday.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar posted a picture of the woman who testified to the Senate about her allegations against Kavanaugh, Christine Blasey Ford, with the caption, \u201cLet us never forget what courage looks like.\u201d\n\nTrump did not mention the Times article but blamed \u201cradical left Democrats\u201d and the \u201cLameStream Media\u201d for going after Kavanaugh. In a series of Twitter posts, he accused Democrats of threatening impeachment to influence Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions on court cases.\n\n\u201cThey want to scare him into turning Liberal!\u201d he wrote.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump rejected Democrats' calls for impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday after a new report involving sexual misconduct allegations, encouraging Kavanaugh to sue for libel and suggesting the Justice Department could \"rescue\" him.", "authors": ["Doina Chiacu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430186806&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0PC", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
