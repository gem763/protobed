(MOLLY RILEY/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFocus of Durham Probe Shifts to Senior Obama Officials\n\nUS attorney reportedly 'very interested' in interviewing former CIA Director Brennan and former DNI Clapper\n\nJohn Durham, the U.S. attorney tasked with investigating the origins of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign in 2016, is expected to seek an interview with former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, following an expansion of his investigation.\n\nIt was reportedly the meetings that Durham and Attorney General William Barr recently had in Rome\u2014where they obtained new evidence\u2014that were the impetus for the broadening of the scope of the probe.\n\nAccording to Fox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge, her sources told her that Durham is now \u201cvery interested to question\u201d Brennan and Clapper.\n\nAccording to Herridge, the meetings \u201ctook place on Aug. 15 and Sept. 27, 2019, in Rome,\u201d and it was during one or both of these trips that Barr and Durham \u201cgathered new evidence.\u201d\n\nThe news comes following months of speculation about whether the former top Obama officials would be questioned over their involvement in the investigation and spying on the Trump campaign.\n\nIt was recently revealed in a court motion by the lawyer for former national security adviser Michael Flynn that the Justice Department (DOJ) had obtained two cell phones belonging to Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor who has been cited as playing a key role in the FBI\u2019s determination to open its probe of the Trump campaign.\n\nEarlier this month, on Oct. 5, Politico reported that Durham had \u201cnot requested interviews with any of the FBI or DOJ employees who were directly involved in, or knew about, the opening of the Russia investigation in 2016, according to people familiar with the matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to an Oct. 19 New York Times article, Durham has already interviewed \u201cabout two dozen former and current F.B.I. officials\u201d and that the \u201cnumber of interviews shows that Mr. Durham\u2019s review is further along than previously known.\u201d The paper also reported that Durham\u2019s efforts were being aided by \u201ctwo former senior F.B.I. agents\u201d who were assisting with the review.\n\nOne of the former FBI officials assisting Durham\u2019s investigation is reported to be John C. Eckenrode, who, at one time, worked with Patrick J. Fitzgerald in the 2003 Valerie Plame leak case. Eckenrode reportedly knew Durham from his time as an FBI agent in Connecticut, where Durham was a prosecutor. Eckenrode also \u201cran the FBI\u2019s office in Philadelphia\u201d prior to his 2006 retirement from the bureau.\n\nIn addition to the dozens of FBI interviews, Durham\u2019s investigative team has also reportedly \u201cquestioned officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,\u201d although Clapper doesn\u2019t appear to have been among those interviewed. Nor have Durham or his team yet questioned or interviewed CIA personnel.\n\nThe number of interviews conducted as well as the widening scope suggests that Durham has been gathering all available facts, evidence, and data prior to approaching the central figures in his inquiry.\n\nMore recently, on Oct. 19, NBC News reported that Durham \u201chas expressed his intent to interview a number of current and former intelligence officials involved in examining Russia\u2019s effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\u201d\n\nThe outlet also reported that Durham \u201chas also requested to talk to CIA analysts involved in the intelligence assessment of Russia\u2019s activities, prompting some of them to hire lawyers.\u201d\n\nAccording to the article, \u201cJustice Department officials have said that Durham has found something significant, and that critics should be careful.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, NBC News noted that \u201calthough the probe did not begin as a criminal investigation, Justice Department officials won\u2019t comment on whether it has morphed into one.\u201d\n\nBrennan himself also told MSNBC\u2014where he is a paid commentator\u2014earlier this month, that \u201cI\u2019m supposedly going to be interviewed by Mr. Durham as part of this non-investigation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News reported that \u201cbased on what he has been finding, Durham has expanded his investigation\u201d and has gone through the process of \u201cadding agents and resources.\u201d Additionally, Fox reported that the \u201ctimeline has grown from the beginning of the [counterintelligence] probe through the election and now has included a post-election timeline through the spring of 2017, up to when Robert Mueller was named special counsel.\u201d\n\nCIA Involvement\n\nSometime in mid-2016, Brennan formed an interagency task force headquartered at the CIA to investigate foreign intelligence allegations against the Trump campaign. Brennan appeared to describe the task force formation during an Aug. 17, 2018, interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow:\n\nRachel Maddow: \u201cSo, it\u2019s an intelligence-sharing operation between\u2026\u201d\n\nJohn Brennan: \u201cRight. We put together a Fusion Center at CIA that brought [National Security Agency] and FBI officers together with CIA to make sure that those proverbial dots would be connected.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Brennan and some of his CIA analysts, along with Clapper, were responsible for a series of three reports that were used to promote the Trump\u2013Russia collusion story. The first report was released on Oct. 7, 2016, and the second on Dec. 29, 2016.\n\nThe third report, \u201cAssessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections\u201d\u2014also known as the intelligence community assessment (ICA)\u2014was released on Jan. 6, 2017.\n\nThe ICA claimed that \u201cPutin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump\u201d and stated that \u201cPutin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\u201d\n\nThe report played a key role in advancing the now disproven allegation that Trump colluded with Russia.\n\nWhile Brennan denied before Congress that the Steele dossier was used in the ICA, he did attach a two-page summary of the dossier to the ICA that he, along with Clapper and Comey, delivered to then-President Barack Obama on Jan. 6, 2017.\n\nNotably, Adm. Mike Rogers, then head of the National Security Agency, publicly dissented from the findings of the ICA, assigning it only a moderate confidence level, and later told Congress that the report \u201cdidn\u2019t have the same level of sourcing and the same level of multiple sources.\u201d\n\nUse of Unofficial Foreign Intelligence\n\nBrennan also made repeated use of questionable foreign intelligence and passed it along to the FBI.\n\nBrennan testified to Congress in May 2017 that any information, specifically \u201canything involving the individuals involved in the Trump campaign was shared with the bureau [FBI].\u201d Brennan also admitted that it was his intelligence that helped establish the FBI investigation:\n\n\u201cI was aware of intelligence and information about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons that raised concerns in my mind about whether or not those individuals were cooperating with the Russians, either in a witting or unwitting fashion, and it served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [or] cooperation occurred.\u201d\n\nClapper personally confirmed foreign intelligence involvement, during congressional testimony in May 2017:\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.): \u201cOver the spring of 2016, multiple European allies passed on additional information to the United States about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians. Is this accurate?\u201d\n\nClapper: \u201cYes, it is, and it\u2019s also quite sensitive. The specifics are quite sensitive.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a significant problem with Brennan\u2019s ongoing transfer of foreign intelligence leading up to the FBI\u2019s initiation of its counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign on July 31, 2016.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who has seen the electronic communication that was used to officially open the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation, has publicly stated, \u201cWe now know that there was no official intelligence that was used to start this investigation.\u201d\n\nThis view has been backed up by former Rep. Trey Gowdy who, while discussing both Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey, noted: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting if they begin to turn on one another. I\u2019ve seen the document. I\u2019m not going to describe it any more than that. Comey\u2019s got a better argument than Brennan, based on what I have seen.\u201d\n\nUse of Reverse Targeting\n\nIn addition to his use of unofficial foreign intelligence, Brennan appeared to have employed the use of \u201creverse targeting\u201d on members of the Trump campaign. Reverse targeting refers to the targeting of a foreign individual with the intent of capturing data on a U.S. citizen. During the Aug. 17, 2018, interview with MSNBC\u2019s Maddow, Brennan said the following:\n\n\u201cWe call it incidental collection in terms of CIA\u2019s foreign intelligence collection authorities. Any time we would incidentally collect information on a U.S. person, we would hand that over to the FBI because they have the legal authority to do it. We would not pursue that type of investigative, you know, sort of leads. We would give it to the FBI. So, we were picking things up that was of great relevance to the FBI, and we wanted to make sure that they were there\u2014so they could piece it together with whatever they were collecting domestically here.\u201d\n\nHowever, under the laws governing U.S. surveillance, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be protected. Provisions known as minimization procedures are intended to protect information \u201cincidentally collected\u201d on U.S. citizens in the course of foreign surveillance.\n\nMore importantly, the collection described by Brennan doesn\u2019t appear to have been incidental but rather targeted.\n\nAs this foreign intelligence, unofficial in nature and outside of traditional channels, was gathered on members of the Trump campaign, Brennan began his process of feeding this intelligence to the FBI. Repeated transfers of foreign intelligence from the CIA director helped push the FBI toward establishing a formal counterintelligence investigation.\n\nThese actions by Brennan may be precisely why both Barr and Durham are focused on the events leading up to the FBI\u2019s initiation of their investigation into the Trump campaign.\n\nDurham\u2019s investigation is reportedly of a broader scope than the investigation into FISA abuse by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. Barr has said that the Inspector General\u2019s investigation is focused on \u201ca discrete area \u2026 which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at [Trump campaign volunteer] Carter Page\u201d and is limited to officials within the DOJ.\n\nEven so, Durham has reportedly been in contact with Horowitz, whose investigation had \u201cgrown to include more than 2,800 subpoenas, nearly 500 search warrants, 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence and interviews of about 500 witnesses,\u201d according to the Washington Examiner. The IG\u2019s investigative efforts have likely served to assist Durham with the direction and scope of his ongoing investigation.\n\nAs Barr noted during a May 2019 interview with CBS News: \u201cI had a lot of questions about what was going on. I assumed I\u2019d get answers when I went in and I have not gotten answers that are satisfactory, and in fact, probably have more questions, and that some of the facts that I\u2019ve learned don\u2019t hang together with the official explanations of what happened.\u201d", "description": "Focus of Durham Probe Shifts to Senior Obama Officials", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2019/10/23/James-Clapper-John-Brennan-1200x806.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
