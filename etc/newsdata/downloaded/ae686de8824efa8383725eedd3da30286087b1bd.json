On the same day, China started targeting U.S. crude with a 5% tariff being placed on oil imports. Following the escalation, the Crude Oil WTI Futures fell 0.15% to $55.02 by 7:24 AM ET on September 2.\n\n\"Economic uncertainty will continue to dominate the oil market\u2019s agenda as new U.S. and China trade measures come into effect,\" said head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA Harry Tchilinguirian.\n\nWith this in mind, investors have expressed concerns as to whether 3 of the largest players in the space will be able to survive the latest round of tariffs in the ongoing trade war.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look to see if analysts believe these 3 oil giants can emerge from this trade war escalation unscathed.\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX)\n\nWith shares down almost 3% in the month following its August 2 Q2 earnings release, investors are worried that the situation won\u2019t improve thanks to the new tariffs.\n\nHowever, one analyst argues that Chevron\u2019s commitment to improving key areas of its business will keep it on the path towards long-term growth. After hosting investor meetings with CFO Pierre Breber, Cowen & Co. analyst Jason Gabelman believes CVX has made substantial progress in its efforts to improve its return on capital employed (ROCE) with its plan to increase activity in the Permian basin. This is on top of the 5% to 8% year-over-year ROCE improvement it already saw in 2018.\n\nCVX has also taken steps to reduce execution and financial risk by limiting simultaneous major capital projects.\n\nGabelman adds that Chevron\u2019s approach to corporate responsibility makes it an attractive buy. \u201cOn environmental, social and governance (ESG), Mr. Breber highlighted a tension between managing fiduciary duty with societal responsibility. The company will not invest in a business where it does not have a competitive advantage, but understands it needs to be part of the energy future and is taking other steps such as reducing methane emissions,\u201d the analyst explained.\n\nBased on all of the above factors, the analyst reiterated his Buy rating and $140 price target on August 30. Gabelman thinks share prices could surge 19% over the next twelve months.\n\nAll in all, the Street agrees with Gabelman. CVX boasts a \u2018Moderate Buy\u2019 analyst consensus and a $143 average price target, suggesting 21% upside potential.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM)\n\nSince its August 2 Q2 earnings release, Exxon has been faring even worse than Chevron with shares falling about 5% in the last month. In spite of this, a few analysts say this oil stock is worth the risk.\n\nExxon is one of the largest energy companies in the world with a market cap of $290 billion. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that it sports a strong balance sheet, with long-term debt at less than 10% of the capital structure and has a 5% yield which falls at high end of the company's historical range.\n\nThe company has a diverse product pipeline that includes upstream (drilling), midstream (pipeline) and downstream (refining and chemicals). To expand this even more, XOM plans to spend $35 billion per year on various growth projects through 2025.\n\nManagement claims these efforts are already paying off. \u201cWe continue to make significant progress toward delivering our long-term growth plans. Our new U.S. Gulf Coast steam cracker is exceeding design capacity by 10 percent, less than a year after startup,\u201d CEO Darren Woods stated.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The trade war with China is waging on, with the latest escalation coming on September 1 as the U.S. began imposing 15% tariffs on some Chinese goods.
