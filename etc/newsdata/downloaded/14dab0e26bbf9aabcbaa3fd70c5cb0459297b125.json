England drew the second pick ahead of Wales and South Africa, meaning the two teams in Saturday\u2019s semi-final clash in Yokohama were given priority over hotel selection.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

For the players to get from A to B it takes 10 minutes rather than five minutes, so you\u2019ve got to be able to cope with that and find ways to get to your best. It\u2019s a different week and it\u2019s an exciting week.\u201d\n\nJones will at least have a fully fit squad to prepare for the eagerly-anticipated clash with the three-time World Cup champions, with Jack Nowell set to return to full training on Tuesday and Jonny May winning his race to recover from a hamstring injury.\n\n\u201cJonny is bouncing around this morning,\u201d said scrum coach Neal Hatley. \u201cHe has a small twinge and we\u2019ll assess where he is a little bit later today, but he\u2019s in really good spirits, moving well and we also expect Jack to be fit for selection as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic where we are, all 31 being available for selection at the end of the week.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand meanwhile are set to be without back-row forward Matt Todd for the game after he injured the same shoulder that he previously dislocated earlier this year, although there are no fears over fellow flanker Sam Cane after coach Steve Hansen confirmed his early withdrawal at half-time in the win over Ireland was purely tactical.\n\n\"Matty Todd has hurt that shoulder again, so we'll just have to see how he goes,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt's unlikely he'll be available [for the England game] but everyone else is 100 per cent. He dislocated it a wee while ago and got a bang on it yesterday, so we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n\n\"Sam\u2019s fine. We just subbed him at half-time, we wanted to bring Scotty Barrett on, it was a tactical decision. When you've got the bench we've got, the thought behind it is that we can add something different to the game and change the picture a bit. We're happy with the way it went too.\"", "description": "England\u00a0will plot the downfall of reigning world champions New Zealand\u00a0from a Mickey Mouse Hotel after checking into Tokyo\u2019s Disneyland in order to keep distractions to a minimum in semi-final week.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/09/owen-farrell-eddie-jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
