(Lefteris Pitarakis/AP)\n\nIn an erratic attempt to justify his decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria and open the way for a Turkish military incursion, President Trump said recently that Turkey and the Kurds are \u201ca natural enemy\u201d and that \u201cone historian said they\u2019ve been fighting for hundreds of years.\u201d\n\nBoth assertions are dangerously wrong.\n\nAs Turkish tanks roll into Syria to take territory from U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters, I worry about the long-term effect of Trump\u2019s reductionist understanding of our region of the world. I worry about rising nationalism in Turkey. I worry about the further tightening of free speech under our beleaguered democracy. I worry about the increasingly unbridgeable gap between Turkey and the West and how that can impact our lives.\n\nA series of terrible decisions have brought us here.\n\nMonths of negotiations between Turkey and the United States to create a safe zone were going relatively well, with joint Turkish-U.S. patrols and surveillance of the area. An orderly transition was possible. There was no reason to rush to war.\n\nThe Syrian Kurds on our borders who have been fighting the Islamic State alongside the Americans have never directly attacked Turkey. They are our neighbors and relatives. There are millions of Turks like me who do not see Syrian Kurds as a threat but rather as a buffer in a chaotic region. We need to normalize our relations with Syrian Kurds and engage in a political solution to the Kurdish issue, which touches on Iraq, Syria and Turkey \u2014 not sow seeds of hostility for generations to come.\n\nTurks and Kurds have been living together for over a thousand years. We are not natural enemies. Kurds roughly make up a fifth of our population and are our immediate neighbors in Syria and Iraq. They are seamlessly integrated in cities across Turkey, share the same culture and vote for the same political parties. Even though the Turkish government has been fighting the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) for decades, Ankara also engaged in a very detailed peace process with it for limited local autonomy inside Turkey, involving direct negotiations with the PKK and its imprisoned leader Abdullah \u00d6calan. That process, which came to an abrupt end in the summer of 2015, had broad popular support. Even as recently as June, the Turkish government hailed \u00d6calan\u2019s weighing in on the local elections, because it played in Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s favor.\n\nWhy the rush to war now? If Erdogan was promoting \u00d6calan\u2019s position only months ago, if the third-largest party (pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party) in Turkey\u2019s own parliament is sympathetic to \u00d6calan\u2019s cause, if millions tend to vote in the direction of his movement inside Turkey, how hard is it to talk directly with them on the ground in Syria?\n\nThere are several issues with Turkey\u2019s desire to create a safe zone inside Syria. First, it will not make us any safer. Turkey wants to rid the area of armed elements of Syrian Kurdish forces, namely the People\u2019s Protection Units, linked to the PKK, and push the Kurdish forces 15 to 30 kilometers away from the border. But what happens south of that? No matter where you draw the line, we will always share a border with a group of people who define themselves as Kurds and whom Turkey defines as terrorists. Isn\u2019t it better to normalize relations with Syrian Kurds and enhance our security through a Kurdish belt on our borders?\n\nFear is what makes Turkey act. Turkish officials tell me disrupting an autonomous Kurdish zone is an existential necessity for Turkey, and that stems from a fear that Turkey\u2019s own Kurds might want to secede one day. That\u2019s like saying you will never take your husband to a party for fear he will be tempted to cheat. If the foundations of your marriage are so weak, you need to think deeper. I point out to these officials that the heart of the problem is in Turkey \u2014 not Syria. We fear Syria because in parts of Turkey, Kurds have traditionally felt so alienated and repressed that they have rebelled. The way you deal with that rebellion is establishing a real democracy where everyone feels equal and free. That\u2019s the only long-term panacea against the threat of secession.\n\nThat\u2019s more or less what Turkey tried before. And it worked. During the peace process, polls indicated that an overwhelming number of Turkey\u2019s Kurds did not want to live anywhere else but Turkey. They wanted political representation, Kurdish language education and other things that were close to being achieved.\n\nTurkey\u2019s proposal to settle refugees on the safe zone is also problematic. Erdogan wants to build new towns to settle at least one million refugees from Turkey and Idlib. At the United Nations, he showed computer-generated graphics with towns, homes, schools, mosques and gardens. The reality is more complicated: Most of Turkey\u2019s Syrian refugees are not from the safe-zone-designated area and will not move to northern Syria. We also don\u2019t have the resources to build towns and villages. Almost two centuries of demographic engineering failed to address the political demands from restless populations across the Ottoman Empire. His plan is doomed from the start.\n\nThis military operation comes at a time of visible political vulnerability for the Turkish president. His ruling AKP party suffered a massive loss in local elections in June, and efforts are underway to form new splinter parties by former AKP heavyweights like Ahmet Davutoglu and Ali Babacan. Erdogan believes that the refugee population in Turkey \u2014 nearly 4 million inside Turkey and another 4 million on its borders \u2014 is one of the main reasons for AKP\u2019s declining popularity, currently below the 51 percent threshold for him to be elected for president.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the serious issue of our partners against the Syrian Kurds. Turkey has organized an army of Syrian Sunni militias for the fighting and administering of the so-called safe zone. Among them are very unsavory groups with a terrible record of atrocities and radicalism. How is empowering these Islamist militants to displace secular Kurds on our doorstep making Turkey safer?\n\nTrump is wrong on Turks and Kurds. The Turkish government is wrong on the real threats we are facing. Fratricide among Turks and Kurds and a zone of Sunni Islamist militants on our borders will not make us safer.\n\nOnly building and strengthening our democracy to include Kurds will.\n\nRead more:\n\nIlham Ahmed: We fought ISIS side by side with the Americans.
