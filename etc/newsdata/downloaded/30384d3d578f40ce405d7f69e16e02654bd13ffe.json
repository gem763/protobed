He reiterated that earlier this year a bipartisan supermajority of senators supported legislation warning against the early withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nTrump received rare Republican blowback last week when he announced his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, following a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In response, McConnell urged Trump to \u201cexercise American leadership.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally, has introduced a sanctions bill against Turkey with Sen. Chris Van Hollen.\n\nGraham said Sunday that he spoke to Trump, who he said agreed to work with Congress to stop Turkey\u2019s aggression in Syria.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Trump said that he would soon issue an executive order \u201cagainst current and former officials of the Government of Turkey and any persons contributing to Turkey\u2019s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nBut Senate Democrats said that sanctions against Turkey are not enough.\n\n\"Strong sanctions, while good and justified, will not be sufficient in undoing that damage nor will it stop the consequences stemming from the ISIS jailbreak,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), in a joint statement with Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.). \"The first step when Congress returns to session this week is for Republicans to join with us in passing a resolution making clear that both parties are demanding the president\u2019s decision be reversed.\"\n\nThe senators further urged Trump to change course, calling the withdrawal of troops \"a grave mistake worth reversing.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Monday that she was working with Graham on a bipartisan resolution that would overturn Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Following his conversation with Pelosi, Graham tweeted that he would work \"across party lines in a bicameral fashion to draft sanctions and move quickly.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2c/d8/f53ba44345feb6e23f33fe1a9d27/190903-mcconnell-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
