Email tom.davidson@reachplc.com\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n\"It was completely out of the blue.\"\n\nAthletic Maisie was showing off in front of her mum in June when she said she suddenly felt dizzy and her tummy hurt.\n\nShe then spent a week in Southend Hospital but the family didn't receive a diagnosis.\n\nAccording to Mrs Jones the tummy ache was determined as \"chronic constipation\" and the dizziness was unexplained.\n\nHer daughter was sent home and \"could hardly walk\" before she was admitted again.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\nBut in July, Maisie collapsed and was eventually transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital. At her worst, she couldn't move from the neck down.\n\nMrs Jones and her husband Alan, 49, who runs a carpet and blinds shop in Dagenham, were told she had FND.\n\nMrs Jones, who is now a carer for her two youngest children, added: \"She has not been able to walk since.\n\n\"I was completely shocked that it was that and how impacted she is.\n\n\"It is horrible and awful for everybody. Our lives have completely changed.\"\n\nFND often impacts teenage girls and Maisie must now retrain her brain in order to walk again.\n\nShe is being home schooled until she can finally get back on her feet.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\nMaisie has had to move to a downstairs bedroom because she can no longer use the stairs. Her autistic brother, Tommy, five, has also struggled to cope.\n\n\"He doesn't understand why his sister can't play with him anymore,\"\n\nMrs Jones, of Hullbridge, Essex, said. \"Maisie gets upset because she can not get up and run around. She can't go to the park anymore because she gets too upset.\"\n\nShe added: \"My little boy keeps saying when Maisie is better everything will be normal again. We don't know which way to turn.\"\n\nThe family is now raising \"desperately needed\" funds to pay for a private psychologist and therapist and for Maisie to have hydrotherapy treatment.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\nMrs Jones added: \"We just want her better.\n\n\"We are heartbroken seeing her struggle, our lives have changed drastically because of this condition and all we want is for Maisie to walk again.\"\n\nCEO of The Brain Charity, Nanette Mellor, said: \"Functional Neurological Disorder is a much more common condition than many people think and, because it affects the brain, it can affect people in so many different ways.\n\n\"We have supported adults who have lost their jobs and their homes as a result and young people who have been rendered paralysed by it for months at a time.\n\n\"For many people with this condition, their whole lives will turn upside down.\n\n(Image: Triangle News)\n\n\"I think one of the most difficult aspects of having a diagnosis of FND is that really, we still have very little information about the causes of it and this really impedes our ability to find treatment.\n\n\"FND is also known as 'medically unexplained neurological symptoms' so what we are essentially saying is that we don't know what this is yet.\n\n\"The brain is such a complex and mysterious thing and we are only really just beginning to understand how to measure and assess what is going on inside it.\n\n\"So for those with FND, getting a diagnosis and remaining positive about finding treatment that will work for them is a long hard battle.\"\n\nA GoFundMe page has been set up for Maisie.", "description": "Maisie Jones' gymnastics triggered a rare neurological condition that was discovered by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London", "authors": ["Liam Mcinerney", "Image", "Triangle News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550217.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Maise_Jones_Handstand_4_TRIANGLENEWS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
