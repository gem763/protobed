Definitely not all of them.", "language": "en", "text": "Though it\u2019s one of the most beloved slogans in American advertising, \u201cMelts in your mouth, not in your hand\u201d never rang quite true to me. The pleasure of M&M\u2019s comes from their texture when you crunch on them: hard candy shell, soft chocolate mantle, surprise nuts or peanut butter in the core. Who are these weirdos that let M&M\u2019s sit around in their mouth, slowly disintegrating in their saliva, rather than chewing them like an actual adult?\n\n[We tried 13 popular potato chip brands, and our top and bottom picks might just surprise you]\n\nCrunch is essential to an M&M. That\u2019s what we learned in a recent sampling of alternative M&M flavors, which have proliferated faster than Oreos. M&M\u2019s with a surprising center \u2014 nuts, crunchy bits, pretzels, whatever \u2014 were among the better offerings. But the flavors were a mixed bag. Here\u2019s a quick rundown.\n\nHazelnut spread: There\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t call it Nutella here. It\u2019s a poor knockoff of the beloved brand, but the creamy middle is nice.\n\nPretzel: Salty and crunchier than the crispy M&M\u2019s, somehow.\n\nCoffee nut: Maybe you thought there would be an actual coffee bean in this. Sorry to disappoint you, but it\u2019s just coffee flavoring and a peanut. They\u2019re okay, I guess.\n\nCrunchy mint: Would you like to eat Thin Mints in M&M form? I have good news for you.\n\nCrispy: The worst name. The best texture!\n\nMexican jalape\u00f1o peanut: Spicy chocolate can be great. But this one has a sort of grassy, peppery taste \u2014 not like the chili-infused chocolate bars you may have tried before. It\u2019s off-putting.\n\nThai coconut peanut: Challenging! The coconut flavor verges on the edge of overpowering but stops just short of being cloying.\n\nCaramel: Basic! They\u2019re good. They\u2019re fine.\n\nWhite chocolate peanut: The peanut flavor supersedes the white chocolate flavor, which is either good or bad news, depending on your perspective.\n\nEnglish toffee peanut: Why do they taste like sad pancakes? I sincerely want to know.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nAntoni Porowski is more than \u2018Queer Eye\u2019s\u2019 avocado hunk. With his new cookbook, he\u2019s ready to prove it.\n\nNow Popeyes is trolling America by inviting people to make their own chicken sandwiches\n\nWho makes the best cookies-and-cream ice cream in the U.S.? We scooped up 15 top brands to find out.", "description": "Hazelnut spread, jalape\u00f1o peanut and coffee nut are among the additions to the M&M\u2019s universe.", "authors": ["Maura Judkis", "Reporter Covering Culture", "Food", "The Arts", "September At Am", "Maura Judkis Is A Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering Culture", "The Arts.
