Friends go to the mall or department store together to try on clothes and ask each other for advice. Most online and offline shopping experiences are completely divorced from that, Agha said.\n\n\u201cFashion shopping has always been a social experience,\u201d said Agha, co-founder and co-CEO of Flip, in a statement . \u201cThe decision for today\u2019s shoppers to buy happens once they receive validation from friends and family, but e-commerce has made shopping very isolating. We are connecting the social behaviors of shopping, which were previously only possible offline, with a virtual experience.\u201d\n\nSo he wanted to take the social aspects of Instagram and the subscription box and retail elements of StitchFix to create the new Los Angeles-based startup, Flip Fit.\n\nBut to do it, Agha needed a push. His businesses in Dubai were successful, he says, and there was no need for him to pursue another new venture \u2014 especially one in America.\n\nThen he met Jonathan Ellman at the Summit conference in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe met at a party. At midnight,\u201d Ellman says. \u201cAt 10 o clock the next morning we were sitting on a balcony talking to each other and came to an understanding that Noor with his dynamics and understanding the industry\u2026 that he could not stay in Dubai.\u201d\n\nEllman has a history as an investor and an operator. He was the founder of the scout program at GreatPoint Ventures and spent years at HoneyBook. And he knew immediately that Agha\u2019s idea had legs.\n\nFor the next year, the two laid the foundation for the business. Noor had all of the connections already. Elabelz was pulling in $23 million in revenue off of the sale of 150,000 boxes of clothes \u2014 so the logistics and fulfillment and brand partnerships would be a breeze. The company has 200 brands that have already signed on as of today\u2019s launch including: AG, JBrand, Hudson, Retrobrand, Boyish, MadeWorn, Junkfood, Mavi and Edwin.\n\nFlipFit works by creating a social network based on friends and followers. The company isn\u2019t borrowing from Facebook or Instagram, but instead is trying to build out its network from scratch. Users of the app are encouraged to take vote on selfies their friends take in different outfits. Each vote garners in-app cash that can be redeemed whenever someone purchases an item ($10 for each new voting user and $1 per vote).\n\nAs users vote on the styles they like, they can also add clothes to a virtual wardrobe. When they\u2019re ready they can select a few styles from that closet to be shipped out to them to try on. If the user doesn\u2019t like the clothes, then they just return it.\n\nThe mechanics aren\u2019t that different from a number of other online retailers, but the difference is in the company\u2019s decision to create an entirely new social graph.\n\nInitially, Agha and Ellman are tapping influencers to hook in their target customers. Over the next 90 days roughly 500 influencers across social media will be encouraging their audiences to vote on different outfits using the FlipFit app. The influencers are getting $150 in store credit twice-a-month or getting paid sponsorships (depending on the size of their following). The outfits with the most votes are the ones that the influencers will keep\u2026 training their audiences on the mechanics of how to shop as they market the product.\n\nAgha says that the user experience is most akin to TikTok or Snap,rather than Instagram. There\u2019s a publicly available feed for those who want to use it or the feed can be made private and shared among friends. And the app is only available for children 13 and up.\n\nOn the business side, the company is keeping 33% of the cash from any item sold. It\u2019s cut is higher, because FlipFit handles all of the back end logistics of shipping and returns, according to the co-founders. Every box the company ships includes the standard pre-printed return label.\n\n\u201cReturns are our default. While the rest of the industry is fighting this phenomena, we are leaning into it,\u201d said Jonathan Ellman, co-founder and co-CEO of Flip. \u201cAlmost half of all fashion shoppers bracket their online purchases, buying several pieces to try on at home with the intention of returning what doesn\u2019t fit or what doesn\u2019t match what they saw online. We believe returns should be as easy as the purchase and by making the shopping process more efficient and effective, we\u2019re keeping clothes out of landfills and in your closet.\u201d\n\nThe company is, to date, backed by a $3.75 million seed round led by TLV Partners with participation from Lool Ventures.\n\n\u201cFlip is the evolution of social media and e-commerce \u2014 birthing the baby of Istagram and Amazon and creating the first physical product marketplace where your likes and actions impact the products you receive,\u201d says Rona Segev, a general partner at TLV.", "description": "Nooruldeen Agha, has been thinking about what\u2019s next for fashion retail for years.
