Alexis and Rom are goalscorers and good players, but at the moment, we made those decisions and they were the right decisions.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the only way you\u2019ve got to look at it. All the players here want to give everything for the club and for the shirt \u2013 that\u2019s a big thing.\n\n\u2018Every day that they come in training, and every day that they put the shirt on, they\u2019re going to give everything that they have. So you can\u2019t really say, \u2018oh I wish I didn\u2019t do that\u2019.\n\n\u2018Giving a couple of the lads the chance to show themselves, maybe it was a little bit too early for a few of them. But Mason Greenwood has stepped in and scored a couple in the midweek games, so it\u2019s a great experience for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We know we haven\u2019t had the results that we wanted, but I wouldn\u2019t have kept the players we sold. It was the right decision.\u2019\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hints at January signings and admits Manchester United failed with two moves last summer\n\nMORE: Solskjaer to make decision on three Man Utd youngsters ahead of January transfer window", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits several of Manchester United's youngsters have been promoted to the first team ahead of schedule in light of the departures of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1169518315_1571303115.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
