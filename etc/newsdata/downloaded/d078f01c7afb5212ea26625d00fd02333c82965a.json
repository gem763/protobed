In 2017, one in nine said they had done so.\n\nThe researchers who conducted the survey concluded that new safeguards were needed to protect teenagers, as \u201cthe developing brain is particularly susceptible to permanent changes from nicotine use and when almost all nicotine addiction is established\u201d.\n\nIn one of the suits filed on Monday, the Francis Howell School District in St Charles, which has about 18,000 students, accused Juul of \u201ctaking a page from big tobacco\u2019s playbook\u201d to develop \u201ca product and marketing strategy that sought to portray its e-cigarette products as trendsetting, stylish and used by the type of people teenagers look up to\u201d.\n\nThree Village Central School District in New York state also filed a lawsuit on Monday. Similar suits were expected in the coming weeks, said Jonathan Kieffer, a partner with Wagstaff & Cartmell, the Kansas City, Missouri, law firm that filed the first suits.\n\nAmong the steps that schools have had to take against vaping, Mr Kieffer said, were installing sensors in bathrooms, removing bathroom doors, banning flash drives, hiring more staff and paying for programmes that help students deal with nicotine addiction.\n\nThe suits did not specify the amount of damages the districts were seeking.\n\n\u201cIn numerous meetings that we have had with educators, administrators and board members across the country, the consistent theme that we have heard is that districts do not intend to stand by and allow this crisis to escalate but instead are taking a stand to protect their kids,\u201d he said.\n\nLegal experts said that though the suits were reminiscent of litigation against makers of guns, opioids and tobacco, the districts could face a stiff challenge in establishing their case.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with the school themselves,\u201d said Kathleen Hoke, a law professor at the University of Maryland who studies tobacco regulation. \u201cThe connection is to the students who have been marketed into addiction. I do think it\u2019s very unique.\u201d", "description": "With school districts across the United States scrambling to reverse the rise of vaping among teenagers, three of them on Monday filed suit against Juul, the e-cigarette manufacturer.They accused the company of endangering students and forcing educators to divert time and money to fight an epidemic of", "authors": ["Adeel Hassan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dKlivYj3Yi7BwpaJpCwgBA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/2ff4ecfc2270343c3cc02cda670824b3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
