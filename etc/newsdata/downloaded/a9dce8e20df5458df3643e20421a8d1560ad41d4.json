Now they\u2019re being melted down.", "language": "en", "text": "The move to scrap the coin was first reported by Bloomberg. As a result of that decision, any coins already produced will be melted down so that the metal can be reused in the future. A British Treasury spokesman told the BBC that a coin for Brexit would still be produced, but it \u201cwill enter circulation after we have left.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is not clear exactly how many coins were already produced or what their production cost. Earlier in the week, the Guardian reported that only 1,000 or so of the coins had been produced before production was halted. The paper noted that any surviving coins thus could become collectors\u2019 items worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nThe plans for the special 50 pence coin (technically worth approximately 64 cents) had been among the most tangible evidence that Johnson really did plan to take Britain out of the E.U. at the end of October. But given the uncertainty over that date, as well as the falling value of the British pound, critics argued they were another symbol of the folly of Brexit.\n\nA limited-edition commemorative Brexit coin was first announced in 2018 under then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and then-Prime Minister Theresa May. The coin\u2019s design would include the phrase \u201cFriendship with all nations\u201d and what was at that point the planned departure date: March 29, 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat date came and went without Britain leaving the E.U. After Johnson took office as prime minister in July, the plans were considerably expanded by Hammond\u2019s successor, Sajid Javid, with millions of coins slated to enter circulation, amended with the updated departure date of Oct. 31, 2019.\n\nJohnson had pledged to leave the European Union on that date \u2014 even if he could not reach an agreement with the E.U. on how Britain would leave, resulting in a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit that economists argued could ravage the British economy.\n\nJust last month, Johnson said he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit. But because he missed a mid-October deadline to get his withdrawal deal approved by Parliament, the prime minister was forced to send a letter to European leaders requesting an extension to January, which they approved on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohnson is pushing for a general election before the end of the year, with lawmakers voting on the proposal on Tuesday evening.\n\nBritain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on June 23, 2016. The country was originally scheduled to leave the bloc on March 29, 2019, but May requested an extension until April 12 after she failed to get her deal through Parliament. Britain subsequently received another extension that set the new deadline at Oct. 31.\n\nUncertainly over Britain\u2019s economic future has significantly hurt the value of the pound, once one of the world\u2019s strongest currencies. The pound was approximately $1.50 against the U.S. dollar before the 2016 vote but is valued this week at around $1.29.\n\nAD", "description": "Plans for millions of Brexit 50 pence coins have been put on hold as Britain gets another extension on staying in the European Union.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FUMltIKsLt7XLZnzR8XNIPrEq1U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EA6YJ7X2K4I6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
