But his profile was such that he would not have gotten a visa easily,\u201d a senior police officer told local media. \u201cWith a fake name - Amrik Singh, a fake address, he managed to get a passport and a U.S. visa. We've never seen a similar case at the Delhi airport before,\" he added.\n\nThis is how Amreek Singh aka Jayesh Patel was nabbed at IGI Airport by an alert Sub Inspector of @CISFHQrs .
