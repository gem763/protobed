MacArthur Foundation John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation\n\nTwenty-six creators and thinkers drawn from a vast array of fields just got a big financial boost \u2014 and an even bigger name to add to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation unveiled the winners of this year's MacArthur fellowships \u2014 often better known as the \"genius\" grants \u2014 recognizing the host of artists and scholars for their creativity and potential.\n\n\"From addressing the consequences of climate change to furthering our understanding of human behavior to fusing forms of artistic expression, this year's 26 extraordinary MacArthur Fellows demonstrate the power of individual creativity to reframe old problems, spur reflection, create new knowledge, and better the world for everyone,\" the foundation's president, John Palfrey, said in a statement released Wednesday.\n\n\"They give us reason for hope,\" he added, \"and they inspire us all to follow our own creative instincts.\"\n\nAlong with inclusion on an illustrious list of past fellows \u2014 more than 1,000 in all, since the program's first class in 1981 \u2014 each of this year's grantees gets a $625,000 stipend, meted out in quarterly installments over five years with no strings attached.\n\nThe idea is simple: Unlike, say, a professional athlete or tech entrepreneur, excellence in a field such as philosophy or geophysics doesn't exactly pay big bucks. But achievements in any field often require money anyway, whether that may be for materials or simply the free time and ease of mind that come with financial stability. MacArthur judges hope that more than half a million dollars will help with that.\n\nHowever they use it, the 26 fellows below just got a rather useful feather in their caps. Here they are \u2014 paired with NPR's previous coverage of their work, when available.\n\n(Note: The MacArthur Foundation is among NPR's financial supporters.)\n\nElizabeth Anderson, 59, philosopher\n\n\"Employing pragmatist methods to examine the ways that various institutions, policies, and social practices serve to promote or hinder conditions of democratic equality.\"\n\nSujatha Baliga, 48, attorney and restorative justice practitioner\n\n\"Expanding access to survivor-centered restorative justice strategies that interrupt the criminalization of people of color and break cycles of recidivism and violence.\"\n\nLynda Barry, 63, graphic novelist, cartoonist and educator\n\n\"Inspiring creative engagement through original graphic works and a teaching practice centered on the role of image making in communication.\"\n\nMel Chin, 67, artist\n\n\"Harnessing the power of art to raise awareness of social concerns through a practice that defies categorization.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDanielle Citron, 50, legal scholar\n\n\"Addressing the scourge of cyber harassment by raising awareness of the toll it takes on victims and proposing reforms to combat the most extreme forms of online abuse.\"\n\nLisa Daugaard, 53, criminal justice reformer\n\n\"Developing alternative approaches to policing and law enforcement practices to improve outcomes for those struggling with substance use disorder and mental illness.\"\n\nAnnie Dorsen, 45, theater artist\n\n\"Pioneering a new genre of theater that dramatizes the ways in which nonhuman intelligence is profoundly changing the nature of work, culture, and social relationships.\"\n\nMusic Interviews 'Passing Strange' a Real Rock Musical 'Passing Strange' a Real Rock Musical Listen\n\nAndrea Dutton, 46, geochemist and paleoclimatologist\n\n\"Furthering current understanding of sea level dynamics by reconstructing the extent and rate of sea level rise in the ancient past.\"\n\nEnvironment U.S. Faces 'Immediate Threat' From Climate Change, Report Says U.S. Faces 'Immediate Threat' From Climate Change, Report Says Listen \u00b7 4:25 4:25\n\nJeffrey Gibson, 47, visual artist\n\n\"Melding indigenous North American materials and forms with those of Western contemporary art to create a new hybrid visual vocabulary and prompting a shift in how Native American art is perceived and historicized.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sam Tsang/South China Morning Post via Getty Images Sam Tsang/South China Morning Post via Getty Images\n\nMary Halvorson, 38, guitarist and composer\n\n\"Experimenting at the intersection of jazz and rock with a signature sound on her instrument and an aesthetic that evolves and surprises with each new album and configuration of bandmates.\"\n\nSaidiya Hartman, 58, literary scholar and cultural historian\n\n\"Tracing the afterlife of slavery in modern American life and rescuing from oblivion stories of sparsely documented lives that have been systematically excluded from historical archives.\"\n\nCrossing the Divide 'Lose Your Mother' Author Finds Heritage in Africa 'Lose Your Mother' Author Finds Heritage in Africa Listen\n\nWalter Hood, 61, landscape and public artist\n\n\"Creating ecologically sustainable urban spaces that resonate with and enrich the lives of current residents while also honoring communal histories.\"\n\nStacy Jupiter, 43, marine scientist\n\n\"Integrating local cultural practices with field research to design conservation strategies that protect ecosystem biodiversity and the well-being of coastal communities.\"\n\nZachary Lippman, 41, plant biologist\n\n\"Investigating the genetic mechanisms determining flowering and flower production and developing tools for breeding hardier, higher-yielding crops.\"\n\nValeria Luiselli, 36, writer\n\n\"Challenging conventional notions of authorship in fiction, essays, and inventive hybrids of the two that pose profound questions about the various ways we piece together stories and document the lives of others.\"\n\nKelly Lytle Hern\u00e1ndez, 45, historian\n\n\"Challenging long-held beliefs about the origins, ideology, and evolution of incarceration and immigrant detention practices in the United States.\"\n\nSarah Michelson, 55, choreographer\n\n\"Expanding the scope of contemporary dance in works that extend and subvert classical, modern, and postmodern traditions and make evident the physical realities of dancers' performance.\"\n\nJeffrey Alan Miller, 35, literary scholar\n\n\"Shedding light on how the writing practices of Renaissance scholars shaped foundational texts of modern Christianity, philosophy, and literature.\"\n\nJerry X.
