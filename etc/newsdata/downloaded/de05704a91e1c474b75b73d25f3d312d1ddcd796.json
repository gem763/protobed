The new proposal would entitle it to act after a single complainant showed that it had been disadvantaged; and\n\nThe guidelines establish a reverse onus of proof, said Daryl Dingley, a partner in the competition team at Webber Wentzel. When a complainant proves that there is a prima facie case of price discrimination, the onus is on the dominant firm to show that it has not acted unlawfully.\n\nDingley said this would make it easier for the authorities to prosecute and increases risks for companies which will have to ensure that they do not fall foul of the law.\n\nThe guidelines dictate that price discrimination must be substantial.\n\nIt will be regarded as \u201csubstantial\u201d if the price difference is more than 5% for critical inputs and more than 10% for all other inputs.\n\nA critical input is a product or service that constitutes more than 20% of the final product\u2019s costs.\n\nWhen it comes to bulk buyers, said the commission, SME\u2019s and historically disadvantaged businesses\u2019 relatively weak bargaining power are sometimes exploited to impose unfair low prices and trading conditions.\n\nThis has the effect of passing unnecessary costs or risks to smaller suppliers.\n\nThe guidelines also contain purchasing provisions for specific sectors, namely agriculture, wholesalers and retailers in the groceries\u2019 sector, as well as online intermediary platforms.\n\nSome of the trading conditions that would be regarded as unreasonable in the groceries and agricultural processing sectors include:\n\nPayment terms of longer than 30 days for perishable goods and 60 days for other products;\n\nCancellations of orders for perishable goods on short notice; and\n\nBuyers that require the complainant to cough up for wastage or complaints that are not a result of the supplier\u2019s negligence.\n\nFor online intermediary services, unreasonable trading conditions include limitations on the sale of the same product through different channels and the use of data that is acquired through the supplier\u2019s sales to compete with that supplier.\n\nIf a complaint is received, the commission will first attempt to mediate the dispute.\n\nRespondents against whom various complaints have been received, and who have a clearly discriminatory policy, will be prioritised for investigation and possible prosecution, said the commission.\n\nLegal experts are of the opinion that the guidelines could be in effect by early next year.\n\nAhmore Burger-Smidt, director of competition at Werksmans, said there would be a heavy burden on companies to defend themselves because they would essentially find themselves in an information vacuum.\n\nThis was because they were not allowed to insist on seeing the costing structures of smaller firms.\n\nJennifer Finnigan, from Shepstone & Wylie Attorneys, said dominant firms should revise their acquisitions and price structures to ensure that they comply with the new legal requirements.\n\nFor multinational companies with standard prices based on volume, the additional complexity and risk associated with buying from or selling to the designated groups \u2013 with the fact that you can be penalised if it appears that you have attempted to be avoiding trade with these groups \u2013 could be just a further compliance headache when it comes to doing business in South Africa.\n\nStakeholders have until November 7 to comment.", "description": "Rules are designed to protect SMEs, as well as historically disadvantaged groups.", "authors": ["Riana De Lange"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/c47896a0a32542c88bd65b5a69292a37.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
