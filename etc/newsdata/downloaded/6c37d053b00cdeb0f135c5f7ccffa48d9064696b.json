In his eyes he\u2019s \u2018King Kev\u2019 \u2013 and he\u2019s done phenomenal routines with his previous partners. This series is one he wants to forget.\u201d\n\nHowever, some fans reckon their unceremonious exit was down to more than just Anneka's ability, and claimed the choreography was below Kevin's usual show-stopping standards.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I honestly think Kev deliberately created a dance so ruddy awful that he knew he would be out... I have a feeling Kev is only happy when he's winning,\" one fan commented.\n\nAnother said the skilled dancer had \"floundered like a salmon\", while one commented, \"With that terrible routine it seems Kevin wanted out.\"\n\nOthers suggested it was Anneka who wanted to leave, with one sniping that she \"didn't seem to try in the dance-off.\"\n\n\"I like Anneka as a presenter, but she did not even try with this 'dance,'\" agreed another, adding, \"She acted as though she was on the show against her will.\"\n\nKevin certainly appeared to acknowledge the dance wasn't up to scratch when he sarcastically joked that the judges had wasted their tens on Oti Mabuse and Kelvin Fletcher.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nAnd as the axe came down on Sunday, the thrice-married star was reportedly overheard telling two dancers, \"I told you so.\"\n\nBut why would he have wanted to leave?\n\nThe ambitious dancer is said to have been 'fuming' when he was paired with Anneka, having apparently hoped to win for a second time with Catherine Tyldesley or Alex Scott.\n\nHowever, after being linked to the relationship breakdowns of two celeb partners - including Stacey Dooley who was dating Sam Tucknott during last year's series - sources claimed the Beeb wanted a pairing that would ensure a \"sleaze-free\" show.\n\n\u201cGiven Kevin's reputation, justified or otherwise, no chances will be taken. He won\u2019t be given a hot, single female, or stunning pop star for example,\" a source told The Sun.\n\nAnd another claimed Kevin believed, \"people at the top [were] putting the boot in for the fallout from his relationship with Stacey.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nInitially it was reported that he wouldn't be given a partner at all in 2019, but winners are apparently contractually obliged to get a celebrity pairing the following year.\n\nBreaking her silence after his elimination, Stacey defended her man and hinted at their frustrations.\n\n\"I just wanted to say that I am so proud of both of them but particularly Kevin,\" she told fans in an Instagram video.\n\n\"I just think he's the most incredible teacher and I think she was so lucky to have had him.\n\n\"It's very easy to be proud of someone when you're winning and flying high and it's all going brilliantly, but it's also very important to tell them that you think they're wicked when they're the second to get knocked out!\"", "description": "Last year's reigning champion Kevin Clifton suffered a humiliating defeat when he and his celeb partner Anneka Rice were knocked out in the second round of Strictly Come Dancing", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Bbc", "Guy Levy", "Pa", "Mirrorpix", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530544.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_All-the-conspiracy-theories-about-Kevin-Cliftons-Strictly-exit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
