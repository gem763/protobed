We hope the Retirement Living Standards will transform the way people think about what money they might need for their retirement.\"\n\nThe new Retirement Living Standards report breaks people's life after work into three categories - minimum, moderate and comfortable - then worked out the cost of living them.\n\nThe minimum lifestyle covers your essential bills plus some fun - you could holiday in the UK, eat out about once a month and do some \"affordable\" leisure activities about twice a week. It budgets \u00a3460 a year for clothes and shoes.\n\nTo reach that level you need \u00a310,200 a year for a single person or \u00a315,700 for a couple.\n\nGiven the state pension comes in at \u00a38,767.20 a year - your standard workplace pension should cover you - although If you live in London, you'll need a little extra because of the higher cost of living.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe moderate lifestyle includes the costs of owning and running a car (replaced every 10 years), as well as tripling the amount you can spend on birthday and Christmas presents and teo overseas holidays a year. It costs \u00a320,200 a year for singles and \u00a329,100 for couples. But to get to this level you'll need to put more work into your savings now.\n\nAt the comfortable level you get a much better quality of life - your weekly food budget is \u00a356, there is money to replace your car every 5 years, pay for beauty treatments and three overseas holidays are included. You also get to spend up to \u00a31,500 a year on clothes and food and can splash \u00a350 a present on friends and relatives.\n\nIt also costs the most, coming in at \u00a333,000 a year for singles and \u00a347,500 for couples.\n\nJackie Spencer from the Money and Pensions Service said: \u201cSaving for something is easier to do when you can visualise what you\u2019re working towards, which is why people are often more motivated to save for short-term goals like holidays and new cars than they are for their retirement.\n\n\u201cThe new Retirement Living Standards are a great way of offering savers some practical examples of what they can expect from their lives when they stop working.\u201d\n\nTop tips from the PLSA for a better retirement", "description": "If you'd like a retirement where you can still afford three foreign holidays a year sand to be able foo replace your car every five years you need to have saved an awful lot of cash first", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8190203.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Elderly-couple-riding-bikes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
