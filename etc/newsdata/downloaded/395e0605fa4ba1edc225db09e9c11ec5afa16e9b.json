For the iconography at least! The rapper has been talking about settling down for months (her Twitter name is already Mrs. Petty), and it looks like they went and made it official. She posted a video on Instagram showing off Mr. and Mrs. mugs with bride and groom baseball caps. The caption laid it all out: \u201cOnika Tanya Maraj-Petty 10\u202221\u202219\u201d In the comments, Christina Aguilera, Naomi Campbell, La La Anthony, and more congratulated her.\n\nMinaj obtained a marriage license back in June, according to TMZ, but told Queen Radio listeners in August that she was getting it renewed and was set to be married in about two months. Looks like that fairy tale came true. She and her new husband were young loves who reunited after years apart. In between, Minaj became a world-famous rapper and Petty was convicted for manslaughter and attempted rape. Now that they\u2019re together, Minaj is only looking toward the future. \u201cBut go awf, internet, y\u2019all can\u2019t run my life,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram comment defending her relationship last December. \u201cY\u2019all can\u2019t even run y\u2019all own life.\u201d\n\nWe would be curious about whatever love songs Minaj is cooking up, but she says she\u2019s retiring from music for a while to start a family. A bunch of little Pettys running around? But the Barbz are right there.", "description": "Rapper Nicki Minaj just announced her marriage to boyfriend Kenneth Petty.
