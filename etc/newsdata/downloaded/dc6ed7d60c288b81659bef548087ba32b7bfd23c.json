The Election Commission opened a two-hour period for nominations Monday.\n\nStill, the 35 candidates are the most to contest a presidential election in the Indian Ocean island nation. The previous high was 22 candidates in 2010.\n\nRajapaksa's main rival will be Sajith Premadasa, from the governing coalition. He is a son of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was assassinated in 1993 by the Tamil Tiger rebels. The rebels were eventually defeated in the civil war.\n\nAmong the presidential candidates are two Buddhist monks, four people from the country's minority Muslim community and two from the Tamil community. There is only one female candidate.", "description": "President Maithripala Sirisena did not pay a mandatory deposit and became ineligible to file a nomination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/78f5d461920441c5b337a68caecb2936_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
