For better or worse, bad things can happen almost anywhere and at any time.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not surprising that a handful of companies have sprung up to meet the demand for using this tech to protect what matters most to us, our children.\n\nLori Alhadeff is haunted by the fact that she did not send her 14-year-old daughter to school with a bulletproof backpack. The mother of three had wanted to buy one but never got around to it. By Feb. 14, 2018, it was too late. Her first child, Alyssa, was fatally shot trying to hide under a classroom table at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. \u201cI wish to this day that I did give that protection to Alyssa. It could have saved her life,\u201d Alhadeff says. \u201cObviously, I regret that.\u201d After the massacre, which killed 16 others, Alhadeff bought bulletproof backpacks for her two sons, who are now 14 and 12. \u201cI have peace in my heart for my two boys, at least, that I\u2019m doing everything in my power to protect them,\u201d says Alhadeff, who won\u2019t let her sons go to school without the backpacks. With more than 69 people killed so far in mass shootings in the U.S. in 2019, thousands of Americans like Alhadeff are seeking security through an explosion of products marketed to those scared of being shot or of losing loved ones to gun violence. Backpacks that double as shields are sold by major department stores, including Home Depot and Bed, Bath & Beyond. There are bulletproof hoodies for children as young as 6; protective whiteboards and windows; armored doors and anchors designed to keep shooters out of classrooms; and smart cameras powered by artificial intelligence that alert authorities to threats. In Fruitport, Mich., officials are building a $48 million high school specially designed to deter active shooters, with curved walls to reduce a shooter\u2019s line of sight, bulletproof windows and a special locking system.\n\nThe free market is a wonderful thing. It\u2019ll put out products that will make it possible to minimize the actual threat to children and keep a lot of people employed in the meantime.\n\nHowever, it seems not everyone is OK with this. Among them, Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts.\n\nIn 2017, U.S. schools spent at least $2.7 billion on security systems, and that\u2019s on top of the money spent by individuals on things like bulletproof backpacks, the IHS Markit consulting firm reported. Five years ago, in 2014, the figure was about $768 million, IHS said. But school shootings haven\u2019t decreased in frequency, and critics of the growing industry in bullet-resistant items say the only beneficiaries of these so-called security measures are the people making money off of them. \u201cThese companies are capitalizing on parents\u2019 fears,\u201d says Shannon Watts, a mother of five who founded the gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre that killed 20 first-graders and six educators.\n\nOh, that\u2019s rich coming from a woman who jumps on every shooting she can find to prattle on about how dangerous it is all the time so the donations can keep rolling into her group.\n\nShe literally capitalizes on parents\u2019 fears just so she can get a paycheck, for crying out loud. That\u2019s her entire schtick. That\u2019s why she freaks out over relatively innocuous firearms. That\u2019s why she continues to associate with a group that uses a BS definition of \u201cschool shooting\u201d despite having been criticized for it over and over again.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Shannon Watts and the gun-grabbing movement is predicated almost exclusively on \u201ccapitalizing on parents\u2019 fears\u201d in the wake of actual school shootings.\n\nFor her to criticize companies that are providing protective clothing and bookbags simply because there\u2019s a demand for it is ridiculous. You might as well claim restaurants are just capitalizing on people\u2019s hunger. It may be factually accurate, but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re wrong to do so.\n\nWhat bothers Watts, however, is that these companies are allowing parents to take proactive steps to protect their children instead of sending money to groups like hers and voting the way she wants them to. Plain and simple.\n\nAfter all, look at her quote here:\n\nBut with efforts at gun control legislation stalled as the Senate refuses to take up a House-passed bill that would require background checks for private gun sales, even critics of the booming security industry concede it\u2019s unlikely to slow down. \u201cThere\u2019s not a parent in the country who isn\u2019t worried that their child will be the next victim of gun violence,\u201d Watts says.\n\nActually, I\u2019m not particularly worried that my children will be the next victim of gun violence. We don\u2019t live in a particularly dangerous neighborhood and school shootings are remarkably rare, even if they\u2019re horrifying when they do happen. I\u2019m more worried about my kids being injured in a car accident, truth be told.\n\nBut Watts doesn\u2019t like that. She wants parents worried. She can manipulate worried parents.\n\nThese products? They reduce the worry, and she doesn\u2019t like that.\n\nSo, she\u2019ll fling around her hypocrisy and pretend that she represents the only responsible option for parents.\n\nI think I injured myself laughing at the possibility.", "description": "The Moms Demand Action founder claims companies who make bullet-resistant garments for kids are capitalizing on fear, which is her entire schtick.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
