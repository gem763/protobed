Attended by a small number of family and friends, it could not have been nicer. Camp David is a special place. Cost of the event will be totally paid for by me! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2019\n\nIvanka Trump and Kushner serve in the administration as Trump\u2019s senior advisers.\n\nOn Instagram, the president\u2019s daughter shared a throwback photo of the day she and Kushner wed.\n\n\u201cEverything about you is real, kind, humble and brave,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cYou inspire me with your calm, stoic disposition and unwavering prioritization of that which matters most in life.\u201d\n\nWhile presidents often use Camp David to host meetings with foreign leaders or to negotiate deals, the rural residence can also be used as a private getaway for presidents and their immediate families.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush celebrated holidays with his family at the executive retreat, located 70 miles from the White House in Maryland\u2019s Catoctin Mountain Park. As The Washington Post reported in 2015, former first lady Michelle Obama was known to visit Camp David frequently, sometimes taking her daughters with her.\n\nHowever, Trump, who owns properties around the world, didn\u2019t seem too fond of Camp David early in his presidency.\n\nAs several news organizations have pointed out, Trump apparently joked to a European journalist shortly before his inauguration that the rural estate was a \u201cvery rustic\u201d place that one could only enjoy \u201cfor about 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nIn September, Trump had plans to hold another higher-stakes event at Camp David.\n\nIn a surprising revelation, the president said he invited the Taliban and the president of Afghanistan to the retreat in order to negotiate a peace deal between the two. Trump ultimately rescinded the invitation after the Taliban admitted that it was responsible for a deadly attack in Kabul that left one U.S. soldier and 11 others dead.", "description": "The couple, who also serve as President Donald Trump's advisers, celebrated 10 years of marriage at the presidential rural retreat.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db4af0a210000602b34b236.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
