Video streaming company iQiyi Inc (IQ.O) leads with its $2.4 billion listing, followed by online group discounter Pinduoduo Inc (PDD.O) at $1.6 billion and electric vehicle maker NIO Inc (NIO.N) at $1.15 billion.\n\nReturns for investors have been mixed, with the 31 Chinese IPOs in 2018 down an average of around 11 percent as of Dec. 10, according to data provider Dealogic.\n\nWith streaming apps QQ Music, KuGou, Kuwo as well as karaoke app We Sing, Tencent Music is China\u2019s largest online music platform boasting more than 800 million active users monthly.The firm is often compared with Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N) but offers more socially interactive services that make it profitable while its Swedish counterpart is not.\n\nTencent Music initially planned to launch the deal in October but postponed because of a sell-off in global markets roiled by a U.S.-China trade war and fears of slowing global growth.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A Tencent sign is seen during the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, December 4, 2017.
