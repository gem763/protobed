Watch it above for a little Christingle in the baubles.\n\nWe caught up with the Bridesmaid\u2019s director just two days after he locked the final edit of the film ahead of its release on 15 November, to find out what to expect from the George Michael-inspired rom-com that stars Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding as star-crossed lovers in London.\n\nFrom the real-life person who inspired Michelle Yeoh\u2019s character to Paul Feig\u2019s favourite festive film and his take on the \u201cis Die Hard a Christmas movie?\u201d debate, here\u2019s six new things we just learned about Last Christmas.\n\nLast Christmas was originally only going to include a couple of George Michael songs\n\nView photos Paul Feig, director of the upcoming film \"Last Christmas,\" 2019, in Las Vegas.

Acclaimed actor, screenwriter, and all-round national treasure Emma Thompson took on the challenge, with support from the song\u2019s writer George Michael, whose only stipulation was that the film tackled homelessness, a cause very dear to the singer\u2019s heart.\n\nRead more: Andrew Ridgeley to cameo in Last Christmas\n\nPaul Feig came on board after George Michael sadly passed in 2016, and a deep dive into the singer\u2019s history and back catalogue convinced the filmmaker to expand the film\u2019s soundtrack from just one of his hits, to a sackful of them.\n\n\u201cIt started snowballing in prep,\u201d explains Feig. \u201cI was suddenly adding songs into the actual film that we would have the characters sing - but not in a musical way - just in a very organic way.\n\nView photos (From left) Kate (Emilia Clarke) and Petra (Emma Thompson) in Last Christmas, directed by Paul Feig. More\n\n\u201cAnd then once we got into post, then I started going, \u2018Oh, this song actually can work really well in this scene\u2019. And so it just really built organically.\n\n\u201cIt's not a jukebox movie, but it's not a musical either. I call it \u2018a soundtrack to your life\u2019 movie. We've all got songs that means so much to us, and this character in the movie [Kate, Emilia Clarke], she wants to be a singer and her favourite singer is George Michael. It\u2019s this idea that one artist represents you and stays with you, as you're going through crises and going through the harder parts of your life.\u201d\n\nView photos English singer, songwriter and musician, George Michael (1963-2016) performs live on stage at an Aids awareness charity concert at Wembley Arena in London in April 1987.

And then by the time I finished post, I\u2019d put in like 15 songs. Because they all just work in such a great way.\u201d\n\nOne of those songs is a brand new, previously unheard George Michael song that will play over the film\u2019s final scene.\n\nEmilia Clarke plays a singer but Paul Feig didn\u2019t know she could sing\n\nView photos Kate (Emilia Clarke) in the romantic comedy Last Christmas, directed by Paul Feig.
