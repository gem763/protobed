Angry residents hurled potatoes at the vehicles, shouting \u201cNo America\u201d and \u201cAmerica liar\u201d in English.\n\n\u201cLike rats, America is running away,\u201d one man shouted in Arabic. Another shouted obscenities and talked of babies in Kurdish-held Syria who had died in the Turkish offensive.\n\nThe scene encapsulated the Kurds\u2019 feelings of betrayal and added a new indignity to a US withdrawal that has been rushed and involved several close brushes with Turkish-backed forces.\n\nThe Kurds were stunned when Donald Trump abruptly decided two weeks ago to pull US troops out of border areas, abandoning the Kurdish-backed fighters who as US allies had performed the bulk of the ground fighting against Islamic State. After the Turkish assault began on 9 October, Trump ordered a general withdrawal from Syria.\n\nPlay Video 1:33 Trump calls decision to withdraw US troops from Syria 'strategically brilliant' \u2013 video\n\nAt another location, near the town of Tal Tamr, a group of protesters held up banners to departing US troops on Sunday, according to an Associated Press video.\n\nOne man blocked the way of a US van with a poster reading: \u201cThanks for US people, but Trump betrayed us.\u201d\n\nThe US president has said he was bringing troops home from \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East but the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said all US troops would withdraw to western Iraq and continue operations against Isis.\n\nEsper said on Monday he was discussing an option that would keep a small residual US military force in Syria to secure oil fields and continue the fight against Isis, but he had not yet made a final decision or presented the option to Trump.\n\nA ceasefire negotiated by the US to allow Kurdish-led forces to evacuate from a Turkish-designated \u201csafe zone\u201d 20 miles (32 km) south of its border with Syria for the 75 miles (121 km) between the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad expires on Tuesday.\n\nTurkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, renewed warnings that his country would resume its military offensive in north-east Syria if Kurdish fighters don\u2019t vacate the region before then.\n\nKurdish officials have accused Turkey of violating the ceasefire, saying it has shelled border villages, while Turkey has accused Syrian Kurdish groups of 30 live fire violations of the truce, which killed one Turkish soldier.\n\nMost Kurdish civilians have fled Ras al-Ayn, fearing killings or repression by Turkish-backed forces, and any still in the territory that the Kurdish fighters are leaving are likely to do the same.\n\nA senior Kurdish official, Redur Khalil, called for an international mechanism to protect Kurdish civilians who want to stay in their towns after Kurdish-led fighters leave.\n\n\n\nTurkey says it wants to return Syrian refugees to the areas evacuated by Kurdish forces. A crucial meeting between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Tuesday is expected to further address arrangements along the Syria-Turkish border.", "description": "Scenes in Kurdish city demonstrate sense of betrayal amid rushed US withdrawal", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Nesrine Malik"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
