As CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips reported Wednesday morning, the consequences weren't looking great \u2014 for the country or for Johnson.\n\nIn his first major test since taking office, the man President Trump said would \"do a great job\" as prime minister, lost.\n\nThe lawmakers of the House of Commons voted 328 to 301 on Tuesday evening to wrest control of the Brexit process from the prime minister.\n\nOn Wednesday they will vote again, and with 21 of Johnson's fellow-Conservatives having showing their willingness to oppose him, it looked all but certain that Johnson would be stripped of his one negotiating card with the European Union; his threat to walk away from the EU at the end of October, with or without a new trade deal in place.\n\nJohnson's response was one that many people believe he's been planning all along; he threatened to call a national election.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson loses majority after Brexit vote\n\n\"I don't want an election, the public don't want an election,\" Johnson told parliament before Tuesday's vote, \"but if MPs (Members of Parliament) vote tomorrow to stop negotiations and to compel another pointless delay to Brexit, potentially for years, then that would be the only way to resolve this.\"\n\nThe opposition's response: Bring it on \u2014 but only after a \"no-deal\" Brexit is completely off the table.\n\n\"So he wants to table a motion for a general election,\" said Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party. \"Fine. Get the bill through first in order to prevent\u2026 in order to take no-deal off the table.\"\n\nJohnson no longer has a majority in parliament. His party threw out the Conservative MPs who voted against him on Tuesday night, including Winston Churchill's grandson.\n\nAn election seems the likeliest outcome. A new national vote could bolster Johnson's mandate to deliver Brexit on any terms. Or it could see him forced out of the office he's held for less than half a year, with completely unclear consequences for the EU withdrawal plan.\n\nIt also wasn't clear on Wednesday morning when an election could actually take place, but with the dramatic move in parliament against Johnson, Brexit seemed headed for yet another delay.", "description": "Boris Johnson is threatening to answer a major defeat in parliament by calling a new election, which could help him, or end his short stint in office and derail his Brexit ambitions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/8f37b622-8127-4e05-8ad5-1be1177c3931/thumbnail/1200x630/420f17286eecc62e1543b3909a2352c8/boris-johnson-parliament.jpg"}
