It came shortly after a separate letter from Kim that Trump made public in the first week of August.\n\nThe White House offered no immediate comment on the report.\n\nMr Trump said in early August that Mr Kim had sent him a \"very beautiful letter\" that mostly complained \"about the ridiculous and expensive\" joint military drills between the US and South Korea, adding that Mr Kim had apologised for the short range missile tests. It's not clear whether Mr Trump has responded to either letter, according to the report.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nWorking-level talks on denuclearisation have stalled since Mr Trump and Mr Kim's last official summit in Hanoi ended without a deal. While the pair agreed to restart talks in June at an impromptu meeting in which Mr Trump made history by stepping across the border into North Korea, little progress has been made since then. North Korea last week agreed to return to talks at a \"time and place to be agreed late in September\", state media Korean Central News Agency said, citing Vice-Foreign minister Choe Son Hui.\n\nMr Choe, however, threatened to walk away from future talks if the US returns with the same \"worn-out scenario\", KCNA reported, without elaborating further.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [SEOUL] North Korean leader Kim Jong Un invited US President Donald Trump to visit Pyongyang, Joongang Ilbo reported, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. .
