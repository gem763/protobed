The result? A castle that's the stuff of fairytales.\n\n2. St Vitus Cathedral\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe largest cathedral in Prague, St Vitus has been the setting for plenty of historic moments including the coronations of Czech kings and queens.\n\nIt's also where several patron saints, archbishops and noblemen are buried.\n\nBut the history isn't the only draw here. The cathedral boasts some seriously spectacular architecture with its intricate decor, awe-inspiring stained glass windows and grandiose feel.\n\n3. Charles Bridge\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nCrossing the Vlatava river, Charles Bridge can be a great spot for a leisurely stroll that offers up unrivalled views of the city.\n\nThe bridge links Prague Castle to the Old Town so it's ideal if you're looking to get plenty of sightseeing done on foot.\n\nHead here at sunset for a view with an extra touch of magic.\n\n4. Old Town Square\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nPrague's Historic Centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to the wide array of Baroque and Gothic buildings to be found here.\n\nThe historic Old Town Square has plenty of beautiful landmarks including the St Nicholas Church, the Old Town Hall, memorials and the Astronomical Clock.\n\n5. Astronomical Clock\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe third oldest astronomical clock in the world, this medieval tower clock is pretty impressive.\n\nTry and time it (no pun intended) to be there when the clock strikes the hour, so you can see the procession of the Twelve Apostles (this occurs on the hour from 9am through to 11pm).\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a popular attraction in Prague so during peak season it can get quite busy.\n\n6. Municipal House\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nOn the outside, Municipal House is a beautiful Art Nouveau building with intricate architecture and bursts of colour. Inside, it's equally as dazzling, playing home to Smetana Hall, an opulent concert hall.\n\nThe building has some restaurants and caf\u00e9s if you're looking for somewhere a bit different to have a bite to eat.\n\n7. Josefov\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJosefov is the former Jewish Ghetto in Prague, located between the Old Town Square and the Vltava River.\n\nThe quarter is home to six Synagogues as well as plenty of monuments.\n\nNowadays you need a ticket to enter the Jewish Quarter, and we recommend joining a guided tour so you don't miss the highlights while also getting to learn all about Prague's fascinating history.\n\n8. Golden Lane\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nA street within the Prague Castle complex, Golden Lane was originally built in the 16th century to house the castle guards, but it takes its name from the goldsmiths who resided here in the 17th century.\n\nThe street is also nicknamed as the Street of Alchemists with myths that the king's alchemists also lived here for a brief period of time.\n\n9. The Lennon Wall\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nArt and music fans won't want to miss out this eye-catching wall which, since the 1980s, has been covered with John Lennon-inspired graffiti from Beatles song lyrics to plenty of tributes to the iconic singer as well as more global causes.\n\n10. National Gallery\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIf the weather lets you down or you just love a museum trip, then the National Gallery in Prague could be ideal.\n\nThere are heaps of fascinating exhibitions, thousands of beautiful works of art, and the building itself boasts some pretty ornate architecture.", "description": "Prague travel guide including the best things to see and do from Prague Castle to St Vitus Cathedral", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758046.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_charles-bridge-in-Prague-at-Sunset-Czech-Republic.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
