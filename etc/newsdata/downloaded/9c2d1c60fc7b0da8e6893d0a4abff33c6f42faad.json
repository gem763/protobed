Jerry Nadler, told Lewandowski his \u201cbehavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable,\u201d and said holding him \"in contempt\" is \"certainly under consideration.\"\n\nLewandowski immediately frustrated Nadler, the committee's chairman, during the Democrat's first question earlier in the day \u2013 when the witness, in an apparent effort to stall for time, repeatedly asked Nadler to point to the specific section in the Robert Mueller report related to his question. Lewandowski was following White House orders not to discuss confidential conversations with the president beyond what was already public in the former special counsel's report.\n\nDOJ USES DEMOCRATS\u2019 IMPEACHMENT CONFUSION AGAINST THEM IN COURT\n\nAsked by Nadler if he met alone with President Donald Trump in June 2017, Lewandowski said, \u201cCould you read the exact language of the report? I don\u2019t have it available to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to do that,\u201d Nadler shot back. \u201cI have limited time.\u201d\n\nAsked the question again, Lewandowski told Nadler he needed him to \u201crefresh\u201d his memory of what was in the report. He demanded that Democrats provide him a copy of the report, sending Democratic staff scrambling to find one.\n\n\"He's filibustering,\" a frustrated Nadler said.\n\nAmid the back-and-forth, the top Republican on the committee, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, moved to adjourn the hearing, forcing a failed voice vote that caused further delay, before questioning resumed from other lawmakers.\n\nLewandowski later declined to play along with certain questions. New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries asked Lewandowski if he was Trump\u2019s \u201chitman, the bag man, the lookout, or all of the above?\"\n\n\"I think I'm the good looking man, actually,\" Lewandowski replied.\n\nLewandowski is considering a run for the Senate in New Hampshire in 2020. In a reminder of the political backdrop, during a recess, the witness tweeted out a link to a website promoting his possible candidacy. And Democrats referenced his ambitions.\n\n\"You are not on the campaign trail yet,\" Jeffries said. \"This is the House Judiciary Committee. Act like you know the difference.\"\n\nThere were fireworks from the beginning. Nadler opened by saying the hearing is part of efforts to \u201cdetermine whether to recommend articles of impeachment with respect to President Trump.\u201d He railed against the White House\u2019s efforts to block the testimony of two other former Trump aides \u2014 Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter \u2014 who did not show up on orders from the administration.\n\n\u201cThis is a cover-up, plain and simple,\u201d Nadler said of the White House\u2019s efforts to block testimony from Dearborn and Porter.\n\nAt another point, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee told Lewandowski, \u201cYou are obviously here to block any reasonable inquiry into the truth or not of this administration.\"\n\nLewandowski fired back that he was unable to give her a response because it wasn\u2019t a question but a \u201crant.\u201d\n\nDuring his questioning, Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson said, \u201cMr. Lewandowski, you are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to get an answer out of you.\u201d\n\nLewandowski appeared to mock California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell\u2019s unsuccessful bid for the White House earlier this year, calling him \u201cPresident Swalwell\u201d at one point during questioning. Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline suggested that the committee hold Lewandowski in contempt over his refusal to cooperate with Democratic questions.\n\nDemocrats repeatedly asked questions about Mueller\u2019s report, which said Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller's investigation. The report said Trump said that if Sessions would not meet with Lewandowski, then Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired. Lewandowski never delivered the message but asked Dearborn, a former Sessions aide, to do it. Dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and declined to deliver it, according to the report.\n\nTennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen -- who once brought a bucket of fried chicken to a hearing after Attorney General Bill Barr did not show up for it -- suggested to Lewandowski that he \u201cchickened out.\u201d During another exchange, Lewandowski replied that he did not, and claimed he went on a family vacation.\n\nIn his opening statement, Lewandowski railed against the Trump investigations.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda \u2013 to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for actual collusion or conspiracy, there was none. What there has been, however, is harassment of this president from the day he won the election.\u201d\n\nThe president was apparently watching, and tweeted: \"Such a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans mocked the hearing, with a fired-up ranking member Collins dismissing it as \u201cre-run season,\u201d saying the committee\u2019s previous hearing with Mueller didn\u2019t \u201cgo well.\u201d Collins dismissed the Democrats' effort to seek impeachment, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the votes.\u201d\n\nMueller found that there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia, but reached no conclusion on obstruction of justice. Barr later made his own decision on obstruction, saying there was insufficient evidence.\n\nAfter lawmakers finished their inquiries Tuesday, Lewandowski was questioned into the early evening by Democratic counsel Barry Berke. Republicans on the committee decried the move of bringing in Berke, who was hired as a consultant and is not on the committee staff.\n\n\u201cThis move to have private consultants question a witness during an oversight hearing is an egregious violation of the Rules of the House and pretends that the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Article I oversight authority extends to private attorneys when it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Collins said in a statement. \u201cI cannot believe that Judiciary Democrats are outsourcing their pseudo-impeachment inquiry to paid consultants.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe hearing underscores what has been a central dilemma for House Democrats all year \u2014 they have promised to investigate Trump, aggressively, and many of their base supporters want them to move quickly to try to remove him from office. But the White House has blocked their oversight requests at most every turn, declining to provide new documents or allow former aides to testify.\n\nThe Republican Senate is certain to rebuff any House efforts to bring charges against the president. And moderate Democrats in their own caucus have expressed nervousness that the impeachment push could crowd out their other accomplishments.\n\nStill, the Judiciary panel is moving ahead, approving rules for impeachment hearings last week.\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The House Judiciary Committee's first hearing as part of its\u00a0Trump impeachment investigation descended into chaos Tuesday as Democrats clashed with a combative\u00a0Corey Lewandowski, trading insults and accusations with the former Trump campaign manager, who refused to answer many of their questions.", "authors": ["Alex Pappas", "Alex Pappas Is Senior Politics Editor At Foxnews.Com."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/17/694940094001_6087149208001_6087148511001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
