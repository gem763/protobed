That\u2019s a very difficult line to walk without feeling like you\u2019re exploiting the very thing you\u2019re commenting on. Gizmodo asked the folks behind The Purge\u2019s second season how they use the show to make a statement on American violence.\n\n\u201cWe always see The Purge as kind of a cautionary tale, and so the violence that is shown is, like, we don\u2019t wanna live in this society. We\u2019re not trying to glorify it, we\u2019re trying to make it scary,\u201d executive producer Krystal Ziv told Gizmodo.\n\nThe showrunners and stars of The Purge stopped by Gizmodo's studio at New York Comic Con to chat about the sophomore season of the anthology horror series. Unlike the films in the franchise, the TV show spends time exploring what happens during the other 364 days of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s there that executive producers Ziv and James Roland said complex themes of how enacting and enabling violence truly impacts people can be explored. It\u2019s also why they don\u2019t see the series telling international stories in the near future because this is a reflection of a terrible experience that is, in the end, American.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never gonna not be an American story, I think, because sadly, I mean, it was created to be a commentary on the violence that\u2019s particularly in our society. But also, it was really about the guilt and the remorse and the regret of having enacted violence,\u201d Roland.\n\nRoland said that Ben (Joel Allen) is the character whose story impacted him the most this season. Ben is a young white man from a suburban family who goes out on Purge for the first time, and the rest of the season is about the PTSD and guilt he faces as a result of what happens. However, his experience ends up making him more violent, shining a light on young men who\u2019ve fallen into right-wing extremism and all the horrors that come with that.\n\nThere\u2019s also the story of Marcus Moore, played by Derek Luke, whose life changes forever when an assassin breaks into his home on Purge night. Luke said he decided to come on board because of how the show confronts the difficult subject of American violence head-on.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I look for as an actor is messaging, and I think it\u2019s brave to run towards commentary. I used to run from violence, but I also acknowledge I grew up around it,\u201d Luke told Gizmodo. \u201cAnd so as an actor, I run to those life lessons. Because if we don\u2019t discuss it, who else will?\u201d\n\nKrystal Ziv, writer/executive producer: A lot of fans are like, \u201cWhy is it always murder?\u201d We do get to experience what violence does to the psyche, and we see characters have to live with it.\n\nRoland: It\u2019s never gonna not be an American story, I think because sadly, I mean, it was created to be a commentary on the violence that\u2019s particularly in our society, but also, it was really about the guilt and the remorse and the regret of having enacted violence.\n\nZiv: I mean, we talk a lot about that violence begets violence, and how the Purge affects every part of your life.\n\nRoland on storyline that impacted him most: I think, for me, it\u2019s Ben, the storyline of Ben. And he\u2019s a young guy who experiences violence on Purge, and then the entire season is about the ramifications of that, the PTSD of it, and the remorse, and how that affects him psychologically and how he eventually gets more violent because of it.\n\nDerek Luke, actor (Marcus Moore): The first thing I look for as an actor is messaging, and I think it\u2019s brave to run towards commentary. I used to run from violence, but I also acknowledge I grew up around it. And so as an actor, I run to those life lessons, because if we don\u2019t discuss it, who else will?\n\nGizmodo: Nowadays we have mass shootings, we have domestic terrorism, we have big conversations happening right now, so how do you make sure this series stays entertaining for its audience, but also doesn\u2019t exploit its subject material?\n\nZiv: I mean, we always see The Purge as kind of a cautionary tale, and so the violence that is shown is like, we don\u2019t wanna live in this society. We\u2019re not trying to glorify it, we\u2019re trying to make it scary. So we\u2019re trying to explore what those elements do to people, and not just show them as acts.", "description": "The Purge is a franchise that equally indulges in patriotism and horrific violence, taking place in a country where mass shootings and domestic terrorism have become a common threat.
