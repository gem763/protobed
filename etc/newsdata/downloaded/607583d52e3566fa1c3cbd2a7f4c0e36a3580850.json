The irony is it will come via a politically expedient deal the U.S. president is expected to sign with Japan.What Trump is likely to hail with his usual superlatives will in reality be a limited agreement. It will help assuage some of the pain suffered by U.S. farmers as a result of his China trade war by opening up the lucrative Japanese market to some, but not all, American agricultural exports. It will include commitments on digital trade and tariff reductions. But much of the trade between the two countries \u2014 including importantly that of autos and auto parts \u2014 is not expected to be covered.\n\nThat last point may seem small. Yet it matters. It means the deal won\u2019t be in line with World Trade Organization rules, which require bilateral agreements between members to apply to the vast majority of trade between signatories.Such a move has consequences when it involves the world\u2019s largest and third-largest economies. When two big guns are thumbing their noses at global rules it gives license for others to do the same. And that\u2019s how order dies.The way the U.S. and Japan plan to get around that \u2014 and the anger of industries not included \u2014 is to argue this week\u2019s deal is the first installment of a comprehensive one, though there are doubts that bigger pact will ever materialize.All of this is doubly ironic because this week\u2019s \u201cmini deal\u201d is a consequence of Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of a far larger one \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which included Japan and 10 other U.S. trading partners. It will also borrow heavily from the agricultural concessions the Obama administration spent years negotiating with Japan for the TPP. The same applies to the digital provisions.When Trump took office, the promise was that he would secure new bilateral deals to replace the TPP and other larger agreements. But countries like Japan have proved reluctant. Japan chose to proceed with the TPP. It also signed a comprehensive deal with the European Union.\n\nTo eventually get Japan to the negotiating table, Trump threatened auto tariffs. That threat, though, has been paired with an urgency to help a U.S. farm sector battered by the China fight and annoyed that competitors like Australia and France have benefited from the TPP and the EU-Japan pact.\n\nThe end result: a partial deal that will leave out whole industries, undermine the global order and look a lot like parts of an agreement that Trump walked away from less than three years ago.\n\nCharting the Trade War\n\nHead-spinning uncertainty on trade is a major drag on global growth and an increasing number of central banks are responding, with the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank easing policy and the People\u2019s Bank of China likely to continue loosening. Bloomberg Economics\u2019 modeling suggests monetary easing can offset some, but not all, of the drag.\n\nToday\u2019s Must Reads\n\nPlowing ahead | China\u2019s cancellation of a planned visit to farms in the American heartland was done at the request of the U.S. as the sides intend to meet in October.\n\nNavarro in Geneva | White House trade hawk Peter Navarro will lead a delegation to Geneva to try to reform the 145-year-old global system of coordinating postal policies.\n\nBracing for Brexit | The Port of Dover, through which a sixth of the U.K.\u2019s trade in goods flows, can cope with any disruption thrown up by a no-deal Brexit, its chief executive officer said.\n\nExport slump | South Korea\u2019s export are poised for a 10th monthly slide as trade disputes and a tech downturn set the economy on a course for the slowest expansion in a decade.\n\nMade in Thailand | More Chinese manufacturers are looking to set up production in Thailand to avoid U.S. tariffs, based on demand for the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s industrial estates.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nLinking Asia | Infrastructure connectivity the reduces dependence on the U.S. is one of Asia's response to trade turmoil.\n\nJapan\u2019s slowdown | Trade war turbulence is weakening Japan\u2019s growth just before a sales-tax hike takes effect.\n\nComing Up\n\nSept. 25: CPB\u2019s monthly world trade monitor\n\nSept. 26: U.S. advanced goods trade balance for August\n\nSept. 24-30: The General Debate of the UN General Assembly\n\nLike Terms of Trade?\n\nDon\u2019t keep it to yourself.
