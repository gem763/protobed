The biggest reason I didn\u2019t pursue teaching immediately after was because I knew that, without a book, my options were limited when it came to teaching at the college level and making a living wage. So in the years prior to publishing my first collection of stories, I opted for more stable jobs that paid better than adjuncting and that\u2014despite their regular hours (in fact, because of their regularity)\u2014left me with more time and energy to write.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d heard stories from writer friends with credentials far more stunning than mine about how impossible it was to land a tenure-track position as a creative writer, so I figured, why even try? That was another big hurdle to pursuing a teaching position: this idea that it was impossible, that my work wasn\u2019t good enough to get me past even the first round of a search committee\u2019s screening.\n\nI am a first-generation college student, and the idea of becoming a professor\u2014one of those people who seemed to emanate brilliance and poise, the people who made knowledge!\u2014felt like too big of a leap for me, as someone who comes from a working-class family of electricians. Add to this the fact that the majority of my professors were white, and that most of them were male, and that most of the books they taught and deemed important enough to be covered in survey courses were written by straight white men, and you can see how a Cuban girl from Miami could come to think academia wasn\u2019t the place for her.\n\nWhen it came to having the privilege of choosing a career path, I did what people who\u2019ve internalized systemic oppression sometimes do: I aimed for something different that felt more appropriate, more attainable. I decided I\u2019d make a good high-school English teacher. I\u2019d still get to talk about books and teach people to love and value the act of writing. And I\u2019d have summers to work on all the novels and short stories I wanted to write.\n\nThen something happened that very subtly set me on a different path. What happened was that I stayed up too late one night in my dorm, and I went in on pizza with some girls on my floor, and we got to talking about what we hoped to do with our lives. Of the four other women in the room, three of them had at least one parent who was a lawyer. I was searching my brain for what they would consider the right answer, which I somehow intuited was not high-school English teacher. When they asked me, I blurted out what I thought was an appropriately upgraded version of my dream: \u201cI want to be an English professor.\u201d And the minute I said it, I knew it could be true.\n\nI genuinely did not think I was smart enough to be a professor. Even today, when I think of a professor, the image that comes to my mind is of a specific white man, James Adams, a scholar of Victorian literature who wore a for-real tweed jacket\u2014with the elbow patches and everything\u2014and who was so freaky smart and accomplished that I remember tracing my fingers over the written comments he\u2019d add at the end of my papers, hoping his brilliance would somehow transfer to me that way. But I knew when the sentence came out of my mouth that I wanted to be someone who made knowledge, who got to live in books and in theories about books, who got to spend her life writing while teaching future generations of writers how to pick apart the books they loved and discover how they were built.", "description": "My love and respect for the craft of writing fuel my commitment to teaching it.
