The chamber already passed a resolution formally opposing Trump\u2019s Syria policy, in a 354-60 vote.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if any, legislation will be taken up in the Senate, where Syria-related legislation has run into partisan landmines.\n\nSens.

But we need to think extremely carefully before we employ the same tools against a democratic NATO ally that we would against the worst rogue states,\u201d he added.\n\nMcConnell has introduced his own resolution urging President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE to halt the pullback of U.S. forces and warning that a \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d would \u201ccreate vacuums.\u201d It also urges Trump to rescind his invitation for the Turkish president to visit the White House next month and opposes Turkey\u2019s military action.\n\nBut Democrats have panned the resolution, further complicating the chances that the Senate is able to pass any legislation.\n\n\u201cTo come up with his own partisan resolution that will never see the light of day in the House, one wonders \u2026 does he care more about protecting President Trump than protecting America?\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerSchumer pushes for all-electric vehicle future by 2040 Rep. Elijah Cummings to lie in state in Capitol Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian presses Congress for paid paternity leave MORE (D-N.Y.) told reporters, referring to McConnell.\n\nGovernment funding\n\nThe Senate is continuing work on its first fiscal 2020 appropriations package.\n\nMcConnell has teed up votes on three amendments to the bill for Monday evening, including on a proposal from Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulOn The Money: Lawmakers hammer Zuckerberg over Facebook controversies | GOP chair expects another funding stopgap | Senate rejects Dem measure on SALT deduction cap workarounds Senate rejects Dem measure to overturn IRS rules on SALT deduction cap The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Diplomat's 'powerful' testimony and 'lynching' attract headlines MORE (R-Ky.) to reduce spending by two percent.\n\nThe Senate spending package merges the funding bills for Agriculture, Interior, Transportation-Housing and Urban Development and Commerce-Science-Justice.\n\nMcConnell hasn\u2019t yet moved to wrap up debate on the bill, which is expected to pass the Senate. Once the chamber finishes work on the domestic spending package, Republicans want to move to a second spending measure that would combine a mammoth defense bill and funding for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nHHS is considered a top priority for Democrats, but merging it with defense means it\u2019s unlikely to be taken up. Democrats have balked at moving defense spending without a larger agreement on top-line spending figures for each of the 12 individual appropriations bills, known as 302 B\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe need to have bipartisan support on the 302(b)s, the allocations to the various agencies, to move forward on bills like Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, military construction, and defense. That negotiation, to succeed, must be bipartisan, that\u2019s what the history of this chamber shows, that\u2019s what common sense and logic shows,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nLawmakers have until Nov. 21 to either pass each of the 12 appropriations bills or another continuing resolution (CR), which would extend funding at fiscal year 2019 levels.\n\nThe House has already passed 10 out of the 12 spending bills. Once the Senate passes its version of the legislation, they\u2019ll need to go to conference to work out their differences.\n\nBut House Democrats don\u2019t want to move a final appropriations bill until a deal has been worked out on each of the 12 government funding bills. Separating the bills, they warn, could pave the way for a repeat of 2018 when Congress had funded roughly 70 percent of the government, while the rest was impacted by a 35-day partial government shutdown.\n\nLawmakers are already publicly discussing needing another CR to prevent a shutdown next month. The options for a stopgap bill have ranged from lasting into December or even into the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cUnless a miracle happens around here with the House and Senate, we will have to put forth another CR,\u201d Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbySenators concerned impeachment will consume agenda On The Money: Lawmakers hammer Zuckerberg over Facebook controversies | GOP chair expects another funding stopgap | Senate rejects Dem measure on SALT deduction cap workarounds Shelby expects another funding stopgap, potentially through March MORE (R-Ala.) told reporters last week.\n\nShelby added that rumors of a longer CR into February or March were \u201cprobably in the ballpark.\"\n\nImpeachment inquiry\n\nThe House is slated to press on with its impeachment inquiry, with Former Deputy National Security Adviser Charles Kupperman subpoenaed to testify on Monday.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Kupperman will appear, with the former NSA official \u2014 a key witness in the probe \u2014 having filed a lawsuit in federal court on Friday asking a judge to rule on whether he can testify before the committees after the president invoked \u201cconstitutional immunity.\"\n\nNational Security Council Director for European Affairs Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Kathryn Wheelbarger, as well as State Department officials Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson have been called to appear before the committees on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, National Security Council official Tim Morrison is slated to appear before the panels. Morrison would be first White House official slated to testify.\n\n\u201cIf subpoenaed, Mr. Morrison plans to appear for his deposition,\u201d Morrison\u2019s attorney, Barbara Van Gelder, said in a statement, while declining to preview what he will say in his upcoming testimony.\n\nHouse Republicans successfully delayed a deposition after storming the SCIF last Wednesday in protest of the way Democrats have conducted the impeachment process. It\u2019s unclear whether GOP lawmakers will take action to interrupt future depositions.\n\nHealth care\n\nSenate Democrats are expected to force a vote this week on a Trump administration rule that loosens ObamaCare waiver restrictions.\n\nDemocrats are trying to roll back a rule that makes it easier for insurance plans to qualify for waivers from ObamaCare\u2019s requirements.\n\nDemocrats are able to force a vote on the Trump administration guidance under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).\n\nThe resolution, backed by every senator who caucuses with the Democrats, needs a simple majority to pass, meaning Democrats would need to pick up four GOP senators.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest effort by Senate Democrats to try to undo Trump-era regulations. They previously failed to nix a rule aimed at preventing blue states from circumventing the GOP tax law's $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as well as failing to prevent implementation of the EPA\u2019s power plant rule.\n\nArmenian genocide\n\nThe House is slated to take up a nonbinding resolution \u2014 spearheaded by Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff: Barr 'weaponizing' DOJ 'to go after the president's enemies' Top Trump administration officials hail al-Baghdadi raid but stress need for resolve in fighting ISIS Schiff: 'Bolton is a very important witness' MORE (D-Calif.) and Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) \u2014 recognizing the Ottoman Empire's genocide against the Armenian people and rejecting any efforts to enlist the U.S. Government in denying it took place.\n\n\"Genocide is not a relic of the past, but an ever present threat. Its denial is not only a continuing injury to the survivors, but makes its repetition against another people more likely,\u201d Schiff, the co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, said in a statement after its introduction.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore all the more pressing that the Congress recognize the historical fact of the Armenian Genocide and make clear that we will never be an accomplice to denial.\"\n\nBilirakis echoed Schiff sentiments, arguing Congress needs to take a stand against genocide. .\n\n\u201cGenocide must not be denied. It must be acknowledged for what it is\u2014a scourge on humanity. Official recognition of the Armenian Genocide would represent a courageous new chapter in American foreign policy. With the bold leadership of the current Administration, it is time for the United States to take a stand against Turkish genocide denial,\u201d the Florida Republican said in a statement.\n\nThe administration stopped short of recognizing Armenian Genocide earlier this year, havign released a statement in April calling it \u201cone of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nEnvironment bills\n\nThe House is scheduled to take up three environmental bills this week.\n\nThe Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act \u2014 led by House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) \u2013 aims to ban uranium mining around the Grand Canyon.
