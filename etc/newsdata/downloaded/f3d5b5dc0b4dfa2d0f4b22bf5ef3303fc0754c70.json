But it was deemed necessary for smooth trade from North to South.\n\nWhen the proposal was sent back to London for approval, however, it hit a snag.\n\nThe Vote Leave campaign had pledged to scrap the five per cent VAT that the EU levies on sanitary products. Under the proposed deal, the PM would be unable to keep that pledge in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt took two personal phone calls at 9.30am and 11am from Boris Johnson to European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to agree a special 'derogation' for sanitary products\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier was not impressed. He did not mention the issue directly, but told EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday night that the talks were stuck on a dispute about VAT.\n\nBy 2am yesterday, the sides could still not settle the issue and broke up. It took two personal phone calls at 9.30am and 11am from Boris Johnson to European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to agree a special 'derogation' for sanitary products.\n\nDay that put a smile on Dominic Cummings' face Dominic Cummings cheerfully peeking out from behind a wall He's frequently characterised as a snarling attack-dog only too happy to clamp down on Boris Johnson's Brexit enemies. But even the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings was swept up in the optimism \u2013 as he cheerfully peeked out from behind a wall to snap the scene in Brussels yesterday.\n\nAn hour later, the final text of a deal \u2013 which critics said was impossible \u2013 was published.\n\nIt was a remarkable transformation from a month earlier, when Tory rebels joined forces with Labour to push through legislation apparently taking the threat of No Deal on October 31 off the table.\n\nThe passage of the so-called Surrender Act, which requires the PM to seek an extension if he cannot get a deal through by Saturday, had knocked negotiations for six.\n\nBut the legislation also helped galvanise the Prime Minister. Downing Street stuck to the line that the UK was leaving on October 31. Privately, aides quickly concluded that there was no certain way to circumvent the law.\n\nBy late September, the Prime Minister had concluded that the only way he could keep his 'do or die' pledge was by cutting a deal.\n\nSumming up his predicament, the PM told allies that Remainer MPs 'think they've got me locked in a casket at the bottom of the Mariana Trench'. But he added: 'I'm not sure they've read the situation quite right.'\n\nWork began on an audacious scheme to solve the border problem by allowing customs checks in the Irish Sea \u2013 an idea Mr Johnson had branded unacceptable and was certain to infuriate the DUP.\n\nIn a bruising phone call, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Mr Johnson he would never get a deal unless he agreed to effectively leave Northern Ireland in the EU 'forever'. But Mr Johnson was determined to give it one last go.\n\nHe met Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at a 'neutral' location \u2013 the 19th century Thornton Manor on the Wirral \u2013 for a private chat.\n\nIn a bruising phone call, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Mr Johnson he would never get a deal unless he agreed to effectively leave Northern Ireland in the EU 'forever'. But Mr Johnson was determined to give it one last go\n\nAfter 90 minutes, the outline of a grand bargain had been struck.\n\nMr Varadkar agreed to drop the backstop and accepted Northern Ireland could leave the customs union. In return, the PM accepted Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the single market for goods and there could be no return to customs checks at the border.\n\nPound jumps as business chiefs push for certainty Business leaders last night urged MPs to back Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and lift the fog of uncertainty hanging over the economy. As the pound headed for its best six-day run against the dollar since 1985, industry chiefs welcomed the Prime Minister's agreement with the EU. Sterling rose more than 1 per cent against the dollar to a five-month high of $1.2988 in the minutes after the deal was announced. That took gains since Mr Johnson's meeting with Irish PM Leo Varadkar last week to 6 per cent. But sterling retreated as low as $1.2765 at one point amid fears MPs might block the deal. The City of London Corporation's Catherine McGuinness urged 'all those involved in the process to put an end to the sustained uncertainty that has left business with its hands tied'. And Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce warned: 'There is still a long way to go before businesses can confidently plan for the future.'\n\nA million details remained to be thrashed out.\n\nBut, with the Irish happy, the EU was finally willing to engage. There then followed days of talks, with officials negotiating in parallel in several rooms to get a deal done.\n\nAt one point this week, a British official in Brussels was sent out to buy new shirts for the team.\n\nMr Barnier yesterday acknowledged the Wirral summit was the 'turning point'. But as the Taoiseach grew happier, the grumpier the DUP became.\n\nBy Wednesday evening it became clear that the DUP's resistance ran deep \u2013 and Mr Johnson took the momentous decision to press ahead with a deal without them.\n\nAllies of the PM fear the loss of the DUP could make it impossible for him to get it through Parliament when MPs vote tomorrow.\n\nBut Mr Johnson was bullish when he briefed EU leaders last night. One source said: 'He told them, 'It's good to see you all and I will be happy not to see you again.' It was funny and they all knew what he meant.\n\n'He was implying, 'Let's get this done.'", "description": "After days of intense talks - covering everything from visas and law enforcement to tariffs - exhausted negotiators in Brussels were left with one outstanding problem: The so-called 'Tampon Tax'.", "authors": ["Jason Groves", "David Churchill For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19862120-0-image-a-37_1571353966902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
