And while it takes two to tango, Moira sees Nate as the epicentre of the disaster which has ripped her life apart and she grabs a shotgun, pointing it directly at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNate has turned up at the farm to try and make amends and explain to Moira that she was never his target but it\u2019s fair to say that his arrival in the village has been the catalyst for everything being destroyed.\n\nAs Nate tries to get her to see sense, hatred and rage fill her eyes as she contemplates pulling the trigger. Is she set to kill Nate in revenge tonight?
