This would be a sad misunderstanding.\n\nSad because Draghi\u2019s legacy should be centered on his courageous action to save the euro zone (along with the common currency that symbolizes ever closer European economic and social integration), and misleading because the policy differences at issue have less to do with the ECB than with what little European policymakers have done to support the economy.\n\nWhen asked at his September 12th press conference about the process leading to the ECB\u2019s latest set of policy decisions, Draghi said no vote of approval had been required because there had been a \u201cclear majority\u201d in favor of the actions taken. Subsequent revelations suggested that this may have been a less-than-comprehensive answer.\n\nMore detailed reporting suggested that 10 of the 25 decision makers had issues with some elements. And several of the dissenters \u2014 who together represent more than half of the euro zone\u2019s GDP \u2014 have taken the unusual step of publicly expressing their opposition. In addition, last week, Sabine Lautenschlager, a German on the bank\u2019s executive board, resigned, and news reports said she did so over sharp differences with Draghi.\n\nThe political backlash is sure to intensify in the days and weeks ahead. After all, who will forget the front cover of Bild, the popular German tabloid, portraying the ECB president as \u201cCount Draghi\u201d for sucking interest income from German savers with his \u201cQE infinity\u201d and negative policy rates.\n\nSuch are the increasing costs and risks of relying on the ECB alone to improve the European economy. Slowing economic growth and the rising risk of outright recession only render the situation more treacherous. But this should not detract attention from Draghi\u2019s important accomplishments \u2014 and not only because it would be unfair. It would also mislead Europe about what policy actions are needed going forward.\n\nRecall the existential risk the euro zone faced seven years ago as it grappled with a deepening debt crisis. On July 26, 2012, Draghi took to the stage during a London conference organized by the U.K. government. I was sitting in the audience to his left and remember the impact of his asserting that the ECB was \u201cready to do whatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d he insisted, \u201cit will be enough.\u201d\n\nHis remarks turned out to be a pivotal. They acted as a circuit breaker for what was an increasingly vicious cycle of financial dislocations tearing at the fabric of the monetary union. Draghi\u2019s words enabled the euro zone to reset and laid the foundation for broader policy strengthening. Unfortunately, policymakers outside the central bank failed to follow suit.\n\nDraghi\u2019s comments were more a bold personal effort than a collective decision by the ECB Governing Council. After speaking, he went back for his ECB colleagues\u2019 support, which some were initially reluctant to give. In this way, Draghi managed to stabilize the situation without costing the ECB a single euro.\n\nAnother big challenge was yet to come. Europe still lacked a complete banking union and any proper fiscal integration. Member countries continued to do little to carry out pro-growth structural reforms, or couple monetary policy with budget stimulus.\n\nDraghi was the one senior European policymaker who consistently urged a more comprehensive approach. In the past year he has gone out of his way at every press conference to make the case for structural reforms and selective fiscal expansion, and for completing the euro zone\u2019s economic and financial architecture. His words have repeatedly fallen on deaf ears.\n\nWith the ECB having little choice but to continue its unconventional measures, it was only a matter of time before excessive reliance on them threatened to do more harm than good. It\u2019s no wonder that differences within the ECB have become harder to manage internally, and harder to contain externally.\n\nDraghi should not be blamed for this. Rather, the month leading to his departure from the ECB should be a time of reflection on Europe\u2019s need for courageous economic leadership. A comprehensive policy approach is still needed to enable high and inclusive growth, and genuine financial stability.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Given last week\u2019s news of grumbling among members of the European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council and the resignation of a board member, it seems\u00a0Mario Draghi\u2019s last month as president might be marred by internal policy divisions.
