I felt this was possible,\u201d Robinson told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was all good. I just tried to keep it as tight as possible and I think I\u2019ve done that well.\u201d\n\nThe 17-year-old Robinson won the junior world title in GS in February and left her mark at the World Cup Finals the following month, when she finished runner-up to Shiffrin in the last race of the season.\n\n\u201cI think I proved that wasn\u2019t a one-off so I am happy with that,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nShiffrin, who won the GS season title for the first time last year, awed her rivals with a free-flowing run. She significantly extended her advantage over then-leader Tessa Worley, who won the race last year, with every split time, up to 1.24 seconds.\n\nSlovenia\u2019s Meta Hrovat was the only other skier to finish within a second of Shiffrin\u2019s lead. Petra Vlhova, regarded as Shiffrin\u2019s biggest rival for the overall title, had 1.47 to make up in the second run.\n\nIt was Shiffrin\u2019s eighth start in the traditional season curtain raiser on the Rettenback glacier. She has won the event once \u2014 five years ago, when she shared victory with Anna Veith for her first of 10 career wins in the discipline.\n\nIf Shiffrin holds on to her lead, she would celebrate her 61st World Cup win, moving her within one victory of Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proell in fourth place on the all-time race winners\u2019 list.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "SOELDEN, Austria (AP) \u2014 Mikaela Shiffrin posted the fastest first-run time in the World Cup season-opening giant slalom on Saturday, but was sharing the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/3e9623_aptopix-austria-alpine-skiing-world-cup-07731-united-states-mikaela-shiffrin-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
