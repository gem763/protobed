Yet even as thousands died, the coroners\u2019 pleas were met largely with silence.\n\n\u201cFor what it is worth, I add my voice to the chorus pleading for urgency,\u201d Western Australia coroner Barry King wrote in his report, delivered in May.\n\nHalf a world away, Australia has failed to heed the lessons of the United States, and is now facing skyrocketing rates of opioid prescriptions and related deaths. Drug companies facing scrutiny for their aggressive marketing of opioids in America have turned their focus abroad, working around marketing regulations to push the painkillers in other countries. And as with the U.S., Australia\u2019s government has also been slow to respond to years of warnings from worried health experts.\n\nIn dozens of interviews, doctors, researchers and Australians whose lives have been upended by opioids described a plight that now stretches from coast to coast. Australia\u2019s death rate from opioids has more than doubled in just over a decade. And health experts worry that without urgent action, Australia is on track for an even steeper spike in deaths like those seen in America, where the epidemic has left 400,000 dead.\n\n\u201cIf only Australia could understand how quickly this can get out of hand. We\u2019re not immune to it,\u201d says Jasmin Raggam, whose brother Jon died in 2014 of an opioid overdose and whose brother-in-law is now addicted to the opioid OxyContin. \u201cI was screaming from the mountaintops after Jon died and I\u2019d started doing my research. And it was like I\u2019m screaming and nobody wants to hear me.\u201d\n\nOn an island off the coast of Tasmania, Dr. Bastian Seidel and his colleagues are immersed in what he calls a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d Two years ago, when he was president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Seidel dubbed Australia\u2019s opioid problem a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d Today, he wonders if anyone was listening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s depressing at times to see how we, as practitioners, literally messed up our communities,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s our signature on the scripts. \u2026 But the pressure being put on by the drug companies, by certain health sectors - that\u2019s the situation that we are facing now.\u201d\n\nAustralia knows the extent of the problem, he says. The country knows addiction is devastating its communities. And yet, he says, nobody is doing anything.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in Australia, we\u2019ve followed the bad example of the U.S.,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now we have the same problem.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAUSTRALIA\u2018S OPIOID ADDICTION\n\nOpioids were once reserved for treating pain that was short-term, terminal or related to cancer. But in the 1990s, pharmaceutical companies began aggressively marketing them for chronic pain.\n\nStarting in 2000, Australia began approving and subsidizing certain opioids for use in chronic, non-cancer pain. Those approvals coincided with a spike in opioid consumption, which nearly quadrupled between 1990 and 2014, says Sydney University researcher Emily Karanges.\n\nDr. Jennifer Stevens, a pain specialist, saw the surge with startling clarity while working at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Sydney.\n\nA few years ago, a pharmacist at the hospital told her they needed to hire an extra person just to handle all the prescriptions they were handing out for Endone, a brand of oxycodone. Stevens discovered that the hospital\u2019s Endone prescriptions had increased 500 percent in 8 years, with no decrease in other opioids dispensed. Further study revealed that 10 percent of patients were still taking opioids three months after surgery, even though the drugs are generally only recommended for short-term use.\n\n\u201cWe were just pumping this stuff out into our local community, thinking that that had no consequences,\u201d says Stevens, a vocal advocate for changing opioid prescribing practices. \u201cAnd now, of course, we realize that it does have huge consequences.\u201d\n\nJust like in the U.S., as opioid prescriptions rose, so did fatal overdoses. Opioid-related deaths jumped from 439 in 2006 to 1,119 in 2016 \u2014 a rise of 2.2 to 4.7 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Most of those deaths were related to prescription opioids, rather than illegal opioids such as heroin.\n\nMore than 3 million Australians - an eighth of the country\u2019s population - are getting at least one opioid prescription a year, according to the latest data.\n\nThe numbers and the warnings may have been glossed over partly because of Australia\u2019s piecemeal system of data collection and reporting, says Dr. Christian Rowan, an addiction specialist in the state of Queensland. Data is reported by various states, coroners and agencies, and often includes only prescriptions filled through the government-subsidized drug system and not private prescriptions.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s fragmented, people haven\u2019t had a line of sight as to what\u2019s happening,\u201d he says.\n\nAustralia\u2019s government insists it is now taking the problem seriously. The opioid codeine, which used to be available over the counter, was restricted to prescription-only in 2018. And last month, the country\u2019s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, announced tougher opioid regulations, including restricting the use of fentanyl patches to patients with cancer, in palliative care, or under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for the past,\u201d says Greg Hunt, who became the federal Health Minister in 2017. \u201cI can speak for my watch and my time where this has been one of my absolute priorities, which is why we\u2019ve taken such strong steps. \u2026 My focus has been to make sure that we don\u2019t have an American-style crisis.\u201d\n\nBut for Sue Fisher, whose 21-year-old son Matthew died in 2010 of an overdose, it\u2019s too little, too late. The crisis is here, along with what she calls a \u201ccrisis of ignorance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a country that is oblivious to what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we learning from America\u2019s mistakes? Why don\u2019t we learn?\u201d\n\n___\n\nTHE DRUG COMPANIES\n\nWhen Rustie Lassam thinks of the drug companies that pumped opioids into Australia\u2019s market, she thinks of her infant son\u2019s agonized wails as he went through withdrawal.\n\nFor years, doctors had told her that opioids would help her back pain, which led to an all-consuming addiction. During her pregnancy, she swallowed nine high-dose OxyContin tablets every day. So when she thinks about the way pharmaceutical companies have marketed those drugs to doctors, she weeps with rage and grief.\n\n\u201cIf only they knew what addiction did to people, how really it affects us to the very core of who we are,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there they are, making all this money off the back of my broken life.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., drug companies such as OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma are facing more than 2,000 lawsuits accusing them of overstating the benefits of opioids, downplaying their addictiveness and encouraging doctors to prescribe the drugs to more patients in higher amounts.\n\nIn Australia, pharmaceutical companies by law cannot directly advertise to consumers, but are free to market the drugs to medical professionals. And they have done so, aggressively and effectively, by sponsoring swanky conferences, running doctors\u2019 training seminars, funding research papers, giving money to pain advocacy groups and meeting with doctors to push the drugs for chronic pain.\n\n\u201cIf the relevant governing bodies had ensured that the way the product was being marketed to doctors especially was different, I don\u2019t necessarily think we would see what we\u2019re seeing now,\u201d says Bee Mohamed, who until recently was the CEO of ScriptWise, a group devoted to reducing prescription drug deaths in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to undo ten years of what marketing has unfortunately done.\u201d\n\nMundipharma, the international arm of Purdue, has received particular criticism for its marketing tactics in Australia. In 2018, addiction specialist Dr. Simon Holliday filed a complaint against the company over a marketing pamphlet for its drug Targin, a painkiller designed to prevent the constipation that is common with other opioids.\n\nThe brochure cited 2009 guidance from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners that says weak opioids are less effective than strong ones. But in a statement, the doctors\u2019 group said the ad was misleading and that Mundipharma appeared to have deliberately ignored its updated clinical guidelines.\n\nHolliday filed a complaint with Medicines Australia, the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s regulator. But membership to Medicines Australia is not mandatory, and Mundipharma declined to participate in the complaints process because it had dropped out as a member.\n\nHolliday then went to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. He got nowhere. So he wrote to Hunt, the health minister, and other lawmakers. He received no response.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, Mundipharma said that the guidelines it referenced were current at the time the pamphlet was in circulation. \u201cThe material was balanced, accurate, fully supported by the product information, consistent with the approved indication, and contained adequate safety information,\u201d the company said.\n\nThis year, Mundipharma has faced scrutiny over a promotional campaign that critics say violates the spirit of Australia\u2019s law banning drug marketing to consumers.\n\nThe campaign, which encouraged people suffering painkiller-induced constipation to talk to their doctors, never mentions Targin by name, because it legally can\u2019t. But the advertising agency Mundipharma hired described on its website how they worked around that regulation, by using print, radio and online ads to target regions where pain medication use was high. Google search data showed that people looking for information on constipation from painkillers used terms like \u201cblocked up,\u201d so the agency used the phrase \u201cblocked pipes.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Mundipharma said the campaign was a \u201cdisease awareness initiative\u201d that did not violate the spirit of any law and did not market any medication.\n\nIn an interview, Hunt said he has asked the country\u2019s drug regulator, the TGA, to investigate both marketing campaigns, along with some of Mundipharma\u2019s other activities in Australia. Among those activities: the company\u2019s \u201cPain Management Master Classes\u201d for doctors. The classes, which have provided training to more than 5,000 doctors in Australia, have been praised by some as helpful for physicians seeking guidance on treating complex pain, and condemned by others as a conflict of interest, given they are run by a company that sells painkillers.\n\nMundipharma said the classes cover non-opioid treatment options and \u201cstrongly emphasize\u201d that opioids are only appropriate after a comprehensive assessment.\n\nStevens, the Sydney pain specialist, has pushed back against several drug companies over their marketing tactics. A couple years ago, she says, Mundipharma was marketing Targin to surgeons at her hospital, reassuring them that they could prescribe higher doses. Unlike pain specialists, surgeons are generally not well-educated on the intricacies of opioids, she says.\n\nStevens complained to Mundipharma and they stopped the practice. She says they have become much more cooperative since.\n\n\u201cMarketing, on the whole, is very clever and very successful - otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be done,\u201d she says. \u201cWe love a freebie. \u2026 We\u2019re no different from other members of the population. It\u2019s just that we are targeted more.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Mundipharma said it strictly adheres to the Medicines Australia code of conduct and has always been transparent about the risks associated with opioids. Still, in a submission last year to the TGA as it considered tougher restrictions on opioids, Mundipharma appeared to minimize the severity of Australia\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that there is an issue associated with opioid misuse,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cHowever to describe the Australian situation as a \u2018crisis\u2019 is alarmist and risks stigmatizing patients who have a legitimate need for opioid analgesics to manage their pain.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHOW THE GOVERNMENT FELL SHORT\n\nDavid Tonkin blames his son\u2019s death on a system that allowed him to see 24 doctors and get 23 different medications from 16 pharmacies - all in the space of six months. Between January and July 2014 alone, Matthew Tonkin got 27 prescriptions just for oxycodone.\n\nThe addiction that ultimately ended Matthew\u2019s life began in 2012, after he was injured while serving with the Australian army in Afghanistan. When the 22-year-old arrived on leave at his father\u2019s home in the western Australian city of Perth, he held up a stack of OxyContin pill strips. The drugs had been prescribed to him by American doctors in Afghanistan for his injured hip and ankle.\n\n\u201cLook, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Yanks really know how to look after you.\u201d\n\nMatthew was 14 kilograms (30 pounds) lighter than the last time his father had seen him. He was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from the horrors of Afghanistan, including the death of his best friend, a fellow soldier. He was also suffering from a growing addiction to opioids. The addiction escalated after the army sent him to recover in Queensland, where doctors put him on an opioid called tramadol.\n\nMatthew soon discovered how easy it was to get whatever prescriptions he wanted. He forged his doctor\u2019s signature. He told one doctor he\u2019d knocked a bottle of pills into the toilet and needed more.\n\nIn August 2013, another doctor prescribed him more oxycodone after Matthew said he was suffering from PTSD and hip pain.\n\nA few weeks later, Matthew had his first oxycodone overdose. A few months after that, he was discharged from the army.\n\nOne doctor called a hotline for medical professionals to report Matthew\u2019s apparent misuse of prescription drugs. But when Matthew moved back to Perth to live with David, doctors there had no way of knowing his drug use had been flagged in Queensland.\n\nHe hopped around clinics collecting prescriptions for opioids. The doctors were largely oblivious to what he was doing because Australia has no national, real-time prescription tracking system.\n\nDavid begged Matthew\u2019s doctors and pharmacists to stop giving him OxyContin. Matthew just went to other doctors.\n\nAt a solemn gathering to honor military personnel on April 25, 2014, two of Matthew\u2019s friends had to hold him upright.\n\nBack at home after the service, David told Matthew to hand over his pills. Matthew shoved David across the kitchen into the cupboard. Then he pinned his father to the floor and began to choke him.\n\nDavid thought he was going to die.\n\nMatthew eventually let go and both men went to the hospital for treatment. Two days later, Matthew called his father. \u201cDo you still love me, Dad?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd of course, he did. So David kept trying to save him, right up until July 3, 2014, when he returned home from a walk and realized Matthew hadn\u2019t come out of his room all morning.\n\nThe night before, Matthew had been sick. David had cleaned the vomit off his son\u2019s bedroom floor and changed his sheets. Matthew took a shower, thanked his father and climbed into bed.\n\nDavid walked into his son\u2019s room. \u201cTime to get up, mate.\u201d\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nDavid placed a hand on Matthew. His body was warm. But he had no pulse.\n\nDavid called for an ambulance and started CPR. As he pumped his son\u2019s chest, the dispatcher counted out the beats.\n\nOne. Two. Three. Four.\n\nNothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.\n\nFive. Six. Seven. Eight.\n\nNothing.\n\n___\n\nWARNINGS IGNORED\n\nThe conclusion from King, the coroner, was blunt: Had a prescription tracking system been in place, Matthew would not have been given the oxycodone that killed him.\n\nKing\u2019s findings on Matthew\u2019s death were delivered at least a dozen years after the first coroners\u2019 reports began warning of a growing opioid problem. As early as 2007, a coroner had suggested that someone look into why the opioid prescription rate on the island of Tasmania was so high.\n\nTwo states - Tasmania and Victoria - developed their own prescription tracking systems, but they only monitor opioid prescriptions within their respective states, and neither is currently mandatory.\n\nThe development of a national system has been mired in bureaucratic delays. In 2017, the government committed 16 million Australian dollars (US$11 million) to creating one, and Hunt, the health minister, later said it would be ready by the end of 2018. It has yet to be rolled out.\n\nIn an interview, Hunt blamed the delay on the states. The national framework is ready, he said, but the states must connect to it.\n\nIn March 2019, New South Wales coroner Harriet Grahame warned that Australia\u2019s opioid deaths could reach many thousands over the next five years.\n\n\u201cWe appear to have few coordinated strategies to address this problem,\u201d Grahame wrote in a report. \u201cLowering the rate of opioid overdose is clearly achievable but it will require a government willing to listen to health experts and to act decisively on their advice.\u201d\n\nAfter Matthew died, and for years to come, David would suddenly awaken at 10 p.m. - the same time that Matthew used to call from Afghanistan. Now, instead of his son\u2019s voice, there is only silence.\n\n___\n\nTHE POOR PAY THE PRICE\n\nFrom her home in rural northwest Tasmania, 51-year-old Carmall Casey seethes over a system she says pushed her and so many others into addiction. It is a system that has made opioids the cheap and easy alternative for Australians, particularly the poor.\n\n\u201cI became an addict without knowing,\u201d Casey says.\n\nHere in Tasmania, there are echoes of American Appalachia - in the rural towns, the poverty and the cascade of lives torn apart by pills that promised to take away the pain but in the end created more.\n\nThis is Australia\u2019s poorest state, and like Appalachia, it is the country\u2019s epicenter for opioids. Tasmania has the nation\u2019s highest rate of opioid packs sold per person - 2.7 each. One region has the highest number of government-subsidized opioid prescriptions in Australia: more than 110,000 for every 100,000 people.\n\nTen years ago, while working as a dairy farmer, Casey jumped off a truck and felt her knees give way. An operation provided temporary relief, but the pain came back. She was told she had osteoarthritis.\n\nA doctor prescribed her opioids to ease her pain. When she stuck the first patch on her skin, it felt like heaven.\n\nBut the agony eventually returned, so the doctor upped the dosage. The side effects were hell - depression, anxiety, panic attacks. And her pain got worse.\n\nDesperate, she saw other doctors. They sent her away with more prescriptions for more opioids: fentanyl, codeine, oxycodone, tramadol, buprenorphine, tapentadol, Targin.\n\nAn estimated 20% of Australians suffer chronic pain. But in poor, rural areas, access to pain specialists can be logistically and financially difficult. Wait lists are long, and a few sessions with a physiotherapist can cost hundreds of dollars. Under the government-subsidized prescription benefit plan, a pack of opioids costs as little as AU$6.50 ($4.50.)\n\nDr. Tim Andrewartha, a general practitioner in northwest Tasmania, says giving a patient with chronic pain a drug for quick comfort can be tempting, when the alternative may be a years-long wait to see a specialist.\n\n\u201cAs a medical practice, we\u2019re just falling short in terms of acknowledging the lack of evidence that these drugs have for chronic, long-term use,\u201d he says.\n\nCasey couldn\u2019t afford private health insurance, so finding a surgeon who would treat the cause of her pain was a struggle. She drove ten hours roundtrip to meet a surgeon in the capital, Hobart, only to be told the wait list for the operation was two years.\n\nWhile taking a truck driving course, she injured her shoulder and began the same carousel of fruitless doctors\u2019 appointments.\n\nShe tried to quit the painkillers. She returned them to the pharmacy and dumped them down the sink. She suffered through the nightmares and shakes of withdrawal. But eventually, the pain would grow unbearable, so she\u2019d take the drugs again.\n\nShe lost her farm. Even worse, she says, she lost her daughter.\n\nShe made bad choices on the drugs, she admits now. She was living with a volatile man who began to bully Sarah, so she sent her daughter, then 14, to live with her father. It\u2019s a decision that tore them apart, and still tears Casey apart today.\n\nOne day, she scrawled her anguish on a tattered envelope. \u201cImagine having a toothache for weeks, months 1 year, 2 years, 3, 4, and it\u2019s still aching now \u2026 the pain eats away at you, the drugs send you crazy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn June, she told herself: Enough. She returned the remaining pills to her pharmacist.\n\nShe found a surgeon who took her seriously. And she got an appointment with a physiotherapist who is teaching her exercises to manage her pain.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, she rifles through a box of medicine in her kitchen. Suddenly, she freezes. Tucked inside is an old pack of tapentadol that she thought she\u2019d thrown away. She washes the pills down the kitchen sink.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do when the pain returns. But she says she will never return to opioids.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going back,\u201d she says and begins to weep. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThe AP\u2019s reporting on the global opioid crisis is supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.
