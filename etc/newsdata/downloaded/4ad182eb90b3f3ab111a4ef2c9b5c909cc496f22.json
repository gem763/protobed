During the call, McDermott stressed that his decision to step down was very much a personal one, and that while he\u2019s not ready to retire just yet, he simply believes that now is the right time for him to pass on the reins of the company.\n\nTo say that today\u2019s news came as a surprise is a bit of an understatement, but it seems like it\u2019s something McDermott has been thinking about for a while. But after talking to McDermott, Morgan and Klein, I can\u2019t help but think that the actual decision came rather recently.\n\nI last spoke to McDermott about a month ago, during a fireside chat at our TechCrunch Sessions: Enterprise event. At the time, I didn\u2019t come away with the impression that this was a CEO on his way out (though McDermott reminded me that if he had already made up his decision a month ago, he probably wouldn\u2019t have given it away anyway).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to make decisions. That\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m known for,\u201d he told me when I asked him about how the process unfolded. \u201cThis one, I did a lot of deep soul searching. I really did think about it very heavily \u2014 and I know that it\u2019s the right time and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so happy. When you can make decisions from a position of strength, you\u2019re always happy.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that he has been with SAP for 17 years, with almost 10 years as CEO, and that he recently spent some time talking to fellow high-level CEOs.\n\n\u201cThe consensus was 10 years is about the right amount of time for a CEO because you\u2019ve accomplished a lot of things if you did the job well, but you certainly didn\u2019t stay too long. And if you did really well, you had a fantastic success plan,\u201d he said.\n\nIn \u201cthe recent past,\u201d McDermott met with SAP chairman and co-founder Hasso Plattner to explain to him that he wouldn\u2019t renew his contract. According to McDermott, both of them agreed that the company is currently at \u201cmaximum strength\u201d and that this would be the best time to put the succession plan into action.\n\n\u201cWith the continuity of Jennifer and Christian obviously already serving on the board and doing an unbelievable job, we said let\u2019s control our destiny. I\u2019m not going to renew, and these are the two best people for the job without question. Then they\u2019ll get a chance to go to Capital Markets Day [in November]. Set that next phase of our growth story. Kick off the New Year \u2014 and do so with a clean slate and a clean run to the finish line.\n\n\u201cVery rarely do CEOs get the joy of handing over a company at maximum strength. And today is a great day for SAP. It\u2019s a great day for me personally and Hasso Plattner, the chairman and [co-]founder of SAP. And also \u2014 and most importantly \u2014 a great day for Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect for McDermott to just fade into the background, though, now that he is leaving SAP. If you\u2019ve ever met or seen McDermott speak, you know that he\u2019s unlikely to simply retire. \u201cI\u2019m busy. I\u2019m passionate and I\u2019m just getting warmed up,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the new leadership, Morgan and Klein noted that they hadn\u2019t had a lot of time to think about the strategy going forward. Both previously held executive positions in the company and served on SAP\u2019s board together for the last few years. For now, it seems, they are planning on continuing on a similar path as McDermott.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about creating a renewed focus on the engineering DNA of SAP, combining the amazing strength and heritage of SAP \u2014 and many of the folks who have built the products that so many customers around the world run today \u2014 with a new DNA that\u2019s come in from many of the cloud acquisitions that we\u2019ve made,\u201d Morgan said, noting that both she and Klein spent a lot of time over the last few months bringing their teams together in new ways. \u201cSo I think for us, that tapestry of talent and that real sense of urgency and support of our customers and innovation is top of mind for us.\u201d\n\nKlein also stressed that he believes SAP\u2019s current strategy is the right one. \u201cWe had unbelievable deals again in Q3 where we actually combined our latest innovations \u2014 where we combined Qualtrics with SuccessFactors with S/4 [Hana] to drive unbelievable business value for our customers. This is the way to go. The business case is there. I see a huge shift now towards S/4, and the core and business case is there, supporting new business models, driving automation, steering the company in real time. All of these assets are now coming together with our great cloud assets, so for me, the strategy works.\u201d\n\nHaving co-CEOs can be a recipe for conflict, but McDermott started out as co-CEO with Plattner, so the company does have some experience there. Morgan and Klein noted that they worked together on the SAP board before and know each other quite well.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the new CEOs? \u201cThere has to be a huge focus on Q4,\u201d Klein said. \u201cAnd then, of course, we will continue like we did in the past. I\u2019ve known Jen now for quite a while \u2014 there was a lot of trust there in the past and I\u2019m really now excited to really move forward together with her and driving huge business outcomes for our customers. And let\u2019s not forget our employees. Our employee morale is at an all-time high. And we know how important that is to our employees. We definitely want that to continue.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine SAP with McDermott, but we\u2019ve clearly not seen the last of him yet. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw him pop up as the CEO of another company soon.\n\nBelow is my interview with McDermott from TechCrunch Sessions: Enterprise.", "description": "SAP\u2019s CEO Bill McDermott today announced that he wouldn\u2019t seek to renew his contract for the next year and step down immediately after nine years at the helm of the German enterprise giant.
