Either Trump has finally lost the plot or else he has just guaranteed himself a stunning victory in next year\u2019s presidential election. Whichever view is correct, both signal a rising sea of troubles for the US and the world.\n\nSuggestions that Trump has no idea what he\u2019s doing were reinforced by some unhinged behaviour last week. His ranting about traitors, spies and low-life at a White House event was utterly bizarre, reviving claims that he is unfit for office.\n\nEchoes of the Nixon tapes? The transcripts that could doom Trump Read more\n\nAs usual, Trump has turned defence into offence, in every sense. But his bullish tactics staggered Washington. Instead of apologising, he freely admitted asking Ukraine\u2019s president for help in undermining Joe Biden, a leading Democratic election rival. Nor did he deny seeking personal political favours from leaders in Australia, Italy and Britain. He vowed to ask the same of China.\n\nIt was an extraordinary display of chutzpah that doubtless delighted many Republicans. But it still looked crazy, given that Trump is brazenly breaking the law. \u201cIt is illegal for any person to solicit, accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election,\u201d said Ellen Weintraub, head of the Federal Election Commission. \u201cI would not have thought that I needed to say this.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s defiance is problematic in numerous other ways. Making America\u2019s international relations dependent on private quid pro quos \u2013 in Ukraine\u2019s case $391m in military aid and a high-profile White House meeting were allegedly dangled as carrots \u2013 is a road to ruin. It amounts to extortion, and invites foreign leaders to behave corruptly, too. As their published texts show, US diplomats saw the danger, in effect, of putting US foreign policy up for sale.\n\nBy covertly seeking favours for political advantage, Trump presented US allies with an invidious choice: do as he asked, or risk negative consequences in key policy areas. In Britain\u2019s case, non-compliance could entail problems with a post-Brexit trade deal. There is no proof this happened. But that\u2019s the point. Reports last week that Trump personally sought Boris Johnson\u2019s help to discredit the Mueller inquiry into his Russia links have not been denied.\n\nAmerica\u2019s rivals are not immune from such mafiosi-style arm-twisting. Trump openly suggested that progress in trade talks with China next week could depend on Beijing\u2019s agreement to investigate what he claims, without proof, were corrupt actions by Biden and his son, Hunter. If it were to agree, what might China ask in return? US silence on human rights abuses in Hong Kong perhaps?\n\nHe is prepared to obstruct justice, intimidate witnesses, peddle lies, demonise the media, whip up populist hysteria\n\nWhether he realises it or not, Trump has lit a fuse connected to an Oval Office bomb. The move to impeach began after details of his phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president leaked. It has since emerged that transcripts and notes of his phone conversations with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, among others, are also held in a classified White House archive. What private deals may he have cut with them? It\u2019s only a matter of time before Congress subpoenas these records too.\n\nSo is Trump\u2019s goose cooked? Not necessarily. For starters, he displays a ruthless, killer instinct his more well-mannered Democrat accusers appear to lack. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, resisted impeachment for months. Now she talks not of her fury but of her sadness that it has come to this. This lack of Watergate-style fire and brimstone partly reflects Democratic doubts about Biden, who carries a lot of baggage.\n\nSuch self-doubt is wholly foreign to Trump, whose determination to vanquish his accusers and secure a second term knows no limit. As he has already shown, he is fully prepared to obstruct justice, intimidate witnesses, peddle lies, demonise the media, whip up populist hysteria \u2013 and, allegedly, fix the 2020 election, just like in 2016.\n\n\u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Trump tweeted last week. In his mind, untroubled by ethical, legal or constitutional principles, or any sense of shame, his actions are wholly justified.\n\nTrump and his supporters plainly believe impeachment will backfire. They think claims he explicitly demanded quid pro quos from Ukraine and others cannot ultimately be proven. They will obstruct demands for more witness testimony and transcripts. They will step up mendacious TV ad campaigns vilifying the Bidens. And they will argue, ferociously, that it\u2019s all a Democratic witch-hunt, abetted by \u201cfake news\u201d media.\n\nTrump can do more damage than Nixon. His impeachment is imperative | Robert Reich Read more\n\nIf impeachment ends with Trump\u2019s acquittal \u2013 and given the Republicans\u2019 Senate majority and historical precedent, that\u2019s probable \u2013 his \u201cvictory\u201d, and the Democrats\u2019 ostensible defeat, will be used as a powerful launch-pad for a second Trump term, regardless of whether his main challenger is Biden, Elizabeth Warren or somebody else.\n\nIf on the other hand, it does not go Trump\u2019s way, all bets are off. Serious people, including some Republicans, worry that Trump is the \u201cdoomsday president\u201d, determined, if he goes down, to take everyone and everything down with him. If such a point is reached, it is frighteningly unclear whether a goaded, maddened Trump could be trusted to act sensibly and sanely on issues such as Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe dire example of King George III, another American sovereign who lost his reason and his crown, comes to mind.
