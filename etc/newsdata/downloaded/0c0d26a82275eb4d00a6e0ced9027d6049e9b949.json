Hoping everyone who was involved with the accident are not hurt.\n\nVisitor Aaron Murray posted: \"While being stuck for 2.5 hours has been rough, the occasional LOUD messages from the Skyliner is enough to put you slightly on edge. I understand protocol, but the repeated messages are similar to Chinese water torture techniques at this point.\"\n\nGuests have been instructed to use the emergency kits that are located under the benches inside the gondolas.\n\nMirror Online have contacted Disney for comment.", "description": "The ride, in Orlando, Florida, only opened for business six days ago but guests have been posting images of it being evacuated", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20485727.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EGKGKCMWoAEbey1jpeg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
