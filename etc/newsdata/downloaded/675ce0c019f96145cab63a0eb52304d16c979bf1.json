That\u00b4s the real collusion.\u00a8\n\nOn Saturday, Louisiana voters participate in a so-called \u00a8jungle primary\u201d in which incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards seeks a second term against two chief Republican challengers, Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone and U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham.\n\nIf none of the candidates wins 50 percent plus 1 of the vote Saturday, the top two vote getters will face each other in a November runoff.\n\nThe Republican challengers joined Mr. Trump on stage briefly at the end of his stump speech.\n\n\u00a8Tomorrow I need to you to send the radical Democratic establishment a message and send a great Republican to the governor\u00b4s mansion,\u00a8 Mr. Trump said.\n\nFor much of the campaign, Mr. Edwards had refrained from criticism of Mr. Trump, although his tone has changed as the president has thrown his support more and more explicitly behind the governor\u00b4s Republican opponents, Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone and Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham.\n\n\u00a8Behind your back he doesn\u00b4t like you,\u00a8 Mr. Trump said he is regularly informed of Mr. Edwards, who he noted, \u00a8was a super delegate for Crooked Hillary,\u00a8 in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn non-farm jobs Louisiana has actually seen a slight decline recently despite overall strong economic performances in the U.S., a rare poor showing that Mr. Trump said is attributable in part to Mr. Edwards\u00b4 close relationship with trial lawyers who are targeting the oil and gas industry for its alleged part in destroying the Louisiana coast.\n\n\u00a8Killing your jobs and attacking your industry,\u00a8 he described Mr. Edwards\u00b4 economic plans. \u00a8Ralph Abraham and Eddie are pro- your economy.\u00a8\n\nMr. Trump flew to Louisiana with a Little League all-star team from outside New Orleans that won the Little League World Series last summer, and his visit to Lake Charles was not marred by any of the violent displays that accompanied his Minnesota rally on Thursday night.\n\n\u00a8You won\u00b4t believe it but I\u00b4m going to this incredible place, Louisiana, tonight,\u00a8 Mr. Trump joked as he introduced the Little League players and described the Air Force One invitation he extended to them in the White House on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe president referred repeatedly to his August phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, which Democrats have characterized as an improper attempt to compel a foreign entity to investigate his political opponent, and compared it to the actions of former vice president Joe Biden\u00b4s son, Hunter.\n\nHunter Biden, despite no experience in the field, landed lucrative business deals with Ukrainian and Chinese interests after his father visited those countries, facts Mr. Trump argued are far more damning than the transcript he has released of his conversation with the Ukrainian president, Volodymer Zelentsky.\n\n\u00a8This rage-filled Democratic Party has gone completely insane,\u00a8 Mr. Trump said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
