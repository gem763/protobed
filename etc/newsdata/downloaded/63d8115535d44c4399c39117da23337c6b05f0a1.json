We\u2019re not saying seven-year-olds have to choose their careers now \u2013 but we must fight to keep their horizons open.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to waste talent from children as young as seven ruling out options if they are convinced their choices are limited by their gender, ethnicity or class.\n\nA charity aims to build up a national network of 100,000 volunteers to give school children an insight into the world of work (Dave Thompson/PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of social justice and common sense to tackle ingrained assumptions as early as possible or they will be very tough to unpick later on.\n\n\u201cWe need major employers, including government itself, to open up their workforces to primary schools.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford the mismatch between career aspirations and the reality of the job market so we need to be bolder in getting inspiring professionals into classrooms as early as possible.\u201d\n\nThe I Am #InspiringTheFuture campaign is calling on business to support the effort, which aims to give millions of children the chance to meet people from different industries and professions.\n\nThe charity said the long-term goal is to create 10 million face-to-face meetings between pupils and volunteers.\n\nMr Schleicher said: \u201cWe all had light bulb moments at school when we\u2019ve met someone who inspires us to think big about our potential, our future and our goals.\n\n\u201cWe believe every single young person has an equal right to that same light bulb moment \u2013 wherever they live, whatever their parents do, and whatever school they go to.\u201d\n\nThe campaign will help to \u201ctackle the imbalance in accessing role models\u201d, he argued.\n\n\u201cThere is no silver bullet in boosting social mobility \u2013 but understanding the world beyond the classroom and home must be universal. It can\u2019t be rationed to certain young people and not others.\u201d\n\nMr Schleicher is leading the OECD\u2019s major Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) study, which evaluates education systems around the world by testing 15-year-olds from around the world every three years in reading, maths and science.\n\nHe was once described by former education secretary Michael Gove as \u201cthe most important man in education\u201d.\n\nAn updated report published by the OECD and Education Employers says research shows children\u2019s socio-economic background and their gender have an effect on their career aspirations.\n\n\u201cGender stereotyping is particularly evident when it comes to science careers,\u201d it says.\n\n\u201cThough both girls and boys may expect to work in a science-related career, they tend to see themselves in very different fields.\u201d\n\nIt adds that the PISA study has found that while most 15-year-olds have an idea about the type of work they want to do, one in three students cites one of only 10 occupations.\n\nEducation & Employers connects teachers to volunteers who can be invited into schools to share their career stories.\n\nThe network currently has 55,000 volunteers, ranging from apprentices to chief executives and is linked up with 80% of secondary schools and 20% of primaries in England.\n\nChief executive Nick Chambers said: \u201cToo often young people\u2019s ambitions are narrowed by an innate sense of what people from their background should aspire to \u2013 and what\u2019s out of reach.\n\n\u201cInspiring the Future can\u2019t end ingrained social, race or gender barriers but we can give schools the tools to start dismantling them. We must go the extra mile in helping teachers and parents show young people what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nThe campaign is particularly targeting primary schools, working with primary futures initiative, which helps teachers to provide careers education.\n\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers \u2013 one of the groups running primary futures \u2013 said: \u201cThe importance of exposure to the world of work at primary age cannot be overstated. The earlier children\u2019s aspirations are raised and broadened, the better.\u201d", "description": "Education & Employers aims to build up a UK national network of 100,000 volunteers to give children an insight into the world of work.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715244-1571094321-482_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
