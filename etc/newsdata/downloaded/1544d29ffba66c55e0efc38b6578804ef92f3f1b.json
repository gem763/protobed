However, after Monday's match, it tried to play down the incidents.\n\n\"It's quite disappointing to focus on racism,\" BFU Vice President Yordan Lechkov said. \"It's not serious to concentrate on that if there's a qualifier like this and we're playing against a team like England.\"\n\n'Strongest possible action'\n\nUEFA had ordered the BFU to partially close the Vasil Levski national stadium for England's visit after supporters were found guilty of racist behaviour in matches earlier this year.\n\nRacist chanting was heard from the stands and reported by England players to manager Gareth Southgate, with the referee informed and a public announcement made on two occasions.\n\nMost of Bulgaria's players and their coach said after the match they had not heard any abuse of the visiting team.\n\nCoach Krasimir Balakov said there had not been such racial incidents before and blamed England fans for being disrespectful to Bulgarian supporters.\n\n\"During the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable,\" he said.\n\nThe BFU and a number of Bulgarian clubs have been fined for racist abuse several times over the past few years.\n\nTroy Townsend, of football equality campaign group Kick It Out, urged UEFA to ban Bulgaria.\n\n\"(UEFA) have to take the strongest possible action and that for me, is to kick Bulgaria out of the European qualifiers. It's the only way people will take note of what they are doing to our black players.\"", "description": "Growing anger at country's football union after racist chanting by Bulgarian fans towards black England players.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/cb139bdf15234eaab5b9e2d493f52982_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
