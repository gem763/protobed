They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for ... almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN,\" the president added.\n\nTrump on the defensive: Later, as criticism began to pile up, Trump threatened to \"obliterate\" Ankara's economy if Turkey acts in a way he deems is \"off limits.\"\n\nAs the day wore on, Trump said that while he has \"great respect\" for the prominent Republicans who are urging him to reconsider his strategy, \"it's time to come back home.\"\n\nAsked if he consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the decision, Trump claimed that he had.\n\n\"I consulted with everybody,\" he said. \"I always consult with everybody.\"\n\nBut as Trump spoke, a senior administration official told reporters in a phone briefing that the shift in strategy did not constitute a withdrawal, and that the impacted troops would merely be relocated to other bases in the region.\n\nThe opposition: Republican lawmakers panned Trump's decision Monday and called on him to reverse course.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham vows to publicly question whistleblowers if Trump is impeached Key Republicans split with Trump on Biden investigation push GOP searches for impeachment boogeyman MORE (R-S.C.) blasted the administration during an appearance on Fox News's \"Fox & Friends,\" and in a tweet thread, calling it a \"disaster in the making\" and \"shortsighted.\"\n\nGraham and Sen.

The U.S. Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\n\"In conversations between the department and the Turkish military we have consistently stressed that coordination and cooperation were the best path toward security in the area,\" Hoffman added.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperPentagon distances itself from Ukraine controversy North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Trump defense head says US has stepped up attacks on Taliban since talks broke down MORE and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley also \"reiterated to their respective Turkish counterparts that unilateral action creates risks for Turkey,\" according to the statement.\n\nPentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Carla Gleason later said Turkey has been removed from the Air Tasking Order, which is what the U.S. military uses to organize and instruct air forces. As part of that, the United States is no longer sharing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of the region with Turkey, she said.\n\nPENTAGON SUBPOENAED IN IMPEACHMENT PROBE: House Democrats on Monday subpoenaed the heads of the Defense Department and Office of Management and Budget for documents related to the Trump administration's decision to withhold financial aid to Ukraine while the president pushed the allied nation for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment Why Elizabeth Warren will fail to shine in her moment on the trail MORE and his son, Hunter.\n\nIn letters to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) acting director Russell Vought, the three committee chairmen leading the House's impeachment inquiry asked for the documents to be provided by Oct. 15.\n\n\"The enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House's decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSE Cupp: How much longer will allies excuse Trump's behavior? Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy Attorney says he's representing second Trump whistleblower from intel community MORE (D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelHouse chairman: Pompeo not complying with impeachment inquiry Sunday shows preview: Republicans on defense as new reports emerge on impeachment Intel Dem: No reason for White House to defy subpoena unless Trump is 'guilty' MORE (D-N.Y.) and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsIntel Dem: No reason for White House to defy subpoena unless Trump is 'guilty' Trump rails against whistleblower, impeachment inquiry Overnight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign MORE (D-Md.) wrote.\n\nWhat Democrats want: The committee chairmen are demanding that Esper hand over documents related to Trump's phone calls with the Ukrainian president and efforts by any current or former Trump administration officials to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThey are also seeking documents from both Esper and Vought on the delay of foreign assistance to Ukraine, including communications with people in the White House and other agencies, as well as the decision in September announcing that the aid would go forward. In addition, the committee chairmen are asking for documents related to communications with Congress about the status of the foreign aid, such as briefings and written notifications.\n\nPentagon would rather stay out of it: Over the weekend, The Hill's Ellen Mitchell took a look at how the Pentagon has been trying to distance itself from the impeachment drama.\n\nDepartment officials last week downplayed the administration's holdup of military aid to Ukraine and preemptively ordering employees to turn over for preservation any documents and communications having to do with it.\n\nQuestions remain about whether the Pentagon was involved in or even aware of the decision to withhold the money. Officials have declined to answer questions, citing the confidentiality of conversations between the department and the White House. Pentagon officials also have insisted there is a \"solid working relationship\" between the two.\n\n\"It looks bad in one sense to be out of the loop,\" said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"It looks good in another sense because then they aren't implicated themselves in any chicanery,\" he added.\n\nNORTH KOREA TALKS FALTER AS SOON AS THEY START: What started out as a hopeful weekend for North Korea nuclear talks to revive quickly flamed out as Pyongyang said they ended talks because the United States brought no new ideas to the table.\n\n\"The negotiations have not fulfilled our expectation and finally broke off,\" North Korean negotiator Kim Myong Gil told reporters Saturday in Sweden.\n\n\"The U.S. raised expectations by offering suggestions like a flexible approach, new method and creative solutions, but they have disappointed us greatly and dampened our enthusiasm for negotiation by bringing nothing to the negotiation table,\" he said.\n\nA day later, North Korea said it has no intention to hold such \"sickening\" talks again.\n\n\"We have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as what happened this time before the U.S. takes a substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward the DPRK, a policy that threatens the security of the country and hampers the rights to existence and development of its people,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency.\n\nUS tells different story: In a statement Saturday afternoon, the State Department said Kim's comments \"do not reflect the content or the spirit of today's 8 1/2 hour discussion,\" and added that the U.S. had accepted an invitation from Swedish officials to return in two weeks for more negotiations.\n\nIt was unclear whether North Korean officials have formally declined the invitation.\n\n\"At the conclusion of our discussions, the United States proposed to accept the invitation of our Swedish hosts to return to Stockholm to meet again in two weeks time, in order to continue discussions on all of the topics. The United States delegation has accepted this invitation,\" the State Department said.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies will host \"An Ocean of Change: How Climate Change is Upending our View of Maritime Sustainability, Sovereignty, and Security,\" with a keynote from former chief of naval operations Adm.
