REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis\n\nLast month, Saudi Arabia replaced Iraq as top oil supplier to India after a gap of about 13 months, the data showed.\n\nSeptember oil imports, which dropped below 4 million bpd for the first time since June 2016, were about 18.7% lower than in August and down 8.4% from a year ago, the data showed.\n\nThe fall in oil imports limited India\u2019s fiscal deficit for September, but it also potentially points to a general economic and industrial slowdown.\n\n\u201cLower imports were largely due to refinery turnarounds as refiners have to supply Euro VI fuels in the country from an April 1 deadline. Heavy rains and slower industrial and construction work drain down the demand for refined fuels,\u201d said Ehsan Ul Haq, an analyst with Refinitiv.\n\nFor a table on shutdowns at Asian refineries see:\n\nFalling industrial demand dragged India\u2019s fuel demand to its lowest in more than two years in September.\n\n\u201cDue to weakening fuel demand there was an inventory build up of refined products so we had to cut crude processing and restrict imports,\u201d said an official at one of the refiners.\n\nIndian refiners\u2019 crude processing declined about 7% in September from a year ago, government data showed on Tuesday.\n\nSAUDI OUTSHINES IRAQ\n\nSaudi Arabia supplied about 830,500 bpd oil to India in September, compared with 821,000 bpd supplied by Iraq, the data obtained from sources showed. The sources declined to be identified.\n\nIndia restricted imports from Iraq in September as it had imported record volumes of Basra oil in August.\n\n\u201cBy reducing their official selling price (OSP) Saudi attracted more buyers compared to others, they continue to meet the demand even after outages due to attacks on its two fields,\u201d Haq said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has cut its September OSP for its Arab Light grade for Asia by $0.75/barrel compared to a $0.40/barrel reduction in Iraq\u2019s Basra Light.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates emerged as India\u2019s third biggest supplier in September after a gap of seven months, knocking Nigeria into fourth place, a position held by Venezuela in August. The UAE was fifth biggest oil supplier in August.\n\nVenezuela was in sixth place behind Angola as private refiner Nayara Energy did not ship oil from the Latin American country in September and instead discharged old cargoes, the data showed.\n\nLower imports by Nayara had also dented India\u2019s overall purchases in September, the data showed.\n\n\u201cAny sustained decline in India\u2019s oil imports and fuel demand might prompt global agencies to revise down their oil demand growth forecast,\u201d Haq said.\n\nOPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have trimmed their global oil demand growth forecast for 2019. The IEA expects 2019 global oil demand growth to be the weakest since 2016, following evidence of a slowdown in economies including Europe, India, Japan, Korea and the United States.\n\nThe IEA said India\u2019s oil consumption rose by 235,000 bpd on average during 2014-18, nearly a fifth of the global total. The growth could moderate to 170,000 bpd in 2019, the slowest since 2014, due to an economic slowdown, the IEA said.\n\nAsia\u2019s third-largest economy expanded by just 5% in the June quarter, its slowest pace since 2013. The country\u2019s central bank has also cut its growth forecast for 2019-20 to 6.1% from prior projection of 6.9%.", "description": "India's oil imports fell to their lowest in more than three years in September to 3.82 million barrels per day (bpd), data obtained from industry and shipping sources showed, as some refiners cut purchases due to shutdowns for maintenance and fuel upgrades.", "authors": ["Nidhi Verma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443732719&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L12K", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
