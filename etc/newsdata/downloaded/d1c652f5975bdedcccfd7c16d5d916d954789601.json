Our position is consistent and clear.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House last week, President Trump floated the idea that China and Ukraine should probe the Biden family.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as Ukraine,\u201d the president said ahead of a visit to Florida to deliver remarks on Medicare.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company secured a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013.\n\nAsked if Ukraine should follow suit with its own inquiry into the Bidens, President Trump replied: \u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation,\u201d before adding: \u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked; that was a crooked deal, 100 percent.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this year:\n\nBiden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden [$83,000] as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.)\n\nWhile Democrats and establishment media figures were enraged by President Trump\u2019s suggestion for China and Ukraine to probe the Biden, leading Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, voiced support for the move.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, the American people elected President Trump and I for many reasons: get the economy moving again, to rebuild our military, but they also elected us to drain the swamp,\u201d Pence told the Arizona Republic.\u201cI think the American people have a right to know if someone who held the second-highest office in the land was involved in corrupt activities, either in China or in Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "China said it will not investigate accusations of corruption against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, after President Trump suggestion.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178639463-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
