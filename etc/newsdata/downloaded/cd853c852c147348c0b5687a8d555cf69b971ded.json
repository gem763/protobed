Other charges include sedition and the misuse of public funds.\n\nThe unilateral independence referendum, held in defiance of the Spanish constitution on 1 October 2017, provoked Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis since its return to democracy following the end of the Franco dictatorship.\n\nLess than a month after the referendum, which was met with a heavy-handed police response, the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence.\n\nThe Spanish government reacted to the declaration by using the constitution to assume direct control of the region and sack the pro-independence regional president, Carles Puigdemont, and his administration.\n\nThe trial, held at the supreme court in Madrid, lasted four months and heard from more than 400 witnesses, including Spain\u2019s prime minister at the time, Mariano Rajoy.\n\nThe proceedings also examined the events of 20 September 2017, when police raided Catalan regional government offices and arrested 14 senior officials in an attempt to head off the vote.\n\nThe raids brought thousands of Catalans out to protest. Guardia Civil officers found themselves trapped inside the buildings they were searching and three of their vehicles were vandalised.\n\nThe state prosecutor, Javier Zaragoza, argued such behaviour constituted \u201cphysical, compulsive and intimidatory violence\u201d, adding: \u201cThe violent nature of an uprising does not mean there has to be either serious or armed violence.\u201d\n\nZaragoza told the court that the push for secession had been a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d designed to \u201coverturn, suspend the constitution completely or partially, and declare the independence of one part of the national territory\u201d.\n\nHowever, defence lawyers rejected such arguments, arguing that while there may have been \u201cdisobedience\u201d, there had been no rebellion.\n\nThe supreme court has refused to comment on reports that the trial judges have to decided to acquit the defendants of the most serious charge of rebellion, which involves \u201crevolting violently and publicly\u201d.\n\nUnder the Spanish penal code, the lesser offence of sedition is defined as \u201crising up publicly and tumultuously to prevent, through force or beyond legal means, the application of the law\u201d. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years.\n\nPuigdemont is not among those on trial. He fled into self-imposed exile in Belgium to avoid arrest.", "description": "Oriol Junqueras, Carme Forcadell, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S\u00e0nchez among nine defendants facing 25-year term", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aae67c74b9d9cf0953934e6e9d7dfcd35aa616b1/0_9_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b14b23a5476db79f52dd30cfc5162cc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
