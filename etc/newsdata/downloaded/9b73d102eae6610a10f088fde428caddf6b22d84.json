Dr. Lee identified it as a lipoma, a slow-growing, non-cancerous growth\n\nAt the start of the clip, Dr. Lee explains that a lipoma is a slow-growing, non-cancerous growth that is usually removed in a 'simple' in-office procedure under local anesthesia.\n\nHowever, the graphic clip isn't for the faint of heart.\n\nIn the video, Dr. Lee uses a scalpel to slice into the lipoma that is hidden underneath his hair before digging into it with a pair of scissors.\n\nThe man has had the fatty bulge for so long that he admits it's been nicknamed 'Lumpy.'\n\nOuch!

Dr. Lee calmly asks as she pokes around his head, which is bleeding profusely. Understandably, he can't even muster a reply.\n\nFamous: Dr. Lee has more than 5.7 million YouTube subscribers thanks to her graphic 'popping' videos\n\nAs the doctor removes the lipoma bit by bit, the man can't help but ask: 'My brains aren't going to come out, right?'\n\nDr. Lee manages to remove the entire thing, and she jokingly asks if he wants to add a lucky coin or a baseball card to his scalp before she stitches it closed again.\n\n'Or a love note? Like a time capsule,' she says with a laugh.\n\nAfter the procedure, the man notes that his head is 'so flat,' but he is stunned when he sees pieces of his lipoma sitting out on a tray.\n\n'Ugh! That was in my head?' he asks.\n\nWhile they were able to laugh and joke about the procedure, viewers weren't feeling quite as calm about the gory scene they witnessed.\n\nGood question: 'My brains aren't going to come out, right?' the man asks during the procedure\n\nSuccess: Dr. Lee manages to remove the entire thing, and she jokingly asks if he wants to add a lucky coin or a baseball card to his scalp before she stitches it closed again\n\n'Whenever there is \"oozing,\" I have to avert my eyes,' one person commented, adding: 'I can do all the gross stuff, but not lots of blood!'\n\n'Thank goodness for the skull! Looks like you were pulling his brains out!! Lol,' another added.\n\nAnd one joker chimed in: 'So THAT'S what it means when someone picks your brains...'\n\nHowever, there were some who were able to see past the blood and pus and focus instead on the man's handsome looks.\n\nMystery man: Viewers got a glimpse of the man's green eyes towards the end of the clip\n\nWow: The patient is stunned by the lipoma that is sitting on a tray after the procedure\n\nMixed reviews: Some viewers thought it looked like Dr. Lee was pulling his brains out of his head, while others were charmed by the man's 'sexy smile' and 'gorgeous voice'\n\nAlthough the top half of his face was completely covered for most of the procedure, his bottom profile was enough to get some tongues wagging.\n\n'Not gonna lie, the guy had a cute smile,' one person commented, while another agreed: 'He has a real sexy smile and voice.'\n\n'You can tell this guy's hot because of his lips, smile, and voice,' someone else gushed.\n\nOne outlet reported that the good looking guy in the clip was Bachelorette star Peter Weber, but Dr. Lee confirmed to DailyMail.com that it was not.\n\n\n\n", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Dr. Pimple Popper aka Dr. Sandra Lee can be seen removing a large lipoma from an unidentified\u00a0patent's\u00a0head in her latest YouTube video.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611782-0-image-a-50_1570836747932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
