REUTERS/Phil Noble/Illustration\n\nFor the first 24 hours after the court ruled Johnson had acted unlawfully in proroguing parliament, sterling rallied. But a vitriolic parliamentary session on Wednesday made clear that the political deadlock over Brexit is far from broken, heralding a difficult few months for the pound and other British assets.\n\nFor some money managers, such as Kaspar Hense, a portfolio manager at Bluebay Asset Management, the court verdict is nevertheless a reason to stick with a bullish pound conviction. He ditched his long-held bearish stance on the British currency at the end of August.\n\nHense, whose team manages $60 billion (\u00a349 billion), says markets are overpricing the risk of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without an exit deal to minimise economic disruption.\n\n\u201cWe think the probability of no-deal has fallen even further,\u201d Hense said, predicting the pound would strengthen to 85 pence against the euro before there is a general election. It was trading at 88.8 pence on Friday.\n\nBetting markets support Hense\u2019s view and increasingly doubt Brexit will happen at all next month. Odds on Johnson managing to strike a deal with Brussels are now at 5/1 compared with 7/2 last week, according to Betfair Exchange.\n\nAnd odds on Johnson leaving Downing Street in 2019 have narrowed to 2/1 from 11/4 last week. Currency traders might see that as positive given his willingness to embrace an abrupt exit if a deal cannot be secured.\n\nOn the other hand, action in the pound, buffeted for three years by Brexit news, implies that even if a no-deal scenario is averted, the path towards that outcome will be rocky.\n\nHaving risen more than 5% from a three-year low of below $1.20 on Sept. 3 to $1.2582 last week, and popping up half a cent on the Supreme Court ruling, the pound slipped back towards $1.23 on Thursday.\n\nThe ruling increased confidence in UK assets, \u201cbut the prospect of a general election and potential Corbyn government would unsettle things anew\u201d said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party has promised nationalisation, higher taxation and tighter regulation.\n\nThe main risk seen by markets is that Johnson circumvents parliament\u2019s wishes and manages to take the UK out of the EU by Oct. 31 without a deal.\n\nSecond is a general election by year-end. Opinion polls put Johnson\u2019 Conservatives in the lead, with all that means for a Brexit crash, but markets are also wary of a Labour victory.\n\nNo overall majority would leave parliament stuck where it is now on Brexit \u2014 split down the middle.\n\nThe possibility of a Brexit extension to Jan. 31 is hardly a balm for long-term investors either.\n\n\u201cTo believe a no-deal Brexit will be successfully avoided, the anti-Brexit parties have to win the general election when it happens and there is simply no way of knowing that,\u201d said Kamal Sharma, head of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nSharma is avoiding directional bets on the pound and instead recommends buying implied volatility options for sterling \u2014 a gauge of expected price swings in an asset.\n\nInvestors tend to buy these options as protection against volatility around key dates and their high price \u2014 implied volatility gauges for the pound are currently double those on the yen and euro \u2014 essentially reflects purchasers\u2019 unease.\n\nThree-month options encompassing the Oct. 31 Brexit date and possibly a late October or early November election are meanwhile trading much higher than any other maturity along the one-month to one-year curve.\n\nTwo-month implied volatility has also risen, given its expiry date could also capture an election.\n\nOne-month expiry options, encompassing the Oct. 19 deadline set by parliament for Johnson to seek a Brexit extension, have receded slightly since the ruling but remain elevated.\n\nSix-month implied vol \u2014 capturing the next potential Brexit date of Jan. 31 if an extension is agreed \u2014 remains subdued but could be the next contract to watch.\n\nAdam Cole, chief strategist at RBC Capital Markets says that while his proprietary gauge shows the likelihood of an Oct. 31 no-deal Brexit has ebbed, it could rise again.\n\n\u201cA delay now looks inevitable ... there is no (option) price for 2020 yet, but markets are no doubt rolling some risk into 2020,\u201d he added.\n\nRISK\n\nBearish pound positions in futures markets have neared historical extremes in the last week, with hedge funds raising their net positions against the pound to $6.7 billion, just off 2-1/2 year peaks of $7.8 billion touched in early September.\n\nAnother barometer of appetite for the currency is risk reversals \u2014 contracts using calls or puts to hedge a position, essentially options that confer the right to buy or sell at a pre-set price.\n\nThree-month risk reversals show a significant negative view on the pound \u2014 meaning the premium for puts is far greater around the election timeframe\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThere is a bright spot \u2014 pound weakness has encouraged overseas buyers to snap up British assets, from pubs to theme parks in a flurry of dealmaking that brings investment into a country dogged by persistent current account deficits.\n\n\u201cYou have started to get UK assets picked off \u2014 Greene King, Cobham \u2014 and that seems to be getting some traction,\u201d said McPherson, though he added that portfolio managers were still wary.\n\n\u201cA bit of that is Brexit,\u201d he said.", "description": "Fading hopes that Tuesday's UK Supreme Court verdict quashing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament marked a big step back from a no-deal Brexit have seen the pound's gains dissolve as investors prepare for yet more uncertainty.", "authors": ["Saikat Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434454072&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0FS", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
