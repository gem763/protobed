He speaks four or five languages and that is the best way to understand how open-minded he is and one of his best friends is Mendy. He\u2019s like a brother for him.\n\n\u201cThe image is not about the colour of the skin. He took a picture of Benjamin when he was young and he related it to this cartoon, which was quite similar for the image.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think what happened about that. If they want to do that and ask for Bernardo, I think he will be open to talk. But first you have to know exactly which person you are talking about.\n\n\u201cThere are many situations with people, with white people and you look at a cartoon and the face is quite similar as your face and you put it in there, it is quite similar.\n\n\u201cI think the response from Mendy was clear after that. They are joking all the time. Maybe what I say as advice is to hide social media\u2026 if something happened it would be a mistake.\n\n\u201cBernardo is an exceptional person. A guy who can speak five languages, it\u2019s because he\u2019s open-minded \u2013 nothing about the colour of the skin, nationalities or whatever.\u201d", "description": "Pep Guardiola has defended Bernardo Silva against allegations of racism after the Football Association asked for Manchester City\u2018s observations on one of the player\u2019s deleted tweets.
