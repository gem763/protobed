Do I want to die?\n\n\"Not necessarily, but I don\u2019t wanna spend the rest of my life the way I am right now.\u201d\n\nHe's due to be executed on November 13.\n\nCharles Rhines - Donut shop murder\n\nIn 1992 Rhines was caught robbing a donut shop in Rapid City, South Dakota by an employee.\n\nDonnivan Schaeffer, 22, was stabbed in the abdomen and back.\n\nThen, as Schaeffer pleaded for his life, Rhines thrust the blade into the base of his skull the court heard.\n\nAfter 27 years on death row, the killer is set to be executed on November 3.\n\nJusten Hall - Electrical cord killer\n\nHall was sent to death row in 2005, three years after strangling a woman with an electrical cord.\n\nHis attorneys raised concerns about DNA testing on the cord used to kill Melissa Billhartz and suggested his confession was coerced.\n\nBut in 2016, Hall asked to waive his appeals in a letter to the court.\n\n\u201cThese walls 24/7 have broken me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is taking every last ounce of will to even make it from day to day.\u201d\n\nHe's due to be executed on November 6.\n\nRodney Reed - Rape and murder\n\nRodney Reed was charged with the murder of 20-year-old Stacey Stites in 1996.\n\nHe was convicted of strangling her during an aggravated sexual assault in Bastrop, Texas.\n\nBut the victim's family have since made big efforts to save him - as they claim she was actually strangled to death by a her police officer ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"We have to stand up and say, look, there are too many questions to execute a man without them all being answered,\" the family said in a previous statement.\n\nOriginally due to be executed in 2015, he's due to be put to death in Texas on November 20.", "description": "Cop killer Patrick Murphy, Rodney Reed, Charles Rhines and Justen Hall are all due to be put to death in the US in November", "authors": ["Sam Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16476707.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BSP_SML_300317676JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
