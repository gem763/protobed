How long will it last this time?\n\nPiper Jaffray\u2019s Alexander Potter agreed, and said it\u2019s becoming hard to see Tesla\u2019s rivals catching up with it in the next three-year time period.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that investors underestimate Tesla\u2019s ability to consolidate the automotive market, and we reiterate our Overweight rating,\u201d Potter wrote in a note to clients. The analyst is keeping his price target unchanged at $372.\n\nBut there were skeptics too, including RBC analyst Joseph Spak, who said the stock reaction \u2014 it was last up about 18% \u2014 was overdone and valuation still seems stretched.\n\nSee: 7 affordable luxury SUVs from nonluxury brands\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to have more confidence in the improvement but details are limited,\u201d Spak wrote in a note. \u201cThe bulk seems to be driven by material and general costs reduction.\u201d\n\nTesla said it earned $143 million in the third quarter, or 80 cents a share, compared with $311 million, or $1.82 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, Tesla earned $342 million, or $1.91 a share, compared with adjusted earnings of $3.02 a year ago.\n\nAlso: Ford stock slips on fourth-quarter headwinds\n\nRevenue fell to $6.30 billion from $6.82 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an adjusted loss of 46 cents a share on sales of $6.43 billion for the quarter.\n\nIn a call with Wall Street analysts following results, Tesla executives reiterated that both the \u201cgigafactory\u201d in China and the Model Y, Tesla\u2019s next vehicle, are ahead of schedule; reaffirmed the goal to remain in the black; and said they believe the Model Y, which will be more profitable, won\u2019t cannibalize Model 3 sales. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an adjusted loss of 46 cents a share on sales of $6.43 billion for the quarter.\n\nFor more, read: Tesla stock rallies 20% after surprise quarterly profit\n\n\u201cCost control can help a quarter, but we struggle to understand how spending doesn\u2019t have to go up to support Tesla\u2019s growth ambitions,\u201d said Spak. He noted that capex continues to come in lower and absolute sales, general and administration costs are still near 2017 levels, when deliveries were at about 23% of third-quarter 2019 levels.\n\n\u201cTesla already hinted that margins could start to take a step back in 4Q19 as China factory comes online. This could accelerate in 1H20 as China continues to ramp, and recall on the 2Q19 call, Elon indicated demand to start 2020 could be \u201ctough\u201d,\u201d Spak wrote. \u201cWe believe Tesla has been deferring Shanghai capex payments into 2020, so cash flow could get hit further. Net, profits/cash flow could be tougher over next 3 quarters.\u201d\n\nNeedham analyst Rajvindra Gill also asked if the profit was sustainable, noting that Tesla said it has now reached a point of being self funding with \u201cpossible temporary exceptions,\u201d like product launches and ramps.\n\n\u201cWe believe the latter is a key caveat as Tesla focuses on ramping Gigafactory Shanghai or Model Y,\u201d Gill wrote in a note. The analyst is sticking with an underperform rating on the stock.\n\nJPMorgan analysts Ryan Brinkman and Rajat Gupta raised their price target to $220 from $200 on the numbers, but reiterated their underweight rating. The analysts said they are unsure that the quarter is really the breakout touted by the bulls.\n\nSee: The CEO of this robo-taxi company believes it has the inside track on rivals\n\n\u201cOur conversations with investors suggest they are more focused on gross margin than operating expense (and hence more likely to reward gross margin-driven beats than operating expense-driven beats),\u201d they wrote in a note. \u201cThis is because of the belief that the current period trend in gross margin is more indicative of the likely future trend than in the case of operating expense.\u201d\n\nBut gross margin is dependent on variable product costs and gross margin-driven beats suggest Tesla is making progress on that front, one about which there has been a great deal of debate, they wrote. And while gross margin beat, \u201cwe are not certain about the quality of this beat.\u201d\n\nThe analysts said if given the opportunity on the earnings call, they would have asked questions about non-recurring items, which they said may or may not be material.\n\nTesla shares have fallen 23% in 2019, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.00% has gained 20% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.25% has gained 15%.\n\nSee: Why your best stock bets for the next 10 years are Disney and Target, says this CEO", "description": "Tesla Inc. shares continued their late-session rally in premarket trade Thursday, as analysts weighing in on its third-quarter surprise profit waxed lyrical...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT910_elon_p_ZG_20191024090536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
