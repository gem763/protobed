But former members of the agency tell the BBC what may have gone wrong.\n\nChandrayaan-2 (Moon vehicle 2) entered the Moon's orbit on 20 August and was due to land on the lunar surface a little after midnight India local time (1800 GMT) on 7 September - a month after it first shot into space.\n\nBut contact was lost moments before the lander (named Vikram, after Isro founder Vikram Sarabhai) was expected to touch down at the lunar south pole.\n\nThe orbiter has since spotted the lander on the surface of the Moon but scientists have not yet been able to establish contact with it.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The even was watched by millions across India\n\nThe lander's final heart-stopping descent was being monitored on screens, which displayed its velocity profile. The readings reflected the movement of the lander as it headed towards the surface of the Moon.\n\nThe screens carrying the readings appeared on television and various social media accounts as the landing was broadcast live on TV.\n\nWhen the countdown began, the lander was moving at a velocity of 1,640 metres per second. Scientists say it appeared to be moving as planned during the first two phases of deceleration, known as the rough braking and fine braking operations. It was during the final stage, known as the \"hovering\" stage, that the problem occurred.\n\nThe problem could well have been with the lander's central engine, according to Prof Roddam Narasimha, a former member of Isro, adding that his theory was based on the readings on the screen.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Modi consoles scientists after India moon-lander loses contact\n\n\"One plausible explanation was that the lander started falling more rapidly,\" he told BBC Hindis's Imran Qureshi. \"It's supposed to come down at a velocity of two metres per second when it hits the Moon's surface. But the gravity on the moon would have made it fall somewhat more rapidly.''\n\nHe believes this could be because the central engine was not \"producing the thrust that is required and, therefore, the deceleration was no longer what it was supposed to be\".\n\nAnd this, in turn, may have led to eventually losing communication with the lander itself.\n\nThe head of India's first Moon mission, Mylswamy Annadurai, also said the anomaly in the velocity profile was an indication that something had malfunctioned in the lander as it hurtled towards the Moon.\n\n\"Most likely the orientation [of the lander] could have been disrupted. Once we look at the data we will be able to say for sure what happened, but it is likely that either a sensor or a thruster could have malfunctioned,\" he told BBC Tamil.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Prime Minister Narendra Modi also watched the event live\n\nDr Rajeswari Rajagopalan, the head of the Nuclear and Space Policy Initiative of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), also said an engine malfunction was the likeliest reason.\n\n\"In the absence of data parameters, it is difficult to come to a conclusion but the [readings on the screen did show that something was wrong. The other possibility is that when you do a landing at a higher speed, you cause a lot of dust to rise that also shakes up the spacecraft because of the gravitational pull. But it's more likely the malfunctioning of one of the engines,\" she told BBC Hindi.\n\nChandrayaan-2 was the most complex mission ever attempted by Isro.\n\nThe lander carried within its belly a 27kg Moon rover (called Pragyan - wisdom in Sanskrit) with instruments to analyse the lunar soil.\n\nThe rover had the capacity to travel 500m from the lander in its 14-day life span, and would have sent data and images back to Earth for analysis.\n\nThe mission would have focused on the lunar surface, searching for water and minerals and measuring moonquakes, among other things.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Is India a space superpower?\n\nRead more about India's space ambitions", "description": "The BBC asks former members of India's space agency what went wrong with its most complex mission.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14A42/production/_108664548_gettyimages-1166462158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
