He\u2019s a straight-forward, plain-speaking individual who occasionally blows off steam by tending net, the highest-pressure position in hockey. As he says, \u201cthe puck stops with me,\u201d both on the ice and in the boardroom. When he\u2019s not in those places, you might find Saputo at a hockey player agency he founded called Quartexx Management, whose clients include 42 former first-round picks, or perhaps at the Amelia and Lino Saputo Jr. Foundation, created in 2011 and presided over by his wife, or perhaps he\u2019s checking out a luxury car to add to his collection, a passion he shares with his father. \u201cIt is a busy life, but you need to stay busy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou seem to find the time for the things that motivate you and keep you excited. My wife runs the foundation and that gets me excited as well. Giving money away actually gets me very excited. Mentoring the young kids in the agency gets me very excited and I get to do that with my wife as well. I guess I\u2019m a fortunate man, because I\u2019ve got great balance in my life.\u201d What follows is a condensed and edited interview with Saputo done on Sept. 10 just before he flew to Europe on yet another business trip.\n\nFPM: Congratulations on being named Canada\u2019s Outstanding CEO of the Year. We always ask this, but why do you think you have earned this award? Saputo: I\u2019m now 31 years into this business on a full-time basis and in this role since 2004, but I\u2019m not quite sure why they chose now to be the right time. I know our company has evolved a great deal over the course of the last 10-15 years, but I feel very fortunate that I started off with a foundation that was very, very solid, a culture that was very, very strong, and I just capitalized on what my father and my grandfather built, so perhaps this award should be going to my grandfather and my father and not to me. FPM: Funny you say that because in 2016, your family did get an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. I remember thinking at the time, how is a third-generation, family-run enterprise considered entrepreneurs? Saputo: Our industry itself is not static. The dairy industry in some cases has, in some jurisdictions, heavy regulation and others have low regulation. You need to navigate through the ups and downs of what\u2019s going on in our industry and we need to remain entrepreneurial. It\u2019s not going to be a carbon copy template that we need to be following. As things evolve, as things change, we need to adapt and that\u2019s really the true entrepreneurship of what we stand for. Consumer tastes change, market dynamics change, emerging markets change, even trade agreements change. If you want to remain relevant to your consumers, to your customers and also to your talent pool, you need to evolve with the times. The things that we focus on today might be a little bit different than what my father and my grandfather focused on, things like the social aspect, the environment, the community. All of those things are as important today as profitability and sustainability. FPM: You mentioned that the dairy industry isn\u2019t that static, but a lot of people have a static image of it. What\u2019s the dynamic that they don\u2019t understand? Saputo: If you look at the Canadian regulatory environment with the milk supply management system, perhaps it could be pretty static. There\u2019s a lot more stability here than we would find in other markets, but if you go outside of Canada, whether it would be the United States, Argentina, Australia and now the U.K., there\u2019s nothing static about the industry. Things evolve, even in terms of supply and demand, the amount of solids available for the market relative to the growth in the dairy industry needs to be properly managed and harnessed. When you think about open-market systems and then you think about the geopolitical issues that we need to contend with, whether it\u2019s the U.S. selling to China or not selling to China, selling to Mexico, not selling to Mexico, think about the embargoes in Russia \u2014 and Russia is a big platform for us \u2014 we need to navigate extremely well. It\u2019s a fine dance that you\u2019ve got to dance every day, because nothing remains the same day after day.\n\nThe Essential Lino Saputo Jr. Career Became CEO and president in March 2004, becoming vice-chairman in April 2011 and then chairman in August 2017. He started his career in 1988 as an administrative assistant at Saputo, becoming vice-president of operations in 1993 and then executive vice-president in 1998. He then joined Uniforet Inc., a family owned lumber company, in 2000 as an assistant to the president, before being named president and chief operating officer of Saputo\u2019s Dairy Products Division (USA) in July 2001 for a three-year stint, becoming president of the bakery division for a short period in early 2004.\n\n2019 fixed compensation $3.6 million Boards In addition to being chairman of Saputo\u2019s board, he is chairman of Warrnambool Cheese & Butter, and a director at National Bank of Canada and Global Dairy Platform.\n\nMemberships Saputo is chairman of the Sacre-Coeur Hospital Foundation and Montreal Heart Institute Foundation, and a member of the Quebec Cystic Fibrosis Association, Fondation Armand-Frapper, Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal and Fondation scolaire. Saputo Inc.\n\nFPM: So why go through all that hassle? You could have a nice business just sitting here in Canada, right? Saputo: That is true, and it could be very stable, but it will have no growth in it. If you look at our track record, when we went public in 1997 we were selling $450 million, primarily being a Canadian supplier of dairy foods throughout the country. Today, we\u2019re selling in excess of $15 billion in sales. That would not have come had we not gotten into the international markets selling to consumers who have a growing appetite for dairy. So, yes, it\u2019s possible we could have had a nice easy life here in Canada making a good amount of free cash, not having to go public, and the family having a good living. But when you\u2019re thinking about the evolution of any enterprise, you want to consider growth and you need to go where the growth is, and that growth is in the international markets. FPM: Saputo is quite well known for making a lot of acquisitions, more than 30 since going public, nine since 2015 and six in the past two years. How do you handle that? Saputo: We\u2019re very fortunate that we\u2019ve gotten very good at acquisitions. First and foremost, it\u2019s through the due diligence process that we recognize how important it is to integrate effectively. I would say that we\u2019ve looked at over 300 files and we\u2019ve only made 31 acquisitions since we went public in 1997, so we have looked at a lot of files and we\u2019ve walked away from a lot more files than we\u2019ve materialized. That\u2019s the discipline that we bring to the table. It\u2019s important for us to understand what are value-added acquisitions. What are those acquisitions that are going to make us bigger, better, stronger, and we\u2019re not afraid, as we\u2019re going through the due diligence process, if we realize that the target is not as good as we expected, to walk away. Once we get through the due diligence process and we have a deal, then we develop our road map. The road map will dictate what we expect to achieve in our first 100 days, what we expect to achieve in the first year, and what we expect to achieve in the first three years. It\u2019s not after we acquire that we try to figure out how we\u2019re going to\n\nintegrate. We start thinking about integration through the due diligence process. FPM: You\u2019ve walked away from more than 270 deals. What are you looking for? Saputo: We\u2019re looking for assets that will create value for us. That means assets that are in the right geography, so we need to be in an area where there is enough milk available for us to have an industry, first and foremost. We look for assets that have the potential to create more value for us with our ability to manage effectively the way that Saputo manages.\n\nWe look for assets and companies that are catering to a pool of clients that either we have that can complement our platform or that we don\u2019t have that can further diversify our platform. There are a lot of different variables that we look at when we\u2019re thinking about targets. They don\u2019t all have to be highly performing. Sometimes they can be underperforming and that with our know-how and our knowledge, we can turn things around, very much like we\u2019ve done with a lot of files that we\u2019ve inherited. The biggest things that scare us off would be things that are too difficult to overcome. As an example, if there is a food safety risk within that business that we don\u2019t believe we can overcome, we are definitely going to walk away. If there\u2019s an environmental risk that is too difficult for us to overcome, then at that point in time we\u2019ll also walk away. If we believe that there are too many skeletons in the closet of that organization that are too difficult to overcome, then we\u2019re prepared to walk away\n\nFPM: Australia has been a big target market. What appealed to you about that market? Saputo: Australia was very interesting. We\u2019d been looking at Australia since the early 2000s, 2001, 2002, and we only materialized a deal in 2013 so we were very patient there. Why was Australia important for us? Australia has a large milk pool. They have dairy farmers that have been in the business generation to generation, so you think about dairy farmers that are in their fifth and sixth generation. That means that their infrastructure for high-quality dairy solids is there. But something very interesting about Australia is that 50% of their overall production was being exported and they got to the international markets ahead of anybody else. Even though we work competing against Australia in international markets from our platform in the U.S. and our platform in Argentina, we were always being compared to the Australian dairy product because they were there first. We knew that if we wanted to be a credible international player in dairy, we needed to have a platform in Australia, because, No. 1, we could offer those dairy goods to consumers who absolutely wanted product from Australia, and No. 2, it was the right platform because of the heritage and lineage that was there and it added more diversity to our abilities to engage with consumers around the world, especially the Pacific Rim. FPM: Do people look at companies in Canada with that kind of acquisition appetite or is it just too regulated? Saputo: The dairy space is way too regulated. Canada does not have the ability to export because of the high milk cost and I\u2019m certainly not complaining about Canada because it is a great platform for us and offers us the ability to cater to the Canadian consumers, but Canada is not an international player at all, by any stretch of the imagination. FPM: You don\u2019t criticize Canada\u2019s dairy supply chain at all, but you\u2019re obviously a free trade champion. Saputo: Absolutely.\n\nFPM: How do you reconcile those two things? Saputo: We\u2019re not at the farm level, we\u2019re not dairy producers. We\u2019re dairy processors. Dairy producers understand what is most important for them to be viable. We\u2019re not going to challenge them. In Canada, if the dairy producers believe that milk supply management system makes them stronger, who are we to argue with that? I\u2019m not going\n\nto criticize the Canadian system, but a company like Saputo that is looking for growth will find that growth in other geographies. FPM: Saputo is often seen as a Canadian company that has global ambition, which often seems in short supply here. Saputo: It does, but the regulatory environment forces us to think about life outside Canada. We\u2019ve gotten there with very, very small steps. In the U.S., we took a baby step before we made a large acquisition. We acquired a plant in Vermont in 1988 and then another plant in Maryland in 1989. We had a lot of experience in the U.S. so that by the time Stella Foods came along, a company that was three times our size in 1997, we had the confidence that we knew how to navigate through the U.S. dairy landscape. We\u2019re good listeners and we\u2019re good learners. We\u2019re not overly ambitious on the first bite, but once we gain our confidence, then we go for bigger bites after that. FPM: Stepping back a little bit, a lot of people who grow up in family businesses don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. You\u2019ve pretty much been at Saputo your entire life. Why didn\u2019t you look for something else? Saputo: I started working in our plants when I was 13 years old. I remember my first jobs were just packing cheeses, then they had me sweep the floors and then clean the vats, and then I graduated to making cheeses. This happened through a lot of part-time jobs in the summer, on weekends, from when I was 13 all the way until about 19 or 20 years old. I never had the pretension to be CEO, but I always had the desire to be part of this organization because, No. 1, I love the industry, and No. 2, I love the people who are in this organization. I love the culture, I love the values, that this was an extension of my own personality. The way that I was brought up at home was the way that our company was run, so I knew that the fit was perfect for me. That\u2019s the reason why I wanted to be in this business. FPM: How has the business changed? Saputo: In the early days, I have to say that things were a little complicated, because we were a family-owned business. My father and our family were the major owners of the business with over 60% of the shares, but we also had other owners that were my aunts and uncles and cousins and so things were complicated up until 1997. Up until 1997, our board of directors was made up of exclusively family members and, as you might appreciate with a family business, not all decisions are based on common sense and logic. There\u2019s a lot of emotion. In 1997, the IPO really was to provide us the governing structure that made sure that this company would go beyond generation one and generation two, and go into generation three and beyond. It was at that point in time that everybody became accountable \u2014 everyone. But we are very fortunate that the family spirit that drove every single one of our decisions in 1954 still does exist.\n\nFPM: How does that lineage show up in the business today? Saputo: It\u2019s the culture that defines it. Its character, who we are, how we treat people first and foremost. A lot of companies say that, but we live it every single day. Every single one of our employees is an extended member of our family and we treat them that way. We don\u2019t have a problem speaking frankly and honestly and openly with our employees. There are certain things that we can do and other things that we cannot do, but we take the time to explain why there are certain things we can do and why there are certain things we can\u2019t do. This culture, these values, the way we like to speak about it internally at Saputo, are non-negotiable. This is who we are and, if the fit is right, people can look to us not just to provide them a job but to give them a career. But if the fit is not right, people will sense it right away and they\u2019ll look for a career some place else. We\u2019re very open and honest about that and we\u2019re very candid about our expectations from a cultural standpoint. FPM: Instead of having family squabbles, though, you\u2019ve got investors now to worry about, like when your stock fell in June after the Q4 results. What don\u2019t investors get when they\u2019re reading the news? Saputo: That\u2019s exactly why you\u2019ve got volatility in any stock, because you do have some investors that are thinking about the short term. I feel very, very good about where we sit. Our balance sheet is very clean, and our ability to integrate is very good. There are, from time to time, headwinds in the industry and we\u2019ve gone through a period now of about 24 months where there were plenty of headwinds in our industry. We\u2019re coming out of that phase, but those headwinds provided us opportunity to make acquisitions. That\u2019s because our industry was in turmoil and our balance sheet was clean and we were able to take advantage of that. But to weather the storm and come out of it in a better situation, the future is much brighter. Not all investors are that patient. FPM: Did you have any worries about being the third generation of a family business? Saputo: You always have to think about that. You know the adage, \u201cRags to riches to rags in three generations,\u201d and I don\u2019t want to be the third generation that brings in that factor. I\u2019m mindful of that every single day so I don\u2019t take anything for granted at all. It forces me to work a little harder.\n\nFPM: How would you describe your leadership style? Saputo: I would have to say that I like to be extremely thorough without paralyzing myself with analysis. I like to be in the markets, I like to meet our employees and understand what\u2019s going on in the field. I like to meet our customers and understand what\u2019s relevant to them. I like to meet with the different dairy industry players to see where their heads are at and how the industry is evolving, so I\u2019m thorough that way. But once I\u2019ve got the information that I need, I don\u2019t mind pulling the trigger to make decisions effectively and efficiently. If we make a mistake, whether it\u2019s myself or my management team, there\u2019s no issue there as long as we turn around quick enough to correct the mistake and try not to repeat the same mistake twice. I\u2019m also not afraid to make changes if we need that as well. FPM: You\u2019ve mentioned culture a few times and I know that you\u2019re a hockey player and a goalie, specifically. Not a whole lot of people want to be a goalie when they\u2019re 53. You are and I am, but is there anything about being a goalie that helps you in being a leader? Saputo: Absolutely, and you probably connect with this as well: the puck stops with you. No matter how many mistakes the people in front of you make, if the puck\u2019s in the net, it\u2019s on you. I love that pressure and I love that responsibility. Yes, it\u2019s also a lonely position, just like sometimes when you\u2019re a CEO it is a lonely position. Although you\u2019re well supported with people around you, at the end of the day, you\u2019re responsible for the success and the failure of the organization. Just like when you\u2019re on the ice, you\u2019re responsible for the success and the failure of the team. I thrive on that. FPM: How did you get to become a goalie? I\u2019m always interested in goalie origin stories. Saputo: When I was about six years old, I was playing for a team in my municipality, which was Dollard-des-Ormeaux, and in those days you didn\u2019t have a designated goalie. The equipment was owned by the municipality and every day the coach would come in and say, \u201cOkay, who wants to be in net today?\u201d Sure enough, when it was my turn to be in net, I had a great game. I got a shutout on my first outing and I never left the position.\n\nSelecting Canada\u2019s Outstanding CEO of the Year The Award Celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, Canada\u2019s Outstanding CEO of the Year award was established by executive search firm Caldwell Partners International Inc. in 1990.
