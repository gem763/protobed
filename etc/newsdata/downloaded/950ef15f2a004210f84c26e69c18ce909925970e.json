He will receive high quality veterinary care while recovering from the experience,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe institute also assured members of the public that the zoo, officially known as the National Zoological Gardens (NZG), had a rapid response strategy and followed specific protocols for such eventualities.\n\n\"The NZG has highly qualified staff members trained to handle such incidents. It has signage explaining to visitors what to do in the event of an animal escaping. We can confirm that no one was in danger.\"\n\nThe bachelor is part of a group of males who form part of the European endangered species programme. They arrived at the zoo in 2010.\n\nBinga was currently in his midlife span and had been spending most of his time with Bonsenga, a dominant male in the group, the institute said. However, Binga is known to be reserved and shy.\n\nAn investigation was currently underway to determine how he had managed to escape from his enclosure, the institute said, adding corrective measures would be implemented thereafter.\n\n\"SANBI wishes to take this opportunity to thank our trained emergency response team and veterinarians for their swift response and professionalism in handling this situation.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
