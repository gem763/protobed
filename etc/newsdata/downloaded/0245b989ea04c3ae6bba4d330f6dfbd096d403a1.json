Batten disease is a rare genetically-inherited disease, caused by waste build-up in the cells which creates neurodegnerative effects including: Blindness\n\nSeizures\n\nPersonality changes\n\nDementia\n\nLoss of motor skills and the ability to walk, talk and communicate Because it is a rare disease, it is often difficult to diagnosed and untested at birth. There are 14,000 children worldwide that are diagnosed with the disorder. The Batten Disease Family Association estimate that around up to 17 people are diagnosed with a form of the disease each year. There are between 100 \u2013 150 affected individuals currently living with Batten disease in the UK. There is currently no known cure available for Batten disease.\n\nThere is currently no cure for the CLN2 form of the condition - the type that Reece has. Without treatment, life expectancy ranges from between six and 13.\n\nCLN2 is estimated to strike only 30 to 50 children in the UK \u2013 around a fifth of all Batten disease patients.\n\nMs Mitchell had worked as a classroom assistant at Inverness College for almost 20 years before her son became poorly.\n\nAnd her daughter Alex Brown, 16, has paused her dreams to go to university because of her brother's crippling condition.\n\nThe Record reports that Reece was first diagnosed with autism and epilepsy in 2017 - but his seizures worsened in severity.\n\nDoctors conducted numerous bran scans and blood tests, which eventually led to him being diagnosed with CLN2 in August 2018.\n\nLocal MSP Kate Forbes, who has been assisting the family since the start of the year, said Reece is the 'quite possibly the bravest boy I have ever met'.\n\nMs Mitchell is now fundraising \u00a360,000 online for special adaptions to their house to create a large enough downstairs area for vital medical equipment.\n\nLocal council bosses reportedly refused an extension to their current home - and Ms Mitchell fears 'uprooting' him now 'would be awful'.\n\nThe NHS last month struck a deal for a life-extending drug for CLN2, after agreeing a 'fair price' following two years of fierce negotiations.\n\nHealth watchdogs previously rejected cerliponase alfa, marketed as Brineura \u2013 the only available medication to treat it, saying it was too expensive.\n\nLocal council bosses reportedly refused an extension to their current home - and Ms Mitchell fears 'uprooting' him now 'would be awful' (pictured when he was a baby)\n\nReece is pictured her when he was just two months old\n\nReece is pictured at his home in North Kessock, near Inverness", "description": "Reece Mitchell, from a village near Inverness, has Batten disease, a cruel disorder that slowly robs children of their ability to walk, talk, think and breathe.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/08/20169336-0-image-a-14_1571988734825.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
