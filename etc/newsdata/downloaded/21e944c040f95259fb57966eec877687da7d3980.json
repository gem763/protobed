The ministry will take over the authority and inspect prosecutors after the change, they said.The reform committee also plans to end the dispatch of prosecutors to the Justice Ministry\u2019s inspection office. As of now, the ministry\u2019s chief inspector is a former senior official of the Board of Audit and Inspection, but the majority of work is being done by prosecutors. The ministry is considering sending them back to their home offices early next year, the sources said.The ministry also plans to appoint a non-prosecutor to head the Inspection Department of the Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office, according to the sources.\u201cThe current system allows prosecutors to conduct internal inspections into prosecutors,\u201d a member on the reform committee told the JoongAng Ilbo on Monday. \u201cIt can trigger unnecessary misunderstanding that the prosecution is protecting its own members. We will discuss a plan to more substantially exercise the Justice Ministry\u2019s authorities to scrutinize the prosecution.\u201dOther members on the committee also confirmed that the ministry is mulling those plans.The reform plans were unveiled as conflict between Cho and Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl escalated in recent weeks. The prosecution has announced its own reform measures to defy public criticism that it is resisting the changes being forced by Cho and his reform committee.Appointed by President Moon Jae-in last month to push forward the reform of the state prosecution agency, Cho launched the 16-member committee on Sept. 30 and named Kim Nam-joon, a progressive lawyer, as its chairman. Kim had served as the deputy head of a liberal advocacy group, Lawyers for a Democratic Society, and as a member of Moon\u2019s presidential campaign. The committee includes incumbent prosecutors and investigators as well as professors and lawyers.Kim told the JoongAng Ilbo on Monday that the committee members will discuss the changes concerning inspections of the prosecution and other reform measures later in the afternoon and prioritize them.\u201cWe have not made a final conclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will create a recommendation to the minister after the meeting.\u201dLawyer Lee Tahney, a member on the committee, said last week that the ministry will consider overhauling the current inspection system of the prosecution.\u201cJudges and prosecutors must not submit to collective interests of their own and unfair directives,\u201d Lee wrote on his Facebook post on Friday. \u201cIn order to thoroughly and sternly hold prosecutors accountable for their legal violations and ethical breaches, the reform committee will discuss changes of the current inspection system.\u201dLast month, Cho also gave an order that the ministry must actively exercise its authority to inspect the prosecution. He made the directives on Sept. 11 during a meeting with senior officials.The prosecution is angry about these plans pushed forward by Cho and the reform committee and say the ministry\u2019s inspection over the prosecutors could jeopardize the integrity of investigations.\u201cThe prosecution was given the power for internal inspections over prosecutors in order to protect the integrity of investigations,\u201d a lawyer who was in charge of supervising inspection operations at the Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office said. \u201cThere have been concerns that the Ministry of Justice\u2019s active exercise of the inspection authority over the prosecution would obstruct the prosecutors\u2019 probes into powerful figures.\u201dOthers said the timing is inappropriate, because the prosecution is currently conducting investigations into the suspected crimes committed by Cho\u2019s family.\u201cProsecutors are the most sensitive about inspections and appointments,\u201d said a former senior prosecutor, currently practicing as a lawyer. \u201cA closest associate of the president was appointed as the justice minister, and the ministry is now planning to conduct inspections over the prosecution. That makes the prosecutors really uncomfortable.\u201dMeanwhile, Prosecutor General Yoon urged the senior prosecutors on Monday for a bold, proactive reform.\u201cWe must check the entire operation of the prosecution and make bold improvements on how we exercise prosecutorial powers, conduct investigations and maintain internal culture,\u201d Yoon was quoted as saying during a meeting of the senior members of the Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office. \u201cWe must boldly and proactively reform within the scope of the constitution, using the perspective of the people.\u201dFollowing Yoon\u2019s directives, the prosecution announced Monday that it will stop questioning witnesses and suspects after 9 p.m.It was the third reform measure announced by the prosecution, following the first two announcements last week. On Oct. 1, the prosecution said it will shut down special investigation departments, responsible for high-profile, often political, cases at nationwide prosecutors\u2019 offices, except for three key units. The prosecution also announced Friday that it will stop informing the media in advance about the summoning of suspects and witnesses.Yoon\u2019s directives on Monday were given only 30 minutes after Cho told the media that he will push forward a harsh reform of the prosecution from the perspective of the people. \u201cThe Justice Ministry and the prosecution must not exist to serve its own organizations and the judicial cartel,\u201d Cho also said.While Yoon and Cho both promised to reform the prosecution, their confrontation is actually intensifying.\u201cWhile his family is being investigated, Cho is trying to maintain his title as the minister by stressing that he is the best person to reform the prosecution,\u201d a lawyer who once served as a head of a district prosecution said. \u201cThe prosecution, however, is presenting self-reform measures to defy Cho\u2019s justification.\u201dAlthough Yoon presented a series of self-reform measures, Cho and the Justice Ministry did not welcome them. The Justice Ministry is on the upper chain of command of the prosecution, and Yoon must not unilaterally make a decision and announce it, the ministry officials said. \u201cInstead of making an announcement, the prosecution must submit the reform plans to the ministry,\u201d an official said.Prosecutors, however, complain that the ministry\u2019s position is against President Moon\u2019s directives issued to Yoon on Sept. 30 that the prosecution must act independently for reform.\u201cThe prosecution wants to make clear that the probes into Cho and his family are not to obstruct his reform measures,\u201d a Supreme Prosecutors\u2019 Office official said. \u201cWe are pushing forward reforms from the perspective of the people.\u201dBY PARK TAE-IN, SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
