A spokesperson for the U.S. mission in Berlin said the 2019 budget was $153 million.\n\nThe announcement comes as relations between the U.S. and Germany have become strained over issues ranging from trade policy to defense spending. U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vociferous critic of Germany's failure to meet the 2 percent NATO spending target and has threatened to slap tariffs on German cars.\n\nThe embassy in Berlin, which manages a network of diplomatic outposts in D\u00fcsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich, insists it can still carry out its functions despite the frugal spending.\n\n\"Through continuous analysis of our operations and goals, we have been able to meet emerging requirements through efficiencies and reprogramming existing resources as needed,\" said Grenell.", "description": "The mission came in $14 million under its budget for 2019, Richard Grenell said.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner", "Paul Dallison", "Caitlin Oprysko", "Hans Von Der Burchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1160158629-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
