He tweeted, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMorey subsequently deleted his tweet and issued an apology after the Chinese Basketball Association\u2019s suspension of business dealings with the Houston Rockets. The National Basketball Association (NBA), headed by Adam Silver, also acquiesced to Chinese state pressure.\n\nBreitbart News highlighted the Houston Rockets\u2019 business interest in China:\n\nThe NBA in general and the Rockets in particular, have several highly lucrative business arrangements. The communist country is a fast-growing NBA market and the Rockets, thanks largely to Yao Ming\u2019s career in Houston, are one of the most popular teams in the world\u2019s most populous nation.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the Houston Rockets \u2026 what\u2019s going on there is they are now weaponizing our companies against us,\u201d said Chang of China\u2019s political influence over U.S.-based companies.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nChang added, \u201cThe Houston Rockets, what they did was despicable, but you can\u2019t expect the Houston Rockets to stand up to the Communist Party of China, so this type of thing was inevitable, and it\u2019s occurred, of course, with Marriot some of the other hotel chains, and of course, with Hollywood.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the real story here is not that business executives are craven,\u201d continued Chang. \u201cThe story here is that Beijing is weaponizing companies, that they are demanding obedience, and they are demanding that American companies \u2014 and we\u2019re going to see this pretty soon \u2014 implement Communist Party politics to undermine American policy.\u201d\n\nChang stated, \u201cWe can\u2019t have two things at the same time. We can\u2019t have businesses in China, and we can\u2019t have a free marketplace of ideas in the United States. You can have one, but you can\u2019t have both at the same time, and because we need to protect our democracy, I think we need to get our companies out of China.\u201d\n\nChang remarked, \u201cYes it does make us less efficient, but nonetheless, You can\u2019t compare efficiency against national survival.\u201d\n\nChang commented on the status of ongoing protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cEffectively, there\u2019s martial law in Hong Kong, right now,\u201d said Chang. \u201cThe police are acting in an unrestricted fashion. They can do what they want. For instance, my friend, the war correspondent Michael Yong, reports that the police will routinely board buses and check identification papers, [and] take off people they don\u2019t like. So essentially, the police are running Hong Kong, right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that Hong Kong people are acting in defiance,\u201d noted Chang. \u201cOn Friday, Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, issued an emergency order that people were no longer allowed to wear masks in public, and we saw on Sunday, a lot of people \u2014 not just the young people dressed in black who normally have riot gear on \u2014 but also the middle class, the mass of Hong Kong people, they went out in public with masks on.\u201d\n\nChang went on, \u201c[These were] 74-year-old grannies who were doing this in a show of defiance, so Hong Kong, right now, is certainly not under the control of Carrie Lam, but the Hong Kong police are trying to establish some sort of foothold of control.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one thing that Xi Jinping is most afraid of is contagion,\u201d estimated Chang. \u201cHe knows that people in the mainland don\u2019t sympathize with the Hong Kong protesters or with Hong Kong people, in general, but he is worried that people will be inspired by their actions. You\u2019ve got to remember that the people in Hong Kong have pushed Carrie Lam around. They got her to permanently withdraw the extradition bill which triggered these protests in April, and people in the mainland have their own grievances.\u201d\n\nChang concluded, \u201cI\u2019m sure that Xi Jinping is really deathly concerned that there will be protests throughout the mainland.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "Recent events between the Houston Rockets and China illustrate China's weaponizing of U.S.-based companies against America, said Gordon Chang.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/c079d1_japan-rockets-raptors-basketball-83605-adam-silver-nba-commissioner-adam-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
