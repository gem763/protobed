Here they are: Sincere congratulations for ridding the world of a sadistic butcher who richly deserved his fate.\n\nAD\n\nThe problem is, though, that one battlefield success did not erase 33 months of presidential behavior that many, if not most, Americans consider outrageous and worthy of impeachment. The smile and wave that Trump offered those baseball fans did not rescind the vicious, snarling rhetoric he spews on a daily basis, including his recent description of Republicans who oppose him as \u201chuman scum.\u201d The flicker of vulnerability that played across Trump\u2019s face when he heard all the booing probably softened few hearts, if any.\n\nAD\n\nThis is not a reality show like \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d in which all is forgotten between episodes and alliances are formed or abandoned in the blink of an eye. Trump may not recall the abuse he heaped on perceived adversaries last week, last month or last year. Those on the receiving end, however, definitely remember.\n\nI agree with those who say that the office of the president deserves respect even if the person occupying that office does not. But I add a caveat, which is that the president himself must understand his relationship with the American people, which is one of service: He works for us. Every president I have met has spoken of how humbling the job is. Trump appears to see humility not as a gift but as a weakness. If the president will not humble himself, the people must do it for him.\n\nAD\n\nWe have been here before. Back during the Nixon administration, it was possible to drive right past the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. As Watergate reached its crescendo, protesters would stand on the sidewalk holding signs that said, \u201cHonk if you want him impeached.\u201d Motorists sent up such a cacophony that some were given $5 traffic tickets for \u201cexcessive noise.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about democracy: People have a right to tell their leaders what they think of them. If your constituents believe you have betrayed their trust, they will let you know.\n\nIf Trump was genuinely unprepared for the hostile reception, it might be because he is accustomed to the adulation of the crowds at his political rallies. The red baseball caps that the crowd wore Sunday night did not say \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d They bore the curly \u201cW\u201d of the hometown baseball team and were worn mostly by residents of Washington and its suburbs, which constitute a Democratic stronghold. It has been a long time since Trump exposed himself this way in hostile political territory, and it may be a long time before he does so again. My guess is that he will put it down to eternal hostility on the part of \u201cthe swamp\u201d or \u201cthe deep state.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd that is a shame. \u201cWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,\u201d says the King James version of the holy book Trump claims to read. We\u2019ve seen no evidence of self-awareness from Trump, but we must keep hope alive.\n\nAD\n\nThere are those who will argue that treating Trump in this manner is a political gift to him \u2014 that it will fire up his loyal base by giving evidence to support his narrative of being unfairly victimized, in this instance by elite coastal baseball fans. My view is that Trump is going to inflame his base one way or another, no matter what his political opponents say or do. He obviously has no respect for the traditional boundaries of civic debate. Those who seek to defeat him will not do so while ever-so-carefully walking on eggshells.\n\nYes, it is a sad day when the president of the United States cannot attend a World Series game without getting booed. It is also a sad day when the president mocks the Constitution, bulldozes all political norms and commits a host of impeachable offenses. This may not be how we would like things to be, but it\u2019s how they are.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "There was a time when a president could attend a game and not be booed.
