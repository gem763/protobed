Ahead of his upcoming Australian tour later this month, Dylan Moran (pictured) reflected on one of his more macabre jokes about coming Down Under to kill a Wiggle\n\n'You once said that you'd only go to Australia to kill a Wiggle, I'm assuming you're still on the hunt,' co-host Tommy Little asked the comedian, who was in the studio.\n\n'Are they still around?' Dylan replied without facial expression, before adding: 'I'm older now, more mellow. If I saw one, I'd threaten them and not actually do anything.'\n\nAs the audience burst intro laughter, the comedian maintained his vacant expression, before co-host Waleed Aly added: 'Did you have a Wiggle in mind?'\n\nStill looking? During the interview, co-host Tommy Little (right) asked Dylan (left) whether he was still looking for a Wiggle\n\nPlease explain! Dylan was asked to comment on his joke about the Wiggles (original members pictured), which he made during a set back in 2016\n\nThe Black Books star replied: 'Any Wiggle would have done at the time, but you know, it wasn't very personal.'\n\nWhen Tommy asked if a Wiggle did something to him, Dylan replied: 'I felt they had an agenda. It was there. You could see it. You knew they were up to other things!'\n\n'There was an awful lot going on. There was a lot of distraction. There was something else happening,' he said, referring to the entertainers hand movements on stage.\n\nHe's not picky! The Black Books star told the panelists: 'Any Wiggle would have done at the time, but you know, it wasn't very personal'\n\nSomething not right! Dylan (pictured) said: 'I felt they (The Wiggles) had an agenda. It was there. You could see it. You knew they were up to other things!'\n\nThe segment concluded with Tommy saying he could relate because he doesn't trust grown men who wear skivvies, to which Dylan replied deadpan: 'What's a skivvy?'\n\nDylan, who was known for having a cigarette and drinking booze on stage while delivering his sets, later addressed giving up both in recent times.\n\n'It became like a job. That's honestly what it was like. It was like punching the clock. Here we go (he mimes opening a drink) I just got bored, you know,' he said.", "description": "Ahead of his upcoming Australian tour later this month, Dylan Moran reflected on one of his more macabre jokes about coming Down Under to kill a Wiggle.", "authors": ["Mark Brook For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19496506-0-image-a-44_1570632495295.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
