Aged 53, he was housed in an over-50s wing at a Yorkshire prison.\n\n\"When you look at some of the prisons, you know, they're three or four landings high, thin ladder stairways, how do you expect an elderly person to climb them?\n\n\"When they come in, you are assessed and they'll say well you should be located 'flat' but if there's no space where you going to put somebody? How can you put somebody at second or third landing? You can't, it's inhumane.\n\n\"I saw people with cancer, saw people with diabetes, long term prisoners that need their medication but can't get to their medication because the medication hatch is on the second floor and they've got to go to a lift but they can't get into the lift because there's no staff to take them.\n\n\"If you needed a wheelchair, it might take you three to four months to get a wheelchair because one had to be designed for yourself and it also had to come from the specific local authority in the area you came from.\"\n\nThe Prison Service said: \"An ageing prison population poses particular challenges, which is why we work closely with local councils and healthcare providers to make sure we meet the needs of elderly prisoners.\n\n\"Last year, a report by the chief inspector of prisons found there was good work ongoing to adapt prisons for older inmates, and we have updated guidance for governors on how to best support them.\"\n\nHowever, national chair of the POA, Mark Fairhurst, said the system was failing to meet the needs of elderly inmates.\n\n\"We need more disabled access cells situated at ground floor level. We need 24-hour healthcare and we need proper training for staff.\"\n\nAge of prison population Breakdown of age groups as of June 2002-2019\n\nAnalysis - The ageing prison population\n\nThe number of prisoners over the age of 50 has almost tripled from 4,824 in 2002, the point at which comparable records start, to 13,617 in 2019.\n\nThe overall prison population in England and Wales has risen 16% in that time.\n\nAbout 16% of prisoners were over the age of 50 as of June 2019, compared with just 7% in 2002.\n\nThe figures showed that of the 13,617 over 50s, 1,759 were at least 70.\n\nWomen made up 548 of the over 50s prisoners, including 32 aged 70 and over.\n\nPeople in their 30s are still the largest age group in prison, making up just under a third of the overall population.\n\nTougher prison sentences and the rise in the number of those convicted of historic sexual offences are believed to be part of the reason for the ageing prison population.\n\nIn 2016, 101-year-old Ralph Clarke was jailed for 13 years for committing 30 child sex offences dating from the 1970s and 80s. He was believed to be the oldest person convicted in British legal history.\n\nImage caption Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, said the issue of an ageing prison population had to be addressed\n\nDr Mary Turner, reader in health services research at Huddersfield University, said: \"People tend to get longer sentences, even in older age, now than they might have done in the past and there are now more older people going into prison than there are being released.\"\n\nShe said the situation was not sustainable.\n\n\"We can't just see these numbers going up and up and trying to cope with it in a prison environment so we're going to get to a point where we have to think of alternatives and we have to find solutions.\"\n\nShe said options could include building secure care homes and considering alternatives to custodial sentence for older offenders.\n\nPeter Clarke warned the number of men over 50 being held in jails would rise to more than 14,000 by 2022, representing 17% of the prison population.\n\n\"The Prison Service has so far has said that it's not going to develop an overall strategy to deal with this issue,\" the chief inspector of prisons said.\n\n\"When prisoners get older, less capable physically or infirm, they don't provide an escape risk, they still have to be held in custody very often and it's not to say they wouldn't present a risk to the public if they were completely at liberty.\n\n\"But the question is do they need to be held still in levels of security which are not needed for their physical capabilities and which inevitably are very expensive as well?\"", "description": "The oldest prisoner in a jail in England or Wales was aged 104, figures from this summer showed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FDFA/production/_109281056_de45.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
