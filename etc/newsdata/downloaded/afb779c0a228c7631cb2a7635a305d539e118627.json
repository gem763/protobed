The good news is that this will provide welcome security to the law-abiding. The bad news is that it provides a gold mine of security for the law-breaking.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI have grave concerns about this development since, to date, Zuckerberg and Facebook have indicated an unwillingness to cooperate in work-arounds that would preserve court-ordered access to those committing crimes via Facebook\u2019s platforms.\n\nTo be sure, Facebook normally would not be held responsible for crimes enabled by its platform, any more than Verizon is held responsible for telemarketing scams or other crimes committed over the phone. However, Verizon and other telecommunications companies routinely cooperate with court-ordered lawful interceptions of criminal telephone calls. Facebook says it soon won\u2019t be able to do so.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe reason for this pivots on who controls the \u201ckeys\u201d for end-to-end encryption. Without nerding out, understand that encryption requires a key that unlocks the gobbledegook and enables approved users to read what was encrypted in plain text. Facebook wants to hand the keys over to the user and not keep a copy. Thus, it is able to wash its hands and claim no ability to access encrypted activity on its platform.\n\nThe DOJ and FBI are requesting a compromise in which Facebook maintains a copy of the keys or provides a copy to a neutral, trusted third party that can receive and vet court-ordered subpoenas and search warrants that need access to real bad guys. (Don\u2019t worry, Heather and Jason\u2019s totally awesome prom date postings remain hidden from government eyes.)\n\nSo what actually will be lost if Facebook implements this capability? While jihadis, fraudsters and gangbangers have used Facebook to advance their interests and abilities to commit crimes, DOJ has correctly focused on the primary abusers of Zuckerberg\u2019s playground.\n\nWe refer to them, too politely, as child pornographers or child exploiters. This glosses over the horridness of what\u2019s going on. The next few paragraphs describe with some clarity what the FBI and law enforcement see on a daily basis. It is not for the squeamish, so fair warning. But this is what will be lost if Facebook implements its plan \u2014 and Americans deserve to fully comprehend the impact.\n\nFacebook and Instagram are being exploited by evil men in three main ways. First, they provide a treasure trove of candid images of millions of children. Understand this, parents: When you post an image of your child on the internet, you lose control of it. It is a hunting ground, refreshing daily, for the disgusting among us.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImages of your adorable 7-year-old daughter, niece or granddaughter are available to be randomly harvested by a child pornographer, manipulated via the marvels of modern software into an image of nudity, and then traded among a community of evil men for their own barbarous gratification. This is routinely done.\n\nSecond, men who have direct access to children from infants to pre-pubescents \u2014 sicko dads, boyfriends, uncles, neighbors, even nanny boyfriends \u2014 will use their smartphones to anonymously video record their savage rape and molestation of babies and toddlers.\n\nThis special group of hell-bound men will seek out children specifically under 5 years old, mainly because they\u2019re too young to recount what happened to them. This is torture, an intensively painful and terrifying experience for these young innocents. But capturing the child\u2019s tormented reaction on video is part of the perverted objective. These videos are then traded among this ghastly community via platforms such as Facebook.\n\nThird, Facebook reaches to the fingertips of many adolescents and young teens on their mobile devices who are targeted by what law enforcement calls \u201ctravelers\u201d \u2014 men who travel to meet children they have befriended online, in order to have coerced sex with them. Others will simply extort the child for nude images.\n\nFor perspective, the FBI and U.S. Postal Service had essentially eradicated child pornography in this country by the 1980s. Then along came the commercial internet and a new, more anonymous trading pathway was created.\n\nAnd so now it\u2019s a wildfire, by no means an inconsequential subset of victims who can be sacrificed to some imagined higher value of unassailable encryption for the law-abiding masses. Facebook has become the prime vector of this wildfire and, to its credit, has referred \u2014 up until now \u2014 90 percent of the 18 million suspicious reports of child endangerment that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children receives every year. That\u2019s right, 18 million. Per year. That will largely go away if Facebook follows through on its plan.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the FBI launched an undercover operation known as \u201cInnocent Images,\u201d targeting those who sexually exploit and harm children. It is the only FBI undercover operation publicly acknowledged. Its investigative techniques are widely known.\n\nThe FBI doesn\u2019t have to hide all of this because, every year, they arrest thousands of people, mostly men, who exploit and violate children. From plumbers to politicians, from construction workers to clergy of all denominations, from bankers and attorneys to doctors, from millennials to boomers, it is widespread and growing.\n\nWithout Facebook\u2019s cooperation, end-to-end encryption will significantly cripple law enforcement\u2019s ability to combat this evil, expanding swath of society. Facebook, and a horde of so-called civil liberties advocates who would have us sacrifice child torture for adult privacy, maintain that the government shouldn\u2019t be provided with a \u201cback door\u201d by communications platforms. Call it a back door, front door, trap door, it doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t think for a second that the government hasn\u2019t ensured \u201cback doors\u201d in other situations it deems of national importance.\n\nFor example, the technology exists today to totally encrypt and anonymize business payroll payments to employees and subsequent banking and investment actions that employees may take. But that would cripple the ability to tax, and so the government won\u2019t allow it.\n\nWe are not allowed to travel along a roadway without a license plate on our cars, mainly because a few violate the law with their cars while the vast majority of us do not. That license plate is a back door for law enforcement.\n\nChina most certainly will not allow Facebook to encrypt Chinese citizens\u2019 Facebook postings. Will Facebook cooperate with China but not with the U.S.?\n\nFacebook has enjoyed a unique, favored position in society. Its services are free, largely untaxed and unregulated. This has resulted in immense wealth for its founder and stockholders. They have a good-citizenship responsibility to cooperate against this heinous, growing attack on our youngest. If they refuse, more and more children will be sexually abused and their tormentors will have greater assurance of never being caught. If they refuse, their cooperation should be compelled through legislation.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray rightly points out that Facebook should not be demonized in this discussion. The demonic behavior clearly rests within the malevolent souls of the child abusers. But Facebook is a primary conduit for this evil and is on the cusp of essentially creating a virtual \u201csanctuary city\u201d for the despicable worst-of-the-worst in our society. It should not be Facebook\u2019s decision alone to make.\n\nKevin R.
