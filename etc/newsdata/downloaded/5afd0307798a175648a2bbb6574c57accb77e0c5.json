The trade war with the US has seen Chinese economic growth sink to a 27-year low\n\nIt was the weakest growth since China started reporting data by quarters in 1992, and has sent jitters around the world.\n\nThe slowdown came as:\n\nJapan's exports fall for a tenth month in a row as the trade war hit shipments;\n\nFrench car giant Renault warned of subdued demand for its cars and trucks worldwide;\n\nSavile Row tailors described being 'collateral damage' as swingeing US tariffs on EU exports, from cashmere to whisky, came into force;\n\nScottish whisky makers warned sales could drop by a fifth in a year.\n\nThe slowdown in China has been fuelled by subdued consumer spending and investment as households have tightened their purse strings.\n\nIt is also further evidence of the damage caused by a tariff war with President Trump over Beijing's trade surplus and technology ambitions.\n\nAsian stock markets declined on the figures. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.2 per cent.\n\nSavile row hit by Trump's tariffs US tariffs: Savile Row has become an unlikely victim in the ferocious trade war between Donald Trump and the European Union Savile Row is the London street that has produced the finest in men's tailoring for royalty and celebrities for hundreds of years. But yesterday it became an unlikely victim in the ferocious trade war between Donald Trump and the European Union. One tailor said they have become 'collateral damage' as the tariff on men's woollen suits entering the US is almost doubled from 13 per cent to 25 per cent. They have been put in place by Trump in retaliation for the EU giving illegal subsidies to planemaker Airbus. James Sleater, founder of Cad & the Dandy, which counts rugby player winner Mike Tindall as a client, said: 'Conversations about Airbus, Trump and Savile Row are not normally three words that go hand in hand.'\n\nThe International Monetary Fund cited the US-Chinese trade war in this week's decision to cut its 2019 global economic growth forecast to 3 per cent from 3.2 per cent.\n\nThere are hopes that relations between the world's two biggest economies could thaw.\n\nTrump agreed last week to delay a tariff hike on Chinese goods and said Beijing promised to buy up to 50bn of US farm goods.\n\nBut officials say the two sides are still working out the details. Car manufacturers are among those suffering from the fall in global demand, including in China.\n\nA profit warning from Renault sent shares tumbling 12 per cent to a six-year low yesterday.\n\nIt warned sales were likely to fall amid a general decline in demand for cars and vans. Swedish car maker Volvo also reported a fall in orders for trucks.\n\nJapan's exports shrank for a tenth straight month in September in a sign that falling demand and the US-China trade war was continuing to weigh on its shipments.\n\nCloser to home, Trump's trade war with the EU has begun to bite UK businesses, from whisky distilleries in Scotland to tailors in London's Savile Row.\n\nSome \u00a36billion worth of tariffs \u2013 with 25 per cent levies slapped by the US on a wide away of EU goods \u2013 came into force yesterday.\n\nThe Scotch Whisky Association has calculated whisky products will be hit with more than 60 per cent of the UK's total tariff bill.\n\nIt warned exports could tank 20 per cent within a year. The US accounts for almost 11 per cent of global sales of single malts.\n\nSWA chief executive Karen Betts said: 'This is very bad news for our industry.'", "description": "Chinese officials said the world's second-largest economy expanded by 6 per cent in the three months ending in September, down from the previous quarter's 6.2 per cent growth.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
