Graham released a video showing ways to destroy a cell phone, which concluded by saying that \u201cyou can always give your number to the Donald.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Trump and Graham have battled over foreign policy after Graham tweeted that the administration\u2019s decision not to retaliate militarily to Iran\u2019s downing of an American drone \u201cwas clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nTrump bristled, insisting, \u201cNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand!\u201d\n\nHe later mocked Graham\u2019s support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, asking reporters \u201chow did going into Iraq work out?\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Graham has been a loyal footsoldier even as his best friend in the Senate, the late John McCain John Sidney McCainMcSally says Senate taking 'serious look' at Trump call unlike 'partisan' House Mark Kelly outraises McSally in Arizona Senate race for third straight quarter Volker steps down as head of McCain Institute, citing Ukraine controversy MORE (R-Ariz.), engaged in a bitter feud with Trump that didn\u2019t even end with the senator\u2019s death in August 2018.\n\nPolitics has always largely explained Graham\u2019s loyalty to Trump on most issues.\n\nGraham faces reelection next year, and it makes sense for incumbent GOP senators to have the president solidly on their side.\n\nBut Graham appears to have found a fighting ground where he can push back at Trump hard on specific issues without losing the president\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had to walk kind of a fine line but I think his political position is pretty strong right. He\u2019s defending the president who is popular in his home state while differing with him on an issue where probably his base in his home state questions the president,\u201d said Vin Weber, a Republican strategist.\n\nGraham shared some insight into his thinking in an interview earlier this year with The New York Times Magazine when he made clear his reelection is very much on his mind, telling reporter Mark Leibovich, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to get reelected, you\u2019re in the wrong business.\u201d\n\nGraham also acknowledged that having an influence on the leaders who call the shots, such as Trump, is a top personal priority.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,\u201d he said.\n\nKevin Bishop, a spokesman for Graham, said other Republicans have also defended Trump on impeachment and criticized his Syria policy but noted that his boss gets more attention.\n\n\"We are vocal but we also have a bigger microphone and platform as well. We turn down 99% of the media invites we receive,\" he said.\n\nTrump has maintained solid approval numbers with base Republican voters but his decision to reposition U.S. troops, allowing Turkey to more easily attack U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in Syria, threatens to create a rift with many GOP voters, especially in South Carolina, one of the most pro-military states in the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt may be the most pro-defense state,\u201d Weber said of South Carolina, which is home to several military bases including Parris Island, the famed Marine Corps boot camp, and nearly 400,000 military veterans who make up about 10 percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nA Hill-HarrisX poll from earlier this year showed that 59 percent of registered Republican voters said they favored keeping a military presence in Syria and Senate Republicans voted overwhelmingly in February to express strong opposition to a precipitous withdrawal from Syria or Afghanistan.\n\nGraham\u2019s strategy has paid off politically.\n\nHis poll numbers were weak after his failed presidential bid, with an approval rating dipping to 16.3 percent and his unfavorable rating reached 42.1 percent, according to an average of polls compiled by HuffPost.\n\nOnly a year ago, he still faced potential primary challenges from Beaufort County Councilman Mike Covert, who opted instead to run for South Carolina\u2019s first congressional district seat and recently acknowledged that Graham is now too tough to beat.\n\nGraham\u2019s ardent defense of Trump on the impeachment front gives him some political cover to be more critical of the administration\u2019s foreign policy moves.\n\nGibbs Knotts, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston, said Graham is \u201cbeing very strategic in the decisions he\u2019s making.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just ad hoc,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strategy seems to be fighting off any challenge in a primary but also being able to be relevant with the president.\u201d\n\nKnotts said Graham had to worry about a primary challenge heading into the current election cycle but also wanted to exert influence over the president on one of his top priorities, national security policy.\n\n\u201cHe was concerned about some kind of primary challenge because amongst the core Republican voters they\u2019ve always been a little bit uncomfortable with Lindsey Graham,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think, secondarily, Graham as he said is somebody who wants to have maximum influence and he feels building that relationship with Trump is going to put him and South Carolina in a better position.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s diligent efforts to position himself as a confidante of the president have given him access to Trump that many other Republican lawmakers lack.\n\nA few months after he criticized him on Twitter, Trump told a group of reporters in February that he also listens to Graham and respects him.\n\n\u201cLindsey, you know, (on) the Middle East, he\u2019s been there many times. It\u2019s close to his heart,\u201d Trump reporters, according to a McClatchy report. \u201cPeople I respect, I listen to.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
