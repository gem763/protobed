It was the first time the foldable phone was shown. A year later at the 2019 Samsung Developer Conference in San Jose on Tuesday, there was nary a word about the Fold -- until the keynote turned to One UI 2, a software overlay for the company's phones, tablets and smartwatches. When showing off One UI 2, Samsung showed a mockup of a phone that folded in half horizontally, kind of like a flip phone.\n\nAttendees of #SDC19 got a sneak peek at a brand new form factor Samsung is exploring for the foldable category of devices. #SamsungEvent pic.twitter.com/rGtpvNj0SJ \u2014 Samsung US Newsroom (@SamsungNewsUS) October 29, 2019\n\nThis wasn't a formal announcement of a new Galaxy Fold 2 or a Galaxy Fold Square. But it does validate a story by Bloomberg that ran in September claiming that Samsung's next foldable phone would fold inward to become a compact square. The graphic on the screen showed what for all intents and purposes is a 2019 take on what a flip phone would look like.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nCuriously enough this follows on recent news by Motorola that it would be launching a foldable version of its iconic Moto Razr by the end of the year. But aside from two slides, one showing the mockup and another showing how the screen folded, there weren't any solid details about the square folding phone.\n\nIf the graphic showing the different ways Samsung's Infinity Flex displays can fold is any indication, that phone could be tall, about the same height as the current Galaxy Fold, but it would fold down to be more pocketable.", "description": "At its 2019 Samsung Developer Conference, the phone-maker showed a mockup of its One UI 2 software on what looks like a flip phone.
