If this legal battle ends with its license getting revoked, Missouri will become the first state without a licensed abortion clinic since the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling in 1973.\n\nThis terrifying legal battle over reproductive rights raises many questions, for example \u201cWhat the fuck??\u201d and \u201cFucking why????\u201d Also important to consider is what people in Missouri (or North Dakota, or Kentucky, or anyone who lives in any of the six states that only have one licensed abortion clinic left) will do when they want to get an abortion should the last remaining abortion clinic in their state shut down. How will they find a clinic, how will they get there, and how much will all of these additional obstacles cost?\n\nTo find a licensed abortion clinic near you, you can head over to the Safe Place Project, the National Abortion Federation\u2019s list of affiliated providers, or any one of a number of other similar online databases. You can also call up your local Planned Parenthood and ask them about abortion services in your area. You can have an abortion at any licensed clinic; you don\u2019t have to be a resident of the state where it\u2019s located.\n\nFinding a clinic is one thing; getting to a clinic is another. Should their local Planned Parenthood lose its license, residents of St. Louis would have to travel out of state, which has long been standard for Missourians anyway. In 2009, nearly half of all abortion patients in Kansas came from Missouri, per The New York Times, while a significant percentage of abortions in Illinois are performed on people from other states, as well. If the St. Louis Planned Parenthood closes, area residents would likely travel to a new Planned Parenthood clinic that just opened in nearby Granite City, Illinois. It takes a little more than an hour to get to Granite City from St. Louis by MetroLink and MetroBus and about another hour to get back, and costs $9 roundtrip. If a person has a car, they can get there in under 20 minutes, both ways, traffic permitting, which would cost about $2-5 in gas round trip. Not everyone can afford to take an hour or two off from work, or spare the $5 or $10 they might need to get to an out-of-state clinic. For low-income individuals, people living in abusive or otherwise precarious situations, hourly workers without paid time off, people who don\u2019t own cars, and so many others, every added mile and every added dollar could make the journey impossible.\n\nFor many people in the United States, the shuttering of a single clinic would be disastrous. Millions of Americans live in what a 2018 study in the Journal of Medical Internet Research dubbed \u201cabortion deserts,\u201d meaning they have to drive 100 miles or more to reach the nearest licensed clinic, a considerable distance that means few, if any, public transportation routes, higher fuel costs by car, and likely the ability to take time off work\u2014three needless, additional complications that no one would have to think about if licensed abortion services were accessible and affordable for all.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "Hearings over whether Missouri's last remaining abortion clinic will continue to operate began this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db749703b6eb6008d6c18e4/lede/1572292999073-GettyImages-1147168285.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.845440881763527xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
