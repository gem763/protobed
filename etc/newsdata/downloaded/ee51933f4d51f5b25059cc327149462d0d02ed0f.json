There will be tears from locals who remember when the original Senators fled in 1960; lobbyists smushing their behinds into box seats that cost more than a year at Sidwell Friends; and a lot of sleepy-eyed lawmakers making bad baseball jokes on those infernal beltway Sunday a.m. gabfests. I have it on good authority that Abe Lincoln himself is going to climb down off his monument to throw out the first pitch of Game 3. That\u2019s right: another lanky right-hander is taking the hill for the Nats. Sorry, Astros.\n\nMeanwhile, there will also be \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d We need to talk about \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d\n\nAs a parent of two small children, I\u2019ve been living with \u201cBaby Shark\u201d for what feels like 20,000 years. It\u2019s become the unofficial anthem of this magical Nationals season, now two wins away from a championship.\n\nFor the uninitiated, \u201cBaby Shark\u201d is the most diabolical musical phenomenon of the 21st century. I\u2019d assumed it was created in a lab by fiendish scientists who wanted to drive parents to the brink of madness, but word is it began as a campfire song\u2014something campers apparently would yowl to each other between mosquito bites and roasted marshmallows.\n\nIt goes a little something like this:\n\nBaby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nBaby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\n\u201cTangled Up in Blue,\u201d it is not. \u201cBaby Shark\u201d took off as a global phenomenon a few years ago, when it was remixed by the South Korean educational entertainment company Pinkfong, which weaponized the song with a snappy video and a layer of preschool adorability. Watch it for a second, and you\u2019ll soon pick up the rest:\n\nMommy shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nMommy shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nDaddy shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nDaddy shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nAnd on it goes. \u201cBaby Shark\u201d keeps escalating up the family tree, with accompanying \u201cshark bite\u201d hand signals\u2014forefinger and thumb for baby shark; two hands clapping together for \u201cmommy shark\u201d; a couple of forearms flapping for \u201cdaddy shark.\u201d There\u2019s even a dentures hand signal for \u201cgrandma shark\u201d and \u201cgrandpa shark,\u201d which seems rude; grandma and grandpa shark are probably setting aside money for baby shark\u2019s college fund.\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent of small children, I don\u2019t need to explain this to you. You already live with me in \u201cBaby Shark\u201d hell. In my home, it\u2019s still on heavy rotation. My 6-year-old has lost interest, thankfully moving to \u201cOld Town Road\u201d\u2014I would have accepted Norwegian death metal, to be honest\u2014but the 4-year-old will, at the first, buoyant beat of \u201cBaby Shark,\u201d drop whatever she\u2019s doing, sprint down the hallway, and do the whole number, hand signals, denture grandparents and all. It\u2019s the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I would also like her to stop.\n\nTo be clear: I\u2019m not trying to be a music snob about this. I have way too much Katy Perry on my phone to do that. I respect that \u201cBaby Shark is a popular song\u2014the Pinkfong video has almost four billion views on YouTube. It\u2019s just that when you hear this song, \u201cBaby Shark\u201d buys a condo inside your hippocampus, and invites you over for dinner, several times a week. Like lovelorn Jim Carrey in \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\u201d I would pay a quack doctor to put wires on my temples and erase it. (While they are at it, they can also remove \u201cMr. Roboto,\u201d \u201cRock Me Amadeus,\u201d and all of junior high.)\n\nWhich bring us to Washington, and the Nats, which adopted \u201cBaby Shark\u201d this summer when outfielder Gerardo Parra requested the song to be played before his at-bats, and Parra\u2019s and the team\u2019s fortunes started changing for the better. Baseball is a superstitious sport, so \u201cBaby Shark\u201d stayed. The Nationals remain the hottest team in baseball, currently riding an eight-game playoff win streak.\n\nYou\u2019ll see and hear plenty of \u201cBaby Shark\u201d over the weekend. Fans will chomp their hands if Parra gets an at-bat; Nats players might celebrate singles with \u201cbaby shark\u201d finger pinches, and doubles with \u201cmommy shark\u201d claps. A few Nationals fans tried to get \u201cBaby Shark\u201d going in Houston Wednesday when Parra pinch hit; Fox strangely played a non-Pinkfong, off-brand version which sounded recorded by Art Garfunkel at a Chuck E. Cheese.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mesmerizing, it\u2019s catchy, it doesn\u2019t leave you,\u201d Joe Buck said.\n\nRyan Zimmerman gives a \u2018Baby Shark\u2019 gesture. Photo: Rob Carr/Getty Images\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s sweet. \u201cBaby Shark\u201d is far from the first playoff phenomenon\u2014remember Rally Monkey, Rally Squirrel, and Fear the Beard\u2014and I support anything that makes a 4-year-old pay attention to a baseball game in 2019. It\u2019s another reason to bandwagon these Nats, who are winning the likability battle with the Astros, a good club now undercut by their tactless front office.\n\nStill, I\u2019m warning baseball fans out there: this is going to be a hard to forget. Joe Buck is right, it doesn\u2019t leave you.\n\nBaby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nBaby shark, do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nWin or lose, that shark bite lasts forever.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Rally Monkey, Rally Squirrel, Fear the Beard and Baby Shark: What has been your favorite playoff phenomenon?\n\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "description": "The World Series is on its way to Washington, D.C., and the town is bracing for a party.
