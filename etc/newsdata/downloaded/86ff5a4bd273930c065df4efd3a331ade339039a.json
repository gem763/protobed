I mean, it's not the right way man. I already told you that it's not the position that someone comes and gives you a task and you get on with it, it's a very senior level position where you need to manage the entire instance.\"\n\nAt this point, the candidate can be seen bowing his head, but he does not say anything.\n\n\"I'm sorry, you're not going to continue this interview process,\" the recruiter tells him.\n\n\"Going forward I suggest you not [take] like this. I mean you need to be very formal, at least practice before you take the interview for these kinds of things.\n\n\"I clearly caught you, you know. You're also speaking in a very low voice, syncing your lips. Okay? I'm sorry about that, thank you.\"\n\nThe video, which appeared on Mail Online , was first released in 2017.\n\nThe clip ends when one of the two men ends the Skype chat.", "description": "The candidate does not say a word when the interviewer tells him he can see he is cheating", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Youtube"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20538572.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_YouTube.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
