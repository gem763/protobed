Buzzard is the main contributor to the Forties crude stream, the largest of the five North Sea oil grades that underpin Brent crude futures.\n\nMeanwhile Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Sunday it will close the Faregh oil field at Zueitina port for scheduled maintenance from Monday until Oct. 14.\n\n(Reporting by Florence Tan Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)", "description": "By Florence TanSINGAPORE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday,  extending last week's heavy losses, with traders fearing the  global economic...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
