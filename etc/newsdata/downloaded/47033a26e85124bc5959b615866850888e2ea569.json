His mother was killed.\n\nDoctors have placed a television beside the injured infant\u2019s bed, hoping Tom and Jerry cartoons will distract Enzo as they sedate him to clean the bullet wound that nearly cost him his left foot.\n\nWhen he cries out for his mother, family members still struggle to respond. Sometimes it is Enzo\u2019s aunt he calls mum; sometimes his grandmother. Only 48 hours have passed since weeping relatives laid his mother to rest. She was 17 years old.\n\nMargareth was one of at least four innocent teenagers shot dead during police operations between 9 and 13 August \u2013 an eruption of killing that was shocking even by Brazilian standards, where there were over 57,000 homicides last year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margareth Teixeira, Daniel Coutinho and Enzo. Photograph: Family/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIn Rio, killing is a game,\u201d one local tabloid announced on its front page alongside an illustration of blood-spattered Playmobil figures symbolizing Rio\u2019s extinguished youth.\n\nThe killings are part of a broader surge in police violence playing out under Rio\u2019s hardline state governor, Wilson Witzel, who took power in January promising a frontal assault on the drug gangs who rule most of Rio\u2019s 1,000-odd favelas.\n\nOfficial figures released this week show Witzel \u2013 who hopes to succeed Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 has been true to his word, with devastating consequences for families like Margareth\u2019s.\n\nIn the first seven months of this year police caused 30% of all violent deaths in the state of Rio and killed a record 1,075 people \u2013 the highest number in more than two decades. Eighty-eight of those deaths came in the western region where Margareth and Enzo were shot.\n\nRio governor confirms plans for shoot-to-kill policing policy Read more\n\nIn July alone police killed 194 people \u2013 a rate of more than six a day \u2013 another two-decade high.\n\n\u201cIt is staggering,\u201d said Pablo Nunes, a public security specialist from Rio\u2019s C\u00e2ndido Mendes University. \u201cIt leaves me almost speechless. It is something that in any other democracy in the world would be simply unacceptable and unthinkable.\u201d\n\nWitzel has defended his so-called \u201cshoot down\u201d policy, claiming it has reduced crime and insisting \u201cno leniency\u201d can be shown to rifle-toting gangsters he compares to Nazis.\n\nIn one chilling interview Witzel urged criminals to swap their guns for Bibles, \u201cor we are going to kill you\u201d.\n\nBut activists accuse the brawny former judge of triggering a bloodbath that is claiming a growing number of civilian lives.\n\nOf the four innocent teenagers killed during recent police operations, not one was carrying a rifle.\n\nGabriel Alves, 18, was reportedly school-bound with a bag full of books. Dyogo Costa, 16, was on his way to a football training session with a pair of boots. Henrico de Menezes J\u00fanior, 19, was reportedly going to pick up his motorbike from a repair shop.\n\nAnd Margareth Teixeira, a student who dreamed of joining the police, was en route to a church service, carrying nothing but her 22-month-old boy.\n\nRenata Souza, a leftist politician and human rights activist, said every single police shooting demanded thorough investigation. \u201cBut it seems the governor has no interest in this and instead is simply becoming a populist demagogue who believes in nothing but solving violence through confrontation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy opting for confrontation and war, Governor Witzel is deliberately putting at risk the poor, who are caught defenseless in the crossfire,\u201d added Souza, who recently flew to Geneva to denounce Witzel to the UN human rights council.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rio\u2019s Favela do 48 where Margareth Teixeira was killed as she walked to church Photograph: Felipe Fittipaldi/The Guardian\n\nOn the night she died, on 13 August, Margareth set off from the home of her parents-in-law with Enzo at about 7.10pm.\n\nShe had arranged to meet his father, Daniel Coutinho, at an evangelical church in the Favela do 48 community where they lived.\n\nBut moments after she left a volley of shots rang out, as police launched an incursion supposedly intended to quell clashes between two rival gangs currently squabbling over the area.\n\n\u201cThe shooting came from nowhere,\u201d said Margareth\u2019s mother-in-law, F\u00e1tima Coutinho, who recalled thinking: \u201cMy God! Did she make it to church?\u201d\n\nWhen Coutinho reached the place of worship and couldn\u2019t find his wife, he assumed she had sought shelter from the shootout in someone\u2019s home. In fact, Margareth\u2019s bullet-ridden body had already been loaded into an armoured police vehicle and dumped at the Albert Schweitzer, along with those of two alleged gang members.\n\n\u201cThe bitch ran off together with the gangsters,\u201d one witness, who saw the bodies arrive, claimed she had been told by a police officer at the hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s why she died.\u201d\n\nDespite a public outcry over the rising body count, Witzel has shown no sign of rethinking his hardline tactics, instead blaming the killings on \u201cpseudo human rights activists\u201d who prevent police properly performing their duties.\n\n\u201cThese corpses aren\u2019t on me, they\u2019re on you, who don\u2019t let the police do the job that needs to be done,\u201d Witzel said as he was pictured punching the air and jumping for joy after a special forces sniper shot dead a bus hijacker.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wilson Witzel celebrates after a police sniper killed the kidnapper who held the occupants of a bus hostage on the Rio-Niter\u00f3i bridge, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 20 August 2019.

I buried her. But I still can\u2019t believe she is dead,\u201d he said.\n\nEnzo was discharged from hospital in late August and will be raised in his grandparents\u2019 three-bedroom home overlooking the favela where his mother lived and died.\n\nHis cot \u2013 stamped with the bright red symbol of Rio\u2019s Flamengo football club \u2013 now sits in his grandparents\u2019 room and his father will sleep next door.\n\n\u201cEnzo needs me, and I need him too,\u201d said Coutinho. \u201cNow, I\u2019m a dad and a mum.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Phillips", "description": "Rio de Janeiro police have killed a record number of people in the name of Wilson Witzel\u2019s war on drugs, and many say it\u2019s civilian lives being lost", "authors": ["Caio Barretto Briso In Rio De Janeiro"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b18e0c3d01f37bccfd281cad3b7a972b4b652c9/188_821_5801_3482/master/5801.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a198002c3fc91557a2043e2996f0766", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
