He has already told police that he committed the killings, prosecutors said.\n\nOfficers responding to a 911 call about the Oct. 5 attack found Santos carrying a metal pipe covered with blood and hair near Mulberry Street and Canal Street, police said.\n\nRandy Santos pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges during a brief excursion to court from the psychiatric ward where he is being held\n\nSantos appeared in an orange jail suit and gray undershirt with his hands cuffed behind his back\n\nThe dead ranged in age from 39 to 83, and three of them were part of a New York City homeless population that includes over 60,000 people in shelters and likely thousands more on streets, subways and other public spots.\n\nResidents would warmly greet the oldest, Chuen Kok, as \"uncle\" and often saw Anthony Manson, 49, with his laptop computer, writing a blog that touched on scripture, psychology, charity and making homelessness \"more visible to everyone who see, but don't really see.\" It took authorities nearly two weeks to identify the third homeless man, Florencio Moran, 39.\n\nThe other of the four, Nazario V\u00e1squez Villegas, had a home on Staten Island but may have fallen asleep while visiting his friends on the streets. He \"was in the wrong place and at the wrong time,\" his daughter Guadelupe said.\n\nOne body was found shortly after police responded to reports of an assault around 2am in Manhattan (crime scene pictured)\n\nA man in his 60s and a man, 49, were both found on East Bowery Street.

Another detective recognized him as the suspect in the earlier assault, Peterson said.\n\nSantos is being held without bail and was due to be returned to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital after his court appearance.\n\nHe also faces an attempted murder charge for the beating of a man who survived the Oct. 5 attack and an assault charge for a non-fatal beating about a week earlier in midtown Manhattan.\n\nSantos surrounded by his legal team as he appears in court accused of killing four men on the streets of New York City\n\nIn that case, prosecutors said, Santos beat a man who was sleeping on a bench before attempting to pick him and throw him in the Hudson River.\n\nHe has at least six prior arrests, including two last year. He is accused of punching a stranger on a subway train and choking another man at an employment agency, police said. He was arrested in May after allegedly punching a homeless man inside a Brooklyn shelter.\n\nHis mother, Fioraliza Rodriguez, 55, told the New York Daily News she had kicked him out of her home about three years ago after he assaulted her. She said she was afraid of him, but \"never thought he would kill someone.\"", "description": "Randy Santos, 24, pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges He is accused of beating four men to death in Manhattan's Chinatown area on October 5th.
