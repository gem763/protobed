I\u2019ve tried to repay him every time he\u2019s done that. Hopefully there will be four more years of success.\u201d\n\nAlexander-Arnold added: \u201cI think within his first few weeks he was down at the academy watching the young lads. That gave a bit more faith and a statement to the club he was going to give young players chances.\n\n\u201cHe has shown over the four years that he has given young players chances. He\u2019s given opportunities and I\u2019m one of the youngsters that\u2019s been given them.\u201d\n\nAlexander-Arnold only celebrated his 21st birthday this week but can already call himself a Champions League winner and the youngest player ever to start consecutive European Cup finals.\n\nThe full-back is now focused on winning more silverware, both for club and country, as he prepares for England\u2019s forthcoming European Championship qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cThe last few years have been a whirlwind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone so quickly. I never expected things to go so well, but I\u2019ve been blessed enough and lucky enough to be given the opportunities by the right managers and the right time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to take those opportunities and I\u2019ve been given more. I\u2019m just really grateful for the opportunities I\u2019ve been given.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as if you haven\u2019t won a trophy. You want to do more, that determination and hunger to win silverware never dies out.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many you win, it\u2019ll never be enough for you. You want to keep pushing to get better as a player and as a team. The aim is always to win, that\u2019s the mentality we want at the minute.\u201d", "description": "Trent Alexander-Arnold has paid a heartfelt tribute to Jurgen Klopp, claiming that he owes \u201ceverything\u201d to the Liverpool\u00a0manager as he celebrates the four-year anniversary of his appointment at Anfield.
