the party again.\n\nThe former chancellor warned Mr Johnson\u2019s deal \u201csplits Northern Ireland\u201d from Great Britain, saying: \u201cIf the whole of the UK is in a customs union, then the whole of the UK would be treated the same and the threat to the union in Northern Ireland would be gone.\u201d\n\nAnd he pointed to the risk of a crash-out Brexit, adding: \u201cThat applies as much to a no-deal exit at the end of 2020 as it does to a no-deal exit at the end of 2019.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, a government minister heightened fears of a \u201ctrapdoor\u201d in little over a year \u2013 if a hard Brexit is pursued \u2013 admitting no-deal would \u2018always\u201d be an option.\n\nMr Hammond also rejected Mr Johnson\u2019s push for a 12 December election, saying: \u201cI shall be voting against it \u2013 this is not the time for a general election.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address
