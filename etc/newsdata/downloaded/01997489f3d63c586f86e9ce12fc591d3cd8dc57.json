The workers made it appear they were keeping up with their workload when they were not.\n\nMidlevel managers told higher-ups by 2014 that an ambitious program director was pressuring people to burnish on-time results, according to sworn testimony from utility employees to a California regulator.\n\nThe utility\u2019s response? It removed the midlevel managers, promoted the program director and reported as fact figures it had been given reason to doubt, according to the testimony and a state investigative report.\n\nConfronted by state regulators, who plan hearings on the episode this fall, PG&E said it had provided the best information it had. It said employee conduct \u201cfell short of the high standards of integrity and the ethical action to which the company is committed.\u201d\n\nIt was no anomaly. The Wall Street Journal identified repeated instances over 25 years in which PG&E misled regulatory authorities, withheld required information, didn\u2019t follow through on promised improvements, engaged in improper back-channel communications with regulators or obstructed an investigation.\n\nThe company has paid more than $2.6 billion in state and federal penalties and lawsuit settlements in such cases. While the penalty came to less than $1 million in about a half-dozen of the incidents, it was much more in other cases, some of them involved death and heavy property destruction, and regulators consider all violations that involve safety to be serious matters. Asked about the cases, the company said they were part of the public record and it had little additional comment.\n\nA fire roared through a San Bruno, Calif., neighborhood after a PG&E gas-pipeline explosion on Sept. 9, 2010, killing eight and destroying dozens of houses.

PG&E also is under federal probation, following felony convictions for violating gas pipeline safety laws in a San Bruno, Calif., explosion that killed eight people and for obstructing a federal investigation.\n\nSeveral close observers of PG&E said they witnessed a pattern of conduct over the years that troubled them because it seemed to violate norms of behavior for California utilities. \u201cPG&E, in comparison to others, stands apart,\u201d said Mark Ferron, a former member of the California Public Utilities Commission.\n\nFor years, he said, PG&E seemed to play a \u201ccat and mouse game\u201d with regulators of doing what it wanted and waiting to see if it got caught, which he said was unfortunate because the utilities commission \u201cis not a particularly adroit cat.\u201d\n\nCatherine J.K. Sandoval, another former utilities commissioner and now a Santa Clara University law professor, said PG&E has \u201ca trust issue and a conduct issue,\u201d and it violates rules of conduct so often it amounts to a pattern. \u201cThey are definitely the worst\u201d among the utilities she oversaw, she said.\n\nA federal judge, William Alsup, referred in a January order to what he called \u201cPG&E\u2019s history of falsification of inspection reports.\u201d\n\nSuch behavior, persisting through multiple corrective-action plans, reorganizations and five chief executives, complicates things for the public officials now overseeing the company. Their problem is how to restore both solvency and safety to a critically important institution\u2014it provides gas and electricity to more than 16 million people\u2014if they can\u2019t trust it to do what it says and it doesn\u2019t seem to be chastened by penalties or public shaming.\n\n\u201cThe commission has tried to rein PG&E in using the traditional tools of regulation\u2014increasing fines and removal of responsible parties\u2014and those tools haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Darwin Farrar, chief counsel of the state utilities commission\u2019s Public Advocates Office, in an email. Mr. Farrar wrote in a July public filing that PG&E \u201chas dealt with the Commission dishonestly.\u201d\n\nFor new leaders who joined the big San Francisco utility in April, including 10 directors and a new chief executive, it adds up to the central challenge of winning back trust as they try to pull the company out of its deep hole.\n\nThe demolition of a PG&E power plant at Bakersfield, Calif., led to a fatal worker injury. PG&E was later penalized $5.6 million for not adequately monitoring a contractor\u2019s work. Photo: Casey Christie/The Bakersfield Californian/Zuma Press\n\nCEO Bill Johnson said in an interview he is committed to \u201ctransparency and openness and telling the truth as fast as we can.\u201d\n\nHe noted that PG&E is an old company, and \u201cthings accrete over time.\u201d Asked about its record of sometimes being less than forthright with regulators and the public, Mr. Johnson didn\u2019t address that notion directly but said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be slippery, and we will make decisions based on what\u2019s best to serve our customers.\u201d\n\nPG&E Penalties and Settlements Through the Years\n\nChairwoman Nora Mead Brownell acknowledged the company\u2019s reputation is badly damaged. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it very clear that we, personally and professionally, have to have the highest standards of truthfulness and honesty,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Johnson and the new directors arrived not long after Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the operating unit of PG&E Corp. , filed for bankruptcy protection in January for the second time in two decades, citing fire liabilities. The utilities commission since 2015 has been studying what to do about PG&E\u2019s safety culture. According to state fire officials, its record includes accidentally starting fires that killed 107 people in 2017 and 2018, destroyed 22,000 buildings and burned 350,000 acres.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What does PG&E, which is in bankruptcy court, need to do to get back on track and improve its safety record? Join the conversation below.\n\nOn July 10, Judge Alsup, overseeing PG&E\u2019s federal probation, ordered the company to respond, paragraph by paragraph, to a Journal article saying PG&E long knew it had power lines that could spark fires but failed to perform necessary upgrades to towers and other equipment. The judge told the company to give him a clear answer and not bury him in thousands of pages of records, which he said it had done in the past.\n\nIn its response, PG&E acknowledged it had long known its aged high-voltage lines could fail and trigger fires, and had delayed some upgrades to the line that broke in November and sparked the Camp Fire that ravaged the town of Paradise. But PG&E denied it had neglected maintenance, saying the delayed upgrades weren\u2019t related to maintenance but rather to design, such as the height of lines above the ground.\n\nCandor Deficiency 1997: PG&E penalized $14 million for withholding data from state and environmental regulators about harm to sea life from nuclear power plant\u2019s cooling system.\n\nPG&E penalized $14 million for withholding data from state and environmental regulators about harm to sea life from nuclear power plant\u2019s cooling system. 2013: $14.35 million for waiting seven months to tell state authorities of incorrect information about a gas pipeline.\n\n$14.35 million for waiting seven months to tell state authorities of incorrect information about a gas pipeline. 2018: $2.7 million penalty after contractor lost control of critical cyber-asset database and utility was described by federal agency as not forthright with investigators. See all: PG&E Penalties and Settlements Through the Years\n\nTwenty-two years earlier, in a makeshift courtroom at the defunct Bouzy Rouge Saloon in Nevada City, Calif., PG&E faced criminal charges stemming from a different fire. Though that one was relatively small, the case raised an integrity issue as prosecutors presented evidence PG&E for years asked for money for tree trimming but then diverted millions for other things.\n\n\u201cUtility managers and contractors urgently warned upper-level management that these cutbacks were causing dangerous conditions,\u201d former prosecutor Jenny Ross said in a recent interview. \u201cPG&E has always talked a good game about safety,\u201d she said, but \u201cthey cut corners.\u201d\n\nA jury convicted PG&E in 1997 of more than 700 misdemeanors, many involving power lines in contact with trees. It was fined $2 million.\n\nIn 1996 and 2006, PG&E settled lawsuits alleging it contaminated drinking-water sources in and around Hinkley and Kettleman City, Calif., with a carcinogenic form of chromium and deceived residents\u2014agreeing to pay about $628 million in the cases that made legal clerk Erin Brockovich famous. Ms. Brockovich now is helping victims of the Camp Fire sue the utility.\n\nErin Brockovich, seen in September 2000, played a key role in litigation against PG&E over groundwater contamination with a carcinogenic form of chromium.

Johnson/Associated Press\n\nFollowing a series of contractor deaths and injuries, PG&E said in a 2015 settlement with regulators it understood it couldn\u2019t delegate its safety responsibilities. It pledged to pre-qualify all contractors and subcontractors who would be doing risky work on its behalf and monitor job sites, and said this plan was implemented by the end of 2016.\n\nThree and a half months later, a tree trimmer named Jorge Moctezuma Garcia climbed a dead Ponderosa pine in Twain Harte, a town in the Sierra Nevada. Up 94 feet, he positioned himself to top the 136-foot tree\u2019s spire.\n\nSuddenly, crew members heard a loud crack and the tree snapped, throwing the 21-year-old to the ground. He died of traumatic injuries. It was his second day on the job.\n\nMr. Garcia\u2019s employer was Kentucky-based Action Tree Service LLC, a subcontractor to PG&E contractor Trees Inc. Action Tree couldn\u2019t provide documentation Mr. Garcia had received skills-and-safety training, according to a state investigative report, reviewed by the Journal after a public-records request.\n\nThe report also said Action Tree didn\u2019t have the necessary workers\u2019 compensation and liability insurance. In addition, it said a firm that did a tree survey had recommended using a crane for removing this one.\n\nAction Tree\u2019s owner, Nicholas Downey, said he didn\u2019t know until after the accident that a crane was recommended. He said he thought he had insurance, but he said his broker never obtained it. He said his company tested Mr. Garcia and felt his skill level was adequate.\n\nMr. Garcia\u2019s mother and his widow, living in Mexico, filed a negligence suit. PG&E and Trees Inc., now called Trees LLC, settled in October 2018 with what people with knowledge of the matter said was a payment to the family. Mr. Garcia\u2019s sister, Elvia Moctezuma Garcia, said her brother was trying to earn enough to build a small house in Mexico for his bride.\n\nPG&E said it is \u201calways concerned about the safety and health of our employees, contractors and customers,\u201d and it continues to share \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d with Mr. Garcia\u2019s family.\n\nMisuse of Contractors 2015: PG&E paid a $5.6 million penalty for not adequately monitoring a demolition project in which a contractor was fatally injured.\n\nPG&E paid a $5.6 million penalty for not adequately monitoring a demolition project in which a contractor was fatally injured. 2016: A $5.4 million penalty for improper gas-system inspections by unqualified contractors, not promptly notifying regulators when it found out. See all: PG&E Penalties and Settlements Through the Years\n\nThe incident that led to PG&E\u2019s federal probation was a 2010 pipeline explosion and fire in San Bruno, Calif., that killed eight people and destroyed or damaged more than 100 houses. PG&E told a court that nearby sewer-line work could have damaged its \u201cstate-of-the-art pipeline.\u201d In fact, PG&E\u2019s pipeline was so defective the company must have overlooked or ignored welding standards when building it out of scraps a half-century earlier, the National Transportation Safety Board said after an investigation.\n\nOne of 2,425 violations for which the state utilities commission penalized PG&E $1.6 billion was impeding its investigation and giving it false information.\n\nPG&E said it was unaware of records inaccuracies before the accident, and said its violations weren\u2019t intentional.\n\nThe state utilities commission found in 2008 that PG&E had engaged in improper back-channel communications with regulators. In lieu of penalties, it let the utility create a program to prevent future violations.\n\nThe commission later learned that improper communications had resumed a short time afterward. In 2018, it fined the utility $97.5 million for violations of fair-contact rules from 2010 to 2014, including trying to influence judge selection.\n\nPG&E said three executives left after the latter set of infractions came to light, and it created a new post of chief ethics and compliance officer.\n\nUnkept Promises 1996: PG&E paid a $480,000 penalty for breaking a commitment to fix problems with its call-center system.\n\nPG&E paid a $480,000 penalty for breaking a commitment to fix problems with its call-center system. 2006: A $6.5 million penalty for a substation fire that revealed it hadn't fixed problems exposed in a fire 10 years earlier. See all: PG&E Penalties and Settlements Through the Years\n\nPG&E\u2019s program for marking spots where contractors plan to dig might never have been investigated but for the way the company dealt with employees who raised alarms.\n\nIn a nationwide system, contractors planning to dig in streets or yards must first call 811 to make sure they won\u2019t hit a pipeline or electrical cable. Local utilities then have two working days to mark any such locations with spray paint or flags.\n\nAt PG&E, this task fell to employees called locators. About 200 of them plus seasonal workers had to process up to 900,000 \u201cLocate and Mark\u201d work orders a year, a job with high stress and turnover, a former PG&E superintendent named Katherin Mack told state utility investigators, according to a transcript of her sworn interview with the California Public Utilities Commission\u2019s Safety and Enforcement Division.\n\nLocators discovered they could freeze the clock, preventing a work order from registering as late, by methods such as saying they had negotiated a later excavation date, according to several employees as well as consultants PG&E hired to investigate problems with the program.\n\nPG&E\u2019s quality-assurance team looked at the program in 2009 and told higher-ups the next year that \u201cincorrect data is being used to report on-time results,\u201d said a report by the Safety and Enforcement Division. In 2011, PG&E\u2019s Internal Audit team similarly warned company executives that on-time results \u201ccannot be relied upon.\u201d\n\nPG&E was fined $14 million in 1997 for withholding data on harm to sea life from the cooling system of the Diablo Canyon nuclear facility, above. Photo: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images\n\nAround 2013, the Locate and Mark unit came under the oversight of Joel Dickson, director of PG&E\u2019s Gas Operations and Compliance Programs, a local celebrity as a former defensive captain for the University of California, Berkeley football team. Ms. Mack said Mr. Dickson soon announced there were to be \u201czero late tickets.\u201d She said he grew angry at supervisors when locators missed deadlines, resulting in late tickets, sometimes asking her, \u201cDo I need to fire them?\u201d\n\nThe number of late tickets plunged to 44 in 2016 from 13,547 in 2013. Despite the internal audit saying on-time results couldn\u2019t be relied on, PG&E provided them to the state regulator when it began asking questions in 2017. Consultants to PG&E later came up with far higher numbers.\n\nMs. Mack told regulators she and several supervisors informed PG&E\u2019s senior director of gas operations, John Higgins, that locators were entering false data because they were overworked and feared for their jobs.\n\nMr. Higgins, she said, replied that he hadn\u2019t directed anybody to cut corners.\n\nMs. Mack lost her position as a superintendent in the Locate and Mark program in early 2017, which she told investigators she thought was because of her complaints. She later found a job in the company\u2019s electricity division, swallowing a demotion and pay cut.\n\nAround the same time, PG&E promoted Mr. Higgins to vice president of safety and health. He has since left PG&E and didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.\n\nThe company promoted Mr. Dickson to senior director of transportation services in early 2017. He also has since left PG&E and declined interview requests.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Dickson said his client \u201cnever pressured PG&E employees to falsify documents. What he did was encourage PG&E employees to comply with California law\u201d requiring prompt execution of work orders.\n\nA PG&E substation near San Jose was attacked by snipers in 2013. Photo: Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal\n\nA senior manager in quality management named Jennifer Burrows also said she told superiors about problems with locators violating procedures, according to a transcript of her interview with investigators. After that, Ms. Burrows told investigators, she was excluded from meetings at which she formerly presented her findings. In early 2017, PG&E eliminated her position and she took a lateral assignment in the electricity division.\n\nDavid Appelbaum was a manager PG&E recruited in 2013 from the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. He formed a unit at PG&E to investigate causes of \u201cdig-in\u201d accidents in which excavators strike buried pipelines or electrical cables.\n\nHe was disturbed by some PG&E practices, such as going after contractors to pay for dig-in damage when the company bore some responsibility because it hadn\u2019t marked a site on time or had made mistakes, according to a transcript of what he told investigators. He said he complained to Mr. Higgins and others.\n\nAfter he complained, his unit was put under Mr. Dickson\u2019s oversight, Mr. Appelbaum said. From then on, he said, the team was pressured to go easy on PG&E and he was reprimanded for sharing information with regulators.\n\nPG&E fired Mr. Appelbaum in September 2015, saying he had violated its code of conduct. Mr. Appelbaum denied that and filed suit, invoking California law\u2019s whistleblower protections and alleging wrongful discharge, which PG&E denied. Court records show the suit was settled in 2018 with a PG&E payment to Mr. Appelbaum.\n\nMr. Appelbaum returned to the federal pipeline-safety agency, where his boss asked him about his stint at PG&E and he wrote a memo about it, according to the California utilities commission. This memo formed the basis of an investigative referral to the commission.\n\nAfter the Butte Fire at Sheep Ranch, Calif., in September 2015, PG&E was penalized $8.3 million for violations related to it, including failing to timely notify officials of suspicions that some of the utility\u2019s equipment sparked the fire. Photo: Andrew Seng/Sacramento Bee/Zuma Press\n\nAfter months of interviews by its safety and enforcement arm, the commission opened a formal investigation at the end of last year. In March, PG&E filed an 832-page response. Among other things, it disputed assertions by state investigators and its own consultants that it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d the Locate and Mark system was being abused.\n\nPG&E acknowledged the program was understaffed and said it was hiring more people. It denied that upper management understood the depth of the problem and said that workers\u2019 fudging on-time results, in fact, had the effect of hiding the program\u2019s problems. Once \u201cthe issues came to the attention of PG&E leadership in March 2017,\u201d it said, the company took \u201caggressive and quick actions.\u201d\n\nIt also said it thought software fixes in 2012 had solved the problem, but now is designing its own work-management software.\n\nPG&E said there were 67 dig-in accidents involving gas facilities from 2012 to February 2017 where late tickets \u201cmay have been a contributing factor,\u201d although it said it still doesn\u2019t know for sure how many tickets were doctored.\n\nThe utility declined to comment on the three midlevel managers who said they raised alarms about the program. It said it doesn\u2019t comment on personnel matters.\n\nPG&E said it encourages employees to speak up if they perceive a safety issue or some form of misconduct. It added, \u201cFostering this culture takes continual effort.\u201d", "description": "Over more than two decades, the California utility responsible for causing deadly wildfires has at times misled regulators, withheld data and hindered investigations, accumulating fines and judgments of $2.6 billion.
