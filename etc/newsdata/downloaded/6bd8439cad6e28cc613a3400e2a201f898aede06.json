We are unable to provide additional information because of student privacy laws.\u201d\n\nThe departure of the Giannulli sisters comes after Ms. Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli were indicted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Massachusetts as two of 50 parents and officials accused of faking athletic skills and SAT scores to get their children into high-profile universities.\n\nMs. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli are accused of shelling out $500,000 for their two daughters to be admitted to USC as members of the crew team, though neither participated in the sport.\n\nWhile the two are fighting the charges, many others involved in the case have struck plea deals, including actress Felicity Huffman, who began serving a 14-day prison sentence on Oct. 15.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
