He is almost certain to face questions about any direction he has taken from the White House.\n\n[Who is Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky?]\n\nMaguire has also turned to the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel for guidance on the matter, according to a senior administration official who said, \u201cThose consultations are ongoing. At no time has Pat Cipollone personally directed the DNI to withhold information from Congress.\u201d\n\nEven so, the administration has essentially rebuffed the legislative branch, arguing that the whistleblower complaint does not fall under the intelligence director\u2019s jurisdiction, because it pertains to communications by someone outside the intelligence community.\n\nIt is now clear those communications center on Trump, who again on Friday denied that he had engaged in any inappropriate discussions with any world leader but refused to say whether he brought up the Biden investigation on the call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u201d Trump said in an exchange with reporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, has persistently prodded Ukrainian officials in recent months to more aggressively pursue an investigation involving Biden that Ukrainian officials had abandoned and have described as baseless.
