Some firms feel they are less likely to be retaliated against by the giants if they are compelled to share information, according to the source.\n\nOracle has also met with the Justice Department, Glueck said. Google declined comment on the matter.\n\nOracle has alleged that Google infringed on Oracle\u2019s Java copyright to make the Android operating system that runs most of the world\u2019s smartphones. The Supreme Court is considering whether to take up Google\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling reviving the lawsuit. Oracle has sought about $9 billion in damages.\n\nTechnology companies, once lauded as a source of innovation that spurred efficiency and economic growth, face a backlash in the United States and the world over concerns among competitors, lawmakers and consumer groups that the firms have too much power and harm users and business rivals.\n\nTheir critics range from Republicans such as President Donald Trump, who has worried about conservative voices being stifled online, to progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed forcing Google, Facebook and Amazon to sell companies that they purchased because of antitrust concerns.\n\nReuters and other media reported in June that the federal agencies divided up the companies for investigation, with the Justice Department taking Google and Apple while the Federal Trade Commission looked at Facebook and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is also looking at all four while groups of state attorneys general have formed to focus on Facebook and Google.", "description": "Oracle Corp , which has clashed with Alphabet's Google in business disputes, has received requests for information from congressional and state investigators looking into allegations that Google violated antitrust law.", "authors": ["Diane Bartz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433952039&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P00J-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
