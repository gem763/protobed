REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nYum Brands (YUM) third-quarter revenue was in line with analysts\u2019 expectation but profit came in lighter than anticipated amid weak sales at its Pizza Hut brand, which whipsawed its stock in pre-market trading.\n\nHere were the numbers for Yum Brands\u2019 third quarter, compared to Bloomberg-compiled estimates:\n\nRevenue: $1.34 billion vs. $1.34 billion expected\n\nAdj. earnings per share: 80 cents vs. 94 cents expected\n\nWorldwide same-store sales: +3% vs. +3.3% expected\n\nKFC same-store sales: +3% vs. +3.9% expected\n\nTaco Bell same-store sales: +4% vs. +3.5% expected\n\nPizza Hut same-store sales: 0% vs. +1.6% expected\n\nYum\u2019s shares, which ended Tuesday\u2019s trading at $109.72 per share, shed as much as 6% in the wake of the news before clawing back some of those losses.\n\n\u201cFollowing a very strong first half of 2019 and in line with our expectations, third-quarter results were consistent with out long-term growth plan,\u201d CEO Greg Creed said in a statement, who is set to retire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rapidly approaching the end of a truly history year. 2019 will not only mark the completion of out 3-year transformation of Yum!, but will also market the end of my tenure as Yum! CEO,\u201d he added.\n\nIn August, Yum Brands announced that long-time CEO Greg Creed will be succeeded by another Yum Brands veteran David Gibbs starting in January.\n\nYum also noted that it recorded a $60 million pre-tax investment expense related to the change in fair value of its investment in Grubhub (GRUB), which slashed 15 cents off earnings per share. Tuesday, Grubhub shares sank 43% and had their worst day ever after the company issued weak fourth-quarter guidance due to rising competition in the delivery space.\n\nThe third quarter was an eventful one for fast-food restaurants. A slew of collaborations and widespread menu innovation brought excitement to an industry that has been fighting to stay relevant among consumers over recent years.\n\nFor the brands under the Yum umbrella, KFC partnered with plant-based protein maker Beyond Meat (BYND) to test meatless chicken called the Beyond Fried Chicken in one location in the Atlanta area. KFC sold out of the item in just 5 hours.\n\nAnd after axing nine menu items to make room for new products, Taco Bell launched a new limited-time menu item, the Toasted Cheddar Chalupa during the last quarter. Meanwhile, Pizza Hut and Kellogg\u2019s (K) collaborated on the Cheez-It Stuffed Pizza.\n\nIn addition, though it was announced in the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut and Kellogg\u2019s partnered to test a plant-based pizza topping at a Phoenix location for a limited time starting Wednesday, October 23. The Garden Specialty Pizza featured Kellogg\u2019s Incogmeato plant-based Italian sausages, onions, mushrooms and banana peppers.\n\nYum Brands third quarter follows rival Restaurant Brands third-quarter results released Monday. The fast food giant\u2019s two major players, Burger King and Popeyes, reported same-store sales that blew past Wall Street estimates in the wake of a blowout response to the latter\u2019s new chicken sandwich.\n\nThe offering went viral online, and sparked the summer\u2019s chicken sandwich wars \u2014 selling out just two weeks after launch and giving Popeye\u2019s one of its best quarters in nearly 20 years, CEO Jose Cil said. Popeyes will be bringing back the infamous chicken sandwich November 3.\n\nYum Brands shares rose more than 20% this year but have underperformed the broader market. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 23% in the same time period.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings conference call will kick off at 8:15 a.m. ET.\n\nThis post is developing.
