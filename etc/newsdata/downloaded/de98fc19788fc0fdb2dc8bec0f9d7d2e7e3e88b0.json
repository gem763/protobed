He said the Democratic Party ought to focus on the 2020 ballot and would gain more ground if they instead put up a united front on electing Trump out of office.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., launched a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump Tuesday evening. She specifically charged that the administration had violated the law by not turning over a whistleblower complaint concerning Trump's July telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe White House released a transcript of the call Wednesday that showed Trump did seek an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s family dealings in the country. The transcript did not demonstrate that Trump leveraged military aid to Ukraine to obtain a \"promise\" on the probe, as a widely cited report in The Washington Post had claimed. The full transcript has yet to be released.\n\n\u201cAlthough he\u2019s certainly deserving of being impeached, I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s going to happen as a result of this,\u201d Eric Swope, a Democratic voter from Harrisville, N.H., told the Boston Herald. \u201cMy fears are that his base will get all riled up. I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll get all fired up.\u201d\n\nA Democratic strategist told Politico that impeachment hearings against former President Bill Clinton only bolstered his approval rating, quoting The Wire\u2019s Omar Little in saying \u201c\u2018If you come at the king, you best not miss.'\u201d The strategist said if the outcome of the inquiry is anything less than overwhelming against Trump it will only create a \u201cMueller redux.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNew Hampshire political science professor Dante Scala told the Boston Herald he anticipates the outcome of the Granite State poll to show similar numbers. He said if the House fails to impeach the president, the poll may show a \u201cmild boost\u201d in New Hampshire in favor of Trump.\n\n\u201cThe key groups to keep an eye on are the more centrist independents who may have voted for Trump in 2016,\u201d Scala told the Herald. \u201cThe worst-case scenario for Trump would be if those votes take a hit.\u201d The New Hampshire Democratic primary is scheduled to take place on February 11, 2020.", "description": "New Hampshire Democrats said Wednesday that blowback from the House-led impeachment inquiry will only hurt their party\u2019s presidential candidates and will mobilize President Trump\u2019s base, allowing him to more easily win re-election in 2020.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/schumer_pelosi_reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
