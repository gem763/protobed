Still, even she would be impressed with the giant tapestry now on show in France that recounts the plot of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d in glorious and, of course, gory and salacious detail.\n\nWith the award-winning saga about power struggles in mythical Westeros poised for more success at the Emmy Awards on Sunday, the tapestry\u2019s unveiling this month in the Normandy town of Bayeux could hardly be better-timed. The show\u2019s 32 nominations broke a single-year record.\n\nFans who have flocked in their thousands to see the embroidered artwork are giving it a thumbs-up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. You can see kind of the story, how it all lays out,\u201d Amanda Zides, visiting from a suburb of Boston, said as she pored over the tapestry this week. \u201cThey did a nice job - great color, great detail.\u201d\n\nAt 87 meters (285 feet), the tapestry is longer than the width of a soccer pitch and longer than the famous 11th-century Bayeux Tapestry that recounts the Norman invasion of England in 1066. That tapestry served as an inspiration for the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d lookalike.\n\nThe work was commissioned by the tourism office of Northern Ireland, where HBO filmed many of the scenes. Irish officials hope the Bayeux exhibit will boost tourism to Northern Ireland. Its \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d sites are already a big draw, attracting 350,000 visitors in 2018 alone.\n\n\u201cWe consider the Bayeux Tapestry as the grandmother of our \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 tapestry,\u201d said S\u00e9verine Lecart, director of marketing in France for Tourism Ireland.\n\nObvious parallels between the two tapestries include the embroidery styles, colors and structures. Both are divided into three segments, with their central storylines running through the middle bordered by smaller panels displaying motifs like winged beasts or weaponry. The two works evoke similar themes of violent conquest and feudal loyalties.\n\nThe Bayeux Tapestry is thought to have been commissioned by William the Conqueror\u2019s brother. It tells the story of William\u2019s conquest of England with vivid scenes of battle and palace intrigue. It attracts nearly 400,000 visitors annually and Bayeux officials hope the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d exhibit will grow that number.\n\nThe tapestry begins with fictional King Robert Baratheon visiting the Stark family in Winterfell and ends with the final scenes from the eighth and last season. It took a 30-strong team of volunteer embroiderers in Northern Ireland nearly four months to stitch the tapestry in 2017, adding final scenes after \u201cGames of Thrones\u201d finished airing in May.\n\nLike the often-racy show, the tapestry includes several sex scenes. But among visitors on Wednesday, scenes depicting Daenerys Targaryen with her dragons and Jaime Lannister getting his hand chopped off proved particularly popular.\n\n\u201cAmazingly well-presented,\u201d said Geoffrey Vasse, visiting from the Normandy city of Caen. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of the series of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and if there is a tapestry just nearby, I wanted to come and see it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Famously, Arya Stark always preferred her sword Needle to needlework.
