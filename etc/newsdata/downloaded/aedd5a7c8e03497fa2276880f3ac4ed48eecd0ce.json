This quiz uses 10 words from previous bees to test your spelling acumen.\n\nListen to 2006 winner Kerry Close (now a reporter at our sister site Money) pronounce each word, then take a stab at spelling the word yourself. We\u2019ll award partial points if you get close. Try all 10 words to see how you score.\n\nThink those were tough? We could have given you \u201ccytopoiesis\u201d (the production of cells) or \u201czygoneure\u201d (a connecting neuron). Those are both words that last year\u2019s co-champions, Vanya Shivashankar and Gokul Venkatachalam, spelled correctly\u2014and not even in the final rounds.\n\nSources: All words appeared in the 2015 National Spelling Bee.
