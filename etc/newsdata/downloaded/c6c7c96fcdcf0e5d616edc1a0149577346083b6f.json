Nearly half of those polled in the Cigna survey reported sometimes or always feeling alone and only 53% said they had meaningful, in-person social interactions on a daily basis. But the feelings of isolation are most acute among adults ages 18 to 22. Members of generation Z were significantly more likely than any other age group to say they felt isolated.\n\nResearch has long documented high rates of loneliness among seniors too. One in three adults over the age of 45 are lonely, an AARP Foundation survey found.\n\nOne Silicon Valley startup is betting on an unlikely combination \u2013 college students, seniors and technology \u2013 to combat these trends. Using an app, Mon Ami pairs California\u2019s Bay Area students with elderly people to support their emotional wellbeing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marck Rakotoson, left, visits with Pat Hubbard at the BridgePoint senior living facility in Los Altos, California. Photograph: Jim McAuley/The Guardian\n\nJoy Zhang, who had a background in healthcare, and Madeline Dangerfield-Cha, who had worked in education and digital marketing, started Mon Ami while at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. In more than 150 interviews, family members caring for ageing parents repeatedly said they felt intense guilt for not being able to meet their parents\u2019 emotional needs. Zhang and Dangerfield-Cha saw an opportunity to tap college students \u2013 often yearning for connection themselves during a transitional life \u2013 to fill this gap in care for the older generation.\n\nToday, more than 500 Bay Area college students have become \u201cconnective tissue\u201d for more than 250 seniors through Mon Ami, Dangerfield-Cha said.\n\nThe relationships are facilitated by the app, through which students can search for seniors in need in their area (not unlike gig work), schedule visits and message with the seniors\u2019 family members. They log a report every visit, complete with a selfie. The report triggers a PayPal payment for the students, who receive $20 per hour of the $25 hourly rate families pay.\n\nThe Guardian spoke with three pairs of Mon Ami students and seniors to ask how these meetings are making life less lonely for both groups in the 21st century.\n\n\u2018Instead of just existing, you\u2019re living\u2019\n\nTed Bunding, 76, and Tanya Tannous, 21\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bunding and Tannous often build and fly paper airplanes during their time together. Photograph: Jim McAuley/Jim McAuley for The Guardian\n\nTed Bunding needs help getting in and out of his wheelchair. He struggles to speak clearly and recall questions he\u2019s been asked, and he sometimes thinks he\u2019s grasped hold of something, like a fork full of food, when he hasn\u2019t.\n\nBunding, 76, has lived with Parkinson\u2019s disease for two decades.\n\nHe\u2019s also an engineering buff whose eyes light up when Tanya Tannous, a University of California, Berkeley, student and Mon Ami \u201ccompanion\u201d, visits him once a week to fly paper airplanes together.\n\nTannous and Bunding assumed their pre-takeoff positions in the outdoor courtyard of an Oakland senior living facility, Bunding\u2019s hovering hand in the air, ready to thrust his paper airplane into the slight summer breeze.\n\n\u201cThe wind is in our favor today,\u201d Tannous said. He nodded, slightly, his movements slowed by the Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nI felt trapped by loneliness but found a way to make connections Read more\n\nThe two are separated by five decades but have bonded over a mutual admiration for \u201chow things work\u201d, as Bunding put it.\n\nBunding is a former car mechanic who repaired computers at the Stanford campus bookstore for years and listens religiously to NPR\u2019s Car Talk. Tannous, now a senior majoring in molecular biology, was obsessed with cars as a young girl. When they\u2019re not testing out flight variables for paper airplanes, they\u2019re deep in the pages of Engineering the Pyramids and JRR Tolkien books.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re together, he wakes up,\u201d said Liz Erlich, Bunding\u2019s younger sister and primary caretaker. \u201cThey can communicate. Because Ted has difficulty talking, a lot of people don\u2019t understand him and they turn away. But if you spend a little bit of time and a little bit of effort, you begin to hear him.\u201d\n\nBunding was one of Mon Ami\u2019s earliest clients. Stanford students visited him and his partner at their Menlo Park home. But as his Parkinson\u2019s and his partner\u2019s dementia advanced, their families decided they both would need more intensive care and moved them into separate facilities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bunding holds a paper airplane he built with Tannous. Photograph: Jim McAuley/The Guardian\n\nWhile Erlich\u2019s daily visits are mostly focused on her brother\u2019s medical care or chores, Tannous is there solely to spend time with him. After they spend time together, his mood is lighter and he\u2019s more engaged, his sister said.\n\nThe students are not meant to provide professional care, but rather companionship. The Mon Ami founders drew on research that has shown the health benefits of social interaction for seniors, from combating cognitive decline to reducing the use of pharmacological interventions in people with dementia. (On the flip side, loneliness has been linked to cardiovascular disease, dementia, obesity, depression and anxiety.)\n\n\u201cTo have this aspect of taking care of someone \u2013 to think about somebody\u2019s emotional and mental life \u2013 I\u2019m very glad they came up with this idea,\u201d Erlich said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be one or the other. It\u2019s both.\u201d\n\nThis emotional uplifting is even more critical for seniors in assisted living centers, Erlich said, where \u201cwhat\u2019s easiest\u201d is often \u201cto get somebody dressed, put them in a wheelchair and stick them in the corner.\n\nWith the kind of engagement Tannous provides, \u201cinstead of just existing, you\u2019re living\u201d, Erlich said.\n\nTannous, whose grandfather also has Parkinson\u2019s, joined Mon Ami last year after her roommate worked as a companion. She\u2019s become a consistent part of Bunding\u2019s life. She can intuit what he\u2019s saying even when his speech is difficult to understand \u2013 including jokes that someone who hadn\u2019t invested that time or overlooked him because of his condition might miss entirely.\n\nA scientist at heart, like Bunding, she quotes Isaac Newton to explain what she enjoys most about the experience: \u201cIf I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs young people I think we forget sometimes that there are people that have preceded us and make us who we are,\u201d Tannous said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to connect with generations above us and below us.\u201d\n\n\u2018We talk about tech companies ruining San Francisco\u2019\n\nSandra Church, 82, and Jacob Choi, 29\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jacob Choi helps Sandra Church prepare and organize for her annual trip to Europe. Photograph: Jim McAuley/The Guardian\n\nYoung techies and older San Franciscans are often at odds with one another. But in a fifth-floor apartment in Russian Hill on a recent afternoon, two found common ground.\n\nJacob Choi, a 29-year-old educational technology startup founder, was helping Sandra Church, an 82-year-old former Broadway actor born in San Francisco, draft itineraries and send emails for her coming two-and-a-half month trip to Europe. Choi, a Mon Ami companion, comes over once or twice a month for six hours, usually on a Sunday, to help Church with odd jobs around her home.\n\nWhile she describes herself as a young octogenarian \u2013 mobile and independent but living alone in the elegant, art-filled apartment \u2013 Choi\u2019s visits are a \u201cgodsend\u201d.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t do all this stuff any more by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it gets [to the point that] I can\u2019t handle it, I\u2019m just a nervous wreck.\u201d\n\nChoi, who graduated from the Stanford School of Business last year, does a little bit of everything for Church. He\u2019s created a filing system to organize decades of her handwritten journals, set up her Sonos sound system, reprogrammed an all-in-one remote, fixed stuck doorknobs and hung her canvas paintings in a back hallway.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Choi and Church at Church\u2019s home in San Francisco. Photograph: Jim McAuley/The Guardian\n\nChurch \u2013 warm and energetic with a dry sense of humor, peppered with profanities \u2013 insists she wasn\u2019t seeking companionship through Mon Ami. \u201cI\u2019m a loner,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the two have an almost familial rapport. They talk politics, art, history and films. A frequent topic is the role tech has played in changing San Francisco. (Church has been both fascinated and horrified to learn about automation and job displacement from Choi.)\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we talk about a lot is how the infiltration of tech companies is ruining the culture of San Francisco, especially for people who have been here for a really long time,\u201d Choi said. He sees Mon Ami as a \u201cgood opportunity to use technology \u2013 it\u2019s an app [and] it\u2019s kind of gig work as well \u2013 to give back.\u201d\n\nChoi visits regularly with one other Mon Ami senior, a Japanese American woman with severe Alzheimer\u2019s. They often visit the de Young Museum and go on walks in Golden Gate Park.\n\nThe time he spends with these women \u2013 off his phone and in conversation with people from another generation \u2013 is precious to him as well.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of my escape from my normal job, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cSandra\u2019s not on her iPhone checking her Instagram, you know?\u201d\n\n\u2018Because I\u2019m not from here, they\u2019re helping me\u2019\n\nCarlos Watson, 85, and Marck Rakotoson, 21\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marck Rakotoson, right, visits with Carlos Watson. Photograph: Jim McAuley/The Guardian\n\nAt one Silicon Valley senior living facility, Mon Ami students pull hard-to-reach residents back into life.\n\nEarlier this year, staff at the BridgePoint at Los Altos partnered with the company to work with seniors who tend to stay in their rooms and aren\u2019t receptive to the staff\u2019s efforts to engage them.\n\nOne such resident is Carlos Watson. The 85-year-old native of Jamaica, Vietnam veteran and former professor is endlessly talkative but spends a lot of time in his room.\n\nBut on a recent weekend morning, he talked animatedly with Marck Rakotoson, a De Anza College student from Madagascar. Both are passionate about civil rights, Watson as a participant in the 1960s civil rights movement and Rakotoson as a 21-year-old transplant to the US.\n\nWatson recalled vividly the day that Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. He was in the middle of a lecture on racism at the University of Pittsburgh when his wife called with the news.\n\n\u201cI brought the class to a closure. There was no way I was capable of going on,\u201d Watson recounted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watson describes living at the BridgePoint senior living facility as a \u2018good challenge\u2019. Photograph: Jim McAuley/The Guardian\n\nAn activist at heart, he convinced an initially reluctant university president to cancel classes for the day, hold a memorial service in King\u2019s honor and create a scholarship for needy students who wanted to study non-violence.\n\n\u201cI told him that there is no way students, faculty, or workers could perform their duty with the unfortunate slaying of the apostle of non-violence,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWhat you could do for us is to close the university so the unfulfilled dreams of Dr King nationwide could be better fulfilled, to meditate on what he did not live to bring to fruition.\u201d\n\nWatson has lived at the BridgePoint for three years, which he describes as a \u201cgood challenge\u201d. He was visibly enlivened by talking with a young person as interested in history and political activism as he is.\n\nRakotoson, curious and soft spoken, didn\u2019t listen passively to Watson\u2019s steady flow of historical anecdotes. He jumps in with questions and comments as their conversation progressed from civil rights in the 1960s to Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey\u2019s \u201cback to Africa\u201d movement to the achievements of the soccer greats Lionel Messi and Pel\u00e9. Rakotoson remembered details from their last visit, asking about Watson\u2019s children\u2019s work and the family\u2019s travel plans.\n\n\u201cI love talking to seniors,\u201d Rakotoson said. \u201cI think they have a lot of wisdom to share. Because I\u2019m not from here ... they\u2019re helping me to see how is life, to give me advice.\u201d", "description": "Can an app bring together two of the most isolated age groups \u2013 students and seniors? \u2018It\u2019s important to connect with generations above and below,\u2019 users say", "authors": ["Elena Kadvany"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d159cf731f446703c95749a12278f93e5134fad/0_293_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39871a7b8fe73ea076933a077068b337", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
