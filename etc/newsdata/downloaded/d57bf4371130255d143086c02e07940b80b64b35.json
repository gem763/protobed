One man was shot in the eye as he sat on the living room couch. Another victim, a woman, was slumped over in a nearby recliner. And two more people, a man and a woman also shot, were bleeding in a bedroom.\n\nMore than three years after the four friends, who had been settling in for what was supposed to be a quiet Friday night, were attacked, the man who authorities say fired a gun at them over and over again was convicted of multiple counts of murder.\n\nA Prince George\u2019s County jury on Friday found Lawrence Sylvester Rogers Jr., 27, guilty of 17 counts in all, including attempted murder, assault and weapons charges in addition to murder.\n\nThough the conviction brings some measure of closure in the case, the motive behind the slayings remained a mystery despite hours of evidence and testimony prosecutors presented over five days of trial. The trial also left unanswered what, if any, prior connection Rogers had to any of the victims.\n\n\n\nThe trial centered on the shooting that occurred June 24, 2016, in a home on Orleans Avenue in District Heights.\n\n[Three victims fatally shot in Prince George\u2019s County]\n\nOne of the residents, Jonathan Givons, had left to walk his pit bull that evening, he testified. When he returned about 15 to 20 minutes later, he said, the front door snapped shut as he tried to get into the house. As he went around to a side door, he heard his girlfriend inside screaming, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d\n\nGivons testified that he heard several shots fired inside the home before a man ran out the front door, slid around the lawn and then fired at him.\n\n\u201cI tried to run toward the back of the house,\u201d Givons testified about encountering the gunman after the first bullet grazed his arm. \u201cWhen I tried to get away, that\u2019s when he shot me again.\u201d\n\nWith his dog Cinnamon\u2019s leash still linked to his arm, Givons said, he fell to the ground as the gunman fled.\n\nThe four people inside the home were fatally wounded. Carlina Renee Gray, 50; Jan Marie Parks, 55; and Allen Rowlett, 60, died immediately after the shooting.\n\nHarold Williams, 65, who was rendered quadriplegic, lingered for months in medical facilities before he died.\n\nAll had either lived in the home or were visiting as friends the night of the shooting.\n\nAs the only surviving victim, Givons did not directly point out Rogers as the gunman, but he told jurors that a man in long dreadlocks, a white T-shirt and jeans had shot him.\n\nPolice had collected surveillance video from shops and homes in the area that showed a man matching the description Givons had provided. Authorities later identified the man as Rogers. They also found witnesses who interacted with Rogers that night, including one man who testified he had been randomly approached by Rogers at a nearby gas station asking for a ride. The man agreed to drive Rogers to a motel in exchange for cash, and he testified that Rogers\u2019s body language changed, slumping as if to hide his head, as they passed the police lights surrounding the shooting scene.\n\nRogers later asked to use the man\u2019s identification to check into the hotel and the man refused, he testified. Rogers then checked in with his own identity, prosecutors said.\n\nDays later, police tracked Rogers to a home in Southeast Washington. When police first entered the apartment with a search warrant, a man and woman inside said they were the only ones there, according to court testimony. But as police swept through the property, they found a closet door blocked with plastic clothes bins. Police found Rogers inside with his hands in the air, a District officer testified.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only person in the apartment who hides ... because he knows why the police are there,\u201d Prince George\u2019s County Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Sherrie Waldrup said during closing arguments.\n\nIn another closet in the apartment, Waldrup said, police found a gun that forensic experts testified was the weapon used in the Orleans Avenue killings.\n\nAssistant Public Defender Richard Rydelek insisted the prosecution\u2019s case was shaky. Rydelek questioned the quality of the black-and-white surveillance video showing a man running from the murder scene and said it didn\u2019t definitively identify his client.\n\nRydelek also said no evidence was presented to show a connection between his client and the people killed. There were no fingerprints on the door. Money, jewelry and drugs remained in the house after the shooting, Rydelek said, so it wasn\u2019t a robbery. And, he said, prosecutors never said Rogers knew the victims.\n\n\u201cThe simple truth is there has been no evidence of any kind to establish a motive for these killings,\u201d Rydelek said. \u201cWith lack of motive, it makes it that much more difficult to understand this.\u201d\n\nBut, Waldrup suggested, if Rogers were not guilty, why do jailhouse phone calls and letters show him urging his mother to lie on his behalf? In a letter to a girlfriend, Rogers wrote he was \u201cfaking mental illness\u201d to \u201ctake the crazy route\u201d at trial, Waldrup said.\n\nIn one letter to his mother, Rogers said a psychologist would be contacting her and that she should say he had a \u201csplit personality\u201d and describe \u201chow I used to talk to myself and ate paint\u201d as a child, Waldrup said.\n\n\u201c\u2018Let them know I wasn\u2019t regular,\u2019 \u201d Waldrup said Rogers pleaded with his mother, urging her to lie so he could come home.\n\nAfter the jury read the verdict, Rogers turned to his family and a woman gave him words of assurance.\n\n\u201cJust stay strong, okay?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the last word.\u201d\n\nFamily of the victims left pleased with the verdict.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to see that justice is prevailing,\u201d said Gloria Eskridge, Williams\u2019s sister. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, agonizing three years.\u201d\n\nGivons said it has been difficult moving on from that night. He goes to therapy regularly to tend to both his mental and physical wounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like trying to start my whole life again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been rough.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you think the defendant is handsome?\u2019: Rape case takes unusual turn when accused represents himself at trial\n\nInnocent man spent months in jail for bringing honey back to United States\n\nProsecutors in Prince George\u2019s will no longer recommend cash bail for defendants\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Four people were mortally wounded a shooting in a home in District Heights, Md., in 2016.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IgoCOOj7iQFQ0ZmhcSovmCIwodI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQ7QY6FHAEI6RLLPBADXBXG5YI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
