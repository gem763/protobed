I didn\u2019t want it to end like this, I wouldn\u2019t mind properly ending it, even if we went out next week or the week before, but I didn\u2019t want to end it like this.\n\n\u2018To do the salsa and getting you up in those lifts, I never thought I could do half of the stuff \u2013 but I was scared of dancing and [Janette] believed in me.\u2019\n\nChoosing his highlights of the show, Will went on: \u2018The last one we did was so special it was amazing, I understood the dance, it meant so much to me, it was so special.\n\n\u2018Going back to Great Ormond Street \u2013 it was just so special that dance.\u2019\n\nJanette also showered him with support: \u2018I think as I said on the week, we ended this, it\u2019s not how we wanted to end it, but in my eyes, we ended it on a high. That dance is the reason why I dance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We dance to touch people and inspire people and Will is the epitome of that, and that dance shows that.\u2019\n\nThe pro continued: \u2018All I have in my heart right now is so many incredibly awesome moments I shared with Will, not just onscreen, but just me and him chatting about life.\n\n\u2018I genuinely feel I have made a friend for life. I am happy I have met him.\u2019\n\nIt Takes Two continues tomorrow at 6.30pm on BBC 2.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
