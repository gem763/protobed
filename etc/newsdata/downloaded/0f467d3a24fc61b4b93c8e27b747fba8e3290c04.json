This is a vote of conscious, this is a vote of progress.\u201d\n\nThe four new jails to replace the 10,000-bed Rikers complex will have a combined daily capacity of 3,300, requiring the city to reduce the jail population by more than half by the time Rikers is set to close in 2026.\n\nCritics, including City Council Republican leader Steven Matteo, questioned whether this was possible.\n\n\u201cIt will require putting more potentially dangerous offenders back on the street, jeopardizing public safety,\u201d Matteo said.\n\nOfficials said the new jails will also be smaller and more humane, providing detainees with job training, mental health counseling and education services.\n\nThe city also announced $265 million in spending efforts to keep people out of jail and support those who have been released.", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 The New York City Council voted Thursday to approve a plan overhauling the city\u2019s corrections systems by opening four new", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
