It\u2019s a well-known fact that they\u2019re the perfect pair, but did you know that you can very easily make your own peanut butter cups at home with just a handful of ingredients? Your kids can help too! And that's not all \u2014 they\u2019re significantly more nutritious than the store-bought variety. Talk about (a delicious) win!\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to make easy and delicious peanut butter cups at home:\n\ncocoa powder\n\nmelted coconut oil\n\npure maple syrup (or liquid honey if you prefer)\n\nnatural peanut butter\n\nchopped nuts of your choice\n\nsea salt (optional)\n\nsmall silicone cupcake liners\n\nThis is more of a formula than a recipe. It\u2019s not at all fussy and can easily be adapted to be more or less sweet, to make cups with more chocolate and less nut filling and to use different types of nut and seed butters all together. That said, here\u2019s what you need to know: equal parts cocoa powder and coconut oil, plus sweetener to taste for the chocolate coating and equal parts nut butter and chopped nuts with sweetener to taste for the nutty filling. That\u2019s it!\n\nNow that you know the secret formula, here\u2019s how we make ours!\n\nChocolate coating\n\nFirst measure 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and invite your little one to dump it into a large mixing bowl. Add a 1/2 cup of melted coconut oil and a 1/3 of a cup of pure maple syrup and whisk it until it looks like a nice, smooth chocolate sauce. Invite your little one to spoon a little bit of the homemade chocolate coating into each of the mini silicone baking cups. We like our peanut butter cups to be mostly peanut buttery filling with just a little bit of chocolate, so we just add enough to fully cover the bottom plus a swirl up along the sides of the cups. Which brings us to our next step! This might be the trickiest part of the whole recipe, but the worst that can happen is a little bit of spilled chocolate sauce, which if you ask my daughter, is a very happy mistake. Carefully pick up each silicone baking cup, tip it upright and rotate it so that the sides of the cup are covered in chocolate. You may need to do this a couple of times to get a good layer of chocolate, but since perfection is not our goal here, spotty side coverage isn\u2019t a real concern \u2014 they\u2019re sure to be delicious either way! Once you're done, pop the silicone cups into the fridge or freezer to set while you prepare the nutty filling.\n\nNut Filling\n\nAdd 3/4 cup of natural peanut butter, 3/4 of a cup of chopped nuts (we love toasted pecans, but obviously peanuts would be perfect too), 2 tablespoons of honey or pure maple syrup, and a big pinch of sea salt (if desired) to a mixing bowl. Mix it really well until the mixture is thick and the nuts are evenly distributed. With the filling ready to go, take the chocolate-coated baking cups out of the freezer and begin forming little nut butter patties with a measuring spoon or your fingers. Place a patty in each of the baking cups and flatten down the tops using the back of a spoon or your fingers. Cover the nut filling by spooning more of your homemade chocolate sauce directly on top. Now if the sauce has thickened since you began, just add a little heat. We usually do this by placing the bowl of chocolate sauce over a smaller bowl filled with really hot water, but I suspect a quick stint in the microwave would probably work too. Once heated, pop the peanut butter cups back into the fridge or freezer to set once again. If it's firm to the touch, you\u2019re ready for the most satisfying task \u2014 peeling them out of the silicone baking cups!\n\nYou\u2019ll want to keep these in an air-tight container in the fridge or the freezer to maintain their form, but they\u2019ll make the most satisfying treat when you\u2019re craving something sweet!", "description": "Peanut butter cups FTW!
