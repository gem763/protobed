You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis finding was then combined with research on the public which said that \u201cpeople who eat meat enjoy it, they think of it as helpful and they\u2019re reluctant to change their dietary habits\u201d, according to author Dr Bradley Johnson.\n\nHe added the result was that, \u201cgiven that there\u2019s low-quality evidence or low certainty evidence, combined with what we know about values and preferences, we made a weak recommendation that, for some people \u2013 but not everyone \u2013 the right approach is to continue their meat consumption.\u201d\n\nHowever the study has faced significant push-back from the scientific community, with the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition issuing a 2,000-word rebuttal, which said the findings were a misreading of the study\u2019s own data.\n\nThe critique also featured comments from scientists whose research was included arguing the finding was a misrepresentation of their work. One researcher from the US Women\u2019s Health Initiative, which Dr Johnson told The Independent was a \u201cprimary focus for the process of making our recommendations\u201d, said the study was a \u201cmisuse and misinterpretation of data from the WHI\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The highly social birds will also remember that person if they come near their nests again, according to researchers from the University of Exeter. In the study, a person unknown to the wild jackdaws approached their nest. At the same time scientists played a recording of a warning call (threatening) or \u201ccontact calls\u201d (non-threatening). The next time jackdaws saw this same person, the birds that had previously heard the warning call were defensive and returned to their nests more than twice as quickly on average.

They\u2019re actually issuing guidelines at odds with their own study. I\u2019ve never really seen anything like it before in my entire career.\u201d\n\nDescribing the decision to throw support behind eating meat as \u201ctragic\u201d, he added that the study\u2019s own data showed \u201csignificantly and consistently\u201d that there were \u201chigher rates of death, heart disease, cancer and diabetes with higher intakes of red and processed meats\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Well for an individual that\u2019s a small risk. At the level of the US population that\u2019s a variance of 325,000 unnecessary premature deaths per year. There\u2019s nothing small about that.\u201d\n\nThe Harvard rebuttal of the study also criticised authors for failing to consider the environmental impact of meat \u2013 a choice understood to have been made due to the limited resources of the research group.\n\nCiting a report published by the EAT-Lancet commission, Dr Katz said humanity needed to reduce its meat intake by about 90 per cent to stay within sustainable limits. \u201cWe destroy biodiversity, we dry out our aquifiers, we acidify the oceans \u2013 we soil our nest. You can\u2019t ignore that when we\u2019re talking about human health. That is the greatest human health event of all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe World Cancer Research Fund recommends avoiding processed meat altogether due to its carcinogenic properties, while the Department of Health and Social Care recommends anyone who eats more than 90g of processed red or processed meat per day should cut down to 70g \u2013 equivalent to one and a half sausages.", "description": "Scientists have raised concerns over a new study which claims there is little to no evidence that cutting out red meat limits the risk of cancer, heart disease or diabetes.
