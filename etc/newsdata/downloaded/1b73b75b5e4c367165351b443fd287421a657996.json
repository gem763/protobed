Walker can do everything but Gareth has his opinion, he made his selection and he decided for the last two times and Kyle and I respect it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge for Kyle to show how good he is, my opinion doesn\u2019t change if he is in the national team or not \u2014 he remains an incredible footballer.\u201d\n\nWalker will likely be stationed at right-back for Sunday\u2019s Premier League home clash against Wolverhampton Wanderers when City could find themselves eight points adrift of Liverpool by kickoff.\n\nPlaymaker Kevin de Bruyne will miss out though because of a groin injury, Guardiola confirmed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big problem, he will be ready after the international break,\u201d he said.\n\nThe in-form Belgian playmaker suffered the injury in last weekend\u2019s win over Everton and missed Tuesday\u2019s Champions League victory over Dinamo Zagreb.\n\nGuardiola said he was wary of a Wolves side that appears to be rediscovering the form of last season and beat Turkish club Besiktas away in the Europa League on Thursday.\n\n\u201cYesterday they took an incredible result,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI saw the game and they were so solid as expected. At the end, they have a team to make you suffer in the Premier League.\n\n\u201cThey know exactly what they have to do, three or four seasons together and there is a really impressive defensive structure. We have to be smart to take a result.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Kyle Walker remains \u201can incredible player\u201d in the eyes of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola despite the right back once again being left out of the England squad.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
