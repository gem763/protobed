LOUIS \u2013 The Washington Nationals\u2019 first-ever National League Championship Game was bound to be historic.\n\nAnibal Sanchez nearly made it doubly so.\n\nSanchez came within four outs of no-hitting the St. Louis Cardinals, instead settling for 7 \u2154 gutty innings of one-hit ball as Washington captured Game 1 with a 2-0 conquest Friday night at Busch Stadium.\n\nSanchez, 35, nearly became the first pitcher to throw a playoff no-hitter since the late Roy Halladay for Philadelphia in Game 1 of the 2010 NL Division Series against Cincinnati.\n\nHe came perhaps one strike short.\n\nWith two outs in the bottom of the eighth inning, pinch hitter Jose Martinez battled Sanchez for seven pitches, at one point desperately fouling off a 2-2 changeup to stay alive, before dropping a clean single in front of center fielder Michael A. Taylor.\n\nManager Dave Martinez did not hesitate to hook Sanchez, who threw 103 pitches. Sean Doolittle recorded the final four outs, in place of closer Daniel Hudson, who missed Game 1 for the Friday birth of his third child.\n\nNationals starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez is removed after allowing his first hit of the game in the eighth inning.

On that night, however, he walked six Boston Red Sox and exited with the no-hitter intact after throwing 116 pitches. The Red Sox eventually registered a ninth-inning hit in the Tigers\u2019 1-0 victory.\n\nHUDSON: Nats back closer, show baseball isn't life\n\nFALL CLASSIC: Ranking the four potential World Series matchups\n\nSanchez was far more efficient Friday, which was 63 years and three days since Don Larsen\u2019s perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series for the New York Yankees.\n\nWith a sinker, cutter and changeup repertoire that had his fastest pitch topping out at 92 mph, Sanchez needed just 75 pitches to navigate the first six innings, ultimately walking just one and striking out five, though he hit two batters. He needed just one defensive gem \u2013 first baseman Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s laid-out snag of a Tommy Edman liner leading off the eighth \u2013 and otherwise mystified the Cardinals.\n\n.@Nationals RHP An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez is just the 6th starting pitcher ever to throw 7.2 hitless innings in a #postseason game.

In the sixth, pinch-hitter Randy Arozarena was hit with a 1-2 pitch, and he too reached third on a steal and a groundout.\n\nBut once again, Sanchez induced a harmless fly ball, from Wong, to end the threat.\n\nThe rest of the night, it was a pitching clinic in adding and subtracting, spotting up and flummoxing the Cardinals, with a curveball that bottomed out at 66 mph and everything else in between.\n\n\"This guy's an accomplished pitcher in this league and has done a nice job for their club,\" said Cardinals manager Mike Shildt. \"Did a nice job against the Dodgers. That's why before the game when we had our little gathering here people were talking about the big three and I said hey, we're going to respect them, we're familiar with them but we got a guy tonight that we got to contend with, and not overlook him.\n\n\"And we didn't. He was just really good, made a lot of quality pitches and didn't give us a lot we could put good swings on.\"\n\nIn Game 2, the Cardinals will see an entirely different look from the Nationals when three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer takes the mound. But Scherzer, Sanchez\u2019s teammate in Detroit and for this year in Washington, appreciates greatness when he sees it.\n\n\u201cHis ability to change speeds, it's probably one of the best in the game,\u201d Scherzer said Friday. \u201cThe way he can change speeds, even on his changeup, he can change speeds, I mean, he can slow it all the way down, we call it the butterfly, he can throw a butterfly in there and you get guys just every hitter just waves at it.\n\n\u201cSo that's what makes him such a treat to watch.\u201d\n\nSuch a treat that the Nationals playing behind him could practically pull up a chair, themselves. Oh, Marcell Ozuna provided one hard-hit ball - a 105-mph fly to the warning track in the top of the second inning - and shortstop Trea Turner drifted fairly deep into left field to snare a seventh-inning pop-up from Paul Goldschmidt.\n\nOtherwise, it was a litany of routine \u2013 so much soft contact, so many perfunctory plays.\n\nGomes provided the necessary offense with an RBI double in the second inning, and Howie Kendrick relieved significant tension with an RBI single in the seventh. The rest of the night was Sanchez\u2019s.\n\nHe handed a 1-0 NLCS lead to the Nationals, who will now hand the ball to Scherzer \u2013 and Mad Max has one tough act to follow.", "description": "Anibal Sanchez went 7 2/3 innings before allowing his first hit as the Nationals beat the Cardinals 2-0 in Game 1 of the NCLS.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
