Jeremy, what show are you on?\u2019\n\nIn response, Jeremy said: \u2018I\u2019m currently on Millie Inbetween, the number one kids show in the country. I\u2019ve just been around.\u2019\n\nAfter the performance, and some negative feedback from Howie Mandel and Randy Jackson, Simon Cowell added: \u2018Can I say something? I believe the most important thing is who do the public want to see through? The audience who have watched you Brendan in particular.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking at Jeremy, Simon added: \u2018I don\u2019t know you so well, but 16 million people have watched you every week. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u2019\n\nJeremy Edwards was left fuming (Picture: ITV)\n\nSpeaking after the critique among the other contestants, Jeremy was clearly upset by the negative reaction, saying: \u2018They were really mean and that\u2019s upsetting because it\u2019s like okay we\u2019re trying.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re off the TV in England and people know us and they love us.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know that was a bit mean. I don\u2019t like people being mean.\u2019\n\nViewers however weren\u2019t exactly feeling the sympathy.\n\nStick to dancing \ud83d\udd7a\u2026 #XFactorCelebrity\u2026 the other one from the kids show no ones heard of is throwing a hissy fit \u2026 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/srry9PPYj5 \u2014 Tony Gwenin (@TGwenin) October 12, 2019\n\nAnd the Edwards guy actually raging saying they were nasty \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4f mate \ud83d\udc4f get \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc4f grip \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 #XFactorCelebrity pic.twitter.com/yTre0cgD6I \u2014 Yazzy \ud83d\udda4 (@SpazzyYazzy1990) October 12, 2019\n\n#XFactorCelebrity oooh Jeremy Edwards touchy\u2026.what an attitude \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Lisa (@looloo40) October 12, 2019\n\nCringing for brendon and Jeremy #XFactorCelebrity pic.twitter.com/7jwtLhGCCG \u2014 Lisa M M (@LisaMayle) October 12, 2019\n\nOther contestants on the show included a Love Island supergroup, Glee\u2019s Kevin McHale, and Martin Bashir who left everyone in tears.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity is available on ITV Player.\n\nMORE: The Chase\u2019s Jenny Ryan leaves viewers \u2018speechless\u2019 on X Factor: Celebrity with Queen cover\n\nMORE: X Factor: Celebrity viewers in tears over Martin Bashir\u2019s emotional tribute to late brother", "description": "Jeremy Edwards was left fuming after the judges critiques on X Factor: Celebrity.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jeremy-edwards-and-simon-cowell_1570919897.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
