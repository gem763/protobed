The fantasy novel marked the latest departure from basketball for Bryant, who created the story alongside author Annie Matthew.\n\nBryant is now years removed from the NBA career that made him a national figure. His creative pursuits have won awards but generated a mixed reaction from the public, most notably in March 2018, when Bryant\u2019s Academy Award win prompted critics to reference a 2003 sexual assault allegation against him involving a 19-year-old woman, which was later settled out of court.\n\nWhile past deeds have rightfully drawn unprecedented scrutiny in the \u201cMe Too\u201d era, which led to the downfall of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, former CBS Chairman Leslie Moonves and other figures accused of wrongdoing, Bryant\u2019s involvement won\u2019t have a negative effect on sales, according to Stacey Miller, longtime book publicist and founder of SJMiller Communications. In fact, it is likely to boost them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, but Kobe is a legend. He\u2019s a controversial legend and he\u2019s got a lot more issues and venom against him that comes from places other than those particular allegations. \u2026 [but] nobody wants books that don\u2019t have some kind of talking point beyond the content of the book,\u201d Miller told FOX Business. \u201cThe fact that we have a person who\u2019s so polarizing here [in] Kobe, as the author of record of the books is reason to bring him to the table rather than avoid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the book publishing industry has been under some pressure in recent years, children\u2019s and young adult releases have been relatively stable, with publishers earning a total of $4.45 billion in revenue for fiction and non-fiction content in 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers. Overall revenue and unit sales each rose slightly on a year-over-year basis.\n\nBryant\u2019s animated short film, \u201cDear Basketball,\u201d was a critical and commercial success upon its release. However, his win at the 2018 Academy Awards drew a widespread negative reaction on social media. More recently, the American Booksellers Association\u2019s decision to feature Bryant as a speaker at Winter Institute 14 generated criticism among some booksellers at the event, according to Publisher\u2019s Weekly.\n\nBryant was initially arrested on sexual assault charges in 2003, though the case was later dropped after a settlement was reached. He apologized for his actions but said the encounter was consensual.\n\nGranity Studios did not immediately return a request for comment. Bryant\u2019s firm is set to release five \u201cmiddle grade and young adult novels\u201d by the end of 2020.\n\nWhile Bryant\u2019s past deeds may cloud the public perception of his creative pursuits, another element of his work could pose a bigger obstacle to the book\u2019s potential audience. Given his fame as a basketball player, the decision to write a fantasy novel about a tennis player could give some readers pause, according to Miller.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stretch. Part of what you have to have as the author of the book is the credibility to convince people that you\u2019re the guy to write this thing. That said, will kids buy it? Sure,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a book that\u2019s asking any child to take him as a hero or to accept him as a role model. This is, I think, something that says \u2018kids, please read. Please get off the internet. Please pick up a book. I think it can do that, and maybe it\u2019s an opportunity to teach our kids, here\u2019s what we don\u2019t do.\u201d", "description": "The fantasy novel marked the latest departure from basketball for Bryant, who created the story alongside author Annie Matthew.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/63f8b388-4e1f13f936fe4279af19484dcde18fd4.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
