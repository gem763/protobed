USA TODAY\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams weren't done dealing after two trades on Tuesday and saved their biggest deal for last.\n\nCornerback Jalen Ramsey was traded to the team as part of a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars, a person with knowledge of the deal confirmed to USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced.\n\nThe Jaguars will receive first-round picks in 2020 and 2021, as well as a fourth-round pick in 2021.\n\nThe move completes the reshaping of the Rams' secondary after the team traded cornerback Marcus Peters to the Baltimore Ravens on Tuesday. Fellow starting cornerback Aqib Talib was also placed on injured reserve with a rib injury.\n\nThe Rams also acquired offensive lineman Austin Corbett from the Cleveland Browns on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal ends a standoff between Ramsey and the Jaguars that reached a head this season when the two-time Pro Bowl selection requested a trade after a 13-12 loss to the Houston Texans in Week 2. Ramsey and coach Doug Marrone had a heated confrontation on the sideline, and he later said on Uninterrupted's \"17 Weeks\" podcast that he had an upsetting discussion with Jacksonville management in which \"some disrespectful things were said on their end.\"\n\nRamsey has missed the Jaguars' last three games. He returned home in Week 4 for the birth of his second child, and he has also has been recovering from a back injury, though he returned to practice last week. Jaguars owner Shad Khan last week he had a \"heart-to-heart\" with Ramsey and expected the standout defender to return against the New Orleans Saints, but the cornerback was among the team's inactive players.\n\nFor the Rams, the acquisition is the latest in a bold line of trades by general manager Les Snead, who in recent years has also landed outside linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. and wide receiver Brandin Cooks, as well as Peters and Talib. Though the Rams have repeatedly given up draft capital to acquire players \u2014 the team now is set now to have a first-round pick for five consecutive years \u2014 Ramsey's acquisition is undoubtedly the priciest.\n\nAt 3-3, Los Angeles is looking to push its way back into contention in the NFC after dropping its last three games and falling behind the Seattle Seahawks (5-1) and San Francisco 49ers (5-0) in their division. In two of their defeats, the Rams allowed a combined eight touchdown passes to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Jameis Winston and Seahawks' Russell Wilson.\n\nRamsey has one year remaining on his contract.\n\nThe Rams face the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, while the Jacksonville Jaguars take on the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "Jalen Ramsey finally got his wish, as the star cornerback was traded from the Jacksonville Jaguars to the Los Angeles Rams on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published P.M.
