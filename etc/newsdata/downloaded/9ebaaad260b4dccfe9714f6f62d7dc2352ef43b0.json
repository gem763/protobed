Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2019\n\nTurkey's official news agency Anadolu said eight US helicopters and two drones participated in the operation and that it lasted 90 minutes.\n\nA senior Iraqi official told the Telegraph they obtained information on Baghdadi's whereabouts from members of his inner circle, arrested in Iraq back in September.\n\n\"We arrested one of Baghdadi's wives, his nephew and the wife of one of Baghdadi's courier's,\" the official said. In interviews, the latter gave up information on the leader's whereabouts and the coordinates in Idlib. \"He wasn't very mobile\" he said, suggesting he had had been in the province for at least the last two months.\n\nHe confirmed the Iraqi National Intelligence Service shared the information with the US shortly after.\n\nIntelligence was reportedly recovered by US special forces soldiers before the compound was then hit by an air strike to prevent the building from becoming a shrine to the terror leader.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave an indication that something was afoot earlier on Saturday night when he tweeted without explanation: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nThe White House announced Mr Trump would make a \"major statement\" on Sunday at 1pm GMT, without elaborating.\n\nA Pentagon official said he was \u201cdead\u201d pending verification. It is understood that the US was currently carrying out biometric work to formally identify the dead.\n\nLeader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, Iraq, in 2014 Credit: AP More\n\nThere were no immediate statements made on Isil's official media channels, though typically it does not rush to confirm or deny such high-profile deaths in the group.\n\nExperts had speculated that Baghdadi was hiding out with a small number of cadres either in Anbar province in western Iraq or in the vast Badia desert in Homs in central Syria.\n\nHis presence in Idlib, the last-remaining anti-Assad opposition stronghold, will come as a surprise to some as the province is under the control of rebel groups hostile to Isil.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group aligned with al-Qaeda which is in control of much of the province, regularly carry out raids against Isil and arrests suspected sleeper cells.\n\nIt is unclear if he was getting protection from the rebels, but a commander with local militia Hurras al-Din group was killed in the raid.\n\n\"If Baghdadi was indeed in Barisha, it will be interesting to understand how he managed to even get there (through Syria or through Turkey?), and how it was possible for him to stay there,\" tweeted Michael Horowitz, a Middle East security analyst with the Le Beck consultancy.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, is reported to have died following\u00a0a US military raid in north-west Syria.
