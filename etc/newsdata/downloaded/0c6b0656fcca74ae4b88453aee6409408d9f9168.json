That means they would be left with a precarious immigration status even if their sentence ends before the deadline.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is consistent with EU law on free movement, as currently given effect in the UK by the Immigration Regulations 2016. This provision applies to children in detention as it does for all applicants to the EU settlement scheme.\u201d\n\nKathryn Hollingsworth, a professor of law at Newcastle University, said she was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d by the response, warning that children could be left in a \u201chighly precarious\u201d position if they were released after the deadline for applying.\n\n\u201cNot only are EU national children being disproportionately and doubly punished for mistakes made in childhood \u2013 that is, they are experiencing secondary harms of punishment that UK citizen children will not \u2013 it also leaves them with a precarious immigration status, which may heighten the likelihood of re-offending,\u201d she said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

However, by depriving EU national children of the opportunity to apply for EU settled status whilst in custody, and by \u2018resetting the clock\u2019 on the continuous residence requirement, this aim is undermined.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Ms Green called on the government to set out a process to ensure that children who had been in detention were able to obtain settled status whenever that is in their best interests, adding that youngsters who had served time in custody were often \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d.\n\nChai Patel, legal director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \u201cAll EU citizens and their family members resident in the UK were promised that their rights would not be affected by Brexit. On top of that, the government has a legal duty to act in the best interests of children.\n\n\u201cIt is simply wrong that vulnerable children, many of whom will have grown up in the UK and who are eligible for settled status, could face being removed or detained because they\u2019re not even allowed to apply.\u201d\n\nHome Office spokesperson said: \u201cAn application to the EU settlement scheme will be refused if it meets the deportation threshold. All applications from those aged 10 and over are checked to see whether the applicant has a criminal record.\u201d", "description": "Dozens of vulnerable EU children serving jail sentences in Britain could be stripped of their immigration rights after Brexit because the Home Office is refusing to let them apply for settled status.
