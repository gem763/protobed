For that reason my preference would be for something even stronger than the resolution that the House passed yesterday which has some serious weaknesses,' McConnell said from the Senate floor Thursday.\n\nThe vote Wednesday \u2013 where more than a hundred Republicans broke ranks with the president \u2013 showed the overwhelming bipartisan opposition to Trump's decision to remove troops from a region as Turkey took military action against Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he wants 'something even stronger' than the House resolution condemning Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria as the Turkish invasion targeted Kurdish forces there last week\n\nIn Wednesday's vote, 129 GOP House lawmakers agreed to the bipartisan resolution, including top Republicans Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (left) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (right). McConnell broke with Trump as well, claiming there needs to be more legislative action against the withdraw\n\nThe vote ended up at 354-60, with all 'no' votes coming from GOP lawmakers.\n\nSome notable Republicans who voted for the resolution were Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney and Texas Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nMcCaul cosponsored the legislation with Eliot Engel, the panel's Democratic chairman.\n\nForeign Affairs is also one of the six House committees jointly conducting an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nMcConnell argues that the House's resolution on Syria is too 'backward-looking' and 'narrowly drafted,' as it doesn't address Sunni Arab or Christian communities in Syria.\n\n'It is curiously silent on the issue of whether to actually sustain a U.S. military presence in Syria, perhaps to spare Democrats from having to go on record on this question. So my first preference is for something stronger than the House resolution,' McConnell said.\n\nSome Senate Democrats, including those running for president, have said they oppose Trump's decision but are hesitant to say whether they would want to bring back troops to the region after their withdrawal.\n\nLawmakers are weighing the most appropriate way to respond, and even some of the president's most fierce allies in Congress have gone against him on this issue.\n\nMcConnell, a Repiblican from Kentucky, is against the House's impeachment inquiry into the president and said he would put a stop to it should the House vote to move the proceedings onto the next step in the Senate.\n\nThe Republican Senate leader has not given any specifics on legislation he could bring to the floor that would take the House's resolution a step further.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, he called the withdrawal a 'mistake.'\n\n'I look forward to continuing to engage with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we chart the right course,' he added.\n\nThis is one of the first times Trump is facing fierce opposition from within his own party\n\nRepublican Senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham, who often publicly defends Trump, said he would become the president's 'worst nightmare' for withdrawing troops and allowing the Kurds to become more susceptible to the Turkish invasion.\n\n'I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump's worst nightmare,' Graham vowed on Wednesday. 'I will not sit along the sidelines and watch a good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey.'\n\nGraham, along with Democratic Senator Chris Van Holland of Maryland, will introduce a sanctions bill later on Thursday that will target Turkey's military and energy sector.\n\nSome of the Republicans who voted for the bipartisan resolution were part of that small group of lawmakers from both chambers who met with Trump at the White House about the withdrawal \u2013 a meeting that swiftly went haywire.\n\nDemocrats ended up walking out of the meeting and accused Trump of 'derogatory' comments and claimed he had a 'meltdown.'\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced later on Wednesday that Trump had abruptly canceled an all-member classified briefing on the situation in Syria originally scheduled for Thursday.", "description": "Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he wants 'something even stronger'  in the Senate than the House's resolution formally opposing Donald Trump's troop withdrawal from northern Syria last week.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/18/19846904-0-image-a-2_1571332161186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
