He\u2019s no good.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking to bring in a replacement tomorrow, but we\u2019ve got to through that process.\u201d\n\nGatland added: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for him. We\u2019ll keep him out here. It will be nice for him to stay out for the next couple of weeks. He\u2019ll obviously lose his accreditation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for us to have a player ruled out.\n\n\u201cIn saying that, these games are so physical to have only lost one player is a real positive for us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty lucky. We\u2019re trying to keep everyone as healthy as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nThe Wales coach confirmed they won\u2019t be bringing in another back-rower as a replacement and had yet to make the decision on who will be called up.\n\nMeanwhile, Wales are also sweating on the fitness of centre Jonathan Davies who was a last-minute withdrawal ahead of the France match.\n\nWales and the Springboks will clash in the semi-finals on Sunday, October 27 at 11:00 SA time.", "description": "Wales coach Warren Gatland has confirmed that star loose forward Josh Navidi has been ruled out of the remainder of the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7960/c40c182e128d4e0da8b205f034425d05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
