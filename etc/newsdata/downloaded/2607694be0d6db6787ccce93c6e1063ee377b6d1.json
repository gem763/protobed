REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Julian Dunkerton, the founder of British fashion group Superdry (SDRY.L), has become the firm\u2019s permanent chief executive after he won an acrimonious battle for control in April, it said on Monday.\n\nDunkerton, the group\u2019s biggest shareholder with an 18.5% stake, rejoined the board in April, prompting the existing directors, including chief executive Euan Sutherland, to resign en masse.\n\nHaving served as interim CEO since April 2, Dunkerton\u2019s title will now be CEO and his contract will run until April 2021.\n\nDunkerton\u2019s return followed a string of profit warnings as the retailer struggled to expand beyond its sweatshirts, hoodies and jackets with random Japanese text and as demand fell in its wholesale and ecommerce business.\n\nIn July the group reported a pretax loss of 85.4 million pounds for the 2018-19 year. Its shares have fallen 56% over the last year.\n\nSuperdry\u2019s board said Dunkerton had agreed to continue in the role, overseeing his strategy to restore the brand to its design-led roots and lead the business back to growth.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement reflects the board\u2019s unanimous view that he is the right person to lead the business through this initial crucial phase of the turnaround,\u201d it said.\n\nSuperdry said the board\u2019s nomination committee will continue the process to find a long-term CEO successor.\n\nDunkerton said his plan was \u201cseeing early signs of progress\u201d but cautioned \u201cthis will take time\u201d.", "description": "Julian Dunkerton, the founder of British fashion group Superdry , has become the firm's permanent chief executive after he won an acrimonious battle for control in April, it said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440615295&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0FK", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
