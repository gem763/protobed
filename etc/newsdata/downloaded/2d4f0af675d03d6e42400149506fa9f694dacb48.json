The latest development seems to be causing the game\u2019s powerful, much-hated mechs to explode, finally removing them from the game.\n\nFollowing yesterday\u2019s 10.40 patch, players have been noticing that the mechs are exploding when they hit the ground. Kotaku verified this occurrence in-game. Eurogamer points out that this seems to be related to computer monitors in Dusty Depot showing that the mechs have been infected with a virus. This might be the work of The Visitor, who, lore has it, was responsible for Season 4\u2019s rocket launch and has been destroying Season 10\u2019s time rifts to construct a new rocket.\n\nIn August, the Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a mech undergoing some kind of alteration, reflected in the Visitor\u2019s visor. Whatever the mysterious character\u2019s plans are, they seem to be coming to fruition.\n\nalso the mech's are having a rough time today pic.twitter.com/ZpOfi2X257 \u2014 Lucas7yoshi // Fortnite Leaks (@Lucas7yoshi) September 25, 2019\n\nAt best, Fortnite lore is maddeningly confusing. Whether you understand what the hell is happening or not, the long and short of it is that mechs are basically gone, a development that\u2019s pleasing many players. Calls to remove the vehicle began as soon as it was introduced at the beginning of Season 10, with angry players citing its high damage and ability to rapidly farm materials.\n\nEpic\u2019s reasoning that the mech gave less skilled or less experienced players a way to win a match caused even more fervour. Despite several tweaks to the mech over the course of the season, players have continued to find it overpowered.\n\nWhile some players are citing community outrage as the cause of the mech\u2019s removal, others are pointing out that it\u2019s all in service of Fortnite\u2019s lore.\n\n\u201cWe had to suffer through weeks of [the mechs\u2019] bs just so they can be a part of this season\u2019s story,\u201d one player on Reddit said. \u201c[Epic] seriously did this because of the LORE after millions of complaints online and people quitting the game? Amazing, honestly,\u201d wrote another.\n\nFor the most part, though, anti-mech players are glad that, whatever the reason, they finally got what they wanted. Those mechs aren\u2019t so tough now, are they?", "description": "Fortnite\u2019s Season 10 is in its last weeks, which means the game\u2019s ever-evolving plot is coming to the fore.
