REUTERS/David Gray\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - A closely watched measure of Australian business confidence edged lower in September while business conditions remained sub-par, indicating aggressive rate cuts have been unable to lift the mood in the corporate sector, a survey showed on Tuesday.\n\nNational Australia Bank Ltd\u2019s (NAB) (NAB.AX) index of business conditions inched up 1 point to +2 in September, but still recorded a sixth consecutive below-average month.
