The Forest Service's proposal, if approved by the Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, would eliminate that rule for the Tongass and convert 165,000 acres of old-growth and 20,000 acres of young-growth to suitable timber lands.\n\nCritics of the Roadless Rule say it hamstrings Alaska's economy and hampers development for the 32 communities, including the state's capital city of Juneau, that call the Tongass home.\n\nAlaska Gov. Michael Dunleavy and the state's congressional delegation, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski, welcomed the Trump administration's proposal.\n\nDefenders of the Roadless Rule are adamant that it should stay in place to protect wildlife habitat, recreation and industries such as fishing and tourism.\n\nLike many conservationists, Anthony Christianson was girding for last week's announcement. He's the mayor of Hydaburg, a city of approximately 400 people nestled on Prince of Wales Island in southeast Alaska. Speaking with NPR's Short Wave podcast earlier this month, he shared his concerns about the forest's future.\n\n\"If there's one book that made me question this, it was Dr. Seuss' The Lorax,\" Christianson said. \"A picture of him sitting on the last stump. He's sitting there with an empty landscape and no trees. That vision flashed in my head this last week.\"\n\nAt nearly 17 million acres, the Tongass rainforest houses considerable stands of old-growth forest, with trees more than 800 years old. Christianson and his family have hunted and fished for generations in these old-growth stands. He is a member of the Haida tribe, and the Tongass is their indigenous land.\n\n\"I am comprised of elements of the land around me,\" Christianson said. \"I've lived on deer meat and berries and fish my whole life. It's the main staple at my family dinner. Last night, it was fried sockeye and greens off the beach. So it definitely shapes the community here.\"\n\nThe Tongass National Forest is also a natural carbon sink, holding an estimated 8% of all carbon stored in U.S. national forests.\n\nThe idea of expanding logging in the Tongass concerns Dominick DellaSala, president and chief scientist of the Geos Institute in Oregon. \"We need those rainforests to survive,\" he said. \"The trees will do fine without us, but they're pulling that carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and acting as the planet's lungs.\"\n\nTrees draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in their leaves, stems, branches and roots, locking it away for centuries.\n\n\"When we clear-cut a rainforest, most of that carbon that was in the tree winds up as a pollutant in the atmosphere, contributing to global overheating that we're going through now,\" DellaSala said.\n\nLast week, the Forest Service published a 585-page draft environmental impact statement outlining six alternatives for how the Roadless Rule could apply to Alaska. The first alternative calls for no change to the rule. The sixth alternative \u2014 which is the Forest Service's \"preferred alternative\" \u2014 would fully exempt the Tongass from the Roadless Rule.\n\nThe public has 60-days to submit written comment on the proposal before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue makes a final decision, expected by June 2020.\n\nThe audio version of this story was produced by Rebecca Ramirez and edited by Viet Le.", "description": "The world's largest intact temperate rainforest is in a place you may not expect: southeast Alaska.
