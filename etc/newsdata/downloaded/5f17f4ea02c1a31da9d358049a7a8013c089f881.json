It had never looked worse and I had never been more proud of it,' she said reflecting on having a child in May 2009.\n\nConstance Hall, 36, (pictured with four of her seven children) told how understanding the power of her vagina has improved her sex life\n\nThe parenting blogger who experienced men becoming uninterested after having sex, would advise other women to find power in their vagina by withholding sex\n\nConstance revealed that she had previously thought the power of her vagina came from her abilities in the bedroom or withholding sex to keep men interested in pursuing her.\n\nShe told how the boy who she lost her virginity to her at age 14, didn't see her again romantically after they had slept together.\n\n'I grew to learn that boys would follow me around like a fart that I couldn\u2019t deny until I gave them the all powerful p****, and then the power slowly slipped. It seemed to quickly shift from them chasing me to me chasing them, from them calling me 50 times a week to a text message returned 3 days later,' she said.\n\nThe mother-of-seven admits she began to wonder if she was bad in bed and found that she was only able to have an orgasm by masturbating.\n\nConstance (pictured with her husband Denim Cooke) came to the realisation of her vagina's power after giving birth to her children\n\nConstance, who would encourage other young women to abstain from having sex, except with men who proved they were truly invested, said sex became 'a relatively disempowering act, a box to be ticked'.\n\nShe links her new found enjoyment of sex to finding an appreciation of her vagina and embracing how her body has changed with age.\n\nSince the birth of her children, the mother-of-seven has accepted that her vagina isn't perfect, but is capable of cleaning itself and providing innocent pleasure with orgasms.\n\nConstance said learning the power of her vagina has enabled her to have 'real sex' that ends with two people climaxing.\n\nThe blogger, who has four children from a previous marriage, welcomed her fifth with new second husband Denim Cooke, and is a stepmother to Cooke's two children.\n\nShe recently made headlines after sharing a candid photograph on social media in the hopes of inspiring her fans not to conform.\n\nThe blogger (pictured with her family) praised her vagina's ability to clean itself, push out children and to give pleasure", "description": "Australian blogger Constance Hall, 36, who has gained a following for her honest posts on parental sex, revealed her sex life improved after she accepted the power of her vagina.", "authors": ["Latoya Gayle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19846360-0-image-a-2_1571328058642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
