Additionally, U.S. monitoring of Chinese compliance with such an agreement would require large-scale intelligence resources from spy agencies already taxed with monitoring global hot spots and other threats.\n\nA next round of trade talks is expected to take place in Washington this month.\n\nWhen U.S. and Chinese officials met last month in Beijing, the talks hit an impasse with Beijing officials digging in their heels in refusing to acknowledge past illicit activities.\n\nThe administration is under pressure from pro-China elements on Wall Street who are pushing what was described as a \u201chalfway\u201d deal. The pro-China advocates want to make new concessions to Beijing in exchange for President Xi Jinping\u2019s government promising to open up China\u2019s financial markets to American competitors.\n\nChina\u2019s strategy also appears to be aimed at waiting out President Trump in hopes he will lose the 2020 election. Beijing influence operations have targeted U.S. farm states and the whisky industry in a bid to undermine the administration\u2019s tough stance toward China.\n\nMr. Trump on Tuesday tweeted that the United States is doing very well in its talks with China.\n\n\u201cWhile I am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of \u2018ripoff USA\u2019 ($600 B/year), 16 months PLUS is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long shot,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president then warned the Chinese that he will take an even harder line upon his reelection.\n\n\u201cAnd then, think what happens to China when I win,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDeal would get MUCH TOUGHER! In the meantime, China\u2019s Supply Chain will crumble and businesses, jobs and money will be gone!\u201d\n\nChina eying Hong Kong crackdown\n\nThe Trump administration is increasingly concerned China is preparing for a military crackdown in Hong Kong, despite the announcement by the Beijing-linked chief executive that the controversial extradition bill that triggered the latest mass protests has been tabled.\n\nRecently, American intelligence agencies detected a large shipment of Chinese troops and armored vehicles to Hong Kong, according to U.S. officials. No details of the shipment were provided, but a report from Hong Kong by the defense publication Shephard Media reported that a large Chinese cargo ship delivered troops and equipment on Aug. 28 at the Stonecutters Island Naval Base in Hong Kong.\n\nThe report stated that the ship was the Chang Da Long, a vehicle carrier.\n\nThe ship was supplying a rotation of forces for China\u2019s 5,000-troop People\u2019s Liberation Army Hong Kong garrison, the force that would likely be called on to conduct a crackdown and imposition of martial rule in the former British colony.\n\nThe ship also was tracked from nearby Shenzhen where personnel from the Chinese People\u2019s Armed Police have been photographed assembling.\n\nThe report said that the ship appeared to be operating in a disguised mode with its automated identification system turned off.\n\nAnother ominous indicator was the comments of Xy Luying, a spokeswoman for China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. Ms. Xy told reporters on Tuesday that the PLA garrison in Hong Kong would be used to \u201csafeguard\u201d national sovereignty.\n\nShe added that the use of military troops would not end the \u201cone country/two systems\u201d policy designed to protect the city\u2019s semi-autonomous status.\n\nChina\u2019s leaders in Beijing are attempting to quell the sometimes violent protests in Hong Kong, over concerns the unrest will upset plans for the major 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party on Oct. 1.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Wednesday the withdrawal of the controversial extradition bill that would have allowed authorities to send people from Hong Kong to China where courts are controlled by the Communist Party of China.\n\nPro-democracy protests, including one mass gatherings of up to 1.7 million Hong Kongers, demanded that the bill be withdrawn as a violation of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d pledge dating back to the days when the colony reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\n\u201cLingering violence is damaging the very foundations of our society, especially the rule of law,\u201d Ms. Lam said in her public address.\n\nReports from Hong Kong reveal that Chinese security and intelligence forces have been conducting arrests and beatings of protest leaders in an effort to quell the unrest without resorting to military force.\n\nThere also were reports that Chinese security personnel were operating undercover as protesters and engaged in provocative activities, including the tossing of Molotov cocktails fuel bombs.\n\nPentagon on insider threat\n\nThe Pentagon announced this week it will continue work to uncover \u201cinsider threats,\u201d along with a government entity called the National Insider Threat Task Force. The effort is part of an initiative by the Director of National Intelligence National Counterintelligence and Security Center. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security also are taking part.\n\nIn a statement, the Pentagon said September was designated \u201cinsider threat awareness month.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsider threat awareness is about enabling employees to recognize the indicators to deter, detect and mitigate actions by insiders who may represent a threat to national security,\u201d said Garry Reid, director for defense intelligence in the office of the undersecretary of defense for intelligence.\n\nThe Pentagon has been victimized by two notorious insiders.\n\nArmy Pvt. Bradley Manning leaked tens of thousands of secret cables and other secret documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Manning was court-martialed and imprisoned in 2010 for the leaks but the sentence was commuted by President Obama in 2017, sending a mixed signal regarding the government\u2019s seriousness about insider threats.\n\nThen came National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked downloaded 1.7 million intelligence documents and gave them to reporters. The documents outlined NSA\u2019s electronic spying capabilities.\n\nSnowden is currently in Moscow under Russian government protection.\n\nThe Pentagon statement said past compromises of national security information by trusted insiders \u201cmade America less safe by allowing adversaries unauthorized access to information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdversaries have used the knowledge from insiders to change tactics to avoid detection and learn where the nation is most vulnerable,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThese actions, coupled with incidents of senseless loss of life perpetrated by insiders, have highlighted the need for uniform engagement.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
