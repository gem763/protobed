Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, Michael Cohen \u2014 the list of indicted conspirators is a who\u2019s who of cheap mafioso knockoffs.\n\nNot on that list: anyone from the Trump family tree.\n\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s refusal to indict the president or his family is presented as favorable evidence by the White House and its allies to suggest Trump was somehow vindicated and acquitted of any wrongdoing. Not only did Mueller not acquit Trump, now it turns out the White House\u2019s celebration for avoiding indictments may have been a bit premature.\n\nHouse Democrats, back in session after the summer recess, are reportedly preparing to launch a comprehensive investigation into hush-money payments made on Trump\u2019s behalf to at least two women \u2014 former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Both women say they had affairs with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetails of those payments were largely made public over a year ago, during the height of Mueller\u2019s wide-ranging investigation. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and fixer, cooperated with the investigation and with lawmakers, outlining the setup he arranged to pay off Daniels to keep her from going public with her story. McDougal was given a similar financial arrangement by the owners of the National Enquirer.\n\nMueller\u2019s team passed on its findings to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who had jurisdiction over possible criminal charges. Cohen is currently serving a three-year prison sentence, but prosecutors declined to pursue any further criminal charges, even after Cohen testified under oath that Trump was the one who directed him to make the illegal payments.\n\nNow, the House Judiciary Committee will pick up where federal prosecutors left off. According to the Washington Post, Democrats on the committee are preparing to schedule hearings on the matter and are eyeing possible witnesses to bring before Congress and answer questions about Trump\u2019s involvement in the payments.\n\nPerhaps most notable among the potential witnesses is David Pecker, the chairman and CEO of American Media Inc., which owns the National Enquirer. Pecker is a longtime Trump confidant and the architect of the tabloid\u2019s \u201ccatch and kill\u201d policy that resulted in the payout to McDougal.\n\nIn the weeks before the 2016 election, documents show, Cohen facilitated various conversations with Pecker, Trump, and National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard. The contents and timing of those messages and conversations were enough to prompt one FBI agent to posit that one purpose of those communications was to prevent Daniels from going public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s knowledge of and possible involvement in the Stormy Daniels hush money drama is still under debate. First, the White House denied Trump had an affair with Daniels. After the Wall Street Journal broke the news of the hush money payments, Trump himself denied having any knowledge of the financial arrangement. Then his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani acknowledged that the president had reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 he paid Daniels.\n\nDepending on what the Judiciary Committee unearths, Donald Trump might not be out of the woods just yet when it comes to legal repercussions.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-947146032.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
