Taylor Jr., the United States\u2019 top diplomat in Ukraine, told impeachment investigators privately on Tuesday that President Trump held up vital security aid for the country and refused a White House meeting with Ukraine\u2019s leader until he agreed to make a public pronouncement pledging to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nIn testimony that Democrats in attendance called the most damaging account yet for the president, Mr. Taylor provided an \u201cexcruciatingly detailed\u201d opening statement that described in blunt and unsparing terms the quid-pro-quo pressure campaign that Mr. Trump and his allies have long denied.\n\nWhen he objected to that effort, Mr. Taylor said in his opening statement obtained by The New York Times, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union and a Trump campaign donor, sought to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s actions by noting that he was a businessman. Mr. Taylor recounted Mr. Sondland saying that, \u201cwhen a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor\u2019s testimony directly contradicted repeated assertions by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies that there was never a quid pro quo involving investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that employed Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and other Democrats.", "description": "In closed-door testimony, a Democratic lawmaker said, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, drew a \u201cdirect line\u201d between President Trump\u2019s withholding of security aid and his demand for investigations.", "authors": ["Michael D.
