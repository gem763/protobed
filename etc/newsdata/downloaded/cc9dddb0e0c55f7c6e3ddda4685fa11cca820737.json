Police believe Hangud \"drove from Roseville and travelled to unknown places in Northern California, and ended up in Mount Shasta,\" Simon said.\n\nCourt records show that Hangud's only previous encounter with law enforcement was for speeding in Placer County in 2016 in 2001.\n\n\"This incident has touched the lives of many in the area,\" Simon said at a news conference on Tuesday, adding such a killing had not occurred in the Placer County city of 130,000 in his recent memory. \"It's a very sad, sad situation.\"\n\n\"The suspect himself drove to the Mt. Shasta Police Department with one of the victims in his car and made a confession to them to start off this investigation,\" Simon said.\n\nMt. Shasta Police chief Parish Cross said he and another officer went outside to the car to verify what the man had said was true. \"These are things that just don't happen everyday and when they do, it is upsetting,\" said Cross.\n\n\"I've been in the business for a long time and I've seen a lot of unusual occurrences, just upsetting occurrences, but this one here is a whole new level. We are still in shock,\" said an official at KDRV.com, an affiliate of the ABC Television Network, reported.", "description": "Police officers in Roseville, Northern California were left shocked after a man casually walked into the police station and told them that there was a dead body in his car.
