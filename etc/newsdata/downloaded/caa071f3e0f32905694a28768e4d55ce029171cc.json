The Buffalo Bills released LeSean McCoy (who quickly caught on with his former coach). The New England Patriots cut Demaryius Thomas.\n\nPerhaps most strangely of all, three teams cut all of their healthy backup quarterbacks.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks, Denver Broncos and Indianapolis Colts are all down to one quarterback on their active roster, leaving them with plenty of questions ahead of Week 1 next Sunday.\n\nWhat circumstances led to this?\n\nThe Colts are perhaps the least surprising team to be dealing with this situation, considering Andrew Luck\u2019s surprise retirement last weekend. They were likely content with Jacoby Brissett as an overqualified backup and didn\u2019t need a strong third-stringer.\n\nHowever, the Colts deemed Phillip Walker not worth keeping, and troubled backup Chad Kelly is already suspended for the first two games of the season for a trespassing incident.\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nThe Broncos have a similar situation, knowing that second-rounder Drew Lock would be unavailable to start the year, this time with a thumb injury he suffered during preseason. They willingly cut Kevin Hogan, leaving them without a backup for Joe Flacco and Lock unable to return until Week 9.\n\n\u201c[We] needed the [roster] spot,\u201d Broncos general manager John Elway told NFL.com. \u201cWith Drew being out six to eight weeks, [we] figured the best thing for us as a team was to use that spot.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Seahawks, meanwhile, have no other quarterbacks left on the team to back up Russell Wilson \u2014 healthy, injured or suspended. They cut former Broncos first-rounder Paxton Lynch on Friday after he lost the backup job to Geno Smith. But in a surprise move one day later, the Seahawks cut Smith as well.\n\nThe Seahawks are not carrying a quarterback to back up Russell Wilson with the first game of the regular season a week away. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nWhat would these teams do with an injured starter?\n\nSurely there are moves left to be made before Week 1 begins, as it would be ludicrous for three NFL teams to play without a backup quarterback. Just don\u2019t bet on Colin Kaepernick returning, since the NFL is only ready to profit off him when it comes to merchandise.\n\nThe real question becomes what would any of these teams do in the unfortunate situation in which they don\u2019t carry a backup on their active roster and their starter gets hurt during a game.\n\nWhile there may be a high school quarterback hidden among the skill position players, the most likely scenario is something that happened to the Carolina Panthers in 2006.\n\nWhen starter Jake Delhomme went down, they turned to 34-year-old former Heisman Trophy winner Chris Weinke, who turned into a glorified hand-off machine. In a Week 16 game against the Atlanta Falcons, they ran the ball on the first 12 plays of the game, stretching their opening drive into the second quarter, and won 10-3 with 52 rushes to just seven pass attempts. They were somehow able to sneak out a win by cutting down the number of possessions and running the ball effectively.\n\nOf course, the most logical solution here would be to just bite the bullet and sign a competent backup, even just for two weeks in the Colts\u2019 case. But one can still dream of a purely running or even triple option offense in the mean time.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The three teams will surely sign a new backup in the next week unless they don't want any Plan B.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.G8KZvBNwlolImplSDjuHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/esgErFfCzQZNy8Rbmp2AQw--~B/aD0yMDc2O3c9MzY5MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e51577c0-ccbf-11e9-be2e-74956326f37f"}
