Please check in for the latest from the hearing.\n\nIn Advance:\n\nIn a much-anticipated meeting of politics and tech, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has finally made his way to United States regulators. He will be testifying before the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s Libra. The planned stablecoin has been the subject of much controversy since it\u2019s June whitepaper. Days after, Chairwoman of the committee Maxine Waters called for a moratorium on Libra\u2019s development.\n\nAccording to Zuckerberg\u2019s prepared remarks released yesterday, he plans to assure the committee that Facebook will not launch Libra anywhere in the world without having satisfied U.S. regulators. Expect the representatives of the committee to be skeptical of this claim.\n\n10:07 The Hearing begins\n\nChairwoman Maxine Waters began the hearing by calling the committee to order. Rep. Waters\u2019 skepticism of Facebook\u2019s intentions are well-documented.\n\nIn her opening remarks, Representative Waters suggested that the best course of action would be \u201cif Facebook concentrates on addressing existing deficiencies and issues before proceeding with Libra.\u201d The Chairwoman named staff discrimination, anti-trust concerns, consumer trust, and the 2016 elections as preeminent among these.\n\nRanking Member Patrick McHenry began his comments by declaring that \u201cToday is a trial on American innovation.\u201d In a comment on modern dependence on technology, he noted that most of the members of congress were checking their phones \u201cright now.\u201d To Zuckerberg: \u201cFair or not fair, you\u2019re here to answer for the digital age.\u201d\n\n10:21 Zuckerberg\u2019s opening remarks\n\nFollowing an appeal the vast global unbanked, Zuckerberg said that \u201cThe financial industry is stagnant. There is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation that we need.\u201d He went on to say \u201cI don\u2019t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe in trying new things.\u201d\n\n10:25 Questioning begins\n\nIn her questions to Zuckerberg, Chairwoman Waters referred to an earlier ban on cryptocurrencies on Facebook, accusing the company of changing its tune only when it realized how much it could dominate the market.\n\nRep. McHenry\u2019s line of questioning began by asking about China, especially concerned with the rise in China\u2019s technology companies. Zuckerberg: \u201cToday, 6 out of 10 of the top tech companies are coming out of China and certainly don\u2019t share our values.\u201d This seems to play into a longer-term argument that Libra is the U.S.\u2019s best chance against China\u2019s crypto development. McHenry pushed the question, however: \u201cWhy not just do a Facebook version of Alipay?\u201d\n\nSwitching back to domestic regulator concerns, Rep. Mahoney asked Zuckerberg what he meant by approval from all U.S. regulators, given the number of agencies and entities in play. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to getting all of the appropriate approvals,\u201d Zuckerberg answered.", "description": "Cointelegraph brings you live coverage of Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the United States House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s Libra", "authors": ["Kollen Post"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9iODNjOWFhZjU4YzMzZmZlZmZkMThkOTNiNjhiMjdiNC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
