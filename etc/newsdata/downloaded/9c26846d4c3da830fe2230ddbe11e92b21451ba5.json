Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who faced pressure to demonstrate his vitality to serve as president.\n\nSanders\u2019 health may not have been the debate\u2019s central focus, but with an energetic performance he achieved the goal his campaign had set for him. Notwithstanding an occasional rasp in his voice, Sanders sounded as alert, impassioned and articulate as he ever has.\n\nThe 12-candidate showdown at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, was his first campaign event since his hospitalization for a heart attack nearly two weeks ago.\n\nWith public polling showing Democrats doubting his physical viability, campaign aides vowed that the 78-year-old would assuage such concerns with a robust showing in the three-hour faceoff.\n\nHe set the tone early, inserting himself into an exchange about the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to expound on a different topic.\n\nDiscussing the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Sanders reiterated one of his campaign\u2019s enduring themes: That impeaching Trump \u2015 or otherwise confronting his crimes \u2015 is no substitute for delivering real economic relief for ordinary Americans.\n\nSanders supports the president\u2019s ouster from office, but he said, \u201cWhat would be a disaster if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump, and we\u2019re forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, we\u2019re forgetting about the existential threat of climate change, we are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\u201cWhat we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.\u201d\n\nTime and again during the debate\u2019s first hour, Sanders deployed the mix of passion, moral clarity, anger and dry wit that he is capable of when he is at his best.\n\nAs part of a prolonged exchange over the middle-class tax hikes that his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan entails, Sanders managed to at once shame centrist critics and draw a subtle contrast with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Warren, unlike Sanders, will not explicitly say that her support for the plan is tantamount to backing a tax increase for non-affluent earners.\n\n\u201cI do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up,\u201d he said.\n\nWithout naming them though, he saved his real ire for the likes of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who teamed up against Warren over her reluctance to explicitly defend tax increases that would help fund Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cThe issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\u201d he said, prompting applause from the audience. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 health and fitness to serve in the White House did not come up until the end of the second hour of the debate. CNN\u2019s moderators asked him, Biden and Warren \u2015 all of whom are septuagenarians and, if elected, would be the oldest to ever become a U.S. president \u2015 to speak directly to skepticism about their viability.\n\nSanders began with a booming, if unrelated, riff on how the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture opiates and the fossil-fuel companies profiting from climate change embody the perils of \u201cunfettered capitalism.\u201d\n\nPressed again to address the health issue, Sanders invited everyone watching to attend his campaign\u2019s first rally since his heart attack \u2015 a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d gathering on the East River waterfront in Queens on Saturday. Sanders noted that an unnamed \u201cspecial guest\u201d would be there, and he extended a warm thank you to all those in the country who had reached out to express their concern while he was ill.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country \u2015 that is how I think I can reassure the American people,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Vermont senator was energetic in his first campaign event since suffering a heart attack.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da67ec7200000b00c5056dd.jpeg?cache=fmbotjfsjk&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
