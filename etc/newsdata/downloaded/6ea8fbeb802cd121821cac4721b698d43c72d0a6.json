He said the shutdown was necessary to allow him to introduce a new legislative agenda.\n\nOpponents said the real reason was to prevent scrutiny and challenges by parliament - where he now has no majority - to his Brexit policy, especially his promise to leave the European Union by Oct. 31 even if no divorce deal has been agreed.\n\nThey want the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom\u2019s highest judicial body, to rule Johnson\u2019s actions were illegal. Critics, including rebels thrown out of his Conservative Party over Brexit, say he should resign if that is its decision.\n\n\u201cThe consequence (of his advice to the monarch being ruled unlawful) could be that he goes to the queen and seeks the recall of parliament,\u201d Richard Keen, the government\u2019s chief law officer in Scotland, told the court.\n\nHowever, Keen was unable to rule out that Johnson might then look to suspend parliament again.\n\nIn a damning judgement last Wednesday, Scotland\u2019s highest court said the suspension was unlawful and an \u201cegregious\u201d attempt to stymie parliament.\n\nHowever, a week earlier the High Court of England and Wales rejected a similar case, saying the matter was political and not something judges should interfere in.\n\nAll 11 judges on the Supreme Court will now decide on a crucial question: how far Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution limits the power of the prime minister and whether Johnson\u2019s advice to the queen was therefore illegal.\n\n\u201cThat this is a serious and difficult question of law is amply demonstrated by the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion from three senior judges in England and Wales,\u201d said Brenda Hale, president of the Supreme Court.\n\nFILE PHOTO: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves after a meeting with Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel in Luxembourg, September 16, 2019.

But asked by one judge if Johnson might seek another suspension, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to comment on that.\u201d\n\nHe argued that only seven working days would be lost through the suspension, not five weeks, because parliament would be on holiday in late September as parties held annual conferences. He said the Scottish judges had a \u201cfundamental misconception\u201d about how parliament operated.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe government says opponents of Brexit are using the courts to try to frustrate Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc which was approved in a 2016 referendum. But Pannick said the aim was to establish that parliament was supreme in British law and not the government.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled against the government in a similar constitutional case in 2017 when it said ministers could not begin the formal two-year exit process without the approval of parliament. Its hearings will run until Thursday, with the verdict not expected until Friday at the earliest.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasise that we are not concerned with the wider political issues which form the context for this legal issue,\u201d Hale said. \u201cThe determination of this legal issue will not determine when and how the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson could recall parliament if Britain's highest court rules he unlawfully suspended it, a government lawyer said on Tuesday, after judges heard the prime minister wanted a shutdown because it was an obstacle to his Brexit plans.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430867714&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1TU", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
