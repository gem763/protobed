We\u2019ll look in the morning\u2019\n\nEngland have been handed a major World Cup scare with Billy Vunipola suffering a twisted ankle in victory over Argentina. England booked their place in the quarter-finals after Tom\u00e1s Lavanini was sent off for a shoulder to Owen Farrell\u2019s head in the first half. But Eddie Jones is sweating on the fitness of Vunipola, who did not return to the field after half-time and will be assessed on Sunday.\n\nVunipola was starting his 12th consecutive match for England and his seventh in two months, having been named at No 8 in the three World Cup matches and the four warm-up games.\n\nJones bristled at suggestions before England\u2019s victory over the USA last week that he was taking a risk by not resting Vunipola but he now faces an anxious wait over the Saracens forward.\n\nEngland 39-10 Argentina talking points: a wild big hit and a Billy beef | Paul Rees Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a look at in the morning and see what it\u2019s like,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s twisted his ankle but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s too serious.\u201d\n\nVunipola appeared to suffer the injury to his left ankle during the first half. He received attention from the England medical staff and played on until half-time with his ankle heavily strapped. He did not re-emerge, however, and was conspicuous by his absence after full-time when the rest of the squad were conducting their celebrations on the pitch.\n\nIf Jones were to lose Vunipola it would be a hammer blow to his side\u2019s World Cup chances. There is no like-for-like replacement within the squad \u2013 he was replaced by Lewis Ludlam, who is a flanker by trade \u2013 while Mark Wilson is the only other member of the squad with any genuine experience of playing internationally at No 8.\n\nJust two days ago Jones said: \u201cBilly is great for us because he has got that fire and temperament and you want that from your No 8. You look at the history of the World Cups and they\u2019ve always been won by a big No 8.\u201d\n\nFarrell, meanwhile, was adamant that there are no concerns over his health after receiving a second blow to the head in the space of 10 days. Farrell was clobbered in the head by the USA\u2019s John Quill \u2013 who received the first red card of the World Cup as a result \u2013 and he was on the receiving end again in the 18th minute against the Pumas.\n\nIn the first half Farrell missed four consecutive kicks at goal \u2013 three of which came after his blow to the head \u2013 but the England captain insisted he did not need to go off the field for a head injury assessment. Against the USA, he did not leave the field either.\n\n\u201cI feel fine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously concussion that\u2019s the worry but I didn\u2019t get hit anywhere near the top of the head. Maybe your jaw gets a bit sore but I was fine and there was no need for a HIA.\u201d\n\nLavanini\u2019s red card in effect ended the match as a contest and Argentina are now resigned to exiting the World Cup in the pool stages.\n\nTheir head coach, Mario Ledesma, acknowledged that Nigel Owens\u2019s decision to issue Lavanini, who joins Leicester next season, a red card was fair, but did suggest that Manu Tuilagi was fortunate to avoid a yellow card for tackling Emiliano Boffelli in the air.\n\nThe Argentina and Saracens prop Juan Figallo agreed. \u201cWe thought Manu\u2019s tackle was a yellow card,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could have helped us because it was early in the game but it was the ref\u2019s decision and I won\u2019t say anything about referees.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nJones also revealed he is highly unlikely to travel back to Australia to attend the funeral of his friend and former Randwick club mentor Jeff Sayle before England\u2019s final Pool C match against France on Saturday.\n\n\u201cUnless the RFU hire a Concorde for me, it\u2019ll be quite difficult to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to go but I\u2019ve got a lot of responsibility here. I\u2019m conscious of that. The travel makes it difficult so I doubt very much that I\u2019ll be going, as much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d", "description": "England have been handed a major World Cup scare with Billy Vunipola suffering a twisted ankle in the 39-10 victory over Argentina", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f18ae5181e8158bd2cc0f8e47933ab7d0d33775/644_827_2434_1461/master/2434.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc2b46e8c26645fcbecd736793b690cc", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
