The question is: will his plan succeed?\n\nUpon learning of daughter Bex\u2019s (Jasmine Armfield) suicide attempt, Martin wasted little time in returning home to the Square. In an attempt to ensure Stacey (Lacey Turner) could also come home, he appealed to Ben\u2019s better nature. However \u2014 never one to miss an opportunity \u2014 Ben has used the leverage he has on Stace to convince Martin to help him out with his dodgy dealings.\n\nThe two have been in cahoots \u2014 against Martin\u2019s will, of course \u2014 ever since and, in the coming episodes, the fruit-and-veg stall owner begins to feel the pressure, as he must keep his work with Ben a secret \u2014 a tall task given that this is Walford we\u2019re talking about.\n\nUnable to keep it a secret any longer, Martin confides in Kush about everything \u2014 and Kush demands that they confront Ben together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, upon doing so, Ben makes it clear that he\u2019s not backing down \u2014 and Martin comes up with a plan as a result.\n\nMartin goes to Jack (Scott Maslen) and speaks to him about a \u2018friend\u2019 who\u2019s in trouble but he\u2019s ultimately left annoyed at Jack\u2019s response. However, Jacks\u2019 suspicions are piqued \u2014 and he quizzes Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) about what her ex-hubby is up to. In spite of her own concerns, Sonia covers for Martin again.\n\nMartin makes a promise to Bex that he\u2019ll spend time with her, but his plans are scuppered once Ben demands he take part in another job.\n\nLater, Tubbs finds himself arrested \u2014 and Jack watches on. Meanwhile \u2014 with Tubbs in custody \u2014 Martin manages to persuade Ben to do the job with him.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Martin has a motive \u2014 but the question is, what is it that he\u2019s up to?\n\nOne to watch: Thursday 24th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Martin is playing a dangerous game.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18692621-high-8f95_1570610373.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
