His expected veto after the latest vote would be the sixth of his presidency.\n\nOn Friday, 11 Republicans and one independent joined with 224 Democrats to rebuke Mr. Trump \u2014 about in line with the 13 Republicans who voted for the resolution in February.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the vote was about \u201cchecks and balances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s decision to cancel $3.6 billion of military construction to pay for his wasteful wall makes America less safe,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\nBut Republicans said it was about scoring political points against the president.\n\n\u201cThis has everything to do with politics,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s about this president and their opposition to a secure border.\u201d\n\nThe Senate voted 54-41 for the resolution on Wednesday, with 11 Republicans voting in favor.\n\nMr. Trump declared an emergency on the southern border in February after Congress gave him only $1.375 billion in wall money for 2019. The administration had outlined nearly $7 billion in total funds from other accounts they could tap to use for the wall.\n\nThe latest votes came after the Defense Department this month outlined more than 100 projects around the world that could be slowed or halted because of the diverted funds.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
