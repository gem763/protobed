Kim said: \"Our family knows firsthand how truly compelling television comes from real people just being themselves.\"\n\nKendall then added: \"Telling their stories unfiltered and unscripted,\" while the audience erupted in laughter and they both looked legit pissed.\n\nPrepare to watch this from behind your hands...\n\nOkay, can we talk about this moment, when Kendall and Kim said that their family know the struggle of telling stories unfiltered and unscripted and EVERYONE IN HOLLYWOOD LAUGHED AT THEM \ud83d\ude31 #Emmys2019 pic.twitter.com/WrL7469l0O \u2014 Cultura Colectiva + (@ccplus) September 23, 2019\n\nObviously, Twitter had some thoughts on the awkward moment.\n\nThe #Emmys audience laughed at Kim and Kendall when they were talking about how reality shows are all about REAL people living their lives pic.twitter.com/C1OicoGVtK \u2014 Caroline (@CIKtweets) September 23, 2019\n\nUmmmmm did the crowd really just laugh at Kim and Kendall when Kim said their family knows what it's like to be real people living their real lives???? #Emmys \u2014 bananaspop (@bananaspop1) September 23, 2019\n\nWas anyone else slightly uncomfortable when the audience laughed at Kim and Kendall when they said \u201cReal people telling real stories about themselves\u201d.. I don\u2019t think they were joking haha. Kendall looked so uncomfortable and Kim\u2019s face just tightened up.. #Emmys pic.twitter.com/h9ETwueyAR \u2014 ALEX (@TheB0Y_WhoLived) September 23, 2019\n\nOkay, so... let's unpick this a little. As far as \"unscripted\" goes, it's fair to say that KUWTK isn't - those one-liners are all Kourtney's. However, the family has been accused of engineering plot lines from time to time - including the Jordyn Woods/Tristan Thompson/Khloe Kardashian cheating scandal, which both the Kardashians and Jordyn deny doing.\n\nThe \"real people just being themselves,\" line from the speech, however, is kinda hard to relate to when the Kardashians live a very different life from the majority of us. So perhaps that's what made the audience tittle \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.\n\nStill, there's no denying the impact KUWTK has had on pop culture. So let's give them a break, shall we?\n\nFollow Abbi on Instagram.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "I. CAN'T.
