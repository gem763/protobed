(BBT) said its net income fell in its latest quarter, but the bank's top line rose as a result of higher net interest income and noninterest income.\n\nThe Winston-Salem, N.C. bank reported a third-quarter profit of $735 million, or 95 cents a share, compared with $789 million, or $1.01 a share, a year ago.\n\nAdjusted earnings, omitting items from the company's merger with SunTrust Banks Inc. and other one-time charges, were $1.07 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting earnings of $1.03 a share, or $1.06 a share on an adjusted basis.\n\nTotal revenue increased to $3.03 billion from $2.93 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected $2.99 billion in revenue.\n\nNet interest income was $1.72 billion, up slightly from $1.71 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.69 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nNoninterest income was up about 5% to $1.30 billion, in line with what analysts had expected.\n\n\"While average loans held for investment decreased 4.8%, this result was due to our strategic decision to sell approximately $4 billion in mortgage loans during the quarter,\" Chief Executive Kelly King said in a statement. \"Excluding this sale, our company generated robust loan growth of 6.5% on an annualized basis compared with last quarter.\"\n\nWrite to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 06:19 ET (10:19 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
