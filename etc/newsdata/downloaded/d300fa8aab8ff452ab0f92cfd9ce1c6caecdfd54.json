I own a bevy of teeny tiny little purses (from Ima Goa and Opening Ceremony, like the one seen above) that are very cute, but can barely fit my phone. So I\u2019ve recently been looking for a more practical, grown up bag that I can take with me to work and out at night. I spotted this Trademark bag months ago and have been fantasizing about it ever since \u2014 I love the neutral colors, cage lining, and the fact that it\u2019s big enough to fit office essentials like a notebook and a water bottle but small enough to conveniently take with me to a dive bar. I finally ordered it last week, when it went on sale, and am eagerly anticipating its arrival at my doorstep. (Note: The smaller version I have has sold out, but the larger, laptop-friendly version is still available.)", "description": "The Products Rio Viera-Newton keeps in her purse including Trademark Frances Cage Tote, Hydro Flask Water Bottle, Le Specs The Heartbreaker Skinny Cat Eye Sunglasses, Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Invisimatte Blotting Powder and Glossier Balm Dotcom.", "authors": ["Rio Viera-Newton"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/09/05/05-lede-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
