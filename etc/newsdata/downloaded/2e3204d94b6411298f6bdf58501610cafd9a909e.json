(Photo by David K Purdy/Getty Images)\n\nCarson King, a 24-year-old Iowa State fan from Altoona, Iowa, brought a sign to \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d in Ames last Saturday. Nothing fancy, just black marker on white poster board. It read \u201cBusch Light Supply Needs Replenished, Venmo Carson-King-25\u201d.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt was just a funny sign, something that hundreds of fans bring to \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d every week. But after the sign appeared on camera, it turned into so much more. Money started unexpectedly rolling into King\u2019s Venmo account, much more than he thought he\u2019d receive.\n\n\"I looked down at my phone,\u201d King told WHO-TV. \u201cMy friend kept asking 'Hey man, who keeps texting you?' and I looked down and I had about $400 on my Venmo account. I had people from Texas, Idaho, California, Massachusetts, all over. A lot of Clemson people donated. I guess they like Busch Light, too.\"\n\nThe amount kept rising. King had barely put the sign down when the amount reached $1,000, and donations continued to roll in. He told WHO-TV that he called his parents and they hatched a plan: he would keep enough money to pay for a case of beer, but donate the rest to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital in Iowa City.\n\nKing\u2019s mother, Dana Archer-King, had no idea that her son\u2019s stunt would result in such a selfless act.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"He had told me about it last Wednesday and, probably like most moms, I just laughed and thought, 'Great, this will be my proudest moment,' \" Archer-King told the Des Moines Register. But it turned out that it was.\n\n\"He's not a wealthy kid by any means,\" she said. \"I'm not sure how many 24-year-olds would just give that kind of money away. We're all so in awe with what he's doing.\"\n\nKing has raised over $6,000, and plans to keep the fundraiser going until the end of the month when he\u2019ll personally deliver the money to the hospital.\n\n\"This was way better than expected,\" King told the Register. \"It just goes to show that no matter if you\u2019re a Hawkeye fan, Cyclone fan, or Grand View Viking, we\u2019re all Iowans, and Iowans take care of each other.\"\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Carson King never expected to get any donations when his beer money sign appeared on \"College GameDay.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dAJhEoJf03.zNu91R3BRYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TKrdr5aJbiG7UJyQqRC.2Q--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8fdeff60-d953-11e9-81fb-553c6e6b801a", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
