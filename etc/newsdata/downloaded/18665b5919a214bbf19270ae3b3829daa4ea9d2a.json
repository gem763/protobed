The brand employs refugee women to make its jewellery and packaging, giving them training and supporting their household incomes.\n\nMeanwhile, 10% of GBTF\u2019s profits are donated to refugee resettlement agency International Rescue Committee (IRC). So far, the brand has supported women fleeing Bhutan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, El Salvador, Cuba, Honduras and more.\n\nFounded by 29-year-old Daniela Salcedo, her eponymous brand has gained international recognition for handmade jewels.
