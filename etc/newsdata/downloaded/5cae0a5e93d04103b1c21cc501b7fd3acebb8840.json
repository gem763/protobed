More intense dry spells reduce freshwater flowing outward. Adding to the peril, in some places the land is naturally sinking.\n\nAll of this allows seawater to claim new territory, killing trees from the roots up.\n\nRising seas often conjure the threat to faraway, low-lying nations or island-states. But to understand the immediate consequences of some of the most rapid sea-level rise anywhere in the world, stand among the scraggly, dying pines of Dorchester County along the Maryland coast.\n\nChesapeake Bay\u2019s migrating marshes\n\nPeople living on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, the country\u2019s largest estuary system, have a front-row view of the sea\u2019s rapid advance, said Keryn Gedan, a wetland ecologist at George Washington University.\n\nPart of the reason for the quickly rising waters may be that the Gulf Stream, which flows northward up the coast, is slowing down as meltwater from Greenland inhibits its flow. That is causing what some scientists describe as a pileup of water along the East Coast, elevating sea levels locally.\n\nThe effects of climate change are also exacerbated by land that is sinking as a result of geological processes triggered by the end of the last ice age.\n\nBecause of the extraordinary speed at which the water is rising here, Dr. Gedan said, \u201cI think of this area as a window into the future for the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nIn Dorchester County, where dead and dying loblolly pines stand forlornly, Dr. Gedan has learned to \u201cread\u201d these forests from the mix of species present.\n\nAs saltwater moves into the ground, oak and other sensitive hardwoods die first. Loblolly pine, the most salt-tolerant, is often the last tree standing until it, too, is overwhelmed.\n\nThen the saltwater marsh plants move in. If you\u2019re lucky, velvety tufts of cordgrass sprout. If not, impenetrable stands of cane-like Phragmites, an invasive species, take over.\n\nOne reason the effects of rising seas are so noticeable here is that the land has very little slope. Those five millimeters of sea level, a rise that\u2019s only slightly more than two half-dollar coins stacked, can translate into saltwater pushing 15 feet inland per year, according to Dr. Gedan.\n\nShoots of sweet gum, a tree with star-shaped leaves and bark like alligator skin, have more tolerance for salt than other hardwoods, such as oak. They can endure for a time as groundwater becomes more saline.\n\nBut eventually, the sweet gum dies as well.\n\nThe Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, where Dr. Gedan does research, lost 3,000 acres of forest and agricultural land between 1938 and 2006. More than 5,000 acres of marsh became open water.\n\nAt first, this trend depressed Matt Whitbeck, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service who works at the refuge. Saltwater marshes are important nurseries for the fish and crabs people like to eat.\n\nBut in 2012, he realized the marsh wasn\u2019t entirely disappearing; it was migrating. Some of the 3,000 acres of forest that the refuge had lost had transformed into saltwater marsh.\n\nHis outlook changed. \u201cWe need to think about where the marsh is moving, not where it is,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in nearby Smithville, a historically African American town, this movement poses an existential threat. Backyards have been gobbled up by advancing marsh, basketball courts overgrown. What were once thick stands of pine near the water\u2019s edge have greatly thinned.\n\nThe marsh now menaces a historic graveyard.\n\nResidents have battled the advancing wetlands for years, said Roslyn Watts, 60, who grew up here. All that time, she and her neighbors thought the inexorable advance was simply the price of living near water\u2019s edge.\n\nBut in 2010, she learned about global warming and sea level rise, she said. She understood that what was happening wasn\u2019t entirely natural.\n\n\u201cI was angry,\u201d she said, and particularly incensed by the idea that retreat was the only workable strategy. The Dutch didn\u2019t retreat, she said. They built dikes. Why couldn\u2019t Smithville?\n\n\u201cThese families have been here since at least the late 19th century,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection to the land.\u201d\n\nBut Smithville, small and with few resources, has little money to adapt.\n\nFurther south in Somerset County, numerous \u201cfor sale\u201d signs stand in front of houses along the back roads. Some are abandoned, their yards overgrown by Phragmites. On Deal Island, ditches once dug to drain the land for farming and to help manage flooding from high tides now stand full of stagnant water.\n\nToday, in fact, these ditches are part of the threat: Instead of draining water out to sea, they can accelerate the movement of saltwater inland, said Kate Tully, an agroecologist at the University of Maryland.\n\nIn general, saltwater can seep into the soil before sea level rise becomes obvious in other ways, killing sensitive plants far from the shore. \u201cWe call it the invisible flood, because you can\u2019t really see it,\u201d she said.\n\nElizabeth van Dolah, an anthropologist at the University of Maryland who works with rural communities along the eastern shore, noted that residents here are accustomed to marsh migration and flooding. \u201cBut they\u2019re probably seeing it happening at a much quicker pace than in the past,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMany of them recognize that, yes, they eventually have to leave. But for the time being, they intend to stay in place.\u201d\n\nBob Fitzgerald, 80, has farmed near the town Princess Anne his whole life. Driving the back roads in his four-seater pickup, he pointed out fields that, just five years ago, grew corn but have since become too salty for crops.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give property away down here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe asphalt roads are occasionally tinted red along the edges. That, too, is an effect of the floodwater \u201cover-topping\u201d the roads, Mr. Fitzgerald said.\n\n\u201cPeople who have built their homes here are damn fools,\u201d he said, speaking near a place where pine trees appear to be dying around a house. \u201cIt should have been abandoned.\u201d\n\nAs the years pass, he said, it will be.\n\n\u2018Cedar cemeteries\u2019 in New Jersey\n\nFor 33 years, Ken Able has walked the same causeway almost daily at the Rutgers University Marine Field Station in Tuckerton, N.J. In that time he has seen marsh become open water, and the fish population transform as cooler-water species decline and those that thrive in warmer waters move in.\n\nBlue crab and summer flounder, both saltwater species, have pushed into freshwater rivers. Their arrival suggests the waterways are becoming saltier further inland.\n\nAll these signs of change come from the ocean, a fluid and often fickle environment. Which is why Dr. Able, a professor emeritus of marine and coastal sciences, so appreciates the ghost forests. They\u2019re a signal of change from a stationary source: the trees themselves.\n\n\u201cA ghost forest is a way to capture geological history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not always a way to do that.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic white cedar, abundant around the Mullica River Estuary in stands such as this one, is an unusually durable parchment on which to capture that history.\n\nLong prized for lumber, its wood is highly resistant to rot. But the tree is also very sensitive to salt. It can tolerate maybe three salty high tides before succumbing.\n\nSo when the trees begin dying, it\u2019s a trustworthy indicator that conditions are becoming more saline. It is an age-old phenomenon, now happening faster.\n\nErosion of marshes and riverbanks has also accelerated, revealing buried cedar stumps from prehistoric ghost forests. Jennifer Walker, a frequent collaborator with Dr. Able who recently earned her Ph.D. in oceanography at Rutgers, dated one stump here to the fifth century. \u201cCedar cemeteries,\u201d she calls these places.\n\nAs elsewhere, ghost forest formation seems to have sped up recently, particularly after Hurricane Sandy hit the region in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s a good example of a slowly encroaching process \u2014 and then storms making it worse,\u201d Dr. Walker said.\n\nShe is studying sediment cores from salt marshes and dating ancient, dead cedars in order to reconstruct sea level rise and ghost forest formation through time.\n\nThe pace of sea level rise first quickened in the late 19th century after the Industrial Revolution, Dr. Walker said, and then sped up again in recent decades. It\u2019s now rising faster than at any point in the past several thousand years.\n\nMuch of the Mullica River Estuary is a nature preserve, its many tributaries remote and undeveloped. But since 2015, Dr. Able and Dr. Walker have taken a series of helicopter rides over the area. \u201cIt\u2019s not one giant ghost forest,\u201d Dr. Walker said. \u201cBut the more you look, the more you find them.\u201d\n\nFrom above, they\u2019ve seen swaths of dead trees along riverbanks many miles from the open ocean, suggesting that Sandy pushed seawater far up the river system.\n\n\u201cYou get a slug of saltwater,\u201d Dr. Able said, \u201cand things die.\u201d\n\nOn the North Carolina coast, fires and salt\n\nPaul Taillie, a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, encountered a mystery: He wanted to know how quickly ghost forests form. So he repeated a study originally done 15 years earlier to see how plant life had changed over time.\n\nAs expected, saltwater marsh had advanced. Pond pine and other salt-sensitive trees were dying. Salt-tolerant plants, including sawgrass and black needle rush, were moving in.\n\nBut unexpectedly, the change wasn\u2019t occurring evenly across the landscape. Trees were dying faster in some places than others.\n\nWhat could explain this uneven emergence of ghost forests?\n\nThe study area had almost no slope \u2014 much of it was just inches above sea level \u2014 and the minor differences in elevation couldn\u2019t explain the variation.\n\nBut a clue came from the soil. It tended to be saltier where trees were dying fastest.\n\nThe explanation Dr. Taillie, who\u2019s now a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Florida, landed on had to do with drought. When droughts hit, the amount of freshwater emptying into the ocean from nearby rivers declines, making near-shore waters saltier in some places.\n\nThat saltier water then pushes inland unevenly, killing trees in an irregular pattern across an otherwise mostly uniform landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s not just rising sea level\u201d that creates ghost forests, Dr. Tallie said, but periods of dryness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more during times of drought, when you have less freshwater, that the saltwater creeps in,\u201d he said. \u201cSalinity goes up.\u201d\n\nWildfires are another accelerant.\n\nWetlands burn naturally here during dry years. Fires often travel on top of standing water, consuming grass and trees that rise above the muck.\n\nIn the past, young trees quickly sprouted after fires. But recently, some forests have failed to recover.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost no regeneration,\u201d Chris Moorman, a disturbance ecologist at North Carolina State University, said as we surveyed an expanse of dead, mostly branchless trees. He and Dr. Taillie said they think that wetlands like these have become too salty for young pond pines, which are more sensitive to salt than mature ones. They can\u2019t gain a foothold in marshes their own forebears could tolerate.\n\nDrought is predicted to become more frequent as the climate warms, Dr. Taillie said. That means wildfires, combined with intensified dry spells and amplified saltwater intrusion may, together, accelerate the formation of ghost forests independently of sea level rise.\n\nThe synergy of fire and salt produces particularly dramatic ghost forests. Along the Chesapeake Bay, stands of trees might gradually thin near open water, until just a few scraggly pines remain. But in some places here, acre upon acre of dead trees, sun-bleached and occasionally fire-blackened, stand sentinel over bubbling marshes.\n\nYet while the ghost forests may evoke graveyards, the salt marsh plants that advance into dead and dying stands of trees are themselves valuable. Marshes provide homes for birds; they serve as nurseries for young fish and other sea creatures.\n\nAnd as the sea advances, the new marshes also provide a momentary buffer against the rising tide \u2014 protecting the forests whose time has not yet come.", "description": "Along the mid-Atlantic coast, sea levels are rising rapidly, creating stands of dead trees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/climate/cli-ghostforests-diptych/cli-ghostforests-diptych-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
