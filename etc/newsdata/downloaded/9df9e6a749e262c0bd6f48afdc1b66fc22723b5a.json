The Outlook is Stable. IMB's other ratings were also affirmed at the same time.

This should also underpin its asset quality through the cycle. IMB's lending standards are generally in line with other small Australian banks and remain tighter than three years ago, driven partly by increased regulatory oversight. Control frameworks have been strengthened to improve management of reputational and conduct risks, an area which has seen increased scrutiny in the sector. IMB has a stable business model and benefits from its regional focus, which allows the bank to have a stronger brand presence in its local market. However, the small franchise acts as a drag on its rating, and is unlikely to improve significantly in the short-to medium-term despite ongoing merger activity. The bank is a 'price-taker' in its core market of residential mortgages, which is dominated by the four major banks. Fitch expects IMB's asset quality to remain strong over the next two years, supported by the low-interest-rate environment and its underwriting standards. The low level of impaired loans should continue to compare favourably with international peers. Arrears increased slightly over financial year 2019 (FY19, to month/year), but remained at very low levels and are manageable by the bank. A sharp rise in unemployment remains the key downside risk, but this is not Fitch's base case. Fitch believes profitability will remain broadly consistent in FY20. Earnings and profitability growth will be challenged by margin pressure from competition, ongoing investments in digital capabilities, and rising regulatory costs. Fitch also expects the pending merger with Hunter United will increase expenses in the short term during the integration process. IMB's capital levels are in line with its small bank domestic peer group, and the bank maintains a comfortable buffer above the regulatory requirement. The declining CET1 ratio over the last four years reflects the bank's share-buyback activity. We expect IMB's capital ratios to stabilise in FY20, given the bank's growth plans and a more challenging earnings environment. SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS IMB's Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors reflect Fitch's view that while support from the authorities is possible, it cannot be relied upon due to the banks' small market shares and low systemic importance. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR AND VIABILITY RATING IMB's Viability Rating and IDRs are sensitive to any increase in its risk appetite which may be evident from more aggressive underwriting standards or looser risk controls, possibly in an effort to improve the franchise. This may manifest in a larger-than-peer deterioration in asset quality, profitability and capitalisation in a downturn. The bank's funding profile could also be pressured by strong asset growth, which could in turn pressure ratings if not offset through adequate capital and liquidity management. Positive rating action is unlikely, given IMB's modest franchise. SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS IMB's Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors are sensitive to changes in Fitch's assumptions about the propensity or ability of the Australian sovereign (AAA/Stable) to provide timely support.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
