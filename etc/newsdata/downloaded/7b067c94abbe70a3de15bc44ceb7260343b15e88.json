Such is the case this week as the musicians look inward. All good great art inspires and these songs certainly had me humming and thinking.\n\nChe Apalache, \"The Dreamer\"\n\nHere's a first for the Alt.Latino playlist: We already featured this song in mid-August, but we're going to do it again. While I was impressed by the song's very moving, real-life story of a DACA recipient from North Carolina (\"a true son of the South\"), I am moved beyond words by the new video. It's a powerful combination that must shared. \u2014 Felix Contreras\n\nYouTube\n\nLa Santa Cecilia, \"A Thousand Times\"\n\nLa Santa Cecilia's new self-titled release (its first all sung in English) is a hyper-personal album for a band so often focused on the personal-political. \"A Thousand Times\" is another turn inward, and the opening lyric is one that rings true with Latinxs: \"I'm standing on the edge of losing everything I've worked so hard to build.\" A joyful fusion of roots, hip-hop, and norte\u00f1o swirls around La Marisol's crooning of lines like \"I'm hiding out where everybody sees me.\" Those thousand times become a reminder not just of times of sorrow, but times of perseverance. \u2014 Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nYouTube\n\nCombo Chimbita, \"Revelaci\u00f3n (Candela)\"\n\nSeeing Combo Chimbita live is a revelation. Descriptors like psychedelic and hypnotic are appropriate, but only scratch the surface of the Combo Chimbita experience.\n\nThis Bogota by way of Brooklyn quartet has a lot in common with another Colombian electro-cumbia export (Bomba Est\u00e9reo) in the interweaving guitar lines that echo a myriad of Colombia folk rhythms. And in the power of Carolina Oliveros' voice is a guide through the band's levels of musical consciousness. \u2014 Felix Contreras\n\nYouTube\n\nNoa Sainz, \"ya mi mam\u00e1 me dijo que contigo s\u00ed\" & \"pero ahora que lo pienso mejor\"\n\nCDMX-based singer Noa Sainz has blessed us with a miniature song cycle that concerns the ancient tug-of-war between love and doubt. A quiere irse, B no quiere que se vaya begins with \"ya mi mam\u00e1 me dijo que contigo s\u00ed,\" a buoyant '90s-inflected R&B track that celebrates a relationship's simplicity: \"Todo es tan simple contigo me atrevo a decir.\" The B-side walks back this fearlessness as if bracing for that relationship's end: \"No me puedo ir / No me quiero ir / Pero ahora que lo pienso mejor / Me funciona m\u00e1s verte as\u00ed.\" Sainz's voice wavers accordingly over a lush, early-morning beat, making this familiar side of the coin sound so new and right. \u2014 Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nYouTube\n\nJuan Wauters, \"Lonely\"\n\nJuan Wauters has seemingly boundless creativity. He released two albums in 2019; first, La Onda de Pablo, then Introducing Juan Pablo, which he describes as a prequel and companion to the first.\n\n\"Lonely\" is a meditation on being alone vs. being lonely. Unlike some of his past work, this one side steps any influences from his native Uruguay and reflects the melancholy of his long-time home in New York. \u2014 Felix Contreras", "description": "On this week's playlist, Che Apalache, La Santa Cecilia, Combo Chimbita and Noa Sainz all look inward.", "authors": ["Felix Contreras", "Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/24/che-apalache_wide-ca57247f2820c2ab37404cc0152d7e57c17d4484.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
