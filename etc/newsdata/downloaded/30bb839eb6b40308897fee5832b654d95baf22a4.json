The work, created by Swedish sculptor Peter Linde, is impressive. Ibrahimovic stands 1.95m (6ft 5in) tall. The sculpture is 2.7 metres high and weighs 500kg.\n\nIbrahimovic, whose parents emigrated from the former Yugoslavia, grew up in difficult conditions in Rosengard, a neighbourhood in Malmo known for violent clashes between rival gangs.\n\nHe played for Malmo, then Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan, PSG and Manchester United before moving to the LA Galaxy. He developed a reputation as a player who won league titles, collecting 13 in 16 seasons in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France, although one, with Juventus, has since been rescinded.\n\nHis Galaxy team have made the MLS playoffs and face Minnesota in the first round on October 20.\n\nIbrahimovic dominated the Swedish national team from 2001 to 2016, winning 116 caps and scoring 62 goals.\n\nHe remains an icon in his hometown.\n\n\u201cHe is one of us. He comes from Rosengard and has become the king of football,\u201d said Jaafar, who grew up in the area and came up to approach his idol.\n\nIbrahimovic, who is famous for his bombastic, possibly tongue in cheek, declarations, said before leaving PSG that he would stay if the club owners could persuade the city to \u201cchange the Eiffel Tower for my statue\u201d.\n\n\u201cA World Cup without me is nothing to watch, so it is not worth waiting for the World Cup,\u201d he said when Sweden failed to qualify for the 2014 finals.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic unveiled a bronze statue of himself on Tuesday near the stadium where he launched his professional career in his hometown of Malmo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zlatan-ibrahimovic-statue-sweden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
