That\u2019s my opinion since I have known her.\" He then added that he'd only seen her \"by picture.\u201d\n\nThe two countries have been at loggerheads for days. On Friday, ahead of the G7 in Biarritz, Macron called for the burning Amazon to lead the agenda of the summit, and said that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro \"lied to him\" about the Mercosur free-trade agreement between the EU and Latin American countries.\n\nThings then got personal. On Sunday, a Bolsonaro supporter posted a meme mocking the appearance of Brigitte Macron and comparing her unfavourably to Brazil's first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, with the tagline: \"Now you understand why Macron is persecuting Bolsonaro?\"\n\nThe far-right Brazilian leader replied: \"Do not humiliate the guy, ha ha.\"\n\nBolsonaro has also accused Macron of having a \"colonialist mentality.\"\n\nMacron struck back in extraordinarily blunt remarks at the G7 on Monday, saying he hoped that Brazil will soon have a new president. \"I hope they will very soon have a president who is up to the task,\" Macron told reporters. He called the Brazilian's comments about his wife \"extraordinarily rude\" and \"sad.\"\n\nOn the same French TV show, Serra also said that his country rejected an offer for a fund from the G7 members to help fight fires in the Amazon.\n\n\u201cWe refuse because we see interference. [It\u2019s] help we didn\u2019t ask for,\" he said. \"The G7 help was decided without Brazil.\u201d\n\nOnyx Lorenzoni, chief of staff to Bolsonaro, told Globo news website Monday evening that \u201cMacron cannot even avoid a predictable fire in a church that is part of the world\u2019s heritage, and he wants to give us lessons for our country?\u201d He was referencing the fire that hit Notre Dame cathedral in Paris in April.", "description": "Emmanuel Macron and Jair Bolsonaro have been trading barbs for days.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Rym Momtaz", "Hans Von Der Burchard", "David M.
