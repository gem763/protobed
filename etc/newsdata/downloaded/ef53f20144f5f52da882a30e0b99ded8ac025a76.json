We need a much more open conversation about pay at work so that women can know if they are being paid equally and fairly.\u201d\n\nCharlene Cranny, campaigns director at Good Money Week, said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably not a huge shock to anyone reading this that women are still more likely than men to feel awkward broaching the subject of money. Our research suggests that men have no qualms in instigating these conversations with employers more regularly and in turn, they are receiving higher and more regular pay rises, and we feel that it is time to readdress the balance.\n\n\u201cThere are larger structural issues at play for why women are often paid less than men, but there is definitely something to be said for \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Get\u2019. Men are still socialised to \u2018win\u2019 and \u2018provide\u2019 so feel empowered (twice as likely!) and excited about asking for a pay rise.\n\n\u201cThese are seen as very masculine traits which women often reject or differentiate from by seeing the pursuit of money as \u2018icky\u2019, \u2018vulgar\u2019, caring more about their performance and impact. However, research shows that women are much more likely to use their money in ways that have a positive impact on people and the environment. That makes it our duty as women to increase our wealth through deserved pay rises, investments and other available means normally dominated by men.\u201d\n\nThe campaign, which runs from 5 to 11 October is calling for people to approach their employers about issues such as flexible working, shared parental leave and the gender pay gap \u2013 as well as salary rises.", "description": "More than a quarter of women have never requested a pay rise and women are substantially more likely to find the process of doing so \u201cawkward\u201d, a new study has found.
