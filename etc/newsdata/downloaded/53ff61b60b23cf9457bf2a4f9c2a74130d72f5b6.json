Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nLove Sesame Street?\n\nNow you don\u2019t have to go all the way to Universal Studios just to get your (or your kids\u2019) fix of Elmo, Big Bird, and Oscar the Grouch.\n\nA Sesame Street-themed pop-up cafe is opening in Singapore on Thursday (Sept 26) featuring characters from the beloved children\u2019s show.\n\nRead also: THEN AND NOW: The muppets of \u2018Sesame Street\u2019\n\nAfter looking at promotional photos of the adorable food, Business Insider visited the cafe on Tuesday (Sept 24) to see if their meals could satisfy adults as well as kids.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\nSesame Street lovers, listen up: in celebration of its 50th anniversary, a pop-up cafe on the beloved TV series is opening in Singapore from Sep 26 to Dec 29.\n\ncaption It\u2019s located at 8 Jalan Klapa \u2013 just look out for Elmo and the iconic lamp post. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe cafe\u2019s colourful interior is bedecked in custom decor, and features baby versions of popular Sesame Street characters.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe cafe focuses on Big Bird, Elmo, Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, and Abby Cadabby, a newer character introduced in 2006.\n\ncaption Sorry to disappoint fans of Ernie, Bert, Grover, Snuffleupagus, and Count Von Count \u2013 nothing for you here! source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThere was a wall featuring the 50-year anniversary logo.\n\ncaption The other references the opening theme of \u201cElmo\u2019s World\u201d. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nMost of the decor is evidently for kids, but the kitchen cabinets had unexpectedly sophisticated motifs of burgers, cookies, and trash cans.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nYou can buy soft toys, notebooks and pencil cases beside the cashier.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nAlso available are half-skeleton figurines created by Singapore brand MightyJaxx, which a rep said are extremely popular in the US.\n\ncaption Creepy stuff. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nEach table features a different character. Mine had Elmo and Cookie Monster.\n\ncaption Every table also gets a soft toy for cuddling and photo taking. Just don\u2019t take it home. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nAfter going through the menu, I realised enterprising fans can order entire meals featuring just one character.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a possible Big Bird-themed menu:\n\ncaption source Kumoya\n\nHere\u2019s one for Cookie Monster\u2026\n\ncaption source Kumoya\n\nOne for Oscar the Grouch\u2026\n\ncaption source Kumoya\n\n\u2026 and one for Elmo.\n\ncaption Sorry, no Elmo-themed dessert. source Kumoya\n\nFans of Abby Cadabby can get a main and dessert, but no drink.\n\ncaption source Kumoya\n\nAmong the three drinks I order, the standout is the Oscar the Grouch matcha caramel frappe (S$13.90).\n\nApart from a thick layer of matcha mousse on top, the drink below tastes just like cold, refreshing matcha milk.\n\ncaption The Big Bird mango soda (S$15.90) is a tad too sweet, but kids will love the cotton candy. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThose looking for a good deal can get the cookie shot with matcha milk (S$14.90) \u2013 it comes with a free soft toy.\n\ncaption Warning: drink this over a plate, because the milk may leak out of holes in the cookie cup. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nDesigned by Instagram-famous food stylist Shirley Wong, the mains are undeniably photogenic.\n\nBut the heavier options \u2013 curry rice (S$26.90) and cream-sauce rice (S$22.90) \u2013 come in enormous portions, accompanied with mostly deep-fried items, making them hard to finish.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nMy favourite main is the teriyaki chicken burger with curly fries (S$24.90). It comes with matcha buns and a sour sauce that cuts through the crispy chicken katsu.\n\ncaption There\u2019s also a salad cup hidden in the trash can. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThose who want a healthier main can pick the udon.\n\nThe noodles come in a light, salty broth topped with seaweed, fishcakes, corn, broccoli, and a perfectly cooked ramen egg.\n\ncaption Not pictured (but part of the dish) is a side of three fried prawns. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe desserts are equally photogenic, and extremely sweet. Kid diners will be in heaven.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe Cookie Monster chocolate cake (S$18.90) comes with cookies, cotton candy, and heaps of cream.\n\ncaption Small, but suitable for three or four diners to share, given the rich taste. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe rainbow-themed Shibuya toast (S$27.90) has ice cream, cookies, fruit salad, and a lollipop on the side.\n\ncaption Comes with a small pot of chocolate sauce for drizzling over. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe kooky-looking Elmo and Cookie Monster macarons make me laugh.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nInside the toast square is more toast, rainbow marshmallows, and Froot Loops.\n\ncaption This is a very carb-heavy option that four people could easily share. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI also try the mini buttermilk pancakes (S$20.90) with syrup, ice cream, meringue, and cotton candy.\n\nThe dish comes with a sparkler that a server will light up at the table.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI enjoyed the pancakes the best of all, as the portion was manageable and not too rich.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nDon\u2019t want to pay full price for a soft toy? Before leaving, try to catch one for S$2 at a claw machine outside the door.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Now you don't have to go all the way to Universal Studios to get your (or your kids') fix of Elmo, Big Bird, and Cookie Monster..
