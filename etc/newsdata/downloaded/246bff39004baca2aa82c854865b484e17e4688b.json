In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. is preparing to invest in more German financial startups at a time when the industry is seeing a record inflow of money as well as a wave of failures.\n\n\u201cOur investing pipeline in Berlin and Germany as a whole is very strong,\u201d said Rana Yared, a Goldman partner who is also a managing director in the lender\u2019s Principal Strategic Investments group. She declined to name any future targets after the company took stakes in two Berlin-based fintech firms this year.\n\nInvestments in German fintech companies reached a record in 2018, topping 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) for the first time, according to data by Barkow Consulting. After the first six months of this year, investments already stand at around 900 million euros with the first quarter seeing the highest inflows ever. This could point to inflated asset prices, raising the stakes for Goldman.\n\nYared said her team is extremely cautious on valuations, not just in Germany. \u201cIt is an existential challenge for companies if they raise money at a valuation that is too high for where they are,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have the risk of a down-cycle happening and having to raise new money at a lower valuation, which has implications for your employees and their morale, and for clients.\u201d\n\nThe team tends to shy away from companies that are \u201cpre-revenue, pre-product,\u201d Yared added. On average, it keeps the investments for more than five years, she said. \u201cWe invest amounts as small as $10 million and as large as $100 million.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study by PwC, a total of 34 German fintech firms folded in the first five months of this year -- a record for the period. The firm blamed the rise of what it calls \u201cme-too-fintechs,\u201d which had to deal with the fact that some companies in their line of business simply got a head-start on them.\n\nGoldman doesn\u2019t just have its eye on the German capital, Yared said. \u201cDigital banking seems to have a strong center in Berlin,\u201d she said, while \u201cmore capital markets focused fintechs are born in Frankfurt. An ecosystem has developed in both cities, attracting talent.\u201d\n\nIn May, Goldman led a founding round for Berlin-based Elinvar which was founded by former Deutsche Bank AG employees and has built a digital platform to enable lenders to offer their services online. Two month later, it invested 25 million euros in Raisin, an internet platform allowing user to compare bank-savings products.\n\nBerlin-based smartphone bank N26 raised new funds at a valuation of $3.5 billion in July, making the company one of Europe\u2019s highest valued non-listed fintech firms. \u201cWe know N26. We are very impressed with the growth and the stage they are at\u201d, Yared said. \u201cWe do not regret not investing into challenger banks because we view ourselves as a challenger bank.\u201d\n\n(N26 added in last paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Stephan Kahl in Frankfurt at skahl@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Katrin Haertel at khaertel@bloomberg.net, Andrew Blackman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets?
