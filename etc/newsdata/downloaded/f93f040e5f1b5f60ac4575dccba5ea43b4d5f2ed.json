I don\u2019t know if even in the age of round-the-clock social media anybody from the real world could pull off that kind of leap to fame.\n\nBret: It\u2019s a shame because I think the Democratic field has some first-rate talents who could beat Trump, but that the party has just discounted, at least so far: Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, Amy Klobuchar. What is it about them that just doesn\u2019t excite the base?\n\nGail: Think back on the Obama comparison. People used to faint at his rallies, they were so excited. The names you mentioned are all fine people with good ideas, but I wouldn\u2019t call any of them electric.\n\nBret: True, though you have to love Michael Bennet\u2019s latest campaign pledge: \u201cIf you elect me president, I promise you won\u2019t have to think about me for two weeks at a time.\u201d Lord, give me a president like that.\n\nGail: Speaking of, um, electric \u2014 let\u2019s move on to shocking. Which do you think will hurt Trump more, the fact that he played golf while Americans were being threatened by a terrible hurricane or the fact that he doctored the weather map to make it look as if he was actually right about the storm going to Alabama?\n\nBret: Remember when he used to slam President Obama for playing too much golf? Go on \u2026.\n\nGail: Both of those worry me more than his much larger recent bad decisions because they go beyond bad judgment to a kind of egomaniacal delusion. Where\u2019s the most obscure dictatorship in the world? I\u2019ll bet even there the head man wouldn\u2019t go on TV to show the country a map that looked like it had been doctored by an overreaching third-grade-geography student.\n\nIs it too much to wish for a president who\u2019s at least capable of competent forgery?\n\nBret: You know, if you squint hard, the Trump presidency could be a darkly comic TV show: Imagine \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d but with Steve Martin or Rowan Atkinson in the role of President Underwood. Alternatively, perhaps the more accurate comparison might be to the sequel to the Stephen King horror flick, \u201cIt Chapter Two.\u201d", "description": "But does she have Trump\u2019s number?
