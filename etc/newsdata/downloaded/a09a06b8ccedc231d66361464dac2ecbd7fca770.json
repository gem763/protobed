The caveat emptor or buyer beware principle that underpins property transactions puts the onus on the buyer to find problems.\n\nThorough due diligence on a subject property can often reveal a defect. That is why it is vital to undertake building and pest inspections where possible and always have contract documents checked by an experienced conveyancer well before making an offer on any property.\n\nTrap for young players\n\nThe second type of lemon is the mistyped. The property is structurally sound and well maintained. Yet it is a lemon because it does not have the attributes of an investment property. It\u2019ll make someone a nice home but won\u2019t deliver a sufficient financial return.\n\nToo often, novice investors don\u2019t think to test for the mistyped, committing to a property once they are satisfied there is no defect. And it is true that the mistyped property can be harder to spot than the defect. The answer lies in the abstract world of spreadsheets and valuations. Nuanced judgments must be made about whether the property will out- or underperform. Evidence must be gathered on its history and that of similar properties and about the balance between supply and demand of that property type in that location from a rental and purchase perspective.\n\nTime is the buyer\u2019s friend for weeding out the defect and the mistyped. Properties with a track record tend to reveal their secrets eventually, be it physical flaws or irregularities in paperwork. For instance, a property that has a history of selling comparatively cheaply indicates that many others have rejected it in the past, so is a flag to dig deeper.\n\nBy contrast, it\u2019s far harder to assess a recently built property, be it a high-rise apartment, a townhouse, a freestanding house or off-the-plan. Sure, new properties come with warranties, but claiming on them is a world of pain. Smart investors will apply a significant uncertainty discount on any new property. That\u2019s tough on a developer whose product may well be defect-free. But temper your sympathy: they usually have the consolation that there will be plenty of others who mistakenly pay a premium for the new and shiny.\n\nwakelin.com.au", "description": "Spotting the flaws will avoid a costly mistake from which you could take years to recover.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6485%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_63/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/10aa02c952ee95d78635536e1a7a732b8b3f885d", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
