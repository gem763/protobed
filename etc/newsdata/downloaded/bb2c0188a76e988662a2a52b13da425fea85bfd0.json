(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nAn Iranian Instagram star who gained recognition for her resemblance to actress Angelina Jolie through cosmetic surgery was arrested Saturday and charged with a variety of crimes, according to Agence France-Presse, which cited Iran\u2019s semiofficial Tasnim news agency.\n\nFatemeh Kh, known as Sahar Tabar, was arrested on charges of blasphemy, promoting violence, illicit education, insulting the Islamic veil, spreading hatred and encouraging youths to commit corruption, according to CNN. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance ordered the arrest, AFP reported.\n\nSahar Tabar has been arrested in Tehran. pic.twitter.com/lziXDgmGBj \u2014 Hossein Ghazanfari (@TehranDC) October 5, 2019\n\nTabar\u2019s posts caused an online stir last year when her Instagram account displayed her distorted features and ghoulish makeup choices. Her appearance drew comparisons to the character in Tim Burton\u2019s stop-motion movie \u201cCorpse Bride.\u201d\n\nTabar told Russian government-owned news site Sputnik in 2017 that it wasn\u2019t her goal to look like Jolie or the animated character in the Burton movie, saying she was her own muse. She said she had had plastic surgery on her nose and lips, in addition to liposuction. Her photos, she said, were a form of art, in which she can play with makeup and photo editing.\n\n\u201cFor me the most important thing is to have the acceptance of my family and God. I have those and that is enough for me,\u201d she said then. \u201cOpinions from the rest of the world are not important, I ignore their negativity.\u201d\n\nThe opinion of Iranian law, however, could have very serious consequences.\n\nThe crime of blasphemy covers a wide range of acts that the state disapproves of. The punishment could be a few months in jail or even death, which is often accompanied by torture, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs.\n\nThe penalty for not wearing the hijab, the Islamic headscarf, also could result in a lengthy sentence. In August, prison sentences ranging from 16 years to nearly 24 years were handed out to three women who in March publicly protested wearing hijabs.\n\nExperts say fear and hypocrisy drive the Iranian government\u2019s actions against Tabar.\n\nTabar\u2019s arrest is nothing unique, said Masih Alinejad, a women\u2019s rights activist who started a social media movement called #whitewednesday, in which Iranian women post images of themselves without their hair covered.\n\n\u201cThe government focuses on all of those influencers on Instagram who have followers,\u201d Alinejad said. \u201cThey try to control them.\u201d\n\nDrawing attention in the West, like Tabar did, can especially place someone on the government\u2019s radar, said Alireza Nader, founder and chief executive of New Iran Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on research and analysis of Iran.\n\nNader said Tabar could face jail time or lashings for her actions.\n\nThe government could also coerce her into issuing a public apology for her posts, as it did last year when a teen posted a video of herself dancing without her hijab on Instagram to her audience of more than 600,000, Alinejad said. Some Iranian women uploaded clips of themselves dancing in solidarity after her arrest.\n\nTeenage dancer, Maedeh Hojabri, was arrested in Iran. She used to record dance videos in her bedroom and upload them to her instagram with 600K followers.#\u0645\u0627\u0626\u062f\u0647_\u0647\u0698\u0628\u0631\u0649 pic.twitter.com/3EDVR9veV3 \u2014 Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) July 8, 2018\n\nThe head of Tehran\u2019s cyber police said at the time that his staff would identify popular Instagram accounts and act against them, according to the Guardian.\n\nSince her arrest, Tabar\u2019s Instagram account has been deleted. Many of her photos are available on another account, although it\u2019s unclear who runs it.\n\nIn July 2018, Iran arrested 46 people for \u201cdamaging public virtue through the organized spreading of anti-cultural\u201d activities through their Instagram accounts, according to the Associated Press.\n\nSocial media platforms Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Telegraph are banned in the country, according to Amnesty International, but Instagram is not.\n\nThe Telegraph reported in January that Iran had moved to ban Instagram, but it was unclear when such a ban would take effect.\n\nThe impact of social media is something the Iranian government is paying attention to amid internal unrest, Nader said.\n\n\u201cSocial media reaches so many Iranians and is considered threatening to the regime,\u201d he said, noting that social media platforms have been used for civil disobedience and human rights advocacy.\n\nBut Nader also noted, \u201cIf they shut it down, they shut down their own means of communication.\u201d Most Iranian officials have social media accounts. The president of Iran has more than 2 million followers on his Instagram page, where he has nearly 1,100 posts.\n\nNader says there\u2019s no rhyme or reason as to whom the government targets, but Alinejad said they are usually women \u2014 people the government really wants to control, she said.\n\nIn July, the head of the Tehran Revolutionary Court warned that people who film themselves, post under the \u201cwhite Wednesday\u201d hashtag and send their images to Alinejad could face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe action sparked another hashtag: #mycameraismyweapon.\n\n\u201cThese women know the risk, but they think this is the time,\u201d Alinejad said of Iranian women turning to social media in their fight for equality. \u201cThey are fed up with the recent interference in their personal lives. They want to be free. They\u2019re ready to pay the price.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThere are two types of hijabs.
