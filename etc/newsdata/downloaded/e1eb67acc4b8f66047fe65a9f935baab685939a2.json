It was reopened a year later when the Association of Christian Lawyers brought a civil action for \u201ccrimes against religious sentiment\u201d and \u201cmocking Catholic symbols and dogma\u201d.\n\nThe lawyers\u2019 association also claimed the women wore hoods in the manner of penitents and chanted \u201cthe Virgin would also have had an abortion\u201d, as well as parodies of the Credo, the Christian liturgy, and \u201cthe immutable truths behind the Catholic faith\u201d.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said the point of the procession was not to offend religious sensibilities but to \u201cdefend social, workers\u2019 and feminist rights.\u201d\n\nMaria Alyokhina, a founding member of the Russian feminist group Pussy Riot, joined the Andalusian Human Rights Association and other groups protesting outside the court against the attempted prosecution, which they denounced as \u201can affront to freedom of speech\u201d and the \u201ccriminalisation of social movements\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe case is totally unjust and bears many similarities to the repression in Russia,\u201d Alyokhina said, adding: \u201cAfter all, we all come out of a vagina.\u201d\n\nIn 2012 Alyokhina, better known as Masha, was condemned to two years in Siberia after Pussy Riot staged a performance at a Moscow cathedral that was critical of Vladimir Putin.", "description": "Parade aimed to defend rights rather than offend religious sensibilities, judge says", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39f86f8e004326eaba17533cdaed1b90147037a3/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c732fb11937996447fe4dfd69fb0e85", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
