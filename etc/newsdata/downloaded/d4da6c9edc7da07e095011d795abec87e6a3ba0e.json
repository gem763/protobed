He says the programme significantly improves Ukrainian SMEs access to finance.\n\n\"Today only 6 percent of Ukrainian SME's have access to finance, which is extremely low. Due to the European Investment Bank programme, we can triple this figure. This is really vital for the Ukrainian economy.\"\n\nPolissia-2002 is one Ukrainian company that has benefited from the new financial initiative.\n\nFounded in 2014, it is a rapidly growing SME specialised in the export of pine timber. The company's average output is around 2000 cubic square metres of pine board per month. Recently, Polissia-2002 was able to obtain two loans totalling one million euros from Raiffeisen Bank Aval, through the credit guarantee provided by the EIB.\n\nCo-owner Yaroslav Bayev says the money was vital in terms of buying new equipment, such as wood drying kilns manufactured in Italy.\n\n\"With these loans, our company had the opportunity to reach a completely new level, so we built the new warehouse where we are standing right now; we built up and set up additional kiln dryers and we set up a new cutting line.\u201d\n\nThe new kilns have enabled Polissia to dry around 1500 cubic square metres of pine board per month. That means, today, 90 percent of the firm's production is exported, most of which is sent to the EU, Asia and the Middle East.\n\n\u201cNowadays, competition worldwide is very high. In this case, the company had to develop very rapidly. With this (financial) help, we\u2019ve been able to reach a new level,\u2019\u2019 Bayev says.\n\nThe guarantee, which covers up to 70 percent losses on individual SME loans, enables the EIB to significantly improve access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises in Ukraine.\n\nThe programme also allows the Ukrainian lenders taking part in the programme to offer improved loan terms to SMEs, particularly in the form of reduced collateral requirements.\n\n\"In terms of the programme we finance SMEs with a transparent and healthy business model, which may lack the collateral. We are aiming to support local producers with an innovative and export-related strategy,\" Spivak says.\n\nIn addition to Raiffeisen Bank Aval, three other banks in Ukraine are involved in the EIB initiative providing loans to SMEs in local currency.\n\nThe loan guarantee programme is the centrepiece of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) Initiative East, a European Union initiative that aims to support countries in Eastern Europe which have signed an Association Agreement with the EU - notably Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.", "description": "This episode of Business Planet goes to Ukraine to see how loan guarantees from the European Union are helping small and medium-sized businesses to thrive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/44/76/52/1000x563_cmsv2_4636bd61-bcdb-58ca-ab21-8be4ff8ebd41-3447652.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-01"}
