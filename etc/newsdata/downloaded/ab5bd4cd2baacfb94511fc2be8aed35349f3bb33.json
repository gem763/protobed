The speech earned him a standing ovation and positive headlines over the holiday weekend.\n\nWhile the content of Sanders\u2019s speech appeared to hit the right notes and impress the 6,000-plus who packed the auditorium, the disturbing reality remains that he and Castro were the only two available options to attendees. Part of the low participation, as many campaigns will claim, can be blamed on the nature of the campaign schedule. But there\u2019s also a larger trend at play.\n\nThe Muslim Collective for Equitable Democracy conference, organized by the Muslim Caucus, was held in late July in Washington, D.C. Despite Congress still being in session, only Mayor Bill de Blasio showed up to the two-day forum. Senator Elizabeth Warren reportedly joined via livestream and Sanders, along with senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, sent a prerecorded video message.\n\n\n\nOne week later, on the second day of the presidential debates in Detroit, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez met with local Muslim leaders at a mosque, purportedly to engage with them in conversation about what their communities need most from the national party. At the event, Perez admitted, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d and then proceeded to do very little work at all, according to those in attendance: Rather than engage them in discussion about what the Democratic Party could do for them, local organizers reportedly complained to one of the co-organizers, Perez simply listened to the concerns voiced to him, smiled, and left.\n\n\n\nBetween the first two Democratic debates this summer, just two minutes were allotted to discussing the Trump Administration\u2019s travel ban on five Muslim-majority countries. This, after Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have been the targets of repeated verbal attacks from the president, culminating in the now-infamous \u201cSend her back,\u201d chant at a July rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. The American Muslim legislators have been forced to regularly deal with death threats, and hate crimes have steadily increased since Trump\u2019s election. Democratic leadership\u2019s defense of their fellow party members has been tepid, at best, considering the severity of the threats.\n\nLama Alzuhd, vice chair of the Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action Michigan, told MSNBC in August that the inaction has come to symbolize what political leaders in the community have noticed as a long trend of hollow offerings from a party that claims to defend them but then shrinks from the task when the opportunity arises.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where if we don\u2019t hear enough support for Rashida [Tlaib] and for Ilhan [Omar], people are going to stay at home,\u201d Alzuhd told MSNBC. \u201cWe finally got people who look like us, who sound like us, who pray like us, who speak to our issues, who connect with us, on the ballot and in office, and yet we are receiving no support.\u201d\n\nThe reason for the silence is complicated to combat but simple to name: Fearful of being painted as anti-Semitic in bad-faith attack ads by the GOP, national Democratic Party leaders are having a difficult time deciding how big of a demographic tent they want to build. Despite this trepidation from the only party they can realistically participate in, American Muslim politicians have fought for and earned seats in the land\u2019s highest legislative body, while American Muslim voters have established themselves as a key voting bloc in several battleground states. According to Emgage, Muslim voters in Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Virginia\u2014all important swing states\u2014turned out for the 2018 midterms at a rate 25 percent above their 2014 numbers.\n\nThe problem for American Muslims isn\u2019t one of being able to assert themselves in the nation\u2019s political system. They\u2019ve successfully accomplished that without the establishment\u2019s help and will continue to do so. The issue arises in trying to convince those at the DNC to relax into the new era, even if only fractionally, and give their communities not just lip service, but actual consideration.\n\nGiven the alternative on the 2020 ballot, Democrats may feel that they have this group\u2019s vote locked up. But as Clinton and Perez found out in 2016, political loyalty is a two-way street, and demanding it without offering anything in return only works for so long.", "description": "Candidates have been cautious when it comes to openly courting American Muslim voters.
