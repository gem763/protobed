When a Cambridge-trained lawyer named William Walker arrived in 1963, he described the place as having \u201ccows wandering through Georgetown, only one bank, only one paved road, and no telephones\u201d. The population was just over 8000, and the mangrove-covered island was swarming with mosquitoes.\n\nThe banks moved in first, then the accounting and law firms. Seven Mile Beach, previously undeveloped, became an international tourist attraction for both divers and money managers. By the end of the 1990s, the jurisdiction had established itself firmly as a leading global banking centre, and today financial services accounts for over half of its economy.\n\nJames Whittaker: \"Even if hurricanes don\u2019t get any more prevalent, they\u2019ll get stronger.\u201d The New York Times\n\nProponents of the Cayman business model argue that its benefits accrue to all of the islands\u2019 citizens, who can boast of having one of the highest gross domestic products per capita in the world. Foreign capital, much of it in the form of duties and fees, helps fund schools and infrastructure. Regulations direct employers to give special consideration to Caymanians for jobs and require that Caymanians own shares in local businesses. But many islanders complain of a two-tiered system. Caymanians get jobs, but are then passed over for promotions. The best-paid positions often go to highly educated expatriates, who make up just under half the resident population of about 66,000.\n\n\u201cThey say this is a trickle-down economy,\u201d said Roy Bodden, a historian of the Cayman Islands and former member of the Legislative Assembly. \u201cSo, here\u2019s my argument. Why should it be a trickle for us? Why aren\u2019t we holding the cup?\u201d Mr Bodden has been a vocal critic of the islands\u2019 unchecked development and what he sees as the disenfranchisement of the island population. \u201cYou talk about the American dream, well, we had a Caymanian dream,\u201d he said. The way he told the story, the elites had sold the country out.\n\nOne vision of Cayman's future: an upscale tax domicile and tourist attraction for the global ultra-wealthy. The New York Times\n\nWhen Kenneth Dart relocated to Grand Cayman, his secretiveness and colourful business dealings aroused local suspicion. In 1993, his home in Sarasota, Florida, burned to the ground in an arson that was never fully explained. After Mr Dart renounced his ties to America a few months later, he moved first to Belize, whose government in 1995 proposed to the State Department a Belizean consulate in Sarasota, where Mr Dart and his family could live, presumably tax-free. The idea was never seriously considered, and Mr Dart settled on Grand Cayman.\n\nIt is a closely guarded secret how much of the three-island territory \u2014 Little Cayman and Cayman Brac hover just to the north-east of the big island \u2014 Mr Dart and his subsidiaries own. Many islanders take it for granted that he is the biggest private landholder on the islands, and some suspect he owns more land than the government. (A spokeswoman for Dart Enterprises said the company would not comment on its investment decisions.)\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the Cayman economy contracted. But Mr Dart picked up the slack. In addition to resorts, office buildings and residential properties, his company began planning and building big municipal infrastructure projects like tunnels and roads, reinvigorating long-held concerns on Grand Cayman that Mr Dart and his subsidiaries controlled too much of the island. A 2015 audit of the government\u2019s land management scolded ministers for allowing Dart subsidiaries such free rein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn audacious plan for Mount Trashmore\n\nSome speculate Mr Dart is private because he fears for his safety. As the scion of a Michigan family business, Dart Container, that has long dominated the polystyrene foam market (it also makes plastic Solo cups and other iconic food service products), Mr Dart was born into a significant fortune. But he also had a talent for trading, making lucrative investments over the decades in financial firms, biotech companies, Russian public vouchers and steeply discounted sovereign debt in Greece and Argentina, among many other companies and countries. Some investments made him enemies. His yacht was armoured to withstand torpedo fire, one of his two brothers, Tom, told Bloomberg News in 1995. When he first moved to the islands, he could be seen flanked by bodyguards.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Dart stepped down as president of his family\u2019s container business and has, according to comments made in 2015 by Dart Enterprises chief executive Mark VanDevelde, become more focused on real-estate development and conservation. He also oversees an extensive nursery on the island, where he collects native and endemic trees and plants.\n\nAccording to materials shared or published by Dart Enterprises, the company has invested more than $US1.5 billion in the Cayman Islands and a further $US1 billion is in the development pipeline. This does not include the estimated price tag for the skyscraper. Bloomberg puts Mr Dart\u2019s net worth at $US5.8 billion. \u201cThey\u2019ll tell you they have \u2018patient capital\u2019,\u201d Mr Whittaker said. \u201cThat\u2019s the word they like to use. Which means \u2018I\u2019m going to throw two, three billion dollars in the ground and my kids or my grandkids will reap the rewards once it gets built.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMount Trashmore\u201d, an eight-story dump, contains almost every piece of garbage discarded on Grand Cayman since it went all-in on financial services in the 1960s. The New York Times\n\nMr Dart\u2019s vision for Cayman is comprehensive. In a 2018 video presented at the local Chamber of Commerce, his company outlined a building program that would connect the white sands of Seven Mile Beach to a protected bay known as the North Sound, incorporating extensive landscaped pedestrian parks and revamped roadways \u2014 in effect, designing a whole town. It would include big new residential developments and offices, in addition to yet another five-star resort on a stretch of beach that abuts the billionaire\u2019s residence.\n\nThe plans reminded me of a game of Monopoly \u2014 if a player bought all of the fanciest properties and packed them with houses and hotels for money managers. When I went to the island, I made an effort to book one of the few Seven Mile Beach hotels that Mr Dart doesn\u2019t own; half way through my stay, I read an announcement in the local paper that he had bought it.\n\nImprobably enough, Mr Dart\u2019s most audacious investment involves Mount Trashmore. Haphazardly established in the 1960s, the massive garbage pile was never trenched or lined, and no one knows what might be leaking from the dump into the ground. Parts of the mountain sometimes spontaneously combust, requiring evacuation of local businesses and a nearby Dart-developed private school.\n\nSince Mr Dart started building on Grand Cayman, the dump has been an obstacle, impeding new development. His company has proposed to cap Mount Trashmore and build a new waste-to-energy facility to dispose of future garbage, which it would manage for the next 25 years, at an estimated cost of nearly half a billion dollars.\n\nThe arrangement \u2014 the heir to a disposable-cup fortune offering to clean up an entire country\u2019s garbage \u2014 seemed remarkable to me, but the Caymanians I spoke with didn\u2019t bat an eye. Except when the stink wafted down the mountain; then they batted their eyes a lot, because they were watering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRisks of a meown\n\nFor three weeks before arriving on the island, I corresponded with a Dart company spokeswoman, who made it cordially clear that an interview with Mr Dart was a non-starter. At one point, she offered to consider written questions and present them to Dart executives. I asked what Mr Dart saw from a real-estate perspective in Cayman. \u201cNot everyone who moves to a place they love invests in it so heavily,\u201d I wrote. I also asked about the dump and the risks of global warming. As far as I knew, Mr Dart was neither a climate sceptic nor a denier, and yet he continued to acquire significant parcels of a country that was, topographically speaking, one of the most vulnerable on earth.\n\nNick Robson, the founder of the Cayman Institute, a nonprofit organisation that has advocated better long-term planning on the island, says Cayman is nowhere near prepared for rising seas and extreme weather. We met on the terrace at a Westin resort, which, like many developments on Seven Mile Beach, is on an elevated concrete slab. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said, predicted that sea levels would rise by roughly one metre by the end of the century.\n\nMr Dart\u2019s Cayman acquisitions call to mind a game of Monopoly \u2014 if a player bought all of the fanciest properties and packed them with houses and hotels for money managers. The New York Times\n\nSome people minimise the risk, he said: \u201c\u2018Well, OK, that\u2019s three-and-a-quarter feet. Oh, no big thing.\u2019 Sorry, we\u2019re seven feet above sea level, for the most part. That\u2019s half way up! When you model a hurricane with storm surge, you can have 15 feet of storm surge, and then you\u2019re looking at 18\u00bd feet above normal sea level.\u201d (None of the many elected officials I contacted would agree to be interviewed on the record, but Suzette Ebanks, the chief information officer, sent a three-page response to written questions that highlighted several initiatives, including \u201cenvironmental impact assessments for major capital projects\u201d and a focus on transitioning to renewable energy.)\n\nMr Robson said he also worried that Cayman\u2019s economic reliance on financial services wasn\u2019t sustainable. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a post-colonial dispensation,\u201d he said, describing the sometimes uneasy relationship that has always existed between Cayman, Britain and the international community.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the political will to reform systems that facilitate tax avoidance reached a high. In 2010, the United States passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires foreign financial institutions to identify American citizens who are account holders and report that to the Treasury. Since 2013, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has been creating an international framework that aims to reduce corporate tax avoidance, particularly for large multinational and internet-based firms.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain has promised to adopt a set of stringent European Union policies designed to combat money laundering and terrorism. If fully implemented, protectorates like Cayman would be expected to create public registers of company owners and provide access to the names of the beneficiaries of trusts. The registers could be accessible not only to law enforcement but also to those with \u201clegitimate interest\u201d, including investigative journalists and non-governmental organisations. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the wind now is potentially existential for the financial services industry in Cayman,\u201d said Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, a watchdog group. \u201cI think it does start to look like it could be a perfect storm for Cayman.\u201d\n\nIf the colonial period was Cayman\u2019s opening act, and financial services its middle, it seemed to me that Mr Dart was quietly preparing for Cayman\u2019s possible finale: as an upscale tax domicile and tourist attraction for the global ultra-wealthy who could afford to come and go from an existentially imperiled island.\n\nJustin Howe, a Dart group executive vice president, talked up the proposed skyscraper\u2019s benefits at a recent economic forum. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to bring in more high net worth, ultrahigh net worth, potentially even more billionaires,\u201d he said during a question-and-answer session. \u201cThey take virtually nothing out of the economy and they put massive amounts into the economy, so we think that\u2019s what a five-, five-plus-star resort has the potential to do.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to build the tower set back from Seven Mile Beach, in the middle of the Camana Bay development. Whatever might happen with international tax legislation or volatile financial markets, the building would be a hedge of sorts, positioned to bring in capital and withstand the rising ocean.\n\n\u201cIs everything he does great? I won\u2019t say everything he does is great,\u201d Mr Whittaker said of Mr Dart, after showing me a map of Hurricane Ivan\u2019s devastation. \u201cI think in overall net benefit, yes, he\u2019s been a net benefit to the island. We need to get one or two more like him, and we\u2019ll be insulated from world shocks.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The New York Times", "description": "The heir to a foam-cup fortune is believed to own more land than anyone on the storied tax haven of Grand Cayman, just as rising seas threaten to engulf it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.775%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1%2C$y_539/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ad6154f6f9d1ea3c9f22115f7de2020d177eca87", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
