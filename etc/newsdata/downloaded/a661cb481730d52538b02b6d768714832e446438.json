The current October record high is 96, set in 1941.\n\nUnder wall-to-wall sunshine, temperatures headed into the mid- and upper 80s this afternoon. That\u2019s already well above normal for the date, given averages that are now in the mid-70s, but we\u2019ve only just begun with this heat spell. Wednesday could be absurd for so late in the year.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Humidity is on the moderate side and rising on a south wind. This added moisture will help keep temperatures from falling too far. Under starry skies, lows will be mainly in the upper 60s to mid-70s. Winds will be from the south around 5 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Wednesday): The heat will crank up to midsummer levels. Let\u2019s start with silver linings: lots of sun and only moderate humidity. Those are about the only ones I can think of. Record-breaking highs headed toward the mid-90s most spots will feel like 100 to 105 degrees or so at peak. Remember, we need a 96-degree reading to tie the all-time October number in the city. Some spots should even try for the upper 90s, although let\u2019s hope it\u2019s isolated if so. Winds will be out of the southwest at around 10 mph.\n\nSee Matt Rogers\u2019s forecast through the weekend.
