One of the children became visibly emotional during the encounter, and, at several points, hurled epithets.\n\nDominick Lobifaro, from Brooklyn, recorded the incident on his cellphone on Oct. 20. The footage shows a group of children, seemingly led by a grown man, confronting Lobifaro as he waited in his car. At one point, one child tearfully asks, \u201cWhat did the f---ing deer do to you?\u201d\n\nVEGAN MARRIED TO HUNTER OPENS UP ABOUT LIFESTYLE, RULES FOR HAPPY MARRIAGE: 'PEOPLE THINK IT'S REALLY FAR OUT'\n\nLobifaro posted the footage to his YouTube page, where he explained what led to the incident.\n\n\"I went hunting Sunday afternoon at a new spot; I called DEC (New York's Department of Environmental Conservation) last year to make sure it was legal to hunt,\" he said. \"I got out of the truck in camo and was immediately attacked by this guy in the yellow shirt. I was not videoing at the time [and] he basically told me there\u2019s no hunting allowed here and he was called the cops. I told him no problem I\u2019m calling DEC and I sat in my car and did that. [Ten] minutes later. he came outside while we were waiting for DEC and the local police. I then started the video. Before the video started the kids were just playing they had no clue about anything. The guy in yellow came out and told them I\u2019m gonna kill all the deer.\"\n\nIn Lobifaro's footage, the man can be seen approaching Lobifaro\u2019s car and asking, \u201cHey, the kids want to know, why you wanna kill deer?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nLobifaro responds, \u201cBecause I eat them.\u201d He then tries telling the children about factory farms, in an attempt to explain how hunting how can be more humane, but one of the upset children cuts him off.\n\nAt multiple points during the footage, the unidentified man in yellow shirt sarcastically calls Lobifaro a \u201chero\u201d in Long Island for making a bunch of children cry. Lobifaro responds, telling the man that he needs to explain to the kids that hunting is a \u201cpart of life.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLobifaro called New York\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation in an attempt to end the situation, the New York Post reports.
