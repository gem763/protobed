But The Post\u2019s reporting adds yet another layer to a growing portrait of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would politically benefit Trump ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nAt the same time that the US withdrew its recommendation to restore certain trade privileges to Ukraine, the president and his allies were also engaged in a shadow foreign-policy campaign that involved stalling a nearly $400 million military-aid package to Ukraine. Bill Taylor, the US\u2019s chief envoy to Ukraine, testified to Congress this week that the decision to freeze aid was part of Trump\u2019s effort to force Zelensky to cave to his demands for investigations.\n\nThe Post\u2019s reporting indicates that the pressure campaign may have extended to more than just the security assistance.\n\nTaylor was one of nearly a dozen current and former government officials who testified as part of Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry examining whether Trump used his public office for private gain.\n\nA career foreign-service officer and war veteran, Taylor gave the most damning testimony to date against the president, directly implicating him for ordering the US to freeze military aid unless Zelensky acceded to his demands.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony also appears to be at odds with what Gordon Sondland, the US\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, told lawmakers last week, and at least one House Democrat said it could open Sondland up to a perjury charge.\n\nTaylor testified that shortly after he became the US\u2019s acting ambassador to Ukraine in June, he realized there were two channels through which US policy toward Ukraine was conducted: an official one, which was spearheaded by Taylor, and an unofficial one, led by Sondland, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and the US\u2019s Special Representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\nThe official channel was focused on longstanding US goals vis-a-vis Ukraine, like fending off Russian aggression and combatting widespread corruption within the country. But the unofficial channel, Taylor said, appeared to zero in on one key objective: getting Ukraine to help Trump\u2019s personal political motivations.\n\nTaylor went on to detail how he learned \u2013 and how officials told him \u2013 Trump not only held up military aid to Ukraine, but also refused to meet with Zelensky at the White House, until Zelensky publicly pledged to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nTaylor also recalled a conversation with Sondland that took place on September 1, in which Sondland told him \u201ceverything\u201d was dependent on Zelensky launching those investigations, including security assistance.\n\nSondland continued and told Taylor Trump wanted Zelensky \u201cin a public box\u201d by putting out a statement in an interview on American television announcing the investigations.\n\nThe conversation between Taylor and Sondland took place days after the US withdrew its recommendation to restore certain trade privileges to Ukraine, and The Post\u2019s reporting raises new questions about what Sondland meant when he allegedly said \u201ceverything\u201d depended on Zelensky making a public statement ordering the investigations Trump wanted.\n\nIt will also likely open new investigative avenues for House Democrats as they conduct their broadening impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conduct. Republican lawmakers have criticized Democrats for holding the hearings behind closed doors, but legal scholars say Democrats are following protocol by gathering information and witness testimony, and that public hearings will come down the road.", "description": "Business Insider - John Bolton told the US's trade representative that that Trump would likely oppose any policy that benefited Ukraine's newly elected government..
