Jasmin is none the wiser - bouncing Jazlyn on her knee.\n\nJoshua then pulls off the towel to reveal their baby's new skinhead look - and Jasmin's jaw drops.\n\nShe begins screaming while Joshua is heard laughing.\n\n(Image: Storyful)\n\n(Image: Storyful)\n\nJasmin says: \"That's not funny. Why is she bald? Joshua, that's not funny.\"\n\nHowever, Mail Online reports that it is actually a custom in Mexican families to shave the head of young children.\n\nThis is so it \"can grow thicker and nicer,\" Jasmin said.\n\nJasmin and Joshua had discussed whether they should do it - but it seems he decided to go ahead without telling her.\n\n(Image: Storyful)\n\n(Image: @jasmin_valero/Twitter)\n\nJasmin said: \"My daughter\u2019s father and I had agreed we were not going to do that until that day where I had asked him if he can watch her so I can sleep in a bit longer and he woke me up with that surprise.\n\n\"I was heartbroken because my baby went from a full head of hair to none at all, but as you can see she was not bothered one bit. Always such a happy baby.\"\n\nShe added: \"The one time I ask him to watch her...\"\n\nPeople watching the video online had a lot to say about the prank.\n\nOne wrote: \"This wasn\u2019t funny, this is child abuse,\" while another said: \"This is the type of thing men do so they are never again given the responsibility of taking care of their own child. Don't fall for it.\"", "description": "Viral footage shows the shocked mother in tears at her partner's 'prank' - and some have branded it 'child abuse'", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Storyful", "Jasmin_Valero Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554285.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jasmin-Aileen-Valero.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
