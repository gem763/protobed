Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. \u2013 amid an escalating battle over a rally Trump plans to hold at the city\u2019s Target Center arena this Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has threatened to sue AEG, the company that manages the arena, after Minneapolis city officials charged a stunning $530,000 for rally security, which the Target Center said the campaign must pay if they still want to use the venue.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS' LIBERAL MAYOR TRYING TO 'BULLY' PRESIDENT TRUMP OUT OF MINNESOTA, SAYS HEAD OF POLICE UNION\n\nTrump signaled Tuesday morning he still plans to show up, tweeting: \"Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can\u2019t price out Free Speech. Probably illegal! I stand strongly & proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night!\"\n\nHe tweeted earlier that the \u201clightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\u201d\n\nThe reference to police may have to do with a recent ban against officers wearing their uniforms while supporting candidates at events or in advertisements. Lt. Bob Kroll, head of the police union, told Fox News that he found out about the ban soon after Trump announced the rally. Kroll told Fox News that \"Cops for Trump\" shirts that were made up in response are selling out. Proceeds for the shirts are going to police union charities.\n\nIn the past, Frey has spoken out against the president, calling his actions \u201creprehensible\u201d and saying that Trump\u2019s \u201cmessage of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis,\" the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement that Frey was demonstrating \u201can outrageous abuse of power\u201d and that he was \u201ctrying to deny the rights of his own city\u2019s residents just because he hates the president.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said they will take legal action if AEG does not honor their contract by late Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cWe are well aware of Mayor Frey\u2019s vocal partisan opposition to President Trump and calls to disrupt the rally,\u201d read a letter from Trump law firm Jones Day to AEG. \u201cThis last-minute squeeze seems to be nothing but a pretextual political effort with serious First Amendment ramifications.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNeither AEG nor Frey\u2019s office immediately responded to Fox News\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nThe $530,000 figure dwarfs the costs incurred by another Minnesota city for a 2018 rally. Last October\u2019s event cost the city of Rochester $76,138, with the campaign paying $26,215 to hold the rally at the Mayo Civic Center.\n\nA campaign statement also pointed out that when then-President Barack Obama held a rally at the Target Center in 2009, police estimated that costs amounted to approximately $20,000.", "description": "President Trump called Tuesday for Minneapolis voters to \u201cdump\u201d Mayor Jacob Frey \u2013\u00a0as well as Rep.
