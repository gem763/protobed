Add Jamal Khashoggi as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jamal Khashoggi news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed, Erdogan described the journalist's killing by a Saudi hit squad as \"arguably the most influential and controversial incident of the 21st century\" and blamed the murder on a \"shadow state within the kingdom's government \u2014 not the Saudi state or people.\"\n\nThe Turkish leader wrote: \"We will keep asking the same questions... Where are Khashoggi's remains? Who signed the Saudi journalist's death warrant? Who dispatched the 15 killers, including a forensic expert, aboard the two planes to Istanbul?\"\n\nKhashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to collect a document that he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee. Agents of the Saudi government killed Khashoggi inside the consulate and apparently dismembered his body, which has never been found.\n\nSaudi Arabia initially offered multiple, shifting accounts about Khashoggi's disappearance. As international pressure mounted, the kingdom eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed by rogue officials in a brawl inside their consulate.\n\nThe kingdom has put 11 people on trial in non-public proceedings. No one has been convicted so far.\n\nErdogan criticized the court proceedings in Saudi Arabia, which he said lacked transparency and maintained that some of Khashoggi's murderers \"enjoy de facto freedom.\" The court proceedings \"tarnish the image of Saudi Arabia,\" Erdogan added.\n\nA U.N. report released earlier this year asserted that Saudi Arabia bore responsibility for the killing and that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's possible role should be investigated.\n\nOn Sunday, Prince Mohammed said in a television interview that he takes \"full responsibility\" for Khashoggi's death but denied allegations that he ordered it.\n\n\"This was a heinous crime,\" Prince Mohammed, 34, told \"60 Minutes.\" ''But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
