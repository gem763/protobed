REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo\n\nModi is travelling to the United States to speak at the UN General Assembly, seven weeks after his government revoked the partial autonomy enjoyed by Muslim-majority Kashmir in a move that prompted anger in the region and in neighbouring Pakistan, which also lays claim to it.\n\nBefore travelling to the United Nations headquarters in New York, Modi will address a rally at a stadium in Houston that Trump has also agreed to attend.\n\n\u201cThe special gesture of President @realDonaldTrump to join us in Houston highlights the strength of the relationship and recognition of the contribution of the Indian community to American society and economy,\u201d Modi said in a Tweet.\n\nThough there have been recent tensions between Washington and New Delhi over trade and tariffs, the two men have shown a warm personal rapport at previous meetings.\n\nAbout 50,000 people have registered for the \u201cHowdy, Modi\u201d community event, at which Trump will also speak, the biggest crowd that the Indian leader has drawn after a rock-show like rally at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden in 2014.\n\nThat was the first big attempt by Modi\u2019s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to rouse the prosperous Diaspora in the United States - home to 4 million Indian-Americans - and lobby for India\u2019s interests in the way countries such as Israel have done.\n\nVijay Chauthaiwale, the chief of the BJP\u2019s foreign affairs department, told Reuters from Houston that Trump\u2019s decision to attend the event was a surprise, but testified to the power of the U.S. Indian community as well as the importance Trump attached to bilateral ties, despite recent trade frictions.\n\n\u201cThe strategic relationship is stronger,\u201d he said.\n\nModi\u2019s move to end the special constitutional status of Kashmir, where hundreds of people have been detained, mobile and internet services suspended and public gatherings curbed, has drawn expressions of concern from foreign governments, including the U.S. State Department, which called for restraint.\n\nPakistan has condemned the crackdown and its Prime Minister Imran Khan, who will also be speaking at the UN, warned it would drive more of the world\u2019s Muslims into extremism.\n\nDIPLOMATIC VICTORY\n\nModi\u2019s supporters say he has won a diplomatic victory by getting Trump on his side.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve developed quite a good camaraderie between them, leaders of the two most influential democracies on earth,\u201d said Shalab Kumar, an Indian-American businessman who founded the Republican Hindu Coalition, modelled on the Republican Jewish Coalition, in 2015.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re finally coming together on one stage, that\u2019s great particularly after abrogation (of Kashmir\u2019s special status). This is probably the biggest endorsement of the United States to Modi, that the move was the correct move.\u201d\n\nIn a statement confirming Trump\u2019s attendance in Houston, the White House said the president would discuss with Modi ways to deepen the two countries\u2019 energy and trade relationship.\n\nModi, whose domestic agenda combines a Hindu nationalist platform with pro-business policies, is popular among Indian-Americans, a group that has not traditionally voted homogeneously in U.S. elections.\n\nDemocratic candidates seeking the party\u2019s nomination for the 2020 presidential election include Kamala Harris, whose mother was an Indian-American breast cancer researcher, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Hindu Samoan-American.\n\nTrump had briefly raised concern in India when he offered to mediate the Kashmir dispute with Pakistan. New Delhi, which has long bristled at third-party involvement, said altering the status of the territory was an internal matter.\n\nIt has instead blamed Pakistan for trying to sow trouble there, an allegation Islamabad denies.\n\nThe Indian American Muslim Council said it planned protests at the Houston stadium against what it said were Modi\u2019s divisive policies.", "description": "With U.S. President Donald Trump by his side, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will seek to fire up thousands of Indian-American supporters at a rally in Texas on Sunday, shrugging off international criticism over a crackdown in disputed Kashmir.", "authors": ["Sanjeev Miglani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431600293&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I106", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
