Shape Created with Sketch. 21 actors who took their roles so seriously it got out of hand 1/21 Nicolas Cage Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011). Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage has pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984). 2/21 Hilary Swank Hilary Swank's exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection \u2013 caused by a burst blister on her foot \u2013 was hours away from reaching her heart. Warner Bros 3/21 Heath Ledger Such was the extent of Heath Ledger's commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character's ramblings. 4/21 Val Kilmer Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track. The actor had become so obsessed with the role that he ended up learning fifty of Morrison's songs and had everyone call him \"Jim\" on set of the 1991 biopic. 5/21 Johnny Depp Johnny Depp risked his life while preparing for the role of Hunter Thompson in Terry Gilliam's 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; he took hard drugs and spent his nights sleeping next to extremely dangerous containers of gunpowder and nitroglycerin. 6/21 Shia LaBeouf For war thriller Fury (2014), Shia LaBeouf slashed his own cheek and pulled a tooth out during filming. He also didn't wash for an entire month forcing the crew to arrange a separate room for him during night-time shoots. 7/21 Rooney Mara Rooney Mara completely changed her image to play the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher's 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She cut her hair, bleached her eyebrows and pierced her nipples to get into the mindset of the cyber hacker at the heart of Stieg Larrson's novels. 8/21 Natalie Portman Natalie Portman certainly worked for the Best Actress Oscar she received for 2010 film Black Swan. She shunned any suggestion of a body double for the film's extremely challenging dance scenes. 9/21 Joaquin Phoenix In 2008, Joaquin Phoenix displayed some bizarre behaviour after he quit acting to become a hip-hop artist. It was later revealed that his life upheaval \u2013 strange interviews included \u2013 was, in fact, a giant hoax for mockumentary I'm Still here 10/21 Ashton Kutcher After hearing that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had a diet comprised of just fruit, Ashton Kutcher thought he'd do the same in preparation for his role in biopic Jobs (2013). He ended up hospitalised for severe vitamin deficiencies as well as a reduction in bone density. But for the role of Steve Jobs, Kutcher went on a complete fruit diet \u2013 just like real life Steve Jobs. And two days before the filming Kutcher ended up in the hospital with severe Vitamin deficiencies and reduction in bone density. 11/21 Halle Berry After \"begging\" Spike Lee to let her play the role of crack addict Vivian in his 1991 film Jungle Fever, Halle Berry proved her dedication to the role by refusing to bathe for two whole weeks. 12/21 Dustin Hoffman Meryl Streep has recounted the time Dustin Hoffman slapped her and insulted her then boyfriend on their first take filming 1979 divorce drama Kramer vs Kramer, something everyone can agree was an unacceptable step too far. 13/21 Daniel Day-Lewis Known to be one of the biggest Method actors around, Daniel Day-Lewis spent six months alone in the wilderness in preparation for his role in The Last of the Mohicans (1992). 14/21 Anne Hathaway Anne Hathaway may have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012), but the role of Fantine \u2013 which saw her cut off her hair and eat nothing but lettuce and oatmeal paste \u2013 left her in \"a state of deprivation, both physically and emotionally\". 15/21 Christian Bale Christian Bale has since vowed not to mess with his weight again following his Oscar win for Vice earlier this year but, back in 2004, he lost such an alarming amount of weight for the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist that he became virtually unrecognisable. \"I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I've been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits,\" he went on to tell the BBC. 16/21 Charlize Theron While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it's her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. Focus Features 17/21 Danny DeVito The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film. DeVito went so far as to dream up an imaginary friend \u2013 one he became convinced was real. 18/21 Adrien Brody To get into the lead role of Oscar-winning film The Pianist (2002), Adrien Brody upheaved his life so much that it took him over a year and a half to get things back on track; not only did he starve himself to a staggering degree, but sold his home and broke up with his long-term girlfriend. 19/21 Jared Leto The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016's Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew. 20/21 Kate Winslet Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family. She compared leaving the character behind her to escaping a serious car crash. 21/21 Robert De Niro For Taxi Driver, most actors wouldn't have got themselves a fake license and cruised around New York City throughout the night to get into the role of the deranged Travis Bickle, but that's precisely what Robert De Niro ended up doing in 1976. 1/21 Nicolas Cage Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011).

The flimsy structure is flattened and the woman is deposited face-down upon the wreckage, presumably among the sticky remnants of the eggs.\n\nFortunately, the verge against which the egg stall had been standing stops the car\u2019s unexpected movement before it can squash her, and it comes to a halt \u2013 hazard warning lights flashing.\n\nShe appears to emerge relatively unscathed, and picking splinters of wood from herself, gets to her feet and reverses the car off the razed egg-stall.\n\nHowever, the footage suggests the victim had no intention of driving off without the eggs she came for. She returns to the flattened structure, picks out six undamaged eggs, puts them in a box, gets back in her car and drives off.\n\nChris Puxted, whose CCTV recorded the incident, told Caters\u2019 News Agency: \u201cIt just goes to show, you should never forget to put your handbrake on.\n\n\u201cIt just sneaked up on her so she had no chance.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He suffered a broken pelvis, collapsed lung and was in a coma for several weeks.", "description": "A woman has been run over by her own car after she got out of the vehicle without properly putting the handbrake on.
