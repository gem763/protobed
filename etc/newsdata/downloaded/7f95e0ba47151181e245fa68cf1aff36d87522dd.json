Trump told reporters at the Oval office that the Washington and Beijing reached a \u201csubstantial, phase-one\u201d deal to ease trade tensions.\n\nAs part of this new phase, China will be purchasing between $40 billion and $50 billion U.S. agricultural commodities. Trump also said that to some extent foreign-exchange issues with China have been sorted. The pact will surely discourage China from devaluing its currency.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has agreed to hold off tariffs that were set to take effect on Oct 15. What\u2019s more, the United States may lessen exports bans on blacklisted Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei Technologies Co. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also sounded optimistic and said that both the sides have struck an \u201calmost complete agreement\u201d over trade and currency disputes.\n\nInvestors have been eagerly waiting for some encouraging news on the trade front. Lest we forget, a flurry of headlines raised doubts about whether the U.S.-China trade talks will be fruitful. Both Washington and Beijing were supposed to resume talks with import tariffs set at $250 billion worth of Chinese commodities at a rate of 30%. But, chances of successful trade talks diminished after the Trump administration blacklisted 28 Chinese companies, including AI firms, over human rights concerns.\n\nNonetheless, hopes of at least a limited U.S.-China trade deal helped the stock market scale northward. The Dow jumped more than 300 points on Oct 11, helping the blue-chip index put an end to a three-week losing streak. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq a ended the week in the green.\n\nAmong the sectors, tech and chipmakers rose significantly.\n\nMost importantly, bank stocks gained traction. Shares of bank stocks moved north as U.S. treasury yields rose. As investors took money out of bonds and opted for stocks, bond prices declined, leading to an uptick in yields. Needless to say, a rise in long-term yields boosts banks\u2019 profit margin as it increases the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, and shorter-term liabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose 9.9 basis points to 1.748%, a three-week high. At the same time, the yield on the 30-year Treasury note advanced 6.4 basis points to 2.210%, extending a weeklong climb of 19.3 basis points.\n\n5 Best Bank Stocks to Buy Now\n\nWe have, thus, selected five solid bank stocks that are poised to gain from rise in bond yields.
