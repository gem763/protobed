Wochit, Wochit\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden again called for President Donald Trump to release the transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky amid reports that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday that the media \"says I 'pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.' This supposedly comes from a so-called \"whistleblower\" who they say doesn\u2019t even have a first hand account of what was said.\"\n\nBiden's account responded: \"So release the transcript of the call then.\u201d\n\nAt issue are two developments that have come to a head in the last week.\n\nSo release the transcript of the call then. https://t.co/pWD7xmVLQO \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 23, 2019\n\nTrump's tweet is a reference to a Wall Street Journal report that stated Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son, and to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on the matter.\n\nThat phone call is reportedly the subject of a whistleblower complaint by a U.S. intelligence official, according to both the Washington Post and The New York Times.\n\nLawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump confirmed that he discussed Biden during a phone call on July 25 with Zelensky, saying the \"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory.\"\n\nHowever, during a meeting Monday at the United Nations, Trump claimed that he, \"didn\u2019t do it\u201d and that he hoped people would see a transcript of the call because they would be \u201cvery disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make a determination about how to release it, releasing it, saying what we said,\u201d Trump also said Sunday, while defending his conversation as \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nBiden told reporters on Saturday, \u201cHe\u2019s doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum. And he\u2019s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me.\"\n\nThe president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions about whether Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.\n\nBut Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that \"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nBiden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine\u2019s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was eventually voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.\n\nSome moderate Republicans and Democrats have raised the alarm over the reports that Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate his political rival.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mitt Romney said Sunday that it \"would be troubling in the extreme\" in a tweet if Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Biden.\n\n\"At this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Sunday, \"it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it.\"\n\nContributing: John Fritze, Bart Jansen, Nicholas Wu, David Jackson, Michael Collins, Deirdre Shesgreen.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/23/joe-biden-trump-release-transcript-call-ukrainian-president/2422512001/", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden again called for President Donald Trump to release the transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
