The agency has also affirmed AIS's and AWN's National Long-Term Rating at 'AA+(tha)' with a Stable Outlook. Key Rating Drivers Ratings Equalised: AIS's and AWN's ratings are equalised to reflect the strong links between the two companies, in line with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. AIS fully owns AWN, enabling it to control the subsidiary's strategy, financial policy and investments. AWN is the main subsidiary within the group, accounting for 94% of group revenue and 80% of EBITDA in 2018. It is of strategic importance to its parent as the operator of AIS's licensed mobile business. AWN was awarded 2.1GHz, 1.8GHz and 900MHz licences, and participated in the 700MHz spectrum allocation in June 2019. Mid-Single-Digit Revenue Growth: Fitch expects AIS's service revenue, including mobile and fixed-broadband, to increase by around 4%-5% in 2019 and 2020 (1H19: 4.1%), supported by a continued rise in mobile-data usage and fixed-broadband subscribers. We forecast mobile-service revenue to grow by 3%-4% in 2019, boosted by an acceleration in 2H19, offsetting the slow growth in 1Q19, as competition in the sector has eased. In 2Q19, all major mobile operators in Thailand gradually started to phase out the generous unlimited prepaid data plans that were launched in 2018. The company's fixed-broadband revenue will continue to increase strongly to around THB5.5 billion in 2019 from THB4.4 billion in 2018 (1H19: THB2.7 billion) as it aims to reach one million subscribers by end-2019 (end-2018: 731,000 subscribers). Robust Cash Flow: Fitch expects AIS's funds from operation (FFO) to remain strong in 2019 at around THB75 billion (2018: THB73 billion in 2018). Its EBITDA margin may, however, decrease to around 42%-43% in 2019 from 43.5% in 2018 due to an increase in network operating expense. However, the EBITDA margin is likely to improve to 44%-45% in 2020 on cost savings from a settlement of its disputes with TOT Public Company Limited in September 2019 over tower ownership and 2G equipment rentals. The rental fee on TOT's towers will fall to around THB2.8 billion per annum, depending on usage, from the current fee of THB3.6 billion per annum, while AIS will stop paying TOT rental fees for 2G equipment, currently around THB2 billion per annum, from September 2019. Flexibility to Support Investment: AIS's free cash flow (FCF) is likely to remain positive in 2019 (2018: THB3.4 billion) due to lower spectrum payments and falling capex after it completes the major rollout phase of its 3G and 4G networks. Network investment is likely to decrease to around THB25 billion-27 billion per annum in 2019 and 2020, from THB41 billion-48 billion per annum during the peak investment period in 2016-2017. FFO adjusted net leverage to is likely to stay around 1.6x in 2019 and 2020 (2018: 1.6x), providing AIS with moderate headroom and financial flexibility to support additional investment, particularly in new spectrum and 5G. Leading Market Position: AIS has maintained its leading market position as Thailand's largest mobile-phone operator. Fitch believes AIS should be able to maintain its service-revenue market share of around 50% in the medium term (1H19: 48%). AIS benefits from economies of scale due to its large subscriber base as well as a strong brand and extensive network coverage. Derivation Summary AIS's credit profile is supported by its solid market position as Thailand's largest mobile-phone operator and its conservative financial profile. AIS is rated higher than domestic peer, Total Access Communication Public Company Limited (DTAC; BBB/Negative), due to the latter's smaller size, weaker market position and lower profit margin. DTAC's 'BBB' ratings incorporate a one-notch uplift from its Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) of 'bbb-' due to the moderate linkages with its parent, Telenor ASA of Norway, which has strong board and management control over DTAC. AIS's ratings are at the same level as the 'bbb+' SCP of Malaysia's fixed-broadband operator, Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM, A-/Negative). TM has a better business profile than AIS in light of its market dominance and the benign competition in Malaysia's fixed-broadband market, but AIS has a stronger financial profile due to lower leverage, its larger size and wider EBITDA margin. AIS is rated one notch above the Philippines' largest telecom operator, PLDT Inc. (BBB/Stable), due to its more conservative financial leverage of less than 2.0x (PLDT: around 3.0x) offsetting its lack of product diversification. Key Assumptions Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer - Mid-single-digit service revenue growth in 2019 and 2020 - Operating EBITDA margin of 42%-43% in 2019 and improving to 44%-45% in 2020 (2018: 43.5%) - THB26 billion-28 billion a year in network capex in 2019 and 2020 (2018: THB20.2 billion) - 75% dividend payout ratio RATING SENSITIVITIES Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Positive FCF and FFO adjusted net leverage reducing to below 1.0x on a sustained basis without deterioration in revenue market share Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - FFO adjusted net leverage above 2.0x for a sustained period - Unfavourable regulatory changes Advanced Wireless Network Company Limited Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Positive rating action on AIS, provided linkages between AIS and AWN do not weaken Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Negative rating action on AIS Liquidity and Debt Structure Strong Liquidity: AIS's liquidity should remain strong even though its cash balance at end-2018 of THB9.0 billion is not sufficient to cover the THB17.1 billion debt due in 2019. However, we expect AIS to generate strong FCF of around THB13.9 billion in 2019, which is more than enough to cover the shortfall during the period. In addition, Fitch believes AIS has easy access to domestic debt capital in light of its strong credit profile.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
