I used our last name as my character's name. And he said, 'that's a terrible idea. Why would you do that? People will be confused.'\"\n\nNBC\n\n\"You just can't win sometimes,\" Penn joked.\n\nPenn was born Kalpen Suresh Modi, but he changed his stage moniker early on in his career in hopes of landing more acting gigs.\n\nHis character, Garrett Modi, is a disgraced politician in the new NBC prime-time comedy, \"Sunnyside.\" Modi finds his calling when he encounters a group of immigrants in desperate need of his help. The show was not meant to be political, but more a satire depicting the everyday life of a politician, Penn said.\n\n\"What I like about this character and the show is that it's totally divorced of my real-life experiences,\" Penn, 42, told Travers. \"I obviously loved my time in D.C. And I am the child of immigrants. So I know those stories very intimately. But I love making people laugh. And I love that comedy has the opportunity to bring people together, especially when things are polarizing.\"\n\nJeff Swartz/ABC News\n\nDuring the early planning stages of the show, Penn, who helped create the show, said they had to put production on pause for several years as he finished three seasons on the show \"Designated Survivor.\"\n\n\"And five years ago, the issue of immigration was not as polarizing as today. But we never set out to make a show about politics. We're a patriotic comedy that is relevant and timely for sure,\" he said. \"But it's more about this weird guy -- this arrogant weird guy who I play ... it's more of a redemption story for him.\"\n\nPenn said viewers may even be disappointed with \"Sunnyside\" if they're looking for a show centered on immigration.\n\n\"It's about lively characters and how they interact, more than it is about an issue,\" he said.\n\nWatch the full interview with Peter Travers and Kal Penn in the video above.\n\nDownload the all new \"Popcorn With Peter Travers\" podcasts on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Tunein, Google Play Music and Stitcher.", "description": "When it came time to choose a name for his 'Sunnyside' character, Kal Penn decided to use his real last name.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/kal-penn-sunnyside-ht-ml-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
