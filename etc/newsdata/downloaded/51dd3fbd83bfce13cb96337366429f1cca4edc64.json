The fees, the SFO argues, were paid under a \"pretend\" agreement that purported Qatar was delivering advisory services.\n\n\"These agreements were an invention, used as a means to hide the additional fees that were in truth being paid to the Qataris for investing,\" Mr Brown said during a opening argument that's expected to last the rest of the week. \"The Qatari investment had to be achieved and this meant telling lies.Telling lies in this way, say the prosecution, is a criminal offence, committing fraud by false representation.\"\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe trial is the most high-profile case targeting top bankers for events taking place during the financial crisis. It is also the most significant case ever brought by the SFO. The three men pleaded not guilty on Monday, and their attorneys will start to present their opening arguments next week.\n\nFormer Barclays Finance Director Chris Lucas was part of the conspiracy, but is too ill to stand trial, Mr Brown said.\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [LONDON] Three senior ex-Barclays Plc executives kept other investors in the dark about millions of pounds in fees the bank was paying Qatar during the struggle to save the lender at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, a prosecutor told a London jury on the opening day of an historic fraud trial. .
