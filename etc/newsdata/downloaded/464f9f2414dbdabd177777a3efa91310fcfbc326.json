Over the course of our review process, it became clear that Apple had indeed achieved that. Apple says it has a class-leading camera every year, but this time it actually does.\n\nThe next question, then, is how big a leap will come with Google\u2019s new Pixel 4. We still can\u2019t answer that yet, just as we didn\u2019t know how good the iPhone 11 was the day after its announcement. (You can see some quick comparisons here, but stay tuned for the full review.) We can, however, take a lot from what Google did \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 have to say on stage yesterday.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t forget about the camera,\u201d Google\u2019s Sabrina Ellis said near the end of the presentation. \u201cWith Pixel 4 we\u2019re raising the bar yet again, and it all starts with this little square.\u201d \u201cLittle\u201d is perhaps a charitable description of the Pixel 4\u2019s conspicuous camera bump, but that bump does of course house what should amount to the biggest change to the Pixel camera.\n\n\u201cWide angle can be fun, but we think telephoto is more important.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just get this out of the way: it\u2019s weird that Google went for a telephoto lens as its second option. \u201cWide angle can be fun, but we think telephoto is more important,\u201d computational photography lead Marc Levoy said on stage. That\u2019s not an unreasonable position \u2014 Apple certainly agreed during the last three years it put out dual-camera phones before switching to ultrawide with the iPhone 11. But Google spent a lot of time last year touting its Super Res Zoom feature that uses multi-frame algorithms to improve the quality of traditional digital zoom. It wasn\u2019t better than an optical telephoto lens, of course, but it was better than nothing, and Google is continuing to use it for the Pixel 4\u2019s extended zoom range.\n\nAn ultrawide lens, on the other hand, can\u2019t be faked in software. The reason to include one is because it\u2019s the only way to achieve that perspective. Why, when finally deciding to add a second lens after years of insisting it wasn\u2019t necessary, would Google choose glass that solves a problem it already had a passable solution for, instead of something that makes entirely new types of photos possible?\n\nOr, and hear me out here, why not just add an ultrawide and a telephoto? These are expensive phones. That is a big camera bump. Every single one of Google\u2019s competitors in the premium market now sells phones with triple-camera setups \u2014 it\u2019s not that exotic a feature any more. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see it on the Pixel 5.\n\nOverall, Google had almost nothing to say about the Pixel 4\u2019s camera hardware on stage beyond the acknowledgement of the second lens. It turns out the main lens has received a slight aperture increase, going to f/1.7 from f/1.8, while the sensor remains 12 megapixels and is presumably the same size as before.\n\n\u201cBut the hardware isn\u2019t what makes our camera so much better,\u201d Ellis went on. \u201cThe special sauce that makes our pixel camera unique is computational photography.\u201d That is certainly true, and what followed was an engaging presentation from Levoy on how the Pixel works its magic. Or, as he described it in a wry swipe at Apple: \u201cIt\u2019s not mad science, it\u2019s just simple physics.\u201d\n\nAfter explaining the basic principles of HDR+, Levoy detailed four new computational additions to the Pixel 4 camera. The first was Live HDR+, which uses machine learning to calculate HDR+ in real time so you can see it in the viewfinder. This also allows you to control the camera\u2019s exposure with sliders for brightness and shadows, which could make it a lot easier to lock in the results you want.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mad science, it\u2019s just simple physics.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the Pixel 4 now uses machine learning for white balance in all modes, instead of just Night Sight \u2014 the examples Levoy used included a snow scene, which trips up traditional cameras all the time. The Pixel 4 portrait mode uses the telephoto lens to create a better depth map and work with a wider range of subjects. And Night Sight now has an astrophotography function that merges images across four-minute exposures to produce pin-sharp photos of stars.\n\nAll of these features sound cool, and I could watch Marc Levoy talk about HDR algorithms for hours. But it\u2019s hard to know whether the announcements will add up to meaningful, noticeable improvements in pure image quality for the types of photos we take every day. I\u2019m looking forward to taking pictures of stars on my phone, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a selling point. What matters is the extent to which Google has managed to push its core photographic results forward.\n\nThis is basically what I thought about the iPhone 11 after its launch, of course, and it turned out to be the biggest leap for Apple in several years despite what appeared to be near-identical hardware. We won\u2019t know how good the Pixel 4 camera really is until we\u2019ve spent more time with it. But the Pixel 3 camera is still one of the best in the world, so there\u2019s no reason to expect anything short of greatness.\n\nWe just wonder about that missing ultrawide.", "description": "Google has had the best smartphone cameras for years, but the iPhone 11 is its strongest competitor yet.
