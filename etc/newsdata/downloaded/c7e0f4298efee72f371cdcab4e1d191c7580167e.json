Preliminary reports have pointed to an anti-stall system that kicked in based on faulty sensor readings and pushed the noses of the planes down.\n\nBoeing officials have said the pilots didn\u2019t follow known procedures for stopping a sudden nose-down pitch or, in the case of the Ethiopian crash, followed the procedures only briefly.\n\nThe safety board said Boeing assumed that pilots flying the Max would respond to an automated nose-down push by taking \u201cimmediate and appropriate\u201d steps. Federal regulations allow manufacturers to make such assumptions, and Boeing even used test pilots in flight simulators to check its assumptions.\n\nBoeing presented highly trained test pilots only with a single alert indicating a condition known as runaway stabilizer trim, which can be triggered by the MCAS anti-stall system, safety board officials said. They said Boeing failed to consider that an underlying problem like sensor failures \u2014 which triggered MCAS in both Max crashes \u2014 would set off several alarms.\n\nIn the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes , they said, the pilots\u2019 control columns would have shaken to warn of an impending stall, they would have gotten several visual and sound alerts about things like altitude and speed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the actual scenario that never got evaluated in the simulator,\u201d said Dana Schulze, the board\u2019s director of aviation safety.\n\nSchulze said years of research have shown that when multiple alarms compete for the attention of pilots, it can lead to a situation in which \u201cpilots will not respond as perhaps you might have intended.\u201d\n\nThe safety board will recommend that the Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the Max to fly in 2017, evaluate the effect that all possible cockpit alerts might have on pilot response. The board also recommended that FAA require Boeing to include changes in cockpit design or pilot training to help pilots follow proper procedures when responding to the Max\u2019s automated control systems.\n\nSchulze told reporters that the board wants FAA to take those steps before it lets the Max fly again, although the board did not put a timetable in its formal recommendations.\n\nThe safety board recommended that FAA examine whether other aircraft besides the Max might have been approved without considering how multiple alarms could distract pilots. They also said FAA should encourage other regulators in Canada, Europe and elsewhere to do the same thing.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the FAA said it will review the NTSB\u2019s recommendations as it continues to evaluate changes that will be made to the Max.\n\n\u201cThe FAA is committed to a philosophy of continuous improvement,\u201d the statement said.\n\nBoeing issued a short statement saying it would work with FAA in reviewing the recommendations.\n\nThe Max has been grounded worldwide since March, shortly after the second crash. Boeing is nearing completion of changes that will make MCAS less powerful and tie it to a second sensor measuring the plane\u2019s pitch instead of just one sensor.\n\nBoeing expects that airlines will be able to fly the plane later this year, although many analysts think early 2020 is more likely.", "description": "The National Transportation Safety Board gave several safety recommendations after investigations into two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jets.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH169_737_Gr_ZG_20190408135513.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
