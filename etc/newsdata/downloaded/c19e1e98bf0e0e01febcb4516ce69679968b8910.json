The dead ranged in age from 15 to 57, while among the injured was a 17-month-old toddler.\n\nThe gunman, who was shot and killed by officers, is believed to have been working alone, police said on Sunday. The FBI said there was no apparent link to domestic or international terrorism. He was using an AR-style weapon, police said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, many of the leading Democrats seeking the 2020 presidential nomination repeated their calls for universal background checks, as they did after incidents last month in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, who was outspoken after last month\u2019s shooting in his home town of El Paso, told CNN the situation in regard to gun violence in the country was \u201cf***ed up\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re averaging about 300 mass shooting a year. No other country comes close,\u201d he told CNN.\n\n\u201cSo yes, this is f***ed up. If we don\u2019t call it out for what it is, if we\u2019re not able to speak clearly, if we\u2019re not able to act decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America, and I cannot accept that.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Mr O\u2019Rourke said if he became president he would force a government buyback of semi-automatic weapons, such as the AR-15 rifle, used in many mass shootings.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Today, it\u2019s in Odessa, Texas. Yesterday it was in Alabama. Before that, it was Dayton, El Paso, Brooklyn, Gilroy and San Fernando Valley. That\u2019s just in the past month alone.\u201d\n\nFollowing the shooting in Texas, where three police officers were among those injured, Matt Schaefer, a Republican member of the Texas state legislature, sparked controversy when he tweeted he would not let such \u201cevil acts\u201d stop the \u201cGod-given rights of Texans\u201d.\n\n\u201cI say NO to \u2018red flag\u2019 pre-crime laws,\u201d he said. \u201cNO to universal background checks. NO to bans on AR-15s, or high capacity magazines. NO to mandatory gun buybacks.\u201d\n\nThe rampage between the cities of Midland and Odessa started on Saturday afternoon when state troopers pulled over a car on Interstate 20 and the lone occupant fired at their patrol vehicle with a rifle, wounding one of the troopers.\n\nAfter fleeing the scene, the suspect hijacked a postal van and opened fire on police officers, motorists and shoppers on a busy Labour Day holiday weekend before being shot dead outside the Cinergy cinema complex.\n\nOdessa police chief Michael Gerke said at a news conference on Sunday he would not name the shooter in order not to add to his notoriety, though he it would be provided to the media. \u201cMy heart aches for all the victims,\u201d he said.\n\nShannon Watts, the founder of Founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun regulation group, told The Independent that gun violence was a complex problem.\n\n\u201cNo single law will prevent every shooting, but the senate can act NOW on legislation that will reduce gun violence and will save lives,\u201d she said. \u201cBackground checks do save lives \u2013 the data shows that in the 21 states that have closed this loophole.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Donald Trump has claimed background checks on gun buyers would not have stopped any of the mass shootings to have devastated America over the past half-dozen years.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/12/trump-background-0.jpg"}
