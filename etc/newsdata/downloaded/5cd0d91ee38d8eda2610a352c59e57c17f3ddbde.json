Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., two of the three African-Americans in the Senate. Some Republicans said they were also uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s choice of language.\n\n\u201cLynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation\u2019s history, as is this President,\u201d Harris tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019ll never erase the pain and trauma of lynching, and to invoke that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cLynching is an act of terror used to uphold white supremacy,\u201d Booker tweeted. \u201cTry again.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the lone black Republican in the Senate, said he could understand the point Trump was trying to make.\n\n\u201cThe impeachment process is the closest thing [to] a political death-row trial, so I get his absolute rejection of the process,\u201d Scott said, adding: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018lynching.\u2019\u201d\n\nSens. Tim Scott, R-S.C.; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

The so-called Justice for Victims of Lynching Act was led by Harris, Booker and Scott.\n\nThe term refers primarily to abductions and murders of African-Americans in the post-Reconstruction South as a form of vigilante justice and a way to enforce white supremacy. Some lynching victims were white.\n\nAt his weekly press briefing, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201clynching\u201d was \u201cnot the language I would use.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with that language,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nBut Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, did.\n\n\u201cThe connotation the president is carrying forward is a political mob seeking an outcome regardless of facts,\u201d Cruz told reporters. \u201cAnd that I think is an objectively true description of what is happening in the House right now.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the president\u2019s staunchest defenders in Congress, said he fully supports Trump\u2019s characterization.\n\n\u201cThis is a lynching in every sense,\u201d Graham said.\n\nGraham backs up Trump's \"lynching\" comment about impeachment inquiry: \"Yeah, this is a lynching in every sense.\" pic.twitter.com/va93ja4SSG \u2014 TPM Livewire (@TPMLiveWire) October 22, 2019\n\nOther Republicans, though, criticized the president\u2019s language.\n\n\u201cWe can all disagree on the process, and argue merits,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut never should we use terms like \u2018lynching\u2019 here. The painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and @realDonaldTrump should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President is not a victim,\u201d Jeb Bush tweeted. \u201cHe should be the most powerful person on the planet. To equate his plight to lynching is grotesque.\u201d\n\nTrump made the inflammatory comparison on Twitter hours before Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, was scheduled to testify in the inquiry behind closed doors. In text messages released earlier in October, Taylor expressed concern to another diplomat about Trump\u2019s withholding of military aid to Ukraine while asking the country to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Taylor texted that it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d", "description": "President Trump's comparison of the House Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry to \u201ca lynching\u201d was promptly condemned by many critics.
