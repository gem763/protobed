Persistence", "language": "en", "text": "Elizabeth Warren is in the best position to win next year\u2019s Iowa caucuses \u2013 which kick off the Democratic party\u2019s primary season in February \u2013 by virtue of, yes, persistence.\n\nThe Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom Iowa poll \u2013 the gold standard of polling \u2013 gave the strongest indication yet when it reported Saturday that Warren has 22% support of likely Iowa caucus-goers, while Joe Biden has 20% and Bernie Sanders 11%. It was the first poll to show the Massachusetts senator from Oklahoma with a lead over the former vice-president.\n\nWarren has demonstrated a steady rise in polling and support since she announced her campaign in January by first sweeping through the snowy reaches of rural, conservative western Iowa. This is where Donald Trump blew out Hillary Clinton by 20 points.\n\nClinton never showed up.\n\nWarren attracted a crowd of some 300 people in Storm Lake, where I live, that day. Aides had every visitor signed up on cellphones as they waited in line to enter. Mainly women over 50, all got their photo taken with Warren. They nodded their heads when she talked about the economy working for Wall Street and Washington but not for Main Street. Something was happening.\n\nJoe Biden, by contrast, is just now ramping up staff in Iowa\n\nShe brought an army of organizers, much of the state\u2019s top caucus talent, with her. They stayed, and she has returned regularly with a populist message built on breaking up the huge agriculture conglomerates, Medicare for All, putting a 2% tax on wealth over $50m, declaring war on lobbyists and going all-in on climate change.\n\nBiden, by contrast, is just now ramping up staff in Iowa. He has been running in Iowa since 1988 and has a large reservoir of good will here. His campaign has been remote, and the poll reports Warren supporters with higher enthusiasm. He has yet to visit Storm Lake.\n\nWarren came to the Polk County Steak Fry where 12,000 Democrats gathered in the rain last weekend in Des Moines calling for impeachment and itching for a fight. Joe Biden found himself fending off uncomfortable questions about his son\u2019s work in Ukraine. And that\u2019s what bugs the ordinary people I know in my meatpacking town of 15,000 where you take a shower after work: politics is about the gilded trading on each other\u2019s power.\n\nWarren pledges to turn it all inside out, summoning the spirit of Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt before tens of thousands on Washington Square. Those echoes have powerful appeal around here, too, not far from where the Populist party convened with William Jennings Bryan in Omaha just before the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIowans are fed up with trade wars, big oil and a broken Medicaid system that\u2019s not providing enough nursing homes. The admissions clerk at our hospital just shakes her head when you talk about the financial woes of working people who can\u2019t meet their deductibles. She knows that something needs to change. Rural hospitals and mental health providers are on the brink of shuttering. Farmers see the effects of extreme weather and want to do something about it.\n\nWarren addresses their concerns. But not everyone is convinced.\n\nMy sister-in-law, a member of the Buena Vista County Democratic Central Committee, asked me:\n\n\u201cBut is she too progressive?\u201d\n\nShe likes Warren. She likes Medicare, but could Medicare for All \u2013 the promise to deliver universal healthcare to Americans \u2013 sink Warren? According to polls, 40% say they like it, another 18% are amenable, 8% don\u2019t know. My sister-in-law is among the 82% of likely caucus-goers open to persuasion. Yet she worries.\n\nThere are other doubts, too. Like can a female progressive populist win Wisconsin? I point to Senator Tammy Baldwin. A lesbian, no less, in a state of German Catholics and Lutherans. Yeah, but the pain of Clinton\u2019s defeat is so fresh in the memory, my sister-in-law says. It creates a reticence that is real.\n\nAs Warren slowly rose in the polls, Biden\u2019s backing eroded here over the summer. History tells us someone from the shadows will pop into the glare as John Kerry did: Pete Buttigieg, with a ton of money and a keen understanding of midwest troubles from South Bend, remains well in the game at 9%. He went on a bus tour of rural towns just after the steak fry to good reviews. Kamala Harris says she is moving to Iowa. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota jokes that she can see Iowa from her front porch. She knows the territory. Do Iowans connect with her talk of pragmatism? You betcha. She had a couple hundred during State Fair Week in Storm Lake, before Labor Day, and everyone liked her.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s persistence is paying off so far, as she overtakes Joe Biden in new Iowa pollSenator Elizabeth Warren runs to the stage before speaking at the Polk County Democrats\u2019 Steak Fry on Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa.
