I didn't think he was actually going to hurt me.'\n\nCameron alleges that White doused her with gasoline and then used a lighter to put her on fire. The attack left her with injuries and burns covering more than 30 percent of her body.\n\nShe said: 'Just burning pain everywhere. I couldn't see anything through the flames. Just the flames. I couldn't hear anything...It was almost like a complete silence.'\n\nShe described hearing crackling sounds like 'how logs get when they crumble in a fire pit.'\n\nCameron alleges that 29-year-old Jonathon White (pictured) attempted to murder her outside a Tim Hortons in Tonawanda\n\nWhite's second-degree murder charge will depend on whether jurors believe setting Cameron on fire was intentional or not\n\nCameron reportedly tried to remove her burning clothes before she was eventually drenched in water by a witness.\n\nCourt evidence showed images of her without clothes as first responders tended to her.\n\nBoth Cameron and White were taken to the Erie County Medical Center to receive treatment, but Cameron would be placed in a medically induced coma until mid-January and discharged five months later.\n\nDuring that time Cameron was underwent 12 surgeries - which included amputations of several of her damaged fingers. She also had to relearn how to open her eyes and mouth, and relearn how to walk.\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers for White, aged 29, have given a very different account, claiming that he never meant to hurt Cameron.\n\nHis testimony goes against officers who took the stand and said White admitted to the crime when they responded to the scene.\n\n'Yeah I caught her on fire. Arrest me,' he allegedly said.\n\nOn Thursday, White testified he had depression and was suicidal during the couple's relationship.\n\nBefore and after: A picture of Cameron before her burns posted on her support page (left) and photos from this week in trial (right)\n\nHe admitted to drinking heavily during this time and using pills, which became a source of tension in their relationship.\n\nHe reportedly tried to kill himself several times while they were together and wanted Cameron to see him die by arson.\n\nHe told jurors the he and Cameron struggled over the gasoline bottle on that snowy afternoon before he poured the liquid on himself.\n\nThe cold temperature of the gasoline allegedly made him freeze up and, in doing so, accidentally sparked the lighter in his hand.\n\n'I don't know what happened to initiate her catching fire,' he said.\n\nPictured: a Facebook photo of Cameron in April 2018, around eight months before she suffered severe burns\n\nSurveillance footage shows White rolling in the snow to extinguish the fire on his body, but Jessica was unable to do so.\n\nHe then attempted to smother the flames by putting snow on her, but when that failed he ran into the Tim Hortons and got a fire extinguisher.\n\nWhite told the courtroom he had been placed in a medically induced coma for two days and had no memories of the event.\n\nHe said: 'I didn't have a total recollection of the incident.'\n\nWhite had one surgery and lost part of his ear.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Rebecca Schnirel said despite White's claims that he was trying to kill himself, he did far more damage to Cameron.\n\nCameron: 'Just burning pain everywhere. I couldn't see anything through the flames. Just the flames. I couldn't hear anything...It was almost like a complete silence'\n\n'You didn't do a very good job of trying to kill yourself. You did a much better job of almost killing Jessica,' she said.\n\nCameron and White's relationship began when she was in high school before eventually moving into together and at one point getting engaged.\n\nShe had their first child at 18, but would later give that child up for adoption and have three other children.\n\nDuring the summer of 2018, both parties say their relationship had deteriorated and their home life became strained.\n\nCameron reportedly ended their relationship around that time, but White allegedly had trouble letting go.\n\nShe and the children moved out of the couple's shared apartment soon after.\n\nPictured: Police bodycam footage of White (middle) after both he and Cameron caught fire\n\nPictured: Authorities outside the Tim Hortons where White and Cameron caught fire in 2018\n\nCameron testified that White was violent with her throughout their relationship.\n\nShe recounted an incident during her senior prom when the couple began arguing over text, causing her to leave the event early and go home.\n\nCameron alleges that White locked her inside her room, pushed her onto the bed, cut her legs and smeared blood across her body.\n\nShe told jurors that White told her 'told me it was my fault.'\n\nAuthorities say they responded to a domestic report involving Cameron and White shortly before violent episode.\n\nThe horrifying incident that sparked this trial happened on December 17, 2018 around 3.30pm.\n\nWhite, who worked the truck at Tim Hortons, messaged Cameron to meet him outside near a dumpster during her work shift.\n\nAs a result of the incident, Cameron (pictured) suffered burns covering more than 30 percent of her body and stayed in the hospital for five months\n\nPrior to this meeting, White says he was on video call with Cameron and the children when his phone died.\n\nHe decided to go visit Cameron because he wanted to see her one last time.\n\nThe two were reportedly talking during a cigarette break when White confronted Cameron about a coworker he believed she was romantically involved in and about their children.\n\nThis led to an argument and to White pulling out a water bottle full of gasoline.\n\nPeter Thompson, a maintenance worker at Tim Hortons and the first witness on the stand, told jurors he was outside when the incident happened.\n\nHe described hearing a 'blood curdling scream' and going to see where it came from.\n\nWhen he saw Cameron engulfed in flames, he ran inside the coffee shop and came out with water to save her.\n\nAuthorities arrived and treated both parties with medical services.\n\nWhite was charged with murder in the second degree.", "description": "Jonathon White has been found guilty of attempted murder and assault for pouring gasoline on his ex-girlfriend, Jessica Cameron, and setting her on fire at a Tim Hortons in Tonawanda, New York", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20184304-0-image-a-59_1572017128781.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
