They stopped in front of the Washington home of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court. The protest, called \u201cReclaim the Court,\u201d was led by civil rights groups like Planned Parenthood Action, the Center for Popular Democracy, and the Women\u2019s March, and was meant to mark the first anniversary of Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court, and came on the heels of new reporting that lends corroboration to accusations of sexual assault by the Justice and provides greater evidence that he lied under oath at his confirmation hearings, charges which he has denied.\n\nProtestors carried signs that said \u201cKAVA-NOPE\u201d and \u201cSUPREMELY CORRUPT.\u201d A sister demonstration took place in Portland, Maine, where constituents expressed pointed displeasure at Senator Susan Collins, who voted to confirm Kavanaugh last year. At a podium on the Court steps in DC, protestors called on House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to initiate impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, as he previously promised to do if Democrats won the House in the 2018 midterms. There was palpable rage at the appointment of Kavanaugh, whose presence on the Court symbolized the persistence of two great threats to women\u2019s full citizenship and bodily autonomy: sexual assault and the erosion of abortion and contraception rights. Chants rose up of \u201cMy body, my choice.\u201d A sign raised towards the Court fa\u00e7ade read, \u201cBELIEVE SURVIVORS.\u201d The demonstrators felt that the Court has the power to make life-altering decisions about the rights and freedoms of women, and that Kavanaugh\u2019s presence there indicated that they would not choose well.\n\nBut the protesters\u2019 anger at the court went beyond Kavanaugh himself, and beyond, even, the insult to women\u2019s dignity and threat to women\u2019s rights that the man represents. Representative Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusettes, told the crowd, \u201cKavanaugh may have that seat (for now), but what we are fighting for is so much bigger than one insecure man blinded by his privilege.\u201d The protesters see Kavanaugh as only the most egregious symptom of a court system that is gravely diseased. Their action speaks to a growing liberal agitation around the judiciary, led by feminists, that is poised to change the politics of the courts.\n\nTraditionally, it was only the right that cared about the judiciary. Republicans ran on promises to appoint judges that would uphold conservative social values, and oppose abortion and gay rights. Those judges in turn enshrined the legality of gerrymandering, curtailed voting rights, and opened the floodgates of unlimited corporate money in politics, interventions which have enabled the Republican party to maintain power even in districts where they have only a minority of popular support. The result became cyclical: Republicans won by promising to appoint conservative judges, and then those conservative judges issued decisions that helped more Republicans win.\n\nTo the left, the judiciary had often been more of an afterthought. Conventional wisdom held that the judiciary could not be counted on as a motivating issue for Democrats the same way that it could for Republicans. But the Kavanaugh appointment brought a new sense of urgency to the matter; the Court\u2019s new conservative majority, and the spectacle of the emotional Senate confirmation hearings through which Republicans secured this majority, galvanized the attention of a Democratic base that increasingly feels that its basic civil rights are imperiled under a federal judiciary packed with Trump appointees and a Supreme Court controlled by Trump allies.\n\nThere is some evidence that this concern expands well beyond the activist left: in September, a poll conducted by the firm Perry Undem found that a full 60% of Americans thought it likely that Brett Kavanaugh committed perjury during his confirmation hearings, a figure that suggests that popular support for impeaching the Justice may be easy for Democrats to come by. Support for abortion rights is even higher, meaning that the Supreme Court, which is poised to issue the first assault on abortion of its new conservative majority just before the next presidential election, is not only comprised of justices that the people do not trust, but is also likely to hand down opinions that the people do not want.\n\nAnd this is the problem with the Supreme Court: it is a profoundly un-democratic institution, and has only been made more so by the right\u2019s determination to politicize the court and to manipulate it into helping them secure a policy agenda that runs counter to popular will. The gross injustice of the Kavanaugh confirmation made Americans\u2014and feminists in particular\u2014more aware of the urgency of the problem, and less accepting of its inevitability.\n\nNow, every major Democratic presidential contender must be able to answer tough questions about how they will reform the courts; several, including California Senator Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have joined the call for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. Some of the court reform proposals that have emerged from the Democratic field have been halting or insufficient, paying undue deference to a myth of an apolitical court. Others have been more aggressive, more willing to treat the Court as the political institution that Republicans have long treated it as.\n\nAt any rate, the Democratic base wants answers: it is no longer acceptable for the party to be as passive and accepting of Republican aggression regarding the judiciary as its once was. In Portland, Maine, a small child carried a sign to the protest: \u201cFAIR COURTS FOR MY FUTURE.\u201d Beside him, an older woman was even more pointed: \u201cCONSERVATIVE JUDGES ERODE FREEDOMS FOR ALL.\u201d", "description": "The Democratic base is tired of the party being passive about Republicans packing the judiciary.
