In the first year, the official line was that the dispute would not damage the Chinese economy and that the main victims would be American companies.\n\nAs China's economic slowdown has become more entrenched, the new slogan is that there are no winners in trade and technology wars.\n\nLast month, its top diplomat, Wang Yi, warned that tariffs and technology disputes could plunge the world into recession.\n\n\"Tariffs and provocation of trade disputes, which upset global industrial and supply chains, serve to undermine the multilateral trade regime and global economic trade order\", he said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also appears that losing access to critical technology is of greater concern to Beijing than rising tariffs.\n\nThis month, the nationalist Chinese tabloid Global Times \u2013 which is published by the Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece, the People's Daily \u2013 said there was \"nothing to be gained from erecting digital versions of the Berlin Wall\".\n\nIt said a \"win-win cooperation should be the aim of all major technology-producing nations\".\n\nAmbitious growth targets.\n\nAt the top level of the Chinese hierarchy, there is a growing recognition of the challenge of meeting ambitious growth targets.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang admitted last month that it was \"very difficult\" for China's economy to grow at a rate of 6 per cent or more, because of slowing global growth and rising protectionism.\n\nBeijing had set a target for the world's second-largest economy to grow by between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent this year. According to Chinese officials, it grew 6.2 per cent between April and June compared with a year earlier, its slowest pace in nearly three decades.\n\nEconomists expect Chinese growth to slip below 6 per cent in the coming months as the escalating trade war saps confidence, causing businesses to scale back their investment plans.\n\nThis leaves Beijing with a difficult trade-off. If Chinese policymakers encourage businesses and local governments to borrow and invest more to boost growth, they risk injecting yet more instability into the country's financial system.", "description": "Aussie investors had hoped they could avoid becoming collateral damage in the US-China trade war.
