With easier entry, better mobility and improved communications, these won\u2019t be nearly as clumsy or restrictive \u2014 though you still wouldn\u2019t want to wear one around the house.\n\nThe new spacesuit, known as the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit or xEMU, is still deep in development, but its features have been more or less finalized. It\u2019s already being tested underwater, and orbital testing is scheduled for 2023.\n\nRather than build something completely new from the ground up, NASA engineers decided to address the (sometimes literal) pain points of a previous, proven design. As such, the new suit superficially resembles the ones in which we saw moonwalkers bunny-hopping around the lunar surface. But that\u2019s because the basic design for a suit that protects you from hard vacuum and cosmic radiation is relatively straightforward.\n\nIn NASA\u2019s words, a spacesuit is \u201ca personalized spaceship that mimics all of the protections from the harsh environment of space and the basic resources that Earth and its atmosphere provide.\u201d There\u2019s only so much wiggle room there.\n\nBut while some parts may not have changed much since the old days, others are getting major improvements. First and foremost, both for safety and mission purposes, maneuverability has been upgraded in tons of ways.\n\nFor one thing, there are altogether new joints and better ranges of motion for existing ones. The standard \u201castronaut stance\u201d indicative of the inflexibility of the Apollo suits should be all but eliminated with the new freedoms afforded xEMU users. Not only will the normal range of motion be easier, but astronauts will be able to reach across their own torso or lift something clear over their head.\n\nMore flexible knees and \u201chiking-style\u201d boots with flexible soles will make crouching and getting up much easier as well. It\u2019s hard to believe we got this far without those basic capabilities.\n\nThe fit of the suits will be vastly better as well; NASA is using anthropometry, or 3D scanning of the body, to determine exactly which pieces and fits will be best for a given astronaut.\n\nSpeaking of which, much of the suit will be made from easily swappable, modular parts. The lower half can be switched out when doing an orbital EVA versus a surface EVA, for instance. And the helmet\u2019s visor has a \u201csacrificial\u201d protective layer that can easily be replaced with a new one if it gets damaged.\n\nInside the helmet, the familiar but apparently widely disliked \u201cSnoopy caps\u201d that housed microphones and such are gone, replaced by modern voice-activated mics and headphones that will produce much better audio quality and much less sweat.\n\nFor that matter, the entire communications stack has been replaced with a new HD camera and lights, connected by a high-speed wireless data link. Live video from the Moon may be old hat, but it\u2019s going to be a bit different from that grainy black-and-white business in 1969.\n\nOne of the most important new features is rear entry. The awkward process of donning an old-style EVA suit requires a good deal of space and help. The new ones are entered via a hatch on the back, allowing more natural placement of arm hinges and other features, and possibly changing how the suits are mounted. One can easily imagine a suit acting as a sort of airlock: you climb in the back, it seals you in, and you walk right out into space. Well, there\u2019d probably be more to it than that, but the rear-entry hatch could facilitate some cool stuff along those lines.\n\nAlthough NASA is designing and certifying these suits, it may not actually make them itself. The agency called last week for input on how it might best source spacesuits from the commercial space industry.\n\nThat\u2019s part of NASA\u2019s decision to rely increasingly on contractors and private industry to support its 2024 Moon ambitions. Of course, contractors were an essential part of the Apollo program as well, but NASA is now giving them much more leeway and may even use private launch services.\n\nYou can keep up with the latest NASA spacesuit news here, of course, or at the agency\u2019s SuitUp tag.", "description": "The next Americans to set foot on the Moon will do so in a brand new spacesuit that's based on, but hugely improved from, the original Apollo suits that last went up there in the '70s.
