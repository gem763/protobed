Critics of the move say Trump capitulated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and abandoned Kurdish allies in the region who have been key partners in the fight against Islamic State militants but are enemies of the Turks.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, Trump announced via Twitter that the U.S. had taken custody of two high-profile ISIS detainees being held in the region \u201cin case the Kurds or Turkey lose control.\u201d\n\nTrump said the U.S. removed the pair, known for brutal beheadings in Syria and sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Beatles,\u201d from the country and took them to a secure location. \u201cThey are the worst of the worst!\u201d he added.\n\nTrump has also sought to placate fears that Turkey would decimate the Kurds in northern Syria, issuing a number of public warnings to Turkey as the incursion began, appearing to endorse the idea of potentially sanctioning the country and announcing he remains in communication \u201cwith both sides.\u201d He'd previously threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate\" the Turkish economy if Turkish troops did anything he deemed \"off limits.\"\n\n\u201cTurkey has been planning to attack the Kurds for a long time,\u201d he acknowledged in a tweet on Thursday, again contending that withdrawing U.S. troops allowed him to fulfill his campaign promise of wrapping up \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to the area and start a new war all over again,\u201d he continued. \u201cTurkey is a member of NATO. Others say STAY OUT, let the Kurds fight their own battles (even with our financial help). I say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don\u2019t play by the rules! I am watching closely.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/ee/13926d1c423b801f0b3db576de45/191010-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
