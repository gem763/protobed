(Matt Slocum/AP)\n\nThe Washington Nationals made seven additions to their active roster Sunday morning, with September expansion giving them a chance to pad their bullpen, bench and even rotation depth.\n\nThey started by activating four players \u2014 Sean Doolittle, Ryan Zimmerman, Austin Voth and Jeremy Hellickson \u2014 from the injured list. Then they recalled three others from the minor leagues, bringing up catcher Raudy Read, infielder Adri\u00e1n Sanchez and outfielder Andrew Stevenson. Manager Dave Martinez did not rule out more additions in the coming days and weeks. But for the time being, he has 32 players at his disposal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens; there are still some guys that are playing down there,\u201d Martinez said Sunday. \u201cFor now, these are the guys we got. A couple arms in the bullpen, an extra catcher. Sanchez and Stevenson, which I believe they both deserve to be here; they can help us out in the infield, outfield, pinch-hit. For right now, we\u2019re good.\u201d\n\n[Schedule analysis of National League contenders reveals possible playoff picture for Nationals]\n\nPlaying time and roles will vary among the seven players. Ryan Zimmerman, hurt for all but 33 games this season, will play some against lefties and otherwise come off the bench. He is in the lineup to face the Miami Marlins and left-hander Caleb Smith at 1:35 p.m. on Sunday, the 14th anniversary of his major league debut. Doolittle went to the IL in mid-August with right knee tendinitis after arm fatigue led to poor results. He will not be the closer for now, both he and Martinez confirmed Sunday, but he expects to work back to that spot down the stretch.\n\nAfter that, Voth and Hellickson will be long men in the bullpen and spot starters if needed. The Nationals already have Erick Fedde as a sixth option in the rotation behind Joe Ross. They came into the month with an open spot on their 40-man roster, and it seemed as if they\u2019would use it to add a reliever. Greg Holland or Aaron Barrett felt like logical options. But they instead decided to activate Hellickson off the 60-day IL, where he has been since mid-May, in case they need length. The Nationals could open another 40-man roster spot by placing Austen Williams, who has been sidelined since late April with a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder, on the 60-day IL.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a couple guys like that at this time,\u201d Martinez said of Hellickson and Voth, though he did hint that Voth could be used in other situations. \u201cIf we\u2019re winning by a lot or losing by a lot, these guys can fill out some innings.\u201d\n\nOf the remaining healthy players on the 40-man roster, here is who didn\u2019t get called up Sunday: outfielder Michael A. Taylor, infielder Wilmer Difo, pitcher Kyle McGowin, reliever James Bourque, catcher Spencer Kieboom, shortstop Carter Kieboom and infielder Jake Noll. They still have eight open spots if they want to add more players.\n\nTaylor has been a major leaguer for most of the past four seasons, but he was demoted earlier this year. Spencer Kieboom was the backup catcher for much of last season but can\u2019t be recalled until next Sunday at the earliest because of a recent stint with the Nationals. Carter Kieboom, Washington\u2019s top prospect and Spencer\u2019s younger brother, was up earlier this year and struggled in 11 games. But September call-up or not, the younger Kieboom is an integral part of the Nationals\u2019 long-term plans.\n\nAdding Read, Stevenson and Sanchez could give Martinez bench flexibility that he lacked for the first four or so months of the season. He is still unlikely to give Trea Turner, Antony Rendon or Juan Soto days off. But he may be more inclined to use a pinch runner \u2014 Stevenson is fast on the bases \u2014 or late-game defensive subs for Adam Eaton in the outfield or possibly at second or first base. He also can more comfortably use catcher Kurt Suzuki as a pinch hitter on days he\u2019s not in the lineup because Read provides insurance if Yan Gomes has to be removed from the game.\n\nThe Nationals entered Sunday with a 3 1/2-game lead for the top spot in the National League wild-card race. They have a seven-game cushion for the second wild-card spot and trail the Atlanta Braves by 5 1/2 in the NL East. They have 28 games left to both hold off a number of teams and try to claw back in the division. And now they have seven more players to help them do that.\n\nLINEUPS\n\nMarlins (48-87)\n\nMiguel Rojas SS\n\nHarold Ramirez RF\n\nGarrett Cooper 1B\n\nStarlin Castro 2B\n\nMartin Prado 3B\n\nLewis Brinson CF\n\nAustin Dean LF\n\nBryan Holaday C\n\nCaleb Smith P\n\nNationals (76-58)\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nYan Gomes C\n\nGerardo Parra RF\n\nPatrick Corbin P\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nGame 2 against the Marlins: Stephen Strasburg is dominant, and Nats hit September on a roll\n\nGame 1: Nationals not at their best, but it\u2019s good enough to beat the Marlins\n\nBatting practice pitcher Ali Modami is the Nationals\u2019 secret good luck charm\n\nEven during the nonstop MLB season, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez is with his kids as much as possible", "description": "Washington activated four players off the injured list and recalled three others from the minor leagues.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-oyLhWiRcvFqRWaOeoHTskBJaMc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YW7YL2VMY4I6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg"}
