It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nIt concluded: \u201cI will call you later.\u201d\n\nThe language in the letter was so unpresidential that when it leaked, there were doubts it could be genuine. Even Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a press conference that it was \u201chighly unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't often encounter such language in correspondence between heads of state,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the White House confirmed it was legitimate.\n\nOn Thursday, Turkish officials said Erdogan had responded to Trump\u2019s letter by throwing it in the trash.\n\n\u201cThe date on the letter is 9 October, the same day we began Operation Peace Spring,\u201d one official told Middle East Eye. \u201cOur president gave the best response by launching the operation on the same day at 4pm.\u201d\n\nThe letters\u2019 threatening tone has caused outrage in Turkey at a sensitive time, as Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hold emergency talks with Turkish officials to try to persuade them to halt the invasion. Former Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davotoglu tweeted that \u201cthe Turkish nation and state were offended\u201d by Trump\u2019s letter, and said all meetings with U.S. officials should be cancelled in response.\n\nAhead of the talks Thursday, a Turkish official told Reuters that negotiating with the Kurds or halting the military operation were \u201cnot on the agenda.\u201d Erdogan signalled Wednesday that he wouldn\u2019t be dissuaded, telling Turkish lawmakers in he would not halt unless Kurdish fighters \u201clay down their arms ... destroy all their traps and get out of the safe zone that we have designated.\u201d\n\nREAD: Turkey warns U.S. not to interfere with Syria invasion\n\nTrump has vigorously defended his call to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, which critics \u2014 including many from his own party \u2014 say effectively gave Turkey a greenlight to invade.\n\nThe offensive, now in its ninth day, has unleashed brutal violence on the Kurds, a key ground partner in the fight against ISIS. It has also ceded influence in the Syrian conflict to the Assad regime and its Russian backers, and threatened to lead to the release of thousands of Islamic State fighters in Kurdish custody.\n\nDespite his ongoing efforts to get Erdogan to call off the offensive, which has created a humanitarian crisis for the 160,000 civilians who have fled their homes, Trump boasted Wednesday that his troop withdrawal was \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d\n\n\"It's not our border. We shouldn't be losing lives over it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur soldiers are totally safe.\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump is scrambling to undo the chaos he unleashed in northern Syria\n\nBut that didn\u2019t wash with U.S. lawmakers. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an ally of the president, slammed Trump for his comments, which he said \u201ccompletely undercut\u201d Pence\u2019s negotiating position in Ankara.\n\nAnd in a rare bipartisan rebuke, 129 Republicans in the House of Representatives joined Democrats to broadly condemn Trump\u2019s troop withdrawal, and call on Erdogan to immediately cease the operation against the Kurds.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds is as incoherent as it is dangerous\n\nAs fighting entered its ninth day along the Syria-Turkey border, Kurdish authorities called for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from Ras al-Ain, a key border town under heavy Turkish assault. Meanwhile, the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad rolled into the strategic border town of Kobane after striking a deal with the Kurds to help them repel the Turkish aggression.\n\nCover: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses his ruling party legislators at the Parliament, in Ankara, Wednesday, Oct 16, 2019.
