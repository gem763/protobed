The set of provisions enjoys wide, bipartisan support, so it\u2019s likely to pass sooner rather than later. These rule changes may at first seem like a big change, but taking a wider view, they probably won't have much of an impact.\n\nCongress is making this change to how heirs must take distributions (and ultimately pay taxes) on Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s because lawmakers needed to find revenue to offset the costs of other provisions in the SECURE Act. Right now, most heirs who inherit a Traditional IRA or other defined contribution account get a huge tax break because they only need to take distributions based on their life expectancy. For example, if a 40-year old inherits an IRA, his required minimum distribution is just 2.29% at the end of the year, based on his 43.6-year life expectancy. Obviously, this gives him the ability to shield his inherited IRA from taxes for a long time.", "description": "Congress\u2019 next \u201cpay-for\u201d is not as significant as it seems at first glance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt82be987fd176accb/5cf5932bd8bbe50306d29a7c/Saving_1x1.svg"}
