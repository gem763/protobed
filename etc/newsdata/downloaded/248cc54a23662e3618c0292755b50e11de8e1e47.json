Lemon juice or vinegar for the marinade? Here\u2019s the definitive way to make this Greek version of kebab\n\nSouvlaki\u2019s name derives from the medieval Greek for skewer, but grilling meat on sticks was a practice taken from the Muslim cooks of the near east. As the Oxford Companion to Food notes, these days they\u2019re often made of \u201cun-Islamic pork\u201d. Often, but not always, you will find chicken and lamb versions (indeed, in Australia, where post-pub souvas are an institution, lamb is apparently the default).\n\nBut the consensus on Twitter seems to be that pork is the classic iteration in souvlaki\u2019s homeland, albeit consumed in very different ways depending on where you are \u2013 wrapped in bread or on a plate; on its own or with chips, salad, onions, pickles, herbs, and a whole array of sauces; or simply eaten straight from a pointy piece of wood by the side of the road. But what\u2019s the best way to make it at home?\n\nThe meat\n\nThe two most common cuts used in the souvlaki recipes I try are tenderloin (generally called fillet in this country), or neck and shoulder. The latter, Belinda Harley notes in her book Roast Lamb in the Olive Groves, should have a little fat left on \u201cso that it doesn\u2019t dry out\u201d. As a devotee of the fat-means-flavour school of thought, I expect that the well-marbled shoulder I try will be far superior to the lean fillet, and that the pork belly used by Tonia Buxton in the Real Greek Cookbook will be better still. But we decide that, cooked quickly on a high heat, the tenderness of the fillet wins us over. That said, there\u2019s little to beat the taste of good-quality chargrilled pork fat, so I\u2019ve decided to use a combination of shoulder and fillet; belly is a little too rich, even for us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Belinda Harley\u2019s souvlaki makes use of \u2018country bread\u2019. Thumbnails: Felicity Cloake.\n\nHarley cuts the meat into very small pieces for her mini kebabs, but if you keep them a little larger, they\u2019ll stay juicier during cooking.\n\nThe marinade\n\nThe simplest marinades come from Harley and Tessa Kiros\u2019 Falling Cloudberries: lemon juice, oregano, and olive oil, with bay leaves in Harley\u2019s too. Georgina Hayden\u2019s Taverna, which celebrates the food of her Greek Cypriot family, uses garlic, fresh rosemary and thyme, with red-wine vinegar instead of the lemon juice. Greek celebrity chef Akis Petretzikis uses white wine vinegar and garlic along with olive oil and oregano. (He also sticks in a chicken stock cube, giving the meat a deliciously savoury quality \u2013 though I\u2019d prefer to let salt do the seasoning, and the pork speak for itself.\n\nBuxton\u2019s recipe, as used at the Real Greek chain, is quite a different beast: the sticky, aromatic marinade of orange juice, honey, mustard, paprika, cinnamon and fennel seeds reminds us (not unhappily) of Chinese roast pork rather than souvlaki. This comparison is encouraged by the fact it\u2019s cooked in the oven, rather than on a grill, and so lacks the char that, my testers say, is vital for transportation-back-to-Greece purposes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tonia Buxton\u2019s recipe, as used at the Real Greek chain, is sticky and aromatic like Chinese roast pork.\n\nMemories of Greek holidays also prompt my decision to go for dried oregano, rather than Hayden\u2019s fresh herbs, delicious though they are. My guinea pigs, one of whom follows a largely vegetarian diet, rate them as more interesting, but say the oregano is the thing that sings to them of Greece. We all love the garlic though, so I\u2019m going to keep that, and use lemon juice rather than vinegar as you can squeeze the other half over the salad.\n\nSome recipes, including Kiros\u2019, brush the marinade on the meat just before cooking, but you\u2019ll get more flavour if you leave them to mingle for a little longer \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t recommend more than three or four hours though, lest the acid in the lemon juice begins to toughen the meat.\n\nThe accompaniments\n\nHayden gives two serving suggestions for her souvlaki: \u201cThe more traditional Greek way, with round fluffy pitta breads, chips and mustard sauce\u201d and \u201cthe Cypriot way: in oval pitta breads, with shredded cabbage and griddled olives\u201d.\n\nIntrigued by the mayonnaise-based mustard sauce, and tempted by the chips, I opt for the former, but her creamy tzatziki is so very good that most testers opt for that instead. \u201cI\u2019d have to alternate,\u201d the lapsing vegetarian says through a mouthful of meat, \u201cI can\u2019t taste them both together.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Akis Petretzikis is the only one to add vegetables to the skewers themselves.\n\nPetretzikis is the only one to add vegetables to the skewers themselves, in the form of red onions and peppers. They are a good combination with the charred pork \u2013 \u201clike a home barbecue from the 80s!\u201d Martha says joyfully \u2013 but are very much an optional extra. It\u2019s easier, I think, to serve the skewers with a tomato salad, perhaps with some thinly sliced red onion and chopped parsley, as most recipes recommend. (Like Kiros, I prefer to soak my onions for a milder flavour, but if you\u2019re less of a wimp, feel free to ignore this step.)\n\nChips are, of course, always a possibility, but bread is a must. Oval Arabic pitta are the most widely available here, but if you\u2019re lucky enough to have access to a shop selling fluffier, round flatbreads (I got mine from a Turkish greengrocers), they\u2019re much easier to roll up around the meat, and better at soaking up the juices too. Or, if you\u2019re more of a sourdough sort, Harley suggests using slices of \u201ccountry bread\u201d as a plate.\n\nI\u2019ll leave the last word on souvlaki to Hayden, a woman practically weaned on them: \u201cBe sure to finish with a sprinkle of paprika\u201d.\n\nPrep 30 min\n\nSoak 20 min\n\nCook 15 min\n\nMakes 4\n\nFor the skewers\n\n600g pork tenderloin\n\n200g pork shoulder\n\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n\n100ml olive oil\n\nJuice of \u00bd lemon\n\n1 tbsp dried oregano\n\n\u00bd tsp fine salt\n\nTo serve\n\n\u00bd red onion, peeled\n\n4 large tomatoes\n\nJuice of \u00bd lemon\n\n1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped\n\n4 flatbreads\n\n200g tzatziki\n\n1 pinch paprika\n\nCut the tenderloin and shoulder into cubes of roughly 2x3cm.

Thread the meat on to the skewers, pushing it together so you can\u2019t see any skewer between the pieces. Griddle on all sides until well browned and cooked through. Meanwhile, warm the flatbreads in another hot pan or a low oven.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thread the marinated meat on to skewers and griddle.\n\nSprinkle the skewers with paprika and serve with salad, tzatziki and bread.\n\nDoes souvlaki mean pork, chicken or lamb to you \u2013 or something even more exotic?
