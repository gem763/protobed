Or possibly both.\u201d\n\nAll others should find plenty of solace in \u201cHigh School,\u201d a coming-of-age memoir from Canadian musicians, twin sisters and LGBTQ icons Tegan and Sara Quin. A sort of anti-yearbook, it\u2019s not likely to make anyone nostalgic for their teen years.\n\nWritten by the sisters in alternating chapters, the book is divided into three sections \u2014 Grade 10, Grade 11 and Grade 12 \u2014 and details their teenage years and discovery of rave and grunge in the mid-90s.\n\nTheir upbringing in the suburbs of northeast Calgary, where temperatures can hit minus-20 degrees in winter, was fairly drab. Born in 1980 to childhood sweethearts who split when the sisters were in first grade, the girls lived mostly with their mom, Sonia, a plucky activist and mental health worker who worked long shifts. This meant, as Tegan puts it, that \u201cSara and I were free to kick the,\u201d well, you know, \u201cout of each other without a referee.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, Sonia and the girls move in with Bruce, a handsome, Camaro-driving hockey-playing construction manager who becomes a kind of stepfather and emerges in the book as a caring, endearingly complicated hero.\n\nThe Quins are skilled writers with an eye for detail. Here\u2019s Sara describing the scene as Bruce ferries them to school in his pickup truck: \u201cThe silver wrappers from the Wendy\u2019s burgers he ate daily were balled up near the pedals on the floor. The dashboard and seats were dusted with grit from the construction sites he managed, and the whole car smelled of onions and his musky cologne.\u201d\n\n\n\nTegan and Sara celebrating their 17th birthday.

As acrimonious as their relationship could be, there was also an inexorable need. \u201cWe fought, mercilessly, for time alone,\u201d Tegan writes, \u201cbut I still felt a primal fear of being apart from her.\u201d They discover acid (they very matter-of-factly did a ton of drugs). They hit the mall. They brawl over whose turn it is to use the computer as the dial-up modem sputters to life, one of many amusing \u201990s-era details.\n\nAnd both begin to realize, even if they can\u2019t yet put it into words, that they are attracted to girls. Tegan attempts to date a guy named Spencer. (\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this feel right?\u201d she keeps asking herself.) Meanwhile, Sara writes secret letters to her crushes. (\u201cIt was still a shock to feel desire for girls, addictive thoughts that stole hours of my time at school and in bed before I fell asleep.\u201d)\n\nWhen she finally kisses her friend Naomi, she feels so much inner turmoil that she runs to the bathroom to throw up, terrified of revealing her sexuality in a place, and era, that isn\u2019t particularly queer-friendly.\n\nMusic becomes their salvation. Sara discovers Smashing Pumpkins and howls along to the lyrics, imagining that a crowd, replete with her junior high bullies, is watching her. In 10th grade, the sisters unearth a guitar that Bruce has stashed under the stairs. They steal off to teach themselves to play (Tegan studying music videos of Courtney Love and mimicking how she holds her hands). \u201cSlowly, I was able to start holding power chords that didn\u2019t sound half bad,\u201d she writes.\n\nEventually, Sara starts singing along, and writes their very first song, \u201cTegan Didn\u2019t Go to School Today.\u201d Their fate is sealed when their mom buys them an electric guitar on their 16th birthday.\n\nIn 12th grade, they enter a contest called Garage Warz. The prize is gigs and studio time. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win tonight, our mom is going to make us go to college,\u201d Tegan announces to the judges. They win. Their fans know what followed: a million albums sold, a Grammy nomination, their emergence as outspoken advocates for LGBTQ rights.\n\n\n\nTegan and Sara performing in the Garage Warz semifinals. (Courtesy of the authors)\n\nBy the book\u2019s end, the reader is nearly as eager to leave high school as they are. This is not a knock. They write so viscerally about the mundaneness and despair and occasional highs, chemical and otherwise, of being a teen that it revived, for me, some long-buried memories I had hoped to leave behind forever.\n\n\u201cHigh School\u201d has the immediacy and intimacy of a diary, but it also suffers from the stream-of-consciousness verbosity of the form: a litany of drugs, crushes on girls, raucous parties at the pot-smoke-clouded house of an older dude named Rick.\n\nAnd while the book adeptly captures the searing pain of being a teenager, the sisters don\u2019t offer any insight as adults. Why did they do so many drugs, for instance? \u201cTeenage boredom\u201d and \u201cCalgary winters\u201d seem like reasonable explanations, but it would have been enlightening to hear it from them.\n\nThe most powerful moment in \u201cHigh School\u201d comes as they confront their sexuality. Sara writes movingly of realizing that she is gay. In a flood of tears after her first girlfriend leaves her, she stands at her bedroom window and looks at the moon. I\u2019m gay, she thinks for the first time. \u201cFrom that night forward, I carried the words in my mouth,\u201d she writes, \u201ctempted to tell everyone and no one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh School\u201d reminds us that even one compassionate adult can have an outsize effect on a teen struggling with their sexuality. When a boy in Sara\u2019s sex education class asserts that only gay people get AIDS, she flees the class, sobbing, and blindly runs to her sympathetic drama teacher, Mr. Russel, who immediately takes charge. Afterward, when she thanks him, she writes, \u201cI found that I couldn\u2019t quite meet his eyes. I wanted to tell him that I knew he was gay, and that I probably was, too. But I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHis instinctive rush to protect her is one of the book\u2019s most dramatic scenes. It\u2019s been nearly a quarter-century since then. Maybe Mr. Russel doesn\u2019t even remember his act of kindness that day. But Sara does.\n\nJancee Dunn\u2019s most recent book is \u201cHow Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids.\u201d", "description": "In alternating chapters, the twin musicians look back at their tumultuous teen years.", "authors": ["Jancee Dunn", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mf77wysQOK16kmPNsWJYnNGeT0c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MHW75EGVUEI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
