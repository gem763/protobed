But what I really mean is: Think before you speak \u2014 what you\u2019re about to say could hurt someone\u2019s feelings.\n\nThinking before one speaks is a skill that most of us will hone all our lives, some with more success than others. And when the words themselves are typed, rather than spoken, it can add another layer of disconnection to their impact.\n\nMy son is still at the age where he\u2019s speaking almost all of his conversations, rather than texting or messaging or posting. But I know those days are ahead, and for a generation of kids who will communicate with each other less in person and more online, we might need to adjust our advice: Think before you type, and speak before you \u201csend.\u201d\n\nKatie Hurley, a child and adolescent psychotherapist and parenting educator, writes for the Washington Post that parents can help their teenagers learn to be mindful of how their quips and responses affect others:\n\nOne thing I see over and over when students share texts and social media interactions with me is a stark lack of empathy and compassion behind the screen. Groups of kids target another kid without stopping to think about how their comments might affect the person on the other end. For many kids, even just one or two comments can be devastating.\n\nThink before you type, and speak before you \u201csend.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, kids ganging up on each other and showing a lack of empathy for their words and actions isn\u2019t exactly a new phenomenon, and it can\u2019t be blamed entirely on smartphones and social media. But clinical psychologist and author John Duffy tells the Post that \u201cit\u2019s far easier to communicate free of compassion and empathy when you are not looking someone in the eye, when you are not in their presence.\u201d\n\nIt makes sense. Think of how many times you have read a tweet or a comment on a news article \u2014 from a supposedly grown, mature adult \u2014 and thought, \u201cyou\u2019d never have the nerve to say that to someone\u2019s face.\u201d It\u2019s not just that we feel emboldened by the anonymity. We also feel more emotionally detached to the written words. It\u2019s no wonder that teenagers do, too.\n\nOne way to combat that, Hurley writes, is to teach kids to read their own messages out loud before they hit send. She does this as an actual exercise in her office with some of her teenage patients, taking turns reading messages out loud.\n\nWhen they hand me the phone to read the conversations back to them, they hear their own words (and things said by their friends) in a real voice. They hear the hurt, the anger, the sadness or the jealousy. They feel the emotions differently. When they read or write the words on a tiny screen, they can use emotional detachment to avoid experiencing the feelings attached to those words. But when we sit back to back, two humans reading texts and posts aloud, they absorb the emotions. When the words are negative, they struggle to read them out loud. But when the words are positive, teens soften a bit.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty unlikely your teens will want to do this little exercise around the dinner table, but you can still encourage them to develop a habit of reading their words out loud before hitting send. For example, when they\u2019re writing a report for school or an email to a boss and they\u2019re struggling with a specific paragraph or section, have them read it aloud to you. Even in less contentious situations like these, they\u2019ll begin to feel the difference between the written and spoken word.\n\nYou can also model this behaviour for them by practicing it yourself. That might sound like this: \u201cHey, I was going to send this message to Aunt Emily about being late again, but now that I\u2019m reading it out loud, it might sound too harsh. What do you think?\u201d\n\nAfter all, it doesn\u2019t hurt for us to develop that habit a little more, too.", "description": "Whenever I start to tell my son, \u201cYour words have power, so...\u201d he finishes my sentence with, \u201c...so choose them wisely, I know.\u201d As a writer, I do put a heavy value on word choice and the beauty of language.
