These books present magic as both good and evil, which is not true, but in fact a clever deception,\" Reehil wrote in an email, which was obtained by The Tennessean.\n\nReehil said that the curses and spells used in the fantasy fiction books \"are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.\"\n\nHe noted that he consulted with several exorcists before making the decision.\n\nSarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\nCalls to Reehil and the Catholic Diocese of Nashville, which oversees the school, were not immediately returned.\n\nSocial media users were quick to poke fun at the school's decision.\n\nI speak from experience when i say there is a VERY low risk of conjuring an evil spirit while reading Harry Potter. 1/63 pic.twitter.com/4a9nqaAs9T \u2014 Emily Roehler (@EmilyRoehler) September 3, 2019\n\nExpelliarmus this idea immediately.
