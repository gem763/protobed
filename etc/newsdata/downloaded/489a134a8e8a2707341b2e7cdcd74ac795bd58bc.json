It\u2019ll only give the box to internet-only subscribers who also rent a modem and router from the company for an additional $13 per month.\n\nAfter the free offer was announced last month, a Comcast spokesperson told me the rental requirement would be dropped \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d so that all internet-only customers could get the device for free. But a month later, that requirement is still in place, and Comcast\u2019s checkout interface has even been updated to emphasize that its streaming box, called Flex, is only included when you rent the company\u2019s modem / router combo, the xFi Gateway.\n\nThe Flex page repeatedly says it\u2019s included at \u201cno extra cost\u201d\n\nThe $13-per-month rental fee for the xFi Gateway is a complete rip-off that Comcast (like other internet providers) pushes on its subscribers because people generally don\u2019t know there\u2019s an alternative. Instead of paying Comcast an additional $13 per month in perpetuity, you can instead buy a modem and router outright. By doing so, you\u2019ll likely make up the upfront costs after a year, maybe two if you go for higher-end options. Once it\u2019s paid off, you\u2019ll be saving the $156 per year that you\u2019re paying just to have a box sit in your house.\n\nSo for Comcast to say that its streaming box \u201cis now included with an Xfinity Internet-only subscription,\u201d that it is \u201cavailable to internet-only customers for free\u201d and that it is included \u201cat no additional cost as part of an Xfinity Internet-only subscription\u201d is misleading if not outright wrong.\n\nThe only place that Comcast clarifies the need for an additional subscription is at the bottom of the website for Flex. That page \u2014 which says in five locations that the box is \u201cnow included\u201d with internet subscriptions or is available to subscribers at \u201cno extra cost\u201d \u2014 notes at the bottom that as part of signing up for new service, you should \u201cselect our xFi Gateway modem + router at checkout.\u201d In fine print, it says a \u201ccompatible xFi Gateway\u201d is required.\n\nThat Comcast would make something \u201cfree\u201d and try to eke extra money out of it perhaps shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. From the start, Comcast\u2019s pricing for the Flex box was absurd: when the streaming box launched in March, it was available to lease for $5 per month. Even after last month\u2019s announcement, additional units are still offered only at that $5-per-month price. With Roku streaming sticks as cheap as $30 flat, there\u2019s no reason to ever rent a streaming box for an endless monthly fee.\n\nComcast didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge\u2019s parent company.", "description": "Comcast made headlines last month when it announced plans to give a free streaming box called Flex to all of its internet-only subscribers \u2014 except, there\u2019s an extra fee that Comcast didn\u2019t clearly disclose at the time.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_w1IhZ0QNqmxoVo8H_A_FXFgcgc=/138x0:1303x610/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15978252/flex2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
