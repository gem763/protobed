Getty\n\nKane and Maddison for England?\n\nThe first half saw two Englishmen star. James Maddison caused absolute havoc for Spur\u2019s defence coming close twice in quick succession. Then up the other end, Harry Kane scored a goal that made no sense given that he more or less in the fetal position when he struck the ball.\n\nImagine what would happen if the pair played for the same team? This is an image that apparently hasn\u2019t entered Gareth Southgate\u2019s mind just yet.\n\nMaddison hasn\u2019t made a senior appearance for England just yet. It\u2019s a mystery as to why, the former Norwich midfielder was beating Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard for chances created at one stage last season. Today he was the decisive player with a sublime finish.\n\nThere\u2019s few players on Earth who benefit more from chance creation than Harry Kane. This may be a simplistic formula, but Maddison and Kane proved today that they are two of England\u2019s most talented players, and would surely benefit from each other on international duty. Go on Gareth, give Maddison a go.\n\nBurnley back to basics\n\nTwo years ago Burnley finished seventh behind a water-tight defence and building a fortress at Turf Moor.\n\nThe Clarets were winless in five and without a clean sheet in that time, yet Sean Dyche\u2019s side rediscovered the formula against Norwich this weekend.\n\nChris Wood\u2019s brace to compliment Ashley Barnes\u2019 hot start could propel Burnley back up to midtable this season, yet more importantly they kept out the Canaries, which should ensure the floor for their finish in the table is comfortably clear of 18th.\n\nCity thrashing presents growing concern\n\nManchester City proved far too much for Watford and exposed the gulf in class between the top two (including Liverpool) and the rest.\n\nWatford were good enough to beat Arsenal last week, who could easily finish third this season.\n\nYet Quique Sanchez Flores\u2019 side were blown away by Pep Guardiola\u2019s lavishly-funded squad, possibly highlighting a growing concern for the league in the years to come.\n\nUnited toothless in attack\n\nSince their 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea on the opening day of the season, United have managed just four goals in five games. They have been nullified, restricted far too easily by most opposition, and that was again the case against West Ham.\n\nIn truth, the Hammers\u2019 back four were largely untroubled, certainly in a tepid, lacklustre first half. There is a lack of creativity, an absence of any ideas in the final third, and that will be a real concern for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who allowed Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez to leave the club in the summer.\n\nNone of United\u2019s forward players were on form at the London Stadium, but they were given very little to work with. Dan James did his best to offer a directness. He was expertly marked out of the game, though. And Marcus Rashford was equally ineffective.\n\nSolskjaer must find a way to bring his attacking players into the game. United\u2019s build-up play was slow and one-dimensional, allowing West Ham to defend in numbers and snuff out any potential openings.\n\nAlexander-Arnold getting better and better\n\nIf Trent Alexander-Arnold starts regularly adding goals to his game, he will be a truly formidable opponent. His crossing ability is well-known by now, but he is equally adept at picking out a corner of the net with ease too.\n\nHe proved that on Sunday afternoon, planting the ball into the top corner from a free kick just outside the box. And he was typically reliable throughout the game, covering ground up and down the right flank, doing his defensive duties well and causing problems, as ever, in attack.\n\nAnd at 20, there should still be far more to come from Alexander-Arnold. That is a daunting prospect for the rest of the division.\n\nChelsea showing few signs of fixing defensive problems Only Norwich and bottom of the league Watford have conceded more goals in the Premier League than Chelsea this season. That is hugely concerning for a team with aspirations of a top four finish. Frank Lampard\u2019s side have now let in 13 goals, and the manager does not appear to have an obvious solution to their defensive woes. It will not help that Andreas Christensen was forced off injured in the first half, replaced by the out of form Kurt Zouma. It was far too easy for Liverpool to put balls into the box, and Chelsea looked particularly susceptible from set pieces. The second goal, headed in by an open Firmino, demonstrated the hosts\u2019 severe defensive deficiencies. Goal scoring has not been a problem for the Blues, but they will need to stem the flow at the other end, and soon, if they are to challenge at the top of the Premier League. Tomori coped with Salah to show promise for the Chelsea defence (EPA) West Ham quietly establishing themselves as a top six contender Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side have gone under the radar a little so far this season. Six games in, the Hammers sit nicely in fourth place, level on points with Leicester. They have been beaten just once, that hammering on the opening day of the season at the hands of Manchester City. And Sunday\u2019s victory over Manchester United means West Ham have now accrued three wins from their last four games, an impressive run of form that should not go unnoticed. It is early in the season, of course, and much can change, but West Ham look on course for a productive season. And given the inconsistency of some of those expected to challenge for a place in the top six this campaign, there is no reason not to be ambitious.\n\nPepe has answered manager\u2019s plea to adapt to Arsenal\n\nWith his first six Arsenal appearances demonstrating only flashes of his potential, Nicolas Pepe finally answered Emery\u2019s pleas to adapt to the club and to the Premier League.\n\nThe Frenchman scored a penalty, and was bright throughout the game. If Pepe can fully adapt to English football, and play at a similar standard to how he did for Lille last season, where he scored 22 goals in 38 games, he could be a big plus for the Gunners.\n\nCherries believe in best-ever season under Howe\n\nEddie Howe has inspired Bournemouth to feel comfortable in the top flight, yet inconsistency has prevented them from really daring to dream.\n\nTheir expansive football has often been cancelled out by a leaky defence, yet now Howe\u2019s side are showing a more ruthless approach and grabbed a 3-1 win at Southampton to rise to sixth in the table, a point outside the top four.\n\nWith West Ham and Norwich at home either side of Arsenal away, before a trip to bottom of the table Watford, Howe should be eyeing up nine points from the next four games to instil fresh belief they can achieve their best-ever finish in the Premier League of eighth or higher (topping their ninth place finish in 2017).\n\nVAR leaves knock-on effect in games\n\nJust past the hour-mark of this game, Spurs had scored a goal, until they hadn\u2019t. Serge Aurier\u2019s strike was disallowed for offside in possibly the most pedantic VAR check we\u2019ve seen so far this season. Moments later Spurs\u2019 frustration would only grow.\n\nLeicester\u2019s right-back Ricardo Pereira was wheeling away just minutes later having scored an equaliser. Defensive frailties may have played a part, Jamie Vardy\u2019s brilliant movement and assist helped, but was the VAR call moments before still lingering in Tottenham minds?\n\nThe same could have been said for Chelsea after being denied an equaliser through Cesar Azpilicueta for an offside against Mason Mount in the build-up and Liverpool quickly punished them with Roberto Firmino doubling their lead. Yes, VAR has its problems and comprehending its use will be key moving forward, but teams must learn to reset quicker when decisions go against them.", "description": "Manchester City\u00a0may have blown away Watford 8-0 but the gap to Liverpool\u00a0remains five points.\u00a0 The Reds held on against Chelsea\u00a0to win a sixth successive game this season \u2013 a 15th overall going back to last season.", "authors": ["Sports Staff"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/19/Chelsea-vs-Liverpool.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
