That company would be renamed Madewell Group Inc. before the completion of the offering.\n\nJ.Crew plans to raise $100 million, an amount that companies often use as a placeholder to calculate filing fees and is often changed. It didn\u2019t say in registration documents how many shares it intended to offer to the public.\n\nIt plans to use the proceeds from the offering to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes.\n\nMadewell\u2019s revenue for the quarter ended Aug. 3 climbed 15% to $139.7 million, while same-store sales, a key retail metric, jumped 10%.\n\nJ.Crew sought consent in July for a Madewell offering from a group of lenders including Anchorage Capital Group LLC and Blackstone Group Inc. \u2019s GSO Capital Partners, The Wall Street Journal reported. As of Feb. 2, J.Crew had debt of $1.7 billion.\n\nWrite to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com", "description": "J.Crew formally made plans to spin off its fast-growing Madewell brand in an initial public offering, expecting to use the proceeds to pay down debt.", "authors": ["Kimberly Chin", "Kimberly.Chin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107199/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
