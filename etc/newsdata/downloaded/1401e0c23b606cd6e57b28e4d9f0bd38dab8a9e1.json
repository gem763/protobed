Bongo once represented Ngrayi in a provincial disciplinary matter,\u201d she said.\n\nNtshalintshali said that Bongo initially asked to be excused from the NDC \u2013 because he was still recuperating from an illness \u2013 but was suddenly available.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d said Ntshalintshali, \u201cbecause this process was highly managed. The ANC cannot claim to fight gender-based violence while they cannot protect us who are inside the organisation.\u201d\n\nREAD: Mabuza is the \u2018Al Capone\u2019of Mpumalanga \u2013 former ally Dube\n\nBongo did not answer his phone or respond to written questions. ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe, also did not respond.\n\nThe disciplinary committee\u2019s report will now be deliberated on by the national executive committee.\n\nThe national disciplinary committee acquitted Ngwenya on the grounds that the ANC failed \u201cto prove on a balance of probabilities that he assaulted Ntshalintshali\u201d.\n\nA police officer assigned to protect Ntshalintshali, the committee said, did not say what happened after Ngwenya had passed him during the scuffle.\n\n\u201cAll he had to do, in the view of the NDC, was to turn around and he would have been best placed to tell the NDC whether comrade Ngwenya attacked or punched the acting provincial secretary or had any physical contact with her,\u201d reads the NDC report.\n\n\u201cIn view of the diametrically opposed versions presented by the ANC and comrade Ngwenya and in the absence of evidence by Captain Khoza [the police officer] to corroborate the version of the acting provincial secretary, the NDC finds that the ANC has not proved on a balance of probabilities that comrade Ngwenya assaulted the acting provincial secretary. He is found not guilty and acquitted.\u201d\n\nNkuna was found guilty of assault and the disciplinary committee rejected her claims that Ntshalintshali provoked her.\n\nIt directed Nkuna to personally apologise to Ntshalintshali and the ANC.\n\nNtshalintshali said that she was now relying on the courts for justice after she laid criminal assault charges against Ngwenya and Nkuna.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the fight to their doorstep and it\u2019s going to be rough,\u201d she said.\n\nUnderlying tensions, need for leadership training\n\nThe NDC has recommended that provincial and regional ANC leaders be sent to the OR Tambo Political School of Leadership to expand their political understanding and be referred for anger management.\n\n\u201cThe NDC wishes to bring to the attention of the secretary-general\u2019s office the lack of cohesion among the leaders and serious underlying tensions in the province which detract from the unity project of the organisation. The NDC has noted that inter-personal relations are so low that comrades did not even speak to each other at the disciplinary hearing. Furthermore, the anger of the comrades was palpable,\u201d it said.\n\nBoost for premier\u2019s campaign\n\nNgwenya\u2019s acquittal has thrown the cat among the pigeons as those in rival factions were hoping that he would be sanctioned and kept out of ANC work.\n\nHis clasp on Ehlanzeni region, which is the biggest in the province, and his close ties with Deputy President David Mabuza, have made him one of the most valuable politicians \u2013 a kingmaker.\n\nNgwenya\u2019s freedom to do ANC work again will boost Mpumalanga premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane\u2019s campaign to be ANC provincial chairperson on December 6.\n\nNgwenya is in the premier\u2019s corner.\n\nTheir first task now is to wrestle for control of the new and bigger Ehlanzeni region following the amalgamation.\n\nThe regional conference will take place on November 23, and it is unclear if Ngwenya will contest it or if his faction will field current Bohlabelo chairperson, Gillion Mashego.\n\n\u201cIf Ngwenya does not contest, he is likely to campaign to be Mpumalanga ANC treasurer.\u201d\n\nThe faction that takes control of this region will effectively be in pole position to win the provincial conference.\n\nFactions are coming together and it now looks like Mtshweni-Tsipane will be challenging acting chairperson, Mandla Ndlovu.\n\nNdlovu, according to sources, is now going to work with Peter Nyoni, who has been campaigning to be provincial chairperson.\n\nNyoni will settle for the position of secretary.", "description": "The ANC\u2019s national disciplinary committee\u2019s decision to acquit Mpumalanga ANC heavyweight Ngrayi Ngwenya of assaulting the party\u2019s provincial acting secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali has brought into question the committee\u2019s impartiality.", "authors": ["Sizwe Sama Yende"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/291bea908a3543f897c1832350ab981d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
