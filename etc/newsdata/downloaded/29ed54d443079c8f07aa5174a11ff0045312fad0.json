On CBC television, host Rosemary Barton was joined by members of the public broadcaster\u2019s prestige At Issue panel in a unanimous conclusion: Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives did not triumph because they failed to support a national carbon tax and thereby fall in line behind the Liberal, NDP, Bloc and Green climate-change policies.\n\nThey\u2019re serious. To beat that lineup of green new dealers \u2014 pipeline killers, fossil-fuel eliminators, tax-and-regulate central planners \u2014 all the Tories needed to do was edge closer to the centre and into the great mushy middle of Canadian politics.\n\nToronto Star columnist Chantal H\u00e9bert endorsed the idea that the Tories needed a tougher carbon policy in future. HuffPost Canada\u2019s Althia Raj and the National Post\u2019s Andrew Coyne agreed. I wasn\u2019t taking notes, but the drift was clear. Had the Conservatives adopted the prevailing media promotion of a looming climate emergency and endorsed a carbon tax and other policies aimed at overthrowing oil and gas as the energy foundation of the Canadian economy, Scheer might have overwhelmed Trudeau.\n\nThe Conservatives certainly presented a flawed, inconsistent and muddled platform, but on three key issues the party stood out: debt, deficits and climate change. Would it make sense to now blame the Conservatives\u2019 failure to gain a majority, or even a minority, on the fact that the party had not adopted the deficit spending extravaganzas proposed by the Liberals, the NDP and the Green party?\n\nThere is no doubt that many Canadians are agitated about climate change. After years of manufactured suggestions that every storm, flood and fire is the result of fossil-fuel consumption, it\u2019s a miracle we are not all huddled in basements awaiting conflagration or boarding an ark in preparation for the next Genesis flood. After years of indoctrinating Canadian youth into believing that polar bears are disappearing and that all humans could perish like dinosaurs in the coming sixth extinction, today\u2019s voters are understandably concerned.\n\nThus the 2019 Canadian election results: 5.69 million Canadians voted for three parties (NDP, Bloc, Green) that have no use for fossil fuels \u2014 which suggests that more than 30 per cent of voters experience various forms of induced climate panic. A good proportion of the Liberal\u2019s 5.9 million votes also likely support carbon taxes and dramatic climate action, which means that at least 50 per cent of Canadians would have voted Monday under the influence of climate-change fear.\n\nNone of this implies, as many media commentators are suggesting, that the Conservatives should produce get-tough climate policies. The party has enough pandering and compromises built into its so-called conservative platform without shovelling in climate-change control policies just for the sake of winning votes.\n\nIn many respects, this was Canada\u2019s first climate-change election, and the Conservatives played a major role. By playing down the alarmism and rejecting the fear-driven carbon tax, the Conservatives offered a considered (if not entirely coherent) alternative that was favoured by many voters. By winning almost 35 per cent of the popular vote, beating the Liberals and leaving NDP and Greens far behind, the Conservatives demonstrated that the party\u2019s stance on climate and other policies has a wide and strong following.\n\nThe Conservative Party of Canada certainly needs reform and renewal based on clear principles that reflect a small \u201cc\u201d world-view based on individual freedom, rule of law and market economics divorced from the prevailing liberal/left ideological movements that are dominating Canadian and U.S. politics.\n\nThe constant claims that economic policy should automatically follow the \u201cscience\u201d of climate change are based on political and ideological ideas, not science. It is no coincidence that global warming science theory introduced decades ago was instantly adopted by economic and political interventionists as the foundation for a new revolution. Few waited to find out how realistic and accurate the climate models might be, even fewer cared.\n\nThe ideological merger of climate alarmist and the left is on full display in the United States, where the Green New Deal has been meshed with radical social and economic ideas that aim to turn the U.S. economy upside down. Canada\u2019s Conservatives are right to have rejected climate extremism, and they have proven that large numbers of Canadians are not willing to enlist in a plan to stage a socialist revolution on the back of unfinished climate-change theory and models.\n\nClimate science questions and contradictions that justify a conservative approach emerge almost daily. Here\u2019s one from Monday, a new paper in Geophysical Research Letters by MIT researchers. Remember the stories about how rapidly melting 30-metre-high Antarctic ice cliffs would raise global sea levels that would put Boston, New York and other cities under water? Won\u2019t happen, said the lead author of the paper: \u201cTo get into catastrophic failures of really tall ice cliffs, you would have to remove these ice shelves within hours, which seems unlikely no matter what the climate-change scenario.\u201d\n\nRoger Pielke Jr., at the University of Colorado, also this week described how the UN\u2019s 100-year climate scenarios are not working out as modelled for 2020. Even though the world has not adopted radical climate policies yet, current carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are lower than expected, suggesting something is wrong with the models. \u201cIf climate scenarios are wrong for 2020,\u201d asks Pielke, \u201ccan they get 2100 right?\u201d\n\nThese are just two small climate science pull-backs among many. The Conservatives should stick to (and refine) the policies of climate caution that received wide support in Monday\u2019s climate election.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: tcorcoran@nationalpost.com | Twitter: terencecorcoran", "description": "Party has enough pandering built into its so-called conservative platform without shovelling in climate change policies just for the sake of winning votes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/scheer-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
