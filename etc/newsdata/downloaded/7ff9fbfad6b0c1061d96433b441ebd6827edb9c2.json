The champion became the first to stop his challenger with strikes, landing a perfectly placed knee for the knockout in less than four minutes.\n\nCarrizosa came out trying to fight aggressively and put the heat on the champion, who had UFC contender Leon Edwards in his corner. Herbert wasn\u2019t having any of it, though, because he held his own in each exchange and fired back with effective offense of his own at a consistent rate.\n\nThe beginning of the end came during a clinch exchange near the fence. Carrizosa tried to fire off a series of elbows strikes, but Herbert answered by winding up a huge knee that caught Carrizosa clean on the button and instantly sent him down in a heap.\n\nFollow-up shots were not required from Herbert, and the referee waved off the main event at the 3:36 mark of Round 1.\n\nWith six consecutive wins and title defense under his belt, Herbert said he feels ready to graduate from the Cage Warriors roster and called for a spot on the card when the UFC makes its annual visit to London in 2020.\n\n\u201cAm I UFC ready or what?\u201d Herbert said in his post-fight interview. \u201cLondon in March. Get me on that card.\u201d\n\nCharriere unloads on Trueman for TKO\n\nAfter struggling a bit in the first round, Morgan Charriere (15-7-1) found his groove in the second and eventually the finish by TKO in the third in his featherweight fight with former champion Dean Trueman (10-6).\n\nTrueman started the fight strong by getting the upper hand in the grappling exchanges. He couldn\u2019t get a finish, though, which allowed Charriere to get comfortable in the fight and find an avenue to turn the tide.\n\nCharriere did that successfully in the second frame, getting the advantage when the fight went back to the grappling department. In the third round, however, it was the striking of Charriere that made the difference. He caught Trueman with a massive overhand that stunned him and Charriere pursued the finish from there, landing some punches then a huge knee that forced the referee to intervene at the 1:08 mark of Round 3.\n\nWith back-to-back wins under the Cage Warriors banner, Charriere left a simple message during his post-fight interview. He\u2019s coming for the 145-pound belt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming for the title,\u201d Charriere said in his post-fight interview. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nComplete Cage Warriors 109 results included:", "description": "Jai Herbert's first lightweight title defense came in the Cage Warriors 109 headliner when he crushed Cain Carrizosa with a brutal knee.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/jai-herbert-cage-warriors-106.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
