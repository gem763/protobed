In the state of South Carolina, anonymously sending an \u201cobscene, profane, indecent, vulgar, suggestive, or immoral\u201d file without the recipient\u2019s consent can be punished by up to three years of imprisonment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Theguardian.Com Lifeandstyle Sep Its-A-Violation-The-War-On-Unwanted-Dick-Pics-Has-Begun"], "top_image": ""}
