Washington is first team in more than a century to fall 12 games below .500 and finish with 93 wins or more. ... There were plenty of early calls for manager Dave Martinez to be dismissed, but GM Mike Rizzo never wavered in his public support of the skipper.

In first season since star slugger Bryce Harper left as a free agent, Washington finally got over playoff hump in October after four NLDS heartbreaks in six seasons \u2014 three in Game 5 at home.

Astros had two no-hitters this season with Verlander throwing third of his career against Toronto after Aaron Sanchez, Joe Biagini, Harris and Chris Devenski combined for one against Seattle.

Cole set team record by winning last 16 regular-season decisions and had career-low ERA. His career-high 326 strikeouts were most in majors and set franchise record that had stood since 1979 when J.R. Richard fanned 313. They were most in majors since Randy Johnson had 334 in 2002 for Arizona and most in AL since Nolan Ryan fanned 341 for Angels in 1977.

Correa also batted .171 in playoffs but had 2 big homers and 5 RBIs in ALCS vs. Yankees.\n\n___\n\nWatch For:\n\n\u2014 Aces Full. In this new age of teams relying so heavily on relievers, these pennant winners are anchored by powerful rotations. Especially at the top. Cole is 19-0 in his last 25 starts and hasn't lost since May 22. That includes 3-0 in the AL playoffs, when he allowed one earned run in 22 2/3 innings with 32 strikeouts. A victory in the opener would give him the longest winning streak for a pitcher in one year. Strasburg has a 1.10 ERA in 41 career postseason innings. Both can become free agents this fall. Throw in Scherzer, Corbin, Verlander and Greinke, and hitters could have a tough time all Series.\n\n\u2014 Hot Corner. Each club has an MVP contender at third base. Rendon led the majors in RBIs this year and ranked third in the NL with a 1.010 OPS. He's kept it going during the postseason, batting .375 with 5 extra-base hits and 7 RBIs. Bregman was third in the AL with a 1.015 OPS before hitting .257 with a homer, 3 doubles, 4 RBIs and 10 runs during the playoffs. He was mostly held in check by the Yankees, who walked him seven times. Both guys can pick it on defense, too.\n\n\u2014 Los Viejos. The rolling Nationals, who have won 16 of 18, revel in all the elder statesmen who are a huge part of their success in an era when many teams are trying to go young. \"Los Viejos\" \u2014 Spanish for \"The Old Guys\" \u2014 include 36-year-olds Kendrick and Suzuki, along with Scherzer, S\u00e1nchez and Zimmerman, each 35. Rodney, 42, is the oldest active player in the majors. They helped make Washington the oldest club in baseball this season, with an average age just under 31. Houston wasn't far behind, ranked third with an average age just above 30. The Astros' roster also features six players who are at least 35, including Verlander and Greinke.\n\n\u2014 Little Big Man. The 5-foot-6 Altuve continues to amaze. Heart and soul of the Astros, the 2017 AL MVP put Houston back in World Series with walk-off homer against closer Aroldis Chapman in bottom of ninth inning to beat Yankees in Game 6. He batted .348 with 2 homers to win ALCS MVP award. He's hitting .349 with 5 homers, 3 doubles, 8 RBIs, 10 runs and 1.184 OPS in October. Altuve has 13 career postseason homers, most by a second baseman and tied with Springer for franchise record.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
