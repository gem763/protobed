Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nAnd we\u2019re back \u2014 now with 50 percent less generic candidates! Thankfully, although not permanently, the next Democratic debate will take place with all 10 candidates appearing for the first time on just one night: Thursday, September 12.\n\nWhat Time are the Democratic Debates?\n\nHosted by Texas Southern University in Houston, the festivities will start at 8 p.m. and drag on until 11 p.m.\n\nWhat Channel has the Democratic Debates?\n\nThe debates will be aired on ABC and Univision, though if you\u2019re watching it online, free streams are available at ABCNews.com and FiveThirtyEight.\n\nWhat is the Democratic Debate Lineup?\n\nThe candidates will appear onstage, from left to right, as follows:\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nCory Booker\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nJoe Biden\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nKamala Harris\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nAs is immediately apparent, the centrist frontrunner is flanked by the two progressives closest in the polls, which should make for a compelling dynamic. As many have noted, this will be the first debate in which Warren and Biden appear on-stage together.\n\nHow\u2019d They Decide Who Made the Cut?\n\nTo qualify for the debates, the Democratic National Committee determined that Democrats had to receive contributions from a minimum of 130,000 donors, and had to register at least 2 percent of support in four DNC-approved pools.\n\nWho Are the Moderators for the Democratic Debates?\n\nABC chief anchor George Stephanopoulos; ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis; ABC World News Tonight anchor David Muir; and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos.\n\nHow Are the Candidates Preparing for the Democratic Debates?\n\nSee this extensive analysis of the debates from New York\u2019s Ed Kilgore, who addresses a key difference between the past two rounds and the stage in Houston:\n\nWith ten of the lower-polling (and in some cases, fringe) candidates no longer among them, they will probably expect more equal treatment in questions from the moderators, and they will have a bit more time than in the first two rounds of debates to answer them (according to principal sponsor ABC: one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses to questions and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals).\n\nWhen Are the Next Democratic Debates?\n\nThe fourth debate is scheduled for October 15 and possibly, unfortunately, October 16. Because the debate thresholds remain the same for the third and fourth rounds, the October event is actually easier to qualify for than Thursday night\u2019s debate. (One caveat: The DNC has yet to actually confirm if they will approve a return to the two-night format.) So it\u2019s quite plausible we could see the return of Michael Bennet, Bill de Blasio, Steve Bullock, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Tim Ryan, and Marianne Williamson \u2014 not to mention the first appearance of billionaire YouTube ad guy Tom Steyer, who claims he\u2019s already qualified.", "description": "The fourth 2020 Democratic primary debate will air at 8 p.m. on Thursday and stream for free online at ABCNews and FiveThirtyEight.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/07/29/detroit_debate.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
