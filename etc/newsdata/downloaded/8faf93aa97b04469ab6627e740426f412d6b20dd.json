It averages 45.6mpg with CO2 emissions of 161g/km.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Quick: The soft-top can be opened and closed within 15 seconds\n\nOn some wonderfully twisting mountain roads, I tested its nimble handling and solid cornering - while I was also able to open up the throttle on some enticing straight stretches.\n\nIn normal 'comfort' setting it roils and rumbles along quite merrily with a satisfyingly background burble.\n\nBut switch into 'sport' mode and put your foot down and whoosh. There is a wonderfully throaty roar and a satisfying note that brings a smile.\n\nHit the brakes and the car drops down through the gears, blipping and spluttering like a proper sports car. Do it via the manual paddles and it's an even more effective sound-track to your driving.\n\nDetails: Here are some of the impressive features of the 8-series convertible\n\nWith the top down, the sun on your face, the wind in your hair and the view of the open road ahead through your sun-glasses, thoughts of the daily grind subside.\n\nDid someone mention Brexit? Pah. BMW calls it 'unadulterated sports car pleasure.'\n\nThat is all helped by the wonderfully supportive seats.\n\nIt's not just about performance - it's about living the dream. This is a sensational luxury grand tourer for those old and experienced enough to appreciate the good things in life.\n\nIf you are of a certain age, have made a bob or two, risk getting a perma-tan from all that time on the golf course, and fancy a motor that's more mature than a regular sports car, this could be just the job for you.\n\nFlashy: The interior comes complete with a crystal gear selector\n\nThere are some lovely touches. The crystal gear selector impresses, as did the glistening metallic flecks in the exterior paint work, the beautiful light-tan tan leather interior, and the sharp Bowers and Wilkins hi-fi system.\n\nThough a four-seater with two supportive bucket-style seats in the back, there's not really a lot of leg-room, particularly if the front occupants have pushed back their seats.\n\nBut handy to chuck in a soft-bag or two if you need more luggage space.\n\nShould a sudden shower threaten, the soft-top roof both opens and closes in just 15 seconds at speeds of up to 31mph.\n\nPremium: The soft top version costs an extra \u00a37,000\n\nIt also has four layers in its lightweight and sound-deadening insulated electric fabric top available in standard black or an optional anthracite silver.\n\nWith the roof up, the soft-top roof sits taut over the interior to retain its coup\u00e9-like silhouette and avoids the exposed 'ribs' of what German engineers call 'the hungry cow' look.\n\nThe soft-top stows away neatly under a cover finished in colours that complement and match the instrument panel and interior door and side panel trim.\n\nThe cover also features eye-catching blister domes at the level of the rear seats, to emphasise the racing heritage.\n\nThe stowage compartment for the soft-top roof means the trailing edge of the car's body is slightly higher than that of coup\u00e9.\n\nBut with the roof down the rear end appears extremely flat and low to the road.\n\nRay of light: With sunny conditions, Ray drove with the top down, wind in his hair - and his trusty shades were essential\n\nThe new 8-series cabriolet also promises that its wind in the hair motoring will not be a pain in the neck.\n\nFor it features neck warmers for the driver and front passenger that blows warm air around from the seat, just below the headrest, to the back of the head to help eliminate chills while on the move.\n\nBMW says the new convertible 'combines open-top, four-seater luxury with sports-car performance and handling' with only a small number of additional 'convertible-specific and weight-increasing measures' required.\n\nPerformance figures and trim for the cabriolet are very similar to the coupe version which I drove late last year. Acceleration is only fractionally slower and fuel economy slightly less.\n\nFront and back: The BMW goes on sale soon - and could be a popular choice\n\nHorizontal lines and lights extending into the flanks accentuate the width of the car. A third brake light embedded in the boot lid adds to the low-slung look.\n\nA new rollover protection system has been engineered for the convertible to protect up to four occupants.\n\nIt consists of two protective aluminium bars fitted within the head restraints which will be deployed if the car is likely to roll over.\n\nFlip down: The rear seats give little room - but can be flipped down to create extra boot space\n\nWith the soft-top closed, stowage capacity is 350 litres. The two rear seats give little room save for small children or the odd emergency run. But they do flip-down to create extra stowage space from the boot behind.\n\nElectrically adjustable multifunction seats are fitted as standard in both models and are trimmed in Merino leather in a range of colours.\n\nWill it fit in my garage? BMW M850i Cabriolet with xDrive Price: \u00a3107,045 (around \u00a37,000 more than the coupe) Length: 4,843mm Width: 1,902mm Height: 1,339mm Wheelbase: 2,822mm Engine: 4.4 litre V8 Power: 530hp 0-62mph: 3.9 seconds (0.2 seconds slower that the hard-top-top). Top speed: electronically limited to 155mph. Fuel economy: 28.5mpg CO2 emissions: 225g/km. Fabric top: Open and closes in 15 seconds at speeds of up to 31mph.\n\nThe rear horse-shoe styling with a metallic chrome trim on the car I saw in the metal resembles that of a luxury yacht.\n\nIn anthracite grey and black with a chrome trim option instead of sporty carbon fibre on the 8-series coupe I drove last year.\n\nThe new 8-series cabriolet is being launched with a choice of seven metallic and one non-metallic exterior colours, plus a customised 'individual' palette of paint finishes including frozen bluestone.\n\nThe optional 'chrome line exterior' gives a shiny chrome trim to the side window graphic and exterior mirror bases.\n\nHigh-gloss chrome is used for the surround and slats of the BMW kidney grille and exhaust tailpipes.\n\nCustomers can also specify an M Carbon exterior package as an option, which adds air intake bars, exterior mirror covers and a rear apron insert that houses the exhaust tailpipes.\n\nBMW expects to sell around 500 convertibles in the first full year \u2013 about half the number of coupes \u2013 with petrol and diesel sales roughly 50:50.\n\nA range-topping four-door Gran Coupe and powerful 'M' motorsport division versions of the 8-series are set to follow.", "description": "Prices of the 8-series start from \u00a383,270 and quickly rising into six figures - but it won't save the planet, averaging just 28.5mpg with CO2 emissions of 225g/km.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Mailonline And Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
