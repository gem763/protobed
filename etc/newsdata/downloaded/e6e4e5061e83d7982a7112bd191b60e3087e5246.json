We paid a lot of money to fight with them but that's ok.\"\n\nThe backlash against Mr Trump over the issue has pushed him to impose fresh sanctions on Turkey, and to halt trade negotiations with the country.\n\nIn addition, Mr Trump has called on Turkey to impose a cease fire in the area, and is sending vice president Mike Pence to the region to help negotiate that measure on Wednesday. Turkey, however, has indicated that it does not want to impose a cease fire.\n\nJoining Mr Pence is secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said during an interview with Fox News on Wednesday morning that Mr Trump wanted those two to begin negotiations to ensure the Turkish government understands the US is taking the issue seriously.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
