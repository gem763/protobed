I\u2019m not the only one who felt that way. I think it\u2019s really good we have it, we have this potential and it\u2019s exercised in the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In the old days they put an actor we all knew and loved and put grey hair on him and we would be like \u201coh he got older\u201d, and you accept it because it\u2019s in the story.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
