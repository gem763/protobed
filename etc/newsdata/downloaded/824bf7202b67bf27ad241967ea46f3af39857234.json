The publication New Scientist described him as \u201cthe man behind the first research into what really makes people laugh,\u201d an endeavor that encompassed developmental and behavioral psychology, neuroscience and theories of evolution.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLaughter is part of this universal human vocabulary,\u201d Dr. Provine once told NPR. \u201cEveryone speaks this language. Just as birds of a given species all sing their species\u2019 typical song, laughter is part of our own human song.\u201d\n\nHe was drawn to the study of laughter, among other behavioral phenomena, in part because he had grown lonely in the laboratory, where he devoted the early years of his career to the study of nerve cells.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was getting tired of putting electrodes in nerve cells in a windowless room for six or eight hour days,\u201d he told the Boston Globe in 2012. \u201cBut I was also interested in examining human behaviors using the same kind of rigorous procedures.\u201d\n\nThose procedures, at first, included inviting study participants to sit in a lab and watch episodes of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d or bits by comedians Rodney Dangerfield, George Carlin and Joan Rivers. The setting proved unconducive to laughter, however, and forced Dr. Provine and his colleagues to change course.\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ginger Baker, Cokie Roberts, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nAD\n\nIn what he described as \u201cthe spirit of Jane Goodall heading out to Gombe Stream Preserve to study chimpanzees,\u201d he set out on an \u201curban safari\u201d to observe people laughing in shopping malls and on the street. On one occasion, he wrote, a \u201clarge and aggressive woman\u201d mistook him for a store detective.\n\nAD\n\nWith help from assistant researchers, he observed 1,200 examples of laughter. The team decamped for the acoustic laboratory at the National Zoo in Washington, where they studied recordings of laughter on equipment designed to analyze bird calls. From this research, Dr. Provine drew a number of conclusions.\n\nMost fundamental was the observation that laughter usually comes in response not to uproarious humor but rather to dialogue that he compared to an \u201cinterminable television situation comedy scripted by an extremely ungifted writer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome laughter might reward a knee-slapping joke, but he found that it serves more often to establish or strengthen bonds between a speaker and the person or people listening. Laughter can be used unkindly, too, to wound or to exclude someone from a group. In other situations, a person may laugh at jokes made by a superior to acknowledge that person\u2019s authority.\n\nAD\n\nOutside the confines of a comedy club, people who are speaking tend to laugh more than their interlocutors. Women, Dr. Provine found, laugh more at men than men laugh at women. Only when a man was speaking to a woman did the person listening laugh more than the person speaking.\n\nHe described laughter as an \u201chonest social signal because it\u2019s hard to fake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with something powerful, ancient and crude,\u201d he once told the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of behavioral fossil showing the roots that all human beings, maybe all mammals, have in common.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDr. Provine\u2019s book \u201cCurious Behavior\u201d examined other behaviors humans (and many animals) have in common, including crying, tearing up in emotion, sneezing and belching. His study of yawning revealed that all vertebrates, including fish, yawn; that yawns often come during moments of transition, not only when one falls asleep or wakes up but also when one is cold and becomes warm; and, perhaps counterintuitively, that yawns can often accompany excitement. Paratroopers, he discovered, yawn before making a leap.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWith its many facts and anecdotes and unexpected stories, [the volume] begs you to continue where curiosity leads you, down both the boulevards and the back alleys of science,\u201d reviewer James Gorman wrote in the National Post of Canada. \u201cAnd that is exactly how he thinks science should be pursued. \u2018You follow the trail wherever it goes,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nRobert Raymond Provine was born in Tulsa, on May 11, 1943. His father was a chemist, and his mother was a homemaker. As a high school student, Dr. Provine built telescopes, an endeavor that attracted coverage in local newspapers \u2014 his first foray into popular science.\n\nAD\n\nHe studied psychology at Oklahoma State University, where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1965, and at Washington University in St. Louis, where he received a PhD in 1971. His graduate school advisers included the embryologist Viktor Hamburger and Rita Levi-Montalcini, a Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist\n\nAD\n\nDr. Provine\u2019s first marriage, to Helene \u201cVivi\u201d Vona, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 23 years, Helen Weems of Columbia, Md.; two children from his first marriage, Kimberly Lourenco of Olney, Md., and Robert W. Provine of West Hollywood, Calif.; and three grandchildren.\n\nA reporter for The Washington Post once asked Dr. Provine about the reaction he received from dinner party guests when he told them the subjects of his scientific inquiry.\n\n\u201cEveryone always seems interested,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they ask if I am observing them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIf he wasn\u2019t, he added, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a good scientist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the only way to be successful, whether you are doing science or running a restaurant, is that you have to be totally engaged in what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Dr. Provine said. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn it on and off.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "A neuroscientist and psychology professor, he brought scientific rigor to the study of universal human behaviors that had previously gone largely unexplored.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2JPhcYMVOo5u17MPZq9YhFDVl1A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NPXGGWXR3AI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
