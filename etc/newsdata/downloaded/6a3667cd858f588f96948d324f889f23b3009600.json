Elizabeth Warren demanding that Facebook remove Trump campaign ads that make false claims.\n\nAfter Facebook refused to remove the ad saying that it\u2019s not a political gatekeeper, Warren paid for a fake political ad that claimed Zuckerberg and Facebook have endorsed President Donald Trump.\n\nThe ad states in the next sentence that it\u2019s not true.\n\nPressure on the social media platform is escalating as the 2020 general election approaches.\n\nBiden said that he\u2019d be open to breaking up Facebook. Sen. Kamala Harris of California has said she\u2019s would consider new controls on the tech giant.\n\nFacebook faces the risk of more accusations of political bias by blocking or suspending accounts, but also of creating a toxic online environment by doing nothing to remove bogus political ads and groups.\n\nResearch has revealed that millions of people get at least some political news on social platforms. A Pew Research Center survey found that a majority of American adults believe the news they see on such platforms are largely inaccurate.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg defended meetings he's reportedly had with conservative leaders after #DeleteFacebook began trending on social media.
