REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nBoeing said in a statement that it was addressing Indonesia\u2019s safety recommendations and taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 MAX. Saying it mourned with Lion Air, the manufacturer promised to learn from the crash.\n\nThe FAA said it welcomed the report\u2019s recommendations and would carefully consider them and all others as it continued to review Boeing\u2019s proposed changes to the 737 MAX.\n\nIndonesia may require pilots receive simulator training before the plane returns to service as earlier computer-based training covering differences between the 737 MAX and prior 737 NG model was insufficient, Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said on Friday.\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\nBoeing faces a slew of investigations by regulators, U.S. Congress, and the Department of Justice over its development of the 737 MAX, its previously best-selling workhorse for short-haul travel.\n\nBoeing last month settled the first claims stemming from the Lion Air crash, a U.S. plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer said.\n\nThree other sources told Reuters that families of those killed would receive at least $1.2 million each.\n\nThe manufacturer is separately facing around 100 lawsuits over the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10 which killed all 157 people on board the flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi.\n\nIndonesia has offered to aid Ethiopian authorities in their investigation into that crash but to date there has been no response, said Soerjanto, the head of Indonesia\u2019s accident investigator.\n\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said this week the company was making \u201cdaily\u201d progress on testing the final software fix for the 737 MAX and developing related training materials. The FAA has said it would need at least several more weeks for review.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe Indonesia report said that Boeing\u2019s safety assessment assumed pilots would respond within three seconds of a system malfunction but on the accident flight and one that experienced the same problem the previous evening, it took both crews about eight seconds to respond.\n\nIt called for the systems to be designed not just for highly skilled test pilots but also for regular commercial airline pilots.\n\nThe FAA had delegated increasing authority to Boeing to certify the safety of its own aircraft, Indonesian investigators said in the report, recommending that all certification processes received adequate oversight.\n\nA panel of international air safety regulators this month also faulted Boeing for assumptions it made in designing the 737 MAX and found areas where Boeing could improve processes.", "description": "Boeing , acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on its 737 MAX airliner, sowing the seeds for a Lion Air crash that also involved errors by airline workers and crew, Indonesian investigators found.", "authors": ["Bernadette Christina Munthe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444851533&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0WE", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
