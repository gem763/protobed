Koko resigned from Eskom in February 2018 while the company was in the process of instituting a disciplinary hearing against him.\n\nHe faced four charges, including misleading Parliament about the McKinsey and Trillian payment, leaking confidential Eskom information to a Gupta associate and accepting flights to Dubai from a Gupta ally, as Fin24 previously reported.\n\nOn Saturday, Koko tweeted a statement from Zimbabwe authorities confirming the contract.\n\nIn an effort to improve energy generation, Zimbabwe has been awarding licences to private companies to supply solar energy.\n\nZimbabwe Electricity Distribution Company (ZETDC) is currently the only electricity distributor. The imports country imports 50MW of electricity a day from Eskom.\n\n", "description": "A company owned by former Eskom acting chief executive Matshela Koko has been granted a licence to produce solar energy in Zimbabwe", "authors": ["Crecey Kuyedzwa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7886/5468b4040b6646bf8d3ddf377ca19cce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-21"}
