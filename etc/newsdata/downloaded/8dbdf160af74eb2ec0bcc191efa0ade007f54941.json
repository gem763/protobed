But in my view, even assuming that the UK avoids a no-deal Brexit, persistently high Brexit uncertainties seem likely to continue to depress UK growth below potential for some time, especially if global growth remains disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe battered pound, which had lately shown signs of recovery, tumbled more than half a cent to $1.228.\n\nThe yield on 10-year government bonds fell sharply to 0.485%. Two-year debt was down similarly.\n\nSaunders, one of nine rate-setters on the MPC, raised fears that the UK is heading for a recession.\n\nThe economy shrank 0.2% in the second quarter. Another quarter of the same would put the UK in official recession. Until today economists had expected that to be avoided, given resilience over the summer.\n\nThe Bank has been looking to raise rates from historic lows of 0.75% and is assumed to be keen to avoid another cut. Saunders said: \u201cIn such a scenario \u2014 not a no-deal Brexit, but persistently high uncertainty \u2014 it probably will be appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and perhaps to loosen further.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe economy has not crashed,\u201d Saunders added.\n\n\u201cBut the effect of Brexit uncertainties is perhaps akin to the economy developing a slow puncture such that growth has slowed to a mere crawl.\u201d\n\nNeil Wilson at Markets.com, said: \u201cIn making the case for a cut now it conforms to the belief of many in the market that the Bank is barking up the wrong tree with its slight tightening bias in its forward guidance.\u201d\n\nSebastien Clements, currency analyst at OFX, said: \u201cSterling had a rude awakening this morning, tumbling downwards after BoE member Saunders\u2019 comments soured market sentiment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\nSimon English: That joke isn\u2019t funny any more, ethical investment wins\n\nSimon English: Strap yourselves in for the stock market \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019", "description": "Sterling tumbled on Friday after a senior Bank of England official described Brexit as a \u201cslow puncture\u201d and warned that interest rates may have to be cut within weeks.While the Bank itself is widely thought to be holding back on any move on rates, Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Michael Saunders", "authors": ["Simon English"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y.s1RvEJPTbKdpKkaN9uIQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/2469dd04930a4900cb02af34ef639199", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
