Lately it\u2019s all space shuttle this and space shuttle that. Inspired by a true story, Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne take it old-school in The Aeronauts trailer. She\u2019s a daredevil hot-air-balloon pilot facing a misogynistic industry (world, let\u2019s be real). He\u2019s a scientist with the wild idea that we can predict the weather.

Jones and Redmayne reunite for the first time since Academy Award\u2013nominated The Theory of Everything and are joined by Yesterday\u2019s Himesh Patel. The Aeronauts hits theaters on December 6 and Amazon Prime video December 20. In the meantime, screenwriters: Think up some more hot-air-balloon ideas.
