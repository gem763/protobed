But he also had some great campaign music.\n\nWe're not talking about taking an existing song and using it for political ends \u2014 \u00e0 la Tony Blair with D:Ream's \"Things can only get better\" or Ronald Reagan and his hopeless mis-hearing of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA.\" Instead, Chirac had campaign songs written for him.\n\nHere are some of the best/most memorable songs written for a politician (or at least given new lyrics to fit the candidate).\n\n\"Jacques Chirac Maintenant Pr\u00e9sident\" by Pascal Stive (1981)\n\nThis is an absolute belter, a strings-heavy slice of Philly Soul with a fabulous spacey instrumental break and a catchy chorus. Altogether now...\n\nLa France a besoin d'un homme\n\nDe courage, de r\u00e9solution,\n\nVotons, Jacques Chirac\n\nEn avant, toute la Nation.\n\nPour tous, Jacques Chirac,\n\nMaintenant, Pr\u00e9sident,\n\nEnsemble, maintenant,\n\nJacques Chirac, Pr\u00e9sident.\n\n\"Chirac pour Paris\" by Michel Paje (1977)\n\nMuch more in the chanson fran\u00e7aise tradition is this jaunty little number from Chirac's mayoral election campaign in 1977. If it was any more French, it'd be smoking.\n\n\"Dombra\" by U\u011fur I\u015f\u0131lak (2014)\n\n\"Dombra,\u201d based on a Central Asian folk tune, became more identified with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan after singer U\u011fur I\u015f\u0131lak got his hands on it. It's stirring stuff, with lots of mentions of the Turkish leader's name and lyrics such as\n\nHe is the voice of the oppressed\n\nHe is the free voice of the silent world\n\nand\n\nHe is the light of hope for millions\n\nHe is the confidant of the repressed people.\n\nThe singer, German-born I\u015f\u0131lak, became an MP in 2015 (albeit for just a few months). What tremendous good fortune.\n\n\"High hopes\" by Frank Sinatra (1960)\n\nOl' Blue Eyes went in to bat for JFK with this swinging, reworked version of his song from 1959 which first appeared in the film \"A Hole in the Head.\" Contains the playful chorus\n\nCome on and vote for Kennedy\n\nVote for Kennedy\n\nAnd we'll come out on top!\n\nOops, there goes the opposition - ker -\n\nOops, there goes the opposition - ker -\n\nOops, there goes the opposition - KERPLOP!\n\n\"I like Ike\" by Irving Berlin (1952)\n\nDwight Eisenhower had powerful friends to call upon as Irving Berlin wrote this song for an 1952 election campaign ad and Walt Disney made the accompanying TV ad. Berlin had been calling for an Eisenhower presidency for some time, and his musical \"Call me madam\" featured the line: \u201cThey like Ike / And Ike is good on a mike / They like Ike.\u201d Take that, \"Hamilton.\"\n\n\"Meno male che Silvio c'\u00e8\" by Andrea Vantini (2010)\n\n\"Thank goodness for Silvio Berlusconi\" is something we've all thought. And here's that sentiment in mawkish musical form. For some reason the video seems to focus in on attractive young women! (Other videos for this song exist that are NSFW.)\n\n\"Modi Hai To Mumkin Hai\" (2019)\n\nClearly \"Modi makes it possible\" to spend a fortune on fancy cinematography! This campaign song for India's Narendra Modi ticks a lot of campaign song boxes: upbeat, using traditional instruments with a modern twist and, most importantly, plenty of mentions of the politician's name.\n\n\"One like Putin\" by Poyuschie Vmeste (2003)\n\nA teeth-gratingly annoying piece of Russian pop that wasn't used in an election campaign but does sing the praises of one Vladimir Putin, who is clearly a much better bet than the singer's beau.\n\nMy boyfriend is in trouble once again\n\nGot in a fight, got drunk on something nasty\n\nI've had enough and I chased him away\n\nAnd now I want a man like Putin\n\nOne like Putin, full of strength\n\nOne like Putin, who won't be a drunk\n\nOne like Putin, who wouldn't hurt me\n\nOne like Putin, who won't run away!\n\n\"La Fuerza de los Pobres\" by Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram (2017)\n\nThe only politician on this list to sing his own song, former Ecuadorian President Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram, has what one might charitably call a booming voice. He's been performing this song for years but this is an, erm, stripped down acoustic version (remember that his nickname was El Loco \u2014 the madman \u2014 so it's probably safer to sing along).\n\n\"The Official Donald Trump Jam\" by Freedom Girls (2016)\n\nAppalling, exploitative drivel, this might just be the worst \"song\" of all time. The lyrics don't scan, the music makes you want to smash your face in with a hammer and while we can't blame the children, every adult involved should be ashamed (and quite possibly jailed).\n\nZia Weise and Stephen Brown contributed to this article.", "description": "Some are great, some are very much not.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Paul Taylor", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171297974-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
