Spreading optimism, President Trump tweeted that the trade negotiations with Beijing are progressing well. He also mentioned his plans to meet the Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Oct 11. These tweets received a positive response from the stock markets. Major U.S. stock indices closed around 0.6% higher following the tweets.\n\nThe timing of this meeting is also crucial. Notably, Trump had postponed the planned tariff increase of 5% on $250 billion of Chinese goods from Oct 1 to Oct 15 as \u201ca gesture of goodwill.\u201d Thus, it is believed if the trade talks fail, Trump might levy additional tariffs (read: 4 ETFs to Play the Key Events in Q4).\n\nHowever, the week had started on a relatively disappointing note with Trump administration\u2019s move to ban some of China\u2019s top AI startups.
