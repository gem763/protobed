The videos appear to show Poquoson High students and some school players at an off-campus party and feature threats and obscene language.\n\nThe school forfeited a football game last week over the videos and is set to play against a different high school on Thursday. Parish says the school is \"moving forward.\" Police Chief Cliff Bowen said there's \"no probable cause\" for arrests based on the video, but an investigation remains ongoing.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Daily Press, http://www.dailypress.com/", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
