There are things to work on in my game but scoring is my strong point.\n\n\u2018It has been nice to play a couple of groups but you don\u2019t want to keeping going too long because you want to get into Winners\u2019 Group. It\u2019s nice to get through and I can look forward to March.\u2019\n\nIt was a record-breaking couple of days for the tournament, which dates back to 2008, as more centuries were made in Group Three than any other group in the history of the event.\n\nThere were 24 centuries made over Group Three, which was one more than last year\u2019s Winners\u2019 Group, which set the record.\n\nThe Championship League is a non-ranking event, but is a nice little earner for those involved, with Wilson making \u00a38,950 for his performances over two groups, and with more prize money available in the Winners\u2019 Group.\n\nWilson has reached the semi-finals of the Six-red World Championship and the quarters at the International Championship so far this season, with runs to fourth and third rounds elsewhere.\n\nHe missed out on qualification for the upcoming World Open, but the world number 19 will be back in action at the Northern Ireland Open next month.\n\nChampionship League Group Four is played over Wednesday and Thursday, featuring Scott Donaldson, Graeme Dott, Joe Perry, Kyren Wilson, Tom Ford, Ali Carter and Matthew Selt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Snooker\u2019s European Masters heads to Austria for first ranking event in the country\n\nMORE: Barry Hawkins enjoying snooker again after tragedy took his mind off the game for two years", "description": "Gary Wilson stormed through Championship League Group Three to book his spot in the Winners' Group next March.
