However, we would like the management of the camps, in particular, something that has to be undertaken as a joint effort with the international community.\"\n\nWe never said we would shoulder this burden all by ourselves,\" Aybet added.\n\nHer comments were a stark contrast to a statement released by the White House Wednesday, in which US President Donald Trump said that Turkey was \"now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form.\"\n\n\"We expect Turkey to abide by all of its commitments, and we continue to monitor the situation closely,\" Trump said.\n\nAybet suggested that, when Erdogan visits the White House next month, the two leaders will discuss further details about dealing with the ISIS fighters.", "description": "Turkey's military has begun an operation in northern Syria to clear US-backed Kurdish forces away from its border.
