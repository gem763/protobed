Griffiths had been reluctant to include the secessionists the Southern Transitional Council in the talks process.\n\nBut the UN envoy will call for all sides to come together to hold wide-ranging political talks on the country\u2019s future, moving on from the narrow focus on security troop withdrawals in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, the primary focus of his diplomacy since an outline agreement was reached in Stockholm last December.\n\nBut diplomats fear Griffiths\u2019s appeal may be ignored if Saudi Arabia joins the US in attributing responsibility for the attack to a nexus between the Houthis and Iran. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2019s allies in the war to dislodge the Houthis, have signalled they are withdrawing some forces from Yemen, and there was hope that Saudi might wind down an unwinnable war.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Griffiths said he could not personally attribute responsibility for the attack, or substantiate the Houthi claim that they, rather than Iranian-backed rebels, fired the drones into Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe said: \u201cI really hope the US are right that it did not come from Yemen because it would make it more difficult than even what we are are now facing to resolve the conflict in Yemen.\u201d\n\nFor the Houthi claim of responsibility to be true, their armed drones would have had to fly over nearly 1,000km (621 miles) from Houthi-controlled territory in northwest Yemen across Saudi Arabia to reach their targets in Abqaiq.\n\nFew doubt the Houthis\u2019 drones capabilities have grown more sophisticated since they first claimed in February 2017 they were using drones for reconnaissance, surveying, assessment and early warning missions. But their basic drones do not have this range.\n\nIn August Yemen\u2019s operations command centre displayed the Samad-3 and the Qasef 2K drones, both of which had not been previously publicly displayed. It said the Samad-3 drone had a range of up to 1,700km and claimed the drones were used to attack the Abu Dhabi Airport and Dubai Airport, as well as in several other recent drone and missile attacks targeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s southern regions of Khamis Mushait and Jizan.\n\nEven if the US is right, and this attack was mounted from Southern Iraq, the drone threat posed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi forces is not going away. If the Saudis baulk at reprisals against Iran, they have proved over four years of war they will not, in the interests of their own perceived security, show the same restraint in Yemen.", "description": "Martin Griffiths urges parties to come to table and forge political agreement", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50cdbd1fbb2427acc8dfaca71f6e7c9d72f01991/0_260_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=38fa1ccf2aa1ec5ec4ee698da2f5506c", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
