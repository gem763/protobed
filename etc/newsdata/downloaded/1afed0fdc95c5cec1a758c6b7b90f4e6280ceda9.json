They were then compared to equally overweight women who had not had the surgery.\n\nScientists discovered mothers-to-be who had the life-changing procedure were 33 per cent less likely to have babies with defects.\n\nMost of the defects were heart-related - but they also involved the central nervous system, genitals, lungs and digestive systems.\n\nA gastric bypass involves creating a small pouch in the stomach that restricts food intake and reduces nutrient absorption\n\nObese women (file photo) who have their stomachs stapled smaller are 33 per cent less likely to give birth to babies with defects, Swedish scientists have found\n\nThe authors now say that contrary to suspicions, bariatric surgery does not hike the risk of birth defects - rather, it decreases them.\n\nThey say the reduced risk of child defects is down to the improvements in glucose metabolism and 'other beneficial physiologic changes'.\n\nHigh maternal body mass index and spiked glucose levels are associated with offspring deficiencies.\n\nBut RYGB is also associated with nutritional deficiencies and substance abuse, the authors claim.\n\nDr Martin Neovius and his team found birth defects in 3.4 per cent of babies born to mothers who had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).\n\nWhat is a gastric bypass? A laparoscopic gastric bypass, or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), is considered the 'gold standard' for weight-loss surgery. It involves creating a small pouch in the stomach that restricts food intake and reduces nutrient absorption. The pouch also limits food from coming into contact with the upper or lower intestine, further preventing absorption. The operation involves five-to-six incisions in the abdomen. Surgeons then staple the top portion of the stomach to separate it from the bottom, creating a pouch. A small section of the small intestine is then attached to the pouch, allowing food to bypass to the lower stomach.

However, the results from our study has to be confirmed in other settings.\n\n'And it is important to stress women need to take their recommended supplements after surgery.'\n\nHe added there is an increased risk of nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy, which may have adverse effects on the foetus.\n\nThe findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nGastric bypass surgery involves creating a small pouch in the stomach that restricts food intake.\n\nStudies show the procedure can shave off, on average, 77 per cent of a person's body weight within a year.\n\nBut, according to the Bariatric Surgery Center at the University of California, it can lead to people suffering iron deficiency due to insufficient nutrient absorption.", "description": "Researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, looked at data from nearly 33,000 women who weighed an average of 265lbs (120kg).", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19738544-0-image-a-24_1571144898470.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
