A fleet of humanoid robots is helping passengers find their way around.", "language": "en", "text": "Earlier this year, thousands of flights began landing at Istanbul\u2019s brand-new $11 billion airport, a sprawling behemoth that occupies an area larger than Manhattan and may eventually become the world\u2019s busiest air hub.\n\nHow do you help millions of harried passengers each year navigate an 818 million-square-foot facility with five concourses and 143 boarding gates.\n\nOne answer, according to airport officials, is a fleet of humanoid robots.\n\nSpecially designed for the new facility, the wheeled robots are a first for Turkish airports, according to an airport-produced video introducing the machines to the public. About the size of a small child, the eggshell-blue machines have bright digital faces with cartoonish round eyes and an ever-present smile that appears designed to put people at ease.\n\n[Three years ago it could barely walk. Now Atlas the humanoid robot is doing gymnastics.]\n\nWhen the robots speak, their mouths flash, their eyes wink and the machine\u2019s arms move up and down. A touch screen attached to the robot\u2019s chest allows customers to interact with the machine.\n\n\u201cMy capabilities include route showing, giving directions, inquiring about flight schedule and flight information status,\u201d the robot says between videos of the machine assisting customers and spinning in circles. \u201cI am looking forward to meeting new passengers at Istanbul Airport every day.\u201d\n\nThe Istanbul Airport video doesn\u2019t reveal whether the machines have a name or how many will roam the concourse, but Business Traveller reported that there are four robots on hand.\n\nAt a time when airports and the number of people passing through them continue to grow, the robots are an effort to make travel more manageable. When completed, Istanbul\u2019s airport \u2014 20 miles outside the city on the Black Sea coast \u2014 will be able to transport as many as 200 million passengers a year. For perspective, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta \u2014 currently considered the world\u2019s busiest \u2014 processes about half that number.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to arrive at scales which were previously unimaginable for the size of these airport buildings,\u201d Andrew Thomas, a partner at the architectural firm Grimshaw, which designed the Istanbul airport, told the New York Times last year. \u201cIt almost doesn\u2019t matter what you put in it if the walks are so long that people are exhausted by the time they get to their gate.\"\n\n[Friendly nurse or nightmare-inducing machine? How culture programs our taste in robots.]\n\nIstanbul\u2019s airport robots may be innovative and on trend, but they\u2019re not exactly groundbreaking.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of Pepper, for example. In addition to being spotted eerily tapping a drum while performing Buddhist funeral rites in Japan, the doe-eyed humanoid robot has also been interacting with British passengers at a railway station in central London (including posing for selfies). Pepper recently emerged at an airline in Taiwan, as well, it\u2019s shiny crown strikingly bald yet cheerful.\n\nAt one of France\u2019s busiest airports, self-driving robotic valets named \u201cStan\u201d have been parking travelers\u2019 vehicles for months, a process the company claims is far more efficient than human drivers.\n\nHumanoid robots on wheels with digital expressions have popped up in other busy, high-stress locations, such as hospitals.\n\nWhen officials at Mongkutwattana General Hospital in Bangkok needed help moving mountains of paperwork earlier this year, they turned to a fleet of humanoid robots, which they outfitted in bright yellow dresses and shoulder-length brown wigs.\n\nAdding an element of the supernatural, the unsmiling Chinese-made machines also have two blazing red eyes \u2014 each one massive and ghoulish \u2014 that glare from behind a darkened pane of transparent plastic like a demonic predator lurking in the dark.\n\nTheir names: Nan, Nee and Nim.\n\nMORE READING:\n\nAmazon is reportedly building a home robot.
