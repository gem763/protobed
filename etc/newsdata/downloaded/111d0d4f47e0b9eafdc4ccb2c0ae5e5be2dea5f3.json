The country slipped two places from last year\u2019s survey to end as the world\u2019s 14th most competitive economy, eclipsed by fellow developed nations United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden and Japan \u2014 among others. Canada had slipped two places in last year\u2019s survey, too.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s economy has been hit by external shocks stemming from global trade tensions. The less favourable economic environment has been reflected in somewhat more negative business leaders\u2019 views across several dimensions,\u201d the WEF said. \u201cFor instance, Canadian business leaders have revised down their assessment on two important aspects of competition: competition in services (where it ranks 62nd, losing 2.5 points in score and falling 18 places in rank), and the labour market (it ranks 54th on internal labour mobility, falling 25 places over 2018 and losing almost 4 points in score).\u201d\n\nThe WEF recommends improving ICT adoption, innovation capabilities if Canada is to emerge as a technological powerhouse.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in mobile broadband infrastructure and usage (67th), greater investments in R&D (23rd) and collaboration between companies, universities and research centres (15th) would benefit Canada\u2019s competitiveness going forward,\u201d WEF said.\n\nIn one key criteria \u2014 technology governance \u2014 Canada was ranked 27th in the world out of 141 countries, worse than Saudi Arabia (ranked 11th), China (24th) and India (25th). Canada also fared poorly in environment-related treaties in force (ranked 95th) and complexity of tariffs (ranked 97th). The country leads in macroeconomic stability (it shared the top spot with other countries) and corporate governance (4th).\n\nThe U.S. lost its coveted spot as the world\u2019s most competitive economy to Singapore.\n\nIf you have a moment, you really must give a listen to this week\u2019s Down to Business Podcast where Bruce Linton, the mercurial former CEO of Canopy Growth Corp. expounds on what Cannabis 2.0 and even 3.0 would look like.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s you need to know this morning:\n\nStatistics Canada to release crowd-sourced cannabis prices for the third quarter at 8:30 a.m. ET\n\nCanadian Wind Energy Association 35th annual CanWEA conference and exhibition in Calgary\n\nService Alberta Minister Nate Glubish to outline proposed amendments to the Real Estate Act\n\nStand.earth releases a report assessing the climate plans of the major federal political parties\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve releases minutes from its September 17-18 policy meeting, which are expected to show the depth of division among policymakers about the path ahead for interest rates\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George co-host \u201cFed Listens\u201d roundtable in Kansas\n\n\n\nBuilding permits rose 6.1 per cent in August to $9 billion, compared with a one per cent increase estimated by analysts, largely because of increases in multi-family and industrial permits, Statistics Canada reported. Quebec led the gains with more than a third of the value, while six other provinces reported increases, the agency said.\n\n\u201cOn the residential side, the number of units came in at 247,000 annualized in the month, flagging continued strength in housing starts down the road,\u201d wrote Robert Kavcic, senior economist, at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the year-to-date average for permits is a lofty 237k, so it looks like there\u2019s plenty in the pipeline to keep residential construction activity humming.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2014 Send your news, comments and stories to yhussain@postmedia.com. \u2014 Yadullah Hussain @YAD_Fpenergy\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canada-economy_gdp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
