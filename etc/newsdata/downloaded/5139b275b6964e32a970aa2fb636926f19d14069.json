No one was reported injured.\n\nViolence in Hong Kong has become more acute since the city's leader, Carrie Lam, used colonial-era emergency powers to ban citizens from wearing masks at public gatherings earlier this month. On Sunday, protesters dressed in black vandalized and set fire to government facilities, subway stations and shops deemed to be pro-China.\n\nSeveral incidents were caught on video, including one showing what appears to be a protester stabbing an officer in the neck with what police called a \"sharp-edged object.\" A group of protesters was also filmed attacking a lone officer in riot gear, with one delivering a jump kick to the neck.\n\n'50 years ago it was Berlin, today it's Hong Kong'\n\nBeijing has been particularly critical of Washington's support for the Hong Kong protesters in recent months, with authorities accusing the US of helping to organize demonstrations, claims the US State Department has called \"ridiculous.\"\n\nBeijing has also used its economic power to punish businesses and entities that don't toe the line. Recently the NBA's 30-plus year, multibillion-dollar relationship with Beijing was jeopardized by a single tweet from an NBA executive in support of the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nJUST WATCHED Gamer banned for supporting Hong Kong protests Replay More Videos ...

Fifty years ago it was Berlin, today it's Hong Kong,\" he said in a video filmed in front of Hong Kong's Legislative Council. \"The eyes of the world are on Hong Kong, and free people everywhere are standing with you.\"\n\nMy message for the Hong Kong Human Rights & Democracy Act protest today pic.twitter.com/R90KeObggJ \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 14, 2019\n\nSpeaking to a small group of journalists Sunday , Cruz said he believes Xi is \"terrified\" of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong because they pose an existential threat to the Communist Party.\n\nBeijing accused him of \"maliciously\" defaming Hong Kong and Chinese authorities.\n\n\"The Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, resolutely oppose liars like Cruz who came to Hong Kong to stir the pot,\" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\nHong Kong's protest movement began due to widespread concern over a proposed bill that would have legalized the extradition of suspects from Hong Kong who were accused of crimes in mainland China.\n\nNepal and China appear to be working on a similar agreement, which activists say could affect thousands of Tibetan refugees who are believed to have fled China's Communist rule and are now living in Nepal.\n\nA joint statement from Nepal and China, published Sunday by Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the two countries signed an agreement on mutual legal assistance and criminal matters and \"expressed hope for an early conclusion of the Treaty on Extradition.\"\n\nTibetan independence advocates fear the treaty could expose refugees to potential arrest and extradition to China.", "description": "Chinese President Xi Jinping warned adversaries on Sunday that any attempt to split China will \"end in crushed bodies and shattered bones\" according to state-media, as anti-government protesters in Hong Kong returned to the streets for a 19th consecutive weekend.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191013154250-hong-kong-protesters-xi-jinping-masks-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
