The company earned 6 cents a share versus a year earlier loss of $1.45 a share. Analysts expected 3 cents a share. Total sales surged 250% to $92 million, ahead of forecasts for $83 million.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on expanding our distribution footprint, both domestically and abroad, building our brand, introducing new innovative products into the marketplace, and bolstering our infrastructure and internal capabilities to fuel our future growth,\u201d Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown said in a statement.\n\nThe company raised its full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation estimate to $20 million from breakeven previously. Sales are also expected to be $25 million to $35 million higher than management\u2019s prior forecasts. It marks the second straight time Beyond Meat has raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts.\n\nEarnings are being ignored\n\nSomewhat oddly, Beyond Meat\u2019s stock traded down about 7% in the after-hours on the report. With a bear raid still apparently in effect on Beyond Meat\u2019s stock \u2014 further reflecting worries about insiders selling stock amid a looming lockup expiry \u2014 it\u2019s unfortunate its earnings are being completely ignored.\n\nThey really shouldn\u2019t be, however.\n\nFor starters, Beyond Meat\u2019s surprisingly profitable third quarter wasn\u2019t due to some movement of expenses around or one-time items. It was a good old-fashioned profitable quarter because of strong revenue growth and more efficient \u2014 and expanded \u2014 distribution. Beyond Meat\u2019s gross profit margin surged to 35.6% from 19.2% a year ago, underscoring that point. Secondarily, the quarter gives investors a tiny snapshot into how profitable the company could be as it secures more deals with restaurant chains, gains distribution space at retailers and rolls out more new products (such as chicken at fast-food restaurants, bacon and fish).\n\nFILE - In this June 27, 2019, file photo a meatless burger patty called Beyond Burger made by Beyond Meat is displayed at a grocery store in Richmond, Va.

This is not a cash hemorrhaging, money-losing Uber (UBER) business model here people. Eventually, the masses on Wall Street will return to that viewpoint \u2014 provided Beyond Meat keeps on tossing profitable quarters up on the board.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
