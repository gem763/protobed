Waze began testing the service, which matches commuters with others near them going to a similar destination, in Tel Aviv and the Bay Area in 2015 and 2016 respectively.\n\nHow it works: Unlike ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, Waze offers true carpooling for commuters. Even its pricing structure\u201454 cents per mile\u2014is designed to provide a simple compensation to the driver for gas, not a wage. Waze has also built a special app for the service, called Waze Rider. Waze eventually plans to start charging an additional fee to the rider.\n\nUber competition: In 2013, the same Alphabet acquired Waze for about $1 billion, the search giant also invested in Uber. Since then, the two companies have begun to compete increasingly, in areas such as self-driving cars, and now ride-sharing. Last year, Google executive David Drummond stepped down from Uber's board because of these growing conflicts of interests.", "description": "The Alphabet-owned Waze is increasingly competing with Uber and Lyft.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2017-12-15"}
