To listen to nobody but just yourself.\n\nWell, lucky for all of us, we are all at the right place. Treat this as a little nudge to not be afraid of doing things alone.\n\nBefore we begin, get inspired by DePaulo's words: \"If you know that you can do things alone, that gives you a certain power\".\n\nPexels\n\nWhy is spending time alone looked down upon by people? Why do people pity those who choose to do things alone? Why are people who chill just by themselves considered to be lonely?\n\nThe problem here is that we humans have thrived and survived because we are social animals. We need people for love and support. And all of that is okay. In no way are we encouraging you to stop talking to your friends, significant other and family. We want you to have those connections but at the same time, we want you to have a connection with yourself.\n\nWe really underestimate how much we do for others and how little we do for ourselves. For instance, I was dating this guy who always would just want to eat red-sauce pasta and I detested it. Plus, I din't want to waste food either by ordering a mixed sauce pasta for myself. So I was stuck eating red sauce pasta until I decided to go to my favourite Italian place all by myself and ordered my choice of pasta. It was honestly the best pasta I have ever eaten.\n\nMoral of this small story? When you put yourself first, two great things will happen. First, you will get to eat whatever your heart desires. Second, you will fall in love with yourself.\n\nUnsplash\n\nEver since that day, I have been doing things alone and they have probably been the best experiences of my life. I have gone mountain climbing, bungee jumping, trekked through Meghalaya, attended concerts alone, ate a zillion meals at some of the best restaurants all by myself. I have seen movies alone and realised what a bliss it is to not have someone chit chatting. I have drank a million of coffees alone too.\n\nAnd while I spent so much time alone, I realised I am my own best friend. My own boyfriend if you will. No one loves me as much as I love myself and now I love spending time with myself.\n\nPexels\n\nThe truth we all have to accept is, that not everyone will want to go where you want to go. Not everyone will eat what you want to eat. Not everyone will be available for a spontaneous trip halfway across the country. Don't let these people hold you back. Don't put your life on hold just because you have no one to go and do things you love with.\n\nGo ahead and do everything your heat desires alone. Give your soul what it needs. Don't be afraid to do things alone. Happiness awaits you. And don't forget: DePaulo's words: \"If you know that you can do things alone, that gives you a certain power\".", "description": "The truth we all have to accept is, that not everyone will want to go where you want to go.
