Photo: Zoe Postman\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs has approached the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to help it clear the 150 000 refugee status appeals backlog, according to Director of Asylum Seekers, Mandla Madumisa.\n\nMadumisa was speaking at the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Thursday, GroundUp reports.\n\nThe SAHRC subpoenaed Acting Home Affairs Director-General, Thulani Mavuso, to address complaints that the department takes an inordinately long time to process asylum applications and permanent residence permits.\n\nSAHRC chairperson Bongani Majola, said his institution had struggled to engage with Home Affairs for the past year so a subpoena was necessary.\n\nMajola said: \"Home Affairs is a central structure that affects so many people's lives.\"\n\nA working relationship should be established between the commission and Home Affairs so that individual cases could be dealt with efficiently, he said.\n\nProgress\n\nMajola asked Home Affairs representatives if any progress had been made on the backlog of refugee appeals.\n\nMadumisa said a consultant from UNHRC was appointed and started in May. The consultant would assess the situation at Home Affairs and would come up with a comprehensive plan to deal with the backlog.\n\n\"By the end of July the department will receive that report and we will have a clear way forward on how we will deal with the backlog,\" he said.\n\nMavuso said Home Affairs also struggled with the verification of information when it came to spousal visa applications. He said the turnaround time for the department is currently eight months but he said it was looking into extending it to 18 months.\n\n\"Eight months becomes a challenge because an adjudicator cannot touch an application before the inspector can put a stamp on the verification of information including supporting documents,\" he said.\n\nHe said this meant that the inspectors would need to do various interviews and confirm that the information presented to Home Affairs is verified.\n\n\"You have cases where people submit police clearance documents but the documents have been totally manipulated\u2026 so because of the constraints on the ground of the inspectors, we will have to ensure that the [turn around] period increases,\" he told the panel.\n\nMavuso said the turnaround time depended on whether the information provided was easily verified.\n\nSAHRC commissioner Angie Makwetla asked Mavuso whether Home Affairs kept the applicants informed on the status of their application \"because a person can't wait from 2016 to 2018 and not know what is happening\".", "description": "The Department of Home Affairs has approached the United Nations Human Rights Council to help it clear the 150 000 refugee status appeals backlog.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8880/98d0ffd1b8c842caa4da1a032934408e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
