In fact, the Republican described his perception of the Democrats\u2019 tactics.\n\n\u201c[T]hey\u2019re of the opinion, you know, just keep saying it, saying it, saying it, and maybe someday they\u2019ll believe it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt was a curious failure of self-awareness for the president. He was, after all, describing one of his most commonly used tactics and attributing it to his critics. And therein lies the rub: as the walls close in on Trump, projection remains his go-to move.\n\nA few days later, the president hosted a White House meeting with congressional leaders, which was derailed by what some participants described as Trump\u2019s \u201cmeltdown.\u201d After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Americans should \u201cpray for his health,\u201d the Republican responded in his patented I\u2019m-rubber-you\u2019re-glue sort of way, published a tweet accusing Pelosi of being mentally ill, and added, \u201cPray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d\n\nSince he heard the Speaker accuse him of a \u201cmeltdown,\u201d Trump also accused Pelosi of having had a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nAll of which led to the Republican\u2019s campaign rally last night in Texas, held just a few hours after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged the White House\u2019s quid-pro-quo scheme with Ukraine. Trump responded by accusing Joe Biden of trying to execute a quid-pro-quo scheme in Ukraine.\n\nTrump said that the former vice president was in charge of Ukraine policy for the Obama administration and sought the firing of the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general while his son, Hunter \u201cwas paid massive sums of money [to] buy a Ukrainian energy company.\u201d \u201cNow that\u2019s what you call quid pro quo,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNo, in reality, it\u2019s not. Biden, with bipartisan and international backing, urged Ukraine to dismiss an inept prosecutor who wasn\u2019t investigating the Ukrainian company in question. It bears literally no resemblance to a quid pro quo.\n\nBut the fact that the president is pushing the fraudulent line anyway brings a simple truth into focus: Trump genuinely seems to believe he can \u201cno puppet\u201d his way through his impeachment crisis.\n\nI hope you caught Rachel\u2019s segment last week on Trump\u2019s dependence on the rhetorical ploy: \u201cWhat we have already started living through here is an effort \u2026 to turn the behavior for which the president has now been caught, not just into some amorphous and unnecessarily complicated thing that doesn\u2019t really have any inherent meaning, but also to try to make his sins our sins. To try to absolve himself of his own crimes by putting what he did and \u2013 what he and his sort of henchmen in Ukraine have been doing \u2013 to try to put those crimes on everybody else\u2019s rap sheet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s become a staple of Trump\u2019s presidency. As regular readers know, the Republican has a playbook for defending himself, and projection is the first page.\n\nA couple of months ago, for example, Trump faced condemnations after using racist rhetoric against four Democratic congresswomen of color. The president responded by accusing the congresswomen of being racists.\n\nA couple of months before that, following a series of bizarre incidents, Trump was accused of mental decline. He responded by accusing Nancy Pelosi of being in mental decline.\n\nCircling back to our earlier coverage, it\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s come to define his entire approach to politics: like an intemperate child, Trump\u2019s I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I instincts are finely tuned after extensive practice.\n\nWhen Democrats accused the president of a variety of crimes, Trump insisted the \u201creal crimes were committed\u201d by Democrats. When Dems argued the president obstructed justice, Trump replied that it\u2019s the Dems who have obstructed justice.\n\nConfronted with allegations that his political operation colluded with Russian attackers, Trump said Democrats colluded with Russia. Told that the Kremlin supported his candidacy, Trump responded by saying Russia supported Democrats. Accused of being a manipulated pawn for Vladimir Putin, Trump accused Barack Obama of being Putin\u2019s \u201cpatsy.\u201d\n\nAnd during the 2016 campaign: whenever Hillary Clinton would criticize Trump, it was a near certainty that Trump would then make the identical accusation against Clinton. After a while, as regular readers may recall, this got a little creepy.\n\nClinton accused Trump of being unstable and reckless, so Trump said Clinton is \u201cunstable\u201d and \u201creckless.\u201d Clinton said Trump mistreated women, so Trump said Clinton mistreated women. Clinton accused Trump of bigotry, so Trump said Clinton\u2019s a \u201cbigot.\u201d Clinton questioned Trump\u2019s temperament, so Trump said Clinton had a bad \u201ctemperament.\u201d Clinton said Trump makes a poor role model for children, so Trump said Clinton sets \u201ca terrible example for my son and the children in this country.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, Clinton accused Trump of being a \u201cpuppet\u201d for his allies in Moscow during a 2016 debate. Trump, showing all of the sophistication of a slow toddler, responded, \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet. No, you\u2019re the puppet.\u201d\n\nWith a track record like this one, is it really any wonder Trump is falsely accusing Biden of a quid pro quo?", "description": "Donald Trump genuinely seems to believe he can \"no puppet\" his way through his impeachment crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_bwms_maddow1_191017_1920x1080.jpg?itok=JwFyXEWT", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
