It says it is at an impasse with the school on issues including pay, benefits and protections from discrimination.\n\nMembers voted 2,425 to 254 over the past week to give the bargaining committee the power to call a strike.\n\nThe school says that it has been negotiating in good faith and that calls for a strike are unwarranted.\n\nThe vote comes after a ruling last month by the National Labor Relations Board overturning a 2016 decision that gave graduate students at private schools the status of employees and the right to form a union.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
