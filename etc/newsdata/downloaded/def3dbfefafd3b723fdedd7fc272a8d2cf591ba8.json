Because the first reaction is to come out denying everything...\n\n'But when I saw the way I was objectified and dragged through the press, I can't believe that if I looked a different way or I was a man. So I'm not going to answer that.'\n\nMs Arcuri said Mr Johnson had never showed her 'any favouritism' and denied newspaper reports he wrote her a letter of recommendation for a \u00a3100,000-a-year tech job.\n\nAsked again whether she had an 'intimate relationship' with the former mayor, she again refused to answer. 'Because the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I am really not going to answer that question,' she said.\n\n'I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer. Boris had nothing to do with my other achievements.'\n\nMs Arcuri winked at the camera as she had her make-up done before her exclusive interview with Good Morning Britain today\n\nMr Johnson and Ms Arcuri pictured together on October 14, 2014. The PM is facing intense scrutiny about their relationship\n\nMs Arcuri was grilled on how many times Mr Johnson visited her house when he was mayor, but refused to give a straight answer.\n\n'I'm not really sure how many times he came to visit,' she said. 'He visited a handful of times over a few years\u2026 I don't really know how many...'\n\nAsked to be specific by Piers, she answered: 'Five times? Ten times? A handful of times\u2026 I told you a handful of times, let's say five.'\n\nThe businesswoman described Mr Johnson as 'a really good friend' and added: 'It's really not anyone's business what private life we had.'\n\nOn October 2, Ms Arcuri broke her cover and was pictured outside a beauty salon, run by her friend, near her home in Los Angeles\n\nEarlier this week Ms Arcuri broke her cover and was pictured outside a beauty salon, run by her friend, near her home in Los Angeles.\n\nWearing heavy make-up and a wide-brimmed black hat, she rubbished allegations Mr Johnson had bent the rules to help her \u2013 calling it 'an orchestrated attack'.\n\nSpeaking to the Mail 11 days after the scandal emerged, she insisted: 'I'm being used as collateral. All the allegations are false.'\n\nAs she sat next to her friend Jeannie Lorin, who runs the Beauty Society salon, Ms Arcuri added: 'It's such a shame to see successful businesswomen, or just businesswomen in general, be persecuted.'\n\nShe added: 'One of the things I've been surprised with is how much support there has been for me, despite these allegations, because women see through these attacks and they know the narrative.'\n\nFriends said she had been lying low with extended family elsewhere in the US while deciding how to respond to the clamour.\n\nMs Arcuri was pictured Boris Johnson on his mayoral campaign in 2012 when her firm ran large sums of public money\n\nThere are four inquiries into whether father-of-five Mr Johnson broke rules by doing favours for Ms Arcuri and her tech firms.\n\nMs Arcuri moved to California last year with British partner Matthew Hickey and their young daughter.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2015 she was 'very close' to Mr Johnson, who would visit her Shoreditch flat \u2013 which had a dancing pole\u2013 for private 'technology lessons'.\n\nLast night a friend said: 'She is still deciding how best to get her side of the story across.\n\n'She is an astute and serious businesswoman and knows she needs to regain control of this situation.'\n\nAnd Mr Johnson could be forced to hand over text messages and emails he sent to the businesswoman or face prison.\n\nIf the leader fails to respond to the summons, he could be handed a sentence of up to three months in prison.\n\nThe pole-dancing American tech entrepreneur was previously photographed draped in a Union Jack in 2013\n\nMs Arcuri was said to have been a 27-year-old student at the time of applying for the \u00a3100,000 a year job.\n\nIn an email leaked to The Sunday Times, she allegedly later wrote: 'I still have the letter of rec from Boris. hahaha. To think that we asked him to write us a recommendation for the CEO of Tech City is just hysterical.'\n\nShe listed 'Boris Johnson, Mayor of London' as a reference on the application, according to the paper.\n\nOn Twitter Sunday Times reporter Gabriel Pogrund posted: 'A little morsel that didn't make it into the paper.\n\n'From 2012 - 2014, Jennifer Arcuri used the following email signature to sign off correspondence with friends, MPs and trade officials: 'Sent from the most awesome iPad in the world!'\n\nLast month, Mr Johnson was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his association with the businesswoman.\n\nIt follows reports by the same paper that Ms Arcuri was given \u00a3126,000 in public money and privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.\n\nMr Johnson could be forced to hand over text messages and emails he sent to Miss Arcuri or face prison\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror this week Ms Arcuri furiously denied claims that she had a sexual relationship with Mr Johnson and branded rumours 'complete b*******'.\n\nShe added: 'They fall in love with me in about ten minutes\u2026 because I know what to say. I make men trip over their d****'.\n\nWhen asked if Boris Johnson had contacted her since the scandal emerged she said: 'No. Can you blame him?'\n\nA media bidding war was reportedly underway last week for the exclusive rights to a tell-all interview.\n\nMicheal Walsh, a Californian-based lawyer, who claims to represent Ms Arcuri, said five media outlets were in the running with $225,000 the highest bid on Thursday.\n\nMr Walsh said there was a queue of 'interested parties' but 'the price had to be right'.\n\n'She's hot right now and you've got to strike while the iron's hot,' he told The Times.\n\nThe US lawyer, who claims to have known Ms Arcuri for 14 years, said the tech entrepreneur would give a 'far and wide-ranging interview'.", "description": "American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri has been at the centre of a storm over her relationship with Boris Johnson.
