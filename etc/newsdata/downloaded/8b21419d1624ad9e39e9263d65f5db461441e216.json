Tawanna Gaines (D-Prince George\u2019s) and then-Prince George\u2019s County Executive Rushern L. Baker III during a meeting in Annapolis in 2011. Gaines abruptly resigned on Friday. (Mark Gail/The Washington Post)\n\nLongtime Maryland delegate Tawanna P. Gaines, a Democrat from Prince George\u2019s County who has served in House leadership, was charged with federal wire fraud on Monday, accused of using $22,000 of campaign funds for personal expenses.\n\nGaines, 67, abruptly resigned from the legislature on Friday.\n\nAccording to court documents, she is accused of defrauding her campaign account, \u201cFriends of Tawanna P. Gaines,\u201d by soliciting donations that were directed to a PayPal account which was not disclosed in state campaign finance filings.\n\nThe documents say the charge involves a \u201cwire communication sent out of Maryland regarding a $125 cash withdrawal from the FTPG Pay Pal account.\u201d\n\nIf convicted, Gaines faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. Prosecutors said she is expected to appear Oct. 17 in U.S. District Court for Maryland in Greenbelt. Through her lawyer, she declined an interview request.\n\n\u201cAs elected officials, we have an obligation to uphold the public trust, both in office and in our campaigns,\u201d House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County) said in a statement Monday morning announcing Gaines\u2019s resignation. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice that trust for personal gain for ourselves or our family members.\u201d\n\n\n\nA 2006 photo of then-Del. Tawanna P. Gaines (D-Prince George\u2019s) (courtesy of Tawanna-P. Gaines)\n\nGaines, who has served in the General Assembly since December 2001, is at least the fifth Democratic politician from Maryland to face criminal charges related to financial misconduct in the past two years.\n\nIn 2018, former delegates Michael Vaughn and William A. Campos, also from Prince George\u2019s, were sentenced to 4 and 4 \u00bd years in federal prison, respectively, for a pay-to-play bribery scheme involving liquor licenses.\n\nAlso that year, former state senator Nathaniel Oaks, of Baltimore City, was sentenced to 3 \u00bd years for a bribery scheme related to a developer.\n\nIn 2017, Gary Brown, also of Baltimore, was sentenced to probation for illegally bypassing state campaign finance limits while working for then-Baltimore mayoral candidate Catherine Pugh. He was charged days before he was scheduled to be sworn in to the House seat that became vacant as a result of Pugh being elected mayor.\n\nGaines built a reputation as a hardworking and thoughtful legislator during her 18 years in the legislature. When Jones became speaker earlier this year, after a bitter intraparty battle, she put Gaines in charge of negotiating how to spend the state\u2019s $2 billion capital budget.\n\nThe announcement of her resignation Monday stunned colleagues, who said Gaines loved being in state government.\n\n\u201cI was shocked, to put it mildly,\u201d said Sen. Paul G. Pinsky (D-Prince George\u2019s), who represents the same district. When he learned the resignation was tied to potential campaign finance impropriety, Pinsky added, \u201cI was even more taken aback. She has probably been one of the least prolific fundraisers.\u201d\n\nBut Gaines repeatedly flouted campaign finance rules over more than a decade. Regulators have cited her 13 times since 2006 and fined her more than $2,000 for book-keeping errors in her campaign finance reports, records show. The infractions include failing to file, filing late or not responding to audits. In 2016, she was referred to the Office of the State Prosecutor, the state agency that oversees corruption.\n\nIn the legislature, Gaines was praised as a strong advocate for investing in transportation and in Prince George\u2019s County. She served as Deputy Majority Whip from 2003 to 2007, as vice chair of the Prince George\u2019s County House delegation from 2007 to 2008 and as Assistant Majority Leader in 2015.\n\nGaines began her political career as a member of the Berwyn Heights town council in the late 1990s. She was the first African American elected to the council, and in 2000 became the first woman to serve as mayor.\n\nAfter being appointed to a vacant House seat in 2001, Gaines was elected to a full four-year term in 2002. In 2009, she received a distinguished legislator award from the Maryland Municipal League. In 2015, she was given the Casper R. Taylor Jr. Founder\u2019s Award, which honors a delegate who serves with integrity and a focus on public service.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, I accepted the resignation of Delegate Tawanna P. Gaines,\u201d Jones said in her statement. \u201c... I wish Delegate Gaines the best during this challenging time.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story. It will continue to be updated as new information is available.\n\nLynh Bui contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones \u2018knows how to get people to behave themselves\u2019\n\nHouse speaker\u2019s race leaves bitter taste in Prince George\u2019s County\n\nPrince George\u2019s pit-bull ban: Racist and ineffective?
