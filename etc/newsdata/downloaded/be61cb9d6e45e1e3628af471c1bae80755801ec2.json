Photo: Marvel Entertainment\n\nNot so long ago, it was touch and go for the X-Men. Their adventures in the pages of Marvel Comics were hardly making a dent in the minds of the average reader. This may have been by design, to a certain extent, possibly owing to the fact that Marvel\u2019s parent company, Disney, didn\u2019t have the X-characters\u2019 film rights. Although there\u2019s never been formal confirmation of this policy, it\u2019s long been said that Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter issued an edict at some point in the 2010s: Screw the X-Men. Though those rumors are probably more extreme than what actually happened \u2014 there was still A-list talent being put on the X-books here and there, like writer Brian Michael Bendis or artist Stuart Immonen \u2014 you couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Marvel was spending far more money and energy on fostering titles that starred characters who also appeared in Disney\u2019s Marvel movies. Whatever the reason, the X-Men series stopped presenting big, grabby ideas. Even when talented writers were assigned to guide the mutants, the stories felt like empty nostalgia exercises filled with half-hearted quips and small-scale threats. Nothing was catching on.\n\nWell, suffice it to say that all that\u2019s changed, and it turns out that all it took was the deft, firm hand of a 46-year-old former architecture student. Jonathan Hickman \u2014 a lifelong geek trained in the art of designing buildings before he worked in advertising and then decided to try his hand at comics writing in the mid-aughts \u2014 recently took over scribe duties on Marvel\u2019s X-Men comics. Reading them now is like falling in love after years of luckless dating. Hop onto Twitter on a given Wednesday, the day new comic-book issues come out, and you\u2019ll find the tag \u201c#xspoilers\u201d \u2014 so named because users can mute all tweets with that tag if they haven\u2019t had a chance to read the new issue yet and aren\u2019t ready to join the conversation. But when they are ready, what a conversation there is to be had. People are screenshotting their favorite moments left and right, tossing out their theories about where it\u2019s all going, dissecting all the metaphors and references, and just generally squealing over how into it they are: \u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about what this issue MEANS for a long time but I could spend hours just talking about how it LOOKS,\u201d they say; or \u201cit\u2019s just fucking fantastic\u201d; or simply, \u201cTHIS IS SOME WILD SHIT.\u201d\n\nThis kind of broad-based positive consensus about a superhero comic is a rare thing \u2014 yes, there have been series that were widely praised in recent years, but the response from critics and fans for the nascent Hickman X-Men run has been especially pronounced. He\u2019s launched this new stage of the X-mythos with a story that\u2019s divided into two miniseries, House of X and Powers of X, which is actually pronounced \u201cpowers of ten\u201d for reasons that I won\u2019t spoil for you. But that kind of playfulness with form and language is emblematic of what Hickman does best.\n\nHe\u2019d been raised on comics, and one set of characters, in particular, had always appealed to him: the (not-so-)merry Marvel mutants known as the X-Men. \u201cIt\u2019s the Marvel comic I read growing up \u2014 the one I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u201d he tells Vulture. However, it took him 12 years of professional comics writing to get around to writing them. He started his comics career with strange, high-concept indie titles at Image Comics, then got a bump up to Marvel a decade ago to write the series Secret Warriors and Fantastic Four. The latter of those two titles was what made him a star, and it did so abruptly. His time with the FF \u2014 the first superheroes of the Marvel Age of Comics back in the 1960s \u2014 was a joyous and intriguing one from the very beginning. He wove big ideas into wild adventures, and the whole endeavor felt as fresh as it was respectful of the characters\u2019 long legacy. Fans and critics devoured it.\n\nAs the years went on, it became clear that Hickman\u2019s vision was too big for one set of characters. He wrote a series called S.H.I.E.L.D., which audaciously rewrote the history of the entire Marvel Universe by establishing its roots in the actions of figures like Michelangelo, da Vinci, and Tesla. He reinvigorated the ailing Ultimate Marvel experiment. He was assigned to the tales of the Avengers and took them to the ends of time and space. What\u2019s more, all of these stories linked up with one another, effectively creating a kind of Hickmanverse within the Marvel U. It all culminated in one of the best superhero crossovers in history, the jaw-droppingly ambitious Secret Wars. And then, it seemed, his time with the superheroes was over. He left Marvel in 2016 and dedicated his efforts to his various creator-owned Image titles, seemingly content to tend his own garden and get weirder and weirder with characters he created and owned, alongside his artist collaborators. We counted ourselves lucky that we\u2019d been able to see him experiment with what superhero fiction could be but didn\u2019t hold out much hope we\u2019d ever see him do it again.\n\nExcerpt from House of X No. 1.

What\u2019s more, the gossip was that he\u2019d be taking on the woefully abused X-Men. From the 1980s through the mid-aughts, the X-titles had been Marvel\u2019s flagships, outselling just about everything else on the market and establishing a mythology whose popularity catapulted them first into a successful Saturday-morning cartoon show and then a megahit film series. However, that film series proved to be their undoing. Owing to various machinations not worth getting into here, 20th Century Fox owned the movie rights to the X-Men, and when Marvel started making its own movies with the characters whose rights it still retained circa 2008 (the ones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe), the company had an incentive to promote the Avengers characters more than the mutants.\n\nThose days are gone. Two things, which may or may not be related, happened in recent months: The Disney/Fox merger meant the X-Men were back in the film family, and Hickman was announced as the writer of House of X and Powers of X in March. This summer\u2019s San Diego Comic-Con brought news that the miniseries would be followed by a new line of X-Men titles, with Hickman writing the main book and others operating under his guidance for secondary series. We waited with bated breath to see what could happen. Finally, in late July of this year, House of X No. 1 dropped. It was an immediate sensation. There have only been a few subsequent issues of the run \u2014 the House of X No. 5 came out yesterday \u2014 but geeks have been poring over every page like it\u2019s a new Gospel.\n\nThe basic setup is as follows: The X-Men, led by mutant telepathic genius Charles Xavier, have decided to form their own sovereign state on the island of Krakoa, a living geographic entity that has its own mutant powers and has been part of the X-Men mythos for a long while. This turn of events upsets the balance of global politics and economics, and, although the mutants seem to have created a self-governed utopia, we have swiftly been shown, through time-jumps in subsequent issues, that everything is destined to go horribly wrong.\n\nThese are not wholly unfamiliar tropes for X-Men die-hards, but Hickman, pencilers Pepe Larraz and R.B. Silva, colorist Marte Gracia, letterer Clayton Cowles, and designer Tom Muller have turned them all on their heads and crafted something that feels new. Let us dwell for a second on that last job title: designer. In Hickman\u2019s Image series The Black Monday Murders, he toyed with the very foundation of the comics medium by interspersing typical words-pictures-panels sequences with pages and pages of innovative, text-based portions that are arranged with sleek charts and graphs to resemble dossiers on what you\u2019re reading. They\u2019re not mere grace notes, either \u2014 key information is presented in those pages, and their presence makes you wonder just how far mainstream sequential art can go.\n\nNobody has any idea where all of this is going, but fans are rabidly spewing out speculation in Comics Twitter, Reddit, and blog posts. Hickman is confident that he won\u2019t end up hampered by fandom like the creators of, say, Westworld or Lost, whose shows were overwhelmed by followers desperate to identify future twists. \u201cI don\u2019t really construct stories that way,\u201d he says. \u201cI think if you\u2019re serious about this stuff, it became very obvious during Lost just how intelligent a million viewers working to solve puzzles are. The way you do it is to withhold the information necessary to solve the mystery until right before you narratively present the solution.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s all reasonably accessible for the legions of casual X-Men fans who gave up reading the characters after the last truly revolutionary X-run, that of writer Grant Morrison in 2001\u20134. I can\u2019t really speak to whether a brand-new reader of superhero comics will be able to enjoy what\u2019s going on, but if you\u2019re prepared to peruse a few Wikipedia pages and mostly just let the aesthetics and ideas wash over you, you should be fine.\n\nAnd those ideas are fascinating. You\u2019ve got meditation on the parallels between the development of artificial intelligence and the evolution of biological organisms. There are explorations of the righteousness and horror of political terrorism. We\u2019re looking at the ways in which the powerful condescendingly extend sympathy to those they are oppressing. Most important, there is a ton of stuff going on about the vital importance and mortal danger of a threatened minority group seeking self-determination and liberation. These are all questions that feel vitally necessary in our present troubled age. Hickman has both found the Zeitgeist and seems to be altering it at the same time. We needed the X-Men, and now \u2014 thank the mutant gods \u2014 they\u2019re back.", "description": "For years, the X-Men languished in their comic-book adventures. But now, all-star writer Jonathan Hickman has taken over the series and fans and critics are going nuts.
