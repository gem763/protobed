It first appeared on scmp.com on Sept. 6, 2019.\n\nNearly a thousand alumni and students across Hong Kong added their voices to a citywide protest on Friday, as demonstrators called on the government to meet all their demands and do more than just withdrawing the extradition bill.\n\nThey formed human chains outside schools in Kowloon Tong, Tai Po and on Hong Kong Island, and asked other students to join them to put pressure on Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor\u2019s administration.\n\nProtesters want an independent investigation into the use of force by police, an amnesty for arrested protesters, a halt to categorizing the protests as riots, and the implementation of universal suffrage.\n\nTheir show of defiance continued despite Lam\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill that has sparked months of protests in the city.\n\nWith Lam only acceding to one of the demonstrators' five demands, protesters and politicians from both sides of the divide have said the move was too little, too late.\n\nIn Kowloon Tong, more than 500 men and women wearing masks and dark clothes lined the walls surrounding the neighborhood\u2019s elite schools, La Salle College, Bishop Hall Jubilee School, Jockey Club Government Secondary School, and Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Wong Fut Nam College.\n\nThe demonstrators, most of whom were alumni, chanted school anthems and popular anti-government cheers, such as \u201cthere are no rioters, only a tyrannical regime,\u201d and \u201cHongkongers, add oil.\u201d\n\nSome students in school uniforms also joined the effort to form a human chain.\n\nThe rally extended about 700 meters along the narrow, tree-lined pavement around two blocks, situated in an otherwise quiet middle-class neighborhood with low-rise residential buildings.\n\n\u201cEven though Lam announced she would withdraw the bill, the decision should have come three months earlier. I hope she will respond to more of our demands,\u201d said one La Salle College graduate, who wished to remain nameless.\n\nMore than 70 students skipped classes on Monday and Tuesday, according to Chan, a member of the school\u2019s student concern group, who would only give his last name.\n\nDespite that the Education Bureau did not want to see a school boycott, education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said he would leave it to schools to handle the matter themselves according to their own judgment. Many schools allow students to skip classes if they have the permission letters from parents.\n\nChan, a Form Six student at La Salle, said the turnout was bigger than expected. The school had the largest crowd of the four schools, with more than 300 people involved.\n\nMeanwhile, a handful of teachers stood at the gate of each of the schools, watching in silence.\n\n\u201cThe students are very restrained and peaceful, so I\u2019m not too worried that anything radical might happen,\u201d said Andrew Lau, deputy principal of Bishop Hall Jubilee School.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about is that the government has lost the hearts of a generation of young people, and that they might walk further away from the government.\u201d\n\nTeachers at the school were opposed to the strike, and the pupils had been largely obedient, Lau said, who added that there was no class boycott at the school.\n\nIn Tai Po, more than 300 people, including students and alumni from seven secondary schools, and residents and pupils from neighboring schools, formed a human chain stretching across Tat Wan Road.\n\nAccording to the students, 100 students from Kau Yan College went on strike on Monday, and 20 from Law Ting Pong Secondary School went on strike on Thursday.\n\n\u201cTaking part is the only thing I can do as a secondary school student to call for the government to meet the five demands,\u201d said a 17-year-old Form Six student at Law Ting Pong Secondary School, who gave his name as Anson.\n\nProtesters chanted popular slogans such as \u201cliberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\u201d and \u201creturn the eye\u201d, referring to a young woman who suffered a severe eye injury during a violent protest in August.\n\nThe crowd gathered at Tai Po Market MTR station around 6:45 a.m. and left just before 8 a.m. so pupils could go to class on time.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go on the front lines, but we can still yell slogans and show others that many secondary school pupils are aware of the protests and are also fighting for the five demands,\u201d said a 16-year-old Form Six student from neighboring Kau Yan College surnamed Ng.", "description": "The Hong Kong school boycott continued as hundreds turned out in support and called on Carrie Lam to meet all demands made by anti-government protesters.", "authors": ["Cannix Yau", "South China Morning Post", "Yujing Liu", "Gigi Choy", "Rhea Mogul"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HsBpQu7WAwjcY8egWlGkew--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/8f756af26badebfcecfb7c8698ce2020", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
