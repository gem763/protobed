Boston Fed President Rosengren took an indirect aim at the postponed IPO of WeWork/WeCo that couldn\u2019t takeoff even at a quarter of its private market value; WeCo junk bond fell to 96.57. The model of getting long leases and then leasing them out short is inherently risky and banks may be stuck with defaulted loans/mortgages. The Fed has the difficult task of balancing calls for zero/negative rates vs 50-yr low unemployment rate and stocks near all-time highs.\n\nWall Street is worried about the presidential candidacy of Elizabeth Warren; in polls for 20 Democratic nominees, #1-Biden, #2-Warren, #3-Sanders. In online betting market, Warren is ahead of Biden [who may be his own worst enemy]. Warren\u2019s agenda includes breaking up companies, hiking taxes, regulating financial/banking industry, Medicare for all, etc. These would be negative for equities in general, but especially for pharma, healthcare, financials, big tech, defense, energy. Economy and geopolitics will be key issues for the elections in 2020.\n\nPg 13, Streetwise: Streaming rights for shows are going for crazy prices. Show producers get 30-40% cut. These may be loss-leaders as there is tough competition among streaming subscription services [ Disney+ , HBO Max , Peacock , Viacom/CBS xyz , Apple TV+ , etc].\n\nPg 14-15: Climate Week NYC starts on Monday. Senate antitrust panel looks at big techs swallowing smaller rivals on Tuesday. President Trump addresses the UN General Assembly in NYC on Tuesday.\n\nIn 4 interventions last week in the m-mkts to control the repo rates, the Fed deployed $275 billion \u2013 i.e. it added Treasuries valued that much to its balance sheet and injected that much cash into the repo market.\n\nUBER and LYFT drivers may benefit by switching to used Toyota Prius hybrids that have low per mile costs.\n\nNKE [+17% YTD] is doing well in a poor retail environment.\n\nData this week: Chicago Fed national activity index on Monday; consumer confidence survey, housing index on Tuesday; new home sales on Wednesday; pending home sales, final Q2 GDP on Thursday; durable goods orders, personal income and spending, PCE deflator, consumer sentiment on Friday.\n\nClosed: Japan on Monday [again].\n\nBullish Recommendations: Lower risk Steady Eddie stocks [Growth MSFT, JNJ, EHC, FANG, FB; cyclicals CMCSA, DAL; pg 23];\n\nluxury resale online retailer RealReal [REAL; June IPO; no profits; REAL keeps 15-60% of the proceeds from the sale of consigned items; 36% of float is short; lockup expires Dec 24; pg 25].\n\nBearish Recommendations: None self standing\n\nPg 16: Attack on Saudi oil facilities knocked off almost 60% of production. But after the initial spike of 12-15% in oil prices, they came down; oil is down -18% YTD. But this was no black-swan event, may be a pond-duck. Reasons: Saudi Arabia said that it may restore production by the end of September but that may be too optimistic; excess global oil production capacity; global oil reserves [1.55 billion barrels with governments (15 days of global demand), 3.1 billion barrels with oil companies (30 days of global demand)]. Going forward, there may be $3-5 geopolitical risk premium \u2013 if Saudi oil facilities can be attacked, other oil facilities are also vulnerable. There may also be a floor to oil prices. While oil remains in bearish trend, it is dangerous to short it. Investors need a long term approach to oil/energy.\n\nPg 18: Cover Story, \u201cThe Opioid Crisis Could Hurt Investors. Here\u2019s How\u201d. Beware of opioid exposure of drug manufacturers [JNJ, TEVA, MNK, MYL, etc], distributors [CAH, MCK, ABC, etc], pharmacies [CVS, WBA], PBMs. While the opioids are legal potent painkillers, they are often prescribed excessively [and those patients sell them to others] or supplied illegally. Governments and private groups are suing companies for the health costs from opioid abuse. Private Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy; JNJ lost a case that it is appealing. Lawyers don\u2019t want the bankruptcy outcome but want settlements for \u201cglobal peace\u201d. Many generics manufacturers with opioid exposure have high debt and are quite vulnerable. Drug distribution is a triopoly in the US, and as they face scrutiny, AMZN is looking to move into this area as a disruptor.\n\nPg 26: The Fed has cut rates but hasn\u2019t become a dove. The Fed Chair Powell has called this midcycle adjustment rather than the start of a new easing cycle. The current fed fund rate of 1.75-2.00% should be evaluated relative to the neutral rate that is unknowable in advance [or, alternatively, the inflation rate]. Also, think of Fed\u2019s economic projections more as targets and less as forecasts. Although one more cut may be expected by the yearend, the Fed is quite split on the rate outlook in 2020 and is way out of sync from the fed fund futures market.\n\nPg 27: SoftBank Group [SFTBY] is attractive at large discount to its sum-of-parts valuation [basically, assigning huge negative value to venture capital Vision Fund ]. It has stakes in BABA, ARM , S, SoftBank Corp , Vision Fund . Some holdings in venture capital Vision Fund have done poorly recently [SLACK, UBER, WeWork/WeCo (IPO was postponed)]. Vision Fund II may have trouble attracting investors. Some worry if CEO \u201cMasa\u201d Son has lost his golden touch.\n\nPg 28: Paris-based comanager Nicole Kornitzer [with Kansas-based cousin Bill K] of international BUFIX can go-anywhere. Fund holds about 80 stocks with strong fundamentals and exposure to some secular trends [automation, emerging middleclass, global brands, etc].\n\nPg 29: Fossil fuels may remain dominant source of energy in our lifetime. The IEA projects peak oil demand/production after 2040. Renewable energy is making good inroads in power generation [it now has overtaken coal], some in transportation and not much in heating \u2013 it all boils down to the costs of replacement technology. Many institutional investors are calling on corporations to align themselves with the Paris Agreement on climate. A DB study showed that companies with positive climate-change news have outperformed. There are several ETFs for low-carbon footprint [CRBN, LOWC, etc].\n\nPg 30: Climate change may affect many munis. There are risks of credit downgrades due to damaged assets and tax base; flooding in coastal areas; hurricane damage; storm surges; draught; high heat; wildfires; after-affects of natural disasters, etc. Some issuers now include climate risk factors in their offering documents. Sustainability ratings provider HIP assigns high risks to munis from TX, GA, MD, IL, NJ, NY, CA. Moody\u2019s now includes climate factors in its muni ratings.\n\nPg 32: Jim Mitchell [78], Mitchell Partners hedge fund. Fund specializes in illiquid [large bid-ask spreads] micro-caps with market-cap under $100 million; no SEC quarterly filings; thinly traded or in pink-sheets/OTC. Many are family owned or have number of shareholders under 500. Fund is open to qualified investors only. CEF RMT also operates in this micro-cap area.\n\nPg 34: Income. Dividend and dividend-growth from consumer-staples PG, KO, PEP, CL, KMB, K. These have yield > 2%, dividend-growth in each of the past 3 years, market-cap > $20 billion. Tobacco stocks were excluded, so were controversial stocks such as KHC.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nORCL Founder/CEO Larry Ellison ditches UBER, WeWork / WeCo business models. Losing money to gain market share is idiotic.\n\nAlibaba [BABA] Founder/CEO Jack Ma retired this week on the 20th anniversary of the company; this week was also the 5th anniversary of its IPO and it still holds the record for the largest IPO on NYSE. Investors are looking forward to the new management hosting its annual investor day next week.\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 9, Up & Down Wall Street: The Fed patched the problem in the m-mkts by injecting liquidity in the repo market.
