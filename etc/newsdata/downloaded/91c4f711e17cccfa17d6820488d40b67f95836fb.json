Katie Hill is resigning from Congress", "language": "en", "text": "But as swift as her rise came her fall. Hill is resigning after less than a year in Congress over allegations she had relationships with staffers. Such relationships violate new House rules passed in the #MeToo era, making her seat potentially more competitive for Republicans. Here\u2019s what happened, from the beginning.\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened: Hill has acknowledged having a consensual relationship with a campaign staffer but has denied having a relationship with a staffer in her D.C. office. She is resigning after her colleagues launched an ethics investigation into the claims, which were first seen on the conservative website RedState. It\u2019s not immediately clear when she will resign.\n\nAD\n\nWhy is she resigning if she is denying some of the accusations? Good question. She denies the more serious claim, that she had a relationship with a congressional staffer. (\u201cAbsolutely false,\u201d she said in a statement last week.) It\u2019s more serious because it would break new rules passed last year by the House after the #MeToo movement brought down nine members of Congress. As The Post\u2019s Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports, \u201cIt is against the official code of conduct for members to \u2018engage in a sexual relationship with any employee\u2019 who works for the member.\u201d\n\nHill has been somewhat vague about why she is leaving. \u201cI believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country\u201d to resign, she said in a statement Sunday. But she has also framed herself as a victim of revenge porn. Sexual photos of her with her campaign staffer were released online, and she has accused her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, of behind it. She said in her resignation statement that she is pursuing legal options.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s some irony \u2014 and controversy \u2014 to Hill being the first one to lose her seat to these rules: The rules changes were driven by Democrats (though they passed a Republican-led Congress with lots of Republican support and leadership). And they were primarily in response to men leveraging their power for sex. The decades-old rules changes came after these events, as I reported last year:\n\nLawmakers have been accused of everything from groping a soldier while on a USO tour (resigned Democratic Minnesota senator Al Franken) to writing love notes to a staffer (retiring GOP congressman Patrick Meehan) to offering to pay a staffer $5 million to bear his child (resigned GOP Arizona congressman Trent Franks) to decades of unwanted touching and sexual advances (resigned Michigan Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr.).\n\nTo supporters of Hill, or supporters of just having more female members in Congress, it seems unfair. Hill has not been accused of any wrongdoing \u2014 an ethics investigation was just getting started. And she was not accused of sexual harassment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor decades, male lawmakers got away with those sort of shenanigans,\u201d Los Angeles Times columnist Robin Abcarian wrote under the headline: \u201cKatie Hill messed up but she should not have resigned.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t you know it, the first one to fall afoul of the rule is a woman, and a bisexual woman, at that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s also a political irony: During the 2018 campaign, political analysts called Hill \u201cone of the most impressive Democratic contenders of 2018,\u201d and Democratic strategists routinely talked up Hill to reporters as one of their best recruits.\n\nHer first time running for office, she beat a Republican, Steve Knight, in her home district outside Los Angeles, and she quickly became an ally to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). She was installed in a powerful position on one of the committees now involved in impeachment proceedings against President Trump, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nAD\n\nNow, Pelosi has indicated it was right for her to resign \u2014 even before an ethics investigation in Congress concluded. Hill \u201ccame to Congress with a powerful commitment to her community and a bright vision for the future, and has made a great contribution as a leader of the Freshman Class,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cShe has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable. We must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear how competitive this seat becomes with Hill out: Before the allegations, the nonpartisan handicappers at Cook Political Report ranked her district as evenly split between Republican and Democratic voters, with a slight edge to Hill. The area has been trending Democratic and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Los Angeles Times reports it\u2019s unclear when a special election for her replacement will take place, largely because it is not clear when Hill will leave.\n\nDemocrats will be trying to hang onto the 40 seats they won last year, a number of them in districts that also voted for Trump in 2016.\n\nAD", "description": "She was a Democratic star \u2014 until she wasn't, over allegations she had an affair with a subordinate.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/y_BIX47B_LmLNwhPzdvrhwpm7wA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ASUG5XZBYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
