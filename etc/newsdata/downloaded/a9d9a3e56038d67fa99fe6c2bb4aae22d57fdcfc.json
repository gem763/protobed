I was so, so proud of the performance.\"\n\nVictory in Amsterdam puts Chelsea level with last season's Champions League semi-finalists on six points at the top of Group H and back on track to make the last 16 after a home defeat to Valencia on matchday one.\n\n\"It was very important after losing the first game against Valencia,\" said Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta.\n\n\"We showed a great ability to control the game after the first 15-20 minutes.\n\n\"We had a lot of chances to win the game, we were brave, we pressed high and very happy to get a late goal from Michy.\"\n\nBatshuayi has had to be patient for his chance to shine under Lampard with Tammy Abraham's fine form keeping the Belgian international on the sidelines.\n\nLampard introduced Batshuayi ahead of French international Olivier Giroud for the final 20 minutes and he had the desired effect by smashing in off the underside of the bar from Pulisic's cut-back.\n\n\"The other two (Giroud and Batshuayi) stay patient, work hard, support the group and have talent. He's waited for his moment and fully deserved it,\" added Lampard.", "description": "Chelsea manager Frank Lampard hailed his side's victory at Ajax in the Champions League as his best yet in charge of the Blues.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9114/0013ac45f92442e898180bbfb7c71534.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
