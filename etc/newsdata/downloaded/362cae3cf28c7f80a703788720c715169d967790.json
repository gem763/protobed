Best Buy has a new deal for a 40-inch Sharp TV, and it's well worth considering if you want a decent TV with smart technology for under $150. And no, that price isn't a typo. While the TV is normally $250, Best Buy has discounted it to an impressive $149.99.\n\nThere are plenty of things to like about this TV deal. For starters, the TV comes with the Roku operating system, so it's easy to install your favorite smart streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. Roku also integrates with the likes of Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, so you can control your TV with your voice.\n\nThe TV has plenty of connectivity for other devices, like gaming consoles, too. There are three HDMI ports, so even if you have a PS4, Xbox, and a Nintendo Switch, you should be able to plug them all in at once. There's also a USB port for powering other smaller devices, which is a nice touch.\n\nA 40-inch TV isn't massive, but it should be more than enough for most small- and medium-sized rooms. It's a great option for the spare room or bedroom, too, in case you'd rather hold off to get something larger for the living room.", "description": "For a limited time, you can get a 40-inch TV from Sharp and save $100 on the original price from Best Buy.", "authors": ["Christian De Looper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7008032e22af37f50d15a7?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
