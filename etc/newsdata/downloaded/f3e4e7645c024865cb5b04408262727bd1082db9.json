The technology is practical,\" says Brian von Herzen, an environmentalist and executive director of the Climate Foundation, a non-profit organisation tackling food security.\n\nHowever, he is not certain that the NetTag will be attractive to the operators of big fishing boats, who might not want to waste time retrieving lost nets.\n\nMr von Herzen says that even if the new transponder allows fish boats to locate lost nets, they still might spend half a day recovering the equipment. That time could be more valuable than the price of the net.\n\nMr Athinaios finds NetTag environmentally very promising, but is also sceptical whether it will modify his fellow professionals' behaviour.\n\nSince 2009 a European Community Council Regulation has required fishing boats to recover any lost fishing gear as soon as possible - carrying equipment on board for this purpose - or else potentially face harsh fines, and ultimately confiscation of the vessel or fishing gear.\n\n\"Yet, nothing has changed,\" says Mr Athinaios.\n\n\"The law is not enforced. Most of us have equipment like GPS and plotters. Big boats have advanced equipment and crews of divers to track lost gear down, but they don't do it because they can make \u20ac6,000, the cost say, of a lost net on any given day.\"\n\nImage copyright Jeff Neasham Image caption Jeff Neasham is convinced the transponders can save fishermen time and money\n\nDr Neasham says that if fishermen have the precise coordinates to retrieve a net via GPS, then they are not really searching for a ghost net.\n\n\"We are talking about situations where gear has been moved by storms, broken away from moorings, or caught by other vessels and cut loose,\" Dr Neasham says.\n\n\"The skipper of our research boat has been involved in many attempts to retrieve lost gear and, even when they are confident they know where a ghost net is, the net can prove to be several hundred metres off where they finally manage to hook it.\"\n\nHe is convinced that NetTag will save lots of time and money.\n\nMr von Herzen thinks the solution is to reward fishermen for retrieving ghost nets.\n\nIn regions like Europe where the fisherman's catch is capped, he suggests that for each net recovered that cap could be raised.\n\n\"In this case, these low-cost transponders would come in handy,\" Mr von Herzen says.\n\nImage copyright Giannis Athinaios Image caption Transponders might encourage fisherman to recover nets\n\n\"We should propose these revised regulations, and have a period of public comment, in which we would have town meetings and discussions - instead of lectures - with the fishermen,\" he adds.\n\nHe thinks it could also change the culture of fishing. \"They would view themselves as stewards of the ocean,\" suggests Mr von Herzen.\n\nOver the next months, the NetTag project will conduct full field trials with fishermen in Portugal and Spain, who will be the first to try out the technology before it hits the markets.\n\nDr Neasham is confident the endeavour will do away with the \"epidemic\" of ghost nets.\n\n\"We should be expecting 90% of lost fishing gear to be recovered in the developed world over the next 10 years if the project becomes mainstream.\"", "description": "Ghost nets kill huge numbers of marine animals every year, but new tech might help prevent that.", "authors": ["Stav Dimitropoulos", "Technology Of Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4BF2/production/_108924491_jannis.back.boat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
