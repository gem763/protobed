Many of them were calling for a second referendum -- something that those opposed to Brexit have been calling for since shortly after the first referendum in 2016, where 52 percent of voters chose to leave.\n\nWhile polls show Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party leading comfortably in the polls, there is a strong alliance of anti-Brexit parties in Parliament, and polls suggest that the public is still mostly split down the middle on Britain\u2019s departure from the E.U.\n\nSupporters of the amendment that passed, put forward by independent (and former Tory) MP Oliver Letwin, say it will remove the risk that the U.K. could still fall out of the bloc by mistake if there was a problem getting through Parliament the formal legislation needed to implement the deal.\n\nBut it requires Johnson, who has repeatedly promised that Britain would leave the E.U. on Oct. 31., to request a delay to the departure date. European leaders have said that there would be no further delays now that there is a deal on the table.\n\n\"I want us to finish this off and speak about the future,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday. \"The Oct. 31 date must be respected. I don't believe new delays should be granted.\"\n\nIf the Letwin amendment was to pass, the Times of London reported that Downing Street would abandon the vote and sent MPs home.\n\nBORIS JOHNSON AIDE DENIES PRIME MINISTER COFFEE IN DISPOSABLE CUP\n\nShould the amendment be foiled, Johnson still faces the daunting task of getting his deal over the line by itself. His party holds only 288 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, so will require support from pro-Brexit MPs in other parties -- while limiting defections within his own.\n\nIt was a task that evaded former Prime Minister Theresa May, who failed to get her own deal through on three separate occasions before she resigned in the summer.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal differs from the May\u2019s deal on the crucial aspect that it abandons the controversial backstop proposal that would have seen the U.K. kept in a customs union until a formal trade deal was made. The backstop was made to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the U.K.) and Ireland -- which is remaining within the E.U.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut in Johnson\u2019s deal a special status is created for Northern Ireland which allows it to keep an open border with Ireland but while keeping unity with the rest of the U.K.", "description": "A crucial vote on U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was facing a last-ditch bid by anti-Brexit MPs to derail it hours before lawmakers were due to cast their votes -- as thousands protested outside Parliament.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/18/694940094001_6095977216001_6095972035001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
