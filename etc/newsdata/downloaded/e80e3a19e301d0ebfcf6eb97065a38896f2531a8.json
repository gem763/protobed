Matt Gaetz (center) was ridiculed on social media after appearing to believe the term 'kangaroo court' was somehow linked to the children's TV show Captain Kangaroo\n\nHe claimed that Adam Schiff, who is leadings the hearings around the impeachment inquiry, is a 'malicious Captain Kangaroo'\n\nA former Daily Beast reporter wrote that Gaetz is an 'incredible idiot'\n\nA Time opinion writer said Gaetz should be disbarred for thinking this\n\nA former CIA officer reference another character from the kids' TV show, claiming Mr. Green Jeans is even more 'malicious' than Captain Kangaroo\n\nA Washington Post reporter patronized Gaetz, claiming that it was actually Marshall of the Kangaroo Court who presides over a 'kangaroo court' and not Captain Kangaroo\n\nDID CAPTAIN KANGAROO START KANGAROO COURTS? Sorry, Matt Gaetz - he didn't. He did tell children to wear their seat belts, and like a judge, respect the law, but he oversaw no criminal justice process, however badly-conducted. In fact nobody is entirely sure of the origin of the term, which the Merriam-Website Dictionary defines as 'a court characterized by irresponsible, unauthorized, or irregular status or procedures.' But it does pre-date Captain Kangaroo, who first hit TV screens in 1955, by easily 100 years. The Merriam-Webster has found its earliest use in the Times-Picayune of New Orleans in 1841, which reported 'several loafers were lunched... upon various charges instituted by the Kangaroo court.' One theory holds that it was popularized in the 1849 Gold Rush, when thousands of Australians arrived in California. Justice in the lawless gold fields was unpredictable - jumping like a kangaroo. Another theory is simply that the courts were classified by their rapid and unpredictable movement from one place to another - hopping like kangaroos. Either way both literal kangaroos and Captain Kangaroo never sat in judgment on kangaroo courts. And if Mr. Gaetz is wondering, Captain Kangaroo was named for his deep pockets - like a female marsupial's pouch.\n\n'This incredible idiot thinks that the term 'kangaroo court' comes from the TV show Captain Kangaroo,' former Daily Beast reporter Timothy Burke posted to Twitter, along with a video of Gaetz's comments.\n\nWashington Post reporter Dave Weigel patronized Gaetz, writing on Twitter: 'Gaetz is incorrect: It is the Marshall of the Kangaroo Court, not the Captain, who presides over trials.'\n\n'If Gaetz thinks Captain Kangaroo is malicious, wait until he meets Mr. Green Jeans,' a former CIA officer \u2013 and current podcast host \u2013 wrote, referencing character Mr. Green Jeans, played by Hugh 'Lumpy' Brannum.\n\nAn opinion writer for Time said that Gaetz's ability to practice law should be stripped since he doesn't know the difference between the children's TV show and the vernacular used to describe a haywire courtroom.\n\n'Does Congressman Gaetz think the phrase 'kangaroo court' came from Captain Kangaroo? That alone should qualify for disbarment,' Christopher Hale tweeted.\n\nGaetz, 37, was invoking rhetoric used by Trump earlier in the day, when the president said he wasn't going to allow U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testify before Democratc-led committees he claimed were conducting unfair practices.\n\n'I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,' Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\n\nThe president is referencing the Intelligence Committee's questioning of former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker last week.\n\nGaetz was invoking Donald Trump's rhetoric \u2013 when the president referred to the Democratic inquiry as a kangaroo court\n\nCaptain Kangaroo (left) was a children's show that ran on CBS from 1955-1984. Here Captain Kangaroo, played by Bob Keeshan, can be seen with supporting character Mr. Green Jeans (left), played by Hugh Brannum\n\nVolker, who resigned after Congress called him to testify, gave a deposition to panel members in a closed-door session, which at times was chaired by President Trump's nemesis, California Representative Adam Schiff.\n\nRepublicans protested ahead of the hearing that they were not being given the same amount of time as Democrats were to question Volker.\n\n'We would sure like to see the Volker testimony released before we continue the depositions and transcribed interviews,' Gaetz said, joined alongside by fellow Republican Reps. Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Lee Zeldin and Scott Perry.\n\n'We would like to unpack the last set of Schiff lies regarding the Volker testimony before we go to the next set of Schiff lies on Sondland or any further witnesses,' the Trump-ally continued.\n\nVolker's testimony, and the committee's desire to question Soundland, come after a whislte-blower revealed Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nRevelations of the July 25 phone call led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce the lower chamber was launching an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nTrump maintains that his talk with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was 'perfect' and says it is his duty to weed out corruption \u2013 which he says the Bidens were involved with in Ukraine.\n\nSoundland was scheduled to voluntarily appear for a deposition at the House of Representatives Tuesday morning, but was instructed by the State Department not to show up.\n\nAs a State Department employee, Soundland had to comply with the instructions, his attorney said.\n\nNow House Democrats will subpoena Ambassador Sondland to testify in their impeachment inquiry.\n\n'We consider this interference to be obstruction of the impeachment inquiry. We will be issuing a subpoena to Ambassador Sondland for both his testimony and documents,' Schiff, as well as Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engle, said in a joint statement Tuesday afternoon.", "description": "A Republican representative was lambasted on social media Tuesday for appearing to confuse Donald Trump's reference to a 'kangaroo court' to the decades-old show Captain Kangaroo.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19461422-0-image-a-17_1570567838977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
