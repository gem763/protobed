Like Serena, she was reading\u2014reportedly a nonfiction book about CIA agents who\u2019ve been killed in service. In photos obtained by the New York Post, she\u2019s wearing a pale-blue sweatshirt and a couple of oversize rings, just your average disgraced heiress chowing down a Double-Double and a shake. Her reading glasses sit on the table, and her chin rests on her elbow in a way that makes me wonder whether she might have actually posed for the photo.\n\nRead: The myth of the \u2018underage woman\u2019\n\nSerena Waterford, coffee drinker, reader, former mistress of a house in which a woman was ritually raped once a month. Ghislaine Maxwell, burger connoisseur, reader, the woman accused by several others of facilitating their assaults. Women are, of course, no more innately ethical or benevolent than men are, and yet there\u2019s something grimly perplexing about women who seem to help men subjugate other women. In Hulu\u2019s expanded version of the universe detailed in Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 novel, Serena Waterford isn\u2019t just a former televangelist whose career is stunted by Gilead\u2019s brutal, patriarchal theocracy. As played by Strahovski and envisioned by The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019s creator, Bruce Miller, she\u2019s one of the intellectual forces that helped conceive it, shown in flashback to have been a conservative speaker and the author of a book titled A Woman\u2019s Place. Serena is among the first pre-Gileadians to frame fertility as a \u201cnational resource\u201d and reproduction as a \u201cmoral imperative.\u201d What she fails to foresee is that a society fashioned around male supremacy won\u2019t always make special exceptions for her.\n\nTo watch The Handmaid\u2019s Tale this week, or Showtime\u2019s The Loudest Voice\u2014in which Russell Crowe\u2019s Roger Ailes was seemingly enabled in his alleged sexual harassment and abuse by his assistant Judy Laterza (Aleksa Palladino)\u2014was to see echoes of a recurring theme that keeps playing out in the news cycle. Harvey Weinstein was reportedly able to compel actresses to attend meetings in his hotel room because he had female assistants take them upstairs. Laterza, according to accounts by the journalist Gabriel Sherman, approached pretty young interns and invited them to meet her boss. Maxwell allegedly functioned as a madam for Epstein, finding him a steady flow of girls. No system of female oppression can function, it seems, without women being complicit in it.\n\nThe 2016 election, in which 53 percent of white women opted to vote for a man who has bragged about assaulting women, showed that many women will prioritize their assumed economic security over the well-being of others. On the simplest level, money and power can act as powerful motivators. Before Maxwell met Epstein, she\u2019d suffered a decline in her own fortunes when her father, the media tycoon Robert Maxwell, drowned in 1991 after falling from his yacht, Lady Ghislaine, off the coast of the Canary Islands. After his death, it emerged that Maxwell had plundered hundreds of millions of pounds from his company\u2019s pension funds. His daughter was left with nothing but a personal trust granting her \u00a380,000 a year. She fled to New York, leaving 32,000 of her father\u2019s employees to deal with the emptying out he\u2019d done of their retirement accounts.", "description": "Recent television shows and news stories raise a similar question: Can systems of oppression function without the involvement of women?", "authors": ["Sophie Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/WomenWhoEnableMenRevise/facebook.jpg?1565988243", "published_at": "2019-08-17"}
