The cases will test whether the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bans job discrimination on the basis of sex, applies to gay and transgender workers. The answer will be particularly important in 28 states that do not have their own protections. The cases pick up from the same-sex marriage battle in 2015, when the court ruled 5-4 that states cannot ban gays and lesbians from getting married.But the author of that decision and others favoring gay rights, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, retired last year and was succeeded by Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nPrefer to listen?
