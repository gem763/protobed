Supreme Court Justice Neena Sharma agreed with the college that using the term death midwife did violate the act, she also agreed with MaryMoon that ordering her to stop infringed on her freedom of expression.\n\nSharma dismissed the college's request to order an injunction stopping her from using the term.\n\nShe also ruled that section of the Health Professions Act infringes on freedom of expression and that it is no longer valid.\n\nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons was an intervener in the case over the use of the term, and Sharma noted in her decision published Wednesday that under the same law the college could prosecute self-described lawn doctors or tree surgeons.\n\n\"The fact that it chooses not to because of the unlikelihood they would be perceived as health professionals is relevant to this analysis. Notably, that approach contrasts with the college's indication that it would prosecute someone proclaiming themselves to be a 'divorce midwife,'\" Sharma said.\n\n\"I hope this creates a precedent for other people across the country who really want to do the pan-death [before, during and after death] support of family, and refer to themselves as midwives,\" said MaryMoon.", "description": "A Victoria, B.C., woman who describes herself as a \"death midwife\" has successfully fought a legal challenge by the College of Midwives of B.C. to use the term in her work.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308190.1570138581!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/pashta-marymoon-wins-right-to-use-term-death-midwife.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
