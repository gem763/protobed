It has survived despite the fact that the D.N.C. put one of its hacked servers on display \u2014 not in Ukraine but in its Washington offices beside the filing cabinet pried open in 1972 by the Watergate burglars (and a photo of the two artifacts ran on The Times\u2019s front page). It has survived despite the indictment prepared last year by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, laying out in extraordinary detail the actions of 12 named Russian military intelligence officers who hacked the D.N.C. and other election targets.\n\nThe speculation springs from what Mr. Trump has called a \u201cbig Dem scam\u201d \u2014 the false notion that the F.B.I. never really investigated the D.N.C. hack. In fact, according to people directly involved, CrowdStrike was in regular contact with the bureau in spring 2016 as it examined dozens of servers used by both the D.N.C. and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nIt is true, as Mr. Trump has often tweeted, that F.B.I. agents never took physical possession of the Democrats\u2019 servers. But CrowdStrike supplied the F.B.I. with digital copies of the servers so that the bureau could assess the Russian malware infecting them. The Mueller investigation later confirmed CrowdStrike\u2019s findings.\n\nStill, the president has clung to the theory linking CrowdStrike, Ukraine and the D.N.C. servers despite the repeated efforts of his aides to dissuade him, Thomas Bossert, his former homeland security adviser, said on Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThe D.N.C. server and that conspiracy theory has got to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nTo go in search of the roots of Mr. Trump\u2019s CrowdStrike-Ukraine conspiracy theory is to travel the internet\u2019s most peculiar provinces and the darkest threads on Twitter and Facebook. On 4chan and pro-Trump spaces on Reddit, on websites like ZeroHedge.com and Washington\u2019s Blog, you can find plenty of speculation about evil manipulation by CrowdStrike and secret maneuvers by Ukrainians \u2014 often inflamed by Mr. Trump\u2019s own statements.", "description": "A false, convoluted tale about Ukraine and a Democratic conspiracy to undermine the 2016 election has formed the background of President Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Scott Shane"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/multimedia/03conspiracy-01/03conspiracy-01-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
