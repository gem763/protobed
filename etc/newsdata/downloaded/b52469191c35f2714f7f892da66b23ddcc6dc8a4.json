We\u2019re going to have to be very physical.\n\n\u201cEvery time South Africa and England play against each other it\u2019s a physical onslaught and I don\u2019t think this will be any different.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: World Rugby via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mutual respect between the two countries and the best way we can show that is by going hard against each other.\u201d\n\nMtawarira\u2019s tone was repeated by half a dozen of his team-mates in the wake of Sunday\u2019s bruising semi-final victory over Wales.\n\nEven team boss Rassie Erasmus played down the likelihood of the Boks coming at England with an expansive approach, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not 100 per cent sure about that! I think we\u2019ll go and try and grind it out.\u201d\n\nBut Eddie Jones, who helped South Africa win the 2007 World Cup final AGAINST England, believes it could be a trap and has cautioned his side against falling into it.\n\n\u201cLook we know they are a massively aggressive physical forward pack,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBut Rassie is a good, cunning coach who has done a great job and we\u2019re prepared for the unexpected.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cYou saw Faf de Klerk do 15-20 box kicks against Wales but Handre Pollard is an excellent kicker so we know they can play differently.\n\n\u201cWe know that they are going to come through the front door, as there are not many Springbok teams that don\u2019t. So we\u2019ve got to be ready at the front door and have enough cover at the back door too.\u201d\n\nThis is the point of the tournament where Jones is really earning his money. The game\u2019s best paid international coach used his experience to dazzling effect to get England past Australia and New Zealand. One challenge remains.\n\nAt their Disneyland hotel the Australian insisted England could improve on their masterclass performance against the All Blacks, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve played as well as we can\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe then revealed that the secret of getting a team spot on for the final is to \u201cdo less, not more\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs you go through the tournament, the margins get smaller,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe improvements you can make are still significant but it\u2019s about focusing on what\u2019s going to have a significant part of the game.\n\n\u201cCoaches tend to think they\u2019ve got to do more so it\u2019s making sure we don\u2019t over-coach and let the players find their own rhythms. Because they\u2019ll be ready to go, you don\u2019t lack motivation for a World Cup final.\n\n\u201cThey know how they want to play and are aware of the challenges ahead. We just need to make sure they are physically fresh, mentally clear and have the game plan in their head.\u201d", "description": "Tendai Mtawarira, ominously nicknamed \u2018The Beast\u2019, has warned England must be ready to battle in the World Cup final", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "World Rugvia Getty Images", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20744255.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TOPSHOT-RUGBYU-WC-2019-MATCH46-WAL-RSA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
