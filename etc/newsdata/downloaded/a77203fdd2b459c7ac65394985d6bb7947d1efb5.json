Last year was my first year as a senior. There were many things I wasn\u2019t used to, such as the timetable and the new curriculum. Hopefully this year will be easier.\n\nTracy Chen Cheuk-tung, 16, Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Tong Secondary School\n\nTalking Points: what worries you the most about the upcoming school year?\n\nSurvivor\n\nThe usual.

Most students put a lot of pressure on themselves to do well in their exams, and that can take a real toll on their mental health. I think being optimistic is a good way to give ourselves the boost we need. A little encouragement goes a long way, and it doesn\u2019t have to come from other people. I will try to remember this and keep cheering myself on this year.\n\nDonna Izabel, 17, HKTA The Yuen Yuen Institute No. 3 Secondary School\n\nArabian dreams\n\nTo get into my dream university \u2013 New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
