No sign of anger, no flicker of excitement or worry. A numbness.\n\nThe right arm is extended toward him, lining up a target for the gun in hand.\n\n\u201cI see him every day,\u201d Jim Meyers said, calmly but emphatically. \u201cEvery day. I saw him when I was in the shower this morning. It is burned into my mind.\u201d\n\nThe 9mm semi-automatic handgun blasting away the morning of Sept. 6, 2018 , in Cincinnati\u2019s Fifth Third Center first hit one of Meyers\u2018 construction co-workers in the back, and then a second co-worker, who would die. The gunfire killed two more people and left a woman riddled with 12 bullets she somehow survived.\n\nGunman Omar Santa Perez, 29, whose motive for the attack remains unknown, died minutes later in a police barrage.\n\nThree killed isn\u2019t even close to the largest death tolls from the mass shootings that plague the United States. A total of 38 people died last month in three shootings. One in nearby Dayton killed nine people barely a month before the anniversary of the Cincinnati shootings.\n\nBut the tolls extend beyond death counts. The scars aren\u2019t just physical.\n\nKaren Rumsey, a social worker who heads Cincinnati Police Department victims\u2019 services, said the shootings in a downtown Dayton entertainment district some 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of those at Cincinnati\u2019s Fountain Square triggered calls from people she had counseled last year. Their memories of hearing gunfire, fleeing and hiding, and the losses of relatives, friends and colleagues were stirred up by a shooting in another public gathering place not far away.\n\n\u201cPeople are still struggling,\u201d Rumsey said. \u201cLives change forever because of the actions of one person.\u201d\n\nFor some, the struggles become too much. Suicides have followed mass shootings including those at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 and at Connecticut\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.\n\nFor family members of those slain, the pain endures over losing a loved one so abruptly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to go through; it\u2019s the type of thing that you don\u2019t ever think it\u2019s going to happen to you,\u201d said Larry Newcomer, voice choking as he recounted learning that his older brother, Rick Newcomer, 64, had been killed. \u201cThat\u2019s probably one of the regrets, because you always think you\u2019ll have more time.\u201d\n\nAlso killed were Prudhvi Raj Kandepi, 25, a Fifth Third consultant, and Luis Felipe Calderon, 48, a Fifth Third employee.\n\nBrian Sarver, 46, and Whitney Austin, 38, both shot at close range, often wonder why they escaped death that day.\n\nSarver, Meyers and Newcomer were meeting in the lobby to discuss a construction project. The first shot hit Sarver from behind and exited his body. Newcomer, mortally wounded, followed Sarver down a stairwell while a security guard helped Meyers to one on the other side of the lobby.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s in control,\u201d said Sarver, a father of three whose wife, Lisa, was with members of her Bible study group when he was shot. \u201cI don\u2019t understand everything He does. I can\u2019t explain why I lived when others didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAustin, a Fifth Third executive just arriving from her Louisville home for meetings, was concentrating on a conference call as she came through the revolving door. Shots knocked her down, facing the square outside.\n\nShe tried to move her left arm, but it was like \u201ca dummy arm.\u201d It caught the shooter\u2019s attention, and he came back to fire into her prone body. She played dead, and he moved on. She believed she would die, but then spotted a Cincinnati police officer and yelled at him to save her for her children .\n\nMeyers, in a stairwell after shots in his direction missed him, heard volleys of gunfire. He came up to see bodies, blood and shattered glass across the floor.\n\nAustin, all those bullets somehow having missed her internal organs and spine, was planning how to recover even before her surgeries began.\n\n\u201cIt was ridiculously lucky, a miracle,\u201d Austin said. \u201cAnd when something like that happens to you, what do you do with it? Give back, pay it forward. If I wasn\u2019t doing that, I was going to slip into feeling guilty, feeling unworthy.\u201d\n\nAustin soon founded Whitney/Strong, an organization dedicated to reducing gun violence, seeking common ground on the volatile issue of gun control. She gave up her Fifth Third job to focus full time on her new mission. To improve her understanding, she took gun safety training and forced herself to fire a gun.\n\nSarver, who underwent emergency surgery to have his ruptured spleen removed, had to work up emotionally to returning to the Fifth Third building. Late in December, on a Sunday afternoon, Fifth Third managers met him at the empty lobby. He was relieved he didn\u2019t go into a panic. He returned to work and now walks through the lobby regularly.\n\nNew shootings are upsetting.\n\n\u201cThe impact continues to reverberate on and on,\u201d Austin said. \u201cYou continue to be victimized after you\u2019ve already been victimized.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou realize that life is precious. Life is unpredictable,\u201d said Sarver, who shuts off his TV amid reports on shootings or other violence. \u201cI went to work that day and I came this close to not returning home.\u201d\n\nThese survivors have advice for others: Don\u2019t try to handle the aftermath alone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to get help,\u201d said Meyers, 64, who resumed working right after the shooting but remains in therapy. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to let your emotions show. Surround yourselves with support, lean on other people when you need it.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to get back to some normalcy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Angie Wang contributed from Cincinnati.
