It's obviously nice to contribute to a top team like this - and I feel that's the first of big moments me for this season,\u201d he said.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Just because I've not started any of the first nine games, I don't think that means I am not going to play a big part in this team.\n\n\u201cCan this be my season? Of course, yeah. It's a long old season. We've got the World Club Cup to come. The Champions League this week, the Premier League at the weekend, the Carabao Cup next week.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s important to stay strong and be ready. That\u2019s where my focus will be and I\u2019m delighted I can make an impact when I get the chance.\u201d\n\nLallana has unfairly been dismissed as \u2018injury prone\u2019 in recent years, but in fact, he has been fit and healthy for the best part of 18 months.\n\nHe has struggled to find rhythm though, after struggling for game time in a midfield where even skipper Jordan Henderson is always an automatic starter.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe England player has started just one game this season, in the EFL Cup, and made just five Premier League starts during the previous TWO campaigns.\n\nHe believes he is back to peak fitness though, and in the right shape to still be an important member of the squad, especially given the demands on players at the top level, which mean inevitable injuries:\n\n\"Football's a funny game. The last couple of years, we've got to the Champions League final with a maximum of just four really fit centre midfielders.\n\n\u201cSo it's about just staying fit, staying strong and staying ready. I feel that's where my focus will be.\n\n\"Listen, obviously I feel like I've been fit for a good year now, especially since coming back from pre-season. But we're European champions, we've got a top squad, so I've had to be patient for my chance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done that, and I am delighted to come on and make an impact like that. We are a top team, so to be able to contribute to it is important.\u201d\n\nMemories are short, and fans seem to have already forgotten just how important Lallana was in Klopp\u2019s thinking during his early years at Liverpool.\n\nThe manager said he set the tone for the pressing game, with an intelligence of movement and understanding of the system that the others followed.\n\nHe\u2019s been ignored by the supporters, in part, because his goal at Old Trafford was the midfielder\u2019s first for the Reds since May 21 2017, though he admitted he\u2019s found the net a few times since against slightly lesser opposition.\n\n\"I've scored plenty in the back garden against my lad since then - didn't feel half as good, though!\" he explained.\n\n\u201cI know my boy at home would have been watching and been delighted when that went in, so it\u2019s a big moment.\u201d", "description": "The Reds midfielder insists this can yet be his season after finding the net at Old Trafford on Sunday", "authors": ["David Maddock", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20664513.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
