Critics say the pullout green-lights a Turkish military assault on the Kurds, who Turkey views as terrorists, raising fears of potential ethnic cleansing.\n\nIt also raises serious concerns about the security of an estimated 80,000 ISIS prisoners currently held in Kurdish prisons. U.S. officials have previously warned the prisoners \u2014 about 12,000 fighters and their families \u2014 could form the basis of the next \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nThe move was met with outrage and disbelief from critics including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a fervent Trump ally, who tweeted that the withdrawal was a \u201cdisaster in the making.\u201d\n\nHe said the move would ensure an ISIS comeback and represented a \u201cstain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawal started just hours after a statement from White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham late Sunday announcing Ankara would \u201csoon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States armed forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d said the statement.\n\nREAD: How Trump\u2019s sudden withdrawal from Syria is bringing the Kurds and Assad together\n\nOn Monday morning, Trump addressed the withdrawal in a series of tweets which, like the White House statement, pointedly blamed European nations for not having repatriated and prosecuted their nationals who are being held by the Kurds for alleged ISIS crimes, despite repeated requests from the U.S. and the Kurds.\n\n\u201cEurope did not want them back, they said you keep them USA! I said \u201cNO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted, adding that Europe had been taking the U.S. for \u201csuckers.\u201d\n\nHis sole acknowledgment of the plight of the Kurds, who lost an estimated 11,000 lives in the U.S.-backed fight against ISIS, was that they \u201cfought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood.\u2019\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump threatens to \u201cdevastate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if they attack U.S.-trained Kurds in Syria\n\nThe move represents a sudden policy swerve for the U.S., which had previously been attempting to reach a deal with both parties to prevent Turkey from invading Syria. Ankara views the Kurds as terrorists, indistinguishable from Kurdish separatists it is battling on its own soil.\n\nThe sudden pullout shocked the Kurdish authorities in Syria, who have relied on support from the United States for protection against many enemies in the region. In a series of tweets, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces described how it had been removing fortifications and heavy weapons from along the border area in line with the U.S.-guaranteed agreement with Turkey.\n\n\u201cErdogan's threats are aimed to change the security mechanism into a mechanism of death, displace our people & change the stable & secure region into a zone of conflict and permanent war,\u201d it wrote on Twitter.\n\nBrett McGurk, who was the U.S.\u2019s Special Presidential Envoy to the global coalition against ISIS from 2015 until last year, was also scathing of the move, which he said \u201cserved up\u201d Kurdish forces to Turkey.\n\nREAD: These two guys from Brooklyn went to war in Syria to fight ISIS. Now, they\u2019re back.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation,\u201d he tweeted. He warned Turkey\u2019s plans for northern Syria would essentially extend its borders up to nearly 20 miles deep into Syria, making minorities such as Kurds and Christians vulnerable. He also said Turkey has \u201cneither the intent, desire, nor capacity\u201d to deal with the prisoners.\n\nLina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa program at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank, said it was difficult to envisage how the successful handover of ISIS prisoners from Kurdish to Turkish custody could take place, given the two parties were enemies. \u201cAll this does not bode well for Turkey\u2019s prospects of managing the ISIS prisoners situation effectively,\u201d she said.\n\nMacer Gifford, an anti-ISIS campaigner who fought for Kurdish forces against the Sunni terror group, said the withdrawal had raised fears of ethnic cleansing for Kurds and other minorities like Syriac Christians from the region, especially given that Turkey was likely to make heavy use of its proxy forces, which contained many Islamist extremists.\n\nGifford called the move a gift to ISIS, which \u201cthrives on chaos\u201d and would be expected to try to liberate its supporters from Kurdish prisons and regroup. \u201cISIS has been waiting for this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a nightmare.\u201d\n\nCover: In this Oct. 4, 2019, file photo, President Donald Trump talks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House, in Washington.
