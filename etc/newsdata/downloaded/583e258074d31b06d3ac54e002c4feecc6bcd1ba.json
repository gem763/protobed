The force from its powerful bite caused McDaniel's kayak to spin 180 degrees\n\nChambers was in his own kayak about 25 feet away as the scene played out.\n\nHe yelled at McDaniel, telling him to hit the shark on head to drive it away.\n\nMoments later the shark sank its teeth into McDaniel's kayak, leaving two of them behind before swimming away.\n\nThe force from the bite lodged the shark's teeth into the craft's plastic and caused it to spin 180 degrees, which McDaniel theorizes dislodged the jagged incisors.\n\nThe teeth were roughly two inches long, which means the shark they belonged to was about 19 feet long.\n\nAbout a dozen great white shark encounters have been reported so far this year around the island, which sits about 50 miles of the coast of southern California\n\nThe diver's fitness tracker, which monitors his heart rate, allowed him to mark the precise moment of the harrowing encounter.\n\n'My heart jumped at 4:30 exactly, about 150 yards west from Ship Rock,' he said.\n\nThe teeth were roughly two inches long, which means the shark they belonged to was about 19 feet long.\n\nSharks have multiple rows of teeth in their mouths, which are pushed forward to replace incisors pulled out after a major bite.\n\nMcDaniel took photos of the teeth he obtained, using his hand and a dollar bill to give viewers on his Facebook page a better idea of their size.\n\nMcDaniel took photos of the teeth he obtained, using his hand and a dollar bill to give viewers on his Facebook page a better idea of their size\n\nMarine biology professor Chris Lowe, who serves as director of the Shark Lab at Cal State Long Beach, said the shark that attacked McDaniel has been seen several times near Catalina Island over the last two weeks.\n\nAbout a dozen great white shark encounters have been reported so far this year around the island, which sits about 50 miles of the coast of southern California.\n\n'We should always be thinking there may be sharks here \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we should be scared,' Lowe told the L.A. Times. 'This is the new normal. We have to share the ocean with them.'", "description": "An estimated 19 foot great white shark bit into\u00a0San Diego resident Danny McDaniel's kayak near Catalina Island roughly 50 miles off the coast of southern California on Saturday,", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/04/19473768-0-image-a-12_1570592591004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
