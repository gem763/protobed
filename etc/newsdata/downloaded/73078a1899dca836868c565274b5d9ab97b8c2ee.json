REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nTrump\u2019s path to re-election in November 2020 depends on clinching a cluster of farm and Rust Belt states decided by slim margins in 2016. Minnesota, which Trump lost by 1.5 percentage points to Democrat Hillary Clinton, is a key target, his campaign said.\n\nHe faces tough odds. No Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972. Trump\u2019s unfavorability number in Minnesota is 11 points higher than his favorability rating, according to Morning Consult polling.\n\nBut Trump has said it was a mistake not to spend more time and money in the Midwestern state in 2016, and his campaign vowed the mistake would not be repeated.\n\n\u201cThis is a campaign on offense. This is a campaign going into states other campaigns couldn\u2019t put in play,\u201d Bill Stepien, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said in a phone interview.\n\nTrump will again use his rally to fire up his base, which has remained firmly behind him in opinion polls after Democrats last month launched an impeachment investigation into the president.\n\nThe House of Representatives probe centers on a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that Trump used U.S. military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing. The White House said on Tuesday it would refuse to participate in the \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional\u201d impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe rally is taking place in Minneapolis in the congressional district of Representative Ilhan Omar, a progressive Democrat who is one of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics.\n\nThe Somalia-born congresswoman was one of four female lawmakers who Trump said this summer should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from if they did not like his policies. At a rally in North Carolina soon afterward, Trump supporters chanted: \u201cSend her back\u201d when he again blasted Omar.\n\nAhead of Trump\u2019s visit to her state this week, Omar and other Democratic officials said the president\u2019s rhetoric was not in line with their local values.\n\n\u201cMinnesota stands for peace, equity, and justice - everything you are against,\u201d Omar tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nRUNNING UP THE RURAL VOTE\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign disagrees.\n\nLike Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016, Minnesota has a large rural population that can erase Democratic gains in urban centers.\n\nThe campaign points to the state\u2019s 8th Congressional District, home to Minnesota\u2019s mining industry and once a reliable Democratic stronghold, as a sign that Trump\u2019s message resonates with voters there.\n\nTrump won the district by 15 percentage points in 2016, after Democratic President Barack Obama won it four years earlier by about 5 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the epicenter of Minnesota\u2019s changing political culture,\u201d Stepien said. \u201cThat\u2019s a district that sees what\u2019s happening in D.C., with Democrats lurching further and further to the left. It\u2019s a district that wants jobs, wants mining, wants less regulation, all the things that Trump talked about in 2016.\u201d\n\nTrump lost the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul by greater margins than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. But he won the rest of the state by bigger numbers than Romney.\n\nRepublican strategists in the state said the suburban counties around Minneapolis would decide the election. Polls show Trump struggling nationally with suburban voters.\n\n\u201cI understand why the campaign needs to show it\u2019s expanding the map, but I think winning Minnesota is going to be a real challenge,\u201d said one Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nKen Martin, chair of Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Party, said the Trump campaign had built the biggest political operation he had ever seen for any Republican this early in the election cycle, but that it would not translate to victory. He said Trump was unpopular in the fastest-growing parts of the state - the suburbs and exurbs.\n\n\u201cIf Trump think he\u2019s going to flip Minnesota just by dealing with folks in greater Minnesota, which is the rural parts of the state, he\u2019s obviously not a math wizard,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe needs to understand where the votes come from in the state, and where those votes come from, he\u2019s not very popular.\u201d\n\nThe planned rally has fanned local partisan flames.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, drew scrutiny for initially suggesting the president was not welcome in the city.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Frey said the president had targeted the most marginalized members of the city\u2019s community with his divisive language, which is amplified at his rallies.\n\n\u201cSo while our thriving city is open to everyone, I will continue to stand alongside people in Minneapolis and reject speech and behavior that make any of our residents less safe,\u201d Frey said.\n\nThe head of the Minneapolis police union, Bob Kroll, said many officers wanted to go to Thursday\u2019s rally wearing their uniforms to show support for the president but were banned from doing so by the police department.\n\nIn response, the police union has been selling \u201cCops for Trump\u201d T-shirts for officers to wear instead.", "description": "President Donald Trump will travel to Minnesota on Thursday for his first campaign rally since Democrats in Washington launched an impeachment inquiry against him, his latest event in one of the states he lost in 2016 but believes he can pick up next year.", "authors": ["Jarrett Renshaw", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438858711&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981BI", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
