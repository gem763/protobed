But those remedies will now be applied to the Harvard faculty, and the professors are in an uproar.\n\nMembers of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the heart of the 378-year-old university, voted overwhelmingly in November to oppose changes that would require them and thousands of other Harvard employees to pay more for health care. The university says the increases are in part a result of the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which many Harvard professors championed.\n\nThe faculty vote came too late to stop the cost increases from taking effect this month, and the anger on campus remains focused on questions that are agitating many workplaces: How should the burden of health costs be shared by employers and employees? If employees have to bear more of the cost, will they skimp on medically necessary care, curtail the use of less valuable services, or both?\n\n\u201cHarvard is a microcosm of what\u2019s happening in health care in the country,\u201d said David M. Cutler, a health economist at the university who was an adviser to President Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. But only up to a point: Professors at Harvard have until now generally avoided the higher expenses that other employers have been passing on to employees. That makes the outrage among the faculty remarkable, Mr. Cutler said, because \u201cHarvard was and remains a very generous employer.\u201d", "description": "While Harvard professors oppose changes that will raise their health care costs, the university says the increases are in part a result of the Affordable Care Act, which many Harvard experts championed.", "authors": ["Robert Pear"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/06/us/06HARVARD-1/06HARVARD-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2015-01-06"}
