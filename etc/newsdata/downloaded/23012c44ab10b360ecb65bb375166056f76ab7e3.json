Last year, Judge Cagney Musi recused himself from heading the tribunal.\n\nALSO READ: No explanation as to why Cape Judge President John Hlophe has 16 outstanding judgments\n\nAt the time, Judge Musi told the tribunal that his decision to recuse himself came after Judge Hlophe called him in May 2018 and made ex parte communications, including asking him to recuse himself.\n\nCity Press previously reported that should Judge Hlophe be found guilty, he would be at risk of becoming the first judge in democratic South Africa to be impeached.\n\nA new date for the commencement of the hearings will be announced in due course.", "description": "The case relates to complaints laid against Judge John Hlophe after he allegedly tried to influence Constitutional Court judges in a case involving former president Jacob Zuma.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7112/8d0fba6f1f3a4510bd25a4dcf9a88dfc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
