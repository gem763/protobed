Fed Again?\n\nWith no major economic indicators scheduled tomorrow, investors will likely be looking at the Fed once again.\n\nThere are two Federal Reserve members scheduled to speak on Friday.\n\nOn one hand, there may be little to glean so soon after a rate decision and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. On the other, you never know what comment, intentional or not, might move the market.\n\nAt 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT), New York Fed President will be speaking at on monetary policy at the Swiss National Bank\u2019s \u201cNew Normal Monetary Policy Frameworks\u201d conference in Zurich. But that event is closed to the press.\n\nAt 11:30 AM ET, Boston Fed President speaks at a credit markets conference at New York University.\n\n2. The Season of the Witch\n\nThe stock market will see a big dose of options and futures action tomorrow, with quadruple witching arriving.\n\nQuadruple witching is the simultaneous expiration of stock index options, stock index futures, stock options and single stock futures.\n\nThe expiration of these contracts leads to higher-than-usual trading volume. It can also lead to increased volatility, especially near the end of the trading session.\n\n3. Rig Count Coming\n\nThe oil market has been roiled by geopolitics all week and headlines out of the Middle East will likely continue to have an impact in Friday trading.\n\nBut traders will also have some solid U.S. data on which to trade.\n\nBaker Hughes will issues its for the week at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).\n\nThe rig count came in at 733 for the previous week, down five from the week before that and 15.4% from a year ago, according to Baker Hughes data.", "description": "Day Ahead - Top 3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8S161_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
