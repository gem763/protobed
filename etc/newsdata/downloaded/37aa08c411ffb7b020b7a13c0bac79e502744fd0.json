Biden has a choppy speaking style that could undermine his message at a time when he needs to attract more voters and donors. (Jordan Gale/The New York Times)\n\nWEST POINT, Iowa \u2014 Joe Biden was making an impassioned case for protecting immigrants in the country illegally one recent Sunday when he abruptly stopped himself.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s many more things, but \u2014\u201d he said before trailing off at a union forum.\n\nMinutes later, Biden interrupted himself again.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a, there\u2019s \u2014 my time up?\u201d he said, echoing a line he had used when he stumbled in the first presidential debate this year. \u201cI guess not. I guess it is.\u201d\n\nAnd as he spoke to reporters here last week about President Donald Trump\u2019s freezing of military aid to Ukraine, he briefly fumbled his words.\n\n\u201cPeople are being killed in western, in eastern Afghan \u2014 excuse me, in eastern, uh, Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nSix months into his presidential campaign, Biden is still delivering uneven performances on the debate stage and on the campaign trail in ways that can undermine his message. He takes circuitous routes to the ends of sentences, if he finishes them at all. He sometimes says the opposite of what he means (\u201cI would eliminate the capital gains tax \u2014 I would raise the capital gains tax\u201d he said in this month\u2019s debate). He has mixed up countries, cities and dates, embarked on off-message asides and sometimes he simply cuts himself off.\n\nThat choppy speaking style puts Biden at a disadvantage as his front-runner status erodes and he confronts growing pressure to expand his appeal with voters and donors. He faces intensifying competition for moderate support, a formidable liberal foe in Elizabeth Warren, attacks on his family by Trump and Republicans, and a troubling cash crunch.\n\nAt a time when he most needs to convey confidence and forcefulness, some Democrats say, he is instead getting in his own way.\n\n\u201cHe does not do well speaking where he isn\u2019t giving a speech,\u201d said Chris Henning, the Democratic chair in Greene County, Iowa, who caucused for Biden when he ran for president in 2008. \u201cHe\u2019s not good in debates and he comes across like he\u2019s stumbling around, trying to figure out what he\u2019s going to say.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s verbal miscues have long led to challenges. He was forced to withdraw from the 1988 presidential campaign after he presented biographical details from the life of the British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock as his own. His gaffe-prone tendencies made national headlines during his 2008 presidential bid when he referred to Barack Obama as \u201cthe first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean.\u201d\n\nBut Biden can now appear less crisp, and more hesitant, than in the past \u2014 and also in comparison to more polished rivals in the crowded Democratic primary. As the early leader in 2020 polls he has spent more time in the national spotlight, and he is competing in a fast-moving social media environment in which gaffes are magnified and candidates are rewarded for being quick on their feet.\n\nBiden, 76, still leads many national polls, and he enjoys significant goodwill from many Democratic voters. Some attendees at his events in Iowa last week said Biden, who overcame a childhood stutter, is a relatable raconteur whose decades of experience are comforting amid the chaos of the Trump era. He can be forceful in denouncing the president from the podium, and is at his best in individual conversations with voters.\n\nAnd of course, if Biden wins the nomination, he will face a president who is an undisciplined speaker in his own right \u2014 one who misstated the name of his own Cabinet secretary recently, tortures grammar and spelling in his tweets and, most significantly, routinely makes false claims about matters large and small.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s inconsistent performances illustrate why many Democrats remain skeptical of his candidacy: Whatever his strengths in polls \u2014 and the data is mixed, especially in the early-voting primary states \u2014 on the ground his performances are often plainly shaky.\n\nNowhere are the stakes higher for Biden than in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state where Biden will return for a four-day swing Wednesday. Warren has tied or moved ahead of Biden in some polls, and party officials on the ground say Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, appears capable of siphoning some of Biden\u2019s centrist support. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a moderate from neighboring Minnesota, also gained attention after the October debate. Last week, she qualified for the fifth debate, scheduled for next month.", "description": "WEST POINT, Iowa -- Joe Biden was making an impassioned case for protecting immigrants in the country illegally one recent Sunday when he abruptly stopped himself.\"There's many more things, but --\" he said before trailing off at a union forum.Minutes later, Biden interrupted himself again", "authors": ["Katie Glueck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bEs._N_bnnK_WBkvF8ITxw--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/42f9e1f0bc8f2d20a1507f50b868e344", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
