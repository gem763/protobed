The Fort Worth Police Department said over the weekend that Dean \u201cdrew his duty weapon and fired\u201d at a \u201cperceived threat.\u201d\n\nPolice Chief Ed Kraus said Monday that Dean faces possible criminal charges for the Saturday night slaying, and if he had not resigned, he would have been fired.\n\n\u201cI get it. We are trying to do better... anyone who had looked at that video saw it was wrong,\u201d Kraus told reporters, adding that while he intended to meet with Dean on Monday, the officer resigned before he got the chance.\n\nKraus also said the officer has not been cooperative with the department\u2019s investigation and has refused to answer questions. He said the Fort Worth Police Department submitted a preliminary case to the FBI on Monday, so federal investigators can decide whether Dean should face charges for any civil-rights violations.\n\nDean\u2019s resignation was announced shortly after Jefferson\u2019s family slammed local authorities for the \u201creckless act\u201d and called on the federal government to investigate the slaying.\n\n\u201cWe demand justice for Atatiana with an independent thorough process,\u201d Ashley Carr, Jefferson\u2019s older sister, said during a Monday morning press conference. Carr\u2019s 8-year-old son was playing video games in Jefferson\u2019s bedroom at the time of the shooting.\n\nFlanked by several of Jefferson\u2019s family members, civil-rights attorney Lee Merritt said the \u201cproblematic\u201d police department created an \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cdangerous situation\u201d when they escalated Jefferson\u2019s welfare check \u201cwith the equivalent of a SWAT\u201d team response. The lawyer said the family wants the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct individual investigations into their loved one\u2019s murder.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but she\u2019s inside of her home, trying to protect her home and my son that\u2019s inside. She\u2019s not a threat. She\u2019s a college graduate,\u201d Carr added. \u201cYou know, you want to see justice, but justice don\u2019t bring my sister back.\u201d\n\nThe department admitted over the weekend that the now-former officer, who joined the force last year, never identified himself as a cop before he opened fire.\n\nJefferson\u2019s family members called for him to be \u201cvigorously prosecuted\u201d and \u201cappropriately sentenced.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want this officer to be charged like the criminal he is,\u201d community activist Corey Hughes said Monday. One of the slain woman\u2019s brothers added, \u201cWhen you don\u2019t do it the way you\u2019ve been taught, you have to answer for that.\u201d\n\nJefferson\u2019s neighbor, 62-year-old James Smith, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram he decided to call the police department\u2019s non-emergency number to report that her door was open because he was worried about the child inside the house.\n\n\u201cI called my police department for a welfare check. No domestic violence, no arguing, nothing that they should have been concerned about as far as them coming with guns drawn to my neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Smith added to WFAA.\n\nMerritt said Saturday the pre-med graduate and her nephew heard a sound they believed to be a \u201cprowler creeping around the back window of the home.\u201d Jefferson\u2014who had been living in the house to care for her sick mother while working remotely for a pharmaceutical equipment business to save for medical school\u2014paused their Halo game to investigate the sound, he said.\n\n\u201c[The nephew] saw her when she fell and he has found a way to maintain more composure than the Fort Worth police department. He still offers his mother, family consolement,\u201d Merritt said on Monday, adding that the child has already begun counseling. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the emotional trauma, psychological trauma this will have for an 8 year old.\u201d\n\nThe shooting occurred less than two weeks after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was convicted of fatally shooting her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his apartment in 2018.\n\nOn Sunday night, hundreds gathered to protest in a demonstration that was reminiscent of those held after Jean\u2019s death. Protesters demanded justice for Jefferson and called for action against racial bias and excessive use of force by police. While holding candles, signs, and registering people to vote, the over 500 attendees also called for the officer\u2019s prosecution.\n\n\u201cWhy this man is not in handcuffs right now is a source of continued agitation for this family and this community,\u201d Merritt said Monday.\n\nIn Smith\u2019s call to the police released on Sunday, the 62-year-old tells dispatchers it is unusual for Jefferson\u2019s door to be open.\n\n\u201cThe front doors have been open since 10 p.m., and I haven\u2019t seen anyone leave the house,\u201d he told the non-emergency operator.\n\nBody-camera footage shows two officers walking alongside Jefferson\u2019s home with flashlights before going to the side of the house to open the backyard gate. According to Smith, the two officers parked around the corner from Jefferson\u2019s home\u2014making it impossible for her to have seen them approaching.\n\nPolice said the officer in the backyard \u201cobserved a person standing inside the residence near a window\u201d and started to shout commands.\n\n\u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d the officer is heard yelling with his gun drawn before firing a single shot through the window.\n\nThe officers immediately entered the home, police said, \u201cand began providing emergency medical care.\u201d Jefferson was pronounced dead on the scene.\n\nWhile authorities said a gun was found inside the home after Jefferson was fatally shot, it was not immediately clear whether she was holding the weapon. Merritt said Monday that Jefferson legally owned a gun.\n\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price on Monday slammed authorities\u2019 decision to mention the firearm\u2014calling the addition \u201cirrelevant\u201d because Jefferson was in her own home. Price added that \u201cabsolutely nothing can justify\u201d the Saturday slaying.\n\n\u201cAtatiana was a victim, she was taken from her family. Justice is critical here,\u201d Price said at the Monday press conference. \u201cOur community is mourning and hurting, everyone expects justice however you define justice.\u201d\n\nDuring a Sunday news conference, Fort Worth Police Lt. Brandon O\u2019Neil also admitted Dean never identified himself as a police officer.\n\n\u201cWhat the officer observed and why he did not announce \u2018police\u2019 will be addressed as the investigation continues,\u201d O\u2019Neil said.\n\nThe Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s Office previously confirmed to The Daily Beast they are looking into Saturday\u2019s incident but have declined to provide details due to the \u201congoing investigation.\u201d Fort Worth authorities said there will be an update on Dean\u2019s criminal investigation on Tuesday.\n\nMerritt added that while the police department reached out to the family immediately after the incident, the family is reluctant to speak with authorities they do not trust.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we got the call, it\u2019s been more inconceivable and more confusing,\u201d Jefferson\u2019s aunt, Venitta Body, said Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing done to take away that confusion.\u201d", "description": "Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus said Monday Aaron Dean may face criminal charges for the slaying.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_115/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571072886/atatiana__1_n9pvto", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
