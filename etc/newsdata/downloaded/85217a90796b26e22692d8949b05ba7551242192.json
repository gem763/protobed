Often cheaper from a bank than a car finance specialist. Hire purchase: The car's cost is gradually paid off by the buyer with interest. At the end they own the car. If they default the car is repossessed. Personal Contract Purchase (PCP): The buyer pays a set monthly amount over a period of time, based on the car's expected depreciation. At the end of the period they are likely to have a lump sum balloon payment, if they want to take ownership. Alternatively, they can hand the car back. If they default on payments the car will be seized.\n\nOf the options provided, a hire purchase loan at 12 per cent APR over five years with a deposit of \u00a34,000 would be cheapest, with a total payment of \u00a314,530 by the end of the term.\n\nHowever, just 10 per cent of UK adults correctly identified this option as the best value.\n\nMeanwhile, the option that 11 per cent of people thought would be the cheapest was actually the most expensive, a flat rate hire purchase loan at 12 per cent over four years and a deposit of \u00a31,000.\n\nIt was much more expensive as it is a flat rate loan, meaning people pay interest on the amount they borrowed at the beginning of the loan and not on the declining balance over time \u2013 making the interest rate in this example nearly 23 per cent.\n\nMany car finance providers or dealerships still use flat rate loans rather than APR to make loans appear cheaper than they are.\n\nCar finance deals are making people stressed\n\nFurther research from Zopa found that 48 per cent of respondents taking out used car finance at a dealership found the whole process stressful.\n\nIt carried out research amongst 1,000 car finance customers between 19 July and 25 July 2019.\n\nComplex finance deals, baffling jargon, stressful dealership experiences and difficulties with price comparisons were all found to be contributing factors to buyers stress.\n\nZopa said its survey showed that one in four car buyers have taken out a car finance loan option that they didn't think they could afford, whilst 68 per cent of UK adults said they accepted the first car finance deal offered to them at a dealership, without shopping around for a better deal.\n\nAnother 19 per cent of car buyers admitted they don't understand the language used in car finance deals and 16 per cent said they didn't understand the finance options explained to them.\n\nWhy knowing your car finance could save you \u00a311,000 Almost half of people taking out car finance at a dealership found the whole process stressful To work out how much people could save over the course of their lifetime by knowing their car finance, Zopa analysed Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders data. It found 7.9million used cars were sold in 2018, around three times the 2.36million new cars freshly registered. With more than three times more used cars being sold in a year, this implies that a car goes through an ownership cycle of about three-and-a-half years, before being bought by a new owner and has around four owners before it is scrapped at 14 years old. Over a lifetime of car ownership, from the age of 18 to 70, it estimated that a British adult would own 15 cars. With 26 per cent of used cars were bought on finance in 2018, this suggested that UK adults will buy at least four cars on finance in their lifetime. The research found a \u00a32,750 gap between the most affordable car finance deal and the most expensive, which works out at \u00a311,000 over the course of an entire lifetime.\n\nCosts are confusing customers\n\nThe amount need to be paid on car finance deals is one of the main confusions motorists are encountering.\n\nThe study found that 47 per cent of drivers who have recently bought a car are also unable to identify what type of car finance deal they actually signed up for.\n\nA further 26 per cent of consumers had accepted a higher APR on a car finance deal than they thought they could afford, with 50 per cent of those people using it to buy the car of their dreams.\n\nAnother 26 per cent of people had done so where they needed a car urgently.\n\nOne issue is that many dealerships still leave hard marks on a car buyer's credit file before they have received a personalised quote \u2013 impacting their credit score in a way that is likely to reduce the chance that they will get credit from other lenders.\n\nEven more worrying is that so few consumers are aware that the industry is doing this, with 69 per cent of people taking out car finance in the last five years having no idea whether they received a hard credit check when they first inquired about a car.\n\nThe watchdog's investigation\n\nThe latest data comes in the wake of Financial Conduct Authority's investigation into excessive motor finance costs.\n\nIt found that people using finance to buy a car may have been overcharged on their interest payments by \u00a31,000 or more because of the way lenders pay commissions to motor dealers, with the FCA set to further investigate how commission works in the industry.\n\nZopa says that while today over 90 per cent of secured car finance is arranged at dealerships, and with the FCA set to rule on how commission works in the industry, customers do have alternative options which can help them avoid much of the stress, confusion, and uncertainty that's common in the market today.\n\nFor instance, car buyers can arrange their secured finance online before choosing their car.", "description": "Choosing the make and model  may seem like the difficult decision in a car purchase, but Britons are just as confused by  finance options, a survey claims.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
