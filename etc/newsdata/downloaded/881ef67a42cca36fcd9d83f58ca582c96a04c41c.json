Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t done a single interview with us since he became prime minister.\u201d\n\nJohn Humphrys' highs and lows as he prepares to exit Today Read more\n\nHe added: \u201cIncreasingly, politicians are talking directly to the people via social media so they can choose the questions they answer without being challenged.\u201d\n\nHis remarks came after one of Johnson\u2019s advisers dismissed the Today programme as a \u201ctotal waste of time\u201d. No 10 has sought to bypass the conventional media in favour of handpicked questions on Facebook.\n\nHumphrys asked Blair whether interviews on Today still mattered. \u201cThe Today interview should matter,\u201d Blair said.\n\nHumphrys then asked: \u201cWhen somebody like Boris Johnson refuses to appear on this programme, either during the leadership campaign or at any time since he became prime minister, what do you make of that?\u201d\n\nBlair said: \u201cWhen I first began as a politician, your ambition was to get on the Today programme. It probably means that he is anxious about a sustained and forensic analysis of what he\u2019s trying to do.\u201d\n\nBBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) John Humphrys signs off from Today after 32 years of presenting the flagship programme #r4today https://t.co/j0bLX3rNC4 pic.twitter.com/kU8j3mCQAE\n\nBoth Blair and David Cameron paid tribute to Humphrys while acknowledging their irritation with his combative interviewing style.\n\nCameron said: \u201cThank you for 32 years of striking the fear into politicians like me every morning and asking us questions that we don\u2019t always want to answer. Calling us to account is an amazing record. [Walter] Bagehot talked about the dignified and the efficient parts of the constitution. He didn\u2019t tell us about the painful but necessary parts. I guess that\u2019s where you come in.\u201d\n\nBlair said: \u201cDespite all the tussles we\u2019ve had over the years, I respect the fact that you\u2019re good at your job, and you\u2019re on top of the facts. And the fact that I worry about doing an interview with you is a tribute to you, not a criticism. But sometimes interviewers can be too aggressive.\u201d\n\nMuch of Thursday\u2019s programme was devoted to Humphrys and his long career at the BBC.\n\nThe 'paradox' of John Humphrys: rottweiler, dinosaur or shy walker? Read more\n\nIt included archive clips, a Humphrys-themed puzzle, and much leaving banter with presenters and guests. Even the programme\u2019s religious slot, Thought for Today, which Humphrys once described as \u201cdeeply boring\u201d, was turned over to the veteran broadcaster with a send-off from the UK\u2019s former chief rabbi Lord Sacks. He described Humphrys as \u201cone of the best of our times\u201d and added: \u201cBritish breakfasts will never be the same.\u201d\n\nTimeline The Today programme Show Hide The first edition of Today is broadcast as two 20-minute programmes slotted around existing news and religious programming on the BBC's Home Service. Over the years the programme gradually develops into a more familiar format - a couple of hours long, with a co-presenting team. The BBC launches a new Radio 4 morning show Up To The Hour. Today is reduced to two 25 minute slots during the morning. It lasts just over a year before Today sees off the up-start and is restored to its former length. A Saturday edition is added to the show. A notoriously tense exchange takes place between presenter Brian Redhead and then Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. Lawson accuses Redhead on air of being \"a supporter of the Labour Party all your life, Brian\". Redhead responds with \u201cDo you think we should have a one-minute silence now in this interview, one for you to apologise for daring to suggest that you know how I vote, and secondly perhaps in memory of monetarism which you have now discarded.\u201d Redhead leaves the show due to ill-health, having been a regular part of the team since 1975, forming an enduring presenting partnership with John Timpson. James Naughtie joins the line-up of presenters. He continues on the show until 2015. Andrew Gilligan's claims on the show that the government \"sexed up\" a dossier about Iraq's weapons capability ultimately leads to the Hutton Inquiry, and the resignation of the BBC's chairman Gavyn Davies and director-general Greg Dyke. Pope Benedict XVI records a 'Christmas message especially for the UK', broadcast as Thought for the Day. Former London Evening Standard editor Sarah Sands is named as the replacement for Jamie Angus at the helm of the flagship news and current affairs programme. Prince Harry guest edits, including interviews with Barack Obama and his father, Prince Charles. John Humprhys hosts his final show after 32 years.\n\nThe programme also included a guest appearance out of retirement from Dame Edna Everage. The alter ego of Barry Humphries performed a risque poem in honour of Humphrys, which included these lines: \u201cThe Queen told me before you grow much older, her sword will descend upon the Humphrys shoulder. Her voice is quiet. It doesn\u2019t really carry. She might have said John but she probably meant Barry.\u201d\n\nThe BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, also came into the Today studio to be interviewed. He thanked Humphrys on \u201cbehalf of all of us: the people who have loved working with you, the people who have put up with you at times too\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn all the stuff you read in the papers about the \u2018rottweiler Humphrys\u2019, you are also someone who handles interviewees who have been through traumas \u2026 with amazing sensitivity.\u201d\n\nPoliticians from all sides paid tribute to Humphrys on Twitter.\n\nJohn McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) #r4today Thank you John Humphrys for your huge contribution to public service broadcasting in our country. Although at times I could have brained you for your interruptions, your forensic interviews held us all to account enhancing our political debate. Have a great retirement. https://t.co/XCG0VjAv9k\n\nAnna Soubry MP (@Anna_Soubry) #JohnHumphrys is an outstanding broadcaster & will be missed. He is versatile, brave, with an underlying humanity who doesn\u2019t let anyone off the hook and rightly so (and occasionally annoying).\n\n#r4today @BBCr4today #legend https://t.co/aUg6jxITva\n\nDr Liam Fox MP (@LiamFox) Best wishes to John Humphrys for his last #r4today show. He is the most outstanding broadcaster of our generation. @BBCRadio4 @BBCr4today @BBC @sarahsands100\n\nIn a final send-off at the end of the programme Humphrys thanked the BBC.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot wrong with it as an organisation and it is facing massive challenges from social media and changing behaviour, but I believe we need the BBC as much now as we ever have done. I simply cannot imagine this country without it.\u201d\n\nHe also came close to choking up as he thanked listeners, saying: \u201cYou really are the backbone of our country. You care about our democracy. I am more proud than I can say that you have put up with me for so long.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday matters for tomorrow. And if that\u2019s a rather corny way to end my years on the programme well so be it. And that\u2019s it from me.\u201d\n\n\n\nFellow presenters past and present then applauded Humphrys as he hung up his headphones.", "description": "Top politicians shying away from scrutiny, says journalist as he bows out after 32 years on Radio 4 programme", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "Jane Martinson", "Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da39985a144fadd962837d83219b922bb0e2111/0_145_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c03c4225572a049185b09a63cd1e21b", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
