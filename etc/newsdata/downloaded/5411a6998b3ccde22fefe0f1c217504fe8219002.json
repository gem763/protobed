Henson for Khloe Kardashian: \u2018I wish I would have done things different\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Lamar Odom is opening up to a grave mistake he made before he dated Khloe Kardashian.\n\nThe former Los Angeles Lakers star opened up about his life in an interview for an upcoming episode of TVOne\u2019s \u201cUncensored.\u201d\n\nIn the newly released clip from Odom\u2019s conversation, the \u201cDarkness to Light: A Memoir\u201d author discussed his past relationship with actress Taraji P. Henson and the \u201cimmature\u201d decision he made to leave her the way he did for reality television star Khloe Kardashian.\n\n\u201cI wish I would have done things different with her,\u201d Odom said. \u201cShe was a little older than me, but I learned a lot from her because that was the most significant relationship as a grown-up that I had with a black woman.\u201d\n\nFANS CRY PHOTOSHOP AS KHLOE KARDASHIAN MORPHS INTO A HUMAN BARBIE\n\nThe former \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d contestant said his connection to Henson, 49, was one that stuck with him; he admitted that he kept a picture of the Oscar-nominated actress as a keepsake.\n\nLAMAR ODOM SLEPT WITH UP TO 6 WOMEN A WEEK, PAID FOR \u2018PLENTY OF ABORTIONS\u2019: BOOK\n\n\u201cI used to carry her picture on the road with me,\u201d Odom revealed in the clip. \u201cDon\u2019t nobody know that, except for the dudes that played with me. She gave me inspiration. A black woman working like that, that\u2019s just as good with her craft as I am in my craft.\u201d\n\nOdom, 39, who is now dating personal trainer Sabrina Parr, 32, recalled one specific game against the Cleveland Cavaliers in which Henson really inspired him on the court, as the lefty said he played one of his better games because of the \u201cEmpire\u201d actress.\n\nLAMAR ODOM REVEALS HE SUFFERED 12 STROKES, 6 HEART ATTACKS WHILE IN COMA\n\n\u201cI remember we were on the road for our longest road trip and we were playing Cleveland. And I went off on their a--,\u201d said Odom, adding: \u201cBut part of the inspiration of me going back to see her and getting back to LA was one of the reasons I kicked their a-- that night. I remember how I was feeling during that game and after that game. She inspired me.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the adoration Odom harbored for the \u201cBaby Boy\u201d star, he admitted that he broke things off in part because of his growing feelings for Kardashian and not being able to come to grips with the delicate situation facing him.\n\n\u201cThings ended with Taraji because of me being an immature punk. I didn\u2019t know how to tell her that I was falling in love with another woman named Khloe Kardashian,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOdom\u2019s episode of TVOne\u2019s \u201cUncensored\u201d airs on Sunday at 9 p.m. ET.", "description": "Lamar Odom is opening up to a grave mistake he made before he dated Khloe Kardashian.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Lamar-Odom-happy-Khloe-Kardashian-Mad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
