The New York Times had originally reported that Ivan Archivaldo had also been captured and released, citing people who asked not to be identified.\n\n\u201cThere are so many factors that point to the fact that he was there and they also released him,\u201d said Vigil. \u201cBut they\u2019ll never admit to it because they\u2019ve been lying from the get go.\u201d Vigil wouldn\u2019t disclose the sources behind his assertions, which couldn\u2019t be independently corroborated. He added that authorities have been misleading the public by playing down the amount of planning that went into the operation.\n\nLopez Obrador said at his daily news conference Wednesday that he had no information on whether Ivan Archivaldo had been captured and released. AMLO\u2019s press office strongly rejected Vigil\u2019s assertion that it misled the public on the botched arrest. \u201cThere\u2019s been an unusual amount of transparency, not only for Mexico but by international standards. The entire security cabinet was explaining every detail,\u201d said Jesus Cantu, the information chief of the president\u2019s press office. \u201cThe president himself said he\u2019d testify before the authorities if they considered he\u2019d done something illegal.\u201d\n\nHow AMLO\u2019s Plans to Transform Mexico Ran Into Reality: QuickTake\n\nLopez Obrador, known as AMLO, has been struggling to convince the public that his government took the right step by releasing Guzman Lopez after gunmen began attacking civilians in efforts to free him in the northern city of Culiacan, Sinaloa. Guzman Lopez is said to have taken over some of the criminal activities after his father was sentenced to life in a U.S. prison.\n\nInitially, Mexico\u2019s security chief, Alfonso Durazo, had said the troops had stumbled on Guzman Lopez by accident. Afterward, government officials said it was part of a planned operation. More recently, officials signaled that the arrest was approved by low-level law enforcement officials and cabinet ministers may not have been aware.\n\nWhile the president and Durazo have spoken of \u201cerrors\u201d regarding the operation, they\u2019ve been distancing themselves from it. AMLO, as the president is known, said Tuesday that he wasn\u2019t informed about the operation to capture Guzman Lopez.\n\nHe also confirmed that there was an extradition order for the alleged trafficker and raised questions about whether the minister of defense had even been informed about the operation. \u201cI think the Defense Ministry had knowledge of it, the minister? I don\u2019t know. I think so.\u201d\n\nJesus Ramirez, the president\u2019s spokesman and like Cantu is also from AMLO\u2019s press office, told Bloomberg News on Monday that Mexico attempted to detain Guzman Lopez upon request by the DEA for extradition. The DEA declined to comment and the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City directed inquiries to the White House press office, which hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment.\n\nVigil questioned why the authorities would target Guzman Lopez for extradition, when Chapo\u2019s other sons are far more active in the Sinaloa Cartel once run by their father. \u201cJesus Alfredo and Ivan Archivaldo are much more important than Ovidio,\u201d he said. \u201cMexico from the very beginning began distorting the truth in order to buy time so they could come up with a plausible deniability story.\u201d\n\n(Updates with AMLO\u2019s comment in fifth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Nacha Cattan in Mexico City at ncattan@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Juan Pablo Spinetto at jspinetto@bloomberg.net, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Mexico\u2019s government isn\u2019t being truthful about the botched attempt to capture the son of the world\u2019s most notorious drug trafficker, according to a former head of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.The administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador", "authors": ["Nacha Cattan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
