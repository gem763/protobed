Some can carry it off, but the masses need brow definition. Focus on the dark eyes, nude lip combo \u2013 it is one of the easiest ways to channel modernity without looking try-hard. Start with a skin finish foundation, but don\u2019t go overboard otherwise you\u2019ll look ancient. Minimalists can swap shadow for liner. To get the most authentic nude, use a shade that matches your natural lip colour, adding a lighter hue in the middle. And don\u2019t forget to put on your brows.\n\nEssentials\n\n1.

No, it\u2019s not a pottery-related pastime. Clay-based cleansers are highly moisturising, kind-to-scalp shampoo alternatives. Washing hair in this way has long been a thing within the natural/curly hair community. While everyone raves about how great it is for textured hair types like mine, I initially shied away from the process. My reticence was down to the fact that most clay-based products I had come across were in pots and masks. For me, these had \u2018messy\u2019 and \u2018high maintenance\u2019 written all over them. Now, however, I am sold. This particular offering, a French pink clay formulation, is wonderful. I immediately fell for the texture and the colour. It feels like a heavy but not stiff conditioner and looks like a strawberry-flavoured Angel Delight. You simply apply it to your hair and your scalp as you would your normal shampoo, and massage it in. It does not foam at all. For anyone who has been indoctrinated to love suds as much as I do, this was slightly disconcerting. So I was sceptical as to whether it would clean my hair. Thankfully it did that and so much more. My curls were detangled, super soft, incredibly defined and stayed that way all week. For those results, I am more than happy to go sud free.\n\nOn my radar: full lip service, a drop of dew, stylish scents\n\nGold standard I normally turn my nose up at \u2018wearable\u2019 fragrance products, but I love this. A gold-plated necklace with interchangeable perfume vials \u2013 what a gorgeous but practical way to travel with scent.
