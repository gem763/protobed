He deserves better than playing second fiddle to someone who calls himself KSI, no matter how many million internet hits that shamateur fight generates.\n\nErrol Spence celebrates in the ring after the split-decision result in his favour is announced\n\nBenn is a British boxing legend and will have to forgive us for our concerns about his health when he comes out of the past to re-enter the ring in Birmingham on November 23, even though the chief medical officer of the obscure body sanctioning that fight describes him as 'the fittest 55-year-old on planet Earth and only 35 physiologically.'\n\nThe hard old game suddenly found itself in a tough corner, until Errol Spence Jr and Shawn Porter came out of the darkness to light up our screens.\n\nThose of us who stayed up Saturday night or set the alarm at 4am on Sunday were treated to the Fight of the Year of 2019 so far.\n\nThe pace and intensity at which Spence the younger and Porter the elder set about unifying the world welterweight title almost defied belief.\n\nPorter (left) falls to the floor in the 11th round as Spence closed in on victory late on in LA\n\nThey went at each other through every minute of the full 12 rounds as if their lives depended on it. Which is probably what I felt like to them.\n\nWithout wishing to make false comparisons with two of the greatest boxers of all time, it is reasonable to suggest that here was a minor facsimile of Ali v Frazier.\n\nSpence the artist was dragged into a war by Smokin' Shawn.\n\nTo his enormous credit Errol the stylist sucked it up and answered all the questions about whether he has the heart, chin and spirit to go on to greatness.\n\nPorter gets back to his feet as referee Jack Weiss counts over him but the American continued\n\nJust as admirably Porter the brave never let his assault flag, not even after he was forced to prop a glove on the canvas by a left hook from hell which turned his face into a gargoyle for one gruesome moment.\n\nThat touch-down in the 11th round ensured that Spence won a decision which should not have been split by one rogue judge even if it had not happened.\n\nAlthough Spence did admit that he had courted a disastrous loss of his title and his unbeaten record by living the high life before going into training camp for the biggest fight of his young life to date.\n\nSpence connects with a right-hand on his way to extending his unbeaten record to 26-0\n\n'I've got to stop putting on weight between fights,' he told himself. 'I can't go up more than 25 lbs between fights and then spend camp getting the weight off. That's s***.' That it may be but in terms of our vicarious pleasure that lapse in dedication probably helped produce a more gripping battle than this battle might otherwise have been.\n\nFor Spence Jr, this was a lesson hard earned. One which should ensure we will have the pleasure of watching him develop into a legend in his own right, through fights against the likes of Danny Garcia Terence Crawford. Danny Garcia, Keith Thurman and perhaps even Manny Pacquiao.\n\nSpence and Porter did themselves proud. They also provided a service to boxing which happened to be much-needed this weekend.\n\nPorter persevered throughout a gripping fight, connecting here with a left-hand on Spence\n\nSpence's arm is raised by the referee as he holds his IBF and now WBC welterweight titles", "description": "First we had Billy Joe Saunders doing his level best to convince us how delighted he is to be defending his world super-middleweight title on the undercard of a YouTube circus act in America.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/00/19065132-0-image-a-23_1569885225755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
