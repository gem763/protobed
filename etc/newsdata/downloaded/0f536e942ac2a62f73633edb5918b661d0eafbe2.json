Their new contracts represent the largest such deal in Australian media history\n\nSources confirmed Sandilands, 48, and Henderson, 44, were on the same huge base salary, which has been estimated to have risen from at least $4million to $8million a year. They are pictured in 2006\n\nThis week Radio Today quoted a source who estimated the Kyle & Jackie O Show would have made ARN between $50million and $100million each year since 2014.\n\nTalks between Sandilands, Henderson and the network began about two months ago and according to radio insiders were conducted with a minimum of fuss.\n\nBruno Bouchet, who represents Sandilands, and Brad March, who manages Henderson, dealt with ARN executives on their clients' behalf but would not comment on negotiations.\n\nHowever, Daily Mail Australia spoke to several industry insiders about how the monumental deal would have gone down.\n\nOne noted the breakfast duo already had two years to run on their contracts after 2019 so there was no rush for any deal to be done.\n\n'There was still 24 months to go but I think that Kyle and Jackie and management all have a pretty good relationship and they were keen to lock it in for even longer,' that radio source said.\n\n'There was no one who officially said let's get this going. I mean the thing is Kyle and Jackie speak to management pretty much every day.'\n\nSandilands and Henderson, who have dominated the FM breakfast market for more than a decade, conduct their negotiations separately but are so successful as a team their contracts need to be fixed at the same time. They are pictured with singer Dannii Minogue in 2003\n\nSandilands has described his new salary as an 'absurd amount of money' but Australian Radio Network (ARN), parent company of KIIS FM, is happy to pay it. He and Henderson are pictured with singer Kelly Clarkson in 2003\n\nARN chief executive Ciaran Davis had an office near the Kyle & Jackie O Show studio so the on-air talent were 'always having a chat' with the boss, the source said.\n\n'I think from both sides it just felt like they were keen to extend it, thinking a few years ahead, not just a few months,' he said.\n\n'Both parties were really keen to make that deal. There were no games played. They wanted Kyle and Jackie there, Kyle and Jackie wanted to be there and that's it. No need for drama.'\n\nDaily Mail Australia understands reports that Sandilands and Henderson are each on about $8million for the next five years are accurate and the $80million that will cost ARN is seen in the industry as good value.\n\n'The reality is you've got your number one FM Sydney show and you're able to tell the market we're going to keep this relationship going until the end of 2024,' an insider said.\n\n'It shows solidarity and it shows a strong vision. It's good news for everyone.'\n\nHenderson has been on the same salary as Sandilands since her last contract, which was also negotiated by low-profile master manager March in 2016.\n\nThe Kyle & Jackie O Show is Sydney's top-rating FM breakfast program, with an audience share of 11.6 per cent. It is beaten only by 2GB's Alan Jones with 16.8 per cent on his AM show.\n\nJones and his 2GB mornings colleague Ray Hadley are each paid a reported $4million a year.\n\nSandilands will not confirm or deny his salary is $8million, but is not upset by that number being bandied about.\n\n'I don't discuss the absurd amount of money I get given to do something I love,' he said after his new contract was announced.\n\n'Don't get me wrong, the money's fantastic, but what really counts for me is the acknowledgment that what Jackie and I have created is one of the most successful shows on earth.'\n\nBouchet said of his client's salary: 'He keeps on saying if anyone asks just tell them it's an absurd amount of money. He likes that quote.'\n\nHenderson said this week she loved working with her 'best friend' every day. 'Kyle and I truly love our listeners, our incredible guests, and have so much fun working together,' she said\n\nSandilands has described his and Henderson's new contracts as the biggest media deal in Australian history.\n\n'It's bigger than any TV deal anyone's done, and bigger than any radio deal anyone's done,' he said.\n\nThe pairs' contracts now rank them among the highest-paid radio personalities in the world.\n\nARN national content director Duncan Campbell said Sandilands and Henderson, who have worked together since the early 2000s, were among the most loved personalities on radio.\n\n'I am proud to say they, along with the strength of our broader network talent, are a big part of ARN's plans for the future,' he said.\n\nSandilands said this week he had felt at home at KIIS since he and Henderson took their show to ARN from the Southern Cross Austereo-owned 2Day FM at the start of 2014.\n\n'Obviously Jackie and I decided to re-sign with ARN, we launched KIIS 106.5 so we really feel like it's our station,' he said.\n\n'Plus our show keeps getting better every year. It's a great time for us and for radio in Sydney.'\n\nIn her own statement, Henderson said she loved working with her 'best friend' every day.\n\n'Kyle and I truly love our listeners, our incredible guests, and have so much fun working together,' she said.\n\n'Not many people get to go to work each day to share stories, laugh with their best friend and create entertainment that hopefully makes our listener's day that little bit lighter - that isn't lost on me.\n\n'We're so grateful to be able to continue this journey with ARN.'\n\nAs for whether Sandilands and Henderson could double their salary again when this contract expired, one insider said the pair would not be thinking that far ahead.\n\nFive years from now Sandilands would be 53 and Henderson 49.\n\n'I don't know, I think they both acknowledge they're on a pretty good wicket,' the insider said. 'I don't think they'd be thinking about that now.'\n\nSandilands will not confirm or deny his salary is $8million, but is not upset by that number being bandied about. 'I don't discuss the absurd amount of money I get given to do something I love,' he said after his new contract was announced.
