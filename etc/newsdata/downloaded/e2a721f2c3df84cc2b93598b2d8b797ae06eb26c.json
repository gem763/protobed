As we have said before, we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015. We made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information which app developers could access,\" Harry Kinmonth, the director and associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement.\n\nThe statement added that protecting people's privacy and information is one of its top priorities and \"we look forward to continuing to cooperate with the ICO\u2019s wider and ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes.\u201d\n\nJames Dipple-Johnstone, the deputy commissioner of the ICO, said it \"welcomes the agreement reached with Facebook\" in a statement.\n\n\"The ICO\u2019s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm. Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy,\" Dipple-Johnstone added.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that one developer, GSR, harvested private data from up to 87 million Facebook users around the world without their knowledge.\n\nSome of this data was then shared with other organizations including SCL Group, the parent company to data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on digital political campaigning in the 2016 election.\n\nIn the U.K., the ICO found that at least 1 million British users were among those whose private data had been compromised.\n\nABC News' Julia Macfarlane contributed to this report.", "description": "Facebook admits to no liability as part of the agreement.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/facebook-app-rtr-jc-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
