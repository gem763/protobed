A situation caused by the Turks\u2026 Despite our opposition they decided to make this incursion into Syria,\u201d Esper told CBS.\n\n\u201cAnd at this point in time in the last 24 hours we learned that they likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned and to the west\n\n\u201cWe also have learned in the last 24 hours that the\u2026 SDF are looking to cut a deal, if you will, with the Syrians and the Russians to counter-attack against the Turks in the north.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Immediate defensive action\u2019 \u2013\n\nAsked if troops would be leaving the country altogether, Esper clarified that the withdrawal was just from northern Syria, \u201cwhich is where most of our forces are.\u201d\n\nFighting raged along the border on the fifth day of an offensive that has provoked an international outcry and left dozens of civilians and fighters dead.\n\nAnkara launched the long-threatened offensive against the SDF, which it considers \u201cterrorists\u201d linked to insurgents inside Turkey, after Trump ordered American special forces serving as a trip wire against Turkish action to pull back from the border.\n\nThe US withdrawal provoked a bipartisan firestorm of outrage and accusations that Trump was abandoning a loyal ally in the fight against Islamic State militants.\n\nTrump tweeted Sunday that it was \u201cvery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years\u2026 Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\u201d he said.\n\nHundreds of relatives of foreign jihadists escaped from a displacement camp in northern Syria, Kurdish authorities said Sunday, as the number of people fleeing the Turkish assault soared to 130,000.\n\nUS troops near the northern border came under artillery fire from Turkish positions on Friday, the Pentagon said, warning that the US was prepared to meet aggression with \u201cimmediate defensive action.\u201d\n\nThe US military confirmed an explosion within a few hundred meters of its post near the town of Kobani, in an area \u201cknown by the Turks to have US forces present.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Friday that Trump had authorized \u2014 but not yet activated \u2014 new sanctions to dissuade Turkey from further offensive military action.\n\n\u201cWe can shut down all US dollar transactions with the entire government of Turkey,\u201d Mnuchin told ABC on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we may do. There\u2019s full authority and something at a moment\u2019s notice the president can tell me to do.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The Pentagon said Sunday President Donald Trump had ordered the withdrawal of up to 1,000 troops from northern Syria \u2014 almost the", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/5bec4a_us-troops-soldier-pictured-in-syrian-village-al-hashisha-on-september-2019-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
