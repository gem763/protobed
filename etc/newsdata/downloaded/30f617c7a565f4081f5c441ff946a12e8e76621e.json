It was not immediately clear how much more time he would have to serve on the D.C. sentence if the petition is granted by a judge. Lawyers said that could depend on how sentencing rules, including those regarding \u201cgood time\u201d credit, might affect his case.\n\nIn February, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia filed a motion requesting that Edmond\u2019s life sentence be reduced, but prosecutors didn\u2019t initially offer a specific recommendation.\n\nEdmond had cooperated with authorities over nearly two decades, helping them understand the workings of the drug trade and convict some 100 other dealers, prosecutors said. In addition, they said Edmond helped in the investigations of numerous cold-case slayings, offering details about friendships, rivalries or feuds among victims and suspects.\n\nThe final say on whether Edmonds gets a break will rest with U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan.\n\nEdmond\u2019s attorney, Jason Downs, Friday declined to comment on the filing. But in previous court filings, Downs had repeatedly told the judge he believed Edmond should be given time served in exchange for his cooperation.\n\n\n\nRayful Edmond III, 54, oversaw an operation that brought up to 1,700 pounds of cocaine a month into the District in the mid-1980s.\n\nA hearing is scheduled in October before Sullivan where witnesses on behalf of Edmond are expected to testify. Sullivan also ordered Edmond to be present. Edmond, who is currently in witness protection as a result of his cooperation, appeared at a hearing earlier via television monitor from an undisclosed prison.\n\n[Rayful Edmond III appears at first hearing for early release from prison, via video conference]\n\nEdmond, 54, oversaw an operation that brought up to 1,700 pounds of cocaine a month into the District in the mid-1980s. At one point, law enforcement officials estimated he was raking in as much as $2 million a week.\n\nThe crack cocaine epidemic also contributed to the city\u2019s rising homicide rate at the time, pushing Washington to be nicknamed the \u201cnation\u2019s murder capital.\u201d Authorities said Edmond\u2019s enforcers were linked to as many as 30 slayings, although Edmond was never convicted in any homicides.\n\nFollowing his arrest in 1989 and a jury trial in federal court, Edmond was sentenced to life without parole for drug distribution in the District.\n\nThe resentencing request comes as federal prosecutors in the District have objected to a move by city lawmakers to expand a law that allows people who committed serious crimes as juveniles to seek early release after serving 15 years in prison. An amendment before the D.C. Council would increase the pool of eligible applicants to those who were as old as 24 when they offended.\n\nJessie K. Liu, the U.S. attorney for the District, has noted that Edmond has served more than 30 years and that he was not convicted of a violent crime.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision in the D.C. case will not directly impact the 30-year sentence that Edmond has yet to serve for a separate conviction in Pennsylvania for dealing drugs from a prison there. Prosecutors in Pennsylvania have not indicated if they too plan to request a reduction. Edmond has not yet begun serving that sentence because it runs consecutive to his life sentence.\n\n[D.C. residents split nearly evenly on whether \u201980s drug kingpin Rayful Edmond\u2019s prison sentence should be shortened]\n\nLast week, the District\u2019s attorney general office released a survey where about 500 D.C. residents were nearly evenly split on whether they believed Edmond should have his sentenced reduced or if he should remain in prison for life.\n\nRead more:\n\nFound insane in one killing, D.C. man killed again, police say\n\n\u2018Aryan\u2019 and \u2018Octoroon\u2019: Couples challenge racial labels to get married in Virginia\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not giving you the power\u2019: Sister confronts twin\u2019s killer in Va. courtroom\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Edmond still has a 30-year sentence in Pennsylvania he has not begun serving", "authors": ["Keith L.
