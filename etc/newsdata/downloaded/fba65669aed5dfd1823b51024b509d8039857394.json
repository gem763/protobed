The new entry-level EV is less powerful and lighter than its predecessors, and it will be available for purchase in 2020, Porsche said.\n\nThe luxury automaker's latest offering houses an all-wheel-drive layout and two battery size options. The standard battery delivers up to 522-horsepower and the higher-end version offers up to 563-horsepower.\n\nThe Taycan 4S can travel 253 miles on a single charge and has a $103,800 starting price. By comparison, Porsche's Turbo starts at $150,900, and the Turbo S starts at $185,000. The Turbo can travel up to 280 miles on a charge, and the premium Turbo S has a range of 256 miles.\n\nIt's a bird. Its a plane!

Tesla's luxury Model S has a 345-mile drive range.\n\nOn the exterior, Porsche's new sedan looks very similar to the brand's Turbo iteration. However, the 4S is more compact with a redesigned front end, and it comes with red brake calipers, the company said. The latest Taycan has smaller, 19-inch wheels.\n\nThe interior of the car is leather-free, to \"underscore the sustainable concept of the electric sports car,\" the automaker said.\n\nThe Taycan 4S can be ordered immediately and is scheduled to arrive next spring.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/10/14/porsche-taycan-4-s-entry-level-ev/3973213002/", "description": "Porsche packed in an all-wheel-drive layout and two battery size options that offer a slightly better range than the Turbo and Turbo S.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
