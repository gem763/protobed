Nwankpa \"the head of Drexel\u2019s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has \"submitted improper charges against federal grants. The majority of the charges were made to gentlemen\u2019s clubs and sports bars in the Philadelphia area.\"\n\nAccording to the press release, Dr. Nwankpa \"repaid $53,328 to Drexel, resigned his position in lieu of termination, and was debarred from federal government contracting for a period of six months.\"\n\n\"This is an example of flagrant and audacious fraud, and a shameful misuse of public funds.\" U.S. Attorney William McSwain said. \"The agencies providing these grant funds expect them to be used towards advancements in energy and naval technology for public benefit, not for personal entertainment.\"\n\nDrexel and the professor had complied with federal authorities throughout its investigation.\n\n\"We appreciate Drexel\u2019s self-disclosure and cooperation in this matter,\" McSwain added. \"At the same time, we are disappointed that Dr. Nwankpa\u2019s conduct went unnoticed for so long, but Drexel\u2019s strengthening of its charge approval process is certainly a step in the right direction.\"\n\nNwankpa's dalliances were made from 2007 - 2017. Apparently, his favorite spots in the City of Brotherly Love were Cheerleaders, Club Risque, and Tacony Club. He also purchased audio off iTunes using federal grant money.", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:36:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/152/6c29f792-6439-4755-9fef-d97227c4d420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
