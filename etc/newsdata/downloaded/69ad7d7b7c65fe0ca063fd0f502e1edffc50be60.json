LOUIS (AP) - Ryan Braun still stands out at opportune times for the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as good as I was,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cBut in big moments, I\u2019m the guy still.\u201d\n\nBraun hit a go-ahead grand slam off Junior Fern\u00e1ndez with two outs in the ninth inning, and the Brewers beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-6 Sunday to keep up their playoff push by winning for the ninth time in 10 games.\n\nMilwaukee remained one game behind the Chicago Cubs for the second NL wild card and closed within three games of the NL Central-leading Cardinals.\n\nWith the Cardinals ahead 4-3, Jon Gant (10-1) walked Ben Gamel and Travis Shaw starting the ninth, struck out Trent Grisham and walked Yasmani Grandal.\n\nTyler Webb retired Mike Moustakas on a flyout not deep enough to score a run, Fern\u00e1ndez relieved and Braun drove a hanging slider to left-center for his seventh career slam and a 7-4 lead.\n\n\u201cWe had one bullet left,\u201d Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said. \u201cAbsolutely incredible.\u201d\n\nA six-time All-Star, Braun entered with a .133 batting average in September. He hit a tiebreaking home run against Miami on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI believe in myself. I\u2019ve had a lot of success in those moments,\u201d Braun said. \u201cI think I\u2019m able to lock it in a little bit more.\u201d\n\nTommy Edman hit a two-run homer with one out in the bottom of the ninth off Josh Hader, who struck out Harrison Bader and pinch-hitter Tyler O\u2019Neill for his 33rd save in 39 chances.\n\nBader hit solo homers in the third and seventh innings totaling 909 feet, giving him 10 homers this season.\n\nMatt Albers (7-5) got two outs for the win, and Gant lost for the first time in exactly one year.\n\nCory Spangenberg hit a two-run homer off Ryan Helsley in the seventh, but Paul DeJong had a two-run homer against Ray Black in the bottom half for a 3-2 lead, a drive that curled just inside the left-field foul pole.\n\nMilwaukee starter Chase Anderson allowed one run and one hit over in four innings.\n\nCardinals starter Michael Wacha gave up five hits in five scoreless innings and is 0-3 in eight starts and two relief appearances since beating Cincinnati on July 19.\n\nSLUGGING\n\nMilwaukee set a franchise record with 232 homers, one more than in 2007.\n\nEASY PICKINGS?\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s final 13 games are against San Diego, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Colorado, all teams with losing records.\n\nDEFENSE UP\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 nine-game streak without an error, the team\u2019s longest since June 2017, ended when Bader bobbled a long drive to center by Moustakas in the eighth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCardinals: Closer Carlos Martinez spent Saturday night in a hospital due to respiratory issues and was not at the ballpark Sunday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: RHP Zach Davies (9-7, 3.77) will take on San Diego RHP Garrett Richards (0-0, 0.00) on Monday in the opener of a four-game series in Milwaukee. The Brewers are 16-12 in his starts this season.\n\nCardinals: RHP Dakota Hudson (15-7, 3.38) faces Washington RHP Stephen Strasburg (17-6, 3.49) on Monday. Hudson had a career-best five-game winning streak ended with a 2-1 loss to Colorado on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ryan Braun still stands out at opportune times for the Milwaukee Brewers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Overbey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/brewers_cardinals_baseball_88031_c0-144-3452-2156_s1770x1032.jpg?70e7f13edf12b523fe0faff8cb2cd1d18f177355", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
