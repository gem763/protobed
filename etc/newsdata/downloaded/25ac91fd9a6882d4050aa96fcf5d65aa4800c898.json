That is due in large part to the fact that the standard dress for royal men is, well, predictable. That's not to say a great tailored suit isn't noteworthy, but it's not raising any eyebrows, you know? But when you're emerging out of a technicolor tut tut and you want to flex for the cameras, a suit simply will not do. Thus, we have Prince William in this incredible emerald green sherwani. Go off, king. Sorry, prince.\n\nPhoto credit: Chris Jackson - Getty Images More\n\nPrince William and Duchess Kate attended a special reception at the Pakistan Monument, where the royal donned a sherwani designed by Naushemian\u2014the same designer responsible for much of Middleton's look during the couple's visit to Pakistan. While the garment looks pretty stellar as is, it's a big moment considering that it's the first time a British royal has sported the traditional outfit, according to The Telegraph.\n\nWhile initially synonymous with India, the sherwani's presence has become more and more prominent in Pakistan over the past few decades. The popularity has since exploded, which is why even Prince William is getting in on the action. The deep green coat, a nod to the Pakistani flag, is adorned with traditional beading, but it's the less traditional additions that really help it pop. With a silver watch and black boots, the whole ensemble is a step up for the prince.\n\nAnd bonus? Sherwanis don't require ties. The look may not be his regular wear back at Kensington Palace, but damn if he doesn't make a case for it.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "He's the first British royal to don the traditional garment.", "authors": ["Justin Kirkland"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TyjDlj318wBdHv9BEFiPmQ--~B/aD01MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_269/288697644ad46f9fdb7f93290d7e9633", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
