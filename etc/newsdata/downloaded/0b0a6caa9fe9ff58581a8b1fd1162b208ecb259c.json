To steal a sample sentence from Blake, consider, \u201cFaith, hope and love remain.\u201d Some, including Blake, would argue a comma isn\u2019t necessary after \u201chope\u201d because context dictates \u201cfaith, hope, and love\u201d belong to the same series. But as I, the reader, gaze over the sentence, I consume it left to right and, although quickly, only a word or two at a time.\n\nAs my eyes pass from the comma after \u201cfaith\u201d to the word \u201chope\u201d absent a comma, the missing punctuation signals to my brain that I am not looking at a series, but rather an instance of direct address. (This is particularly noteworthy because while people usually use the presence of imprecise appositives in defense of the Oxford comma, missing serial commas even complicate direct address.)\n\nThe sentence \u201cFaith, hope and love remain,\u201d could just as easily convey that the writer is telling a girl named Faith that hope and love remain. Of course, by the time I reach the end of the sentence, I\u2019ve realized that isn\u2019t the message the writer intended to communicate, but by then I\u2019m probably rewinding to re-read the sentence under new contextual enlightenment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kylee Zempel", "Thefederalist.Com Using-The-Oxford-Comma-Is-A-Sign-Of-Grace-And-Clarity"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
