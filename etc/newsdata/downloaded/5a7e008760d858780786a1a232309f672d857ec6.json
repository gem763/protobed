Photo: Courtesy of the vendors\n\nSephora and Ulta aren\u2019t the only places that have major beauty sales, it turns out. This week, Walmart \u2014 of all places \u2014 introduced what they\u2019re calling a \u201cFall Into Beauty Sale.\u201d (Get it?) Until October 6, a ton of makeup and nail products are up to half the price on Walmart\u2019s site, something I found out while trawling the internet for beauty deals, as one does. I snooped through the sale and, to my surprise, Walmart actually has a lot of really great beauty brands and products \u2014 many of which are insanely cheap right now. Below, the best of the best from the sale.\n\nStila Stay All Day Eyeliner $18 (was $22, now 18% off) This liquid liner from Stila is truly one is the best I\u2019ve ever used. Not only is it super easy to apply \u2014 you don\u2019t have to tug or pull a lot get that great precision \u2014 it also stays put all night long. My sister put me onto this liner and I\u2019ve never looked back. $18 at Walmart Buy\n\nReal Techniques Eye Shadow and Blender Makeup Brush Duo + Miracle Complexion Makeup Blender Sponge $7 (was $9, now 22% off) Technically speaking (no pun intended), these brushes are meant to apply eye shadow. But I personally love using them as concealer brushes \u2014 the small, feathery, soft bristles allow for really great targeted blending and spot concealing. $7 at Walmart Buy\n\nReal Techniques Expert Face Makeup Brush + Miracle Complexion Makeup Blender Sponge $10 (was $13, now 23% off) Real Techniques is already so affordable that when their stuff goes on sale everything is basically the cost of a single La Colombe coffee. For instance, this buffing brush, which I already own and adore, and which is great for blending foundation seamlessly into the skin without any cakiness. $10 at Walmart Buy\n\nStila Glitter and Glow Liquid Eye Shadow, Diamond Dust $19 (was $24, now 21% off) Holiday season is just around the corner and these Stila eyeshadows are perfect for office Christmas parties. What I love most about this product is the doe-foot applicator, which lets you easily use this as an eyeshadow (one big swipe and you\u2019re done) or as an eyeliner. A sparkly wing for the holidays? How cute! $19 at Walmart Buy\n\nUrban Decay Naked Skin Shapeshifter Palette, Light/Medium $36 (was $45, now 20% off) This is a cream and powder double-whammy contour and highlight kit. For nights out when you want to create defined, long-lasting chisel and highlight, you can go ahead and reach for the powder. But if you want to do a subtle contour and highlight, or if your skin is a little drier today than usual, you can use the blendable cream formula. There\u2019s also an under-eye color corrector in this, which I think is so genius! $36 at Walmart Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
