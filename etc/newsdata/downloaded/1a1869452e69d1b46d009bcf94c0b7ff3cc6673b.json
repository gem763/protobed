McGee showed off his veteran savvy Wednesday by deploying one of the most effective gimmicks we\u2019ve seen just so he could get an easy bucket in a preseason game.\n\nIn the third quarter of Wednesday\u2019s preseason game vs. the Golden State Warriors, McGee appeared to injure his leg during a play. He limps off the court to tend to the injury ... or does he.\n\nTurns out, McGee was just waiting for his defender to forget about him. Once that happens, the 31-year-old McGee runs back on the court, catches a pass from Anthony Davis and picks up an easy dunk.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere\u2019s what it looked like in real time:\n\nJaVale sneaky as hell for pulling that off \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/otFyzzqzJm \u2014 SLAM (@SLAMonline) October 17, 2019\n\nMcGee\u2019s move is, admittedly, a little cheap. It\u2019s perhaps bad etiquette to fake an injury during a game to score points. At the same time, scoring points is hard enough in the NBA, and it was entertaining, so we\u2019ll let it slide. Also, it was the preseason.\n\nUltimately, that\u2019s the great disappointment here. McGee showed off this move during a preseason game and not a regular-season game. Now defenders are going to be on high alert every time McGee has a cramp during the season.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
