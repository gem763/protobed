The announcement triggered howls of fury from hawks in Congress and the media, as well as sudden experts in Middle Eastern politics who cried that leaving Syria would abandon the Kurds to be torn apart by Turkey.\n\n....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.

While Turkey had originally negotiated with the US regarding the creation of the safe zone, Ankara warned last month that if Washington continued to stall the process it would establish the zone alone.
