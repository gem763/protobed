No matter what violence or illegalities they seem to commit, they pretty much get away with it with only a few arrests here and there. What\u2019s more, the media that may as well sport pompoms when they talk about Antifa, further putting social pressure on lawmakers to look the other way when it comes to Antifa\u2019s crimes.\n\nNot in Boston, however.\n\nAs Sister Toldjah wrote earlier on Wednesday, 36 members of Antifa were arrested as they assaulted citizens and police while trying to disrupt the parade. The members were charged with various charges, including assault and battery of officers as well as assault with a dangerous weapon. Members of \u201cThe Squad,\u201d including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley tried to fundraise for the Antifa attackers and were roasted by the Boston Police Union.\n\nBoston PD has released log of arrested individuals from Saturday\u2019s antifa counter-protest against the Straight Pride.

The judge\u2019s refusal to drop the charges at the request of prosecutors drew criticism from District Attorney Rachael Rollins, the ACLU and others. Rollins said in a statement issued Tuesday night that Sinnott \u201cpunished the exercise of individuals\u2019 First Amendment right to protest\u201d and said she would \u201cuse the legal process to remedy the judge\u2019s overstepping of his role\u201d for \u201cthose people now tangled in the criminal justice system for exercising their right to free speech.\u201d\n\nWhile the left seems displeased, others are relieved.\n\n\u201cThe charges are serious, and I appreciate the judge \u2026 not throwing them out of court,\u201d said Boston Patrolmen\u2019s Association President Michael Leary. \u201cI thought there\u2019d be some dismissals and people walking out of court high-fiving each other, thinking they had a victory of some sort, but I was very happy with what happened today.\u201d\n\nAccording to WGBH, Leary told them in a phone interview that these arrests were rightfully made, and that his officers were forced to arrest these Antifa members due to their violence.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t arrest people frivolously, we arrest people because they\u2019re committing crimes, and we don\u2019t want our police officers assaulted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to do their jobs, and people are throwing things at them, calling them terrorists, all kinds of crazy names. \u2026 We\u2019re just trying to keep the peace.\u201d", "description": "Antifa Thought It Could Get Away with Violence Against Boston\u2019s \u201cStraight Pride Parade,\u201d but a Judge Is Ruining Their Day", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Sarah Lee", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Antifa-Berkeley.jpg"}
