Deflation is over. Yet Japan\u2019s stock market is widely reviled, valued even more cheaply than the struggling eurozone.\n\nInvestors think Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s \u201cthree arrows\u201d of loose monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and reform of capital and jobs markets have misfired since he started Abenomics in 2012, and that they won\u2019t reach their mark any time soon.\n\nI prefer another interpretation: Japan\u2019s stock market is dominated by economically and currency-sensitive cyclical stocks whose profits have soared but could crash back to the ground if the global slowdown worsens. Investors don\u2019t value such cyclical profits very highly anywhere, and they value Japan\u2019s cyclical profits even less.\n\nYet Abenomics isn\u2019t such a dud as many investors seem to think\u2014in fact, it scored some hits\u2014and Japan\u2019s stocks merit watching if the global economy turns up.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What action are you taking with Japanese stocks--buying them or staying away? Join the conversation below.\n\nIt is both obvious that Abenomics hasn\u2019t hit its target, and at the same time overly harsh to deem the prime minister\u2019s efforts a complete failure. Inflation remains well below the 2% goal set shortly after his election, despite some of the loosest monetary policy ever seen outside Zimbabwe. But after almost two decades of deflation, the fact that there\u2019s any inflation at all is a triumph.\n\nGovernment spending didn\u2019t offer much of a boost, and Mr. Abe shot the fiscal arrow into his foot in 2014 when his sales-tax rise caused a recession. Fiscal stimulus is now a thing of the past, and this week he raised the tax again, although offsetting spending is likely to prevent a serious downturn. The overall government budget is on track for the smallest deficit next year since the post-bubble recession of 1993, according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund, something which can\u2019t help inflation.\n\nThe reform program has been more effective, helping encourage better allocation of capital by companies and supporting the existing trend of more women joining the workforce.\n\nEarnings per share have risen faster even than in the U.S. recently, according to MSCI data. And figures collected by the Ministry of Finance show operating profit margins for big nonfinancial companies not far from the peak of 8.6% reached in the second quarter of last year, far above the 2007 high of 5.7%.\n\nHistorically, shareholders wouldn\u2019t give companies credit for high profits because they could never get their hands on the money. Better corporate governance gives hope that less of it will be frittered away, and should support valuations. At the same time, Japanese manufacturers have improved their productivity since Abenomics began, at a time when most of the developed world has seen productivity growth slow, according to Conference Board data. (The Bank of Japan puts part of the blame for too-low inflation on productivity growth.)\n\nBut there\u2019s still a problem: Japan\u2019s huge manufacturers are heavily exposed to global trade troubles and to the value of the yen, and profit margins have been falling fast as both move against them.\n\nThe nonmanufacturing sector is more domestic and hasn\u2019t been hit the same way, but its operating profit margin of 5.4% has been flat since 2016. That doesn\u2019t support a story of continuous improvement, even if it is far above the pre-Abe norm.\n\nShigeto Nagai, a former BoJ official now at Oxford Economics, argues that the single biggest change produced by Abenomics was to correct the overvaluation of the yen, which helped exporters most. The relatively muted gains of the yen in the race to safety this summer supports the idea that there\u2019s less danger to Japanese stocks from a strong currency, but it\u2019s too early to be sure.\n\nInvestors looking for cheap stocks shouldn\u2019t be misled by the overall valuation of the market. MSCI Japan trades at 13.3 times estimated 12-month-forward earnings, exactly in line with the world excluding the U.S., and far behind the U.S.\u2019s 17.4 times.\n\nThe country has the cheapest financials, the cheapest industrials, and the cheapest consumer discretionary companies, a sector that includes upmarket retailers and car makers. Taken together, those three sectors account for half the market, more than the U.S., U.K., eurozone or emerging markets. If the world economy picks up, these stocks should do well, but few want to make that bet at the moment.\n\nLook at the more-defensive sectors and the bargains are hard to see. Makers and sellers of consumer staples (such as toothpaste, alcohol and tobacco) are more expensive than in other developed markets, as are health-care stocks. Japan\u2019s energy and utilities sectors are cheap, but the fourth-biggest utility by market value is Tokyo Electric Power Co. , of Fukushima meltdown infamy, which trades at just 3.7 times forecast earnings. The energy sector is tiny, and its biggest stock barely profitable.\n\nInvestors who think the world economy can escape the doldrums and trade wars be resolved should consider Japanese stocks. Others should take heart from the improving productivity and corporate governance and the possibility that the yen is losing some of its haven status, but shouldn\u2019t get too excited by the cheapness.\n\nWrite to James Mackintosh at James.Mackintosh@wsj.com", "description": "Profits are up.
