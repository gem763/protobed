(PHOTO: Anthony Kwan/Getty Images)\n\nBy Michelle Jamrisko\n\nBloomberg) -- Hong Kong\u2019s political turmoil has prompted some capital to move to Singapore though there hasn\u2019t been a flood of inflows from the former British colony, according to Singapore\u2019s central bank.\n\nThe city state\u2019s banks have seen an uptick in those inquiring about how to re-allocate assets, which is reasonable to expect, Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in an interview Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe smart money will stay put and watch: start planning, make inquiries, make contingency plans, but they wouldn\u2019t be in a big rush to move,\u201d he said. In terms of actual flows, \u201cthere are some signs of that happening. But we don\u2019t think it\u2019s significant or substantial,\u201d he said.\n\nSingapore\u2019s officials have emphasised that the disruptions in Hong Kong aren\u2019t helpful for the region\u2019s economies, even as some figures suggest it\u2019s gaining from the turmoil in its financial-center rival. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates as much as $4 billion has moved from Hong Kong dollar deposits to Singapore as of August amid the ongoing protests.\n\nMenon said that Singapore\u2019s official read on the flows lacks granularity because it doesn\u2019t employ capital controls and there are confidentiality constraints on accessing private banking figures.\n\nWhile financial flows have probably shown a \u201csmall\u201d increase there are no signs of acceleration, he said, declining to elaborate on an estimate. There\u2019s been a rise of inquiries from people \u201cabout how they may want to reconfigure how their assets are deployed,\u201d he said.\n\nA surge in capital flows from Hong Kong would be a worrying sign for the region, according to the MAS chief. \u201cThat means things have taken a turn for the worse, and that means prospects for the rest of Asia are also taking a turn for the worse,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the impact of inflows on monetary policy, Menon said that managing large inflows and outflows is \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the MAS\u2019s job and \u201cnot a particular challenge,\u201d given that it\u2019s not unusual for those flows to exceed Singapore\u2019s gross domestic product in some months.\n\nForeign-currency deposits at both domestic and international banks operating in Singapore rose to S$12.8 billion ($9.4 billion) in August, according to MAS data. The bulk of the increase took place in July and August, when the figure rose a record S$5 billion in total, the data show.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s political turmoil has prompted some capital to move to Singapore though there hasn\u2019t been a flood of inflows from the former British colony, according to Singapore\u2019s central bank.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LgE.i1p7hL.vaZ2mB1.zyA--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9ea6c790-f644-11e9-a9fe-049c49f0b4a2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
