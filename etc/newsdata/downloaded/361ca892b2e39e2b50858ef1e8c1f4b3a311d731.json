I don't really understand.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nRebekah hit back at the claims saying she \"doesn't need the money\" and slamming Coleen for causing her stress when she is heavily pregnant.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail , she claimed arguing with Coleen was like \"arguing with a pigeon\".\n\nStacey revealed she didn't agree with Rebekah's course of action either, and believes she should have ignored Coleen's claims.\n\nShe said: \"But then I don't get Rebekah Vardy's side either because if I was Rebekah and I knew I had done nothing and felt like someone had put it out there for me, I wouldn't even reply, I would just send a lawyer's letter.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\nIn a blistering statement, Becky accused other people of accessing her Instagram and said she was \"disgusted\" by Coleen's allegations.\n\nThe pregnant I'm A Celebrity star wrote: \"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\"I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\nBecky added a broken heart emoji to the bottom of her statement.", "description": "The Loose Women star has criticised both parties' behaviour in the furious spat between Coleen and Rebekah", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Twitter", "Getty Images", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563504.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Loose-Women-TV-show-London-UK-11-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
