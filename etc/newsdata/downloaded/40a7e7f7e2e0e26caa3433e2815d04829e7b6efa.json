He needed a home-equity loan for renovations including a full downstairs bathroom, an air conditioner so Angela could breathe in the Florida heat, and porch screening so his wife could be outside even with her \u201cextreme allergy to the bugs in the area.\u201d\n\nHe also needed the money to cover the burial costs he worried were coming.\n\nRennick didn\u2019t get the money.\n\nJames Rennick and his wife Angela were both cremated because there wasn\u2019t enough money for the more expensive option of burial, court papers said.\n\nA mortgage broker said there was a problem with his Equifax and Experian credit reports. That was the start of an ordeal consumer advocates say is all too common: Rennick\u2019s credit-history information was mixed up with that of another man.\n\nThe files stated that Rennick was dead, according to the broker. Equifax and Experian, two of the three major credit-reporting agencies gathering data on a person\u2019s creditworthiness, had somehow blended his credit history with an unrelated James Palmer, Rennick\u2019s 2017 lawsuit said.\n\nRennick was in desperate need of money to help his ailing wife, with an incorrect credit report standing in his way, his lawsuit alleged. Rennick, 70, passed away in May 2018 with his lawsuit pending.\n\n\u201cHe died of a broken heart,\u201d his daughter Michele Malverty said in a deposition last September.\n\nRennick and his wife were both cremated because there wasn\u2019t enough money for the more expensive option of burial, court papers said.\n\nMalverty is preparing for an November trial against Equifax in a Tampa, Fla. federal court.\n\n(An Equifax spokesman said the company would not comment on pending litigation. TransUnion and Experian also did not respond to request for comment.)\n\nThe other James \u2014 James Palmer \u2014 resided in Granville, N.Y. and died in 2016 at age 71. The two men shared the same first name, but as the case progressed Malverty would discover that, due to a series of alleged missteps by the companies involved, they shared more than that.\n\nA severe example of an ongoing problem\n\nThis was not the only case of its kind. Four years ago, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion reached settlements with more than 30 attorneys general. Among other systemic changes, the 2015 pacts required the bureaus to share information about confirmed \u201cmixed files\u201d and develop best practices to avoid saying a living consumer was dead.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a culture there that they are more concerned about the satisfaction of the creditors and debt collectors rather than getting things rights.\u2019 \u2014Chi Chi Wu, National Consumer Law Center staff attorney\n\nThe Rennick case suggests changes are slow at the \u201cBig Three,\u201d said Chi Chi Wu, a National Consumer Law Center staff attorney. \u201cThere\u2019s a culture there that they are more concerned about the satisfaction of the creditors and debt collectors rather than getting things rights,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier this year, she wrote a report saying the three credit bureaus use \u201coverly loose matching criteria\u201d when they put debt collector and creditor information on a person\u2019s file.\n\nOne quarter of the 329,800 complaints the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received last year pertained to Equifax EFX, +0.15%, Experian EXPGY, -0.24% and TransUnion TRU, -1.81%. Some 83% of those complaints were related to incorrect information on file \u2014 which could include a mixed file among other things \u2014 or a problem with an investigation of a dispute.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to say specifically how often mixed files happen.\n\nEquifax\u2019s expert witness at a separate 2013 trial said mixed files may occur in 1% to 2% of all files. Given that the CFPB estimates that 208 million Americans have records with at least one of the three major credit bureaus, those percentages \u2014 if extrapolated for all three bureaus \u2014 could mean that up to 2 million people have someone else\u2019s information in their file.\n\nWu said even 1% is a lot. \u201cThis is a consumer\u2019s financial reputation.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, consumers are able to get errors fixed promptly. Experian fixed Rennick\u2019s snafu after the first dispute, his lawyer said. Experian settled Rennick\u2019s lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, court papers show.\n\n\u2018This is a consumer\u2019s financial reputation.\u2019 \u2014Chi Chi Wu, National Consumer Law Center staff attorney\n\nBut it\u2019s been a different story with Equifax.\n\nRennick sent a Social Security Administration letter to Equifax, vouching for him. He went back to the broker hoping that would fix the problem. Yet Rennick\u2019s report said he was behind on mortgage payments, the broker said. Rennick obtained a letter from the lender saying the mortgage in question wasn\u2019t his.\n\nIn court papers, Equifax said it removed a \u201cdeceased\u201d notation during Rennick\u2019s first phone dispute.\n\nHowever, Angela, 68, died before Rennick could disentangle the reports and get a loan. She died in June 2017 and Rennick sued a month later.\n\nAfter Angela\u2019s death, the partially paralyzed Rennick got a Kia so his daughter could drive him around. The bank repossessed the vehicle because, according to court papers, Rennick\u2019s credit report stated said he was deceased, according to his lawyer. For its part, Equifax said it had already removed the \u201cdeceased\u201d notation.\n\nA jury will decide the case now\n\nThe credit bureau violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Malverty\u2019s lawsuit contends. When consumer reporting agencies offer information on someone\u2019s creditworthiness, the law states they must \u201cfollow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information.\u201d\n\nDaniel Zemel, the Clifton, N.J. attorney representing Malverty, has filed about 200 cases annually against credit-reporting bureaus for alleged credit-reporting violations. He has had five cases related to mixed files, he said. \u201cThe injury here is worse than any other case I ever had,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cNone of them are as extreme as this case.\u201d\n\nEquifax says it \u2018dutifully conducted an investigation each and every time Rennick made a dispute.\u2019\n\nThe Rennicks were Catholic and burial was the family custom, he said. Angela was scared of fire, stemming from a childhood burn on her face, Zemel noted.\n\nThough creditors supplied incorrect information, Equifax said it didn\u2019t break the Fair Credit Reporting Act in how it handled Rennick\u2019s dispute. The company said in court filings it didn\u2019t act with malice and, in fact, \u201cdutifully conducted an investigation each and every time Rennick made a dispute.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s no guarantee Rennick would have secured the money, Equifax argues. It noted Rennick didn\u2019t have the title to the house. But Zemel said the Rennicks could have easily obtained the title as they applied for the loan.\n\nSo how did the two files become mixed up?\n\nJames Rennick, of Spring Hill, Fla., and James Palmer of Granville, N.Y., never met, but they had two important things in common: The same first name and the same sequence in eight digits of their nine-digit Social Security numbers.\n\nThe similarities between the two numbers \u201cwould not, under Equifax\u2019s procedures, cause the Rennick and Palmer files to mix,\u201d the credit bureau said in court papers.\n\nJames Rennick, of Spring Hill, Fla., and James Palmer of Granville, N.Y., never met, but it would turn out that they had two important things in common.\n\nBut Equifax said a mortgage lender in 2006 listed Palmer\u2019s Social Security number for a mortgage that Rennick owned. The lender later updated the report with Rennick\u2019s correct number and transferred it to another lender. Those updates made the two files combine in 2008.\n\n\u201cFrom that time until Rennick\u2019s disputes to Equifax, accounts for both Rennick and Palmer appeared in a single, shared file,\u201d Equifax said in a court filing.\n\nWhile the Rennick case prepares for trial, Palmer\u2019s surviving wife also has a pending lawsuit against Equifax in New York State federal court. She alleges the couple had difficulties obtaining credit and a repossessed car because of the mix-up. Equifax denies liability and is fighting the case.\n\nMixed-filed cases may be infrequent compared to other credit-report issues, but they can be the toughest to correct \u2014 especially without litigation,\u201d said consumer lawyer Penny Hays Cauley of Florence, S.C. Mixed file cases account for around 10% of her cases on credit-reporting problems.\n\nOnce incorrect data gets in the system, fixing credit reports can be like operating in an \u2018echo chamber.\u2019 \u2014Justin Baxter of Baxter & Baxter\n\nMixed files are difficult to fix because once bad data enters the computerized credit-information systems, it can be tough to erase, said Justin Baxter, a lawyer with Baxter & Baxter in Portland, Ore. \u201cIt\u2019s just an echo chamber,\u201d he said.\n\nCauley represented a woman whose credit information was mixed with someone with a bad credit history. It was especially worrisome because her client was married to a man with top secret security clearance, Cauley explained.\n\nThe man\u2019s employer often checked its workers and their relatives\u2019 backgrounds for troubling signs, she added. \u201cIt just created this level of stress for the family,\u201d said Cauley, noting the case resulted in a 2014 confidential settlement.\n\nIn 2013, Baxter won an $18.6 million jury verdict against Equifax for a client named Julie Miller whose information merged with a different Julie Miller. Miller filed multiple disputes with Equifax over two years, to no avail. Appellate judges cut Miller\u2019s award to $1.62 million in damages and $300,000 in legal fees, Baxter said.\n\nMeanwhile, as Malverty\u2019s trial date nears, both sides are fighting over what information can be admitted into the courtroom.\n\nEquifax\u2019s lawyers say jurors shouldn\u2019t hear about the Rennicks seeking the money for home improvement, or that they were both cremated. Hearing both matters could unfairly turn the jury against the credit bureau, they say.\n\nZemel did not make Malverty available for an interview.\n\nBut in her September 2018 deposition, Malverty said the mix-up files wrecked her and her family. \u201cI\u2019m tormented every day,\u201d she said at the time. One memory was finding her father talking to her mother\u2019s urn, saying \u201c\u2019Ang, I\u2019m sorry I let you down.\u2019\u201d", "description": "James Rennick was in desperate need of money to help his ailing wife, but an incorrect credit report stood in his way, this lawsuit alleges.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU000_Equifa_ZG_20191024223841.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
