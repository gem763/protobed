Logano\u2019s spin brought out a caution that helped keep the Team Penske driver on the lead lap instead of losing two laps if he had limped into the pits under green to change tires.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind he spun his car intentionally and finally in a place when he realized he had a problem, and he was going to need a caution because they were going to go a couple laps down if they had to pit under green and make this change,\u201d Jarrett said on this week\u2019s postrace playoff edition of the NASCAR on NBC Podcast with Nate Ryan.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter contact with Hamlin that squeezed him into the wall and left his left-rear tire flat, Logano nearly lost control of his No. 22 Ford in Turn 4.\n\nAfter traveling down the frontstretch on Lap 458, the car looped in the outside lane of Turn 1 without hitting the wall or another car. That brought out a caution that allowed Logano to pit for four tires.\n\nLogano essentially forced NASCAR to decide if his action was intentional, Jarrett said. As it turned out, NASCAR did not penalize Logano. Officials told NBC Sports that the incident wasn\u2019t reviewed by the scoring tower.\n\nAccording to ground rules provided to Cup crew chief, NASCAR officials can penalize at their discretion if they determine a driver intentionally caused a caution. There also have been postrace penalties in the past after NASCAR determined that drivers spun intentionally to cause a yellow.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhy not put the ball in NASCAR\u2019s court to try to decide?\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s a ball and strike call. I\u2019ll take it even further than that: Did the pitcher intentionally hit a batter? There\u2019s only one person that really knows for sure if that\u2019s the case. And in this case, there\u2019s only one person that knows 100 percent.\n\n\u201cI think I know as a driver and competitor in that situation that I\u2019d rather take my chances on NASCAR having to make that call and said I created a caution intentionally. I think that\u2019s a one-lap penalty if you do that. That\u2019s less than what they were going to lose if they went in under green and change tires.\n\n\u201cWhy not put (NASCAR) in that position? They might not make that call. It might look like (Logano) was carrying too much speed and just spun.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that he did the thing that most of us \u2013 most of as drivers \u2013 would have done in that situation. I don\u2019t fault him at all. It\u2019s no different than a crew chief pushing the limits of what he can get through inspection. A driver is doing the same thing. And in this case, I think he\u2019s going to come out with a better end, whichever way the call went there.\u201d\n\nLogano salvaged an eighth-place finish at Martinsville that kept him in the final transfer spot for the playoffs, 14 points above the cutline. If he had pitted under green with 40 laps remaining, he likely would have finished outside the top 20.\n\n\u201cNow those guys that are below the cutline kind of wish that would have played out that way so that everybody\u2019d be a lot closer to that cut line,\u201d Jarrett said.\n\nNoting how hard Logano raced at Dover while 24 laps down because every playoff point matters, Jarrett said Logano and crew chief Todd Gordon have skillfully maximized points while minimizing potentially negative outcomes for the No. 22 during the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThis is four races in a row for Joey Logano and his team to make something of literally a disaster for them,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t make that much at Dover once they had that problem, but the other two races in the Round of 12, they came back and made something after getting crashed at Talladega and here again (at Martinsville), having another problem that could have put them outside the top four here, but they came back and saved that.\n\n\u201cHe was able to keep his wits about him \u2013 which is hard to do for a driver \u2013 and drive up through the field and get something of it.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the NASCAR on NBC Podcast via the embed above or on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher and Google Play.
