As the faster network standard is quickly and broadly deployed, carriers say 5G will result in a \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d that will change absolutely everything, resulting in smart cities and even smarter cancer cures.\n\n\n\nIn reality, carriers have faced widespread criticism for overhyping not only what 5G can do, but where it\u2019s actually available. Verizon\u2019s early 5G launches have been criticized for being fast but barely available. AT&T has been ridiculed for overstating 5G availability by using bogus 5G phone icons. And while 5G coverage will improve over time, it will take many years to do so.\n\n\n\nBecause it's been so overhyped, having an accurate map of actual 5G availability is going to be important.\n\nBut for years, both industry and government broadband availability maps have been criticized for massively overstating real world broadband availability. Carriers have historically lobbied against better broadband mapping, worried that better public data would only highlight America\u2019s significant broadband and competition shortcomings.\n\n\n\nWhile political pressure is forcing the government to at least take a deeper look at the mapping problem, wireless carriers clearly don\u2019t want 5G included in those efforts. In a filing with the government first spotted by Light Reading, AT&T tells the FCC disclosing 5G availability data could reveal \u201csensitive information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"It would be premature for the Commission to require wireless providers to submit coverage maps for 5G service at this time,\" AT&T said, stating that \"requiring 5G coverage maps in this early stage of 5G deployment could reveal sensitive information about cell site locations and even customer locations.\"\n\n\n\nThe CTIA, the wireless industry\u2019s top lobbying organization, mirrored those claims in its own filing, insisting that while the organization \u201csupports efforts to monitor 5G deployment,\u201d it is \u201cpremature to propose standardized service requirements\u201d for mapping 5G availability.\n\n\n\nCarriers were responding to a recent FCC proposal that would use more accurate geospatial data to pinpoint broadband availability. Historically, the FCC declared an area \u201cserved\u201d with broadband if just one home in a census tract had service. The FCC\u2019s $350 million broadband map showcases how this results in a comical overstating of broadband speed and availability.\n\nIndustry watchers say the wireless industry\u2019s opposition has less to do with exposing sensitive data, and more to do with not wanting the industry\u2019s shaky 5G marketing claims exposed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real reason is because 5G will be basically nowhere in a year from now,\u201d Ernesto Falcon, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Motherboard. \u201cMost estimates I've seen is barely 10 percent of Americans will have access to 5G in three years from now,\u201d he said, pointing to wireless availability predictions from Cisco.\n\n\n\nFalcon said that while faster wireless is certainly a good thing, 5G still relies on fiber optic lines that feed cellular towers. These are the same fiber optic lines AT&T and Verizon stopped deploying to less affluent areas several years ago despite billions in subsidies and tax breaks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe carriers have not figured out how to justify deploying dense fiber networks to support 5G after they willfully abandoned deploying fiber to the home to compete with cable,\u201d Falcon said.\n\n\n\nDana Floberg recently testified before Congress about America's terrible broadband maps and broadband availability on behalf of consumer group Free Press. She also suggested mobile carriers aren\u2019t keen on having their 5G availability claims exposed.\n\n\u201cRight now, 5G is the technological equivalent of the emperor's new clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's the finest new technology, but no one can see it. Without maps that clarify where 5G service is offered at particular service standards, carriers have few checks on their claims about 5G's current reach and capabilities.\u201d\n\nFloberg noted that looming 5G availability has been widely used by the Trump administration to justify the obliteration of industry oversight and consumer protections, making data on where 5G really is all the more important.\n\n\u201cWe've seen policymakers from Chairman Pai to President Trump use the promise of 5G to justify and grandstand about all sorts of anti-public interest policies, including the administration's efforts to kill Net Neutrality\u2014making it even more important that the public has a way to check these 5G claims against reality now,\u201d she said.", "description": "Big Telecom is resisting efforts by the government to require it to include 5G availability in broadband maps.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e2ca3c94537000a157523/lede/1570715957140-ATandT-and-Verizon-Dont-Want-You-To-Know-Where-5G-Really-Is_HF.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
