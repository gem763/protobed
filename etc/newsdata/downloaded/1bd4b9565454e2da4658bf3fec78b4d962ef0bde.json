Many are not just misbehaving, they may have an actual behavioral disorder,\u201d Dr. Howard Taras, Professor of Pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego, and medical consultant to several school districts, said in an interview with ABC News.\n\nWFTV\n\nOne of the children arrested has sleep apnea. According to her grandmother, the girl was acting out as a reaction to poor sleep. Sleep apnea is a known risk factor for behavioral problems, but there were no reports the girl had a behavioral disorder.\n\n\u201cBehavioral disturbances in children are very common,\u201d said Dr. Victor Fornari, Vice Chair for Child & Adolescent Psychiatry at Northwell Health in an interview with ABC News. According to the CDC, 1 in 6 children between age 2 and 8 in the U.S. have a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder.\n\n\u201cChildren with these disorders may be perceived as lazy or willfully oppositional rather than as having neurocognitive deficits,\u201d said doctors Celiane Rey-Casserly, Laura McGuinn, Arthur Lavin in a clinical report for the American Academy of Pediatrics, published last Monday.\n\nKids with behavioral disorders are more likely to be disciplined. \u201cAny child with any kind of difficulty, whether it\u2019s a learning difficulty or fine motor issue, they are more vulnerable as individuals,\u201d says Fornari. \u201cThey could be bullied by peers or victimized by adults. We hope that recognizing them as vulnerable would lead to them being more protected, but often that is not the case.\u201d\n\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Education report, while students with disabilities make up only 12 percent of the enrolled population, they make up 28 percent of the students who are arrested at school or referred to law enforcement, according to data from the 2015-'16 school year.\n\nWFTV\n\nChildren with behavioral disorders can show a range of troubling behavior, including aggression, obstinance and running away. These behaviors are, understandably, challenging for teachers and school staff to address.\n\n\u201cIf the child is consistently acting out during a particular subject, such as math\u201d that can be a sign that further testing is required said Dr. Yi Hui Liu, Section Head of Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nMoreover, \u201cchildren who were successful in the prior year but not in the current year could have a learning issue,\u201d said Liu. She also asks, \u201cIs there a family history of a learning disability? If so, this would increase concern for a learning disability.\u201d\n\nA greater proportion of children living below 100 percent of the federal poverty level have mental, behavioral, or developmental disorders, according to the CDC. Unfortunately, these children often attend underserved schools, and \u201cthe lack of resources in underfunded schools causes disparities in helping children with developmental issues in those areas,\u201d says Cecelia Rhodus, a developmental and behavioral health fellow at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n\u201cIf a child is having a behavioral problem in school, we have to understand why. Where is the problem coming from? We can\u2019t just react to the behavior,\u201d said Liu.\n\nSome specialists said a lack of proper training for school staff may have led to the improper arrest of a child in Orlando. The officer in that case broke departmental policy by not getting supervisor approval to arrest a child under 12, the Orlando police chief said.\n\n\u201cWhen a child is out of control, unless the staff member is trained to de-escalate, the staff member may also become agitated. Then you see what we saw in Orlando with an excessive and punitive response,\u201d said Fornari.\n\nSo how should staff be trained?\n\nA 2013 study asserted that \"early childhood teachers do not receive sufficient training for handling children\u2019s challenging behaviors.\" Training and certification for school resource officers and other law enforcement officers who work in school varies by state.\n\n\u201cIt would be fabulous if teachers and school staff have training on understanding and managing behavioral issues with kids on an individual and group level,\u201d says Liu. \u201cCertainly the group dynamics can make things more difficult in making sure all the kids are cared for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal is to train school resource officers in safe ways to restrain a child without causing excessive harm, said Fornari. \"In addition, we want to equip them with skills to verbally de-escalate a child. Kids respond to kindness and support.\u201d\n\nSejal Parekh, M.D., is a pediatrician in San Diego and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "description": "Reports of two six-year-olds being arrested at school for throwing temper tantrums shocked many late last week.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/child-arrest-2-abc-er-190923-2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
