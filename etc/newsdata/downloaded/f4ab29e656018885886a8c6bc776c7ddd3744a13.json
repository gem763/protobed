The statement came in response to concerns that the Senate could simply refuse to hold a trial.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we could somehow bar the doors and prevent the managers from presenting the articles to the Senate,\u201d stated the memo, which was obtained by HuffPost. \u201cThe rules of impeachment are clear on this point.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also said as much in a March interview with NPR: \u201cIf it [impeachment] were to happen, the Senate has no choice. If the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats have speculated that @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell would not hold a Senate trial if Trump were impeached by the House.\n\n\n\nBut McConnell told @NPREmbedded - definitively and on the record - that if the House impeached, the Senate *would* hold a trial.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd0aLISTEN: pic.twitter.com/kOD1PRUqoK \u2014 Tom Dreisbach (@TomDreisbach) September 27, 2019\n\nMcConnell could call a vote on a motion to dismiss, which would effectively amount to a vote to acquit Trump of wrongdoing.\n\nIt is the job of the House to consider articles of impeachment against a president. If approved, it is then the \u201csole power\u201d of the Senate, according to the Constitution, to hold an impeachment trial that could result in removing a president from office. The Senate held an impeachment trial against Bill Clinton in 1999, and acquitted him.\n\nThe House launched a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday following a whistleblower complaint concerning a July phone call in which Trump repeatedly urged Ukraine\u2019s president to initiate an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden and his son. Trump did so while holding up U.S. military aid to Ukraine.", "description": "\u201cThere is no way we could somehow bar the doors and prevent the managers from presenting the articles\" of impeachment, states the memo.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8fe8fb2200005a00df1520.jpeg?cache=9e3itbqy2j&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
