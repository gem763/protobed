In July, Microsoft reported that Russian and Iranian hackers had carried at least 800 cyberattacks on political organizations.\n\nIn a 30-day period between August and September, Phosphorous made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts belonging to specific Microsoft customers and then attack 241 of those accounts, according to the company.\n\nFour accounts were successfully hacked, but none of them were associated with a presidential campaign, or current or former U.S. official.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we all \u2014 governments and private sector \u2014 are increasingly transparent about nation-state attacks and efforts to disrupt democratic processes,\u201d said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee sent an email advisory to Democratic presidential campaigns informing them about Microsoft\u2019s discovery.\n\nThe hackers have been \u201cattacking personal as well as official work accounts,\u201d according to a copy of the message obtained by POLITICO. \u201cThey create believable spear phishing emails and fake LinkedIn profiles as primary tactics.\u201d\n\nThe committee stressed that Microsoft had witnessed the group circumvent two-factor authentication in some instances. The DNC also urged campaigns to review the security checklist it issued earlier this year.\n\nIn a statement, DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency chief Chris Krebs said the organization is aware of Microsoft\u2019s findings and is \u201cworking with them to assess and mitigate impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile much of this activity can likely be attributed to run-of-the-mill foreign intelligence work, Microsoft's claims that a presidential campaign was targeted is yet more evidence that our adversaries are looking to undermine our democratic institutions,\u201d he added.\n\nProtecting the 2020 election \u201cwill require government and industry working together, taking collaborative, tangible actions to push back on the threats we face,\u201d according to Krebs.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/43/a2/4aa7209b48b48eaa4cf7013aed54/19104-microsoft-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
