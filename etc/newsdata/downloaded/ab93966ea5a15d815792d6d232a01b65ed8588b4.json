In an interview with Empire magazine earlier this month, Scorsese likened Marvel films, which this year included Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel, to \"theme parks\", saying they were \"not cinema\".\n\nOn October 20, The Godfather director, who was in Lyon, France to receive the Prix Lumiere for his contributions to cinema, added to the debate while speaking at a press conference: \"When Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right, because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration. I don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again. Martin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\"\n\nThere has been a backlash to both Scorsese's and Coppola's comments, with Doctor Strange screenwriter C. Robert Cargill tweeting \"anyone who thinks Marvel is only trying to make theme park rides is being unjust and cynical.\"\n\nCoppola's most recent films Youth Without Youth and Twixt grossed just $2.6 million and $1.3 million (respectively) at the US box office, while Captain Marvel grossed over $1 billion, and Avengers: Endgame almost $3 billion.", "description": "Francis Ford Coppola has joined Martin Scorsese's attack on Marvel films.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Julie Burchill"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2019/10/21/marvel-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqY4-XNG_7v-V2jIZ3ghNYKOzp_q1NNzb1pgulLIjZVAI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
