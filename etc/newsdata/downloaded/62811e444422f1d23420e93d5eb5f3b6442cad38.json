He took charge in Oct. 2004, five months after they won the La Liga title and the UEFA Cup, and resigned for health reasons two months before they won the Copa del Rey in 2008.\n\nDuring his presidency, the club began constructing the Nuevo Mestalla stadium but building was halted less than two years later for financial reasons due to Spain\u2019s deep economic crisis.", "description": "Former Valencia president Juan Soler was sentenced on Tuesday to two years in prison for conspiring to kidnap a former colleague and break into his home, a regional court said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
