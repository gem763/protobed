He recommended abstaining from taking long-term trading positions right now.", "description": "Capital Wealth Planning's Jeffrey Saut is on market pullback watch.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105984704-1561385680320sixflags.jpg?v=1571856165", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
