It\u2019s also easy to buy a DualShock 4 or Xbox One gamepad, then pair it to your phone via Bluetooth so you can have a console-like controller experience without being glued to your couch.\n\nBoth of those points make it very hard for me to convince anyone to buy the Asus ROG Phone II, an $899 gaming-focused phone that has its own ecosystem of pricey proprietary accessories. The accessories were made for the phone, and the phone was made for these accessories, for better and worse.\n\nOur review of Asus ROG Phone 2 Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Incredibly powerful\n\nHuge, gorgeous OLED 120Hz refresh rate display\n\nMultiple USB-C ports Bad Stuff It\u2019s huge, heavy, and unattractive\n\nThe cameras aren\u2019t great\n\nIt should include a few more accessories by default Buy for $899.00 from Amazon Buy for $899.99 from B&H\n\nIt costs a lot of money to unlock the potential of this phone, but there are quite a few things that I like about the device on its own. It has three USB-C ports: one on its bottom and two joined together along its side. Two of them can be used to charge the phone, while the other is exclusively for Asus\u2019 accessories, and it\u2019s marked orange to indicate that. It\u2019s thoughtful of Asus, especially since this is primarily a gaming phone, to mount a USB-C charge port in a place that won\u2019t distract you while you\u2019re playing games in landscape mode.\n\nThe ROG Phone II is one of the most powerful phones that you can buy, and it\u2019s easy to see the results of this hardware in action. There\u2019s absolutely no slowdown while using apps and games, and switching between them is nearly instantaneous. A few things inside of the phone contribute to that: the Snapdragon 855 Plus processor that was created to be faster and more efficient during gaming, the speedy UFS 3.0 storage, and its 12GB of RAM.\n\nEverything looks fantastic on the ROG Phone II\u2019s large 6.6-inch 1080 x 2340 HDR OLED screen. It has a 120Hz refresh rate, which allows for smooth in-motion visuals and seamless scrolling. This is a technology that I think is essential for gaming, whether you\u2019re doing it on a phone or a PC. Each time I went back to using my personal Pixel 3, I missed looking at the ROG Phone II.\n\nAsus ROG Phone II specs Screen: 6.59 inches (1080 x 2340) OLED, with 120Hz refresh rate option Dimensions: 170.99 x 77.6 x 9.48mm Weight: 240 grams OS: Android 9 Pie Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus RAM: 12GB LPDDR4X Storage: 512GB UFS 3.0 storage (configurations available with 1TB) Battery capacity: 6,000mAh Front camera: 24MP, f/2.0 Rear cameras: 48MP standard sensor (f/1.79, PDAF), 13MP ultra-wide angle (f/2.4)\n\nThis phone\u2019s 120Hz refresh rate display is fun to use, but it\u2019s only as good as the content that supports it. Thankfully, there are plenty of games from the Google Play Store that are optimized to run at up to 120 frames per second. A few popular examples include Alto\u2019s Odyssey (and its predecessor, Alto\u2019s Adventure), Don\u2019t Starve, DOTA Underlords, Minecraft, and Rayman Adventures. Asus seems to be adding more titles and compiling them on its site.\n\nLastly, I love the AirTriggers feature. While you\u2019re in game in landscape mode, there are two touch-sensitive areas near the power and volume buttons that act like triggers on a controller. This feature can be switched on through Asus\u2019 Armoury Crate app, its console-like dashboard that comes preinstalled on the phone.\n\nOnce you activate it, you pick a place on the screen where each AirTrigger will virtually tap on a per-game basis. This allows you to designate a button to one of these triggers, so you don\u2019t need to reach to press an annoying-to-reach on-screen button. I didn\u2019t think alternative phone controls could get any more creative than the Black Shark 2\u2019s MagicTouch feature, but this outdoes it handily.\n\nThe accessory breakdown\n\nThe phone comes with a thin case as well as the AeroActive Cooler 2 detailed below. There are seven additional accessories that you can buy separately. If you buy every accessory made for the ROG Phone II, it will cost you $1,996.97, including the cost of the $899 phone. Let\u2019s run through them, what they do, and how much they cost.\n\nThe Lightning Armor is a case that snaps onto the phone, tags up with it via NFC, then activates a theme on the display as well as colorful LED that shoot an array of light through the case. It\u2019s $59. And since other case makers probably won\u2019t be making ROG Phone II cases, your options are limited and, apparently, pretty costly.\n\nThe Kunai GamePad essentially turns the ROG Phone II into a Nintendo Switch-like portable console. This accessory kit includes a case that connects to the phone via USB-C, allowing you to slide on some Joy-Con-like controllers. Asus really isn\u2019t being subtle here with building off of its influences. Alternatively, you can insert the controllers into a controller grip, a la Joy-Con grip, that\u2019s in the box. This is $149.\n\nThe TwinView Dock II is the holy grail of accessories for the ROG Phone II, and possibly for any phone. It turns the phone into a dual-screened clamshell device, almost like a Nintendo 3DS, but with a second 120Hz OLED display, 5,000mAh of battery, and extra cooling power by way of some small fans on its underside. The phone latches into the bottom section of the dock, plugging in with its two, side-mounted USB-C ports. And because the power and volume buttons on the phone are inaccessible while it\u2019s docked, Asus cleverly built the buttons near the second display. This accessory lets you, say, watch YouTube videos while you play a game on the other screen. It\u2019s $329.99 and probably my favorite of the accessories that are available. However, it\u2019s also bulky, and the build quality isn\u2019t great.\n\nAsus makes a mobile desktop dock that allows you to connect the phone to a bigger display via HDMI or DisplayPort. As far what the dock supports, it can connect to a 4K screen with up to a 60Hz refresh rate. It also has four USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports for a mouse or keyboard, an Ethernet port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Asus\u2019 Game Genie software lets you map the controls in any game, and aside from the phone\u2019s display not rendering correctly on the monitor I tested this on, I was surprised by how much this felt like gaming on a competent PC \u2014 without my collection of PC games, of course. This costs an extra $229.99. But during my testing, a standard USB-C hub worked fine for plugging it into a monitor or TV. However, the phone seems to output video only through its side-mounted USB-C port. (The orange one next to it is exclusively used for Asus\u2019 accessories.)\n\nThe AeroActive Cooler 2 is a fan attachment that connects into two of the phone\u2019s USB-C ports and hosts one USB-C port and a 3.5mm jack you can use when it\u2019s in landscape mode. Asus claims that this fan keeps the phone up to 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler. It\u2019s included with the phone at no extra cost.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a WiGig display dock that lets you wirelessly beam what\u2019s on your phone\u2019s screen over to the big screen. It operates via Qualcomm\u2019s 60GHz Wi-Fi band, and it is simple to set up and, as I expected, it\u2019s incredibly fast when you\u2019re standing in range. I didn\u2019t notice much in the way of latency between me touching the ROG Phone II\u2019s display and seeing it happen on my TV. If all you want to do is put your phone\u2019s screen on your TV, a Google Chromecast might suffice. It can\u2019t compete with the WiGig when it comes to low latency and visual quality, but it\u2019s $300 cheaper.\n\nThe ROG Phone II is a powerhouse when it comes to performance. I detailed above that several games support its 120Hz refresh rate display, and, as I expected, this Asus phone has no issue running anything without the slightest hint of a slowdown. PUBG Mobile runs flawlessly with all of the graphical settings pushed to their limits (though, unfortunately, this title is locked at 60Hz).\n\nAgree to Continue: Asus ROG Phone II Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. Before you even get to the agreements, Asus requires you to acknowledge that you won\u2019t insert a Type-C cable into the orange-colored USB-C port on the side of this phone. It won\u2019t let you proceed with setup until you hit \u201cNext\u201d If you\u2019re above the age of 16, you can consent to Asus collecting anonymous information from the device (that it says won\u2019t characterize or identify you). But whether you\u2019re younger than 16 years old or not, you can proceed by hitting \u201cdisagree\u201d so it\u2019s totally optional. To take advantage of all of the features on this phone, you\u2019ll need to sign in with your Google account. By doing that, you agree to three things: Google\u2019s terms of service\n\nGoogle Play terms of service\n\nGoogle\u2019s privacy policy Final tally: four mandatory agreements (one from Asus, three from Google) and one optional agreement from Asus\n\nOther demanding titles, like Dead Trigger 2 and Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition also ran beautifully \u2014 especially so thanks to their support for its 120Hz refresh rate display. From a technical standpoint, this phone should have no problem keeping up with advancements in mobile graphics for some time.\n\nAsus\u2019 focus for this device is obviously on gaming, but I also ran through the paces of how it fares with regular phone stuff. The look and feel of the software can be switched between Zen UI, which is close in its look and feel to stock Android 9 Pie and Asus\u2019 ROG UI. There aren\u2019t many functional differences to speak of, but if you\u2019re a fan of the edgy gaming hardware aesthetic found on my gaming PC accessories (which also happens to be what the ROG Phone II looks like), the ROG-themed option will likely suit you. It swaps the bright, sunny Zen UI theme, and all of its app icons, out for a darker, aggressive styling.\n\nIf you have deep pockets (both to fit the phone and to afford it), the ROG Phone II may fit into your pants pocket, but it probably won\u2019t be too comfortable. This phone is a large presence, whether it\u2019s in your pocket or your hands. (I say \u201chands\u201d because, for most people, it will require two to hold and operate it.) It\u2019s both large and heavy, weighing 240 grams, which is about 16 grams heavier than the already-beefy iPhone 11 Pro Max. Asus at least justifies its weighty build with a 6,000mAh battery. This phone routinely lasts two to three days with mixed use, even with the display set to 120Hz refresh rate. Granted, the results were usually less impressive if I played more games than usual. But considering all the power inside of this phone, it lasts for a surprisingly long time.\n\nSomething that I was worried about, at least at first, was its optical in-display fingerprint sensor. Our experience with both ultrasonic and optical, so far, has translated to slower, more error-prone authentication than the dedicated fingerprint sensors located on a phone\u2019s side or back. But surprisingly, this one is easy and fast to use.\n\nThe ROG Phone II is capable of a lot, generally speaking, but its cameras are its weakest point. It has a dual-lens camera system on its back, comprised of a 48MP main lens and a 13MP 125-degree wide angle lens. The same Sony IMX586 image sensor that we saw in the Asus ZenFone 6 makes another appearance here. It puts out image quality that I think is better than passable in both day and night shots, but it doesn\u2019t meet my expectations for a phone that costs $899.\n\nThese results are more palatable in the cheaper ZenFone 6, and, apparently, the Honor View 20\u2019s \u201cAI Ultra Clarity\u201d mode squeezes even more out of this sensor, coming close to rivaling the iPhone XS Max in a shootout. But again, this phone wasn\u2019t made for taking photos, so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything phenomenal.\n\nWhether the ROG Phone II is a fit for you doesn\u2019t rest on you being a gamer who\u2019s looking for the right kind of phone. If all that you want is an Android phone with a fast-refreshing display and capable specs, the new OnePlus 7T will likely suit most, if not all, of your needs for a lot less money. As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s possible that your current phone might be powerful enough to handle most games already, and if it\u2019s an iPhone with iOS 13 installed, it has native support for PS4 and Xbox One controllers.\n\nAsus\u2019 ambitious gaming phone offers a lot of power for $899, and thanks to its accessories, it\u2019s capable of more than almost any other phone out there. There\u2019s an audience for this kind of package, but for most people, it probably comes with too many compromises. It\u2019s big, heavy, and you\u2019ll need to spend hundreds to see some of that potential as a portable gaming console come to fruition.", "description": "The Asus ROG Phone II is the ultimate gaming phone.
