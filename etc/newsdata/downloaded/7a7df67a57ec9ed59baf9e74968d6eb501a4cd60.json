You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever, the results suggest food preferences have changed and the days of beers and burgers are long gone. Instead respondents said they opted instead to tuck into Thali, fish curry, kimchee and, for one in 20 respondents, insects.\n\nEighty percent said they would buy unique products which cannot be found elsewhere, with nearly half preferring to shop at music festivals rather than online or on the high street, feeling more connected to products bought at a live event.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
