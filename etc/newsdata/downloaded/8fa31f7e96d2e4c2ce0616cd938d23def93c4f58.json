Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) on Friday, alleging the congresswoman was being groomed by Russia to be a third-party candidate in 2020.\n\nThe failed 2016 Democrat nominee, who has accused President Donald Trump of being Russia\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d in the past, made the remarks during an interview on David Plouffe\u2019s Campaign HQ podcast, while discussing Russian interference. Clinton suggested during the exchange that Russian President Vladimir Putin was grooming a stalking horse candidate to ensure Trump would be reelected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians.\u201d\n\nClinton also added she believed Jill Stein, the likely Green Party nominee for president, is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\n\"I'm not making any predictions but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.

Instead, many have attempted to smear Gabbard as both an \u201cextremist\u201d and \u201capologist\u201d for dictators, the latter resulting in her refusal to condemn Syria\u2019s strongman Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn particular, the New York Times ran a piece on the congresswoman earlier this week, painting her as a right wing extremist.\n\n\u201cThen there is 4chan, the notoriously toxic online message board, where some right-wing trolls and anti-Semites fawn over Ms. Gabbard, calling her \u2018Mommy\u2019 and praising her willingness to criticize Israel,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cIn April, the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, took credit for Ms. Gabbard\u2019s qualification for the first two Democratic primary debates.\u201d\n\nGabbard addressed such smears as \u201ccompletely despicable\u201d during the Democrat presidential primary debate on Tuesday in Ohio.", "description": "Hillary Clinton took a veiled shot at Tulsi Gabbard, alleging the congresswoman was being groomed by Russia run third-party in 2020.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hillary-clinton-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
