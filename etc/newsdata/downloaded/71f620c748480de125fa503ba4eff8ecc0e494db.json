Our expert guide to improving your chances", "language": "en", "text": "If you wanted to design a system solely to bring out the conniving, anxious worst of the country\u2019s most bookish teens, that system would be the Oxbridge admissions process. Armed with their AS levels or equivalent, the students currently undergoing this process must now prepare their application for either Oxford or Cambridge.\n\nThe first thing to know about this stage is that you can\u2019t pick both. Between them, Oxford and Cambridge have existed for 17 centuries, and they\u2019re not going to let you, an applicant who has existed for 17 years, play them off against each other.\n\nSo you\u2019ll have to choose between them, which sometimes depends on which course you\u2019re doing, and at the same time you\u2019ll have to choose a college. There are vast colleges, cramped colleges, rich colleges, poor colleges, sporty colleges, studious colleges, beautiful colleges, ugly colleges, colleges which claim to no longer be posh, colleges which claim to be the friendliest or most fun or most supportive. 54 of them take undergraduates, and that\u2019s not even counting Oxford\u2019s six permanent private halls, which are smaller but similar.\n\nThe Telegraph has attempted to make as useful a comparison as possible between the colleges, ranking them on financial assets, academic performance, lifestyle and accommodation as part of our guide to applying to Oxford or Cambridge universities. Start here, and use the guide to work out which colleges offer the subjects you\u2019re interested in, and which of those colleges best suit your priorities.", "description": "If you wanted to design a system solely to bring out the conniving, anxious worst of the country\u2019s most bookish teens, that system would be the Oxbridge admissions process.", "authors": ["Tom Ough", "James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000202888429-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVfKYF8F8biotmZZgOU3KX0YMapKPjdhyLnv9ax6_too.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
