Two of them are ginger, so they have that fair skin that gets all red and blotchy, and I think it\u2019s nice to look a bit smoother. And not look back and think, \u2018Oh, my poor face!\u2019\"\n\nZissman defended her decision by adding she would never Photoshop her children\u2019s permanent features and that they are unaware their images have been edited.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s on the wall I like it to look nice, I\u2019ve got a very nice house. I want them to fit the brand of the house,\u201d Zissman explained.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know, they just think they\u2019re beautiful always, Photoshop or not.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t Photoshop out a scar, or something like that because I wouldn\u2019t want them to be ashamed of anything like that, but for me, there\u2019s a line.\u201d\n\nThe mother-of-three also said she would never use an Instagram filter on any pictures of her daughters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t put my kids on social media either. I\u2019m not one of those mums who has a filter on them which I think is worse,\u201d Zissman continued.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s a line to it, but for a school photo that you look back on, I think girls especially \u2013 and I\u2019m really conscious raising three girls \u2013 sometimes a little ego boost, sometimes it\u2019s okay not to like things about yourself.\u201d\n\nHowever, author Dawn O\u2019Porter \u2013 who has two sons with comedia Chris O\u2019Dowd \u2013 argued that Zissman\u2019s decision to airbrush images of her children could be \u201cinstilling a bad feeling\u201d in them.\n\n\u201cBad school photos are a rite of passage, I love laughing about mine. They\u2019re so cheesy, they\u2019re so blotchy, they\u2019re so terrible,\u201d O\u2019Porter said.\n\n\u201cI would just be worried about that future conversation of, \u201cdidn\u2019t you think I was good enough? I was a child and you didn\u2019t think I was cute. Let\u2019s not instill that feeling.\u201d\n\nViewers at home were divided over the debate, with many criticising Zissman for her comments\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless, your children are beautiful, they\u2019re your world,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNo wonder there is no self-love with toxic damaged parents like that.\u201d\n\nAnother agreed, adding: \u201cWhat message is this sending to children? they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about what they look like.\u201d\n\nHowever, many others defended the reality TV star and praised her for being so honest.\n\n\u201cThe honesty is real @TheLuluLife absolutely love her,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAnother added: \u201cRaising two princesses myself I completely get everything you said on #GMB you came across really well and I totally got everything you said.\u201d\n\nThe debate arose after Sam Walker, a British broadcaster who moved from Manchester to Arizona, US, five months ago, revealed that her children\u2019s school gave her the option to have their school photograph\u2019s airbrushed.\n\nSharing a photograph of the form she received from the school on Twitter, Walker wrote: \u201cThe girls have their school photo today and there is the option to AIRBRUSH the picture!\n\n\u201cThere are two levels offered!! What the....?! Have complained! What 8 yr old needs to be paranoid about an \u201cuneven skin tone\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s tweet quickly went viral online, amassing more than 13,000 likes and hundreds of comments from shocked social media users.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely horrific\u201d one person commented.\n\nAnother added: \u201cThat is genuinely shocking ... I mean seriously. With the mental health crisis kids are facing: they don\u2019t need this kind of message.\"", "description": "Luisa Zissman has defended Photoshopping photographs of her children during a debate about retouching school portraits.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Zissman appeared on Good Morning Britain to discuss the news that a school in the US offered parents the choice to retouch their children\u2019s portraits.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/10/luisa-zissman-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
