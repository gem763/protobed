But a witness said he \u201cwas lucky to walk away\u201d.\n\nFlintoff, 41, was reportedly driving a specialised three-wheel vehicle that can reach high speeds when he veered off the runway. Medics rushed over to the former England cricketer, however the sportsman had escaped unscathed.\n\nFlintoff said \"I'm absolutely fine and was back filming today. I go to great lengths to make sure I do well in Top Gear drag races but on this occasion I went a few lengths too far.\n\n\"It will look more ridiculous than dangerous when you see it on TV\".", "description": "Top Gear presenter Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff walked away from a 124\u2009mph crash at Elvington Airfield on Tuesday - the same location where former presenter Richard Hammond almost died.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/12/TELEMMGLPICT000209247162-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqtR1WRZ4lb6BOb1-FBRpn-lFGGjcI28awSNtOPAVs6pc.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
