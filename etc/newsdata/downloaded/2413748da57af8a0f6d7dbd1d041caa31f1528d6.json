Joe Marler (England) Not so long ago the loosehead was in international retirement, yet now he finds himself as one of just five players to have started all three of England\u2019s pool games. Marler stood up to take on responsibility in the absence of first-choice Mako Vunipola, and ensured that his absence did not become a weakness. AFP via Getty Images 3/16 2. Shota Horie (Japan) Arguably the player of the pool stage. Horie\u2019s familiar locks have made him famous for more than just his rugby skills, but it is what he is doing on the field that he deserves praise for. Standout performances against Ireland and Scotland tell you all you need to know about his form so far. Getty Images 4/16 3. Tadhg Furlong (Ireland) Furlong was outstanding against Samoa and has provided strong consistency across the pool stage to help Ireland get back on their feet. With most tighthead props being rotated game by game, it makes selection rather tricky to look for standout moments, but Furlong\u2019s two crunching runs in his most recent outing see him stand out from the rest. EPA 5/16 4. Luke Thompson (Japan) The 38-year-old is defying Father Time at this year\u2019s World Cup and has been one of their standout players so far. His defensive effort has been supreme with the numbers to back it up, while he is also a key reason why Japan now have a strong set-piece. AFP/Getty Images 6/16 5. Lood de Jager (South Africa) Has stood out from the shadow of Eben Etzebeth to be South Africa\u2019s leading second row so far this tournament. Finally looks to be delivering on the potential that he\u2019s been earmarked as having for some time, and is learning how to make the most of his towering frame. PA 7/16 6. Michael Leitch (Japan) Captain fantastic and a hero to the Japanese people, who bello \u201cLEITCH!\u201d every time he gets the ball. Carries ferociously like it\u2019s his last chance to touch the ball, and has led Japan\u2019s defensive effort with honour. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Justin Tipuric (Wales) The flanker was brilliant against Australia to help them to victory and was trusted to lead the team against Uruguay in order to provide his nous and intelligence to help see Wales to top spot. AFP/Getty Images 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) Is emerging into one of the most impactful forwards at the World Cup with a lovely blend of raw power and gifted handling making him a handful for opponents to stop, as both Samoa and Scotland discovered. Getty Images 10/16 9. Yutaka Nagare (Japan) A lot of what Japan have achieved at this World Cup is down to the speed in delivering the ball that Nagare is able to provide. Slow him down and teams will work out how to beat Japan, but so far no one has managed to do that and Nagare has punished them for it. AP 11/16 10. George Ford (England) A bright light in what has not been a shimmering campaign so far for England, but the way he has surged back into the mix after losing his place to Owen Farrell last year has been impressive. Captain on occasion, leading fly-half on the rest, Ford has even crossed the whitewash twice to get his account off to a strong start. AP 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The man pushing Leitch as the player of the tournament. Radradra was unstoppable against Wales and battered the Wallabies defence with his power running on the opening weekend. The biggest shame is that he is going home from the tournament already, but his impact has been felt by many a defender already in Japan, REUTERS 13/16 12. Ryoto Nakamura (Japan) The centre has made a name for himself at the World Cup, with his ability to blast through tackles standing out as a key reason why Japan are able to get over the gain line so often. Getty Images 14/16 13. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) There are not as many New Zealanders on this list as you\u2019d usually expect, but then the All Blacks have been going through the motion since the victory over South Africa three weeks ago. Not Lienert-Brown though, as he has stood out as one of the best performers of the tournament so far. Getty Images 15/16 14. Kotaro Matsushima (Japan) Five-try Kotro leads the way at the Rugby World Cup, with only Wales\u2019s Josh Adams able to match his haul at the tournament so far. Matsushima brings a huge work rate to the back-field and has an incredible ability to bounce off much bigger tacklers than he is, which says a lot about his skills and strength in the tackle. Getty Images 16/16 15. Beauden Barrett (New Zealand) Barrett may not have played for a few weeks after being rested against Nambia and having the final game with Canada cancelled, but the brilliant display against the Springboks at the strat of the tournament should be forgotten.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnder competition rules, a match which \u201ccannot be commenced on the day in which it is scheduled... shall not be postponed to the following day, and shall be considered as cancelled.\u201d And upon announcing its decision to call off England vs France and New Zealand vs Italy, World Rugby insisted it stood in \u201caccordance with what we said we would do before the tournament.\u201d\n\nAt the time, SRU chief executive Mark Dodson said he would not allow Scotland to become the World Cup\u2019s \u201ccollateral damage\u201d, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve had legal opinion \u2013 from a leading QC \u2013 that challenges World Rugby\u2019s interpretation.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference held on Tuesday, World Cup announced that the SRU has now been deferred to an independent disputes committee in light of its comments.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very careful that people behave appropriately and as a result of that, we\u2019ve referred to an independent disputes committee the behaviour and comments of the Scottish Rugby Union,\u201d said tournament director Alan Gilpin.\n\n\u201cI think on that basis it\u2019s probably inappropriate for us to comment any further.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby also hit back at criticism for its refusal to reschedule England\u2019s clash with France and New Zealand\u2019s match against Italy, with some suggesting the governing body had been pressurised into the decision by member unions.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t influenced by member unions,\u201d said Brett Gosper, CEO of World Cup. \u201cSome of the comments in and around were disappointing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not influenced by conversations or comments.\n\n\u201cWe made a call on the volume of what was in front of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were ready for typhoons \u2013 there\u2019s nothing exceptional about typhoons in this country. But this was an exceptional typhoon we haven\u2019t had the likes of since the 50s. So please understand this was an exceptional event that was thrown at this tournament, and the tournament has handled it brilliantly with obviously the issues around a few cancelled games. We knew this was coming but not of that scale.\n\n\u201cSo some of the comments were unfounded particularly I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\nGilpin added: \u201cWe were very clear with everyone before the tournament about the detailed contingency plans in place but also tournament rules about how contingency plans could be implemented.\n\n\u201cWhile we had appropriate discussions with a number of unions, no decisions were based on pressure from any particular unions.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s also important to clarify that we did not have those discussions with Ireland.\u201d\n\nDespite the controversy generated over the past week, and having seen the World Cup caught in the centre of an unprecedented typhoon which has so far claimed 70 lives, with 11 more missing, World Rugby said it would have no qualms in bringing the tournament back to Japan.\n\n\u201cNo hesitation at all in coming back to Japan for a rugby world cup,\u201d said Sir Bill Beaumont, chairman of World Rugby. \u201cNot at all. The response we\u2019ve had form the country, from the teams, has been exceptional.\u201d", "description": "The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) is\u00a0being investigated by World Rugby\u00a0for\u00a0proposing\u00a0legal action following\u00a0suggestions Scotland\u2019s Pool A showdown with Japan\u00a0could be abandoned after coming under from Typhoon Hagibis.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/05/world-rugby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
