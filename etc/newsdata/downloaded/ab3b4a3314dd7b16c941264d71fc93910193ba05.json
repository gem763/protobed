McCain blasted as \u201cfeckless, unpatriotic cowards\u201d fellow Republicans and current White House officials who were \u201cmad that President [Barack] Obama pulled out of Iraq\u201d but have been mum about the administration\u2019s Sunday night announcement.\n\nMcCain\u2019s comments, which she admitted diverged from the show\u2019s talking points and were \u201ca little bit rogue\u201d on her part, were met with applause from the studio audience.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued the Sunday night statement after President Donald Trump talked by telephone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The statement said that Turkey will soon move into northern Syria and that U.S. troops will neither support nor be involved in the operation. Furthermore, they \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot believe this is where we\u2019re at diplomatic-wise,\u201d a clearly indignant McCain said. \u201cWhat message is this sending to our allies and to our American troops who have fought and died\u201d as part of the effort in Syria to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nShe also wondered if the move was spurred by a \u201cwag the dog\u201d impulse to distract attention from the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nAlthough some GOP leaders have been silent on the administration\u2019s new policy, some of Trump\u2019s staunchest backers, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), quickly urged the president who is publicly urging Trump to reconsider.\n\nIn a series of tweets Monday morning, Graham called the decision \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honor,\u201d warning that it has \u201csent the most dangerous signal possible \u2015 America is an unreliable ally and it\u2019s just a matter of time before China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea act out in dangerous ways.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday afternoon added himself to this list of avid Trump supporters breaking with him on this issue and urging a reversal.\n\nThe Kurds \u2015 who have partnered with the Syrian Democratic Forces, becoming a dependable defense against the Islamic State in northern Syria \u2015 are considered a terrorist group by Turkey. With the U.S. presence gone from the region, the Kurds will be left vulnerable to attack.\n\nIn his initial reaction to the harsh criticism of the new policy announcement, Trump on Monday issued a threat to Turkey on Twitter, vowing that if the nation \u201cdoes anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\u201d", "description": "The \"View\" co-host slammed any Republican backing Trump's decision to step aside as Turkey prepares to invade Syria.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b6b13200000d0024ebfdd.jpeg?cache=dkbiig7hve&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
