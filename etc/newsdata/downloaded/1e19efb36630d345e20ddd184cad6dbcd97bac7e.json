Facundo Arrizabalaga/Pool via REUTERS\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will tour a Johannesburg township on Wednesday before meeting President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nelson Mandela\u2019s widow on a busy final day of their tour across southern Africa.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their four-month-old son Archie have been in the region for just over a week - their first overseas tour as a family.\n\nThey are due to meet young people and entrepreneurs in the township and visit initiatives tackling unemployment - South Africa\u2019s jobless rate hit an 11-year high this year.\n\nAfter that the couple will meet Graca Machel, widow of late president Nelson Mandela. The duke, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and sixth in line to the throne, last met her in 2015.\n\nHarry has been visiting southern Africa for two decades for holidays and conservation work, and also went to Botswana, Angola and Malawi during this trip.\n\nOn that solo leg, he appealed for more action on the climate and environment, and retraced his mother\u2019s footsteps at a former minefield in Angola. Meghan\u2019s own engagements largely focused on women\u2019s rights.\n\nLater on Wednesday, the pair will attend a reception celebrating Britain and South Africa\u2019s business relationship.\n\nThey will then meet Ramaphosa and his wife, Tshepo Motsepe, before flying back home in the evening.\n\nHarry said on Tuesday that Meghan had begun legal proceedings against a British newspaper, the Mail on Sunday, over the publication of a private letter that her lawyers said was \u201cunlawful\u201d. The newspaper said it stood by its story.
