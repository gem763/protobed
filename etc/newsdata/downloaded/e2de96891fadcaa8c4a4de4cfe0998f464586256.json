We leverage these relaxed guarantees in a protocol where we replace quorums with stochastic samples. Compared to quorums, samples are significantly smaller in size, leading to a more scalable design. \u201c\n\nThe paper goes on to outline a \u201cGossip-based algorithm\u201d \u2014 a probabilistic broadcast to ensure the validity and totality of all messages broadcast in the system, in which the links are reciprocated and undirected.\n\nThis is distinct from and more efficient than existing Byzantine broadcast protocols, they argue, which build on quorum systems with \u201cstrong intersection guarantees,\u201d resulting in \u201clinear per-process communication and computation complexity.\u201d\n\nReports frame new algorithm in terms of energy efficiency\n\nAs media reports on the researchers\u2019 work indicate, the pursuit of alternative, scalable and secure algorithms for distributed ledger systems are often interpreted within the framework of debates over the high power consumption involved in computation-intensive Bitcoin mining due to its underlying Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nA study in June found that three-quarters of Bitcoin mining activity is powered by renewable energy sources.\n\nThis September, fresh data indicated that the Bitcoin\u2019s network energy consumption was becoming more efficient even as hash rate continued to hit record highs.\n\nAs of July 2019, consumption was 69.79 terawatt-hours per year. One year earlier, the figure had been 71.12, notwithstanding an almost 60% lower hash rate.\n\nMining hardware behemoths such as Bitmain are meanwhile seeking to develop new solutions with greater processing capabilities and lower energy demands.", "description": "Researchers have developed a new algorithm for distributed ledger protocols, which reporters claim achieves security without the high power consumption of Bitco...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYmVhZTk0ZmZkZWVkN2ExYWRkMjA0YzhkMjAxYTQ2NDAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
