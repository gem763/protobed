Two thirds of MPs voted for it, paradoxically. They wouldn\u2019t vote for it on Monday, when a two-thirds majority was required, meaning 434 MPs. But yesterday, once the EU had published its decision to postpone Brexit and the election date was fixed in law for 12 December, 437 or 438 MPs \u2013 the numbers do not add up on parliament\u2019s website \u2013 passed the bill.\n\nBut Anna Soubry, leader of the five-strong Independent Group for Change, was probably right when she said, after the vote, that, \u201cin private \u2026 the majority of backbenchers on both sides do not want a general election\u201d. They voted for it mainly because their party leaders thought it was in their interest to do so.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The first question that voters ask, when an election is held earlier than law or convention requires, is, \u201cWhy are you bothering us now?\u201d An unsatisfactory answer didn\u2019t work out well for Ted Heath in 1974 or Theresa May in 2017.\n\nThat is why Boris Johnson has to explain why we need an election now, and so far he has not been totally convincing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There is enough doubt about it to make the launch of the election campaign mushy. The question is not whether Jeremy Corbyn would agree to more time, but whether Johnson could reverse the majority of 15 in the Commons that voted against the rushed timetable to get the Brexit bill through before tomorrow\u2019s deadline.\n\nAll he had to do was to persuade eight MPs who voted against that timetable to vote for a new, more generous one. As it was, six of them signed a motion asking for a 14-day timetable, and Alan Wager of King\u2019s College London argues that at least another two MPs would have voted for it \u2013 Stephen Lloyd and Rory Stewart.\n\nI suspect we will never know. Lloyd, the independent MP for Eastbourne, has now rejoined the Liberal Democrats and will be campaigning for Remain in this election, while Stewart wants to be the independent mayor of London, the Remain city.\n\nAnd even if Johnson could have got the legislation through, it might have been amended, although Wager rightly suggests that none of the amendments would have been fatal to the bill \u2013 the referendum amendment, in particular, did not have sufficient support.\n\nBut the prime minister never pushed it to a vote, to test whether or not he could capitalise on the majority in principle that he had secured for his Brexit deal in parliament. As Wager says, he chose, \u201cto the consternation of many in his own party\u201d to go for an election instead.\n\nThere may be cynical reasons for that: it may be his best chance of securing a personal mandate for the next five years.\n\nBut the idea that he did not need to have an election has undermined morale among his own MPs and party activists at the very moment when he needs them to be fired up and ready to go. And if the idea takes hold among the voters, it means his election campaign is trying to get off the ground with ice on the wings.", "description": "I asked a Conservative MP if he was looking forward to the election and he did that thing which is surprisingly difficult, of saying \u201cYes\u201d cheerfully and shaking his head.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/19/front-boris-johnson-28-october-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
