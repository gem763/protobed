Musk called Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d and subsequently a \u201cchild rapist\u201d after Unsworth mocked Musk\u2019s plan to rescue the players using a mini-submarine.\n\nUnsworth called Musk\u2019s proposal a \u201cstunt\u201d and told him to \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d.\n\nLawyers for Musk argued their client\u2019s statements were insults rather than allegations, and that \u201cpedo guy\u201d was a common insult in South Africa, where Musk grew up.\n\nOn Monday, however, Wilson ruled that the case must go to trial in December. The verdict prompted a defiant response.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the trial,\u201d Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, said in a statement provided to Bloomberg. \u201cWe understand that, while Musk has apologized, Unsworth would like to milk his 15 minutes of fame.\u201d\n\nIn September it emerged that Musk\u2019s lawyers were attempting to force a BuzzFeed reporter to testify in the case. Musk sent an email to journalist Ryan Mac in August 2018, replying to a request for comment on the \u201cpedo\u201d statement.\n\n\u201cI suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what\u2019s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole,\u201d Musk wrote.\n\nMusk later said the email was \u201coff the record\u201d. Mac had not agreed to those terms.", "description": "Los Angeles district judge ruled jury will decide whether Tesla chief\u2019s statements about British diver amount to defamation", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b403c6d6fba0cbf5a78ee0ef2094c592683cd72a/0_102_3143_1886/master/3143.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6145c4f68f6001c354ff33e049540d22", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
