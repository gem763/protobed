Many lawmakers expressed worry that it may lead to revival of IS as well as Russian presence and influence in the area \u2014 in addition to slaughter of many Kurds.\n\nAt the White House, Trump said the U.S. has no business in the region \u2014 and not to worry about the Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cThey know how to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, they\u2019re no angels.\u201d\n\nTrump said he is fulfilling a campaign promise to bring U.S. troops home from \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East \u2014 casting aside criticism that a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Syria not only betrays the Kurdish fighters but stains U.S. credibility around the world and opens an important region to Russia, which is moving in.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria\u2019s not happy about it. Let them work it out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have a problem at a border. It\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d\n\nTrump said he was sending Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara to urge the Turks to halt their weeklong offensive into northeastern Syria. But his remarks, first to reporters in the Oval Office and later at a news conference with his Italian counterpart, suggested he sees little at stake for America.\n\n\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So, there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them fight their own wars.\u201d\n\nMore than once, Trump suggested the United States has little at stake in the Middle East because it is geographically distant \u2014 a notion shared by some prior to Sept. 11, 2001, when al-Qaida militants used Afghanistan as a base from which to attack the U.S. That attack set off a series of armed conflicts, including in Iraq, that Trump considers a waste of American lives and treasure.\n\nThe current withdrawal is the worst decision of Trump\u2019s presidency, said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who meets often with the president and is one of his strongest and most important supporters in Congress.\n\n\u201cTo those who think the Mideast doesn\u2019t matter to America, remember 9/11 \u2014 we had that same attitude on 9/10 2001.\u201d\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he strongly disagreed with Trump and had told the president so. But he asked, \u201cWhat tools do we have\u201d to back up that disagreement?\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told reporters he didn\u2019t know what could be done to undo the harm he felt was resulting.\n\n\u201cThere are some mistakes that are not easy to reverse. And there are some that are irreversible,\u201d said Rubio, who was a Trump rival for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nTurkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria a week ago, two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the area. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he wants to create a 30-kilometer (20-mile) -deep \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria.\n\nAnkara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s and which Turkey, as well as the U.S. and European Union, designate as a terrorist organization.\n\nTrump mischaracterized the progress made thus far by the U.S. military in carrying out his instructions to withdraw all 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria. He referred to the approximately two dozen soldiers who evacuated from Turkey\u2019s initial attack zone last week, but cast that as meaning the U.S. has \u201clargely\u201d completed its pullout.\n\nA U.S. official familiar with planning for the withdrawal of the 1,000 said that they are consolidating onto two main bases but have not yet begun flying out of Syria in significant numbers. Military equipment is being gathered and flown out, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the withdrawal, which poses big security risks.\n\nTrump downplayed the crisis that followed his decision to pull out of Syria, which critics say amounted to giving Turkey a green light to invade against the Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe,\u201d Trump said, adding that he\u2019s more than willing to let adversaries fight it out in that area of the Middle East.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, \u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way, as they shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nTrump did impose new sanctions on Turkey this week in an attempt to force Erdogan to end his assault. But he said Wednesday, \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to come home.\u201d\n\nEven as Trump defended his removal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, he praised his decision to send more troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran.\n\nTrump said the U.S. is sending missiles and \u201cgreat power\u201d to the Saudis, and \u201cthey\u2019re paying for that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writers Alan Fram, Darlene Superville and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Washing his hands of America's presence in Syria, President Donald Trump declared Wednesday the U.S. has no stake in supporting the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/555080_trump-18367-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-speaks-meeting-italian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
