REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev/Illustration/\n\n(Reuters) - Visa Inc\u2019s (V.N) quarterly profit beat analysts\u2019 estimates on Thursday, helped by growth in overall customer spending, which boosted fees for the world\u2019s largest payment processor.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares rose 1.3% in extended trading.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, Visa earned $1.47 per share in the fourth quarter, while analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.43, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nVisa and its smaller rival Mastercard Inc (MA.N) have stepped up marketing and innovation spending to keep people using cards, as customers increasingly shift to digital and mobile payments services to make transactions.\n\nVisa\u2019s total payments volume rose 8.7% to $2.27 trillion on a constant dollar basis, with the United States - its largest market - accounting for about 45% of the total.\n\nPayments volume represents the dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying Visa\u2019s branding. The company charges a fee every time a merchant swipes a card that uses its network.\n\nThe number of transactions processed rose 13.2% to 47.82 billion.\n\nThe company's net income rose 6.3% to $3.03 billion, or $1.34 per Class A share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
