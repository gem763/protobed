Opposition parties have been broadly supportive. Flag-waving Turks greet soldiers in border towns as they prepare for battle, and the news media memorializes Erdogan\u2019s utterances in headlines.\n\nAt the same time, critical voices in Turkey have been cowed, shouted down and in some cases detained.\n\nAD\n\nErdogan has shown no sign he intends to stop the offensive or even limit its scope. To the contrary, Turkey appeared to expand the operation Monday, sending allied Syrian rebel fighters to capture the town of Manbij \u2014 miles from the area inside northern Syria where the Turkish government says it intends to establish a \u201csafe zone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nForeign observers have been alarmed by Erdogan\u2019s insistence on pursuing an operation that has upended Syria\u2019s conflict and set off a new wave of civilian suffering. But Turkey\u2019s government has been eyeing its domestic audience, too, and betting it could weather the international outrage, analysts said.\n\n\u201cHe is very defiant. I don\u2019t think he takes these criticisms into consideration,\u201d said Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at Istanbul\u2019s Kadir Has University, speaking of Erdogan\u2019s reaction to the scoldings from countries such as Germany, Britain and the United States.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s threats against Turkey \u2014 including the imposition Monday of sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior officials \u2014 were unlikely to dent Erdogan\u2019s support. \u201cLike in the rest of the world, everyone is very resentful of the American president,\u201d Ozel said.\n\nAD\n\nFor Erdogan, along with his senior aides who have spoken publicly in support of the operation in recent days, \u201cthe line is very rigid. They are 100 percent sure of their righteousness,\u201d he added.\n\nThe stated goal of the mission is to clear Syrian Kurdish fighters from northern Syria, a pledge Erdogan has made repeatedly to the Turkish public. Ankara considers the fighters terrorists because of their links to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. The security establishment in Turkey shares Erdogan\u2019s goal and has carried out regular attacks on PKK fighters in northern Iraq for years, albeit with far less fanfare, Ozel said.\n\nAD\n\nErdogan says he intends to relocate hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey to whatever slice of territory Turkish forces carve out of Syria. The plan is largely motivated by domestic politics: During elections, including recent municipal polls, Turkish voters have registered dissatisfaction with Erdogan\u2019s ruling party for its years-long support of Syrian refugees, which has entailed providing millions of migrants with access to state services.\n\nAD\n\nRefugee advocates say the Syrians are actually a boon to the economy and are being unfairly scapegoated. Erdogan\u2019s plan, they add, is both impractical and unjust. Regardless, the government has reversed its liberal attitude toward the refugees, tightening security at the border, imposing restrictions on their travel within Turkey and deporting hundreds of Syrian refugees to their home country in recent months.\n\n\u201cPolitically, they are too costly a burden,\u201d Ozel said. \u201cI think the part of the operation that may be appealing to the Turkish population is the prospect of emptying homes, streets and cities from guests who have overstayed their welcomes,\u201d he said, referring to Turkey\u2019s offensive.\n\nAD\n\nAs Turkey has pushed back at the criticism from abroad, the news media at home have been Erdogan\u2019s unflagging ally.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe press has been star-struck,\u201d Selim Koru, a Turkish political analyst, wrote in a Twitter thread about the atmosphere in Turkey during the incursion. \u201c \u2018Security experts\u2019 have taken over the airwaves, pictures of joint operations rooms invoke Hollywood movies. Even previously critical editors now give the commander-in-chief their rapturous attention,\u201d he wrote.\n\nEchoing Erdogan\u2019s rebuke of Western allies for suggesting Turkey should negotiate with the Kurds in Syria, one headline read Monday: \u201cDid you recruit the terror organization to NATO?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll of you together couldn\u2019t make one Turkey,\u201d another headline read, amplifying Erdogan\u2019s put-down of the Arab League after it condemned the Turkish offensive.\n\nThe government has bristled at rare instances of internal dissent. When members of a pro-Kurdish political party tried to march in Istanbul on Sunday, nine people were detained. And when Mustafa Akinci, the pro-Turkish president of North Cyprus, wrote on social media that Turkey\u2019s offensive would be bloody and called for \u201cdialogue and diplomacy,\u201d he was denounced by senior Turkish officials, including Erdogan.\n\nAD\n\nHakan Demir, the website editor for Birgun, a daily newspaper, was detained last week after publishing a story that reprinted a statement by the Syrian Kurdish fighters who are the target of the Turkish offensive.\n\nAD\n\nThe authorities came for him at 4 a.m. Thursday, when Demir was up watching the television show \u201cHannibal,\u201d he said. He was released later that day but is still being investigated, he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWith this operation, the government is trying to push the media to follow a particular line. But the whole world is watching,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government wants all media to do their propaganda for them. We want to show developments with an independent eye.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Condemned abroad, the military operation against Syrian Kurds has generated little public debate\u00a0in Turkey.", "authors": ["Kareem Fahim", "Istanbul Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QaYlpnFXLbxUeB0auLCSKAQG-tM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C5YXHOXOZEI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
