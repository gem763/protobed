Further, this natural remedy does not involve a pill, fad, or spending a lot of money. Yes, you\u2019ve probably heard this song and dance on daytime talk shows and late-night infomercials. But before you spend your money on the next big thing, I want to tell you about the most effective weight management technique since humans began walking the earth. Seriously. It\u2019s exercise. But before you roll your eyes or tune me out, give me just a minute. Exercise doesn\u2019t have to mean pain\u2026it doesn\u2019t have to mean hours in the gym\u2026it doesn\u2019t even have to be every day (at least at first). But even just a little bit of exercise is better for your body than you may realize.\n\nLosing weight vs. Keeping weight off\n\nLosing weight and keeping weight off are not one in the same. It\u2019s something I tell my patients all the time. If you are trying to lose weight, all the exercise your body can handle will have little impact on your waistline if you continue eating an unhealthy diet. And if you are trying to keep weight off, a healthy diet can only get you so far. Your body needs exercise. I know this sounds like common sense but it cannot be overstated. A healthy diet and exercise go hand-in-hand but they work in different ways. Here are two common scenarios that prove it. Scenario #1: You do not eat a very healthy diet but you just began working out three times a week. You push yourself pretty hard and you burn about 500 calories per workout. Your body will demand that you consume more calories to help it rehydrate and recover. Without a diet change, you are just putting empty and unhealthy calories back into your body at the very time it needs healthy calories. Result: Little to no weight loss. Scenario #2: You\u2019ve lost 10-20 pounds in the span of months with a strict diet. This is possible without working out even once. After that weight goal is reached, you get a little lax on following the diet. In time, you slowly return to your pre-diet eating habits. Result: You slowly regain the weight that you lost. If you have recently lost weight, congratulations! It probably wasn\u2019t easy, and I\u2019m glad that you have committed to becoming a healthier and happier you. Whether you realize it or not, losing weight is only the first step. The larger goal is living and feeling healthy.\n\nA pill-free prescription for lifelong health\n\nKeeping lost weight off\n\nPrevention/management of heart disease\n\nPrevention/management of breast cancer\n\nPrevention/management of osteoporosis\n\nPrevention/management of Type-2 diabetes\n\nPrevention/management of mental illness\n\nImproved self-esteem and confidence\n\nMaking exercise a part of your routine\n\nI normally don\u2019t do this, but I\u2019m writing a prescription right now to you and anyone else who might read this: Exercise! If you don\u2019t exercise now, it does not take much to get started . If you already exercise, add a little more to your routine. As with nearly all medications, my prescription has some side effects that you need to know:Also like many prescriptions, the intended effects may take a week or two to kick in. So, it\u2019s important to stick with it because when they do kick in, the effects on your body will be powerful and positive. But unlike a lot of prescription medications, exercise is 100% natural and it\u2019s relatively low-cost\u2014often totally free. And exercise comes in a wide variety of forms that can fit into nearly all lifestyles.One final disclaimer on this prescription: I\u2019m not just prescribing that you exercise, but that you exercise regularly. After all, a person with a prescription doesn\u2019t just take it by the light of the blue moon, right? I want you to try to exercise three to five times a week. It does not take a lot to get started either. Begin by walking 5 minutes a day. Then 10 minutes a day. If you walk your dog, walk it more often and for a few more blocks than usual. Gardening, dancing, riding your bike. Taking the stairs a floor or two instead of the elevator. All of these activities do not take a lot of resources to start doing today. Talk with your doctor about which exercises would work best for you. For those, like me, who prefer structure and routines, the five-a-week plan is a great way to engrain exercise into your life. Simply put, five-a-week means five exercise sessions of 30 minutes or more per week. You pick the exercises and fill in your schedule. And pick exercises that you enjoy\u2014the more fun you can make it, the more likely you are to stay the course. Those who are just beginning to exercise for the time in a while, I advise you to start with low-impact exercises such as walking, swimming or biking. Start slow. Something is better than nothing. But if you feel dizzy, faint, or you\u2019re in pain, stop immediately and talk with your doctor. When you are at a point where you are no longer challenged by the five-a-week plan, you can add more time to each routine, add more intense exercises to the routine (i.e. aerobics), or make your existing exercises more rigorous (e.g. walking faster and further). The five-a-week plan is effective because it makes exercise a part of your daily routine\u2014more of a habit than a chore\u2014instead of something you will do if time permits. This helps prevent the \u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow\u201d mentality.\n\nTips to motivate and reward yourself\n\nTechnology can also keep you locked in the habit of exercising. Fit trackers and exercise apps can make exercise fun and competitive, even if you are just competing with yourself. Also, now that television itself has become an on-demand service, you don\u2019t have to watch your favorite shows when they air. For example, you can record afternoon shows to watch later that day or night \u2013 after you exercise of course. Or, you can walk in place in front of the tv, and combine getting healthy and getting the news or watching your soaps. A rewards system is also a great motivating agent. For example, if you meet or exceed your weekly or monthly exercise goals, reward yourself with a massage, weekend getaway, date night, a bouquet of flowers, new clothes, a day off work, and more. A simple Google search of exercise rewards yields many creative ideas. However, I do advise against rewarding yourself with indulgent food. A treat now and then is OK\u2014everyone needs an occasional \u201ccheat day\u201d as long as you don\u2019t go overboard\u2014but an unhealthy reward for healthy habits is counterproductive and sends the wrong signal. The key is to avoid being sedentary for long periods of time. If you are watching a show, walk around the house during commercials. If you sit at a desk for long periods of your day, get up and walk around the office every hour. Even better, walk outside and get some natural vitamin D from the sun! Now go out and fill that prescription!\n\nReferences", "description": "What if I told you that I know of a .09/02/2019 3:03:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
