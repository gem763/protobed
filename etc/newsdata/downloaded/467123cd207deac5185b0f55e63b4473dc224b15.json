Our fashion expert shows you how to look stylish this autumn", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s a nip in the air, the nights are drawing in and soon the clocks will be going back \u2013 yes, it\u2019s unmistakably autumn.\n\nBut while we might miss the lighter nights and (very slightly!) warmer temperatures, there is some good news: it\u2019s time to break out the knitwear.\n\nThis is truly a season to look forward to, with cosy jumpers and warm wools in gorgeous colours that not only keep you toasty but looking stylish too.\n\nAs the nights draw in, we can all use the change in weather to look at our Autumnal style\n\nHere, top fashion stylist Lucas Armitage talks us through the latest trends and gives his pick of JD Williams\u2019 current autumn range:\n\nHe says: 'September is a key time in fashion: everyone is editing their wardrobe, taking stock of what they have and adding key pieces. It\u2019s a time of reinvention.\n\n'It\u2019s also a time to work out how to transition from summer into autumn and winter. What I\u2019m seeing is a lot of layering - try wearing a roll neck sweater under the shirt dress you wore on your holiday and with a chunky boot.\n\nJD Williams\u2019 Cosy Edge To Edge Coatigan (\u00a345) is perfect with a satin dress or over jeans\n\nA big trend this year is the long-line cardigan which is a great alternative to a coat in autumn. They\u2019re being worn slightly off-the-shoulder over dresses or, if they\u2019re high on the neck, wrapped around and belted with nothing underneath.\n\nEvoking high fashion vibes for me is JD Williams\u2019 Cosy Edge To Edge Coatigan (\u00a345) with its very current check. Wear it over a satin spot print dress with a little ankle boot when you\u2019re going out \u2013 that clash will give it a fashion feel. Alternatively, it will look equally great over a t-shirt, jeans and a nice boot for the supermarket or day-to-day.\n\nAnother big trend is embellished trims. Buttons are becoming a feature rather than just a function and a lot off top designers are doing oversized cardigans with intricate detailing on the pockets and neckline.\n\nBecause of this the Button Split Neck Tunic (\u00a318) is very on trend. It\u2019s an easy-to-wear play on the standard chunky roll neck with an elongated shoulder giving it an 80s vibe which has also been seen on the catwalks recently.\n\nJD Williams Button Split Neck Tunic (\u00a318) comes in a range of colours, including black, left and burnt orange, right, and is an easy-to-wear play on the standard chunky roll neck\n\nIt\u2019s got good colour options \u2013 black, burnt orange and ivory. You always see a lot of black knitwear but burnt orange and shades of red are very strong this season.\n\nI\u2019d style this tunic with leather leggings or wear it oversized as a dress with boots or with 10-denier tights and a high court shoe. Layer necklaces over it and have some fun.\n\nI think in previous seasons we\u2019ve thought of knitwear as strictly daytime but now it\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing more of in the evening and people are being more innovative about where they wear it and when.\n\nHitting both this year\u2019s red and 80s trends is the Cosy Red Multi-Print Boyfriend Jumper (\u00a334)\n\nThis button tunic jumper is just the kind of very adaptable piece you can do that with.\n\nAlso hitting both this year\u2019s red and 80s trends is the Cosy Red Multi-Print Boyfriend Jumper (\u00a334). If you want to get autumn/winter trendy, this is the one for you.\n\nTranslate it to an early evening drinks look with a slick of red lipstick and it commands attention. Layer it over a fitted black pencil skirt and red court shoe and it will look cool. Or wrap a belt around it for cocktail hour \u2013 one with an embellished buckle would be fun.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about looking too \u2018busy\u2019 as we\u2019ve seen a lot of busy-ness on the catwalk. We\u2019re seeing prints with layered necklaces, embellished belts and brooches \u2013 it\u2019s about putting embellishment on pattern and it\u2019s an exciting thing to do, giving your look an edge.\n\nThis JD Williams mustard yellow Cosy High Neck Jumper (\u00a328) is right on trend this season\n\nIf you want a piece you can thrown on over anything and that you don\u2019t have to think about, there\u2019s the Cosy High Neck Ribbed Detail Jumper (\u00a335)\n\nJD Williams have really got the colours of this season right. Their mustard yellow Cosy High Neck Jumper (\u00a328) is nice and vibrant with a texture to it I really like and a slightly-dropped shoulder for a relaxed 80s feel. You just know it\u2019s going to be cosy.\n\nAnd because it\u2019s not too chunky, it\u2019s a great piece for layering. Try a nice coat over the top or I\u2019d love to see it work with a skirt. People will have pleated skirts from summer and you can carry it through to autumn with a knit like this.\n\nFinally if you want a piece you can thrown on over anything and that you don\u2019t have to think about, there\u2019s the Cosy High Neck Ribbed Detail Jumper (\u00a335). I really like this and think it would probably be the most versatile piece of knitwear you could own.\n\nIt would work well over black or blue denim, you could style it over a dress \u2013 that would be a cool 2019 way of wearing it \u2013 and if you don\u2019t feel like that, over jeans and a chunky boot.\n\nIt\u2019s a box ticker \u2013 if you\u2019re having a day where you don\u2019t feel great about your figure, it will cover you up and not cling while giving you the catwalk vibe of nonchalant, oversized knitwear in an easy-to-wear way.", "description": "Autumn is truly a season to look forward to, with cosy jumpers and warm wools in gorgeous colours that not only keep you toasty but looking stylish too.", "authors": ["Lorraine Fisher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/16/18296992-0-image-a-6_1569859122572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
