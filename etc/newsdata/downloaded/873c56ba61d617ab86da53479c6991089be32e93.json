The Washington Post suggested the leader might have been Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin or North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un.\n\nLater stories accused Trump of abusing his powers by offering Zelensky a quid pro quo: If Ukraine probed Democratic wannabe Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Trump would send it nearly $400 million in aid.\n\nTrue, in the call, Trump asks Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d why a Ukrainian prosecutor probing a company that employed Biden\u2019s son was fired, especially since Biden, as Trump put it, \u201cwent around bragging that he stopped the prosecution.\u201d\n\nHe did: \u201cIf the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u2019\u201d Joe Biden said he threatened Ukraine officials in 2016; \u201cSon of a bitch. He got fired.\u201d (Quid pro quo?)\n\nYet in the call, Trump offers no deal, nor mentions US aid (which was released soon after, in any case), nor \u201cpromises\u201d anything.\n\nThe transcript does show that Trump still doesn\u2019t realize that his job is different than being a pundit. It\u2019s not impeachable, but he shouldn\u2019t be encouraging foreign leaders to pursue cases that help him. Just bring it up at your rallies, Mr. President.\n\nBut that\u2019s far different from the out-of-control prez painted by the media in stories that relied on leaks and third- or fourth-party accounts \u2014 not even hearsay, but gossip. Another key until-now-missing bit of key information: The intel community inspector general reportedly found that the whistleblower showed signs of \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of \u201ca rival candidate.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the end; Central players have yet to speak publicly. (Acting intel boss Joseph Maguire is to testify Thursday.) And news reports say the whistleblower complaint involves \u201cmultiple instances,\u201d not just one call.\n\nEvidence may yet emerge of Trump wrongdoing. But so far it\u2019s the press that comes off the worst.", "description": "The now-released transcript of President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s prez, Volodymyr Zelensky, shows just why Americans have so little faith in the news media.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/usa-trump_whistleblower.1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
