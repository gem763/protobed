As officers approached the scene, they met Torell\u2019s father, who was also out looking for him.\n\nNeither realised they were looking for the same person. The police found Torell first and fired 25 times, including two fatal shots in his back. He died at the scene.\n\nDuring the trial of the police officers involved, which reaches a verdict on Thursday, Swedes have relived the details of that tragic morning in August last year and the catalogue of errors and misunderstandings that led to Torell\u2019s death.\n\nPolice officers Karl Johan Thulin and Hans Christian Appelgren are charged with misconduct, and Hannes Erik B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m is charged with negligence causing another\u2019s death.\n\nThe case has also posed questions about the readiness of the police to resort to firearms as they battle escalating gang violence in Swedish cities. Police shot dead six people last year, an unprecedented increase.\n\nCriminologists have warned of an \u201carms race\u201d between gangs and police, while politicians compete to portray themselves as toughest on crime.\n\nSweden\u2019s annual homicide rate remains one of the lowest in the world, at about one case per 100,000 inhabitants. But shootings have been rising. Since 2011, when statistics on the use of firearms began to be recorded, the number of deadly shootings has more than doubled, from 17 cases in 2011 to 43 last year.\n\nThe country was stunned six weeks ago when a masked man fatally shot a young mother in the head in broad daylight in Malm\u00f6. She was holding her baby at the time. Sweden has also had a spate of explosions in town centres, as gang members have used explosives and grenades in their battles with other gangs and the police.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police officers at the scene of a Stockholm metro station explosion in January 2018.

A sticking point was the right\u2019s proposal to ban convicted gang members from returning to areas where they had previously been active.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing is to be very tough on crime, to get the criminals off the streets,\u201d says Johan Forssell, the justice spokesman for the centre-right Moderate party. \u201cThe police cannot do that today because they lack the tools.\u201d\n\nThe government, a minority coalition of Social Democrats and Greens propped up by liberals and the left, hit back with a set of proposals, the core of which involves strengthening police powers.\n\n\u201cThe previous centre-right government slashed the training of new police officers, which we have almost tripled since 2014,\u201d says David \u00c5hl\u00e9n, an adviser to the justice minister. \u201cBut they need to be able to take the criminals off the streets faster, for a longer time, and give them tougher punishments.\u201d\n\n'What the hell are you up to?' Arson attacks draw Swedish PM's ire Read more\n\nSome fear, however, that the panic over violent gang crime risks creating a mindset among police where they shoot first and ask questions later. Following the death of Eric Torell, there were warnings the police were ramping up their tactics to \u201cmeet hard with hard\u201d.\n\n\u201cOfficers had told me they were worried a tragedy like this would happen because of the police focus on extreme situations,\u201d says Stefan Holgersson, who describes himself as a whistleblower inside the police force.\n\nHolgersson says the police risk creating a generation of nervous officers who expect the worst and therefore are more likely to put themselves and others in danger.\n\n\u201cWhen you train for gang or terrorist activity, you get that picture in your mind that this is how to act in stressful situations,\u201d Holgersson says. \u201cAnd when the police act hard, they risk turning people into enemies of the police. Their training is making things worse.\u201d\n\nHolgersson\u2019s point of view appears to be supported by statements such one from an officer commenting on Eric Torell\u2019s death. \u201cIf we encounter something we believe is a firearm, then we will shoot to eliminate the threat,\u201d the officer told Swedish media. \u201cYou do not do this by hitting someone in the leg. We aim for the chest; that\u2019s how we\u2019ve practised.\u201d\n\nAway from the political debate, Swedish police officers are patiently working to restore relationships with communities where people fear to come forward as witnesses to violence. The number of shootings fell last year compared with 2017, points out Ch Supt Gunnar Appelgren, who has led the police operation in areas of Stockholm worst affected by violent gangs.\n\n\u201cWe have more police on the streets, building relationships, earning trust, working with local councils and businesses,\u201d says Appelgren. \u201cBut it goes unnoticed because you have the shootings, which are extremely high profile.\u201d\n\nThe three police officers on trial for the death of Eric Torell stand accused of not following procedures and failing to stop shooting when he turned his back.\n\nEric\u2019s mother, Katarina S\u00f6derberg, says she cannot understand how they failed to see her son had Down\u2019s syndrome.\n\nHe was like a three-year-old, she says, and the only word he knew was \u201cmum\u201d. \u201cEric had no understanding of danger. His starting point was always that everyone was kind.\u201d", "description": "Political pressure to tackle rising gang violence contributed to Eric Torell\u2019s death, say critics", "authors": ["David Crouch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c21eb7c5dcb6bef6e832dca9742421312df404b6/66_306_5157_3094/master/5157.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab8635867c80ab04e2425849e84428fc"}
