We look at Tesco Clubcard Plus", "language": "en", "text": "Slim profits from online sales are prompting supermarkets to boost their customer loyalty schemes to lure shoppers back into the stores.\n\nLeading the pack is Tesco, which before the end of this year will launch a loyalty subscription scheme, Tesco Clubcard Plus, rewarding customers with juicy discounts on their regular shop.\n\nIn return for \u00a37.99 a month \u2013\u00a395.88 a year \u2013 cardholders will receive 10 per cent discounts for two big shops made in its supermarkets each month \u2013 up to a maximum discount of \u00a320 a shop. If you spend \u00a3200 twice a month then you will be well in the money after a year \u2013 by \u00a3384.12 once you take into account the subscription bill.\n\nBefore the end of this year, Tesco will launch loyalty subscription scheme Tesco Clubcard Plus\n\nRetail analyst Bryan Roberts from consultancy TCC Global says that disillusionment has grown with some older style loyalty schemes, especially since Tesco and others scaled back some of the benefits of their points schemes over the last couple of years.\n\nRoberts says: \u2018Our research shows that a typical UK shopper owns five loyalty cards but uses just two or three. Most shoppers want to be rewarded for loyalty by more than just a loyalty card. This goes some way to explain why Tesco and also Sainsbury\u2019s have revamped their offerings.\u2019\n\nAs well as money off the regular shopping basket, the new Tesco arrangement \u2013 a first of its kind subscription scheme that will be closely monitored by other retailers \u2013 provides discounts on non-food brands such as its clothing range (F&F), Tesco Pet and Fox & Ivy homewares. By committing to a monthly payment, Tesco hopes shoppers will also spend more.\n\nThe programme is open to existing and new Clubcard holders.\n\nBy committing to a monthly payment, Tesco hopes shoppers will also spend more\n\nThe original Clubcard scheme (introduced in 1995) is still popular despite its benefits being diluted. Membership lets shoppers earn 1 point for every \u00a31 spent in-store and online. On fuel it is 1 point for every \u00a32 spent.\n\nThe points are converted into vouchers posted out every three months that can be spent in store. Customers can get vouchers more quickly by downloading them on to the Clubcard Smartphone app.\n\nCard users can boost voucher values threefold \u2013 reduced from fourfold last year \u2013 by spending them with scores of partners. So, a 50p voucher can be turned into \u00a31.50 if spent at restaurants such as Prezzo and Caf\u00e9 Rouge or towards a magazine subscription such as Bird Watching or Country Living.\n\nA \u00a32.50 voucher can grow into 600 Avios points or 625 Virgin Atlantic Flying Club Miles \u2013 a special fivefold boost in value. Beware that vouchers normally expire after two years.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s this month upgraded its loyalty scheme \u2013 called Nectar \u2013 by moving it on to a new app and website. First launched in 2002, the card already offers 18million customers points and rewards including money off shopping, or on rail and Eurostar tickets, days out and trips to the cinema. The basic premise remains the same \u2013 one point for every \u00a31 spent.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s has upgraded its Nectar loyalty scheme by moving it on to a new app and website\n\nThere is already an app option but current users must upgrade to benefit from new more personalised offers. The new version lets customers scan their phones in Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 and Esso petrol stations \u2013 instead of carrying a plastic card. The card can still be used in stores and any points already saved will be available on the app.\n\nPoints can be collected via more than 400 partners, including Argos, Asos, Debenhams, Next and Topshop. You can download the \u2018Nectar toolbar\u2019 to add to your web browser to alert you when you are on a site where you can earn or spend points. The personalised offers will go out every Thursday via an emailed newsletter, at nectar.com and in the app.\n\nNectar users should try to collect or spend at least some points during the year \u2013 otherwise the account will be closed after 12 months of inactivity.\n\nRoberts says: \u2018Are these new schemes enough to tempt people away from low cost supermarkets such as Lidl and Aldi \u2013 where a shop typically costs 10 to 15 per cent less? Probably not, but the Tesco scheme looks great potential value for regular Tesco shoppers who spend more than \u00a340 twice a month.\u2019", "description": "Before the end of this year, Tesco will launch a loyalty subscription scheme, Tesco Clubcard Plus, rewarding customers with juicy discounts on their regular shop.", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
