Cocooned in my Notting Hill bubble, I\u2019ve actually contemplated the need for a Range Rover (locally known as the Chelsea tractor). I shudder at the thought. What was I thinking?\n\n\n\nBlackpool jolts me back to reality. Visiting Alex\u2019s family in the North is going to be the break I need. It might help me tune back into my true self. As we drive past a Cinderella horse and carriage and a water slide on our right, Lola screams with joy: \u201cLook at the water party!\u201d I see the Pepsi Max Big One roller coaster in the near distance, and I know we are nearly at our hotel.\n\nA wave of sadness rushes over me: Alex isn\u2019t with us. I last visited Blackpool with him, long before I had his two children after his death, via IVF, from a batch of frozen sperm. Alex had wanted to show me his hometown, a place he proudly referred to as \u201cshithole Britain\u201d. Alex left Blackpool aged 16 but we often returned to see his family. And now, even without him, it\u2019s a wonderful place \u2013 especially now with the kids.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOur room overlooks Blackpool Pleasure Beach, with its high roller-coaster tracks and metal horses that whizz past. The sound of screams melts into the air as we text Alex\u2019s mum to say we have arrived. The chilly North is made considerably warmer with the huge welcome we get from Alex\u2019s family. In no time, his mum, sisters, cousin and uncle have all congregated for a meal, where they throw their arms around my two daughters, which is hugely emotional especially as my kids have never met their dad.\n\nBright and early the next day I am down at the Pleasure Beach \u2013 a sprawling fairground \u2013 with the kids. There are no yummy mummies here: it is more rain sodden mums like me, wearing plastic ponchos to stay dry. I have never played with the children so much: we got a full day pass at 10am and we are still riding the rides at 4pm.\n\nBut it is later on the pier that I notice a clairvoyant. She must be good as there are loads of photos of her with Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Michael Parkinson; unless they been cleverly photoshopped. She has been working on the North pier for more than 30 years \u2013 a Romany gypsy, whose family have been reading the futures of holidaymakers for years.\n\nHaving your fortune told is all part of the fun of Blackpool, along with sticks of rock and donkeys. But who knows, perhaps I could get in touch with Alex? I\u2019m open to these things, I suppose, and why not? Being a clairvoyant she really should have known I was banging on the door to see her \u2013 but she isn\u2019t there \u2013 and when I ask somebody when she will be back \u2013 they tell me she follows her own schedule.\n\nI\u2019m not having much luck communicating with Alex. Oh well. He was hard to get hold of alive, let alone dead. However, we did appear to get in touch with Alex a few years ago, when Alex\u2019s sisters took me to a spiritualist church in Torquay, where one of his sister\u2019s lives. We had to stand up and sing Abba\u2019s \u201cI Believe in Angels\u201d as part of the order of service, but at least the medium was accurate.\n\nWhen she told me that he said I needed to let go of him, I felt like I had been dumped from the afterlife\n\nWhen she told me that he said I needed to let go of him \u2013 which would also help him to move on \u2013 I felt like I had been dumped from the afterlife.\n\nShe went on to reveal that it would be Lola\u2019s birthday at the end month (February). Then she reported from Alex that he felt like \u201che had passed his sell by date\u201d when he took his own life; and was sorry for \u201cgoing over the top sometimes\u201d. He wanted me to be happy \u2013 \u201cyou don\u2019t know what is around the corner\u201d. Then he told the medium, apparently, that we had two children together. I said: \u201cNo only the one! He has another child with his ex.\u201d\n\nThe medium said: \u201cNo he\u2019s quite adamant you have two children together.\u201d\n\nIt got me thinking later that night \u2013 indeed I did have an embryo on ice in Russia \u2013 maybe it was a sign! So that is when I decided to go for it with baby number two \u2013 who became Liberty, now 12 months old.\n\nI really hope the Blackpool clairvoyant is going to be as good as the one from Torquay. Alex\u2019s sister tells me she went to her school, which demystifies her somewhat, but I don\u2019t let it put me off. I hand over the cash, which I put under her crystal ball. I\u2019m told that I have a musical daughter and will get married to somebody I know \u2013 but there is a barrier that I can get over with the right approach.\n\n\u201cBut you are born to be a widow,\u201d she says. I wonder if she knows? But no, she is not picking up on Alex at all. She means that my future husband will die before me \u2013 \u201cbut even by a day only\u201d she adds. Oh god, not again, I think. I can\u2019t go through another death of a partner. Anyway the clairvoyant tells me that I will be more financially stable by this time next year and have a second home abroad. Lottery?\n\nShe covers illness, marriage, old age, love and health, in 10 minutes \u2013 it\u2019s all a bit dubious. But there is no mention of Alex\u2019s death, no message from the afterlife, so I leave disappointed.\n\nI walk back down the promenade to meet the girls who are with Alex\u2019s cousin. The clairvoyant wouldn\u2019t let them in in case there were \u201cenergies\u201d around. I see a hen party with the bride dressed as Elvis Presley and her entourage in 1950s dresses. By dark the place will be teaming with people getting legless. But I will be asleep with the girls in our super king-sized bed at the hotel. As I look at the empty chair next to me, I remember Alex sitting there with his feet up on the open window \u2013 smoking a fag \u2013 watching me zoom past on a roller coaster. Who would have thought I would be back with his two children and he would be dead. I pinch myself \u2013 I couldn\u2019t make this up.", "description": "As I drive up Blackpool promenade with its bright lights and colourful\u00a0shops, one with a sign saying \u201cwe sell fags and poppers\u201d, I\u2019m reassuringly\u00a0reminded of\u00a0what the real world looks like.
