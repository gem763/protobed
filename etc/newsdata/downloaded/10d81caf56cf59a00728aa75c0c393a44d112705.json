And while traditional stainless steel scrubs up well you may find some of the more creative and design-led styles are not suited to packing into the dishwasher, so save these for the occasional dinner party and wash later in warm soapy water.\n\nAlthough you can purchase knives, forks and spoons individually, or less commonly, in single place settings, our top cutlery picks are in sets of at least 16, which will cater for four people around the table. But it\u2019s wise to go bigger on numbers for those times the extended family gather for a Sunday roast \u2013 you don\u2019t want to get caught out with mismatching cutlery.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.
