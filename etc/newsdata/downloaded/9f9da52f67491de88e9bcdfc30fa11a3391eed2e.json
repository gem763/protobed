After having a few days to digest the situation, I realize that something that occurred in a split second spiraled out of control with no way to stop it.\n\n'We were both separately surprised to find out that the media had received details of our private situation without our knowledge.'\n\nJim suggests that the pair were both shouldering a lot and that with more time, 'most of our issues could have been worked out.'\n\n'With our busy careers and the addition of our son\u2019s medical needs, we were lacking quality time together,' he wrote.\n\n'I\u2019m removing myself and all of my family from this unnecessary publicity that I obviously have never quite enjoyed.\n\n'It saddens me tremendously that my wife is hurt. After having a few days to digest the situation, I realize that something that occurred in a split second spiraled out of control with no way to stop it.'\n\nIronically, a lot of the publicity in the last day or two centered on public comments that Jim himself made on social media in response to judgmental fans.\n\nHe continued in his statement: 'I have way too much love for my wife and kids for this to happen and it\u2019s time for us to get back to the private life we used to live. Meghan is a truly special woman who my kids are so fortunate to have as their mother.\n\n'Hoping for some peace, normalcy, and the ability to move forward in a healthy, happy direction for every single person involved.\n\nEnding with an ambiguous vow he concluded: 'I love my family and will make it right again.'\n\nJust one day prior, Jim had insisted his newly estranged wife Meghan King is going to have to start worrying about money, following their nasty split.\n\n'I have way too much love for my wife and kids for this to happen and it\u2019s time for us to get back to the private life we used to live. Meghan is a truly special woman who my kids are so fortunate to have as their mother.' (Meghan pictured with her kids and the nanny who allegedly had an affair with Jim)\n\nHis comments came after a follower wrote: 'Meghan will never have to worry about money!!!! Lol' on the retired baseball player's Instagram post about their divorce.\n\nThe 49-year-old former St Louis Cardinals player responded: 'Yes she will.'\n\nIt is not confirmed if Jim had a pre-nuptial agreement with Meghan, who he married in 2014 and shares three young children with.\n\nHowever a source told Us Weekly Meghan, 35, signed a prenup five years ago.\n\nAnd of course, it seems likely the father of seven would have taken precautions to protect his fortune following his two prior failed marriages.\n\nJim has come out fighting following his split from Meghan, after he filed for divorce on Friday.\n\nHe took to social media on Monday morning to deny all claims of an extramarital affair with the couple's young nanny, one of four the family employed.\n\nIn the spotlight: Jim said he wanted out of the lime light even though a lot of the publicity in the last day or two centered on public comments that Jim himself made on social media in response to judgmental fans\n\nJim accused Meghan of being 'disgusting and irresponsible' and said while 'we all make mistakes, this is not one of those times.'\n\nHe insisted: 'I did not sleep with our nanny. She's not just a nanny, she is someone that we brought into our house and promised to protect and look after while she was in our home. We have been treating and raising this young girl like she is our own child! For someone to accuse me of sleeping with her is not only wrong, it's disgusting and irresponsible.'\n\nHe continued: 'Just because I am an athlete and I was portrayed as a bad person on bravo TV. Doesn't mean I don't have a clue what life is all about. We made a promise to that young girls mom, that We would take care of her and make sure that she was safe while she was in our hands.'\n\nThe former athlete went on to say he would not be standing for the lies and is 'fighting back' to ensure the 'truth' is out there.\n\n'I'm speaking out': Meghan commented about the split in a lengthy blog post on Tuesday\n\nSunday evening Jim took to his Instagram Stories to write: 'They should make a new law where you can be arrested for making false accusations against anyone!'\n\nWhile Jim denies cheating with the 22-year-old nanny, he has previous form for being unfaithful.\n\nJust four months ago Jim, who played in the outfield for the Los Angeles Angels and St. Louis Cardinals, was exposed as sending explicit messages to baseball groupie Jennifer Villegas, while Meghan was pregnant with their twins.\n\nHe even sent a video showing him pleasuring himself the same day Meghan was in hospital preparing to give birth to twins Hart and Hayes.\n\nHe maintains the relationship was never physical.\n\nAs for Meghan, she said she was 'speaking out' in a new Instagram post on Tuesday.\n\nSharing a picture of a flower, the reality star wrote: 'When you're in a dark place, you sometimes tend to think you've been buried. Perhaps you've been planted. Bloom.'\n\nOn her blog she went into their break-up in detail, concluding: 'I am broken for my family. I am buried in despair. I cry at the drop of a hat.\n\n'But I am enduring. I will set an example for my children and I will teach them to love and respect people while also knowing not to condone unethical or wrong behavior. I will facilitate healthy, consistent, and ongoing relationships with their father and with his family despite the hurt I feel from them because my children should not reap the karma of my personal situations.'", "description": "Jim Edmonds is speaking out about his messy divorce from with Meghan King and admitting that the whole thing has gotten 'out of control' according to Us Weekly on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Caitlyn Becker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/18/20389834-0-image-a-13_1572458578206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
