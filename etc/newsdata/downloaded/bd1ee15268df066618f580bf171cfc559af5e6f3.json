Breja\u2019s suit\u2014which claims he was fired for whistleblowing and objecting to the company\u2019s conduct\u2014also alleges Juul sold pods that were almost a year old. Breja claims that when he advised then-CEO Kevin Burns against selling the old products, Burns replied, \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: This is another in a string of bad headlines for Juul. The company pulled much of its product in the U.S. earlier this month in anticipation of sweeping bans on flavoured vaping products. It also plans to lay off between 10 and 15 per cent of its workforce\u2014about 500 people\u2014to focus on regulatory compliance rather than marketing. Despite the popularity of Juul\u2019s products\u2014its products account for about 75 per cent of the U.S. e-cigarette market\u2014\u2014it has largely avoided blame for the rise in vaping related illnesses in the U.S., with health officials pointing instead to THC-containing products and devices bought on the black market. But this suit calls into question the company\u2019s quality control at a time when regulators are on high alert for what exactly is causing vapers to get sick.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
