The lawsuit is over whether the British government may share evidence with the United States without an assurance that American prosecutors will not seek the death penalty.\n\nThe American military was taking the men to Iraq, where the United States has a base where it has held Islamic State detainees with American citizenship before transferring them to domestic soil \u2014 or, in one case, releasing a detainee in Bahrain.\n\nIt is not clear how long the two British men will stay at that base. The Justice Department has been reluctant to take custody of them and enter them into the criminal justice system \u2014 where, among other things, they will have a right to a speedy trial \u2014 until it secures the evidence still in British hands that can help support their eventual prosecution.\n\nThe British government has shared witness statements about the two men with the Justice Department, but testimony from British government officials would also probably be necessary at any trial. Mr. Elsheikh\u2019s mother has filed a lawsuit seeking to block such cooperation because the United States government has not promised it will not seek to execute her son. Britain has abolished the death penalty.\n\nBecause of their role in abusing Americans, the two British men were at the top of a list of ISIS detainees of concern for the American government, officials said. But that list has more than five dozen names on it, including a dozen or so other Islamic State prisoners in Kurdish hands who are considered particularly dangerous.", "description": "The military took the two men out of a wartime prison in Syria run by a Kurdish-led militia as Turkey invaded the region.", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/politics/09dc-beatles/09dc-beatles-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
