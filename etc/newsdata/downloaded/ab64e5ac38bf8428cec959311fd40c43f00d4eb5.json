Retailers like H&M and Zara churn out affordable versions of the latest fashions from the runway to the store shelf, and we\u2019re pressured to keep up with the trends.\n\nAnd while there is an increased awareness of poor labour conditions in some of these fast fashion factories, we\u2019re still not talking seriously about how the industry is harming our planet. Fashion is thought to be one of the worst-polluting industries in the world, falling among the ranks of oil and coal.\n\nFashion\u2019s Dirty Secrets, a documentary from The Passionate Eye, highlights the environmental impact of what we wear. Host Stacey Dooley travels to Kazakhstan to examine how growing cotton has literally dried up the Aral Sea and visits Indonesia, where textile factories pump out toxic chemicals into what\u2019s been called the world\u2019s most polluted river.\n\n\u201cWe are producing over 100 billion new garments from new fibres every single year,\u201d says Lucy Siegle, a journalist investigating fashion\u2019s growing environmental footprint. \u201cAnd the planet cannot sustain that.\u201d\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t grow cotton (one of the world\u2019s thirstiest crops) in Canada, nor are we home to the world\u2019s most toxic textile factories, we\u2019re still contributors to the global problem through how much we buy and throw away.\n\nIn 2007, Kelly Drennan founded Fashion Takes Action, the only non-profit organization in Canada focused on promoting sustainability in the fashion industry and among consumers. \u201cWe started as a fundraiser event to demonstrate the potential that sustainable fabrics can be used in high-end fashion, but we quickly realized that an organization was needed to promote the sustainable fashion movement.\u201d\n\nWorking toward sustainable manufacturing\n\nSome of the biggest brand names in fast fashion have received criticism for their lack of sustainability, but Drennan notes there is work being done behind the scenes.\n\nAfter the Rana Plaza collapse in 2013, it became apparent that companies (including Joe Fresh) had no idea how bad things were that factory where their garments were being made. \u201cIn the aftermath, there was a sudden rush to better understand their supply chains, and more pressure is being put on\n\nfashion brands to be more transparent,\u201d says Drennan.\n\n\u201cIt might seem like there isn\u2019t a lot of movement by big brands toward sustainability, but that\u2019s because many of them are still trying to figure out how to trace their supply chains,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can\u2019t be transparent and \u2018show\u2019 us what they\u2019re doing if they don\u2019t first know themselves.\u201d\n\nToday, brands are developing new technologies. Blockchain and RFID (radio frequency identification) tagging systems could be used track materials through a brand\u2019s supply chain so garments can be traced from field to shelf, but these systems are still a work in progress.\n\nResponsible brands and manufacturers are looking to other textiles which are more environmentally friendly than cotton. \u201cWe\u2019re heading toward a global fibre gap, where the demand for fibres \u2014 especially cotton \u2014 in textiles will be too great. Hemp is an attractive alternative as it\u2019s a renewable resource, requires very few pesticides and does not shed microfibres like synthetics do and is much more efficient to grow than cotton.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, each household throws away 46kg of clothing per year, with around 8-12 per cent of municipal landfills made up of textiles.\n\nLandfills are overflowing with our fashion waste\n\nWe\u2019ve become addicted to low-cost, disposable fashion. Compared to two decades ago, we purchase 400 per cent more clothing per year. And eventually, much of that fast fashion ends up in the trash.\n\nIn Canada, each household throws away 46 kilograms of textiles per year on average, making up around eight to 12 per cent of municipal landfills. \u201cUnfortunately, fast fashion is not going away, and if we continue to consume as much clothing as we do today, that means we\u2019ll continue to have fashion waste,\u201d says Drennan.\n\nThe Ontario Textile Conversion Collaborative is finding ways to combat waste by creating new uses for old clothing. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep sending bales of unwanted clothing to developing countries,\u201d says Drennan, \u201cso we\u2019re consulting with a number of manufacturing sectors like the automotive, carpeting, paper, insulation and building sectors to better understand these potential end markets for discarded textiles.\u201d\n\nSome of the biggest brands have launched campaigns in an attempt to address textile waste, and while the issue can\u2019t be fixed overnight, steps are being made. \u201cPerfection doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d says Drennan, \u201cbut progress does!\u201d\n\nHer advice? Donate everything \u2014 even those old pairs of underwear and socks can be passed on at thrift stores and donation bins. Even though they won\u2019t be resold, like 60 to 70 per cent of donations, they can be diverted to other industries that might use the fibres for other purposes such as insulation, padding and stuffing. So next time you\u2019re clearing out your closet, donate it all!\n\nWe need to shop a lot less\n\nGetting ahead of the waste problem involves changing consumer behaviour, and more responsible consumerism is exactly what inspired writer and illustrator Sarah Lazarovic. After finding herself buying too many fashion items on impulse, only to be worn once or twice, Lazarovic decided to take a year-long shopping sabbatical.\n\nGetting in the way of impulse buys was key to her success. \u201cStopping to think \u2018Do I really need this?\u2019 was the first step to reducing my purchases,\u201d says Lazarovic. \u201cMy method was then to paint, instead of purchase, the items that caught my eye.\u201d\n\nLazarovic published her images in a book called A Bunch of Pretty Things I Did Not Buy. Some of her designs have reached a large audience, like \u201cThe Buyerarchy of Needs,\u201d which has been translated into multiple languages. Today, she continues to advocate for changing our consumption behaviour.\n\nHer advice to change shopping habits? \u201cBe methodical about it,\u201d she says. \u201cTake a photo; write it down; say to yourself, \u2018It\u2019s an irrational purchase.\u2019 Take a day, a week or more, and research the item. If you still want it after that time, then, by all means, go for it. But you\u2019ve deferred that impulse, more often than not, you won\u2019t be as interested after a period of time.\u201d\n\nTry not to get sucked in by the \u201climited-time offer\u201d or the literal ticking clock on some online sales. And when it comes to physical retailers, there\u2019s an even simpler solution, says Lazarovic: \u201cDon\u2019t go into the store! Don\u2019t even look!\u201d\n\nClothing manufacturers are starting to focus on sustainability\n\nSome forward-thinking, and even high fashion companies are getting creative about sustainability. Ann Taylor is developing a clothing rental program, instilling the sense of a sharing economy, while Eileen Fisher is introducing a take-back initiative, cleaning and reselling used clothing at a reduced rate.\n\nEven some of fast fashion\u2019s biggest culprits are making headway. H&M, for instance, has created the Global Change Award through the non-profit H&M Foundation, investing in startups that aim to innovate and make the entire fashion industry more sustainable.\n\n\u201cThere will be a huge shift, and we\u2019re just beginning to see the dawn of this change,\u201d says Drennan. \u201cThose brands that don\u2019t get on board with sustainability are going to be left in the dust.\u201d\n\nWatch Fashion\u2019s Dirty Secrets on The Passionate Eye.", "description": "How do we reduce the environmental impact of fashion when we buy 400% more clothing than we used to?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbc.ca/passionateeye/content/images/episodes/FashionWaste_1920.jpg"}
