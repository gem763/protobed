That would force many international investors to get rid of their South African government bonds, leading to large outflows from the country and downward pressure on the .\n\n\"The South African rand is selling off despite the broader risk-on move today in the EM space. This is partly due to headlines of accurate forecaster Renaissance Capital predicting Moody\u2019s will downgrade South Africa\u2019s sovereign credit rating to junk status,\" says Simon Harvey, an analyst at Monex Europe. \"Factors to watch out for include the proposed Eskom announcement prior to the medium-term budget report at the end of the month, and the Moody\u2019s rating decision in November.\"\n\nHarvey and the Monex team say the threat of a downgrade from Moody's and risks to the economy could keep the Rand on the back foot for a while yet but London-based foreign exchange specialist is forecasting recovery before year-end. Monex is looking for the rate to retreat back to 15 in the next month and for it to hit 14.5 by year-end. The Brexit-stricken Pound-to-Rand, on the other hand, is tipped only to 18.41 by the end of December.\n\nUSD/ZAR shown at hourly intervals\n\nAbove: shown at hourly intervals, alongside Pound-to-Rand rate (orange line, left axis).\n\nMarket concerns over the public finances, as well as the ebb and flow of so-far insufficient efforts to improve them, have long weighed on the . South Africa has wracked up debts that risk becoming unaffordable and with the economy weakened by domestic as well as international factors, and the government still running a budget deficit, fears for the rating are growing.\n\n\"The next month will prove tricky as investors await the outcomes of Eskom\u2019s special report, the Medium-Term Budget policy statement and Moody\u2019s sovereign-ratings review. Arguably, much of the uncertainty related to these events is already priced into local assets. But varying interest in weekly bond auctions would suggest that investors are still applying some measure of caution,\" says Nema Rhamkhelawan-Bhana at Merchant Bank.\n\nRenaissance says South Africa's economic condition, alongside social factors complicating the path to reform, are inconsistent with the country retaining its last remaining investment grade rating. However, a majority of analysts polled by Bloomberg this month said they expect the country to keep the rating. For its part, Moodys (NYSE: ) has blown hot and cold in its outlook for South Africa.\n\nPound-to-Rand rate shown at daily intervals\n\nAbove: Pound-to-Rand rate shown at daily intervals, alongside (orange line, left axis).\n\nMoody's marked down South Africa's most recent budget statement in February and followed up with another critical appraisal of the public finances in May, before panning in July, a government plan to provide fresh financial support to the ailing power utility Eskom. The government is on the hook for more than Rs 350 (\u00a320 bn) of debt and is under pressure to offload the company and its problems onto the shoulders of private investors.\n\n\"The upcoming MTBPS (or Medium-term budget policy statement) is being seen to cast a pall over the rand\u2019s fortunes, as is a potential Moody\u2019s country review with possibly rating action on the SA sovereign\u2019s perceived credit worthiness. However, we continue to expect only a downgrade to the rating outlook this year, or in H1.20,\" says Annabel Bishop, chief economist at Investec Bank. \"The domestic currency may still attempt to break through R15.00/USD in the run-up to the FOMC meeting at the end of this month if risk aversion subsides.\"\n\nDespite all its past comments on the public finances, Moody's signalled at a 'Sub-Saharan Africa summit' organized by itself in Johannesburg in early September that it could give the country a stay of execution next month. Lucie Villa, the agency\u2019s vice president and lead sovereign analyst, was reported to have told attendees that the current 'stable' outlook on the rating means there's only a very low probability of a downgrade happening imminently.\n\nVilla said Moody's prefers to the downgrade countries' outlooks to negative before actually cutting the rating, and told eENCA South Africa is \"likely\" to keep the rating the this year. That could mean Tuesday's sell-off is unwound over the coming days and weeks, supporting both Monex and Investec forecasts.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Pound Sterling Live (James Skinner) covering: USD/ZAR, GBP/ZAR, Moodys Corporation.
