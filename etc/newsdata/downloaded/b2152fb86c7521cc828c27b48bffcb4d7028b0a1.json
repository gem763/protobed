So we will look at all the options that are available to us. We will make a decision at the right time.\"\n\nHe added: \"Appeasement has not worked with Iran in the past, appeasement will not work with Iran in the future.\"\n\nThe US re-imposed economic sanctions against Iran last year after abandoning a 2015 nuclear deal, and in May said it would attempt to force all countries to stop buying Iranian oil and put pressure on Iran to negotiate a new nuclear accord.\n\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the UN that the US wanted \"a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran\".\n\n\"In the end, it'll be up to the Iranians to make that decision, or whether they'll choose violence and hate,\" he added.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had attempted to broker an historic meeting between Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and US President Donald Trump.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has refused to meet Donald Trump while sanctions are being imposed\n\nBut Mr Rouhani told delegates at the UN that he refused to meet Mr Trump while the country's punishing economic sanctions were in place. He cast doubt on US intentions, referring to Mr Pompeo's boast last year that it had imposed \"the strongest sanctions in history\" on Iran.\n\n\"How can someone believe them when the silent killing of a great nation, and pressure on the lives of 83 million Iranians, especially women and children, are welcomed by American government officials?\" he said. \"The Iranian nation will never, ever forget and forgive these crimes and these criminals.\"\n\nHe also dismissed the idea of a photo with President Trump, who has staged several photo opportunities with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - including one apparently spontaneous handshake in the Korean peninsula's Demilitarised Zone (DMZ).\n\n\"Memento photos are the final stage of negotiations, not the first one,\" Mr Rouhani said.", "description": "The kingdom maintains that Iran was behind drone attacks on two of its oil installations this month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pcbvq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
