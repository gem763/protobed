New England Patriots (6-0) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 1\n\nThe defense continues to do the heavy lifting while the offense finds its way. Is that sustainable? Don\u2019t wager against Coach Bill Belichick and QB Tom Brady finding a way to make things function better on offense. If that happens, a run at an unblemished season isn\u2019t out of the question.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. New Orleans Saints (5-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 2\n\nThe offense wasn\u2019t great in the triumph at Jacksonville but fill-in QB Teddy Bridgewater continues to find a way to get things done in the absence of Drew Brees. The Saints at full strength will be as good as anyone in the NFC. But can they avoid the sort of playoff misfortune that has ended their last two seasons in astonishing fashion?\n\n3. San Francisco 49ers (5-0) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 4\n\nThe defense is overpowering and the 49ers absolutely are for real. They leapfrog the Seahawks in the rankings after the victory over the Rams. It\u2019s time to start regarding the Niners as a Super Bowl possibility in a field of NFC contenders lacking a true front-runner.\n\nAD\n\n4. Seattle Seahawks (5-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 3\n\nRussell Wilson might be the MVP favorite at the moment and the Seahawks\u2019 tough triumph at Cleveland keeps them in the thick of the chase for NFC supremacy.\n\nAD\n\n5. Green Bay Packers (5-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 5\n\nThe Packers nearly ran out of wide receivers and had plenty of blunders Monday night at Lambeau Field but managed to find a way to beat the Lions, aided by a few erroneous calls that went against Detroit.\n\n6. Houston Texans (4-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 11\n\nThe win over the Chiefs was huge. QB Deshaun Watson is an MVP candidate, and the Texans are a legitimate contender in the AFC.\n\n7. Buffalo Bills (4-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 8\n\nAD\n\nThe Bills return from their bye to play three straight home games, including meetings with the winless Dolphins and one-victory Redskins.\n\n8. Baltimore Ravens (4-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 9\n\nQB Lamar Jackson\u2019s 19-carry, 152-yard rushing performance against the Bengals was both spectacular and concerning. What Jackson can do is amazing. But shouldn\u2019t the Ravens be past the point at which they have to put their new franchise QB in such peril to beat a winless team?\n\nAD\n\n9. Carolina Panthers (4-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 12\n\nThere\u2019s no avoiding it now. Coach Ron Rivera has a legitimate QB issue on his hands. The Panthers weren\u2019t winning when Cam Newton was playing. They are winning with Kyle Allen in the lineup. Newton is a former MVP and the face of the franchise. But should he get his starting job back when his mid-foot sprain is sufficiently healed? It would be tough to sit Allen any time soon.\n\nAD\n\n10. Indianapolis Colts (3-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 10\n\nThe Colts return from their bye and could welcome back LB Darius Leonard, the league\u2019s leading tackler last season as a rookie. He has missed three games because of a concussion but announced on social media last week that he\u2019d been cleared by doctors to return.\n\n11. Minnesota Vikings (4-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 18\n\nQB Kirk Cousins wasn\u2019t the weak link against the Eagles that Zach Brown predicted. Cousins finally got WR Stefon Diggs involved in the Vikings\u2019 offense to perhaps quiet all the trade speculation about Diggs. But the Vikings shouldn\u2019t gloat too much. Cousins still has to show that he can get it done in bigger games against the better teams.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (4-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 7\n\nThe return of speedy WR Tyreek Hill to the lineup gave the Kansas City offense a big-play boost against the Texans. But there are issues right now, and no one seems particularly afraid to face the Chiefs at this point.\n\n13. Philadelphia Eagles (3-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 6\n\nCan anyone in the NFC East actually play? The Eagles and Cowboys are supposed to be Super Bowl contenders. At the moment, both look thoroughly mediocre entering their meeting Sunday night in Dallas.\n\n14. Oakland Raiders (3-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 15\n\nThe Raiders expressed their displeasure that LB Vontaze Burfict was suspended by the NFL for the rest of the season. But they shouldn\u2019t have felt as if they and Burfict, whose appeal was denied by a neutral arbitrator, were treated unfairly. Burfict\u2019s long history of illegal hits had put him in jeopardy of an increased penalty for his next infraction, and the Raiders should have kept that in mind when they signed him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n15. Chicago Bears (3-2) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 16\n\nThe Bears, while on their bye week, had plenty of time to sit and watch Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson, the QBs they bypassed to draft Mitchell Trubisky, square off Sunday.\n\n16. Los Angeles Rams (3-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 13\n\nThis is the first true crisis of Sean McVay\u2019s head coaching tenure. The Rams clearly are only the third-best team in the NFC West at the moment, and McVay must figure out how to steady his team and end its spiral.\n\n17. Dallas Cowboys (3-3) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 14\n\nOwner Jerry Jones is not getting the results he expected when he handed out all those big-money contracts. When the Cowboys were 3-0, they looked like the team to beat in the entire NFC and QB Dak Prescott resembled an MVP candidate. It all has fallen apart very quickly and the entire NFC East is in retreat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n18. Detroit Lions (2-2-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 17\n\nYes, the Lions were victimized by ill-timed officiating mistakes Monday night at Green Bay. But when you kick five field goals instead of getting touchdowns, you don\u2019t get to blame the officials entirely.\n\n19. Denver Broncos (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 25\n\nThe Broncos have won two straight following their 0-4 start and finally are playing the kind of defense they were expected to play after hiring Vic Fangio as their coach.\n\n20. Pittsburgh Steelers (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 27\n\nThe Steelers got a win Sunday night with No. 3 QB Devlin Hodges, after getting a win earlier with No. 2 QB Mason Rudolph. Mike Tomlin actually is doing a very good coaching job, even if the Steelers don\u2019t end up turning around their season and getting back into playoff contention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n21. Cleveland Browns (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 19\n\nThe Browns simply are not the \u201cit\u201d team that they were back in the offseason, when things looked so much better on paper than they have turned out to be in reality. QB Baker Mayfield\u2019s second NFL season has been an up-and-down experience, and General Manager John Dorsey is even having to try to quiet speculation that he would consider trading WR Odell Beckham Jr.\n\n22. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 20\n\nThere have been days this season when it appeared that QB Jameis Winston was making progress with Bruce Arians as his coach. Sunday was not one of those days, as Winston had six turnovers and took seven sacks in the loss to the Panthers in London.\n\n23. New York Giants (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 22\n\nThe Giants kept things interesting and competitive against the Patriots most of the way Thursday night. The Giants are a different team with rookie Daniel Jones at QB, even with the mistakes he made against the powerful New England defense. They\u2019re only a game out of first place in the NFC East and they could be a factor in the race, given how the Cowboys and Eagles are underachieving.\n\nAD\n\n24. Arizona Cardinals (2-3-1) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 26\n\nRookie QB Kyler Murray was superb in the victory over the Falcons. There have been the typical rookie-year ups and downs for Murray, but there\u2019s no question that he has the potential to be a star.\n\n25. New York Jets (1-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 29\n\nThe Jets are not terrible when they have Sam Darnold at QB. That was clear during Sunday\u2019s upset of the Cowboys.\n\n26. Los Angeles Chargers (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 21\n\nThey were supposed to be a top AFC contender this season. And now the Chargers can\u2019t even win at home while facing a rookie third-string QB making his first NFL start. Don\u2019t be fooled by the cosmetic fourth-quarter comeback against the Steelers. By that point, the Chargers had no realistic chance to win that game and they simply aren\u2019t very good right now.\n\n27. Jacksonville Jaguars (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 23\n\nMinshew mania? Maybe not so much any more after rookie QB Gardner Minshew II struggled in the loss to the Saints.\n\n28. Tennessee Titans (2-4) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 24\n\nThe QB switch from Marcus Mariota to Ryan Tannehill was justified. But is there any reason to believe that Tannehill will be the answer? Not really.\n\n29. Washington Redskins (1-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 31\n\nThe Redskins got into the win column in Miami after firing Jay Gruden and making Bill Callahan their interim head coach. But, in truth, they didn\u2019t play any better than they had on Gruden\u2019s watch and they were very fortunate to narrowly escape the ultimate embarrassment of losing to a Dolphins team that has been accused of tanking the season.\n\n30. Atlanta Falcons (1-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 28\n\nThe Falcons are in no hurry to get rid of Dan Quinn as their coach. But if the losing doesn\u2019t stop, they might have no choice eventually.\n\n31. Cincinnati Bengals (0-6) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 30\n\nThe Bengals are somehow managing to keep the pressure on the Dolphins in the race to the bottom of the league.\n\n32. Miami Dolphins (0-5) | Last Week\u2019s Rank: 32\n\nCoach Brian Flores\u2019s decision to go for two points and the win against the Redskins was fine. But the play that the Dolphins drew up for their two-point conversion attempt had absolutely no chance to succeed.", "description": "The Niners\u2019 win over the Rams moves them up into the No. 3 spot, just ahead of the Seahawks.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PzzqtSrk7UEs2Y0Er3A2HzDGg50=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6XCDNQHOLMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
