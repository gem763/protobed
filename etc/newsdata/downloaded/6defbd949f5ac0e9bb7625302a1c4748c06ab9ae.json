They have also started straightening out Portugal's ill-managed public finances.\n\nThe main opposition Social Democrats party is still associated with the deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, when the center-right party was in power.\n\nRecent opinion polls have indicated that the Socialists will fall short of a majority in parliament.
