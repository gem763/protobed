But the intercepting player took off running for the wrong end zone. That was when Fairfield player Kha-Ron Thrower had to take matters into his own hands to stop his teammate from running into an embarrassing safety.\n\nThrower ran 50 yards to bring down his teammate at the 10-yard line with a clutch tackle. As he pointed out, it was a Not Top Play and a Top Play all into one.\n\nOH NO.\n\nYou can even see the Fairfield players pointing at the correct end zone, but props to Thrower for the heads-up effort to tackle his own teammate.\n\nIt was the player's first interception too. He just got turned around and didn't realize that he was going the wrong way.\n\nThat was lil bro first interception noted that he\u2019s only played 2.5 games do to injury going into that game and that was his first game back off another injury so I don\u2019t really blame him and that had nothing to do with us losing, lil bro fine and he\u2019ll bounce back \ud83d\udda4\u00ae@ohnoitsab \u2014 Kha\u2019Ron Thrower4 (@SGAndre1) October 13, 2019\n\nAs big as that tackle was, Fairfield would lose, 14-7. The team is 0-7 on the season.", "description": "The intercepting player took off for the wrong end zone.
