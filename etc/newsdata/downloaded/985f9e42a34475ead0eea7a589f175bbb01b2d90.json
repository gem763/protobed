Even that would be at risk if the government determined children were attracted to it or that it was being marketed to them, Azar said.\n\nThe move is the most sweeping action yet by the U.S. government to crack down on what it has called an \"epidemic\" of youth e-cigarette usage.\n\nThe FDA in March formally proposed guidelines that would prohibit the sale of flavored e-cigarette products, except mint and menthol, in traditional retail outlets. Under that proposal, which had not been finalized, e-cigarette makers could still sell flavored products online and in age-restricted stores, such as vape shops.\n\nWednesday\u2019s proposal goes much further, banning the sale of all flavored e-cigarette products across all retail channels, aside from tobacco-flavored products.\n\nDespite the increased public attention around teenage e-cigarette use over the last year, HHS on Wednesday pointed to data showing that the problem has worsened. Preliminary data shows more than a quarter of U.S. high school students used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. That is up from 20.8% last year and 11.7% in 2017.\n\nSix deaths have been linked to vaping and U.S. public health officials are investigating 450 cases of potential vaping-related lung illness across 33 states and one U.S. territory. Health officials have cited patients\u2019 use of cannabis liquids in many, though not all, of those cases, some of which only involved nicotine vaping.\n\n\"We have a problem in our country, it's a new problem ... and it's called vaping, especially vaping as it pertains to innocent children,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"There have been deaths and there have been a lot of other problems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSURGE IN USE BY ADOLESCENTS\n\nJuul Labs Inc, which dominates the U.S. e-cigarette market, has faced withering criticism over the last two years after becoming wildly popular among teenagers. The company has taken steps to try to reduce its appeal among youth, including pulling flavors except mint and menthol from traditional retail stores, suspending its social media accounts and toughening age verification online.\n\nIn December, Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc made a $12.8 billion investment in Juul, taking a 35% stake.\n\nJuul spokesman Ted Kwong said \"we strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products,\" adding the company \"will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective.\"\n\nA spokesman for Imperial Brands Plc, which sells the Blu line of e-cigarettes, declined to comment.\n\nKaelan Hollon, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co , which sells Vuse e-cigarettes in the United States, did not directly address the proposed flavor ban but said the company shares the administration's goal of keeping products away from youth.\n\nWednesday's move by the White House comes after more than a year of mounting pressure from lawmakers, public health advocates and parents looking to end marketing of products aimed at youth.", "description": "WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration announced plans on Wednesday to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves in a widening crackdown on vaping, as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.
