These maps are unlike Google Maps or Waze. Instead, they include topographical features such as lane merges, shared turn lanes and curb heights, as well as road types and the distance and dimensions of the road itself, according to Waymo. That data is combined with traffic control information like signs, the lengths of crosswalks and the locations of traffic lights.\n\nStarting this week, Angelenos might catch a glimpse of Waymo\u2019s cars on the streets of LA! Our cars will be in town exploring how Waymo's tech might fit into LA\u2019s dynamic transportation environment and complement the City\u2019s innovative approach to transportation. pic.twitter.com/REHfxrxqdL \u2014 Waymo (@Waymo) October 7, 2019\n\nWaymo does have a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California and could theoretically deploy its fleet in Los Angeles. But for now, the company is in mapping and assessment mode. Waymo\u2019s foray into Los Angeles is designed to give the company insight into driving conditions there and how its AV technology might someday be used.\n\nThe company said it doesn\u2019t plan to launch a rider program like its Waymo One currently operating in the suburbs of Phoenix. Waymo One allows individuals to hail a ride in one of the self-driving cars, which have a human safety driver behind the wheel.\n\nThe self-driving car company began testing its autonomous vehicles in and around Mountain View, Calif., before branching out to other cities \u2014 and climates \u2014 including Novi, Mich., Kirkland, Wash., San Francisco and, more recently, in Florida. But the bulk of the company\u2019s activities have been in the suburbs of Phoenix and around Mountain View \u2014 two places with lots of sun, and even blowing dust, in the case of Phoenix.", "description": "Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company under Alphabet, has started creating 3D maps in some heavily trafficked sections of Los Angeles to better understand congestion there and determine if its self-driving vehicles would be a good fit in the city.
