(Picture: Instagram)\n\n\u2018If I didn\u2019t love this dance, it would have been impossible. Impossible to learn, to practice or to perform at this level of intensity. It was challenging physically, mentally, even emotionally,\u2019 he later shared after his performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But the choreography by the incredible @theemmaslater gave me so much to commit to as an actor\u2026 and we worked hard. Really hard.\n\n\u2018And it was worth it. Most fun I\u2019ve had on this show to date. And that\u2019s saying something. Still buzzing. I will be for some time.\u2019\n\nJames and his wife Kimberley revealed on last week\u2019s episode of the hit dancing show that they are expecting their sixth child, after several devastating miscarriages.\n\nSpeaking to People magazine after his performance on Monday, he admitted that \u2018Kimberly decided to do it on camera, to open it up and allow people to go through the experience \u2014 good result or not good result\u2019.\n\nJames and his wife Kimberley revealed on last week\u2019s episode of the hit dancing show that they are expecting their sixth child (Picture: Instagram)\n\n\u2018The only advice I have is that you can\u2019t reason your way out of it and you can\u2019t talk your way out of it,\u2019 he said, speaking to others who may be going through the same as him and Kimberley.\n\n\u2018You just have to let yourself go through it and go through the journey and be there for each other,\u2019 he concluded.\n\n\u2018Know that you can\u2019t judge the pain, you can\u2019t judge the process. For us, thankfully, we also have three rainbow babies. It\u2019s life. And also, don\u2019t be afraid to talk about [it].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a weird stigma that might still exist around it \u2026 things like that is when you need your family and friends.\u2019\n\nIf you need support after the death of a baby, please call Sands on 08081643322.\n\n", "description": "James Van Der Beek performed a Pirates Of The Carribean dance on Dancing With The Stars.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JAMESVANDERBEEK-COMP2-73b1_1571130009.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
