The university is rated among India\u2019s best, and it\u2019s no coincidence that it has so far avoided herding its students into hostels or out of campus by sunset, as is the norm with many small town institutions. Rankings of our higher educational institutes sink lower according to international assessments, and radical educational reforms are the need of the hour. Instead, authorities want to step back in time and are obsessed with policing nocturnal activities of students \u2013 who after all are adults with the right to vote.\n\nWhile we fight 19th century battles, China has recently broken into a power list of the world\u2019s top ten countries based on the number of universities ranked among the top 200. Meanwhile, JNU is in the news for all the wrong reasons like notices issued to 48 faculty members including senior professors carrying the threat of dismissal, demanding eminent historian Romila Thapar\u2019s CV to extend her emeritus professorship, and a proposal to make learning of Hindi mandatory in undergraduate courses.\n\nThe Left\u2019s stranglehold over JNU has been a sore point for BJP. But the right-wing dispensation has taken a fundamentally wrong approach to meeting this ideological challenge. It should promote high quality scholarship to break up ideological monopolies, not treat grown men and women like schoolchildren. It can turn its attention to reforming Indian universities fossilised by socialist-era statist structures like UGC. Public universities need more functional autonomy, better funding models, and higher academic standards from faculty and students. In contrast, the blunt force model being pioneered at JNU will dumb down education further.", "description": "Proposed amendments to Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University hostel manual that will institute a 11 pm curfew, bar on visitors after 10.30 pm and on guests of opposite sexes in hostel rooms, and penalties like eviction...", "authors": ["Toi Edit"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/toiedit-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
