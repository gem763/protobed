In June, Trump himself warned that abandoning the alliance would allow Turkey to \u201cwipe out the Kurds, who helped us with ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe backlash from his Republican allies was swift.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), led the way on Monday morning, with the South Carolina senator calling the move \u201cshortsighted and irresponsible\u201d on Fox & Friends, a show that effectively serves as a televised presidential daily brief for Trump.\n\n\u201cThis impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we\u2019ve made, thrown the region into further chaos, Iran is licking their chops, and if I\u2019m an ISIS fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI will do everything I can to sanction Turkey\u2019s military and their economy if they step one foot into Syria. I hope I\u2019m making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is.\u201d\n\nGraham even referenced the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, unprompted, before adding that while \u201cI\u2019ve tried to help him,\u201d the president\u2019s behavior was \u201cjust unnerving to its core.\u201d\n\nGraham, who has spent years trying to steer Trump closer to the hawkish foreign policy stances held by his Republican predecessors, opened the floodgates for Republicans who see Trump\u2019s move as a threat to a critical U.S. ally in the region, and a potentially disastrous embrace of an autocratic regime.\n\nIndeed, Monday saw widespread pushback from around the Senate GOP, from lawmakers who\u2019ve cozied up to Trump to those who have been more willing to call him out. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a Trump ally who has nudged him toward more hawkish positions on Venezuela and Iran policy, called the decision \u201ca grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.\u201d Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) said that he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the decision could leave Kurds who risked their lives to fight ISIS in harm\u2019s way.\n\nAnd Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), probably Trump\u2019s most vocal Senate GOP critic, characterized the pullout as \u201ca betrayal\u201d that \u201cpresages another humanitarian disaster\u201d in Syria. Romney went so far as to join Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) to demand that administration officials explain their move to lawmakers and the public. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE), meanwhile, has toned down his Trump criticism lately but warned that the retreat would \u201clikely result in the slaughter of allies who fought with us, including women and children.\u201d\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME) managed to subtweet the president, calling Trump\u2019s move \u201ca terribly unwise decision\u201d moments after the president described his wisdom on the matter as \u201cgreat and unmatched.\u201d\n\nEven Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a rare rebuke of the president whom he has pledged to protect from removal from office, pleaded with Trump to maintain an American presence in the region and to prevent Turkey from invading.\n\n\u201cI urge the president to exercise American leadership to keep together our multinational coalition to defeat ISIS and prevent significant conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian counterterrorism partners,\u201d McConnell said in a statement.\n\nMajor new conflict between Turkey and our partners in Syria, McConnell said, \u201cwould seriously risk damaging Turkey\u2019s ties to the United States and causing greater isolation for Turkey on the world stage.\u201d\n\nAmong Trump\u2019s allies seeking to thread the needle between opposing the withdrawal and ensuring that the president didn\u2019t feel attacked was Sen. Ted Cruz, who tweeted that while Trump was \u201cright to want to bring our soldiers home,\u201d it would be \u201cDISGRACEFUL\u201d (capital letters Cruz\u2019s) to allow Turkey to attack Kurdish allies in the region.\n\n\u201cOur enemies and rivals (Iran, Russia, etc.) don\u2019t abandon their allies,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf we want allies to stand with America in the future, we shouldn\u2019t either. Honorable nations stand by their friends.\u201d\n\nSeemingly alone among Senate Republicans in supporting the withdrawal was Sen. Rand Paul, who is perhaps the biggest cheerleader of Trump\u2019s isolationist instincts. The Kentucky senator told reporters that he stands with Trump \u201cas he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy.\u201d\n\nOther Senate Republicans have remained tight-lipped on the president\u2019s decision, perhaps praying that Trump will reverse course on the withdrawal\u2014as he did in December 2018, after sharp rebukes from within the party and the resignation of Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis halted a hastily announced drawdown of U.S. troops from Syria.\n\nAsked during an event celebrating a trade agreement with Japan on Monday afternoon about whether he had consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the decision, Trump insisted that he had.\n\n\u201cI consulted with everybody,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAdditional reporting: Sam Brodey", "description": "\u201cI\u2019ve tried to help him,\u201d Sen.
