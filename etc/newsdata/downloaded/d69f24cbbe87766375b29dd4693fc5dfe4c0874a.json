Last fall, the Annunciation of \u201cThe Testaments\u201d was heralded around the world. In August, blessed reviewers received preview copies printed with a false title and author, lest the book\u2019s revelations slip preemptively into the wrong hands. A week before the novel was published, it was already shortlisted for the Booker Prize. And on Sept. 10, Atwood\u2019s sold-out, publication-day appearance at the National Theatre in London will be live broadcast to 1,300 cinemas from Canada to Malta.\n\nBlessed be the fruit!\n\nA confluence of political and cultural forces has made \u201cThe Testaments\u201d as vital as a baby in Gilead. First, the election of President Trump cattle-prodded \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d back up the bestseller list. Then Hulu\u2019s adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss inspired millions more to care about the plight of the fertile few. And now that our reproductive freedom hangs on the frail health of a single 86-year-old Supreme Court justice, red-cloaked Handmaids have swarmed capitols across the country. Consequently, the terrain of Gilead is probably more familiar to Americans than the geography of the United States.\n\nFans of Atwood\u2019s dystopian classic will remember that Offred, the narrator of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d concluded her secret testimony by acknowledging, \u201cWhether this is my end or a new beginning I have no way of knowing.\u201d\n\nNow we know.\n\n\u201cThe Testaments\u201d opens in Gilead about 15 years after \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d but it\u2019s an entirely different novel in form and tone. Inevitably, the details are less shocking \u2014 at least in part because the horrors of Gilead\u2019s male-centered theocracy are already so well known. When Offred first told her \u201csad and mutilated story,\u201d we were hearing about the hangings, the Unbabies and the Sons of Jacob for the first time. But by now, Gilead\u2019s breeding Ceremony is a creepy cultural touchstone.\n\nAtwood responds to the challenge of that familiarity by giving us the narrator we least expect: Aunt Lydia. It\u2019s a brilliant strategic move that turns the world of Gilead inside out. In \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Aunt Lydia is the orthodox teacher whose platitudes and instructions cycle through Offred\u2019s mind. But in \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d Aunt Lydia speaks directly to us in all her conflicted complexity. She has become the supreme matriarch of this masculine cult. \u201cI control the women\u2019s side of their enterprise with an iron fist in a leather glove in a woolen mitten,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I keep things orderly: like a harem eunuch.\u201d As a living legend, the very model of moral perfection and feminine wisdom, she enjoys a special position of extraordinary power \u2014 and she knows just how precarious that is.\n\n\u201cOnly dead people are allowed to have statues,\u201d she begins, \u201cbut I have been given one while still alive. Already I am petrified.\u201d\n\nThat little pun is typical of Aunt Lydia\u2019s wry wit, which endows \u201cThe Testaments\u201d with far more humor than \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d or its exceedingly grim TV adaptation. This Aunt Lydia is publicly devout but privately defiant, outwardly pious but inwardly sardonic. Her arch irony, even flippancy, provides a markedly different interpretation than Ann Dowd\u2019s terrifying portrayal for Hulu.\n\nWriting in a journal at night in a library forbidden to all but a chosen few, Aunt Lydia reveals the story of her previous life, her traumatizing transition to the Republic of Gilead and her crafty political intrigue. She\u2019s Sun Tzu and Machiavelli with a cup of cinnamon tea. Through a combination of good luck and her own ruthless instincts, she has survived and thrived to become the spider at the center of a vast web of \u201cshameful information\u201d to trap female competitors and intimidate her male superiors. \u201cSome days I see myself as the Recording Angel, collecting together all the sins of Gilead,\u201d she says. \u201cOn other days I shrug off this high moral tone. Am I not, au fond, merely a dealer in sordid gossip?\u201d That\u2019s the genius of Atwood\u2019s creation. Aunt Lydia is a mercurial assassin: a pious leader, a ruthless administrator, a deliciously acerbic confessor. \u201cWhoever said consistency is a virtue?\u201d she asks.\n\n\n\nThe author Margaret Atwood. (Liam Sharp)\n\nBut Aunt Lydia is not the only narrator of \u201cThe Testaments.\u201d Interlaced among her journal entries are the testimonies of two young women: one raised in Gilead, the other in Canada. Their mysterious identities fuel much of the story\u2019s suspense \u2014 and electrify the novel with an extra dose of melodrama. Together, this trio of voices allows Atwood to include broader details about how other countries respond to the Republic of Gilead. Freed from the intense but narrow constraints of Offred\u2019s point of view in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d \u201cThe Testaments\u201d sketches out protest movements abroad, an underground railroad to ferry women north, the internecine conflicts rotting out the center of Gilead, and the Republic\u2019s efforts to manipulate its image on the world stage.\n\n\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d famously ends with the line, \u201cAny questions?\u201d And last November, Atwood told her 1.9 million Twitter followers that \u201cThe Testaments\u201d was inspired by \u201ceverything you\u2019ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings.\u201d That certainly appears to be the case \u2014 the story is full of revealing backstories \u2014 but readers hoping for a complementary classic of dystopian literature may be disappointed. \u201cThe Testaments\u201d is not nearly the devastating satire of political and theological misogyny that \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is. In this new novel, Atwood is far more focused on creating a brisk thriller than she is on exploring the perversity of systemic repression.\n\nBut, of course, that\u2019s not a fair complaint. Although the story of Gilead has long been called to the service of this or that contemporary cause, it remains entirely Atwood\u2019s possession. In the new introduction to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d she even pushes back again on the question of whether it\u2019s a feminist novel: \u201cIf you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels and/or so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no.\u201d That strikes me as a straw-man argument \u2014 nobody defines great feminist fiction that way \u2014 but the fact that Atwood keeps challenging such categories is all part of her extraordinary effort to resist the chains we place on each other.\n\nGilead will never be the same.\n\nPraise be.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.", "description": "\u201cThe Testaments\u201d answers all our burning questions about Gilead.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World", "September At Pm", "Ron Charles Writes About Books For The Washington Post.
