The people I grew up with were fair-minded and grounded by common sense. They have given me the values and traits I\u2019ve carried with me on my life\u2019s journey, and they have inspired and created some of the best music I have ever heard.\u201d\n\nBecause country music is so strongly associated with white working-class people in the South, many of the same stereotypes that reduced impoverished farmers to \u201cOkies\u201d during the Dust Bowl years are still assigned to country music itself. But Mr. Burns takes pains to complicate these expectations, to highlight not just the story of an art form with roots in both slave quarters and mountain cabins but also the moral evolution of some of the genre\u2019s most prominent musicians.\n\nWhen word first got out that Charley Pride is black, many radio stations refused to play Mr. Pride\u2019s record. \u201cYou son of a bitch, you go back there and tell that son of a bitch that manages your station if he takes Charley Pride off,\u201d Faron Young told one of them, \u201ctake all my records off.\u201d It was country star Tom T. Hall who urged Johnny Rodriguez, the young Mexican-American country singer whose manager called him Johnny Rogers, to come to Nashville and reclaim his name. The audience, he said, would come around.\n\nMore than anyone else, Johnny Cash pushed the country music establishment to embrace new artists and enfold new musical forms. Mr. Cash used the platform of his weekly network TV show to celebrate diversity and what his daughter Rosanne Cash calls the \u201cecumenical attitude he had toward all music.\u201d Guests included Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton, the Who, James Taylor, Gordon Lightfoot, Joni Mitchell. When network executives said Pete Seeger was too left-wing for the show, Mr. Cash ignored them. Mr. Seeger appeared anyway.\n\nAs Mr. Burns tells it, musical genres were always cross-pollinating. When Ringo Starr recorded a Buck Owens hit, \u201cAct Naturally,\u201d the Beatles released it as the flip side of \u201cYesterday.\u201d Bob Dylan invited Johnny Cash to play the 1964 Newport Folk Festival and later moved his own recording work to Nashville; the success of \u201cBlonde On Blonde\u201d led a host of other folk and rock artists to Nashville studios, with Nashville session musicians sitting in. And as Willie Nelson observes about the diverse audiences who showed up for his annual Fourth of July concerts in Austin, college students and truck drivers aren\u2019t so different from each other after all: \u201cThey\u2019re out there drinking beer, smoking dope, and finding out that they really don\u2019t hate each other,\u201d he said.\n\nExcept for one ill-fated attempt to move away, I\u2019ve lived in the South my whole life, and all my people are Southerners, but I didn\u2019t grow up listening to country. My parents played only the Big Band music they\u2019d danced to during their courtship, and the second I got my first transistor radio at age 12, I tuned it to \u201970s rock. But as a homesick graduate student in Philadelphia, I found a country station on the radio and fell in love. It gave me what country music has been giving its listeners from the very beginning: a way to feel less alone. That year I gave my parents Willie Nelson\u2019s \u201cStardust\u201d for Christmas.\n\nEvery art form benefits from a gifted teacher, an expert, an evangelist \u2014 someone who can explain to the uninitiated or the skeptical or the heedless that, no, this actually isn\u2019t something their toddler could have made in nursery school. Someone who can convey the context in which the art was created, the hopes of its creators, the way they learned from each other and nudged each other to grow. Someone, above all, who can convince you that you will be better, your life more enriched, if you understand it.\n\nKen Burns, a Brooklyn-born filmmaker, may be an unlikely teacher of country music, but this transcendent documentary, six years in the making, has arrived at a particularly auspicious time. Thinking of Southerners as stupid rednecks and toothless hillbillies has become the last acceptable prejudice in America. Mr. Burns\u2019s comprehensive and nuanced documentary will make for a welcome reconsideration, especially for those who think they understand what country music is (\u201cloving, cheating, hurting, fighting, drinking, pickup trucks and Mother,\u201d as Harold Bradley described the stereotype) and those who think there\u2019s nothing much to understand. As Mr. Havighurst said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for America to see this and rethink what country music means and how it sounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountry Music\u201d will begin airing, on PBS affiliate stations and online, Sunday, Sept. 15. \u201cCountry Music: Live at The Ryman, a Concert Celebrating the Film by Ken Burns\u201d is streaming now.\n\nMargaret Renkl is a contributing opinion writer who covers flora, fauna, politics and culture in the American South.
