REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\n\nDirectors, which include those from top shareholder Renault SA (RENA.PA), will also discuss the future of another Nissan executive, Hari Nada, multiple people said.\n\nNada helped oust former Chairman Carlos Ghosn but has since been hit by allegations of overpayment himself. Renault may back a proposal calling for his exit, a source close to the French automaker said.\n\nNissan and Renault declined to comment. Nada did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations.\n\nThe board discord at Japan\u2019s second-largest carmaker illustrates how the turmoil that followed Ghosn\u2019s downfall last year deepened with the departure of former CEO Hiroto Saikawa last month. Saikawa was forced to step down after he admitted to being improperly overpaid.\n\nThe internal strife also has implications for Nissan\u2019s often difficult relationship with Renault.\n\nTension has since emerged between Masakazu Toyoda, the Princeton-educated former trade ministry official who chairs the nominations committee, and Hitoshi Kawaguchi, who is responsible for external affairs and is seen as having close ties to government, four people familiar with the situation said.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is strained,\u201d said one of the people, all of whom declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Toyoda and another outside director, Motoo Nagai, were against Saikawa\u2019s abrupt resignation last month, given that the board had not yet found a replacement, the person said.\n\nThe Toyoda camp believes that Kawaguchi played a role in helping to set the stage for former CEO Saikawa\u2019s departure, the person said. Kawaguchi is also seen as being supportive of acting chief executive Yasuhiro Yamauchi getting the job on a permanent basis, the person said, adding that Toyoda was cautious about Yamauchi.\n\nFOCUS ON NADA\n\nThe nominations committee is due to meet earlier in the day at Nissan\u2019s Yokohama headquarters, with the board itself due to meet in the afternoon.\n\nNada has come under increasing scrutiny after the New York Times reported on Sunday he had received \u201cunjust enrichment,\u201d citing a review by an external law firm hired by the automaker.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that some Nissan lawyers said that Nada, who oversees Nissan\u2019s legal department and had previously worked closely with Ghosn on sensitive matters, needed to do more to avoid potential conflicts of interest.\n\nA Nissan spokesman declined to comment on both reports.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Nissan logo is seen at Nissan car plant in Sunderland, Britain February 4, 2019. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\n\u201cIf the Nissan board proposes calling for (Nada\u2019s) exit, Renault representatives will probably vote in favor of the proposal,\u201d said the source close to Renault. The French company has a 43.4% stake in Nissan.\n\nReuters reported last month that Saikawa\u2019s fate was sealed by two external directors who persuaded the board to oust the former Ghosn protege and spare the company more reputational damage.\n\nThe race for the CEO job has been narrowed down to a contest between Yamauchi and former Nissan China chief Jun Seki, who are seen as front-runners, although India-born Ashwani Gupta and a possible external candidate remain in the mix, Reuters reported this month.", "description": "The board of Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> will meet on Tuesday as a split has emerged over the scandal-hit automaker's next CEO, putting the head of the nominations committee at odds with an influential executive, people familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Maki Shiraki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438155641&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961B8", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
