If you consider the position in isolation, he is the best No 10 in England with George Ford a very close second.\n\nMany England supporters probably share the same view - and I\u2019ve seen some social media chat this week arguing Farrell is being wasted at No 12 - yet I 100 per cent support Eddie Jones\u2019 decision to play Ford at 10 with Farrell at 12.\n\nOwen Farrell (left) and George Ford (right) are the partnership that unlocks England's backs\n\nIt might seem counter-intuitive but it\u2019s about getting the best out of the team.\n\nEngland will only win the World Cup if the Ford/Farrell combination is allowed to flourish and bring our exciting backs into play, like they did in the warm-up game against Ireland at Twickenham.\n\nThe first-choice midfield - Ford, Farrell and Manu Tuilagi - has been set in stone since Manu\u2019s return to full fitness.\n\nThat playmaker combination brings the best out of England\u2019s strike power, the likes of Elliott Daly, Jonny May and Anthony Watson - and impact players Joe Cokanasiga and Jack Nowell.\n\nGetting that midfield combination right is significantly more important to England\u2019s World Cup hopes than the fitness of Billy Vunipola.\n\nFarrell might not be at his very best at the moment but the team need him to play at No 12\n\nMy thinking is that regardless of Farrell\u2019s ability at 10, he is also the best option at No 12, a position which has haunted England for many years.\n\nFarrell in pure rugby terms is a better 12 than Henry Slade who has barely played in the last five months. Slade has ability but he has run into injury problems at a bad time and, although there have been cameos for England, he has not yet replicated his form for Exeter Chiefs.\n\nSo the equation is simple. Which is the strongest combination to give England a shot at winning the World Cup? Farrell at 10 and Slade at inside centre or Ford at 10 with Farrell at 12? It is the latter every time.\n\nThere are other positives from combining their talents this way. Farrell is now the skipper and goalkicker and therefore much better off at 12 because he is not involved in every decision like he would be at fly-half. It gives him a moment to breathe.\n\nWhen Farrell plays at inside centre England have a far better winning record than at fly-half\n\nHe is also drawing some of the fire and heavy hits that Ford might otherwise cop. It is no coincidence that Farrell has already taken two illegal hits. More big hits will follow.\n\nIf the opposition are fixated on getting Farrell, and trying to provoke a reaction, that allows Ford more time and space. Farrell is hard as nails and will be delighted to draw the flack if it gives Ford a more comfortable ride. He has also kept his cool admirably so far.\n\nW ehaven\u2019t we seen the absolute best from this combination attack-wise so far in Japan but frankly, they haven\u2019t needed to.\n\nEngland have enjoyed a remarkably straightforward progression to the quarter-finals. There has been no need to engage fourth gear. New Zealand, in a considerably weaker group than England, have not engaged top gear either.\n\nFord, reassured by Farrell\u2019s presence, is purring away nicely and deservedly taking the plaudits, Farrell is biding his time. He hasn\u2019t been stellar yet but with four Premiership titles in five years at Sarries and three European Cups, he knows exactly when it\u2019s showtime. He will become a more influential figure as we progress.\n\nGeorge Ford is playing superbly and has more time and space with Farrell drawing defenders\n\nFellow Sarries Jamie George, Maro Itoje, George Kruis and Vunipola have been ticking over rather than taking the tournament by storm. Their big moments are coming.\n\nFarrell will be working hard on his goal-kicking after missing his opening four shots against the Pumas but it happens to all the best goalkickers - normally about once a season!\n\nI see no cause for alarm. He will do what he always does on the training field and the results will come. I would be surprised if he had another poor kicking day at this World Cup.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: If I had to pick a World XV to play for my life tomorrow, I'd probably opt for Owen Farrell at fly-half.
