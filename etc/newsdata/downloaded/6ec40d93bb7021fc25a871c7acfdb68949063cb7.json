She called him a \u201cthreat\u201d to the nation, dubbed him an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d and concluded that he was a \u201ccorrupt human tornado.\u201d\n\nThe barrage was the latest salvo in an ongoing feud \u2014 alternatingly confrontational and oblique, cheeky and serious \u2014 that has smoldered since Election Day 2016, when one of them won the popular vote while the other won the electoral college and, with it, the presidency.\n\nIn addition to her pointed jibes on CBS, Clinton \u2014 a former first lady, senator from New York, secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 has assailed Trump on Twitter, in speeches and even in People magazine. She has mocked him \u2014 reading a snippet of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report in the president\u2019s muggy Queens baritone \u2014 and chided him, calling for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe president, for his part, has seemed similarly fixated. Since taking office, he has called her \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d on Twitter 127 times, led his frenzied rally crowds in chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d and is presiding over a reinvigorated investigation into more than 100 current and former State Department officials who sent messages to Clinton\u2019s private email address when she was secretary of state.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks during an event at the Sharon L. Morse Performing Arts Center on Thursday in The Villages, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nNearly three years after Election Day, they just can\u2019t seem to quit each other. Like Looney Tunes\u2019s Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, the duo appear trapped in a disjointed call-and-response \u2014 circling, talking past and attacking each other as if the 2016 contest never quite ended.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason they\u2019re locked into this dynamic is because like any good media narrative, it requires a foe and a hero, or a foil,\u201d said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog group. \u201cIt\u2019s just Narrative 101.\u201d\n\nThrough a spokesman, Clinton declined a request for an interview, and the White House did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nCurrent and former aides to both accuse the other of strikingly similar pathologies \u2014 being a sore loser (or, in his case, winner); harboring an unhealthy fixation on their former rival; and re-litigating the battles of the past rather than gracefully forging ahead into the future.\n\nTo hear the Clinton folks tell it, her attacks are largely substantive and focused on news and policy, while his are frivolous and based on personality. They say Trump simply can\u2019t get over losing the popular vote to Clinton and is haunted by this reality, which he fears undermines the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\n\u201cWe have a president who is irrationally and sometimes inexplicably focused on his opponent from three years ago, when he\u2019s a lot closer to having another opponent in 10 months\u2019 time,\u201d said Nick Merrill, a senior adviser to Clinton who was her traveling spokesman in 2016. \u201cHe\u2019s a small person, number one, and he clearly is smarting because at the end of the day, he knows he won the electoral college but more people who went to the polls on Nov. 8 wanted her to be president.\u201d\n\nThey add that Clinton is not so much picking a fight as defending herself, and weighing in on critical issues of national importance.\n\n\u201cShe engages him like a plumber engages a clogged toilet: only when necessary,\u201d Philippe Reines, a longtime Clinton adviser, quipped in a text message.\n\nChristina Reynolds, a Clinton 2016 spokeswoman, said that the former Democratic nominee \u201cis commenting in a forward-looking way\u201d while Trump \u201cis commenting in a backward-looking way\u201d \u2014 a differentiation echoed by several Clinton allies.\n\n\u201cMost of what she\u2019s doing is taking a stand on things that are happening right now that go against her values, that are worthy of standing up for, and I think she is a vital voice as part of that,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\nIn a September speech at George Washington University, for example, Clinton accused Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) of \u201cabdicating their responsibility\u201d on election security.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn at the White House on Thursday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump supporters, meanwhile, fault Clinton, saying that she simply can\u2019t move past her election loss and is not handling her defeat graciously. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, pointed to Trump\u2019s comments shortly after his victory as evidence that he tried to set a friendly tone.\n\nAt his inaugural luncheon at the Capitol, Trump said he was \u201chonored\u201d that Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, had attended and urged them to stand up to receive an ovation. \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people, so thank you both for being here,\u201d Trump said at the time.\n\nBut, by Conway\u2019s telling, Clinton did not reciprocate Trump\u2019s benevolent gesture. \u201cHillary engages with the president to stay relevant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbecoming of a former presidential candidate, U.S. senator and secretary of state, but it seems to be her only release.\u201d\n\nCliff Sims, a former White House aide, shared a video of Clinton\u2019s CBS interview on Twitter and asked, \u201cIs it not destructive to our democracy for the sore loser of a national election to say \u2014 with no justification whatsoever \u2014 that her opponent\u2019s victory was illegitimate?\u201d\n\nClinton allies, however, say that she is almost compelled to respond to the president\u2019s attacks on her. Yes, there are other failed presidential nominees who slinked more solidly into quiet obscurity \u2014 now-Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) in the immediate wake of the 2012 election, and Democrats John F. Kerry and Al Gore after their respective 2004 and 2000 losses. But these are unprecedented times, they say, and a norm-shattering leader such as Trump demands a countervailing force.\n\n\u201cSetting aside 2016, she was our secretary of state; she\u2019s been a presidential candidate,\u201d said Karen Finney, a spokeswoman for Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cFrankly in this moment in international politics, she has a really important and valuable perspective.\u201d\n\nClinton told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow in May that \u201cI\u2019m living rent free inside of Donald Trump\u2019s brain\u201d \u2014 a perch she seems to relish at times.\n\nAt a recent art exhibit in Venice, for example, Clinton sat at a replica of the Oval Office\u2019s Resolute Desk and, for about an hour, read through a stack of her deleted emails.\n\n\n\nFormer presidential candidate Hillary Clinton poses at an art exhibition where she read out her leaked emails in Venice on Sept. 10. (Gerda Studio/Reuters)\n\nFor Trump, continuing to lace into his former electoral foe serves several purposes. People close to him say there is a certain nostalgia in the attacks for a president who enjoys reliving his 2016 victory \u2014 the ultimate flouting of the political elites he so resents. More importantly, the broadsides also motivate base voters who view Clinton as the ultimate enemy.\n\nMedia Matters calculated that Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity mentioned Clinton in 86 percent of his show\u2019s episodes between Trump\u2019s inauguration and the end of August. Over the past year, the group found, Trump has mentioned Clinton at least 149 times in tweets, speeches, interviews and news conferences.\n\n\u201cThere is at least a political benefit for the president to bring up Clinton because to this day it fires up the conservative base,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a former White House aide. \u201cThe Clintons have been enemy number one to Republicans and conservatives for almost 30 years now, so just because she lost in 2016 does not erase three decades of hard feeling toward her and her husband from the right.\u201d\n\nBut at least in recent weeks, it has been Clinton \u2014 who is actively promoting her new book, which she wrote with her daughter \u2014 who is driving much of the conversation. In a range of television interviews, she has expressed her support for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThe inquiry, she told ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d was \u201cabsolutely unavoidable,\u201d and it would have been \u201ca dereliction of duty at that point for the Congress\u201d not to have moved forward with an investigation of the president\u2019s actions involving a controversial July 25 phone call he had with the president of Ukraine.\n\nShe has also been punchy, especially on Twitter. After Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, chastised the media on Tuesday for not investigating \u201cthe Clintons and crooked Clinton Foundation,\u201d Clinton offered a wry rejoinder: \u201cYes, I am famously under-scrutinized.\u201d And after Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) offered a Twitter defense of Clinton following news of the State Department\u2019s intensifying email probe of her former aides, Clinton replied, \u201cBut my emails. (Thank you.).\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope @HillaryClinton never, ever goes away & always uses platform she has to advance causes of women & children, AND share her views on politics,\u201d tweeted Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s 2016 communications director, adding \u201c#MoreHillary.\u201d Her tweet was in response to some anti-Clinton backlash from those who say Clinton should try to fade from public life.\n\nTrump also seems eager to keep Clinton around as a foil. On Thursday, during a speech at The Villages retirement community in Florida, a man shouted out \u201cLock her up!\u201d and the president invited him to stand up.\n\n\u201cI admonish you,\u201d Trump said sarcastically.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Clinton heckler shouted again, and the president returned to him.\n\n\u201cI sort of like him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can\u2019t admonish him again.\u201d", "description": "The Republican president and the Democrat he defeated keep circling each other like the 2016 contest never quite ended.", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-WcOV75Ywen9aIo7poNa4fGngjY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RVUEJIXGEQI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
