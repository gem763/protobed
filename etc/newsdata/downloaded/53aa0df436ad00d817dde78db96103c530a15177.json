If you\u2019d like to binge on sugary treats and deep-fried snacks, there\u2019s also a way to counter this. For decades now, a tradition of Tamilian households has been to use Diwali legiyam or Diwali marundhu (which literally translates into medicine), to nullify the ill-effects of gluttony. It can be prepared in advance, with a spoonful eaten each day, a week prior to and after the festivities. The traditional herbs used to get the digestive fires going, and allow your tummy to settle down. However, don\u2019t have an excess of legiyam itself \u2013 despite its herbal ingredients, it is strong! Also, it is not recommended for children below five years of age. Use only a spotlessly clean airtight container to store it.\n\n\n\nIngredients: (yields 1\u00bd cup approximately)\n\n2 \u00bd tbsp coriander seeds\n\n2 \u00bd tbsp ajwain\n\n2 tbsp cumin seeds\n\n2 tbsp black pepper\n\n\u00bc tsp dry ginger powder\n\n\u00be cup jaggery\n\n3-4 tbsp ghee\n\n1-2 tsp sesame oil\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod:\n\n\u00b7 Soak the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, ajwain and black pepper in warm water for three hours.\n\n\u00b7 Then grind this into a fine smooth paste.
