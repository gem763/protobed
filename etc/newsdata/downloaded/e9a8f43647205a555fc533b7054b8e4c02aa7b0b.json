MPs just did their job \u2013 they are not the delegates of their constituents but their representatives, and their role is to scrutinise proposed legislation to ensure the interests of the nation are being served.\n\nNow it is Johnson, not anyone else, who needs to \u201cman up\u201d and accept that his deal cannot work. Theresa May\u2019s deal was rejected three times, and his is even worse for the UK. It should not have surprised anyone.\n\nBullying others into supporting an early general election in the hope of filling parliament with new people more likely to support him will not make his deal any less bad.\n\nThere are only two possible actions now: unilaterally revoke Article 50, but that will likely do nothing to resolve the divisions created by this sorry saga; or have a Final Say vote. The choice should be straight between Remain and Johnson\u2019s bad deal as the only two options on the table. Brexit is too big a topic to be resolved by a general election.\n\nAfter three and a half years of failure, it should now be obvious that the \u201cwill of the people\u201d of 2016 cannot be delivered within the constraints that have been set. It is not parliament which has frustrated that will, but the dogmatic approach of the government in imposing its limitations to future status (the infamous \u201cred lines\u201d) based on its own failure to understand what the EU is and has achieved, and what it has delivered for the UK, its people and its economy.\n\nCharles Wood\n\nBirmingham\n\nReimagining the political game\n\nThese days it is not often that MPs are to be congratulated, but they do deserve praise for a new game they have invented, which should sell well with the coming of Christmas. The game is called You\u2019re Stumped! and the object of the game is to block any move the opposing team wishes to make.\n\nIn the event that a move is successful, the opposing team must try to find a way around the blockage. The rules are simple: there are none. Unlike chess, there is no time limit between moves and it is possible for a game to take a very long time to come to a successful conclusion. Any number of teams may play and it is allowed that players may move from team to team as the game proceeds.\n\nThere is a referee who has the responsibility of making sure nobody cheats, but it has been known for a referee to favour any friends involved in the match. Cheating is quite naturally frowned upon but has been known to take place. If cheating is discovered, then a vote is held to establish whether it was cheating or a variation of some unwritten rule dating back to the Middle Ages.\n\nNo betting is allowed, but a great deal of bargaining between the teams is an essential part of the game.\n\nThe possibility of a game lasting longer than three years is not impossible.\n\nColin Bower\n\nNottingham\n\nRegarding Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018fantastic\u2019 deal\n\nBoris Johnson studied classics and should be well aware of the true meaning of \u201cfantastic\u201d when he uses it to refer to his deal.\n\nHow about: fanciful, inconceivable, impossible, or imaginary as more honest translations?\n\nRosemary Ratcliffe\n\nStratford on Avon\n\nWhy should Remainers like Tony Blair be held to different standards than Brexiteers?\n\nHow curious that Tony Blair is branded \u201cinterfering\u201d for telling Jeremy Corbyn to resist giving way to an election, yet President Macron\u2019s veto on a three-month extension invites no comment whatsoever?\n\nIs it merely coincidence that the French president shared time with Boris Johnson fairly recently, and that Macron chose to break the EU \u201cnorm\u201d of staying out of domestic politics?\n\nThere has been, predictably perhaps, a lot of \u201cblame-gaming\u201d going on, but if David Cameron can comment without drawing criticism, why is Tony Blair\u2019s contribution so different?\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of either agent, as it happens, but I think Tony Blair has more right to get directly involved than Macron.\n\nFor me, this typifies the frequent bias aimed at any or all Remain voices that seek to protect the best interests of the people by ensuring proper scrutiny of the proposal, and by seeking to remove the threat of no deal, with legitimate parliamentary processes \u2013 unlike Johnson who, in my opinion, has bent no end of rulings in support of this mammoth folly.\n\nThis coincides with a leaked document suggesting that, as I feared and warned, our workers\u2019 rights are likely to fall victim to this right-wing coup, if we allow it.\n\nPeople died over hundreds of years fighting to secure those rights.\n\nAre we really prepared to throw them away in the pursuit of a right-wing fairytale that threatens also to hang, draw and quarter the United Kingdom as we know it?\n\nWe really are slipping back into the Dark Ages, aren\u2019t we?\n\nMichael Cunliffe\n\nWest Yorkshire\n\nWe must change our attitudes towards so-called vermin like grey squirrels\n\nThree cheers for Tracy Battensby (Letters, 27 October) for her defence of so-called invasive species. I have no patience with people who claim to have conservation credentials but are ruthless in their persecution of such animals as grey squirrels.\n\nTracy correctly points out that red squirrels were until relatively recently slaughtered in vast numbers by gamekeepers and other enemies of all wildlife except those they can shoot or hunt to death.\n\nMost of these kinds of attitudes can be traced back to the bloodsports fraternity, who have two classifications for animals \u2013 vermin or game. They bolster their attacks on those they consider \u201cvermin\u201d with propaganda which is grossly exaggerated, if not simply false.\n\nIt is not the fault of the animals that they were introduced into this country, almost always by owners of stately homes who thought they would decorate their estates. A more intelligent and compassionate approach to conserving native species and a more tolerant approach to \u201cinvasive\u201d animals who are in fact doing no harm would make a refreshing change.\n\nPenny Little\n\nOxfordshire", "description": "The outcome of the general election now being fought over in parliament will doubtless be determined largely by voters\u2019 allegiances on Brexit \u2013 akin to a referendum in all but name, but with one important difference.\u00a0 With a first-past-the-post system, all those votes cast for parties that fail to win a seat in a constituency will not coalesce to carry the weight they would if", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/26/15/Boris-Johnson-Downing-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
