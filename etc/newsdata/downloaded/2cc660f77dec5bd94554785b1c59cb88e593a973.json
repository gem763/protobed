Analysts at Citi had flagged expectations of further policy easing last month as credit data deteriorated, including cuts in the reserve ratio. The move came after Asian stock markets had already closed.\n\nThe Russian central bank also cut its benchmark rate on Friday, joining a wider drive for looser monetary policy around the world since the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in a decade at its last meeting. The ruble was up 0.5% against the dollar.\n\nAmong the biggest gainers in Europe were shares of G4S, the U.K.-based security giant, which rose 6.2%. Reports earlier Friday suggested its cash solutions business could be taken over by a U.S. firm.\n\nTelenor's shares dropped 3.3% after the Norwegian telecoms giant said it had ended talks to merge its Asian business with Axiata Group Berhad. Axiata shares gained 2.3%.\n\nInvestors will watch closely as the U.S. Labor Department releases the August jobs report later in the session. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast the U.S. economy added 149,000 jobs during the month and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays have flagged concerns that expectations of further interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve could be tempered by suggestions that the labor market is stronger than expected, sending the dollar higher.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will make a speech in Zurich later Friday, which could provide further signals about future monetary policy.\n\nDavid Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton, said economic growth in the U.S. and China was ticking along, though markets remain jittery and focused on hopes for supportive policy from central banks.\n\nThe \"doom and gloom\" about the global economy is overdone, Mr. Zahn said. \"This is all going to pass.\"\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasurys rose to 1.589% from 1.569% Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nThe price of oil remained steady even as Iran said it would abandon constraints on nuclear research set out in the 2015 nuclear deal, ratcheting up tensions with the U.S., which have led to conflict in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nBrent crude was down 2.21% at $59.60 a barrel. Analysts have flagged concerns the price of oil could drop if the global economy slows, despite rising tensions between Iran and the U.S.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 06, 2019 07:57 ET (11:57 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
