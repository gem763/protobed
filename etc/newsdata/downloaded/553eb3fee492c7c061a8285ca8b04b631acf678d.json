Throughout weeks of trial proceedings, prosecutors insisted the murder followed a petty dispute over Gilbert's allowance.\n\nRead more: A can of Coke reportedly swayed jury in case of Princeton grad found guilty of murdering father after his allowance was cut\n\nA former girlfriend told the court before Gilbert was convicted that she recalled the heir becoming \"scared\" and \"upset\" when he discovered his father would reduce his allowance to just $300 per week.\n\n\"He was concerned about getting cut off financially,\" Ressner said, the New York Times reported in June.\n\nHowever, Gilbert's mother repeatedly insisted that her son was at an unprecedented low in mental illness when he shot his father, and asked the judge ahead of the sentencing for a lenient timeline.\n\nCNN reported that Shelley Gilbert said that she wanted her son \"to be given as light a sentence as possible.\"\n\n\"As I've said many times in court, we've been trying to get Tommy into a hospital for 15 years,\" she reportedly said. \"He's too sick to be able to judge. He needs to be in a hospital, had he been so my husband would still be alive.\"\n\nHowever, the Times reported that Justice Melissa Jackson rejected the characterization, telling Gilbert that he \"knew exactly what you were doing.\"\n\n\"You were not insane at the time you killed your father,\" she said, according to the Times. \"You were not insane then. You are not insane now.\"\n\nThroughout the trial, Gilbert's lawyers painted the picture of a troubled person who had been diagnosed with severe compulsive disorder, depressive disorder, paranoid disorder, and psychosis.\n\nHis lifelong place among New York high society also came into play during the proceedings, as emails and internet records depict his mental health and financial status crumbling amid a paid-for Manhattan apartment and memberships at exclusive health and social clubs.", "description": "Shelley Gilbert asked the judge for \"as light a sentence as possible\" so her son could receive treatment for a variety of his mental health struggles.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8f786ef4fc2431ba3b0079?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
