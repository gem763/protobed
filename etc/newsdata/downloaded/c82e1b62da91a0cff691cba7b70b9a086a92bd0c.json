So \u201cDark Fate\u201d forgets the last three franchise movies (if only we all could do the same) and acts as a direct sequel to 1991\u2019s stellar \u201cTerminator 2: Judgement Day,\u201d when Sarah Connor (Hamilton) stopped the murderous artificial intelligence Skynet from existing and saved mankind\u2019s future.\n\n'Dark Fate': 'Terminator' star Linda Hamilton on why she ditched Hollywood \u2013 and what lured her back\n\nSarah Connor (Linda Hamilton, left) shows her protective side with Dani (Natalia Reyes) in \"Terminator: Dark Fate.\" (Photo: KERRY BROWN)\n\nSarah unfortunately finds out in \"Dark Fate\" that the robopocalypse is awfully hard to avoid, earning a fleeting victory only to be followed by a profound personal loss. Another A.I. called Legion rises up with a mechanized army to wipe out civilization, a revolutionary Rev-9 Terminator (Gabriel Luna) is sent back in time to kill a young Mexican woman Dani (Natalia Reyes), the enhanced super-soldier Grace (Mackenzie Davis) arrives from the year 2042 to protect her, and cavalry comes in the form of Sarah wielding a bazooka. It\u2019s different pieces playing the same game of chess \u2013 our heroes save us from mechanical overlords, someone will be back, rinse, repeat.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is equally adept with guns and draperies as the returning T-800 in \"Terminator: Dark Fate.\" (Photo: KERRY BROWN)\n\nIt takes a while before Schwarzenegger\u2019s T-800 shows up, but his reintroduction is welcome. Now going by \u201cCarl,\u201d the reformed cyborg assassin has become more human over the years and sells draperies for a living instead of hunting people, though his deadpan delivery of zingers hasn\u2019t changed. Grace and Sarah enlist his help against the Rev-9 as they try to get Dani out of harm\u2019s way, though Sarah still holds a grudge against her old frenemy.\n\n'Terminator' turns 35: Arnold Schwarzenegger's sunglasses completed the perfect killer\n\nProducer James Cameron returns to the property he began with 1984\u2019s classic \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d but the much more important comeback is Hamilton. Not quite the victim of the first film or the muscled butt-kicker of the second, Sarah of \"Dark Fate\" is grizzled and weighed down by what\u2019s happened in her crazy life, yet maintains her persona as heavily armed protective mama bear.\n\nMackenzie Davis plays enhanced super-soldier Grace in \"Terminator: Dark Fate.\" (Photo: KERRY BROWN)\n\nWalking an intriguing line between normal human and otherworldly Terminator, Davis\u2019s sinewy Grace is by far the most interesting character in the movie. While some of her significant backstory is revealed, she begs for extra time spent with her and the pummeled, fascinating wasteland of 2042. Also, both Grace and Sarah's complexities become lost amid the movie's whiz-bang nature. (Perhaps that's a consequence of a screenplay written by three people and five getting a \u201cstory by\u201d credit.)\n\n\u201cTerminator\u201d films always offer evolved robo-baddies and Luna\u2019s Rev-9 is seemingly a step up from Robert Patrick\u2019s \u201cT2\u201d liquid-danger T-1000. Miller boosts the cool factor having Rev-9 be able to separate his gooey, shapeshifting exoskeleton from his metal endoskeleton.\n\nGabriel Luna is the new Rev 9 Terminator, which can separate its shapeshifting form from its metal exoskeleton. (Photo: INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MAGIC)\n\n\"Dark Fate\" checks all the franchise boxes, including killer robots, Arnie and plenty of action set pieces, from a highway dump-truck chase to airborne jetliners crashing into each other. Strip away all that and there's just not much left.\n\nHamilton gets the ubiquitous \"I'll be back\" line this time, though one hopes if she does return again, \"Terminator\" will finally have figured out how to be remarkable once more.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/30/terminator-dark-fate-review-linda-hamilton-arnold-schwarzenegger/4095598002/", "description": "'Terminator' favorites Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton are back on screen together, but 'Dark Fate' can't turn around the flagging franchise.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
