We do it for us, to represent our people, to represent New Zealand.\n\n'The All Blacks have been doing it for 110 years. I was looking at the guy straight opposite me and that was Owen Farrell.

'He thought he was supposed to go all the way around it and go to their 10.\n\n'But because of that, he's the one who has to pay the fine. He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it.'", "description": "England will discover on Monday whether they'll face a fine for their V-shaped response to New Zealand's haka ahead of Saturday's Rugby World Cup semi-final.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/07/20216628-0-image-a-54_1572248509463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
