of the during the women's singles final \u2013 her first grand slam title AFP/Getty Images\n\nDropping only two sets in the entire tournament, the tenacious, power-hitting Andreescu barrelled through the competition at Flushing Meadows, showing no sign of a slowdown from a blockbuster summer that included wins at Toronto and Indian Wells.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost a match since March, so my confidence is sky-rocketing right now,\u201d Andreescu told reporters. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to take anything for granted because there\u2019s going to be weeks where you\u2019re going to lose. So right now I\u2019m just on cloud nine.\u201d\n\nEnding 2018 with a year-end ranking of 178, she had rocketed to 15th when she arrived at the year\u2019s final major, a meteoric rise that stunned even her coach.\n\n\u201cWhen I play my game I think nobody really likes that because I play a lot different than other players on tour,\u201d Andreescu said. \u201cI like to change up the rhythm and I\u2019ve always been like that and I just kept improving it.\u201d\n\nAndreescu, who said she is a voracious reader of Tony Robbins and other self-help authors, acknowledged that much of her improvement had come from developing mental discipline.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was ever as composed as I am now, or even a year ago,\u201d said Andreescu. \u201cI would get really down on myself and I would get very negative thoughts going through my mind. I would smash racquets. I\u2019d just yell at myself during matches.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu relaxed her mind with hip-hop before going\u00a0out on court to beat 23-time grand slam champion\u00a0Serena Williams in the US Open final.
