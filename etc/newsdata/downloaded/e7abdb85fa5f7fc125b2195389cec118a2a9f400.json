Plans are underway for the \u201cMarch for Trump: Stop Impeachment Now!\u201d rallies \u2014 set for Oct. 17 at the Capitol, and at locations around the nation.\n\n\u201cWe want our president to know he is not alone and we stand with him. Our president needs us more than ever before. We must not let him down,\u201d say organizers from Women for America First, a nonprofit group that is the main force behind the march, information found here.\n\nThe plans are percolating. So far, buses for rally participants have already been booked to depart from New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Iowa, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Ohio and Connecticut.\n\n\u201cWe are coming to Washington to support our president \u2014 to stand with him through this impeachment charade,\u201d Amy Kremer, a longtime tea party activist and founder of the host organization \u2014 tells SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are trying to subvert the will of the people and overturn the vote \u2014 and people are as mad as hell about it. It absolutely is a partisan witch hunt and the American people can see right through it,\u201d Ms. Kremer said, noting that Trump fans are taking the impeachment accusations personally.\n\n\u201cPeople see it not just as an attack on the president but an attack on us,\u201d Ms. Kremer said, adding that the tea party determination that once rallied the Republican-heartland base with similar rallies almost a decade ago is still alive and well.\n\n\u201cThe tea party did it in 2010 and we have to do it again in 2020. We need Congress to get back to doing the business of the people,\u201d Ms. Kremer said.\n\nSOME UNEXPECTED TRUMP NUMBERS\n\nAs impeachment media coverage continues at a shrill pace, a surprise headline has surfaced: \u201cTrump approval climbs to highest level of 2019 amid impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nYes, a new poll reveals all. Despite the political drama unfolding in several sectors, President Trump\u2019s approval has hit 49% in a new Hill/HarrisX poll \u2014 the highest ratings the president has received so far this year, according to the pollster. The finding is up two percentage points, and it is approaching the president\u2019s highest mark with Hill/HarrisX poll \u2014 which was 51% in August 2018.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s disapproval rating, meanwhile, dropped to 51%, which marks his lowest level so far this year,\u201d the pollster said.\n\nWHY THEY STILL LOVE TRUMP\n\nThe aforementioned poll is among several which reveal either hidden support for President Trump or strong disapproval of impeaching him \u2014 or even an \u201cinquiry\u201d into the matter. The reason for this trend is not rocket science.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s why Trump\u2019s poll numbers are defying the impeachment mess. A very large number of Americans don\u2019t have high levels of trust and respect for the government, and they\u2019re generally OK with Trump being the junkyard dog who digs it all out,\u201d writes CNBC political and economic analyst Jake Novak.\n\n\u201cTrump was elected to be the ultimate disruptor and to play that disruptive role as much as possible. \u2018Drain the swamp\u2019 wasn\u2019t just a campaign slogan, but a visceral feeling against establishment Washington in every way. Millions of Americans who voted for Trump and still support him chose him precisely because he is nasty, breaks the rules, and shows little respect for the political establishment at every level,\u201d Mr. Novak continues.\n\n\u201cThis is Donald Trump\u2019s brand. Comedian Dennis Miller put it as succinctly as possible with a Facebook post where he simply wrote: \u2018The simple fact is that if Trump was vaguely presidential he wouldn\u2019t be President\u2019.\u201d\n\nARE WE TALKING \u2018PANDORA\u2019 HERE?\n\n\u201cDemocrats opened the impeachment box, and they can\u2019t close it,\u201d writes Willis L. Krumholz, a contributor to The Federalist\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 case for impeachment is hopeless, but their motivation is simple. They whipped up their base into such a delusional frenzy during the \u2018Russia investigation,\u2019 they have to keep the narrative going at all costs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi faces a rebellion from her caucus if she doesn\u2019t go along with it. Clearly, this is going to blow up in Democrats\u2019 faces. In fact, the best thing that can happen for [President] Trump is for Democrats in the House to vote to impeach,\u201d Mr. Krumholz says.\n\n\u201cThen Trump can talk about Democrats obsessing over impeachment, instead of a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada (which would help farmers and factory workers), bipartisan drug pricing reform, or infrastructure. The White House is and should be very confident, then. Trump\u2019s approval rating is already up since this impeachment frenzy began. Democrats and the media probably just handed Trump a second term.\u201d\n\n\u2018COMEY\u2019 THE MINISERIES\n\nOf course Hollywood is interested in the saga of James B. Comey, and a major production centered on him is scheduled to begin in a matter of weeks.\n\n\u201cCBS Television Studios is assembling a powerhouse cast for a miniseries based on former FBI director James Comey\u2019s memoir \u2018A Higher Loyalty.\u2019 Jeff Daniels has signed on to play Comey in the production, and Brendan Gleeson will also star as Donald Trump,\u201d advises the Hollywood Reporter, an industry publication.\n\nIn addition, Michael Kelly \u2014 a veteran of the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d \u2014 will play Andrew McCabe, who became acting FBI director after Mr. Comey was fired by Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cBilly Ray \u2014 who directed \u2018Shattered Glass\u2019 and \u2018Captain Phillips\u2019 \u2014 adapted the book and will direct the miniseries, which is scheduled to go into production in November. A premiere date hasn\u2019t been set; CBS executives also have yet to decide whether the project will air on Showtime, CBS All Access or potentially both,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter said.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 31% of Americans overall trust the Supreme Court \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d; 52% of Republicans, 25% of independents and 22% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 34% overall trust the high court \u201csome\u201d; 32% of Republicans, 32% of independents and 38% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 18% trust the court \u201cvery little\u201d; 9% of Republicans, 19% of independents and 24% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 9% don\u2019t trust the court \u201cat all\u201d; 4% of Republicans, 11% of independents and 9% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 8% don\u2019t know; 3% of Republicans, 13% of independents and 6% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 22-24 and released Friday.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
