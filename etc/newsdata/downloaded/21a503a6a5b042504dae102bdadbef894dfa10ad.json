(Aletta Harrison/News24)\n\nIt was a harrowing week for South Africa.\n\nParts of the country experienced days of unrest and protests related to violence against women and children, and xenophobic attacks bedevilled parts of Gauteng. Ten people have been confirmed dead in running battles with the police.\n\nStories of the murder of students Uyinene Mrwetyana and Jesse Hess, and four young siblings in Durban made this week of one of the darkest for the country this year.\n\nThis week on POLOTIKI, News24 senior politics reporter Tshidi Madia is joined by News24 politics reporter Lizeka Tandwa to discuss the overall political reaction to the unrest.\n\nDid Cyril Ramaphosa exercise good leadership? Can we trust political leaders to guide the country through this dark time?\n\nAlso, in the political realm, the Zandile Gumede saga is coming to an end.\n\nThe former eThekwini mayor finally resigned.\n\nOn Thursday, a full sitting of the eThekwini city council elected former KwaZulu-Natal transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda to succeed Gumede as the executive mayor.\n\nThis follows a postponement last week when Gumede withdrew her resignation.\n\nWe want to hear your views on our leaders' response to the recent spate of violence in the country. Do you think they have a solid plan to create lasting solutions?", "description": "It has been a harrowing week for South Africa.
