He is credited with crafting Russia\u2019s infamous ban against so-called \u201cgay propaganda,\u201d and he has previously been reprimanded by the State Duma ethics committee for making bigoted comments.\n\nMattel had no immediate comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
