Do you see me now? Dad.\n\n\"You must have known I would come for you one day. That I would find you.\"\n\nWhen Cain insisted Nate was lying, the farmhand added: \"I'm your son.\"\n\nMeanwhile, back in the village, Faith Dingle went inside Nate's caravan and made a shocking discovery while searching through his draws.\n\nFaith collapsed onto the floor of the caravan in horror while looking at an old photo.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBack on the boat, Nate and Cain continued to clash in a fiery scuffle during a family reunion of sorts.\n\nWhen Moira threatened to intervene, her toyboy lover shouted at her to stay out of it as her \"use was over\".\n\nIn the commotion, Moira was knocked off the boat by the mast and went crashing into the lake.\n\nThey looked into the dark water but Moira did not resurface - prompting fears she may die.\n\nThe big reveal came after Cain's plan to get revenge on Nate for sleeping with his wife backfired spectacularly.\n\nCain managed to trick Nate and Moira into joining him on a fishing trip - and they could not hide their unease as he steered them to the centre of the lake.\n\nWhile Moira was inside making bacon sandwiches, Cain told Nate that a \"dirty, backstabbing, arrogant, scumbag with a death wish\" was having an affair with his wife.\n\nWith the tension rising, Nate confessed: \"Your missus is bored of your boring life and your boring marriage. That\u2019s why she\u2019s been going behind your back with me. The caravan, the barn, your bed.\"\n\nMoira heard a loud thud outside and discovered that Cain had knocked Nate out - but he eventually came round and dropped that explosive bombshell.\n\nEmmerdale viewers took to Twitter after the explosive episode.\n\nOne viewer tweeted: \"Bloody hell - @emmerdale was good tonight!! I am shooketh!!\"\n\n\"Okay but I actually avoided all the theories about Nate so I\u2019m truly shocked. This is a great twist,\" added another.\n\nA third asked: \"Er... can we be issued with a flow chart of who is related to who please?\"\n\n\"Why #Emmerdale why leave the episode like that. Bring on tomorrow,\" said a fourth.\n\nEmmerdale viewers are eagerly anticipating Wednesday night's episode to discover whether anyone will die.\n\nMoira does not resurface after getting trapped in some weeds under the water.\n\nThere are also problems above the surface when a huge explosion rips through the boat and threatens to kill everyone on board.\n\nWill any of the trio die in the devastating fireball?\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEmmerdale star Sally Dexter, who plays Faith Dingle, has promised a \"heavy storm\" is on the way for the Dingles in the coming weeks.\n\nTeasing the \"dire consequences\" that will occur as a result of the new twist, Sally confirmed emotional scenes were on the cards as she welled up while speaking to Mirror Online at the Inside Soap Awards 2019.\n\nNot only did Sally hint that not everyone would make it through, she confirmed three characters in particular would suffer as a result.\n\nSally said: \"Yes, there is a very shocking twist with Nate's identity and it has dire consequences for my son Cain, for Moira my daughter-in-law, and me.\"\n\n\"We have to come through a heavy storm and some of us might not make it.
