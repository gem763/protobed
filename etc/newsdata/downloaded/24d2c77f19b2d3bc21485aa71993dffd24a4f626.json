Investors often sell losing stocks at the end of the year to lower their tax bill from the capital increases.\n\n\"As we head into 4Q, tax loss selling becomes a possible source of technical pressure on some stocks,\" Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist said in a note on Monday.\n\nThe bank ran a screen to find the stocks most vulnerable to the tax selling pressure this time of the year. It found stocks that were well-liked by investors and analysts but have suffered at least 10% drop in prices from mid-January to the end of the third quarter.\n\n\"We used some simplifying assumptions to produce a list of stocks that may have a greater probability of underperforming into year end on this technical basis,\" Wilson said. \"Back testing shows this screening method has had some success in creating a group of stocks that may underperform in 4Q.\"\n\nStocks from this screen have underperformed the broad market by 2.2% on average in the fourth quarter over the past 17 years, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe bank's list of stocks for this year include E-Trade, Tapestry, Cigna, Marathon Oil, FedEx, DuPont, and Align Technology, which have tumbled as much as 30% in the first three quarters of 2019.", "description": "If you still own these stocks, watch out for more losses ahead.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106078523-1565787184284gettyimages-1161343278.jpeg?v=1565989130", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
