Mattarella is expected to announce a way out of the government crisis on Wednesday evening.\n\nMattarella is now tasked with deciding the way forward, including whether to call a snap election or instal a new government based on an alternative majority in parliament.\n\nOne of the sticking points in discussions about a potential PD-5Stars alliance had been Conte\u2019s political future. Initially, PD leader Nicola Zingaretti ruled out reappointing Conte, who is not affiliated with any party, saying Italy needs a clean break from the previous government. The 5Stars, who are currently the biggest party in the Italian parliament, had said they would not budge on his name.\n\nBut according to the two PD officials and one government aide from the 5Star Movement, Zingaretti and 5Star leader Luigi Di Maio agreed Monday that Conte should remain prime minister. They also said the two sides are currently considering either former Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, currently the PD\u2019s president, or MEP Roberto Gualtieri, a member of the PD, as candidates to be Italy's next European commissioner.\n\nAll three people also said Rome has asked European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen to give Italy more time to propose a candidate to join her team.\n\nAfter the official government collapse last week, Salvini had told Mattarella he is willing to make peace with the 5Stars and form a new government with them to prevent them from teaming up with the PD. But on Monday night, Salvini seemed to have given up on that idea and said during a press conference he is \"proud\" to have pulled the plug on the coalition government, accusing his former partners of scheming against him to rule with the PD for a long time.\n\nA PD-5Star coalition would make the League Italy\u2019s biggest opposition party, but polls predict the League would gain parliamentary seats in a new election.\n\nITALY NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "President Mattarella is expected to announce a way out of the government crisis on Wednesday evening.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1162876577-1200x628.jpg"}
