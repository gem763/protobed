Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nEven as contestants prepare for next week\u2019s 12-candidate Democratic debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, the November event is beginning to come together as well, as NBC News reports:\n\nMSNBC and The Washington Post will co-host the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate in Georgia next month, MSNBC announced Tuesday.\n\nThe debate will take place in prime time on Nov. 20, and will air live on MSNBC and Radio One. It will also stream on MSNBC.com and the Post\u2019s website, as well as across mobile devices via NBC News and the Post\u2019s mobile apps and Urban One\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nThe specific location, venue, format and moderators will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee toughened the polling and fundraising thresholds for this fifth debate, as I noted last month:\n\nThe thresholds for \u201cgrassroots fundraising\u201d didn\u2019t change that much: Candidates must now show they have at some point in the cycle raised money from 160,000 donors (as opposed to 130,000, previously) with at least 600 (previously 400) in 20 states\u2026.\n\nNor will the new polling requirements (3 percent in four specified national or early state polls, or 5 percent in two early state polls, beginning with polls taken last week and running until seven days before the November debate) represent a problem for the stronger candidates, who almost always poll above three percent (a group that currently includes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. But some next-tier hopefuls could experience some problems.\n\nAt this point, eight candidates have qualified for the November stage: the aforementioned five polling champs, plus Cory Booker, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang (who got his fourth qualifying poll just today). Others have until November 13 to make the cut. As Politico reports, it\u2019s looking a mite dicey for some, including four who will be on the stage in Ohio next week:\n\nCurrently, more than a dozen candidates are still short of the qualification thresholds, including four who will be on stage next week in Ohio: Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke. Those four have all said they\u2019ve cleared the 165,000 donor threshold required for the debate, but each needs at least three more 3-percent polls to qualify.\n\nIt would be a good time for the October debaters who are November non-qualifiers to make a splash.", "description": "The November Democratic candidate debate will be held in Georgia on November 20, sponsored by MSNBC and the Washington Post.
