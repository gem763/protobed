There are warning signs when you hear that.\n\n(Image: 2018 Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI know football careers are short and they have to make hay while the sun shines \u2013 I am not na\u00efve and I understand how it works.\n\n\u201cSometimes if you have made a few quid in football, you have got to look and think: This club is going to go under. What can I do?\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the game were saying about Bury: There is a reckoning coming there because they were handing out some massive contracts.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cI am all for a wage cap. I like the way they do things in America with the NFL. I think a lot of the clubs would get behind it. If a giant club came down, you could give them two years dispensation on the wage cap.\n\n\"But players have to take responsibility as well.\u201d\n\nFFP in League One limits player expenditure to 60% of turnover (50% in League Two). But it has not stopped Bury's expulsion from the EFL.\n\nBolton were saved just days away from liquidation while Macclesfield players have again gone unpaid.\n\nA League One club is believed to receive \u00a3881,000 in Sky TV money plus an annual \u00a3675,000 solidarity payment paid by the Premier League.\n\nBut the financial reality is that owners like MacAnthony need to inject their own money \u2013 and sell players like Jack Marriott \u2013 to keep even well-run clubs solvent.\n\n\u201cOver the years I have put in \u00a315m,\u201d said MacAnthony, the real estate millionaire who took over in 2006.\n\n\u201cI have got some back so right now the club probably owes me \u00a35-6m.\u201d\n\nDarren Ferguson's side, with Mo Eisa and Ivan Toney up front, are the top scorers in the division thanks before hosting Michael Appleton's Lincoln on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe turned down nearly \u00a35m for one of our strikers on deadline day,\u201d MacAnthony added. \u201cFor any reason we didn't get promotion this season, we know we have an asset base that we can refer to. But I would say even a small club in League Two is probably losing upwards of \u00a31m a year.\n\n\u201cIf nobody starts the conversation to push this along it is just going to carry on. We are going to get more clubs getting into trouble, more going out of business and more heartbroken fans.\n\n\"We need action right now so another Bury doesn't happy.\u201d\n\nA meeting of EFL clubs last month discussed ideas to help clubs and insiders insist there is an appetite for change.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Peterborough owner MacAnthony says players and the PFA must agree to limit salaries in the lower leagues", "authors": ["Neil Mcleman", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19019479.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-PHOTO-Bury-FC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
