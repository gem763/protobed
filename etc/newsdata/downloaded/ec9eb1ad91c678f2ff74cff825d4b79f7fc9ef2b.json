Oil prices edge higher on potential Brexit deal; OPEC signals of possible cuts\n\n* Britain, EU make headway on possible Brexit deal\n\n* OPEC, allies to seek market stability beyond 2020\n\n* Coming Up: API inventory data at 2030 GMT\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Jaganathan\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday,\n\ntracking gains in equities, as investors pinned hopes on a\n\npotential Brexit deal between Britain and the European Union and\n\non signals from OPEC and its allies that further supply curbs\n\ncould be possible.\n\nBut gains were limited on lingering concerns of a global\n\neconomic slowdown.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude oil futures had risen\n\n11 cents to $58.85 by 0103 GMT, up about 0.2% from the previous\n\nday's close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude had\n\ngained 10 cents or 0.2% to $52.91 a barrel.\n\n\"Oil is starting to see some bullish positions added on the\n\neasing of two big tail risks for global demand, the U.S.-China\n\ntrade war and Brexit,\" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst\n\nat OANDA in New York.\n\n\"While a broader trade deal seems unlikely in the immediate\n\nfuture, the risks for the U.S.-China trade war have been\n\nfading.\"\n\nLast-ditch talks between Britain and the European Union to\n\nget a Brexit deal ahead of a summit of the bloc's leaders this\n\nweek ran past midnight to Wednesday, but it was still unclear if\n\nLondon could avoid postponing its departure, due on Oct. 31.\n\nAnalysts have said any deal that avoids a \"hard\" or no-deal\n\nBrexit should boost economic growth and in turn oil growth and\n\nprices.\n\nProviding more support, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad\n\nBarkindo said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\n\nCountries and allied producers \"will do whatever (is) in its\n\npower\" to sustain oil market stability beyond 2020. OPEC, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by 1.2\n\nmillion barrels per day to support the market. Yet an expected\n\nrise in U.S. crude inventories this week kept prices under\n\npressure. EIA/S\n\nStill, concerns of a global economic slowdown due to a\n\nlingering trade war between the United States and China and\n\nswelling U.S. inventories pressured prices.\n\nU.S. crude stocks probably grew for the fifth straight week,\n\na preliminary Reuters poll showed.\n\nU.S. oil inventory reports are due out from industry group\n\nthe American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday and the U.S.\n\nEnergy Information Administration on Thursday. The reports have\n\nbeen delayed one day because of a U.S. government holiday.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Oil prices edge higher on potential Brexit deal; OPEC signals of possible cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC8S19N_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
