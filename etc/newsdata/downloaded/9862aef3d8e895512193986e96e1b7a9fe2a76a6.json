A week later, tips led them to another stash of paintings, including a Kandinsky and a Chagall. The day after that, they seized two dozen more paintings by famous artists.\n\nThe 2009 raids eventually netted more than 100 works owned by Calisto Tanzi, the former chairman and chief executive of Parmalat, the Italian dairy giant that collapsed in 2003 in the wake of a massive accounting fraud.\n\nOn Oct. 29, a decade after the paintings were seized, they will be auctioned in Milan, with the proceeds going to Parmalat\u2019s remaining creditors, including its owner, French dairy company Lactalis.\n\nOfficials of Parmalat and Lactalis declined to comment on the auction. Mr. Tanzi, now 80 years old, couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nIn March 2012, Calisto Tanzi, founder of Italian dairy giant Parmalat, appeared at a hearing in Bologna, Italy. Mr. Tanzi, who was suffering health problems, had a medical tube attached to his nose.

Over the years, many of his assets, including real estate and a professional soccer team, have been sold to raise funds to partially pay back the thousands of investors he swindled.\n\nMr. Tanzi had denied owning any valuable art, prosecutors said, but in the weeks before Parmalat\u2019s collapse, he hid paintings and other works in houses in and around Parma. The houses were owned by Mr. Tanzi, his friends and his daughter. Prosecutors said they swooped in just before Mr. Tanzi\u2019s associates tried to sell the entire collection to a Russian billionaire.\n\nMany art-world insiders knew that Mr. Tanzi had accumulated paintings by famous Impressionist and modern artists. But prosecutors didn\u2019t find them until an investigative television program reported that the Monet and several other paintings were about to be sold. The spotlight led the seller, whose phone had been tapped, to slip up. Investigators found those paintings and then tipsters helped them find the others.\n\nIn December 2009, an Italian tax police officer displayed \u2018Musicien Voyageur,\u2019 a 1971 painting by Marc Chagall that belonged to Calisto Tanzi and was seized in Parma. Photo: Marco Vasini/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nParmalat filed for bankruptcy after it emerged that a company bank account in the Cayman Islands said to hold \u20ac4 billion didn\u2019t exist. An audit later showed that the company had overstated sales and profits for more than a decade and had debt of \u20ac14.3 billion\u2014eight times more than declared. More than a dozen executives landed in prison. In 2008, Mr. Tanzi received a 10-year sentence for market manipulation. In another trial in 2010, he was sentenced to 18 years for criminal conspiracy and fraud. Both sentences were slightly reduced on appeal. Mr. Tanzi is under house arrest at his villa near Parma.\n\nPandolfini Casa d\u2019Aste, the auction house organizing the Milan event, valued the sale\u2019s 55 works, most of which are paintings, at between \u20ac6 million and \u20ac8 million, an overall estimate that some in the art industry called conservative. The trove includes \u201cFalaise du Petit Ailly \u00e0 Varengeville\u201d painted by Monet in 1896 and 1897. Pandolfini valued the painting at as much as \u20ac1.2 million, the same amount put on a Picasso still life from 1944 that will be on the block. Also up for auction are two van Goghs\u2014a small still life and a large landscape titled \u201cPollard Willow\u201d that is starting at \u20ac120,000, but is expected to go for at least three times that amount. \u201cSestri-Abends,\u201d painted by Kandinsky on the Italian Riviera in 1905, is estimated to fetch about \u20ac250,000.\n\nVassily Kandinsky\u2019s \u2018Sestri-Abends\u2019 which was painted in 1905, is among the works in the auction.

Three, including Italian futurist Giacomo Balla\u2019s \u201cWindow in Dusseldorf,\u201d don\u2019t have export licenses.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which works of art up for auction in Milan on Oct. 29 intrigue you most? Why do you believe the auction will be a success\u2014or not\u2014with collectors? Join the conversation below.\n\nWhile there are many top artists, the quality of the works is \u201cB level,\u201d said Thomas Seydoux, former chairman of impressionist and modern art at Christie\u2019s and now an art-industry consultant. But the auction house\u2019s decisions to hold the sale before more important ones in New York in November and to keep initial estimates low could help drum up interest, he said.\n\n\u201cSelling a Monet in Milan can sound risky, because that\u2019s not where the market is, but with the low estimates people are likely to show up and start bidding and at that point anything can happen,\u201d Mr. Seydoux said. \u201cA relatively unimportant Monet or a small Picasso still life suddenly looks a lot more attractive if you don\u2019t have more famous pieces on offer.\u201d Mr. Seydoux estimates the entire collection, which he hasn\u2019t seen in person, could fetch up to \u20ac12 million if there aren\u2019t any surprises on the condition of key paintings.\n\nAmong works that will go up for auction in Milan is Pablo Picasso\u2019s \u2018Nature Morte au Citron, \u00e0 l\u2019Orange et au Verre,\u2019 completed in 1944. Photo: Pandolfini Casa d'Aste\n\n\u201cThis is a good time to come to market with a collection like this, because the prices of impressionist and modern paintings have been pushed up by new interest coming from Asian clients looking for iconic names,\u201d said Pietro De Bernardi, chief executive of Pandolfini and one of the auction\u2019s two curators. Participants in the Oct. 29 auction can bid by phone or in person.\n\nMore than 50 other painting and prints by lesser-known artists seized from Mr. Tanzi are being sold in an online auction run by the court in Parma. Most works in the sale, which concludes Sept. 19, drew bids well above their low estimates. \u201cNun With Little Girl\u201d by Parma native Renato Vernizzi, who died in 1972, started at \u20ac300. With a day to go, bidding had climbed to \u20ac4,000.\n\nWrite to Eric Sylvers at eric.sylvers@wsj.com", "description": "Van Goghs, a Monet and other paintings collected by disgraced Parmalat founder Calisto Tanzi will be auctioned in Milan in October.", "authors": ["Eric Sylvers"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107991/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
