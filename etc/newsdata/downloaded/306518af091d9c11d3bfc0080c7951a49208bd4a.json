Even for those who don\u2019t make the cut, the prizes for the top 10 are really great.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered all the pleasantries, let\u2019s discuss what I haven\u2019t liked. After so many years of lights, camera and action I expected the contestants to be a lot better dressed, but all we\u2019ve been getting is \u2013 in the sarcastic words of the late Aretha Franklin \u2013 \u201cgreat gowns, beautiful gowns\u201d.\n\nThere have been some cute fashion moments here and there, but the styling has not been up to par overall.\n\nWith Truworths as a clothing sponsor, I guess there isn\u2019t much for the stylists to work with.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the weekly themes have brought a switch in the show, making an allowance for current affairs to inform the Idols\u2019 stage.\n\nBut I did feel that having a DJ Tira themed week was in bad taste, especially after sexual harassment allegations surfaced against him on Twitter during the #AmINext campaign.\n\nThis left a sour taste in my mouth because a central tenet of the show the previous week had been speaking out against gender-based violence, so it made no sense to feature someone who is now an alleged perpetrator.\n\nThe competition is a great opportunity for aspiring musicians to put their talent and brands out there, but many of the Idols winners have come and gone then been forgotten.\n\nThe show should perhaps consider having an Idols concert to reflect on the talent that has graced its stage and give viewers an opportunity to engage with their all-time favourites.", "description": "Idols SA has been around for 15 seasons and 17 years, drawing viewership from all over the country, but is it still worth the watch?
