This is not the Democratic party of John Kennedy, who I was in support of,\u201d Voight told the outlet. \u201cThey had many heroes in the Democratic party. They have no heroes today. There\u2019s a lot of slander and name-calling and lying that\u2019s going on and passing itself off as news. This is my opinion. That\u2019s where I stand and I don\u2019t like it. Somebody has to stand up and say that and punch back at that nonsense. This is not America. The Democratic Party doesn\u2019t represent America anymore.\u201d\n\nJON VOIGHT RESPONDS TO ALYSSA MILANO ATTACK: 'IGNORANCE DOESN'T SCARE ME'\n\nVoight previously defended Trump against impeachment, declaring Democratic lawmakers a \"disgrace.\" He echoed those sentiments at the \u201cMaleficent\u201d premiere.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is going to win the presidency once again and this is going to be proven to be nonsense just as the two years with [the Mueller Report] and millions of dollars wasted and has taken those people in the House who are Democrats away from doing the business of the people,\u201d he opined.\n\nJON VOIGHT DECLARES TRUMP IS 'GREATEST PRESIDENT OF THIS CENTURY' IN TWITTER VIDEO\n\nThe Oscar-winner also discussed actors Eric McCormack and Debra Messing recently calling upon The Hollywood Reporter to publish a list of Hollywood Trump donors for the purpose of blacklisting them in show business.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is going to win the presidency once again\" \u2014 Jon Voight\n\n\u201cThe left was so concerned about the Hollywood Ten during the \u201850s but they are not at all concerned with the blacklist today and people losing jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very outspoken about it and they attack anybody who is for Trump or who is for the Republican Party. The Democratic Party has been undermined and overtaken, and I wish it could recoup itself and that there could be people who would stand up for the Democratic Party that we have known and we have counted on and there are not anybody in that group who is standing up and protecting it. They are falling in.\u201d\n\nVoight previously praised Trump back in May, calling him \"the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe star is best known for his lead role as Joe Buck in the 1969 film \"Midnight Cowboy.\" His decades-long career includes movie roles in \"Deliverance,\" \"Mission: Impossible,\" \"Anaconda,\" \"Zoolander\" and \"Transformers,\" as well as television roles in \"24\" and \"Ray Donovan.\"", "description": "Actor Jon Voight declared in a recent interview that Democrats no longer represent America and that Donald Trump will win the election in 2020.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy", "Jon Voight"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/JonVoight1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
