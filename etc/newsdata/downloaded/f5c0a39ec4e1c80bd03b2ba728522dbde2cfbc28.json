A lot of people didn\u2019t even think they would come here to play. If I score then I will get a tattoo on my skin,\u201d he said in a video posted on the club\u2019s Youtube channel.\n\nThe 21-year-old did not take long to fulfil his promise, giving the Belgian side a shock lead in the ninth minute by beating Real keeper Thibaut Courtois with an unorthodox finish.\n\nHe struck again later in the first half to make his side believe in an unlikely victory at the home of the 13-times European champions, although Real salvaged a draw with second-half headed goals from Sergio Ramos and Casemiro.\n\nBonaventure is unlikely to forget the occasion, however, especially after being reminded of his pledge to mark the goals with ink.\n\n\u201cI guess I will now have to get two tattoos,\u201d he said jokingly to Belgian television channel RTL after the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to have scored two goals, but we really wanted to win the game and we were not far away from doing it. We have to be content with the point, which is not a bad result.\u201d\n\nBruges coach Philippe Clement did not make any pledges like Bonaventure\u2019s but underlined his side\u2019s feat in coming so close to toppling the most successful team in European football.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic point, the way we played is historic and for me this night would be historic whether we got three points or one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe came here with an ambitious plan, not just to defend, and we delivered it almost perfectly.\u201d", "description": "Club Bruges forward Emmanuel Bonaventure was ecstatic after scoring twice in his side's surprise 2-2 draw at Real Madrid in the Champions League but now faces a painful double session in a tattoo parlour after coming good on a pre-match pledge.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436051947&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903OL", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
