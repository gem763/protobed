Bush over the Iraq War in the final two years of his presidency. More recently, she rebuffed demands from her party\u2019s liberal wing to impanel a full-scale impeachment effort following Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report about Trump and Russian interference in 2016. But now that she\u2019s begun an impeachment inquiry, she betrays no doubt about seeing it through. Impeachment promises to be an ordeal, especially against a president so volatile, combative, and willing to twist the truth. Approaching that heaving sea, Pelosi projected resolve. \u201cWhen we decide if we are going to go forward, we will be ready, and we will be ironclad,\u201d she said, referring to potential votes on articles of impeachment. It sounded less like a boast than a statement of fact.\n\nWithout detailing specific plans, Pelosi left the clear impression that the impeachment process will conclude sooner rather than later, and its focus will be more narrow than broad. She refused to answer when asked directly whether any eventual articles of impeachment will cover issues beyond Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine and the administration\u2019s defiance of subpoenas from the committees investigating them. Some House Democrats have advocated for articles that address everything from family separations to emoluments. \u201cNo one should infer from what we\u2019re doing that there is an imprimatur to do emoluments if it\u2019s not\u201d listed among Democrats\u2019 justifications for impeaching Trump, Pelosi said. (She was careful to say, too, that if Trump\u2019s team has \u201cexculpatory testimony they want to present\u201d on Ukraine, House Democrats are open to it: \u201cWe pray that that will be the case\u2014something we don\u2019t understand about how he interprets the Constitution.\u201d)\n\nThough Pelosi is vague on just how much longer the inquiry will go on, she expressed concern about Americans\u2019 appetite for a lengthy process. \u201cHow much drama can the American people handle?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere does the law of diminishing returns set in? Where is the value added not worth the time?\u201d\n\nAs those comments demonstrate, Pelosi seems focused on trying to win over public opinion on the impeachment process\u2014and the Democrats\u2019 broader governing agenda. Even as she dismissed the complaints from House Republicans about the investigation, she repeatedly returned to the theme of finding ways to reach voters now skeptical of Democrats. In the internal Democratic debate over whether the party\u2019s future depends more on mobilizing its own core supporters or recapturing swing voters who took a flier on Trump in 2016, she clearly leans more toward the latter. This preference seems to inform not only how she\u2019s approaching the House inquiry, but also how she\u2019s assessing the party\u2019s policies.", "description": "The House speaker is concerned about voters\u2019 appetite for a lengthy process: \u201cHow much drama can the American people handle?\u201d", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19290549816602/facebook.jpg?1572458768", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
