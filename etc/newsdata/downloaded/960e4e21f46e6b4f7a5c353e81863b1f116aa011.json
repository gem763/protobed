(Photo: Jo Giannetti)\n\n\"The Beautiful Ones\" is for everyone.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you're a Prince fanatic or if your interest is simply piqued by all things music or pop culture: The book is worth picking up.\n\nPrince Nelson Rogers' first \u2013 and only \u2013 written book hits shelves Tuesday.\n\n\"The Beautiful Ones\" (Spiegel & Grau, 288 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 out of four stars) is not a read, but an experience, an immersion inside the mind of a musical genius. You are steeped in Prince's images, his words, his essence.\n\nWhen considering how he wanted to write the book, Prince told his collaborator and editor, Dan Piepenbring, that it would include \"bombshells.\"\n\nBut Piepenbring tells USA TODAY in an interview that because Prince died before they really had the chance to dive into the project, the bombshells he had in mind never came to light.\n\n\"The Beautiful Ones\" by Prince (Photo: Penguin Random House)\n\n\"Unfortunately, because he died so soon into it, there's nothing really salacious or scandalous,\" Piepenbring says. \"I think the bombshells end up being kind of just the opposite.\"\n\nThe book is quotidian Prince: Readers see the artist in his day to day more than the larger-than-life figure shrouded in mystery. But understanding the boy who grew up in Minneapolis doesn't take away from the musician's mystique.\n\n\"I kind of like that the book kind of has this lack of resolution, and that really it's kind of made up of fragments,\" Piepenbring says. \"I think even had he lived, the mystery would still be intact, because he really was writing the book in part to understand himself better.\"\n\n'I Feel For You': Listen to Prince's previously unheard acoustic demo\n\nPrince estate announces: Rare Prince music videos will now be released weekly\n\nFramed by an introduction written by Piepenbring, the book offers a sort of coming-of-age story. It's told through memories: drafted manuscript pages scratched on a legal pad, photos, handwritten lyrics, doodles, cartoons, quotes from newspaper articles. The list goes on, the selections coming from more than 5,000 distinct items found at Paisley Park after Prince's death, Piepenberg explains.\n\nPrince taking a phone call in bed, circa 1980-81. (Photo: Allen Beaulieu)\n\nThe materials are sorted into sections giving readers an intimate look at Prince in different stages of life, including his childhood and the period during which he worked on his first record as a teenager.\n\nAnd while it offers insight, the book may leave you feeling muddled \u2013 but that's not a negative. The way the book is structured simply makes one want to read it again, to leaf through the pages and be immersed in Prince's world.\n\n\"There is definitely a way he could be in conversation, digressive or discursive,\" Piepenbring explains. \"He'd always bounce around from subject to subject, and then his mind was always working so feverishly.\"\n\nThe wild, frenzied mode he operated under while brainstorming with Piepenbring is almost tangible within the pages of \"The Beautiful Ones.\"\n\nThe more you learn about Prince, the more you wonder.\n\n\"He flouts your expectations at every juncture,\" Piepenbring says.\n\nThe book can be a starting point for a Prince fascination, or a continuation of long-standing admiration. Either way, it will deepen the connection of any reader with the musical icon.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/27/usa-today-reviews-princes-the-beautiful-ones-plus-exclusive-pic/4067894002/", "description": "\"The Beautiful Ones\" is for all of us.
