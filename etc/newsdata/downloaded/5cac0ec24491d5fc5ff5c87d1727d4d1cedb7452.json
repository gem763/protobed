Jerry Nadler, told Lewandowski his \u201cbehavior in this hearing room has been completely unacceptable,\u201d and said holding him \"in contempt\" is \"certainly under consideration.\"\n\nNBC News correspondent Ken Dilanian suggested to MSNBC's Ali Velshi that Democratic lawmakers were primarily focused on \"getting their moment on television\" than getting the facts from their witness.\n\nCOMBATIVE LEWANDOWSKI FRUSTRATES DEMOCRATS, AS IMPEACHMENT-PROBE HEARING DESCENDS INTO CHAOS\n\n\u201cI think it has largely been a failure in part because Democrats have been more interested in getting their moment on television of yelling at Corey Lewandowski and making the point and winning the argument rather than patiently questioning him,\" Dilanian said.\n\nPolitico reporter and MSNBC analyst Jake Sherman questioned why Lewandowski's involvement in the Mueller report \"wasn't the focus\" of the hearing.\n\n\"At the end of the day, Democrats are going to have to leave this hearing and say, 'What did we accomplish today and did it bring us closer to X?' They don't know what 'X' is,\" Sherman told the panel.\n\n\"They don't know what they're doing and at the end of this hearing, I suspect... that they feel like Trump has changed the rules so much that he's impervious to all of this. He's not afraid of impeachment... so they're just kind of coasting along and doing their thing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, CNN commentator Amanda Carpenter similarly pulled no punches.\n\n\"We're all thinking what was the point of this hearing today,\" Carpenter said. \"Republicans, Trump people keep talking about 'owning the libs.' Corey Lewandowski owned the Judiciary Committee today. Jerry Nadler played a stupid game and they won a stupid prize because Corey Lewandowski just made a sham of that.\"\n\nShe added: \"If the Democrats wanted to go impeach the president, they should've started that process a long time ago. I don't know what they were looking to get from Corey Lewandowski that they couldn't already get from the Mueller report. They need to drop this. You can't do an impeachment in an election year. It's going to look terrible... they need to figure out a game plan because it's clear, they have no idea how to handle this administration.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats repeatedly asked questions about Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, which said Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller's investigation.\n\nThe report said Trump said that if Sessions would not meet with Lewandowski, then Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired. Lewandowski never delivered the message but asked Dearborn, a former Sessions aide, to do it. Dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and declined to deliver it, according to the report.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "House Democrats apparently had such a rough day\u00a0on Tuesday that even analysts and pundits\u00a0on MSNBC and CNN blasted them over\u00a0their handling\u00a0Corey Lewandowski, which was deemed his hearing a \"failure.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
