Employees enjoy protected employment advantages, while the outsourced people who keep the workspaces running \u2013 who clean them and keep them safe \u2013 often have more precarious roles with inferior terms and conditions.\n\nThe office rental company WeWork has grown into an empire, developing a reputation for trendy workspaces where entrepreneurs and firms can collaborate over craft beers or coffee in light airy lounges. It operates offices in around 100 cities and has around 527,000 members and 528 locations.

(There was a fifth dismissed cleaner involved, but he appears to have been rehired by CCM.)\n\nThe protest \u2013 as with one a week earlier at No 1 Poultry near Bank \u2013 was organised by the Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers Union (CAIWU), which represents more than 1,000 workers, mainly in London\u2019s cleaning industry.\n\nThe union claims the cleaners were unfairly dismissed by CCM shortly after WeWork said it no longer wanted them on its premises. It claims there was insufficient evidence to prove allegations of misconduct made against the cleaners.\n\nAlberto Durango, CAIWU general secretary, said: \u201cEach of the [four] cases was so-called third-party pressure, which is the client \u2013 in this case WeWork \u2013 saying we don\u2019t want these people here. They\u2019re the clients and they requested the removal of these guys. They have the power to say to CCM to reinstate these workers. For a cleaner, they really need their job.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest CAIWU members protest outside WeWork\u2019s offices in One Poultry, near Bank, in the City of London.

The details of their cases vary.\n\nOne, Julian Ortiz, says he asked a member of security at the Paddington branch of WeWork where he worked if he could borrow a projector, and that they agreed. When the company told him the staff member didn\u2019t have the authority to agree to that, he brought the projector back promptly, he says. He was suspended by CCM a few days later, he says. He\u2019s now found part-time work, but misses his old job: \u201cI felt so happy when I was working with WeWork.\u201d\n\nAnother, Jorge Montoya, says his daughter was working at the same WeWork branch that he was, so WeWork requested he be moved to another one. He claims CCM offered him work at another site but later dismissed him.\n\nA third worker, who doesn\u2019t speak fluent English, was cleaning a staircase when someone approached the wet floor, said Durango. \u201cIn broken English he says \u2018don\u2019t pass\u2019\u201d and the person took offence, the CAIWU general secretary said. A fourth cleaner was accused of making a racist remark to a member of staff, a claim he denies.\n\nWhile outsourcing isn\u2019t a new phenomenon, the scale of it is \u2013 it\u2019s one of the biggest growth industries in the past decade. Cleaners, security guards and catering staff at multinational companies, universities, hospitals and other big organisations (including the Guardian) are often employed by other companies.\n\nThe two-tier system means the balance of power at outsourcing firms is firmly in favour of the client: they won\u2019t want to lose a valuable customer. Client companies using outsourced workers often insist in contracts that they retain the right to request a worker be removed, said Molly De Dios of the United Voices of the World union, a large proportion of whose members work in the cleaning sector. And the clients use that right.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, client requests for removal are very common,\u201d said De Dios.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest CAIWU members protest outside the Shoreditch offices of global office rental company WeWork in London.

The union has heard allegations about cleaning companies colluding with clients when they want to get rid of an outsourced worker for a spurious reason without repercussions.\n\nIn some cases there are claims of false accusations, or workers being dismissed simply because someone took a dislike to them. \u201cThe cleaning sector, and the service sector more generally, is a massive migrant labour workforce, and language can be used to manipulate,\u201d said De Dios.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe big issue of outsourcing is workers are completely unprotected against it. Clients often have written into a contract that they have the right to request the removal from site of any worker without having to provide explanations, so the only case that an employer would be liable in that event would be if you could prove that they requested their removal on grounds of discrimination.\u201d\n\nUnited Voices of the World, which is currently involved in seven live disputes in the UK, fights to bring cleaners in-house. \u201cOutsourcing is a complete farce, it shouldn\u2019t exist at all \u2013 it\u2019s terrible,\u201d De Dios said. \u2018\u201cIt leaves workers with fewer rights and it means the clients who are essentially the employer (because the cleaners are cleaning their site) aren\u2019t legally responsible or liable for anything.\u201d\n\nOutsourced workers are treated as a disposable and inferior workforce, said De Dios; she gave the example of a cleaner at a London hospital who was told she couldn\u2019t use the staff room and to eat her lunch on the stairs.\n\nCollege cleaners defeated outsourcing.

She said that in some instances they are not properly investigated and the alternative jobs offered involve a long commute, or fewer hours, or the employee isn\u2019t given long enough to make a decision.\n\nIn the case of the four WeWork cleaners, CCM says two were offered alternative employment that they turned down. However, the CAIWU union claims the workers asked for the details to be sent in writing so they could consider them properly, but were instead told they had declined them.\n\nA CCM Facilities spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cCCM Facilities Limited take matters of this nature very seriously and we have fully investigated these concerns about work place performance and misconduct.\n\n\u201cOf the four individuals, two were offered alternative employment, which was declined in both cases. The two other cases resulted in dismissals, which were both upheld at appeal. To CCM Facilities Ltd[\u2019s] knowledge, none of these individuals have filed employment tribunal cases for unfair dismissal or any other reasons.\u201d\n\nWeWork declined to comment.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Protests in London over four dismissed cleaners highlight a wider problem: modern global multinationals are now often staffed by a two-tier workforce", "authors": ["Claire Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd6c0b73b0b61ae14ed3e2afafee51d01b41a5a/0_225_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db8142bad5340dd93834aa2a4eb3a45b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
