(AP) \u2014 A Virginia judge has blocked the city of Charlottesville's effort to remove Confederate statues.\n\nThe Daily Progress reports the three-day civil trial that ended Friday included a judge's ruling preventing the removal of statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.\n\nThe planned removal of the Lee statue prompted a white nationalist rally in 2017 in which counter protester Heather Heyer was killed.\n\nResidents had sued Charlottesville, citing a state law that protects war memorials. The city said that law violated the U.S. Constitution because the statues send a racist message.\n\nCircuit Court Judge Richard Moore ruled Wednesday that the law's intent was historic preservation not discrimination. He issued a permanent injunction preventing the removal.\n\nMoore said Friday he'll award the plaintiff's attorneys' fees but will weigh arguments before determining the amount.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Progress, http://www.dailyprogress.com", "description": "A Virginia judge has blocked the city of Charlottesville's effort to remove Confederate statues.
