Just ask Tess and Luke, who were also marked down for their poor layout.\n\nHOUSE 4: Matt and El\u2019ise\n\nThe couple\u2019s courtyard impressed the judges with their bamboo, tiles and bench seat, describing it as \u201ctranquil and peaceful\u201d, but they were quick to point out the big garden didn\u2019t add functionality to the floorspace.\n\n\u201cFrom the lounge area it\u2019s spectacular, but I just think when you\u2019re at the dining and kitchen table (inside) you\u2019re not going to see that peaceful serenity, you\u2019re going to get those hard lines,\u201d Shaynna Blaze said, referring to outdoor furniture.\n\n\u201cIf they put a bit more softness across here,\u201d she said while pointing at the courtyard\u2019s seating area, \u201cit will break it up.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Living and dining reveal\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Kitchen and butler\u2019s pantry reveal\n\nDarren Palmer suggested they should have spun the entire courtyard 90 degrees. But obviously that wasn\u2019t going to happen so late in the game.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help this courtyard at all that one quarter of this floor space is a garden bed, so it\u2019s actually not ticking the box for me in terms of added functionality,\u201d Darren said.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what I am looking for today.\u201d\n\nNeale Whitaker jumped in, saying the other courtyards really understood the importance of \u201ctaking the eye upwards\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe others have created visual interest at height, not just so the upper levels of the house have something to look out onto but also because it creates a sense of space and height at ground level too.\u201d\n\nWell, those comments didn\u2019t go down too well with El\u2019ise, who slammed the judges feedback.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked with their thoughts and judging lately,\u201d she said, adding they had got the best landscaper in Australia.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all negative.\n\nThe moment they walked in Darren whispered \u201cshh\u201d to the other two judges.\n\n\u201cListen, did you hear when the wind goes through the bamboo, that lovely calming, rustle sound?\u201d\n\nShaynna responded, \u201cyeah, gorgeous,\u201d as she looked around confused, clearly having no idea what Darren was talking about.\n\nBut they all agreed the courtyard oozed tranquillity and the styling choices were spot on. It was just the functionality that had let them down.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t come last. They came equal third with a score of 26.\n\nHOUSE 1: Mitch and Mark\n\nAfter two weeks of consistent negative feedback, the boys have managed to impress the judges. Last week saw them cop blows left, right and centre over the \u201clack of functionality\u201d in their living and dining reveal.\n\nBut this time, the judges struggled to find a thing to fault.\n\nUpon entering Shaynna said, \u201cThis is just pure joy\u201d. And she said it twice so she really did mean it.\n\nNeale has been banging on about their Palm Spring theme which he said they have failed to deliver throughout the house.\n\nHowever, he described their courtyard as having a \u201cVegas feel\u201d. Neale, what\u2019s it going to be?\n\n\u201cI know I have been saying Palm Springs these past few weeks but maybe now were in Vegas,\u201d he said, pointing to the boys\u2019 massive, neon Oslo sign.\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Master ensuite reveal\n\nRELATED: The Block 2019: Formal lounge reveal\n\nThe judges loved the leaves and although they were fake, they were \u201cgood fake\u201d, unlike their faux windows from a few weeks ago.\n\nDarren thought the boys had delivered on consistency, bringing the brick work from the lounge room to the court yard.\n\n\u201cYou get that real Miami colour palette of blue and white and I like their touches of pink,\u201d Darren said.\n\nThey all thought the graphic wallprint added to the Colorbond cladding, describing it as just \u201cgenius\u201d.\n\n\u201cLook at these palm trees Shaynna,\u201d Neale demanded.\n\n\u201cAs if this courtyard doesn\u2019t have height enough then to use those trees which just goes soaring up above us.\u201d\n\nThe judges also commended them on their dining and seating space and for having a \u201cproper barbecue\u201d which they said is perfect for their \u201cparty house\u201d.\n\nNeale said he had started to worry the boys had lost their sense of humour but Shaynna said \u201cnot at all\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf anything, they were laughing at us.\u201d\n\nWell, the judges tune changed big time compared to last week\u2019s reveal.\n\nShaynna described the room as \u201cshowtime, an unapologetic space, with great confidence and a sense of fun\u201d.\n\nThe boys missed out on the top spot by half a point with a score of 29.\n\nHOUSE 2: Tess and Luke\n\nOver at Tess and Luke\u2019s place, the judges were back on their favourite topic \u2014 functionality.\n\nShaynna loved the colour palette and all the judges liked the staircase, however they felt having no barbecue or soft furnishings was a problem.\n\n\u201cI was expecting a really big table\u201d, Shaynna said, \u201clike a 10 seater.\u201d\n\nDarren noticed there was no place to sit that was upholested or a place to lay down, relax and read a book.\n\nThen Shaynna questioned why they didn\u2019t have a barbecue and unfortunately for Tess and Luke, they considered it but they had no cash.\n\n\u201cSo if they want to make this (courtyard) about dining and entertaining, then wouldn\u2019t you want a barbecue out here as well?\u201d Shaynna asked.\n\nBut again, it wasn\u2019t all bad \u2014 in fact this week the judges appeared to be in a much better mood, offering plenty of positive feedback.\n\n\u201cWhen you look around at the budget things they have got in here, other than sponsors, they haven\u2019t really spent a lot,\u201d Shaynna said.\n\n\u201cBut I think that\u2019s one of their big credits,\u201d Darren added.\n\nNeale said stylistically they\u2019re on track.\n\n\u201cIt looks great, so all is not lost. But they have just got to address the functionality,\u201d he said.\n\nDarren praised the use of textures.\n\n\u201cThey have played with textures on a neutral dark pallet and then sculptural items, like these (gold) pots, the (dark) spiral staircase, the heating dome and even this golden rio that\u2019s making its way up the wall.\u201d\n\nEven though the judges balanced out the negative with the positive, it still wasn\u2019t enough to give Tess and Luke a high score. They came last at 24.5\n\nHOUSE 3: Andy and Deb\n\nThe judges gasped as they walked in to Andy and Deb\u2019s courtyard.\n\n\u201cAh, this is a chilled space,\u201d Darren said. \u201cIt\u2019s so relaxed and light.\u201d\n\nHe said the massive feature wall was the perfect choice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lighter colour but you still get this lovely linear element, it drives your eye upward.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I think it\u2019s absolutely seamless the way this flows on from the kitchen, living and dining,\u201d Neale said.\n\n\u201cI think it has been done beautifully as we have come to expect from Andy and Deb.\u201d\n\nShaynna thought the way they had planned the space was very good, adding how she would use the area.\n\n\u201cI immediately thought I could put my yoga mat out here.\u201d Good idea Shaynna.\n\nBut Neale thought what they had delivered was a bit light on \u201ccomfort\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all hard edges; This isn\u2019t a comfortable space to be in.\u201d\n\nDarren agreed that the buyer is going to want to get a dining table and probably a sofa and there clearly was space for all that.\n\n\u201cEverything I see, I love. I love the panelling leading up to the Romeo and juliet balcony. I love the vertical wall garden, but I love it\u2019s not just clumped together, it\u2019s spaced out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely inner city oasis and it will only get better with time.\u201d\n\nNeale agreed there was a lot to love, but there was also a lot more he wishes was in the courtyard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite right.\u201d\n\nNot all doom and gloom for Andy and Deb with a score of 26.\n\nHOUSE 5: Jesse and Mel (Winners)\n\nAs the saying goes \u2014 they saved the best for last. But it also just happens to be the order of judging.\n\nJesse and Mel delivered a \u201dspectacular\u201d courtyard that had the judges in awe and fell just half a point short of a perfect score.\n\nSo what was so special about it? Well, a lot of it had to do with Jesse and Mel laying 105,215 tiles by hand, to form their feature wall.\n\n\u201cWhat, they did it themselves?\u201d a surprised Neale asked.\n\n\u201cI swear to God, having to get a professional to do that, would take forever. They\u2019re mosaic sheets, each one of those is only 30cm by 30cm but imagine putting it up on that wall \u2026\u201d Darren said, completely gobsmacked.\n\nNeale said he had never seen tiles used to such great effect. \u201cThe height, the grander, the magnificence of that is incredible,\u201d\n\nThe judges kept raving on about he tiles using words such as \u201cspectacular\u201d and \u201castonishing\u201d, before they finally moved on to other areas of the courtyard.\n\nIt would have been a perfect room reveal, until Shaynna spotted some missing details \u2014 no heater or speakers.\n\nBut she said it didn\u2019t matter \u201cbecause everything they have created here is more important than those few inclusion\u201d.\n\nBut not for Darren \u2014 it was make or break.\n\n\u201cIt changes the usability from a seasonal, all-year round, to only when it\u2019s warm enough and I think a heater in Melbourne is a very smart inclusion and fact they haven\u2019t put it in \u2026\u201d\n\nYes, the fact they hadn\u2019t put it in earned them a score of 29.5, instead of 30.\n\nBut they won for the second week in a row.\n\nSCOREBOARD:\n\nMitch and Mark: 29\n\nTess and Luke: 24.5\n\nAndy and Deb: 26\n\nMatt and Elise: 26\n\nJesse and Mel: 29.5 (Winners)\n\nThe Block airs tomorrow at 7pm on Channel 9.", "description": "It\u2019s the F word that has no doubt scarred Mitch and Mark after the Bondi boys copped a beating for their living and dining reveal last week.", "authors": ["Shireen Khalil"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/673d27bd50a9afff7e4278664e2a74b2?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
