Could the truth about his violent behaviour finally be revealed?\n\nEarlier this week, Gray revealed to Keegan (Zack Morris) that Karen (Lorraine Stanley) knew Dinah was planning on taking her own life \u2014 a revelation which left the Taylor clan reeling. Chantelle was understandably upset with her husband, and proceeded to inform him that it wasn\u2019t his place to reveal such information.\n\nA fuming Gray then made a beeline for his wife \u2014 the aggression evident in his face \u2014 but Chantelle pleaded with him to stop \u2014 reminding him about her pregnancy. Instead of taking his anger out on her, Gray punched the nearby worktop, and made it clear that he would never hurt their unborn child, before storming out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight\u2019s episode saw Chantelle become worried, as Gray hadn\u2019t returned home on the night in question. However, he did so the following day, and Chantelle voiced her concerns about where he was and what had happened the previous night. Gray was quick to ease her worries, telling her that he simply stayed the night at work, before the pair made up once more.\n\nHowever, Gray\u2019s problems were far from over as, later in the episode, two police officers \u2014 one of whom was Jack (Scott Maslen) \u2014 arrived on his doorstep. Curious, Gray quizzed the two officers what their unannounced arrival was in aid of, and they made it clear that they wanted to ask him some questions \u2018about last night.\u2019\n\nA nervous Gray stepped aside to the let them in, and \u2014 as he did so \u2014 the worry was incredibly evident on his face, as he peered around the Square to make sure nobody saw what was happening.\n\nWhat is it that the police want from Gray?\n\nIt seems as if the solicitor is hiding something about what transpired the night before \u2014 but just what happened?\n\nWe know that he has extreme anger issues, so did he perhaps let his aggression get the better of him once more?\n\nThe big question is: via their questioning, will the police discover that Gray\u2019s been abusing his wife?\n\nEastEnders continues on Friday 11th October at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Gray's got some explaining to do.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gray-gets-questioned-by-the-police-eastenders_1570727671.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
