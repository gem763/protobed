Fitbit shares rose 27 per cent on the news. (Reuters)\n\nTalking point: Google has lagged behind competitors like Apple and Samsung in the wearables market. In 2016, the firm reportedly cancelled plans for a Pixel smartwatch over concerns the final product didn\u2019t live up to the Google hardware brand; it hasn\u2019t developed a flagship wearable since. In January, it bought Fossil\u2019s smartwatch intellectual property for US$40 million, though it\u2019s unclear exactly what those assets were or what Google plans to do with them. Fitbit had 12.2 per cent of the global smartwatch market in 2018, compared to Apple\u2019s 50 per cent and Samsung\u2019s 11.8 per cent, according to Strategy Analytics.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
