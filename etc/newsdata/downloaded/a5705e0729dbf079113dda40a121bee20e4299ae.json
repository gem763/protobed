Within days of taking office, it sold a 7-year-bond at a record low yield of 1.9 percent.\n\nIt was the third bond sale this year, a first since Greece\u2019s economic crisis erupted in 2010.\n\nGreece has also requested to repay 2.8 billion euros in IMF loans before to save interest rate costs.\n\nAfter a decade-long crisis, painful reforms and 289 billion euros ($330 billion) in rescue loans, the country exited its third and final international bailout in August 2018.", "description": "Athens (AFP) \u2013 Greece expects its economy to grow by 2.8 percent in 2020 whilst respecting fiscal pledges to the country\u2019s creditors, a draft", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/933e84_greece-is-slowly-emerging-economic-crisis-greek-economy-grow-pct-in-2020-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
