I don\u2019t know how I did it all.\n\n\"He\u2019s my favourite person. If I go there I could get really teary eyed \u2014 he\u2019s literally the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"It\u2019s nice to be back in London after having these traumatic experiences. I do feel that he\u2019s with me.\u201d\n\nShe now hopes that talking about bipolar disorder will help to demystify the \"complicated, confusing illness\".\n\nShe also wants to \u201cget rid of the judgement and stigma\u201d around suicide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really out of their control, like cancer\", she said.\n\n\"It\u2019s not their fault.\"\n\nShe added: \"I don\u2019t want him to have died in vain. I would love to help others by being honest and transparent about what I\u2019m going through.\u201d\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nRicki also talked about the trauma of witnessing the second plane hit the World Trade Center in 2001 while she cradled her son Milo, then four.\n\nIt was a moment of clarity for her, and she thought to herself: \"If I live through this day, I\u2019m leaving New York and leaving my job and leaving my husband.\"\n\nThen in 2010, she narrowly escaped a huge house fire started by a decorative indoor flame which caught her sofa on fire.\n\n\"The whole house was gone in 15 minutes\", she said.\n\n\u201cWe ran out of the house with my two children and my dog at seven in the morning, with the clothes on our back. I had no bra, I had no shoes on. It was incredibly traumatising.\u201d\n\nRicki also talked about her belief that discussing traumatic events helps you to get over them, which is why she told the story of when she was sexually assaulted as a child by a worker in her parent's house.\n\n\u201cThis was the late 1970s and it wasn\u2019t talked about. You push everything under the rug\", she explained.\n\n(Image: Barry J. Holmes)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because that experience of being taken advantage of as a little girl is what caused me to turn to food, which is what caused me to be obese, which is what caused me to get the biggest break of my life in Hairspray.\n\n\"So again, trauma \u2014 I ended up turning it into a gift and a positive.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cObviously I wished that never happened to me. Once you unleash this secret it isn\u2019t such a big deal, and that was pretty healing.\u201d\n\nRicki has gone from eight stone to 14 stone over the years, and is now at a healthy weight.\n\nShe is now in a relationship with eco fashion designer Jeff Scult, who she met through a mutual friend.\n\n(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)\n\n\"I\u2019m in a beautiful relationship with this amazing man, I feel very in touch with my body\", she said.\n\n\u201cHe walked in and he reminded me of my husband. There\u2019s an essence and a quality about him\", she said.\n\n\"And it took him a little while to see me that way but I wore him down.\u201d\n\nIn X Factor: Celebrity, Ricki will be singing Us by James Bay as a tribute to her late ex husband.\n\n* The X Factor: Celebrity returns to ITV tomorrow night", "description": "The chat show host talked frankly about the horrifying trauma she has endured, and what it inspired her to do", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Itv", "Rex Features", "Pa", "Barry J.
