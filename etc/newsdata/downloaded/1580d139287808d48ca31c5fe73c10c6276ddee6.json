One is to cause disruption and financial costs to the state to build pressure for political change. Another is for individuals to show their commitment \u2013 that they are willing to sacrifice their liberty for the cause. Increased disruption and more people arrested creates a bigger impact.\n\nThe training explains the possible legal implications of getting arrested. Once people have been informed about this, it is up to them to decide if they are willing to get arrested or not. If they sign up, they become part of the growing list of arrestables.\n\nFi Radford, 71, retired academic librarian from Bristol\n\n\n\n\u201cI got to London and joined the rebellion at lunchtime Thursday [during protests in April], and I was looking for my affinity group in Oxford Circus by the pink boat when I saw a guy I know from Bristol. I told him, \u2018I have just arrived and I am willing to be arrested.\u2019\n\n\u201cA police officer behind me heard me say that and he tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u2018I think I can arrange that. Are you aware this is a section 14? Please leave the area. I am officially asking you to move away or I will have to arrest you.\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him I was not going anywhere and he then read a caution and my rights. I sat down to make clear I was not moving. He was on his own so he had to go away to get more police and came back after a while with three colleagues who picked me up and carried me away. There was a lot of clapping and cheering as they carried me down the road to the van. We were four in the van and they took us to West End Central where there was a long queue of people waiting to get processed.\n\n\u201cI was then searched and had my fingerprints and DNA taken, and was put in a cell. Everyone was very nice and polite and at 9pm I was given a toothbrush and paste and was fed twice, vegetarian food. The cell was very bright so I had to pull the blanket over my face to get some sleep and I read a detective novel given to me by the custody officer. I was let out at 2pm.\n\n\u201cI feel my time is running out and the world\u2019s time is running out and what energy I have got left I will spend on fighting climate change, not just for my children and grandchildren but also for the non-human world.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to be able to use my privilege as a white elderly woman this way and I will be back in London in October.\u201d\n\nRadford was charged under section 14 and was given a conditional discharge with a \u00a370 fine.\n\nJamie Osborn, 24, charity press officer from Norwich\n\nIn February, Osborn, who is also a city councillor and press officer for a Green MEP, and eight other XR activists walked into the county council chamber in Norwich. Osborn says he felt peaceful direct action was the only way to stop a proposed new road, the Norwich Western Link. For four hours, the activists sang and stood arm in arm wearing T-shirts that read: \u201cNCC guilty of ecocide \u2013 care not cars.\u201d\n\nThe councillors first asked them to leave, then switched the lights off and left, pretending the meeting was over, and later played Rule Britannia through loudspeakers to drown out the singing.\n\nOsborn was arrested and charged. He accepted a caution and was released without further action. His conviction was later quashed.\n\nRuth Jarman, 56, full-time campaigner\n\n\n\n\u201cI just want to take action that is more commensurate with the seriousness of the situation we are in,\u201d says Jarman, who has been arrested seven times. \u201cI want to know I have done everything I can \u2013 when you are in a police cell, you know there is nothing more you can do but pray. And you then have plenty of time to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cCivil disobedience seems the only moral choice. When the laws and policies of the land are actively destroying what God has made and my children\u2019s future, when ordinary campaigning has failed, when all we need to do to allow climate breakdown is for everyone to carry on their lawful daily business, civil disobedience seems the only moral choice.\n\n\u201cThe theory shows you need arrests, you need people prepared to go to prison \u2013 someone has to be those people. Why shouldn\u2019t I be one of them?\u201d\n\nThe Rev Sue Parfitt, 77, from Bristol\n\nParfitt was arrested in April at Oxford Circus. \u201cI was very well treated during my arrest,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing part of XR I realised being elderly is a great privilege and we have to offer ourselves as arrestables and be on the frontline. We get our pensions and have no jobs or careers to worry about.\n\n\u201cThe moment when you become most vulnerable, putting yourself in the hands of the state, is when you have most power.\u201d\n\nParfitt is not aware of any court summons and is planning to take part in this week\u2019s action in London.\n\nSamantha Lindo, 33, singer and mental health teacher for young people\n\n\u201cIt was on the last day of the occupation of Waterloo Bridge during the international rebellion in April \u2026 we listened to a Brazilian indigenous woman speaking about how she and her fellow activists in the Amazon faced violence and death in their struggles. I felt the need to stand with her in solidarity and was inspired by all the women around me on the bridge, so later as the police were clearing the road I decided to join in and stand my ground, refusing to move on.\n\n\u201cI was with my husband and we had decided only one of us should be arrested, so he was with me but on the pavement, and he waved goodbye. I was arrested at 8.30pm and held in custody for 21 hours. I tried not to make too much fuss, apologised to the police for taking up their time and made a \u2018non-comment\u2019 interview. I still do believe I did the right thing in the light of what we are facing, and when I was in court I read out a prepared statement on that which got me a round of applause.\u201d\n\nLindo was was fined \u00a3100 and given a conditional discharge.\n\nPhil Kingston, 83, retired probation officer and lecturer in social work at Bristol University\n\nKingston was arrested for his part in a protest disrupting the DLR at Canary Wharf in April.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really very hard for many elders to break the law, because of the culture we have been brought up in \u2013 unlike younger people now,\u201d he says. \u201cThe things I do, I do for my grandchildren and other lifeforms and future generations. Whatever the future situation, I hope we will learn to live a very different way of life to what we have learned under capitalism.\u201d\n\nKingston is facing a crown court trial in early 2020.\n\nTony Goodchild, 74, retired veterinary epidemiologist\n\n\u201cI was standing alone on the pavement near Parliament Square outside the supreme court building,\u201d says Goodchild. \u201cI wanted to test the law. I was approached by two police officers. The male officer suggested I go to Marble Arch, \u2018where I could have fun\u2019, or words to that effect. I felt this advice to be insulting, because I was protesting against something seriously dangerous: the UK government\u2019s lack of action against climate change.\n\n\u201cI replied: \u2018Three hundred of my colleagues have been arrested already \u2013 why should I be any different?\u2019\n\n\u201cOne of the officers patted me down and found an open pin badge in one of my pockets, which was her reason for handcuffing me.\n\n\u201cAfter a night in a cold cell with noisy ventilation I had fingerprints, photos and DNA taken for processing and was then released with a letter saying I was under investigation. The police have sent me an invitation for interview. I\u2019ve ignored it, but they\u2019ve taken no further action.\u201d\n\n\n\nGoodchild has since been given a nine-month suspended sentence and must pay a total of \u00a3640 in costs.\n\nBryn Raven, 75, retired English teacher, yoga teacher and shiatsu therapist\n\nRaven was arrested in April in Parliament Square.\n\n\u201cI had slept overnight on the roadblock we had created across Parliament Street with about seven students from UEA and Leeds, as well as the guy who had been up the tree,\u201d she says. \u201cWe knew the police were intent on clearing all the road obstructions, and had cleared the one closest to the Houses of Parliament the previous evening . It had been a highly moving experience. The police were visibly moved by the singing, cheering, and peaceful supportive conduct of all present.\n\n\u201cThe students were already lying together linked by hands in a metal tube, another had glued his hand to the outside of the tube. I said I would like to join them, lay down and glued my right hand to the other end of the tube. A legal observer was present.\n\n\u201cI was told that my hand was going to be unstuck by a special PC who used acetone and a soft toothbrush. He did this very gently, finger by finger and then the palm, releasing my hand.\n\n\u201cFour officers organised themselves to carry me. I was totally limp. They had to put me down twice before they got to the police van. They were careful and gentle.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t fault the police in their handling of the situation; I hope their exposure to peaceful protest has gone deeper than their uniforms. Nor can I praise XR enough for providing such a supportive, caring network for all arrestees and for modelling a different way of doing things so well.\n\n\u201cI was thanked so many times by complete strangers for being arrested. I feel humbled by this, and glad that I have been able to use my freedom and privilege to act in a small way to stand up and be counted. My grandson calls me gangster gran.\u201d\n\nReggie Norton, 85, retired lawyer from Oxfordshire\n\nNorton was arrested in November after a protest at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\n\u201cI got into the lobby where I was arrested for spray-chalk painting six XR symbols on the glass walls,\u201d he says. \u201cI got in at 1.30pm and was arrested and taken out at 6pm. I was taken to Charing Cross station where they asked me to fill in forms and when they saw my age they told me to go home. I was later officially charged by letter with damage to the tune of \u00a35,000.\n\n\u201cIt was a long time after my arrest and two witnesses said the paint had been wiped off straight away so no damage was done. At the first court hearing we pleaded not guilty. We were then given a court date but our solicitor told us other defendants in a similar case had their case discontinued. A few days before we were due in court the CPS let us all know our case was dropped.\n\n\u201cWe have been called dangerous anarchists, but that is obviously not true. What we want is our government to do what is required to control the change in the climate for the safety and security of the country and the world at large.\u201d\n\nCathy Eastburn, 52, musician\n\nPhotograph: Tomm Morton/Extenction Rebellion\n\nEastburn joined XR as she became increasingly concerned about the trajectory of the climate crisis and lack of action from the government. Until that point, she had never done anything similar and initially joined in a supporting role, but soon decided to become an arrestable.\n\n\u201cPutting myself in harm\u2019s way and risking arrest is really not a big deal compared with what other people are going through around the world and compared with what is coming for our children,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel a very strong sense of duty and that it\u2019s my turn to step up.\u201d\n\nIn February 2019, Eastburn took part in her first direct action, during an oil conference attended by the then trade secretary, Liam Fox. In April, during the widespread London protests, Eastburn superglued herself to the roof of a DLR train.\n\nShe is facing a crown court trial in December for her DLR protest.", "description": "UK-based activists from the climate campaign group explain why they are prepared to be arrested for the cause", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d693ab02f9612c8c22bf55b0add0281527e00b9/171_0_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9081dcd13dd8f1cfbae352bf53d9e263", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
