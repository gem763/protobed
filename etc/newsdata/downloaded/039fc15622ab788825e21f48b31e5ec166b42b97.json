If you type this into the database, you can see their name and full address and what benefits they are claiming no matter where in the country they are living.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cNot having properly working mechanisms in place to hide the NI numbers is a systemic failing and the result of authorities not understanding the extreme danger these women are in.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they understand two women a week in the UK are murdered by current or ex-partners and domestic abuse murders are at a five-year high. These women\u2019s lives are at risk.\u201d\n\nIn her letter to Home Secretary Priti Patel, Dame Vera said a \u201cfailure of bureaucracy\u201d is \u201cinadvertently leading to victims\u2019 lives being put at risk\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cI was very concerned to read the following piece in The Independent about victims of domestic abuse being traced by their abusers.\n\n\u201cIt seems that perpetrators who have their victim\u2019s NI number are able to share this with people who have access to the database which brings up the victim\u2019s current address, enabling them to be found.\n\n\u201cClearly the current system is open to abuse but the problem could be stopped by allowing victims to more easily change their NI number so that their former partners cannot use this method to find them. However, it seems that changing your NI number is not straightforward and the article above mentions that staff on the NI helpline do not even know the correct form to use to make this change.\u201d\n\nWomen are most at danger of being murdered at the point of fleeing from an abusive former partner or after escaping, statistics show.", "description": "Domestic abuse victims should be able to change their National Insurance (NI) numbers\u00a0to prevent\u00a0their abusive ex-partners tracking them down, the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales has said.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/20/18/Vera-Baird.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
