The offensive has created a new refugee crisis in a region where some 1.6 million people already rely on humanitarian aid.\n\nBefore the offensive, a camp in the northern town of Ein Eissa held an estimated 12,000 displaced people, including around 1,000 wives and widows of Islamic State fighters and their children. But rioting broke out as Turkish-led forces closed in over the weekend, leading to the escape of hundreds of Islamic State supporters.\n\nSonia Khush, the Syria response director at Save the Children, which was operating in the camp, now says it is \u201cnearly empty,\u201d with most of the residents having fled further south and the IS supporters melting away. She said the aid group can no longer access its office in Ein Eissa, and that most of its local staff have themselves been displaced.\n\n\u201cWe have to leave as the battle lines change,\u201d she said.\n\nTurkish troops and allied Syrian fighters invaded northern Syria a week ago after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled back U.S. troops who had partnered with Syrian Kurdish forces in the costly five-year war against the Islamic State group. Turkey views the Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to the decades-long insurgency in its southeast.\n\nAbandoned by their U.S. allies, the Kurds turned to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russia for protection , and over the past two days Syrian and Russian forces have moved into several towns and villages as the U.S. has pulled its remaining troops from the region.\n\nSo far, most of the displacement has been within northern Syria, but hundreds of refugees have crossed into Iraq in the past week, mostly through unofficial border points. On Wednesday, a first group of 890 people were bused to a camp in Bardarash, in northern Iraq\u2019s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, which up until two years ago housed displaced people from the Iraqi city of Mosul.\n\n\u201cWhere can go except here?\u201d said Omar Boobe Hose, a refugee from the northern Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn, which has seen heavy fighting. \u201cWe can\u2019t go to Turkey, because they are our enemy, and the other side is also our enemy, the Syrian (government) side. Where can we go? We have only here. There are no other places for Kurds.\u201d\n\nDoctors Without Borders, which operates in war zones around the globe and is known by its French acronym MSF, said Tuesday it had decided to suspend most of its activities and evacuate all its international staff from northeastern Syria.\n\n\u201cThe highly unpredictable and fast-changing situation at present has made it impossible for MSF to negotiate safe access to deliver healthcare and provide humanitarian assistance to people in distress,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cGiven the numerous groups fighting on different sides of the conflict, MSF can no longer guarantee the safety of our Syrian and international staff.\u201d\n\nThe International Rescue Committee also said it has suspended its health operations in the northeast because of \u201chostilities and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nIt said an apparent airstrike hit a \u201ctrauma stabilization point\u201d run by a local organization and that two of that group\u2019s ambulances were damaged despite being clearly marked. It said the local group\u2019s ambulances get fired upon every time they approach Ras al-Ayn, preventing them from reaching the town.\n\n\u201cMany hospitals have had to close and those that remain open are overwhelmed with casualties,\u201d the IRC said. At least 42 people have been killed, including three children, since hostilities began Oct. 9, and another 123 people have been wounded, it said.\n\nIn Hassakeh, one of the main cities in the northeast, schools are being transformed into shelters, and some residents are opening their homes to displaced people. The city\u2019s main water station was damaged in the fighting, and the International Committee of the Red Cross and other groups are working to maintain supplies for hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nA woman from Ein Eissa said she fled with her family after an explosion near their home made her children cry.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I took our kids, left the house and walked for hours,\u201d she told the ICRC, saying the journey took two days because they couldn\u2019t afford to rent a car. \u201cNow we are staying in this school, where we feel a bit safer. But we brought no food, no water, no mattresses.\u201d\n\nKarl Schembri, a spokesman for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the escalating violence makes it difficult to deliver aid to the hundreds of thousands of people depending on it.\n\n\u201cIt has become unsafe for humanitarian workers to carry out much of their daily work and has made several displacement camps outside of the reach of aid agencies,\u201d he said. The warring parties \u201cneed to guarantee that aid workers and civilians will not be targeted.\u201d\n\nSave the Children and other aid agencies are still operating in areas farther from the front lines, including the al-Hol camp near the Iraqi border, where tens of thousands of IS family members are being held. But as Syrian government forces move in many of the biggest international aid providers will have to withdraw because they are not registered in Damascus.\n\n\u201cThere will be a huge impact on where we\u2019re able to access in the northeast,\u201d Khush said. \u201cAs we leave areas and government-registered agencies come in there\u2019s always a gap in services in the transition period.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKrauss reported from Jerusalem.", "description": "BARDARASH, Iraq (AP) \u2014 Humanitarian groups in northeastern Syria are scrambling to provide aid to hundreds of thousands of people as rapidly shifting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/307b89_aptopix-iraq-syria-91826-syrian-woman-who-is-newly-displaced-by-turkish-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
