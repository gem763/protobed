USA TODAY\n\nST. LOUIS \u2014 This National League Championship Series isn\u2019t so much a battle for the pennant as it is an antidote to Major League Baseball\u2019s numbing predictivity.\n\nTired of a landscape that produced 10 90-game losers, more than half the playoff field returning intact and a slew of front offices potentially too smart for the game\u2019s competitive good?\n\nCast your eyes toward the Washington Nationals and St. Louis Cardinals, then, and behold a pair of teams that didn\u2019t exactly shock the baseball world \u2013 but undeniably jolted its modern hierarchy.\n\nAs Friday\u2019s Game 1 approaches, these teams may well regard the other and ask, \"Just what are you doing here?\"\n\nThey arrive on the highest highs, surviving Game 5 Division Series in fashions befitting their unforeseen rises. The Nationals erased their second eighth-inning deficit in an elimination game in eight days to stun the 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers with a three-homer barrage in a 9-5, 10-inning win.\n\nTen was a lucky number for the Cardinals, too \u2013 their record-setting run total in the first inning of their Game 5 throttling of an Atlanta Braves team that finished four games ahead of the Nationals in the NL East, relegating Washington to wild-card status.\n\nKolten Wong turns a double play as Trea Turner slides in during a game at Busch Stadium in September. (Photo: Jeff Curry, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThose facts are now happily irrelevant, as the Nationals are on a staggering 78-40 run since their famously grim 19-31 start and advanced past the NLDS for the first time in five tries.\n\nSo, too, is the Cardinals\u2019 third-place standing as late as Aug. 7, before they finished on a 33-16 run to end the Cubs\u2019 five-year playoff run and bypass defending NL Central champ Milwaukee, too.\n\nNow, it is a matchup of two gloriously flawed teams, Washington pitting its three aces and shaky bullpen against St. Louis\u2019 Cy Young stud, uneven offense and NL-best relief corps. What next?\n\nFoolish as it may be to forecast these clubs\u2019 next moves, here\u2019s what could go down:\n\nFor starters\n\nProjected rotations\n\nGame 1: RHP Anibal Sanchez (11-8, 3.85 ERA) vs. RHP Miles Mikolas (9-14, 4.16)\n\nGame 2: RHP Max Scherzer (11-7, 2.92 ERA) vs. RHP Adam Wainwright (14-10, 4.19)\n\nGame 3: Stephen Strasburg (18-6, 3.32) vs. RHP Jack Flaherty (11-8, 2.75)\n\nGame 4: Patrick Corbin (14-7, 3.25) vs. RHP Dakota Hudson (16-7, 3.35)\n\nAfter the timely off days and best-of-five NLDS format, both rotations will be forced to stretch out a bit more in this best-of-seven. At least initially.\n\nGame 3 will be the one to watch, as Cy Young candidates Strasburg and Flaherty square off in a game that will either put a club up 2-1 or down 3-0. Should the Nationals lose that one, manager Dave Martinez may have to ponder bringing Scherzer back on three days\u2019 rest in Game 5. For now, Martinez won\u2019t commit to a rotation beyond Sanchez in Game 1.\n\nALCS: Houston gives the people want they want \u2013 an Astros-Yankees showdown\n\nNATIONALS: Zimmerman credits Strasburg's 2012 shutdown\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 front four account for some $550 million in guaranteed money and certainly earned it this month, with Strasburg making a crucial bullpen appearance in the Nationals wild-card game comeback and Scherzer and Corbin combining for three relief appearances in the NLDS.\n\nBut the Cardinals\u2019 quartet was even better in quieting a dominant Atlanta offense, holding the Braves to a .214 batting average, pitching to a 1.78 ERA with a 28-8 strikeout-walk ratio.\n\n\u201cI think it's going to make for some really exciting October baseball,\u201d Mikolas said Thursday. \u201cYou've got Cy Young award winners, guys who are probably going to win Cy Young awards, all stars, franchise icons, I mean, the list goes on and on.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals will need to be just as precise against the Nationals.\n\nCheckers and chess\n\nThe Cardinals just matched up with a Braves lineup that was dangerous from both sides of the plate and alternated right- and left-handed batters from one through eight.\n\nWashington poses a similar challenge through its first five spots, from power-speed leadoff demon Trea Turner all the way through Game 5 grand slam hero Howie Kendrick. And lurking in the 3-4 hole are the for now unstoppable Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto.\n\nRendon, perpetually overshadowed, got the go-ahead single in a Game 4 win and started the Game 5 tying rally with a homer off Clayton Kershaw \u2013 followed by a Soto blast a pitch later.\n\nRendon and Soto are a combined 13 for 42 (.310) this postseason, with on-base percentages of .385 and .423, respectively. They will pose a particularly difficult matchup in the late innings \u2013 just watch how the Dodgers bungled that in Game 5 \u2013 and magnify the import of lefty reliever Andrew Miller, who pitched a pair of hitless innings in the NLDS.\n\n\u201cThey're tough because they're plate-disciplined more than anything. They\u2019re not going to help you out,\u201d says Cardinals catcher Matt Wieters, who spent 2017-18 with the Nationals. \u201cIt\u2019s about executing.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals, meanwhile, may need to re-think their bullpen usage. They\u2019ve preferred using erstwhile closer Sean Doolittle in the eighth and Daniel Hudson in the ninth of late, which worked out well against the Dodgers, as the southpaw Doolittle matched up well against their lefty-heavy lineup.\n\nBut should it be tight and close in the seventh or eighth innings, the Nationals may want to consider tabbing Hudson earlier to attack righty-swinging Paul Goldschmidt, Marcell Ozuna and Paul DeJong, who combined for 93 homers in the regular season and four in the NLDS.\n\nKeep an eye on\n\nDave Martinez: The Nationals manager pushed almost all the right buttons in the NLDS, ultimately outmaneuvering more celebrated Dodgers counterpart Dave Roberts. He intentionally put the tying run on base in Game 2 and lived to tell about it, while his relief gambit with Scherzer that same game locked down a must win. After the Dodgers wore down Strasburg in Game 5, Martinez stole just enough outs from Tanner Rainey and Corbin \u2013 who rebounded from a Game 3 relief disaster \u2013 to preserve trusted relievers Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle for the ninth and 10th innings. Martinez was much maligned in his first year as Nationals manager and seemingly on the hot seat after their poor start this season but is running these playoff games with conviction \u2013 and his players are responding in kind.\n\nAdam Wainwright: At 38, Wainwright is not the dominant dude who took star turns as a closer and ace on Cardinals World Series championship teams in 2006 and 2011. Yet he proved in Game 3 of the NLDS that he can still carry them when it counts, holding Atlanta to four hits over 7 \u2154 innings and 120 pitches. Now, he\u2019ll match up at least once with Scherzer, and with Cards ace Flaherty perhaps neutralized by Strasburg in Game 3, Wainwright will probably need to outpitch Scherzer at some point or St. Louis is in trouble.\n\nIn the end\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to call this series a coin flip, but then again, coin flips are relatively easy to forecast. All signs point to a tightly-pitched, well played and possibly low-scoring series. It\u2019s hard to side against the Nationals\u2019 mojo, particularly after they\u2019ve run off three wins in elimination games already.\n\nBut the Cardinals put together an excellent pitching plan against the Braves and have the horses to cool the Nationals\u2019 simmering bats. Throw in superior marks in the bullpen and defensively, and it\u2019s enough little things that add up to the smallest of advantages.\n\nCardinals in 6.", "description": "After thrilling series in the last round, the Cardinals and Nationals face off in the National League Championship Series.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
