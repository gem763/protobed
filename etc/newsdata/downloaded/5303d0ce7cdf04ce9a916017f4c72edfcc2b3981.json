The Sky had one last chance, but Astou Ndour\u2019s 3-pointer from the corner after a timeout was off.\n\nLas Vegas will play Washington in the best-of-five semifinals that begin Tuesday.\n\nHamby admitted after the game that she didn\u2019t know how much time was left when she released her go-ahead basket.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize we had so much time on the clock,\u201d said Hamby, who won the league\u2019s Sixth Woman of the Year award before the game. \u201cHad I missed it, I never would have been able to live with it. So glad we won.\u201d\n\nLiz Cambage had 23 points, 17 rebounds and six blocks, Hamby finished with 17 points, Kayla McBride scored 16 and Kelsey Plum 15 for Las Vegas.
