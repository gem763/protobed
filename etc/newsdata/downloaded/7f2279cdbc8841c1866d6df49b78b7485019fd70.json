(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\nTom Brady has denied that his cameo in Netflix\u2019s Paul Rudd series Living With Yourself is poking fun at Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The quarterback is seen leaving the \u201cTop Happy Spa\u201d in a strip mall in the show, asking Rudd\u2019s character if it\u2019s his first time there before revealing it\u2019s his sixth \u2014 a reference to the number of Super Bowls he\u2019s won.\n\nTom Brady makes interesting cameo in Paul Rudd's Netflix show, \u2018Living With Yourself\u2019 pic.twitter.com/h5DlzWa5O2 \u2014 PatriotsNation\u2122 (@PatsNationTM) October 19, 2019\n\nThe clip has raised eyebrows over the spa\u2019s apparent similarity to the strip mall massage parlor Kraft was allegedly busted at in Florida and charged with soliciting prostitution. (Kraft pleaded not guilty, and his case is ongoing.) But Brady told ESPN that the scene is being taken \u201cout of context.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what that was about,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was taken out of context, just like you\u2019re taking it out of context and trying to make it a story for yourself, which has a negative connotation to it, which I don\u2019t appreciate. It was meant to be something different than that. The fact it\u2019s a distraction or you\u2019re bringing it up is not something I want to be talking about.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots quarterback said he would never take a dig at his boss, adding that he has not spoken to Kraft about the cameo and blaming the media for misinterpreting the scene. \u201cI think it is again, I think it is this type of media atmosphere that you create,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blame, shame media atmosphere that has kind of percolated for a while. I think there are a lot of things that are said that are taken out of context that [the media] chooses to make a headline out of, as opposed to understanding what it is actually about.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was shot on a green screen,\u201d Brady continued. \u201cIt was agreed to a year ago. It was written four years ago. I think again, it\u2019s unfortunate that people would choose to think I would do something like that about Mr. Kraft. I think that is a very bad assessment of my relationship with him. I would never do that.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at ESPN", "description": "Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is denying that his cameo in Netflix's \"Living With Yourself\" is a dig at owner Robert Kraft.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180336780.jpg?fit=1024%2C706", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
