Religious doctrine scrambles to catch up to new food technology.", "language": "en", "text": "This month, Tyson announced it is investing in a company that will launch plant-based shrimp early next year, raising a curious question. Will it be kosher? The short answer is its ingredients \u2014 which mimic the verboten crustacean with a proprietary algae blend \u2014 could well be both kosher and halal. Once the product launches, the company will seek certification so that Jews who keep kosher and Muslims \u2014 certain Muslim groups avoid shellfish \u2014 can enjoy a shrimp cocktail, scampi, a po\u2019 boy or ceviche.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd yet. In this era of plenitude and choice and disruptive technology, what is permissible, what is forbidden and what is flouting the letter of religious law? The food system is in flux, the rise of plant-based meats and the promise of cell-cultured meats bending categories such that legislation, ideology and theology are scrambling to keep up.\n\nFrom lab to table: Will cell-cultured meat win over Americans?\n\nIf God says no pork, how does He feel about a very persuasive forgery? And if only beef from the forequarter is permitted, how will observant Jews parse meat grown in a lab, no bones and no quarters at all? How do you bleed an animal with no blood or slaughter an animal humanely if there\u2019s no slaughter? And if you give up meat for Lent, what constitutes a cheat?\n\nAbout 10 percent of the United States\u2019 5.5 million Jews consider themselves Orthodox \u2014 that number is higher for younger Jews, so the percentage is growing. They and other Jews who observe religious dietary laws eschew pork and shellfish and only eat meat that is ritually slaughtered. With a global population of 1.8 billion, the Muslim community has now reached 3.45 million in America, and is likely to become the second-largest religious group in the United States by 2040. Hinduism, with more than a billion adherents globally, is practiced by 1 percent of the U.S. population. These are large demographics to be courted, potentially the difference between solvency and failure in the ever more crowded alt-meat arena.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are already 100 plant-based meat products in the United States certified kosher, according to the Jewish Initiative for Animals, a project of Farm Forward, a farm animal advocacy nonprofit that works with all Jewish denominations.\n\nIn May 2018, Impossible Foods received its official kosher certification from the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the largest organization of Orthodox synagogues in the United States, responsible for certifying more than 400,000 industrial and consumer products. A rabbinic field representative had toured the 67,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Oakland, Calif., confirming that all ingredients, processes and equipment used to make the Impossible Burger were compliant with kosher law. And after a halal auditor visited the plant to determine ingredients and practices were halal-compliant and adherent to Islamic dietary laws, Impossible Foods received its halal certification from the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America in December.\n\nThe Impossible Burger is a wake-up call to the meat industry\n\nPackages, which debut in grocery stores on Sept. 19 (Impossible has been a restaurant product to date), will get an \u201cOU\u201d symbol that means the product is certified kosher. The designation signals it is made from inherently kosher or kosher-certified ingredients that are neither meat nor dairy. It will get a symbol with an M to indicate it is halal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRabbi Moshe Elefant, the chief operating officer of Orthodox Union Kosher, said, nonetheless, an observant Jew is not popping into Burger King to eat an Impossible Whopper anytime soon.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s for the sake of argument say everything they use is kosher; still their equipment isn\u2019t kosher. An observant Jew will never even walk in.\u201d\n\nNon-kosher restaurants for the strictly observant may still be a no-go but, Elefant argues, the vast majority of kosher foods are purchased in supermarkets that carry non-kosher items, packages of certified kosher Beyond Meat plant-based pork sausage shouldered right up against forbidden pork sausage made from animals.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIs it a violation of the spirit of the law? That becomes a realm that you can never end. The best example that I always give is there are companies that are certified to make pizza for Passover. There\u2019s not one issue about the kosher status of those products, but you may feel that it\u2019s inappropriate to eat pizza for Passover,\" Elefant said.\n\nAD\n\nHe adds that it\u2019s a constant challenge to interpret dietary law in light of modern technology, and that while \u201cthere clearly is a biblical statement that the purpose of the dietary laws is to separate us, it\u2019s not up to us to draw the line.\u201d\n\nRabbi Eli Lando is the chief customer relations officer with OK Kosher, one of the country\u2019s oldest and largest certifiers, which certified Beyond Meat (Beyond says it intends to apply for halal certification). Lando is more bullish about the growing array of plant-based meats, predicting products like these will make it easier to keep kosher and thus grow the ranks of the observant.\n\nAD\n\nAn \u2018Impossible\u2019 question: Is fake meat kosher? Reporter Laura Reiley tackles it on Post Reports.\n\n\u201cYou may speak with three different rabbis and get 25 different opinions, but we know according to Jewish law that you are not supposed to be prohibiting yourself from what is allowed according to God\u2019s commandments,\" he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe prohibitions, he said, are about the actual creatures (pigs, shellfish, rabbits and reptiles), not a plant-based facsimile, however uncanny the likeness. Strictly kosher Jews, he notes, are frequently big fans of fake crab made of finely pulverized white fish. Lando sees plant-based meat as a revolution of sorts.\n\n\u201cA person today knows that being kosher does not mean you have to go to the back of the store and look for something like a second-class citizen. Having those products commonly available is achieving a great milestone,\" he said.\n\nAD\n\nKosher certification is exhaustive and costly work \u2014 every ingredient must be inspected, the facility may have to be washed down at high temperature, and then there\u2019s a waiting period. Surprise inspectors are sent frequently. Lando estimates certification in North America costs between $4,000 and $8,000 per manufacturing facility.\n\nAD\n\nThe inspection and certification process is similar for halal foods. For plant-based products designed to imitate haram products (pork and other foods forbidden by Islamic law), Roger Othman, director of consumer relations for Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America, said words matter.\n\n\u201cPlant-based bacon bits, for example. The product would qualify to be halal but may be repugnant to halal consumers if the word bacon appeared in the name,\" Othman said. \"Halal consumers would not know what pork chews like, maybe not even what it smells or looks like. If plant-based, it could qualify to be halal, but the naming should not contain any pork-related words.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor Mat McDermott, director of communications at the Hindu American Foundation, the introduction of Impossible Burgers and other plant-based meat 2.0 may not be particularly problematic. Plant-based meat companies are proliferating in India. Still, there may be a \u201cyuck\u201d factor for the products that bleed like the real deal, and because cows are sacred animals for many Hindus, plant-based beef or cell-cultured beef prompts additional queasiness and questions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMimicking is fine; it poses no theological problems,\u201d he said. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it still may just be textured vegetable protein. That said, most Hindu vegetarians eschew meat for ethical reasons. McDermott believes we\u2019re at an inflection point at which consumers of all faiths are making choices that consider environmental problems with ethical implications.\n\n\u201cCultured meat presents thornier questions Hindus have never had to answer. If there\u2019s no perceptible harm, no animal killed in the process? That\u2019s the central knotted question of diet and animal welfare. Where do you draw the line?\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAaron Gross, an associate professor of Jewish studies at University of San Diego, also perceives a cultural shift in religious attitudes toward animal cruelty. For 15 years, there has been a tiny \u201canimals and religion\u201d panel at the annual American Academy of Religion conference, with maybe 10 or 15 attendees. In the past couple years, that has ballooned to several events with as many as 150 attendees each. He said that as animal agriculture became more industrialized and fewer Americans had direct connections to farm animals, there had been a shift away from addressing issues like animal suffering.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s returning to its historic place as something theologians grapple with,\u201d Gross said. He cites climate change, a growing interest in food\u2019s provenance and \u201cdeeper currents of how we make meaning in the world\u201d as reasons for the pivot.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s thinking about meat. He\u2019s concerned about meat enough that it is a major theme,\u201d said Gross, adding that there\u2019s an energetic dispute within Judaism about whether to raise these broad ethical questions about meat at all.\n\nVeggie burgers were living an idyllic little existence. Then they got caught in a war over the future of meat.\n\nCultured or cell-based meat, grown from a tissue sample of an animal in a lab, is poised to launch next year and may solve some of these ethical questions, said Bruce Friedrich, founder of the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that promotes plant-based meat. But it raises others.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a whole new way of making meat that has everything to do with food safety and humane treatment,\u201d he said. He said three of the first eight cultivated-meat companies are in Israel, although none is certified kosher because there is not yet an established certification framework.\n\nJewish and Muslim scholars are still evaluating what this new Wild West of meat might mean. Companies like Memphis Meat and JUST that aim to debut cultured products next year have a vested interest in having their products certified halal or kosher, but whether rabbis will certify it as \u201cmeat\u201d or \u201ckosher\u201d is up in the air.\n\nGross and Friedrich predict yes. Rabbi Lando suggests that the strictly kosher community will have more flexibility if it is certified kosher, but he\u2019s not sure.\n\n\u201cGreat minds are working on cell-based meat. Research is still being done on this topic,\u201d Lando said. \u201cWe prefer to measure twice and cut once.\u201d\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nUnderstanding your browser\u2019s privacy issues\n\nOur tech reviewer found more than 11,000 requests in a week for trackers from websites in Google Chrome.
