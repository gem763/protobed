The agreement consolidates Turkish gains since its invasion began on October 9.\n\nKurdish forces have not yet pulled back from Ras-al-Ayn, and their willingness to do so may put the ceasefire to the test, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cWe will do whatever we can for the success of the cease-fire agreement,\u201d commander of Kurdish forces Mazloum Abdi told Kurdish TV on Thursday.
