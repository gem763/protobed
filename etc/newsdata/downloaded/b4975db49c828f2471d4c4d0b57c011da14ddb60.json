That Doesn\u2019t Mean the EU Lost.", "language": "en", "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson came to Brussels\u2014the city of his childhood\u2014to strike a new divorce deal enacting Brexit, the central promise of his premiership. But Johnson was elected on a promise to do the impossible\u2014to get rid of the contentious Irish \u201cbackstop,\u201d to ensure that Britain was freer of Brussels. The fact is, through diplomatic sleight of hand and some genuine concessions, he succeeded\u2014or at least succeeded sufficiently to make a reasonable case that he did. Gone is the backstop, and in its place a permanent new settlement for Northern Ireland with options to leave the arrangement, something the EU had previously ruled out.\n\nRead: The legal clause that makes Brexiteers furious\u2014and why they have a point\n\nWithin minutes of the deal being struck, Johnson and his Conservative Party began Tweet-boasting their achievement. \u201cBoris has got a new deal,\u201d read a campaign-ready poster published by the Tory central office. The prime minister himself sent out another message: \u201cOur new deal will get Brexit done and take back control.\u201d Tory members of Parliament were quick to jump on board as well. Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s leadership rival, wrote: \u201cFair play Boris. Many doubted it was possible to do this \u2026 Bravo.\u201d\n\nDid Johnson actually outmaneuver the EU through force of personality, determination, and a willingness to contemplate what others, chiefly his predecessor Theresa May, would not: Britain\u2019s departure without a deal? And if so, what is one to make of that\u2014or, more important, what is the Continent supposed to make of that? Is the message Europe really wants to send that its opponents should be more Johnson and less May?\n\nJohnson, it is true, achieved more than May, despite\u2014or because of\u2014appearing more unreasonable. He came to power threatening to pull Britain out of the EU without a withdrawal deal and setting the bar for success at a level that seemed impossible to reach (and, in the end, proved to be). And yet he wrestled at least one major concession that had previously not been offered: that Northern Ireland could vote to leave the new arrangement agreed on by both sides, should a majority in its assembly vote to do so. It is a unilateral exit mechanism designed to answer Johnson\u2019s most bitter criticism of the original Irish proposal\u2014that it was anti-democratic. The EU gave ground under pressure, and this may be used as an example by leaders in the future who find themselves in dispute with Brussels.\n\nStill, the bloc did not let go of its key negotiating priority\u2014to ensure that no customs infrastructure was erected on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, a separate EU member state. It was a tactical retreat, but the strategy held.\n\nStand even farther back and while, yes, the EU is undoubtedly weakened by the act of Brexit itself, it cannot reasonably be said to have been structurally weakened by its handling of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit. Speaking with diplomats and officials here in Brussels as well as in London, Dublin, and Belfast, it\u2019s clear that the EU, in its protection of Ireland, has sent a clear message to all its member states, which, barring a handful at most, are global minnows, with histories of neighborly domination\u2014or even annexation: Within the EU, their power is amplified and their interests protected in a way they could not hope for on their own.", "description": "Two lessons emerged from the latest Brexit deal: The British prime minister garnered a concession his predecessor couldn\u2019t, but the EU has still held the line.", "authors": ["Tom Mctague"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2RKVU/facebook.jpg?1571345424", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
