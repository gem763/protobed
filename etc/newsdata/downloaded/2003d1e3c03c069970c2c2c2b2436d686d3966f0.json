Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont\u2014their first chance to face off. But the Democrats largely tried to keep the discussion positive, praising the Obama administration and reiterating that they had more in common with each other than with President Trump.\n\nHere were the moments that mattered most:\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u2019\n\nThe battle between passion and pragmatism played out early during an exchange over the nation\u2019s health-care system.\n\nMr. Biden immediately went on the attack against Ms. Warren and her support of a Medicare-for-All plan long promoted by Mr. Sanders. \u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie; well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d Mr. Biden said, tying himself to popular former President Obama. \u201cI think the Obamacare worked.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden called for adding a government-run insurance option to the Affordable Care Act to compete with private plans, suggesting the proposal backed by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders is unrealistic, unaffordable and would take private insurance away from tens of millions.\n\nAt the third Democratic debate, candidates argued over which health care plan would lower consumer costs the most.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. \u201cIt says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it,\u201d she said of the Sanders bill. \u201cThat means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. That\u2019s in four years. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren responded that her policies would be paid for by the wealthiest. \u201cCosts are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down.\u201d\n\n\u2018A huge debt to President Obama\u2019\n\nFollowing the last debate in July, allies of Mr. Obama expressed frustration over some candidates\u2019 criticism of the previous administration\u2019s immigration and trade policies. This time candidates were effusive about the former Democratic president even when pushing for more progressive approaches.\n\n\u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being,\u201d said Ms. Warren as she pushed for Medicare for All, which would replace private insurers with government-run health care.\n\nAnd former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014who had criticized Mr. Obama on immigration in the last debate\u2014invoked the former president in contrasting the Castro health-care proposal with Mr. Biden\u2019s more incremental plan. \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Castro said.\n\n\u2018A house divided cannot stand\u2019\n\nMany Democrats grumbled that the first two primary debates had candidates battling each other rather than contrasting themselves with President Trump. On Thursday, several candidates called for keeping the fight clean and staying unified against the current White House occupant.\n\nThe 10 candidates lined up for their introductions.

Kamala Harris of California. \u201cWhen you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47\u2019\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who overhauled his campaign strategy following an August mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso to focus more on gun control, got a standing ovation from some in the audience when he called for a mandatory gun-buyback program.\n\nAlthough most of the candidates agree on other gun-control measures, Mr. O\u2019Rourke is one of the few to advocate such a plan, which conservatives call a violation of the Second Amendment. Ms. Klobuchar was one of the candidates who said she would support only a voluntary version.\n\nCandidates proposed gun buyback programs and stricter background checks, in the wake of recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. They detailed their plans at the third Democratic debate in Houston.

On Thursday, he said he shouldn\u2019t have voted that way.\n\n\u201cWith regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is, you know, I should have never voted to give [former President George W.] Bush the authority to go in and do what we said he was going to do,\u201d Mr. Biden said.\n\nThe former vice president said that after troops were deployed, he argued against the way the war was conducted\u2014\u201cthat in fact we were doing it the wrong way, there was no plan, we should not be engaged, we didn\u2019t have the people with us, we didn\u2019t have our alliance, we didn\u2019t have our allies with us.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders wasn\u2019t satisfied, pointing out that he himself voted against authorizing the invasion.\n\nWrite to Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com and John McCormick at mccormick.john@wsj.com", "description": "The top candidates clashed over health policy, and former Vice President Biden said he was wrong to vote in favor of the 2003 Iraq invasion.", "authors": ["Tarini Parti", "John Mccormick", "Tarini.Parti Wsj.Com", "Mccormick.John Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106895/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
