Democrats say the request and other actions by the administration to push Ukraine to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden and his family amounted to a quid pro quo for important military aid for Ukraine, providing sufficient grounds for impeachment.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the resolution Thursday, amid complaints from Trump and his Republicans allies that the month-long impeachment process is illegitimate and unfair.\n\nMinority whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, denounced what he called a \"Soviet-style impeachment process\" led by House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff of California.\n\nHouse minority whip Steve Scalise denounced what he called a 'Soviet-style impeachment process.' (Patrick Semansky/The Associated Press)\n\nMore than 75 per cent of House members have been unable to view what is happening in closed-door depositions conducted by the intelligence panel and two other committees, Scalise said.\n\n\"That represents more than 230 million Americans whose voices are denied right now,\" he said.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, said Democrats \"have basically cooked up a process they have been conducting in secret\" with the goal of preventing Trump's lawyers from asking questions of witnesses.\n\nDemocrats \"are now attempting to sort of put a cloak of legitimacy around this process by saying they're going to bring it to a vote on the floor,\" Cheney said. \"They can't fix it. The process is broken. It's tainted.\"\n\nDemocrats insist they aren't yielding to Republican pressure and dismissed a Republican argument that impeachment can't begin without a formal House vote.\n\nSchiff and other Democrats defended the process and said the American people will soon hear from witnesses in an open setting, with transcripts of depositions already conducted set for public release.\n\n\"The evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\" Schiff and three other committee chairs said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries, the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings, \"where the American people will learn firsthand about the president's misconduct,\" the Democrats said.", "description": "House Democrats have introduced a resolution that authorizes the next phase of the impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340032.1572379513!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trump-impeachment.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
