REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\nThe EU started normalizing relations with one-party Cuba about the same time as the United States five years ago, ending decades of Cold War-era hostility.\n\nBut EU and U.S. policies have diverged, as U.S. President Donald Trump has unraveled the detente pursued by his predecessor. He has reverted to seeking to coerce the government to reform, a strategy that many experts say has long failed.\n\n\u201cThe EU is Cuba\u2019s top commercial partner and investor, and we have tripled cooperation in the last two years,\u201d Mogherini, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, told a news conference with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez.\n\nEU development aid is welcome in an ailing economy - one of the world\u2019s last Soviet-style command economies - struggling with tighter U.S. sanctions and lower aid from leftist ally Venezuela in the wake of its own economic and political crisis.\n\nLast week, the United States issued new regulations limiting the remittances its citizens can send to Cuba.\n\nEurope could help Cuba update its economy, said Mogherini, who also met Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Monday. Investment would also help European companies consolidate their foothold on the island as it opens up.\n\nThe official said the two countries already held bilateral talks on topics such as sustainable development and human rights within the framework of a political dialogue and cooperation pact agreed in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe have also continued the dialogue on the situation in the region and cooperation, on Venezuela in particular,\u201d she said.\n\nCuba is a strong ally of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, whom most Western nations want to step down in favour of opposition leader Juan Guaido, arguing his election was fraudulent and there must be a new vote.\n\nSeveral opposition groups have called for the EU to suspend its cooperation agreement with Cuba, due to what the groups call an increase in repression on the one-party island.\n\nThey accuse authorities of raiding dozens of activists\u2019 homes in recent weeks and detaining more than 100 people last weekend alone.\n\nCuban authorities dismiss dissidents, who have limited support on the island, as a tiny minority of provocateurs financed by the United States to subvert the government.\n\nEU officials say they believe they can better influence Cuba on human rights through dialogue than coercion.", "description": "The European Union is committed to helping Cuba develop its economy, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Monday, during a three-day trip to Havana, even as the United States hikes sanctions on the Communist-run island.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428083611&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881SX", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
