Despite those headwinds, she went on to become a decorated journalist, winning three Emmys.\n\nIn 2017, Roberts said she felt privileged to have had a career in the \u201cfront seat to history.\u201d\n\nThe statement from Obama was a stark contrast from the current president\u2019s response to Roberts\u2019 death. President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that he \u201cnever met her,\u201d and once again made a person\u2019s death about himself.\n\nTrump on Cokie Roberts: \u201cShe never treated me nicely. But I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional and I respect professionals. I respect you guys a lot, you people a lot. She was a real professional. Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her.\" \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cShe never treated me nicely, but I would like to wish her family well. She was a professional and I respect professionals. ... Never treated me well, but I certainly respect her,\u201d Trump said, according to a pool report.\n\nRoberts riled up then-candidate Trump in a 2016 interview when she asked him about white children using his name to bully and intimidate Hispanic children.
