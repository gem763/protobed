A broader invasion could reach the prisons, and it would set off an armed conflict that could prompt the Kurds to pull guards from prisons so they could instead join the fight.\n\nThe \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d is that the Kurds are so frustrated and angered by the United States\u2019 action that \u201cthey decide to release wholesale some of the detainees,\u201d said Christopher P. Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism on Mr. Trump\u2019s National Security Council who now heads the International Spy Museum.\n\nIs Turkey planning to take custody of ISIS prisoners?\n\nIt was not clear. The White House said Turkey would \u201cnow be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d But Turkey has given no public sign that it has agreed to take over that headache.\n\nFor now at least, the Kurds have told American officials that they will continue to hold the ISIS detainees. But a senior State Department official acknowledged that the best-trained guards could be pulled away in the event of a conflict with Turkey, calling it a \u201cbig concern\u201d that some ISIS fighters could go free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Turkey has the capacity to handle securely and appropriately the detainees long held by the Syrian Kurds \u2014 and that\u2019s if Turkey even genuinely intends to try,\u201d said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\n\nWhy did Trump complain about Europeans?\n\nThe Kurds have implored countries around the world to take back their citizens who fought for the Islamic State and were captured. But that idea is politically unpopular in many European countries. Mr. Trump is correct that nations like Belgium, Britain, France and Germany have been largely content to let the Kurds bear the burden of detaining their citizens \u2014 particularly the male fighters.\n\nMany European law enforcement officials fear that if they repatriate their extremist citizens, they would be unable to convict them or keep them locked up for a long time. European counterterrorism laws are weaker than those in the United States, where a conviction merely for joining a designated terrorist group can yield a 15-year prison sentence.", "description": "Thousands of Islamic State prisoners of war from around the world are being detained by the Syrian Kurd forces whom Turkey plans to target.", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/us/07dc-detainees/merlin_151067130_e3596fba-c47b-4ad2-a3ba-240d876c34ba-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
