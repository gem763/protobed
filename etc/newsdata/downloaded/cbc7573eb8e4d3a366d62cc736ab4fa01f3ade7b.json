(AP) \u2014 Nick Bosa sacked Case Keenum to run out the clock, belly flopped onto the field and rode it like a Slip \u2018N Slide.\n\n\u201cSlid way farther than I thought was going to slide,\u201d he said.\n\nBosa and the San Francisco 49ers Slip \u2018N Slided their way to an ugly 9-0 win at the Washington Redskins in steady rain and driving wind Sunday to remain undefeated. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but San Francisco is 6-0 for the third time in franchise history, and first since 1990.\n\n\u201cIt takes you back to being a kid: You\u2019re out there, you\u2019re sloshing around and your shoes are full of water and mud,\u201d cornerback Richard Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a kid\u2019s game at the end of the day. Guys had a lot of fun slipping and sliding out there, but winning\u2019s always fun.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan thought about flopping onto his old home field with his players, but watched them gleefully instead after beating the team that fired him and his father, Mike, in 2013. Shanahan knew from his time as Washington\u2019s offensive coordinator how bad the FedEx Field surface can be in normal weather and adjusted along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just throwing and catching, but it\u2019s tough to stand up and block people, too,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cEveryone knows how the field always is and just the way it was raining from last night made it a tough game for both sides.\u201d\n\nShanahan\u2019s bunch didn\u2019t look like an unbeaten powerhouse in horrific conditions that made life difficult on quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and the entire offense. Garoppolo bounced back from a dreadful first half to finish a passable 12 of 21 for 151 yards passing.\n\nRobbie Gould made field goals from 28, 22 and 29 yards to provide the only offense of the game.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s defense continued its dominant run after holding the Los Angeles Rams to seven points last week and the Cleveland Browns to three before that. The Niners are the first team since 2005 and sixth since 1990 to limit an opponent to seven or fewer points and fewer than 200 net yards of offense in three consecutive games.\n\nAfter the team\u2019s first shutout since Week 1 of the 2016 season \u2014 forcing Adrian Peterson to fumble in the third quarter \u2014 defensive lineman DeForest Buckner was upset the defense only got one turnover.\n\n\u201cGuys are just owning their jobs, not pointing any fingers when things go wrong,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s seeing what we can do better to help the D and we\u2019re just feeding off each other\u2019s energy.\u201d\n\nThe weather seemed a perfect fit for interim Redskins coach Bill Callahan\u2019s run-first, run-second and run-third mentality. Washington (1-6) started the game with 10 rushing plays and Peterson ran for 81 yards on 20 carries, but they were shut out for the first time this season.\n\n\u201cIt was tough sledding,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWe knew coming in that, especially with the rain, it was going to be that type of game, the field was muddy. I felt like we started off well, had an opportunity to put points on the board. We weren\u2019t successful with that.\u201d\n\nRedskins lineman Ereck Flowers wasn\u2019t sure why 49ers players did mud angels and slid all over the field in celebration, but put it on Washington for letting it happen.\n\n\u201cWinning is the cure for everything,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cIf we won the game, there wouldn\u2019t be no sliding.\u201d\n\nHOME-FIELD DISADVANTAGE\n\nAmong those who braved the rain, more than half were 49ers fans \u2014 a trend that has haunted the Redskins this season. A \u201cLet\u2019s go Niners!\u201d chant broke out in the fourth quarter among those in Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Joe Montana and other jerseys from the organization\u2019s storied past.\n\nLinebacker Kwon Alexander, who forced Peterson\u2019s fumble, said, \u201cIt definitely felt like a home game.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins had alumni in town for their annual \u201cHomecoming Weekend,\u201d but lost their eighth in a row at FedEx Field.\n\nPOINTLESS HALF\n\nBoth offenses struggled mightily in a sloppy first half.\n\nWashington took the opening drive and chewed up more than eight minutes on nine rushes and just one pass, but came up empty when Dustin Hopkins missed wide right from 39 yards. Peterson gained 57 yards on the ground for Washington but just 8 after the first drive.\n\nGould missed from 45 yards in the second quarter. For the half, the 49ers totaled 68 yards as Garoppolo finished 3 of 10 with 10 yards passing and were shut out in the game\u2019s first 30 minutes for the first time this year.\n\nIt was the first 0-0 first half in the NFL since Week 17 in 2017 between the Cowboys and Eagles.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\nSherman: \u201cMud Bowl 2019 champions!\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\n49ers: RB Matt Breida cleared concussion protocol and returned after being evaluated for an eye injury. \u2026 WR Marquise Goodwin was evaluated for a concussion in the first half but was held out. \u2026 Starting offensive tackles Joe Staley (leg) and Mike McGlinchey (knee) remained out.\n\nRedskins: S Montae Nicholson was lost to a right ankle injury in the second quarter. Nicholson was carted off the sideline. \u2026 Played without injured CB Josh Norman (hand/thigh), RB Chris Thompson (toe) and TE Vernon Davis (concussion).\n\nUP NEXT\n\n49ers: Look for the second 7-0 start in franchise history when they host the Carolina Panthers next Sunday.\n\nRedskins: Visit former starting quarterback Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "LANDOVER, Md.
