It\u2019s nearly as popular in the UK, historically speaking, as blame the French. And Leo Varadkar might be happy that Boris Johnson isn\u2019t blaming Ireland for the no-deal Brexit everyone knows is coming.\n\nBut even as much as everyone likes to blame the Germans, this looks like a stretch:\n\nAn anonymous official in Boris Johnson\u2019s office told broadcast reporters on Tuesday that negotiations with European leaders over Brexit were \u201cessentially impossible\u201d after the British prime minister concluded a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u2026 An anonymous source in Johnson\u2019s office briefed British broadcasters about a morning call between Johnson and Merkel, asserting that the Europeans would not budge an inch. \u201cIt was a very useful and clarifying moment in all sorts of ways,\u201d the British official was quoted as saying. \u201cIf this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible, not just now but ever.\u201d\n\nNarrator: It doesn\u2019t represent a new established position. In fact, what Merkel appeared to say today was what the EU has said for the past three years, but 10 Downing is spinning it as something new:\n\n\u201cMerkel said that if Germany wanted to leave the E.U., they could do it, no problem. But the U.K. cannot leave without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever,\u201d the British source was quoted as saying.\n\nThis has been the backstop position all along. The EU is willing to negotiate a Brexit but only if the UK can solve the problem it has created with Brexit. The backstop \u2014 having Northern Ireland in the customs and regulatory union or all of the UK \u2014 would last as long as it takes the UK to solve the problem that backstop temporarily resolves.\n\nThis is the problem: The UK committed to a frictionless border in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which was easy to establish when both the UK and the Republic of Ireland were both in the EU. Brexit from the EU on the UK\u2019s terms would require border checks to enforce the two different customs and regulatory regimes that would exist by the UK\u2019s design on the island. Those don\u2019t just apply to trade, but also to immigration, over which the UK also wants to regain its sovereignty through Brexit. It is therefore incumbent on the UK to come up with a solution that allows them to comply with the Good Friday Agreement, a point which Johnson himself has acknowledged.\n\nEssentially, Merkel told Johnson that his latest proposal \u2014 which envisions border checks, even if located elsewhere than the physical border \u2014 doesn\u2019t solve the problem. That would require the backstop to remain in place until the UK comes up with a plan that actually does resolve the conflict between the GFA and Brexit. If that means the backstop would remain in place \u201cforever,\u201d as this leak claims, it only points up the painfully obvious-by-now fact that Johnson really has no idea at all how to solve the problem.\n\nThat\u2019s not Angela Merkel\u2019s fault. It\u2019s a flaw in the original design of Brexit, one which the Tories have tried to ignore or downplay ever since.\n\nIn response, the EU told Johnson to grow up:\n\nThe European Union accused Britain of playing a \u201cstupid blame game\u201d over Brexit on Tuesday after a Downing Street source said a deal was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands. \u2026 \u201cBoris Johnson, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,\u201d European Council President Tusk said on Twitter. \u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d Such abrupt remarks indicate the Brexit blame game has begun in earnest, and that now both London and European capitals are preparing for an acrimonious and potentially chaotic Brexit for which neither side wants to be held responsible.\n\nThis does smell like end-game spin, but especially in the UK. Johnson may have hoped that the EU was desperate enough to avoid the damage from a no-deal Brexit that they\u2019d glumly accept his ultimatum. The EU, however, has committed to Ireland that they will protect the GFA and the open border on the island. Plus, it\u2019s in their interest to make sure that the checks necessary once the UK goes its own way on trade deals are firmly in place rather than scattered in warehouses throughout not just the Six Counties but also throughout Ireland too \u2014 and Varadkar doesn\u2019t want to get stuck holding the bag for being the UK\u2019s customs enforcer.\n\nThe no-deal Brexit is upon us now. The only thing left to see is who gets the blame for the damage that will follow, and whether Northern Ireland decides to enforce another clause of the GFA by holding a referendum on reunification \u2014 which would solve the whole problem by pushing the border into the Irish Sea.", "description": "\u201cBoris Johnson, what\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/boris-johnson.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
