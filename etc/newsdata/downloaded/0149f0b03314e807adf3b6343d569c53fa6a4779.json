They also damaged window frames by kicking them.\n\n\"It looks like they have caused around \u00a320,000 worth of damage if not more.\"\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nMr McKibben explained that this is not the first time the site has been attacked.\n\nHe added: \"We have had damage caused almost every week since we started building a few months ago but nothing like this.\n\n\"It is going to take a lot of time and cost a lot of money to repair the damage here.\"\n\nAlthough it has not been confirmed by the emergency services, a number of other social media posts stated that large groups of children have been seen on the street this evening.\n\nOn Facebook , one woman said: \"King Street is blocked off. Kids have robbed bins, laid them out across the road and set them on fire.\"\n\nAnother added: \"There\u2019s a gang of about 20/25 walking around.\"\n\nGarston is just one of the areas of Merseyside plighted with vandalism on Wednesday.\n\nDozens of people have reported windows being smashed, cars being damaged and wheelie bin fires being started in the streets close to King Street.\n\nA Merseyside Police spokeswoman told Mirror Online: \"Officers were called to King Street, Garston just after 7pm this evening (30th October) to reports that youths were causing damage and attempting to set fire to a bonfire at the above location.\n\n\n\n\"On police arrival, the youths also started to throw objects at them but thankfully there were no reported injuries.\n\n\"Anyone that witnessed the incident or knows those responsible should contact @MerPolCC on social media, call 101 or contact @CrimestoppersUK anonymously.\"", "description": "The construction site in Garston, Liverpool was\u00a0set on fire and had windows smashed in by a gang of kids, according to reports", "authors": ["Jenny Kirkham", "Image", "Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761779.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mischief-Night-rampage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
