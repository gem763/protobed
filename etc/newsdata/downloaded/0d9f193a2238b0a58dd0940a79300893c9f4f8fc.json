REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nThe lawmakers on Thursday emphatically rejected Sylvie Goulard, Macron\u2019s pick to head industrial policy in the next European Commission over her role in a jobs scandal, in which she denies wrongdoing, and her past work as an adviser for a U.S. think-tank which paid her more than 10,000 euros a month.\n\nTheir move could potentially delay the start of the new Commission, which is due to take office on Nov. 1, and curb the influence of France, the European Union\u2019s second biggest economy and a founding member of the club.\n\nEach EU member state nominates a candidate for the Commission who must then pass a confirmation hearing in the European Parliament.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow a European political crisis to escalate,\u201d Macron told reporters before a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the Elysee palace in Paris.\n\nHe said a Europe consumed by \u201cits own petty wars\u201d would become a weaker power on the global stage.\n\nPrivately, French officials are seething and accused Manfred Weber, a German conservative member of the European Parliament, of orchestrating Goulard\u2019s downfall as revenge after Macron scuppered his hopes of becoming the next Commission president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s vengeance and resentment, and we feel we\u2019re paying the price of tactics by the (conservative) European People\u2019s Party, which are alien to us because we\u2019re newcomers,\u201d a source within Macron\u2019s party told Reuters.\n\n\u201cANTI-FRENCH\u201d\n\nWeber\u2019s entourage denied they acted out of revenge.\n\n\u201cThe EPP group always insisted on the seriousness of the procedure because the European Parliament has an important democratic role to play with these confirmation hearings,\u201d an EPP official said.\n\nAnother source close to Macron said \u201canti-French\u201d sentiment among countries in Germany\u2019s orbit also played a role in Goulard\u2019s rejection, reflecting a sense that Macron had acquired too much influence in the incoming executive.\n\nIt was Macron who successfully proposed Ursula von der Leyen, another leading German conservative, to become the next Commission president, and Goulard received a huge portfolio overseeing the EU internal market and European defence integration.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on France,\u201d the first source close to Macron said. \u201cThere\u2019s an anti-French front, that\u2019s very clear. They\u2019re trying to make us pay because France is now the engine of Europe and some prefer the status quo.\u201d\n\nThe second source close to Macron added: \u201cTaking down the candidate of France can\u2019t be without consequences.\u201d The source declined to elaborate.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nMacron will call von der Leyen over the weekend to seek \u201cassurances\u201d that, beyond Goulard\u2019s case, the incoming Commission\u2019s agenda won\u2019t be paralysed by turbulent EU lawmakers, a French diplomatic source said.\n\nThe president will also raise the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in talks at the Elysee on Sunday, the diplomatic source added.\n\n\u201cIt poses a problem for the future. If when we start talking about policies we face these sorts of divisions, it will weaken everybody: the Commission\u2019s president, the Commission and the European project,\u201d the source said.", "description": "French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Friday of a \"political crisis\" between the EU's executive and its parliament after lawmakers rejected his pick for commissioner, while members of his party blamed a leading German conservative for the debacle.", "authors": ["Michel Rose", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439770860&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1A6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
