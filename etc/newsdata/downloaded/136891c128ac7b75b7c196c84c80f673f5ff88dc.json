They come in a charging case as well.\n\nThe buds have some more Microsoft-specific features, too, in the form of an integration with the Office 365 suite. Microsoft says that Surface Earbuds are designed to let you dictate text into apps like Microsoft Word or Microsoft Teams, and that they'll even let you change slides on PowerPoint by swiping on them.\n\nThis isn't Microsoft's first foray into premium audio. Last year, Microsoft introduced the noise-cancelling Surface Headphones, priced at $350.\n\nThis time out, Microsoft will be going head-to-head with Apple's ubiquitous AirPods. But where the AirPods are priced at $160, Microsoft's asking price of $249 may turn would-be buyers off. Similarly, the recently announced $130 Amazon Echo Buds may present a more affordable alternative, especially since they're powered by Bose's vaunted noise-cancellation technology.\n\nThere are also matters of design to consider. In order to achieve the 24-hour battery life, it seems, Microsoft had to make the Surface Earbuds rather large compared with its competitors. And, of course, we haven't actually heard how the Surface Earbuds sound just yet, which may be the most important factor of all.\n\nStill, the original Surface Headphones won positive reviews, despite the pricetag. If Microsoft can repeat the trick with the Surface Earbuds, it might have the makings of a successful push into the premium audio market \u2014 especially with the appeal to Windows super-fans and Office power users.", "description": "The Surface Earbuds are a new, premium product from Microsoft that compete with the likes of Apple's AirPods.", "authors": ["Matt Weinberger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94bb6c71cffc089c020357?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
