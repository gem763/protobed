Not going to happen.\u201d\n\nAt the outset of September, a new round of tariffs went into effect on goods from both countries. The U.S. implemented tariffs worth 15 percent on a host of goods from China, a decision that was met with countermeasures.\n\nChina subsequently filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO), asking the organization to facilitate \u201cconsultations\u201d with the U.S. to reduce or end tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, the president said tariffs are \u201ca beautiful thing\u201d when implemented properly. He also reiterated the fact that China is \u201ceating the cost\u201d of the levies.\n\nAs previously reported by FOX Business, manufacturing companies are leaving China and heading to Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand in order to lessen the financial burden of the tariffs.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. and China last week agreed to hold another round of talks in Washington D.C. next month. The two sides will hold consultations in mid-September to prepare.\n\nIt will be the thirteenth round of high-level economic talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The president said a deal would not happen unless it is beneficial for the U.S.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Trump-Rally-Thumb.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
