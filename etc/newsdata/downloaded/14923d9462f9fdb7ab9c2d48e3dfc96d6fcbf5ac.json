judgment finds Myer misled over profit forecast", "language": "en", "text": "Shareholders have won the first class action lawsuit to go all the way to judgment in Australia \u2013 but are unlikely to see a cent from defendant Myer because the stock market didn\u2019t believe inflated profit forecasts made by the retailer\u2019s chief executive, a judge has found.\n\nThe landmark judgment, handed down on Thursday by the federal court, is likely to be of more help to shareholders in future lawsuits, because judge Jonathan Beach accepted that it was not necessary to prove Myer misled every investor individually.\n\nInstead, drawing on a journal article he wrote while a barrister, Beach found that it was enough to show the market at large was misled.\n\nRelated: 'A horrible weight on my shoulders': the fury fuelling the robodebt class action\n\nShareholders in the case, which was organised by the Melbourne solicitor Mark Elliott, alleged Myer misled the market in September 2014 when its then CEO, Bernie Brookes, told analysts and journalists the company\u2019s profit would be higher in the 2015 financial year than the $98.5m posted in 2014.\n\nBut in March the following year the company admitted profits for the 2015 financial year would probably be down on the previous year, at between $75m and $80m, because of stagnant sales and soaring costs.\n\nMyer\u2019s share price immediately fell more than 10%.\n\nBeach found Myer engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by failing to correct Brookes\u2019s statement on multiple occasions between September 2014 and March 2015.\n\nBut the judge said he was \u201cnot convinced that the applicant and group members have suffered any loss flowing from such contraventions\u201d because Myer\u2019s share price \u201calready factored in an NPAT [net profit after tax] well south of Mr Brookes\u2019s rosy picture painted on 11 September 2014\u201d.\n\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n\n\u201cIn other words, the hard-edged scepticism of market analysts and market makers at the time of the contraventions had already deflated Mr Brookes\u2019s inflated views,\u201d Beach said.\n\n\u201cSo any required corrective statement that should have been made at the time of the contraventions, if it had been made, is likely to have had no or no material effect on the market price.\u201d\n\nHowever, Elliott told Guardian Australia he would now ask for access to the Myer share register so that he could write to shareholders \u201cand invite them to individually prove their loss\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the upshot of the decision and it\u2019s a slog but very doable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have registered 1,200 [shareholders] already and expect double that easily.\u201d\n\nIn a victory for class action lawyers and potential plaintiffs, Beach said he accepted the theory of \u201cmarket-based\u201d or indirect causation, where harm is done to investors because the price of securities they buy is inflated by incorrect information.\n\nThis is significantly easier to prove than showing that an investor directly relied on the misleading statements made by the company when deciding to buy shares.\n\nThe rosy picture painted by Brookes evaporated within weeks, evidence before the court shows.\n\nRelated: Rugby league players consider class action over NRL's treatment of concussions\n\nBy 30 October 2014, internal Myer forecasts predicted profit would be at most $95m, and could be as little as $84m.\n\nAnd a few days later, on 2 November 2014, Brookes sent an email to the board titled \u201cThe Good, The Bad and the Ugly\u201d in which he said that despite good recent sales figures, the overall picture was \u201c\u2018ugly\u2019 and even with $6m of cost reduction we will need the \u2018sales start\u2019 to the quarter to continue\u201d.\n\nBy this time Myer\u2019s internal profit forecasts were 5% more than those of analysts, Beach said.\n\n\u201cBut instead of announcing anything to the market, despite all of the negative news in the first quarter of FY15 and its internal profit projections showing the unlikelihood of FY15 NPAT above $90m, Myer appears to have thereafter created a series of internal profit projections which \u2018targeted\u2019 profit figures at the same level as the budget had originally proposed in July 2014,\u201d he said.\n\nMyer\u2019s share price has continued to fall since 2015 amid continuing consumer gloom.\n\nShares that changed hands for about $1.70 in mid-2015 closed at 10c on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs this matter relates to historical events and may be appealed, Myer will not provide any further comment on the judgment,\u201d the company said in a statement to the ASX.\n\n",
