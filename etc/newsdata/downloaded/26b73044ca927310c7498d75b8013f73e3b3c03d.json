We certainly recognize that pharmaceutical companies don't want to lose any profits,\" she told CBC News Network's Power & Politics.\n\n\"Canada is among ... the top three countries that pays the highest price for medication in the world and we certainly want to make sure that we lower the cost of prescription medication,\" she told host Vassy Kapelos.", "description": "A Canadian pharmaceutical lobby group and 16 of its members have filed a lawsuit against Ottawa's overhaul to how it regulates the costs of patented medicines.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273698.1567794325!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/petitpas-taylor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
