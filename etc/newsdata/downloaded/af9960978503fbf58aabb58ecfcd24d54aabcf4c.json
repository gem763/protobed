During the 30 minute conversation, Trump repeatedly offered to enlist the attorney general and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on a new mission: to help revive a dormant investigation of a Ukrainian energy firm as a way to damage Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, a former company board member.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr More\n\nWhile the Justice Department maintains that Barr knew nothing about Trump\u2019s entreaties until weeks later and has never communicated with Ukrainian officials, the episode detailed in the newly declassified memorandum of Trump\u2019s exchange with Zelensky has thrust the unwitting attorney general into a new, fast-moving political firestorm that poses a fresh threat to Trump\u2019s presidency and now to Barr\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nTrump's insertion of his attorney general into the widening controversy, analysts said, is likely to invite new challenges to Barr's independence from the White House even if he knew nothing of the president's efforts to enlist him in an effort to smear a rival.\n\nZelensky reacts: Ukraine's president on his call with Trump: 'Nobody pushed me'\n\nNow what: Nancy Pelosi launches Trump impeachment inquiry over Ukraine scandal\n\nBarr never talked to Ukraine officials\n\nDespite at least four references to Barr in Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Wednesday that the attorney general only learned of the president\u2019s July 25 conversation \u201cseveral weeks\u201d after it took place and that Barr has not communicated with Ukrainian officials.\n\nAttorney General William Barr. More\n\n\"The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son,\" Kupec said. \"The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine \u2013 on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine \u2013 on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine with Rudy Giuliani.\"\n\nYet Democratic lawmakers, who already have announced their intention to pursue an impeachment inquiry against the president based on the Ukrainian contact, were pouncing on Barr Wednesday.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a presidential hopeful and member of the Judiciary Committee, vowed to bring the attorney general before the panel to explain any attempts by Trump to target political rivals.\n\nOn May 1, when Barr was testifying about the Mueller report before the Judiciary Committee, he was asked if he had ever been ordered to open an investigation at the president's request. Harris says he did not fully answer the question.", "description": "President Trump inserts Attorney General William Barr and the Justice Department into a political firestorm in his call with the Ukrainian president", "authors": ["Kevin Johnson", "Kristine Phillips", "Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0eSsgRExyaOrfGnFF.u7cQ--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/156581f95efb3b277b4109fa5d093194", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
