Everybody should remain patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to resuming diplomatic relations with Kiribati and opening a new page in the two countries\u2019 relations,\u201d Geng said.\n\nHe said China also believed this would serve both countries\u2019 people and would be beneficial for peace, stability and prosperity for Pacific island countries.\n\nChina has welcome Kiribati\u2019s decision though the two have not yet officially signed an agreement to resume ties.\n\nLast week was a difficult one for Taiwan, as the Solomon Islands also ditched Taipei for Beijing. The Solomon Islands foreign minister signed a deal on diplomatic ties with Beijing in China on Saturday.\n\nBoth the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are small developing nations but lie in strategic waters that have been dominated by the United States and its allies since World War Two, and China\u2019s moves to expand its influence in the Pacific have angered Washington.\n\nA former Taiwanese ambassador to Kiribati, Abraham Chu, told Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency over the weekend that China had never fully removed the tracking station in Kiribati and said China\u2019s then-ambassador in Kiribati was a space expert.\n\nThe equipment was locked away and guarded by four fishermen, Chu said.\n\n\u201cIt seems it can come back at any time,\u201d he added, referring to the tracking station.\n\nThe Kiribati government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina\u2019s space program is overseen by the military. China\u2019s Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTaiwan now has formal relations with just 15 countries, mostly small and poor nations in Latin America and the Pacific, including Nauru, Tuvalu and Palau. China has signaled it is coming for the rest of its allies.", "description": "China will formally resume ties soon with Kiribati, the foreign ministry said on Monday, following the Pacific island state's decision to ditch relations with Taiwan.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432896688&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0L0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
