He\u2019s very good at talking, he\u2019s very smooth and calming, he would talk his way out of any situation.\"\n\n(Image: Social Media)\n\nThe pair were also rocked by claims Tommy partied at the same Boohoo event as Millie while Molly Mae worked in LA, and Tommy has been spotted several times being surrounded by adoring women at events without Molly Mae present.\n\nViewers also branded their relationship \"fake\", convinced that Molly was only on Love Island for the money, even nicknaming her \"Money Mae\".\n\nWhen she professed her love for Tommy on the show, her authenticity was called into question as viewers blasted her tears as fake too.\n\nOne tweeted: \"In all the 8 weeks of #LoveIsland I have not seen actual tears fall from Molly-Mae\u2019s eyes once when she has been \u2018crying\u2019\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnother added: \"I produce more tears from a cat allergy then Molly does when she\u2019s \u201ccrying\u201d. What is this sorcery?!\"\n\nA third said: \"Molly fake crying before Tommy even gave his speech.\"\n\nBut the pair seem to be moving past all that, and they recently jetted around the US on their first holiday together, where Tommy introduced his girlfriend to his older brother, boxer Tyson.\n\nThe couple also bought a luxurious penthouse apartment together in Manchester which they live in.\n\nTommy told The Sun: 'We're both really happy.\"\n\nIndia Reynolds and Ovie Soko\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIndia and Ovie's promising romance was rocked to its core when a cheating scandal hit headlines in recent weeks and fans believe the couple to be on the verge of a split.\n\nTrolls cruelly accused the curvy model of cheating on her love after she was spotted attending her footballer ex Kieran Gibbs' 30th birthday party.\n\nThe vegan chef admitted she even faced death threats from trolls over the false accusations.\n\nIndia bemoaned the couple had a \"week of nightmares\" amid the bitter scandal.\n\nShe told The Daily Mail : \"We\u2019ve had a week of nightmare things. There was one [rumour] last week and then yesterday there was another. Can we have a break? Can we just live, please?\n\n(Image: Colin Hawkins photography/Lovehoney)\n\n\"We\u2019ve been absolutely fine, but obviously it\u2019s not nice. The worst thing is \u2013 something coming out in the paper is one thing, we know it\u2019s not true and we can just get over that \u2013 but it\u2019s all the people on Instagram that start sending you horrible messages.\"\n\nShe elaborated: \"I\u2019ve known Kieran and his brother for years and it was their 30th birthday so I was there with loads of friends and family. There\u2019s nothing about it! It got blown into a ridiculous thing.\"\n\nMore recently, fans expressed their thoughts the couple were on a verge of a split because they hadn't been seen together in some time.\n\n\"Are you still with Ovie?\" One fan wrote, leading the troops.\n\nBut sources close to India told The Mirror: \"There is no truth in this whatsoever and India & Ovie are very much still together.\"\n\nIndia was a late arrival into the villa but she managed to win over the heart of the sports star.\n\nThe Mirror has approached India Reynolds and Ovie Soko's representatives for further comment.\n\nDanny Williams and Jourdan Raine\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDanny Williams and Jourdan Riane's time in the villa was short lived, and they were dumped when they failed to win the support of the public.\n\nTheir relationship has had more lasting power, and not only are they still together, they also recently moved into together.\n\nBut Jourdan sparked rumours Danny had been unfaithful with a cryptic Instagram caption.\n\nAlongside a sultry selfie, she wrote: \"I only trust boys on days that don't end in Y...\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nFans were quick to assume the worst, and jumped to send her messages of support.\n\nOne asked: \"Oh baby are you ok?\"\n\nAnother hoped Danny hadn't been unfaithful: \"Hope Danny ain't done you like that already\".\n\nOne offered Jourdan some wisdom: \"That's why you should be dealing with men, not boys\".\n\nShe later backtracked, changing the caption to: \"it's banter, me & @itsdannywilliams are fine\".\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDue to their relationship not getting the same villa air time as some of the others and the fact that Danny previously romanced both Yewande Biala and Arabella Chi, people have casted a lot of doubt on the coupling, and they have faced accusations it's \"fake\".\n\nDanny told Capital Breakfast: \"You're in the villa for such a short amount of time, you only know these people for a short amount of time, so feelings aren't that strong and now I'm at a stage with Jourdan where feelings are genuinely strong.\n\n\"But I don't really care if people don't believe it because we know what it is.\"\n\nMaura Higgins and Curtis Pritchard\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nMaura and Curtis have famously taken things slow and still haven't become official boyfriend and girlfriend, despite claiming things are going well.\n\nMaura was also recently forced to deny claims she was flirting with Greg O'Shea after he split from Amber Gill.\n\nThe two Irish islanders appeared on The Late Late Show in the US together, with Curtis also in tow to offer his support.\n\nBut Curtis left for a club appearance, and Greg and Maura continued the party at a whiskey bar with some pals.\n\nThe Sun reported that their flirty behaviour raised some eyebrows, with some even branding it \"disrespectful\".\n\n(Image: WENN.com)\n\nA source said: \"No one was impressed after seeing Greg and Maura on Friday.\n\n\"Amber and Greg had only broken up a few hours ago, so everyone thought it was pretty distasteful and cruel of them - they were all over each other. Curtis came to support them on The Late Late Show and made a brief appearance but had to leave shortly after so he didn't see any of it.\n\n\"The girls aren't that surprised as it's nothing she didn't do in the villa but they are all saying Maura broke the girl code and has shown her true colours by partying with Greg.\n\n\"Poor Amber was sat at home in tears while Maura was out on the town with him - and all over him.\"\n\n(Image: @maurahiggins/Instagram)\n\nMaura denied the claims, saying they are just friends and that she is only dating Curtis.\n\nShe said: \"It's 2019. Just because I'm photographed doesn't mean I'm flirting or sleeping with him.\n\n\"If I was photographed with a girl nothing would be said about it.\n\n\"It's a bit ridiculous. I'm with Curtis, as everyone knows, and Greg is a friend.\"\n\nThe pair hit back at claims they aren't really into each other by kissing in front of photographers - but the picture backfired, with fans branding it \"awkward\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOne fan posted: \"Ummm sorry but I've never seen such a NON KISS ever! Hilarious who are they trying to kid ! Money money money!\"\n\nAnother said: \"The most awkward kiss award goes to....\"\n\nA third wrote: \"Usually when you kiss someone your lips actually make contact.\"\n\n\"Literally zero chemistry between the two of them!\" claimed another.\n\n\"That looks like he's kissing his mum\", said a fifth.\n\nLucie Donlan and Joe Garatt\n\n(Image: Ricky Vigil/Getty Images for Boo)\n\nLucie and Joe split in the villa after Joe was booted out, and their relationship has certainly hit some bumps along the road.\n\nLucie coupled up with Joe on day one, after taking a shine to him when he walked into the villa.\n\nHowever, that night, Tommy Fury and Curtis Pritchard entered the villa and were told they would be able to steal a girl each the following day.\n\nTommy chose Lucie, but she wasn't thrilled at first.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nWhen the opportunity arose on day five, she chose to re-couple with Joe.\n\nThe pair coupled up one more time before Joe was dumped on day 16.\n\nConfused Lucie then confessed her feelings for Tommy several times, but then brought back George Rains from Casa Amor.\n\nLucie and George were dumped from the island shortly after.\n\nThe couple have since announced they are back on after denying it for a while, claiming they were just good friends even after they were pictured kissing.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX)\n\nBecause of Lucie's conflicted feelings, the public cast doubt on whether they genuinely liked each other, or were just conveniently back together for more publicity.\n\nJoe defended the accusations, saying: \"We came out and found each other again. Now everyone can see it's not fake, it's something real.\"\n\nSocial media remains unconvinced that they are for real.\n\nOne person tweeted: \"Lucie and Joe from #LoveIsland are fake af\".\n\n\"Tired of lucie and joe like whatever\" said another bored Tweeter.", "description": "We look at the remaining couples from the show and the scandals they have weathered along the way", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Verity Sulway", "Image", "Pa", "Social Media", "Itv", "Getty Images", "Colin Hawkins Photography Lovehoney", "Instagram", "Wenn.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20158168.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_The-TV-Choice-Awards-2019-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
