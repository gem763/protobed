But many find chefs, friends and even relations trying to trick them into eating dangerously\n\nBen Feltwell is allergic to eggs. Which is why, on a trip to Amsterdam six years ago, he made absolutely sure there was no egg in the pastry he ordered at a French restaurant. \u201cI placed the order and told the waiter I was allergic,\u201d the 31-year-old digital marketer recalls. \u201cHe went off and checked with the kitchen. He spoke with the chef and came back and said it was OK. When the meal came out I said: \u2018Can you guarantee this doesn\u2019t have egg in it?\u2019 The waiter said: \u2018Of course!\u2019\u201d\n\nReassured, Feltwell bit into the pastry \u2013 and immediately had an allergic reaction. He can tell within seconds if a food item contains egg, because his lips begin to tingle.\n\nWhen the chef came out of the kitchen, he was on bellicose form. \u201cHe said: \u2018Well, we make the pastry with egg, but then we fry it and bake it, so there\u2019s no egg left!\u2019\u201d Feltwell took a taxi back to his hotel, where he spent the next four hours vomiting. To add insult to injury, after he left, the restaurant attempted to charge his companions for his meal.\n\nFeltwell laughs in disbelief as he remembers the incident. But it\u2019s not the first time his egg allergy hasn\u2019t been taken seriously, and it probably won\u2019t be the last. \u201cIt\u2019s treated as a dislike, rather than an allergy,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few chefs and waiters tell me to my face that it\u2019s not a real allergy, but a preference. I say: \u2018I think my doctor would beg to differ.\u2019\u201d And it\u2019s not just chefs that Feltwell needs to watch out for. Once, on a camping holiday, a companion slipped an egg into his curry. \u201cHe was trying to make the point that my egg allergy wasn\u2019t real.\u201d He sighs. \u201cIt ruined the holiday.\u201d\n\nFor those with food allergies and intolerances, Feltwell\u2019s experiences may seem familiar. In August, a woman wrote to the Cut website\u2019s advice columnist, Heather Havrilesky, asking how to deal with in-laws who put mushrooms in her food, even though she was severely allergic to them. Her in-laws weren\u2019t just callously disregarding her allergy \u2013 they seemed actively set on harming her, even slipping mushroom powder into the mashed potatoes during a family meal. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse is my husband told me that mushrooms were not a common dish served by his parents before he started dating me.\u201d\n\nIgnoring allergies can kill. In July 2016, 15-year-old Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died on a British Airways flight after suffering an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette she had bought at Stansted airport. She hadn\u2019t realised the baguette contained sesame, to which she was severely allergic, because outlets that make food on-site aren\u2019t required to put allergen advice on their wrappers. There have been other deaths in recent years, including that of 15-year-old Megan Lee, who died after eating a takeaway meal containing peanuts in 2016 (the takeaway\u2019s owner and manager were convicted of manslaughter). And an inquest is considering whether 18-year-old Owen Carey, who died in his girlfriend\u2019s arms following an allergic reaction in April 2017, was served a meal contaminated with wheat and dairy \u2013 to which he had allergies \u2013 at a London burger bar.\n\n\u201cPeople are realising that those with food allergies can die on your premises,\u201d says Leigh George of the charity Allergy UK. She welcomes the introduction of Natasha\u2019s law, to be implemented in 2021, which will require food businesses to publish allergen advice on all pre-packaged food. But George urges the government to go a step further and require catering outlets to list every ingredient on their menus, not just the main allergens, so consumers can make informed choices.\n\nAs a nation, we\u2019re becoming more allergic to the food we eat. According to the Food Standards Agency, in the UK an estimated 2 million people have a food allergy, with an average of 10 food-allergy-related deaths a year. The NHS says that allergy-related hospital admissions increased by 33% between 2011-12 and 2015-16. Meanwhile, Allergy UK reports that between 6% and 8% of children have some form of food allergy. \u201cThe diversity of our diet is one of the drivers of this rise in allergies,\u201d says Dr Isabel Skypala, a consultant allergy dietitian \u201cas people are becoming allergic to food they haven\u2019t eaten before \u2013 like jackfruit.\u201d\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have a life-threatening allergy, having someone disregard your dietary needs can have serious health consequences. Sebastian Clark, 25, a graphic designer from London, was diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder coeliac disease when he was 19. Eating even a trace of gluten will make him extremely ill. \u201cEvery time I eat gluten, I lose half a stone in weight.\u201d Despite this, family and friends don\u2019t always prepare his food with due care \u2013 Clark tells me about one meal at a relative\u2019s house where she slow-cooked a joint of beef. \u201cI said: \u2018This tastes really nice, it\u2019s so rich in flavour.\u2019 And she said: \u2018I put some craft ale in it.\u2019\u201d (Most beer contains gluten.) It took him three weeks to recover from that meal.\n\nClark isn\u2019t the only person to struggle with family members. For Cathy Jones, a clerical officer, meals at her boyfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s house are always fraught with risk because she refuses to accept that Jones\u2019s irritable bowel syndrome \u2013 which is triggered by onions, spring onions and shallots \u2013 isn\u2019t make-believe, and keeps slipping alliums into her food. This year, the mother served Jones a sweet chilli dish \u2013 and made a point of telling her that the recipe had called for spring onions, but that she had left them out. But when they sat down to eat, the dish seemed to have chunks of onion in it. After peering suspiciously at her food, Jones asked the hostess outright \u2013 and was assured that it was only a piece of ginger. But it still looked remarkably onion-like, so her boyfriend tried a bite.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Mum, this tastes like a shallot,\u2019\u201d Jones laughs. \u201cShe said: \u2018OK \u2013 you\u2019ve caught me!\u2019\u201d\n\nJones is remarkably good-humoured about it \u2013 she jokes that she will marry her boyfriend only when his mother accepts she can\u2019t eat onions. But the bit that really winds her up is that the mother doesn\u2019t eat onions herself. \u201cThey give her heartburn! She avoids them as well.\u201d\n\nThe drive home from the mother\u2019s house takes nearly two hours. If Jones unwittingly eats onion before she gets into the car, it\u2019s not pretty. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to make an emergency stop somewhere. Luckily, that hasn\u2019t happened in years.\u201d\n\nWhat makes someone repeatedly ignore someone\u2019s dietary needs, to the extent of compromising their health? Jones doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s malicious: \u201cI think she thinks I don\u2019t like the taste, so if she makes it taste better, I\u2019ll like it.\u201d But it\u2019s also possible that the increasing popularity of influencer-driven elimination diets has made it harder for people with legitimate medical needs to be taken seriously.\n\nThis, after all, is an age where Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop advocates an annual \u201cdetox\u201d that cuts out caffeine, alcohol, dairy, gluten, corn, nightshades, soy, refined sugar, shellfish, white rice and eggs; when supermodel Elle Macpherson endorses the alkaline diet; and when \u201cclean-eating\u201d gurus such as Madeleine Shaw and Amelia Freer secure lucrative publishing deals. Free-from regimes are sold as the cure to all of life\u2019s ills, boosted by a swarm of quasi-reputable nutritionists, often on beautifully photographed blogs.\n\nTanya Khan, 21, a student from Warwick who is lactose-, egg- and gluten-intolerant, gets frustrated when her dietary requirements are viewed as a lifestyle choice. \u201cYou can\u2019t put someone\u2019s health condition on a par with veganism,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. If they ate meat, something physically wouldn\u2019t happen to them \u2013 but if I had ice-cream, I would be really ill.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, food outlets that treat terms such as \u201cgluten-free\u201d as little more than buzzwords gamble with people\u2019s health. Chloe Marvin, 23, a civil servant from London, is intolerant to gluten, and allergic to nuts, beans and sesame. She recently got into a row with a food-truck worker, after she saw him put breaded ham into her \u201cgluten-free\u201d crepe. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019ve advertised it as a gluten-free crepe; I can\u2019t eat gluten.\u2019 He said: \u2018Well, the crepe is gluten-free; this is how ham comes.\u2019\u201d\n\nNathalie Newman has seen the damaging effects of influencer-driven fad diets first-hand. The 38-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, runs the popular blog the Intolerant Gourmand, which she founded after her son Callum was diagnosed with 28 allergies, eight of which are life-threatening. Newman works with chefs to make their menus allergy-safe. \u201cThey tell me that patrons come in and say they\u2019re dairy-free or gluten-free, or even coeliacs, so they take it seriously, and then a dessert will go past and they\u2019ll say: \u2018Oh, that looks amazing.\u2019 The chef says: \u2018You can\u2019t eat that,\u2019 and they\u2019ll go: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s OK \u2013 a little bit won\u2019t hurt.\u2019 So when someone who has a true allergy comes in and says: \u2018I can\u2019t eat that,\u2019 who do they trust and believe?\u201d Newman is convinced this behaviour puts people at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s quite scary.\u201d\n\nWhen restaurant staff conflate genuine allergy sufferers with fussy eaters, patrons with legitimate health conditions find themselves under scrutiny. Jenny Allen, 35, a teacher from Oldham, follows a gluten-free diet to mitigate the symptoms of her postpartum thyroiditis. (Some believe that autoimmune conditions such as thyroiditis can be managed with the help of a gluten-free diet, although the scientific evidence is not conclusive. Allen herself believes that avoiding gluten has helped.) Recently, she was in a cafe and asked for a gluten-free meal. \u201cThey said: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s all the rage at the minute, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a trendy thing to do.\u201d The comment made her feel \u201csilly and ridiculous\u201d. In particular, Allen chafed at having to justify herself to a perfect stranger. \u201cHaving to explain something really complex over a baguette,\u201d Allen sighs. \u201cI\u2019m like: I flipping loved bread before! I\u2019d rather be sitting here eating a crunchy baguette, and not having to explain my backstory.\u201d\n\nIf restaurant staff aren\u2019t properly trained, supposedly allergen-free meals can easily be contaminated. Feltwell was made sick at an Italian restaurant that prepared his food on the same work surface as a florentine pizza, which has egg on it. Marvin had to run out of a south London restaurant recently after going into a sesame-induced anaphylactic shock from a shakshuka dish. She chose not to complain, even though she had disclosed her sesame allergy when ordering. \u201cMy friend said: \u2018Do you want to say anything? I said: \u2018No, not really.\u2019 It makes me really uncomfortable. Having an argument in a restaurant is unpleasant and draining.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not only restaurant staff you need to worry about \u2013 Khan has grown used to being accidentally poisoned at home. \u201cI get lactose-free butter and other people use it and you end up with breadcrumbs in there,\u201d she sighs.\n\nWhen you have specific dietary needs, eating out can feel like an ordeal. \u201cIt creates so much anxiety ... there\u2019s always a huge buildup to food,\u201d says Marvin. She tends to patronise places she has eaten at before, and knows to be safe. \u201cEveryone else can say: \u2018This looks like a nice place,\u2019 and wander in there. But that gives me the fear. For me, eating out is a huge thing. The evening before, I need to research the restaurant, and check their allergy menu. And even when I\u2019m out, I feel anxious beforehand and anxious when I\u2019m eating. Your trust has been broken by all these bad experiences.\u201d\n\nSome people don\u2019t think the risk is worth it \u2013 such as Mike Dancer, 53, a retired teacher from Reigate, Surrey, who follows a ketogenic diet to manage his epilepsy. (These low-carbohydrate, high-fat, controlled-protein regimes are proven to help control seizures in some people.) \u201cI tend to travel with Tupperware boxes full of food,\u201d Dancer says. Once, at an international conference in Italy, he was unable to eat any of the food provided \u2013 so he simply didn\u2019t eat for five days.\n\nHaving specific dietary needs is often socially isolating. \u201cIt can rule your life,\u201d says George. \u201cWhere the majority of us take it for granted that it\u2019s our birthday, or a Friday night, and we can go out for dinner, imagine how you\u2019d feel if you thought that eating that meal could kill you. It makes socialising extremely difficult and stressful.\u201d\n\nOn work trips, Marvin tends to eat separately from her colleagues, in restaurants she knows to be safe.\n\nLife is so much easier when everyone respects your needs. After years of carrying his lunch around with him, Dancer was recently able to enjoy a meal of barbecued fish, avocado and salad with friends at Rockfish in Brixham, Devon. \u201cIt was a very inclusive feeling, to be honest. To be part of the group that\u2019s eating is very important. I felt at long last that I was allowed back with the group.\u201d\n\nSome names have been changed.", "description": "For those with severe food allergies, every meal can feel like a game of Russian roulette.
