It was more intimate, but we couldn\u2019t fit more people,\u201d Klum said of the pair's nuptials. \u201cIt was great. We danced until the sun came up, and it was nice because no one\u2019s feet were hurting. It was so magical.\u201d\n\nOf Kaulitz, 30, the \"America's Got Talent: Champions\" judge gushed: \u201cHe\u2019s really game for anything. We\u2019re very similar that way.
