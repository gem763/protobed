The child has required multiple surgeries for head trauma and broken bones since the attack.\n\nIn April, a man who did not know Landen or his family grabbed the boy and threw him nearly 40 feet to the ground off of the third-story balcony at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. That man, 25-year-old Emmanuel Aranda, was charged with attempted premeditated murder in the April 12 incident. He pleaded guilty in May and was sentenced to 19 years in prison.\n\nAranda allegedly told investigators he went to the mall \u201clooking for someone to kill\u201d after past instances of women repeatedly rejecting his advances. Aranda filed a notice Friday to appeal his case to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. The notice did not give a reason for appealing, Minneapolis\u2019 Star Tribune reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe GoFundMe page raised more than $1 million for Landen\u2019s family.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A five-year-old boy who nearly five months ago was thrown off of the third-story balcony at the Mall of America in Minnesota by a complete stranger returned home from the hospital Tuesday, according to family.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/landen-hoffman.jpg"}
