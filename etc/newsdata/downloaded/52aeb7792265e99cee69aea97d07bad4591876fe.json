They also said the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys failed to present any evidence of actual harm.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis decision is inconsistent with multiple determinations outside of Philadelphia regarding the adequacy of the Risperdal labeling, the medicine\u2019s efficacy, and findings in support of the company,\u201d Johnson & Johnson said. \u201cWe will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
