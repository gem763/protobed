It was actually a very peaceful, calming experience.\"\n\nMs Burns wants people who have seen the breathtaking footage of her frolicking in the water alongside Deep Blue to see a less aggressive side of sharks, which often only make headlines during attacks.\n\n\"She was very graceful, very slow because of her size - As Ocean likes to call her a 'grandma shark'\", Ms Burns said.\n\nShe said Deep Blue was docile and could differentiate between food and humans.\n\nThe group went out at sunrise and Deep Blue stayed with their boat for the majority of the day.\n\nMs Burns said a pod of dolphins also joined in on the fun, nose-tapping Deep Blue as a seemingly friendly gesture.\n\nKayleigh Burns said people have the wrong idea about sharks, after meeting the great white close up for the first time. (9news)\n\nHawaii waters are usually too warm for great whites compared with California's Pacific coast, where they feed on sea lions and elephant seals. But, when a whale carcass emerges, it brings a range of new wildlife into the waters.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a statement that the decomposing whale carcass had drifted about 13 kilometres south of Pearl Harbour after being towed 24 kilometres offshore days earlier.\n\nThe department said tiger sharks have been \"almost continuously\" feeding on the whale and said it was aware of photos of the great white.\n\nThe agency's Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement, Chief Jason Redull, said people should stay out of the water around the dead whale.\n\nThe large pregnant mammal was in the waters feeding on a dead sperm whale that had washed in from Pearl Harbour. (9news)\n\n\"We don't want anyone to get hurt if a shark swimming around the carcass mistakes them as food. Understandably, some people want to get into the water either out of fascination or to get photographs, but it is truly dangerous to be around this carcass with so much shark activity,\" he said.\n\nThe agency said there are reports people climbed on top of the whale carcass and removed its teeth, which may be a violation of state and federal laws.\n\nOfficials said the carcass it is currently drifting away from shore, but a predicted shift in the winds could once again push it back toward Oahu.\n\nDeep Blue is believed to be the largest white shark ever recorded.\n\nMs Ramsey told local media that big pregnant sharks are often the safest to be around, because they've seen it all and are rarely threatened.\n\nThe giant great white was bigger than six metres and was very docile around the intrigued divers off the coast of Oahu.
