He fell in love with the place and decided to settle there forever. Now owns a shack known as Koleso.\n\n\u201cI had no idea about the sea. I just reached Mudgaon railway station with no idea about it whatsoever. We asked someone where\u2019s the beach? That way, he replied, and we ended up walking 8 kilometers in that direction and by that time it was evening already,\" Jackie tells about his first encounter with Goa.\n\nDon't Miss 14.3 K SHARES 6.3 K SHARES 3.3 K SHARES 4.9 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES\n\nJackie says that he had a strange feeling after seeing the sea. \"But it looked as if the sea was welcoming us,\" he says.\n\n\"I told m friend: look at the waves, they are coming towards us,\" he fondly remembers.\n\nHe slept all night at the beach.\n\n\"This journey has been like a dream. I don\u2019t know how 10 years have passed. There was no difference between day and night,\" he says.\n\nJackie is a known name in Goa. People from across the world come to his shack.

We ask them what happens in their countries and take their advice to make things better here,\" he says.\n\nAccording to Jackie, Goa is a place where people learn to communicate with others naturally. He shares an example of his mother, who does not no any other language apart from the vernacular spoken in Himachal. But once she was here, she was quite comfortable communicating with others through gestures.\n\n\"Once my mother came here she wanted to know what keeps me busy here. One day I found her with a couple of tourists, a French and a Russian. I was just observing them and wondered how they were communicating. My mother didn\u2019t know French or Russian, yet they were quite comfortable with each other. They were very happy sharing food.\"\n\nJackie gives full credit of his success to his team that works round the clock to make his business a successful venture.\n\n\"For running such a place you need energy and experience. My staff is quite reliable. They work with passion. For them life is never boring, they inspire each other for work. And that reflects in the way this shack is run. Together they manage to keep this restaurant open for 24 hours,\" he says.\n\n\"I have named it Koleso, I Russian it means a wheel that keeps on rolling,\" says an elated Jackie.", "description": "There are some ordinary people with extra-ordinary plans in life.
