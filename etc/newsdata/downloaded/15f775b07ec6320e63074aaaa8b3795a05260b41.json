For some reason, my sketch was not like that. It was more of a fitted dress which went straight down.\n\n(Image: Gemma Lynch / SWNS)\n\n\"I was amazed as it was really similar to the type of dress that I had already ordered for my wedding the next month.\n\n\"I just can't believe as a 15-year-old girl Gemma A predicted that's the type of dress I would end up going to wear 22 years later.\"\n\nGemma donned the elegant dress as she married her partner of five years Daniel Astbury, 41, at a low key ceremony at the Cala D'or Yacht Club in Majorca on August 29.\n\nThe happy couple then had a separate reception last Saturday at the DoubleTree Hilton in Chester, for wider family and friends.\n\nGemma met tree surgeon Daniel online, the couple moving into a home together in Chester alongwith their 18 month year old daughter, Isla, who was also a flower girl at their special day.\n\nThe beaming bride said the reception, which included an American Diner themed menu and a harpist welcoming guests to the venue, went off without a hitch.\n\nThe nursery inspector added: \"Gemma Albiston didn't come to the one in Majorca but she came to the one in Chester on Saturday night.\n\n(Image: Gemma Lynch / SWNS)\n\n(Image: Gemma Lynch / SWNS)\n\n\"We still get together. We still go to important events like christenings, birthdays and weddings.\n\n\"I think we're supposed to be doing something soon. I think Emma, who originally organised the time capsule, is going to try and get us all together again.\n\n\"She said we shouldn't leave it another 22 years getting all six of us together. so it's in the pipeline for us to have another catch up soon.\"\n\nThis summer both Gemmas met up with friends Emma Page, Sian McGreary, Gemma Roughsedge and Katy Wynne to dig up their old time capsule.\n\nThe women, who had all lost touch over the years, returned in search of their old memories armed with shovels and metal detectors after Emma, who came up with the idea in 97 while watching Blue Peter, contacted the girls on Facebook .\n\nThe group were left \"screaming with joy\" after they unearthed the steel cylinder before taking it back to Sian's parents' home to reminisce with a bottle of prosecco.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nGemma L said that digging up the time capsule was a \"day to remember filled with emotion, love and laughter.\"\n\nShe said: \"We put a lot of things in there, we had photos, predictions of our futures, our favourite snacks and friendship bracelets.\n\n\"We put Twiglets, Wrigleys Extra chewing gum and coins in case they changed over the years.\n\n\"Inside was books that we sprayed with our favourite perfumes, one was called Fuzzy Peach and the other was called Dewbury, I used to wear those perfumes in 1997.\n\n\"There was a couple of magazines we would've read at the time, like Just Seventeen and posters of boys we fancied like Peter Andre.\"\n\nTo find the image of the Mysterious Girl hunk the group had to work out where exactly they planted the capsule.\n\n\"We knew roughly where it was as it was the spot were we would drink, it was around these massive six-foot rocks,\" Gemma continued.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\"About half a meter into the ground we hit it with our spades and we all started screaming because we couldn't believe we found it.\n\n\"After carrying it down the hill, we took it to Sian's parents house as they lived close by.\n\n\"We used tools to get it open and eventually we got inside, we then cracked a bottle of fizz open, had some nibbles and reminisced all afternoon.\"\n\nGemma A, a dog groomer from Kelsall, Cheshire, said: \"When Gemma opened the letter after we found the time capsule, she immediately said 'wow, this is very very similar to my dress.'\n\n\"When we were at a wedding reception on Saturday, we saw that it was pretty much the same dress, which was a surprise. It was uncanny.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\"We clearly must have known each other very well back then and what good friends we were. Quite a lot of it was very accurate.\n\n\"It was nice for us all to be together. We've decided we are all going to go out again soon and have drinks together. It was so nice to see everyone again at the same time.\"", "description": "Gemm Lynch was amazed to discover her friend had predicted what she would wear down the isle 22 years before she did", "authors": ["Tom Hitchenor", "Image", "Gemma Lynch", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564743.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_CAPSULE_DRESS_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
