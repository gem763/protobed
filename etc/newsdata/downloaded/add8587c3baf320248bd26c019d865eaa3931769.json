(David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nNBA executive Daryl Morey inadvertently sparked an international incident this weekend, when a Twitter post supporting human rights protesters in Hong Kong was met with a swift backlash in China.\n\nMorey, the Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager who is in Japan with the team for a pair of preseason games against the Toronto Raptors, posted an image to his Twitter account on Friday that bore a simple message: \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHis account was quickly bombarded by angry replies before he deleted the message. Some social media users replied with \u201cNMSL\u201d \u2014 Chinese Internet slang that means \u201cyour mother is dead\u201d \u2014 and called for Morey, who has been with the Rockets since 2006, to be fired. Others replied by hailing his support for the Hong Kong protesters, who began demonstrating in June in opposition to a proposal to a bill that would allow individuals to be extradited from Hong Kong to China.\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta hastily issued a response Friday to the growing criticism.\n\n\u201cListen, Daryl Morey does NOT speak for the Houston Rockets,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cOur presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d In a follow-up statement to ESPN, Fertitta clarified that he was merely intending to quell the \u201chuge backlash\u201d with his Twitter post and that \u201ceverything is fine with Daryl and me.\u201d\n\nBut the fallout was just beginning. The Rockets are one of the most popular and highest-profile NBA teams in China, given that they drafted Chinese legend Yao Ming with the top pick in 2002. The franchise has a Chinese-language website and has designed and worn themed Lunar New Year jerseys, among other marketing efforts. Morey wasn\u2019t just an American outsider weighing in on what China views as a domestic matter; he was also the prominent face of a high-profile company with long-standing Chinese ties and legions of Chinese supporters.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association and Tencent Sports, the NBA\u2019s rights holder in China, announced they would cut ties with the Rockets, in statements translated by reporter Yu Fu. The Rockets\u2019 Chinese sponsors reportedly followed suit, as did the Chinese Consulate in Houston, which urged the franchise to \u201ccorrect the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact\u201d of Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nMultiple Democratic presidential candidates weighed in on the Chinese response, with entrepreneur Andrew Yang calling it a \u201cterrible move\u201d and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio, accusing China of \u201cusing its economic power to silence critics \u2014 even those in the [United States].\u201d Castro added that the United States \u201cmust lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\nThe backlash and ensuing controversy put the NBA and the Rockets in an uncomfortable bind: Were they willing to jeopardize their Chinese relationships by standing up for the pro-democracy voices in Hong Kong, or would they bend to the Chinese position on the protest in an effort to maintain their business partnerships? Would Morey become a sacrificial lamb?\n\nBy Sunday, the league appeared to be attempting to thread the needle by acknowledging the negative response to Morey\u2019s message while stopping short of disciplining him or weighing in on the protests.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nMorey also issued a statement, saying that he \u201cdid not intend to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends\u201d in China.\n\n\u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\u201d his statement read. \u201cI have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has made no secret of its desire to cultivate basketball in China despite the potential for political complications, with Commissioner Adam Silver pointing to the country as an \u201cenormous opportunity\u201d at the NBA Finals in June. When asked whether he was concerned about rising tensions between the countries, which include an ongoing trade war, Silver dismissed the notion.\n\n\u201cI am not concerned at this time,\u201d he said in June. \u201cWe are not immune from global politics, so it\u2019s something we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to. I look to sports, and this is something Yao and I have discussed, where we can use basketball maybe in the way ping-pong was used in the days of Richard Nixon. There could be something called basketball diplomacy, and it is an area where our two countries have an excellent history of cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe NBA launched NBA China to manage its operations in the country in 2008. More than 600 million fans in China consumed NBA content during the 2017-18 season, according to CNBC, and the NBA has announced major new agreements with Tencent and Alibaba this year to serve Chinese viewers. The league has held games in China since 2004, and the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets are set to play preseason games in China on Thursday and Saturday. Joseph Tsai, the billionaire co-founder of Alibaba, finalized his ownership takeover of the Nets this summer with a pair of transactions that totaled $2.35 billion, the record price for an NBA franchise.\n\nRead more:\n\nLeBron James continues fight against NCAA, announcing support of Fair Pay to Play Act\n\nEven with a lift from Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Clippers plan to keep doing the dirty work\n\nKyrie Irving shines a light on an overlooked issue in the NBA: grief\n\nAfter a long summer, LeBron James eases back onto center stage with the Lakers\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox", "description": "The backlash put the NBA and the Rockets in an uncomfortable bind.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter", "October At Pm", "Ben Golliver Joined The Washington Post As The National Nba Writer In Previously", "He Was A Senior Writer At Sports Illustrated Covering The Nba.
