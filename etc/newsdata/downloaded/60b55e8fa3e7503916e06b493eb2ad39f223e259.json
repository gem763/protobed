For about three hours, officials said groups lingered at various gates outside the Nevada Testing and Training Range, which encompasses the so-called Area 51 site.\n\nBut the relative calm of the morning gave way to more hectic reports as the crowds grew in Rachel and the nearby towns of Alamo and Hiko, Nev.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, at least two people had been arrested since the first revelers started to arrive Thursday night, Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry D. Lee told The Washington Post. One person was arrested for public indecency after urinating on a gate, and another was booked after an alcohol-related arrest turned up an outstanding warrant. Lee said a few more people were taken into custody for trespassing and released, and one person was injured in a rollover accident.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really picking up. We\u2019re getting hundreds of visitors right now at the Rachel gate,\u201d Lee said Friday afternoon.\n\n\n\nA map of the region surrounding the government site known as Area 51 in Nevada.\n\nEric Holt, the fire chief and emergency manager for Lincoln County, told The Post that about 1,500 people had arrived in both Rachel and Hiko on Thursday night. With virtually no accommodations, people were camped out in RVs, cars and tents.\n\nEven though the tourists numbering in the thousands is a far cry from the more than 2 million who responded to the online event, Holt said just 10,000 tourists more than doubles the local population and pushes resources to the brink.\n\n\u201cIf we get ten thousand people, it overwhelms our gas stations and grocery stores. The county of ten thousand square miles with a population of about 5,000,\u201d Holt said.\n\nThe town of Rachel, for instance, has just 54 residents. The closest gas station is in Alamo, about 60 miles away. Holt worried about out-of-towners unfamiliar with the remoteness of the area.\n\n[Half a million people signed up to storm Area 51. What happens if they actually show?]\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming out to the desert thinking Las Vegas is hot, but it gets cold in the desert. And they need to bring extra food, gas and water to support their travel needs,\u201d Holt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a definitely burden on our economy and our emergency resources.\u201d\n\nHolt, for instance, had been up at 4 a.m. after ending the previous day\u2019s shift at 11 p.m. The neighboring Nye County Sheriff\u2019s Office and other state public safety entities are assisting with the response.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long week,\u201d Holt said.\n\nLater in the day, Lee had a more optimistic view noting that, all things considered, the situation was going well: \u201cThe service stations haven\u2019t run out of gas, they brought food trucks in \u2026 and I\u2019ve seen some very interesting costumes. I\u2019m pretty impressed with it.\u201d\n\nHe said as the number of people at the event sites swells from the hundreds to the thousands, the complaints have remained minor.\n\n\u201cWe had some calls at the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn,\u201d Lee said of an Alamo, Nev.-based inn that\u2019s serving as one of the base camps. \u201cBut they\u2019re squabbles \u2014 \u2018get out of my campsite\u2019 stuff.\u201d\n\nA weird event gets weirder\n\nThe event\u2019s creator, 21-year-old Matty Roberts, technically pulled the plug on the gathering in early September over fears of a potential \u201chumanitarian disaster.\u201d\n\nThe Bakersfield, Calif., college student first created the Facebook event this summer as a harmless joke; at best, maybe it would inspire a few good alien memes. Instead, it mushroomed into a viral spectacle that became a magnet for media attention (and scrutiny from the Air Force).\n\nRoberts then parlayed his joke event into a real-life festival dubbed \u201cAlienstock.\u201d He set his sights on the tiny town of Rachel and even found a local business partner in Connie West, the owner of the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn. But as interest in the festival grew, so did Roberts\u2019s concern that thousands of people would overwhelm a 54-person town with no gas station or grocery store.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no safety or security that can really be promised,\u201d Roberts told The Post at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable with inviting even my friends and family out to this event, let alone these thousands of strangers.\u201d\n\nWith barely two weeks to go, Roberts declared Alienstock in Rachel canceled, over West\u2019s objections. Roberts then announced he was counterprogramming a three-day festival \u2014 the official Alienstock \u2014 at a convention center in Las Vegas, complete with sponsors like Bud Light, Arby\u2019s and Kool-Aid.\n\nWest said she would hold the music and art-filled festival without Roberts\u2019s involvement, despite his lawyer sending her a cease-and-desist letter.\n\n[The government admits it studies UFOs. So about those Area 51 conspiracy theories \u2026]\n\nAsked Thursday about the road from late-night online joke to corporate-sponsored three-day festival, Roberts indicated he had moved past the desert dust-up and plans to ride the alien party wave as long as he can.\n\n\u201cWho could have predicted this?\u201d Roberts said to KTNV 13 in Las Vegas. \u201cYou make a post at 2 a.m. on a page that has 62 likes and now you have thousands of people that are ready to come out to your show.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThese Dutch vloggers wanted to visit Area 51.
