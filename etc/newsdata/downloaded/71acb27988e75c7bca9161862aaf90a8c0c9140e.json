In addition, users can also go into the General Settings option and toggle it on or off.", "description": "Android users have been able to scroll their feeds using the new design for a few days, but this is the first time the feature is available on Apple's iOS, which recently introduced system-wide dark mode.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com", "Stacy Liberatore"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/21/18935684-0-image-a-78_1569444941976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
