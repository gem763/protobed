It\u2019s a brief 30-second clip that begins in the game\u2019s original fuzzy resolution, before transitioning to the crisp new reworked designs for modern screens. It\u2019s bringing me back to the person I was when I first played C&C, and I\u2019m scared of that person. He was a menace.\n\nWhen it comes to real-time strategy games, the Command & Conquer franchise doesn\u2019t hold the same revered status as, say, StarCraft. Instead, it\u2019s become more of a cult fave, famous for its cheeky, low-budget cutscenes full of hammy acting and ridiculous plots. I, however, loved them\u2014probably because that was the game we had in my house, not StarCraft.\n\nEither way, the Command & Conquer games were perfect for making me a young strategy cornball. Playing with my cousin on the weekends, we would infuriate each other with truly bad ideas that would never stand for even a minute if we took them online\u2014which we tried, and got sent packing. We would send each other cheap infantry units in single file, endlessly. We would bum rush each other with our starting squads, racing to build bases in the same corner of the map. We would build an incredibly large army and just sit there, waiting for the other to come, until they never did and then we had to log off.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have the word for it then, but I guess we were a couple of knucklehead trolls.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s something specific to Command & Conquer that encouraged this kind of buffoonery\u2014every game has its cheese, you know? But Command & Conquer definitely made it satisfying to pull off. The ridiculous, catchy music, the simple interface, the light sci-fi elements that made everything kind of comic-booky but only a little bit\u2014if you were young enough, like we were, you could lie to yourself and say you were an Actual Badass General of a totally realistic army.\n\nIt\u2019s probably worth apologizing in advance for my behaviour when this remaster drops. I doubt I\u2019ll be any good, but I\u2019ll be annoying as hell.", "description": "On Wednesday, EA Games released the first gameplay footage of Command & Conquer: Remastered.
