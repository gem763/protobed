But his grin was quickly wiped off and he was left standing bewildered as Wighton walked on stage\n\nMost agree the medal was given to the most deserving player, making Wighton only the fourth player to receive the medal from a losing team\n\nBut his grin was quickly wiped off and he was left standing bewildered as Wighton walked on stage.\n\nThe footage also shows NRL CEO Todd Greenberg telling presenter James Bracey that the winner was Wighton not Waerea-Hargreaves, narrowly avoiding a mix-up.\n\nWaerea-Hargreaves was forced to stand on the wings of the presentation stage as Wighton accepted the award.\n\nThe winner is decided by Australian selectors Laurie Daley, Mal Meninga and Darren Lockyer after they vote through an app.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that Lockyer's votes were yet to be tallied, and it was his vote that edged Wighton out in front.\n\nDespite Wighton's individual success, he struggled to hide his disappointment after his team failed to break their 25-year premiership drought.\n\nThe title was awarded to Canberra Raiders five eighth Jack Wighton, but Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, from the victorious Sydney Roosters side, was told only minutes earlier that he had won\n\nThe Sydney Roosters rule the roost once again after claiming back to back NRL premierships in a controversial grand final\n\n'It was a very numb feeling to achieve something so big, it was probably the worst moment of my life, losing a grand final,' Wighton said.\n\n'At the same time I am extremely proud of the boys, I love every single one of them and our actions next year will tell us whether we're going to back it up. I'm very proud of the boys, it's just a very weird feeling at the minute.'\n\nCanberra coach Ricky Stuart agreed with the selection panel, agreeing his player was best on field.\n\n'The best player on the field got the award,' Stuart said. 'Whether those people out there that booed agree or not, Jack didn't pick it. Three legends of our game picked the award.\n\nReferee Ben Cummins (in yellow) had his hand up signalling six more tackles before the Roosters end up with the ball\n\n'I think they know a little bit more than the wombats sitting in there behind the goals.'\n\nThe mix-up was one of a handful of moments during and after the game which has dominated headlines.\n\nTIMELINE OF CONTROVERSIES 3rd minute: Charged down kick which could have led to a Canberra Raiders try hit a Sydney Roosters trainer on the field in the head. 6th minute: The Sydney Roosters draw first blood when hooker Sam Verrills scores the first game of the match 49th minute: Josh Papalii denied a penalty try when he was tackled without the ball. Cooper Cronk was sin-binned over the incident. 71st minute: The Roosters were given the ball back deep in Raiders territory when the referees initially waved six more tackles to Canberra but then changed their minds. 73rd minute: Roosters full-back James Tedesco races away to score the match-winning try.\n\nThe Sydney Roosters' 14-8 premiership victory was marred by an outrageous blunder by referees Ben Cummins and Gerard Sutton with seven minutes to go and the score dead-locked at 8-all on Sunday evening.\n\nCummins waved 'six again' when he ruled Roosters full back James Tedesco had touched the ball when attempting to catch a bomb before reversing his decision - but the confusion led to drama.\n\nRaiders five-eight Jack Wighton, thinking he had another set of six tackles up his sleeve with seven minutes to go and the scores locked up, took the tackle in front of the posts instead of kicking the ball.\n\nSutton then informed him that it was the sixth tackle and he had to hand the ball over, which almost immediately led to the Roosters' game-winning try.\n\nRoosters winger Daniel Tupou made a break from inside his own half before putting full-back James Tedesco away for a try.\n\nIn the opening stages, a charged down kick which could have led to a Canberra Raiders try hit the Sydney Roosters physio on the field at the time, in the head.\n\nThe Raiders were also denied a penalty try when Josh Papalii was tackled without the ball metres from the try-line, which resulted in the sin-binning of retiring Roosters star Cooper Cronk.", "description": "The victorious\u00a0Roosters prop was told that he had won the award and was preparing to collect it during the post-match presentation.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain", "Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/04/19425626-0-image-a-15_1570506237498.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
