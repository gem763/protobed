Photo: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt least six Democratic presidential candidates have released statements calling for the impeachment or removal of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh after new details supporting and adding to the sexual misconduct allegations against him were revealed over the weekend.\n\nIn an excerpt published Saturday from their new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly revealed corroborating accounts which supported Deborah Ramirez\u2019s allegation that Kavanaugh once pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her during a dorm party while they both attended Yale. Pogrebin and Kelly also reported a new allegation that someone else had seen Kavanaugh do something similar to another woman at an entirely different party at the school, and that the witness had informed the FBI about it. The FBI never investigated his account, the authors explained, nor the accounts of dozens of people with corroborating evidence about what happened to Ramirez \u2014 whose allegation was dismissed by Senate investigators as lacking that very evidence.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, the removal of Justice Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court, the insufficient FBI investigation, and the GOP\u2019s de-facto coverup had become front-of-mind for many Democratic lawmakers and others on the left. It had also become a 2020 issue when, one by one, Democratic presidential candidates began weighing in on the matter. \u201cConfirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing,\u201d Elizabeth Warren wrote in a tweet. \u201cLike the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris tweeted the same, arguing that Kavanaugh \u201cwas put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke both tweeted that Kavanaugh lied under oath and should be impeached, and Castro called for a Congressional review of how the Justice Department handled the investigation.\n\nPete Buttigieg also released a statement calling for answers about the investigation, and said that \u201cKavanaugh should resign and if he doesn\u2019t, the House should impeach him.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders didn\u2019t mention impeachment in his response, commenting that Kavanaugh shouldn\u2019t have been nominated in the first place and \u201clikely lied\u201d during his testimony. Sanders endorsed \u201cany appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold [Kavanaugh] accountable.\u201d\n\nI asked @clairecmc what Democrats should do with the latest allegation against Kavanaugh.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure honestly. That was such a mess. And what it did for those of us who were running, it crystallized how bad Washington is.\" #MTP \u2014 Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 15, 2019\n\nJoe Biden did not join the impeachment parade, either, calling only for an investigation. In a statement released Sunday night, the former vice president said that the new book\u2019s reporting raised \u201cprofoundly troubling questions about the integrity of [Kavanaugh\u2019s] confirmation process,\u201d and that \u201cwe need to get to the bottom\u201d of how it may have been influenced by the Trump administration and Senate GOP. \u201cWe must follow the evidence to wherever it leads,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cDoing this the right way is critically important in getting the truth and restoring the American people\u2019s faith in their government.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday morning, Amy Klobuchar had also pushed off impeachment talk in favor of an investigation during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week. She said she was concerned that the process a \u201csham,\u201d but said she wanted to see some documented evidence of what happened. Later, however, she celebrated Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 who testified under oath about the sexual assault she said she survived as a teen after being confronted by Kavanaugh and his friend at a party.\n\nLet us never forget what courage looks like. pic.twitter.com/2bRD8s8sda \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) September 15, 2019\n\nAlso on Sunday, President Trump and many of his allies on the right seemed happy to rehash the Kavanaugh fight and the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201csmear\u201d narratives deployed to frame it. Trump tweeted attacks on the media about Kavanaugh and suggested that \u201cthe Justice Department should come to his rescue.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s authoritarian directives aside, Kavanaugh will in all likelihood need no rescuing from impeachment. There has only been one impeachment of a Supreme Court justice in American history, back in the 1800s, and no justice has ever been removed from the Court. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect that one could be now either \u2014 particularly in the current political environment. The successful impeachment, conviction, and removal of Kavanaugh would require Democrats taking back the White House, keeping the House (where they already can\u2019t agree to impeach Trump,) and obtaining a like-minded supermajority in the Senate (where Democrats barely have a chance to win even a simple majority in 2020.)\n\nSo Justice Kavanaugh is probably here to stay. And the new allegations about him and the investigation into his conduct have reignited what is arguably the most contentious single political battle of the Trump era.\n\nIt also was and is a fight worth having, and one that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten come election year.\n\nThis post was updated to include Biden\u2019s statement.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
