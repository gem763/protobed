Demand for those magnets is expected to rise by six per cent annually between now and 2030. As a result, the NdPr market is expected to be short by the early 2020s.\n\nEyes wide open\n\nAccording to Uren\u2019s analysis, Australia is expected to \u201cplug the gap\u201d of supply by increasing production from 18,600 tonnes last year to 50,100 tonnes by 2025.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s national interest is in the development of its resources ahead of those in other prospective countries,\u201d Uren reports. \u201cOf the several dozen rare earth projects around the world, no more than four or five would have a prospect of being funded over the next five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHowever, governments would have to go into any rare earths ventures with their eyes open to the possibility of losing money. The history of rare earths is that they are often in oversupply, with low prices leaving many operators struggling to make a profit.\n\n\u201cAustralia has difficulty in crafting programs specifically for a sector like rare earths, even if it believed there were elements of market failure in the failure to develop established resources,\u201d Uren continued before offering a few examples of how a one-size-fits-all commodities approach might fail the test of rare earths.\n\nHe noted that the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) had received funding applications from both Arafura Resources and Hastings Technology. The problem is, though, anything NAIF does can only be supplementary to an already secure funding base. And that doesn\u2019t yet exist.\n\nUren also described how Northern Minerals \u2013 arguably the next most likely to join Australia\u2019s rare earths pioneer Lynas as a producer of importance \u2013 was left \u201cfinancially stretched\u201d by the rejection of its application for a research and development grant.\n\n\u201cNorthern was among a number of small resource companies which had claims for R &D grants rejected,\u201d Uren noted.\n\n\u201cThe decision that it did not qualify for the R &D grant came after it had already received $13.4 million, which it was required to repay to the Tax Office, and also meant it did not receive $10.8 million it was counting on.''\n\nNorthern lost out because the ATO decided that a pilot plant did not qualify as an R &D project.\n\nGo figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for prospective producers in Australia and elsewhere is that projects are not bankable: banks will not lend to a project when the pricing is as opaque as it is with rare earths,\u201d Uren assessed.\n\n\u201cEquity markets are similarly unprepared to deliver the capital required to bring these projects to life.''\n\nReasons for caution\n\nUren notes that China remains an obvious source of funding for the local rare earths sector and, it has to be said, here he takes a more liberal tack than I might.\n\n\u201cIt may be that the best prospect for financing the development of Australia\u2019s incipient rare earth projects rests with China, a possibility that the Foreign Investment Review Board needs to consider,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s national security is not jeopardised by Chinese participation in Australia\u2019s rare earths industry any more than by its participation in iron ore or coal sectors.''\n\nI would be more cautious.\n\nChina\u2019s direct investment in the steel raw materials supply chain landed in an already mature industry that, outside of new players, was largely capable of funding its own progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt landed too at a time of market evolution that saw relatively opaque pricing mechanisms replaced by index pricing that allowed for relatively transparent price discovery.\n\nFor all of that, it ought to be recalled that one of the primary missions of BHP\u2019s successful attempt to unpick the legendarily bonkers $US20 billion strategic alliance Rio Tinto proposed with Chinalco in 2009 was to close the door to Chinese reach into assets such as Rio Tinto iron ore.\n\nEffectively, BHP needed to ensure that China had neither the ownership leverage nor the unfettered access to operational data that was an explicit product of the strategic alliance between Rio and Chinalco.\n\nAustralia\u2019s rare earths operators and the industry they work in sits at a far more vulnerable evolutionary point.\n\nRare earths is a market so opaque that, as Uren notes, banks and equity markets will not fund prospective producers. And, if the progress of Lynas is any guide, critical financing offered by customer companies or nations will invariably result in offtake agreements that account for much of what is produced.\n\nFor Lynas, of course, that has worked very nicely indeed. It became Japan\u2019s preferred partner after China \u2013 the dominant global supplier - contained rare earths exports in 2010. The result was a deal that continues to deliver very, very low cost financing to Lynas and plenty of quality product to Japanese customers.\n\nRolling the dice\n\nAnd, as Uren noted, Chinese investors have been important in the development of Northern Minerals and long-time investors in Arafura.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the reason why rare earths is such a hot topic right now is that China has, once again, rolled the dice on global supply as part of its trade war with the US in a move which has further armed Donald Trump\u2019s determination to foster alternative sources of supply of rare earths.\n\nAustralia and, very briefly, Greenland have popped up on the President\u2019s radar as potential alternatives and, as a result, there are firm expectations that Ross\u2019 visit will add momentum to plans for a \u201cUS-Australia Critical Minerals Action Plan\u201d.\n\nIt would seem inevitable that translating any sort of plan into productive reality would simply have to address the question of how Australian ambitions might best be funded.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s critical minerals strategy made mention of the potential to use its export finance agency to support the expansion of resource projects to meet international demand, within WTO guidelines,\u201d Uren\u2019s report noted.\n\n\u201cExport Finance Australia includes a \u2018national interest account\u2019, under which the trade minister can direct it to extend loans or offer guarantees in support of an export business. Any losses from such transactions are borne by the Commonwealth, not by Export Finance Australia.\n\n\u201cThe government used that account in 2018 to support its defence equipment export strategy with a total facility of $3.8 billion. It could be used to support sales to US customers, although there is no precedent for it providing the development finance for a start-up project.''", "description": "There is a special case for subsidising a sector, dominated by China, which produces materials essential to the defence industries, writes Matthew Stevens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4682%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_313/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d8e0db28cadf8a77bc6715398db0748df9fffd18", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
