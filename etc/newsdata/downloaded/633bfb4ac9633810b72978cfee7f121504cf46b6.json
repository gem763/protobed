And I have tried, during this period, to find a way out, through which to listen to the voice of the people,\u201d Hariri said.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to have a big shock to face the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cTo all partners in political life, our responsibility today is how we protect Lebanon and revive its economy.\u201d\n\nUnder Lebanon\u2019s constitution, the government will stay on in a caretaker capacity as talks begin on forming a new one. It took nine months to form the Hariri coalition cabinet that took office in January.\n\nAs night fell, protesters returned to central Beirut waving Lebanese flags, seemingly unfazed by the violence.\n\nSome described Hariri\u2019s resignation as a victory for the \u201cOct. 17 uprising\u201d and said the attack on the protest camp had redoubled their determination.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is a point of strength for us\u2026If the thugs come in bigger numbers, so will we,\u201d said Kamal Rida, a protester in central Beirut. \u201cThe tents that are broken can be rebuilt, easy.\u201d\n\nThe turmoil has worsened Lebanon\u2019s acute economic crisis, with financial strains leading to a scarcity of hard currency and a weakening of the pegged Lebanese pound. Lebanese government bonds tumbled on the turmoil.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Saad al-Hariri resigned as Lebanon\u2019s prime minister on Tuesday, declaring he had hit a \u201cdead end\u201d in trying to resolve a crisis unleashed by huge protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Saad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
