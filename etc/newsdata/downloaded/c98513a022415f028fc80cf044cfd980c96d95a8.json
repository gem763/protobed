They have to follow their leadership. And then we\u2019ll get it to the Senate, and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nAt the center of the House\u2019s inquiry is an August whistleblower complaint released last month in which a still-anonymous member of the intelligence community flagged a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nA summary of the July call revealed that Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky to aid lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with a corruption probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The request was based on unfounded allegations, and there remains no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, though Trump has attempted to create suspicion of his political rival ahead of the election.\n\nOn Sunday, Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower\u2019s attorney, confirmed in a tweet that his firm and legal team are now representing multiple whistleblowers connected to the report.", "description": "The former secretary of state is urging members of the GOP to adopt a see-something, say-something approach on Trump's behavior.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a2a0c210000b103aae1d5.jpeg?cache=acn4aaqzot&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
