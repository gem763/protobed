These six manufacturers make up more than 90% share of the market.\n\nData from Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, which together account for about two-thirds of the commercial vehicles market, show that sales of trucks, an indicator of economic activity, fell by almost 40% in August.\n\nWhile crude oil imports are down this year in India, the decline hasn\u2019t been anywhere near as dramatic as for vehicle sales.\n\nIn the first seven months of the year, crude imports were 4.55 million barrels per day (bpd), down 1.3% from the 4.61 million bpd for the same period in 2018, according to data from shipping and industry sources.\n\nFinal figures aren\u2019t yet available for August, but Refinitiv vessel-tracking data suggests that a small increase from July\u2019s imports is likely.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that India\u2019s crude imports are likely to have been somewhat crimped in recent months by the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nU.S. waivers to eight purchasers of Iranian crude, including India, expired at the start of May, resulting in India importing no cargoes from the Islamic Republic in both June and July.\n\nThis is a dramatic shift from 2018, when India\u2019s crude imports from Iran were 611,800 bpd in the first seven months of the year, but only 191,600 bpd in the same period this year.\n\nWhile India has increased imports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United States among others, the disruption from having to cease purchases from Iran may well have made imports lower than they otherwise would have been in recent months.\n\nFUEL DEMAND\n\nIt\u2019s also not the case that Indian refiners have been exporting more refined fuels such as diesel and gasoline, with product exports actually rising in July to 5.07 million tonnes from June\u2019s 4.69 million, although they were down slightly from 5.34 million in July 2018.\n\nDespite the poor vehicle sales, India\u2019s fuel demand also appears to be holding up, with domestic sales rising 3.3% in July to 17.58 million tonnes from the same month a year ago.\n\nThis was the biggest percentage increase since January this year and was led by increases in sales of diesel and gasoline, as well as bitumen.\n\nThe relatively stable crude import and domestic fuel sales data appears to be inconsistent with the weak automotive sector and slowing economic growth, with gross domestic product dropping to a six-year low of 5.0% year-on-year in the second quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that there is a lag between the crashing vehicle sales, slower economic growth and fuel demand, meaning the impact has yet to show up in crude import figures.\n\nThis suggests that one of the engines of global crude oil demand growth is likely to splutter in coming months, a further bearish signal for prices.\n\nHowever, it will also be worth monitoring to see if India\u2019s government acts on calls from the automotive sector for tax cuts in order to stimulate demand.\n\nBut even if the government does act to stimulate demand, it may take some time to work, meaning the risks for India\u2019s crude oil demand are biased to the downside in coming months.", "description": "India's car manufacturers are in deep strife with slumping sales amid a broader slowdown in economic growth, but one element missing in the bearish narrative is a matching drop in crude oil imports.", "authors": ["Clyde Russell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
