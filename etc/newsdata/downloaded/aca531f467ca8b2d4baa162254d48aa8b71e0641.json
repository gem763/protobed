It is hoped the move will attract the brightest degree-holders for subjects in which recruitment is slow, and who might be tempted by high-paying jobs in consultancy, law and accountancy.\n\nThe extended bursaries are also designed to keep new teachers in the classroom amid retention problems across state schools.\n\nThe Department for Education introduced lower maths bursaries last year.\n\nIt is now expanding the scheme to chemistry, physics and modern foreign languages and increasing the payments. From next September, trainee teachers in these four subjects who have a 2.2 degree or higher will receive \u00a326,000 during training.\n\nAn additional \u00a36,000 will be paid across the first four years of their career \u2013 rising to \u00a39,000 for those working in parts of the country with the highest need for teachers amid recruitment challenges.\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \u2018I want the brightest and best talent to be drawn to teaching and for schools to compete with the biggest employers.\u2019", "description": "They will receive staggered payments during training and their early careers in addition to proposed starting salaries of at least \u00a330,000, the Government said yesterday.", "authors": ["Sarah Harris For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/01/19320302-0-image-a-26_1570234781984.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
