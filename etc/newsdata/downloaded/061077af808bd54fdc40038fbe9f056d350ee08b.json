By 2030, UBS estimates it will expand by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% to US$700 billion.\n\nInvestors are intrigued, because this market \u201ctouches something that people obviously relate to multiple times a day, which is food,\u201d Lee says.\n\nThe success of Beyond Meat (ticker: BYND), the maker of plant-based products that went public in May, has proved there can be a commercial angle to alternative foods, but investors also realize the multiple benefits of paying attention to long-term trends.\n\n\u201cThey see [food and agriculture innovation] is one of those trends\u2014it\u2019s not shifting tomorrow, but it\u2019s shifting over time, and it has to shift for reasons of resources, climate, and people,\u201d Lee says.\n\nDriving Forces\n\nIn a report titled \u201cThe Food Revolution,\u201d the wealth manager identifies several trends that will drive innovation in coming decades.\n\nNo. 1 is a growth in population, particularly in Africa\u2014which is expected to add 1 billion people by 2050\u2014coupled by increasing urbanization, particularly throughout Asia. All of this will continue to strain existing land and water resources, and will put pressure on countries to work together.\n\n\u201cThe need for international cooperation to share information, innovation, and technology is more relevant in food production today than in any other industry,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe food industry also is responding to consumers who are more concerned about what they eat\u2014from its cost to the environment to its health benefits, at the same time they want quick access to it at all times. There\u2019s also a push \u201cto bring farming into the future,\u201d through the use of technology. Investment in agricultural-related technology rose to nearly US$17 billion in 2018, up 43% from a year earlier, UBS says.\n\nAgriculture Technology\n\nConsider vertical farming, which employs new technologies in the use of light and water that make it possible for plants to grow even in urban areas.\n\nVertical farming presents \u201can interesting way to reduce a lot of water resource usage, and also improve land usage,\u201d Lee says.\n\nAccording to the report, more types of crops can be grown in these systems. In June 2018, the California firm Crop One Holdings and Dubai-based Emirates Flight Catering partnered to make what is being called the largest vertical farm in the world\u2014a 130,000-square-foot facility that will open in Dubai at the end of this year, UBS said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not complete disruption of the existing\u2014let\u2019s call it the farming industry\u2014but it\u2019s how do you either enhance it or how do you replace it entirely in a way that\u2019s more resource efficient, to produce the same or more amounts of nutrition,\u201d Lee says.\n\nWhere to Invest\n\nThe Crop One-Emirates Flight venture can be considered Farming 4.0, one of five food innovation categories UBS has identified where it expects investors will find opportunities. The other sectors are plant based meat, seed science, and seed treatment, and online food delivery.\n\nThe plant-based meat business is expected to see the fastest growth, rising from US$4.6 billion at a 28% CAGR to US$85 billion by 2030 from US$4.6 billion today.\n\nBut online food delivery will have the biggest footprint in the food innovation category. Driven by increasing demand from young, urban consumers across the globe, online food delivery will expand from a US$49.4 billion business today to US$365 billion business in 2030, UBS said.\n\nMost investment opportunities in these five sectors will be with private companies that are seeking growth capital from friends and family or venture financing. Although understanding the shifts afoot in food and agriculture also will be helpful in gaining insight into how traditional businesses will have to respond.\n\nAs Lee says, \u201csome of the implications of what\u2019s happening here, might not have the most positive effects for traditional companies.\u201d Yet others, whether they are publicly traded or not, are taking steps to respond to the future.\n\nTyson Foods (TSN), for instance, recently invested in New Wave Foods, a company that makes alternative shrimp, and it will be selling vegetable-based chicken nuggets this year.\n\nUBS points out, too, that investors should expect to see plenty of mergers and acquisition activities among food innovation companies in the next three to five years.", "description": "UBS on the trends driving innovation in food and agriculture", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-105839/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
