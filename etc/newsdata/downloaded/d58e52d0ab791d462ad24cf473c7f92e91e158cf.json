It\u2019s called \u201cSafe Abortion (SA)\u201d and it\u2019s free on iOS and Android. In both cases, the developer is listed as Hesperian Health Guides. (I mention this in case copycat apps start popping up; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.)\n\nThe app appears on your home screen with the title \u201cSA\u201d and a pink icon with silhouettes of two women. The app works offline, once you download it, and doesn\u2019t track your queries.\n\nThe idea, developers told Yes magazine, is to provide information on abortion to people in areas where abortion care isn\u2019t straightforward to obtain. That could include countries where it\u2019s illegal, or places like the U.S. where it can be hard to access.\n\nWhen you open the app, the first feature you see is a tool to estimate how far along your pregnancy is. Plug in the date your most recent period began, and the app tells you how many weeks pregnant you are, and which options are safe at that stage.\n\nFor example, if I put in a date seven weeks ago, the app offers me information about abortion with pills (\u201cthis is your best option\u201d) and abortion by suction. If you are more than 20 weeks pregnant, the app doesn\u2019t recommend a method, but says \u201cAs quickly as you can, speak with a medical professional about your options to get a safe abortion.\u201d\n\nEven without using the estimator, you can read through information about three types of abortion (medication, suction, dilation & evacuation), and compare them on measures like pain, cost and failure rate.\n\nThe app doesn\u2019t go as far as recommending particular providers or ways of accessing medication; you\u2019re on your own to actually seek care. But if you\u2019re just looking for a reliable source of information, this app will give you the basics.", "description": "Finding any accurate health information online can be a daunting task these days, and when it comes to abortion, there are anti-abortion groups specifically trying to mislead people who just want information on their own pregnancy and options for ending it....", "authors": ["Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/lwo18vxghrtde6mcacs0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
