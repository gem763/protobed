AP, AP\n\nRudy Giuliani, who did and said all the right things after 9/11, seems now to have lost his way. How did it happen?\n\nOf all the bizarre narratives now cascading from the Trump White House, perhaps the most disturbing and unsettling for anyone from New York or New Jersey who lived through the 9/11 attacks is how much Rudy Giuliani has changed.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Mayor has become America\u2019s Crazy Uncle.\n\nSome of you will surely say that you saw this coming. And maybe you\u2019re right. The signs were definitely there.\n\nDuring his salad days as New York City\u2019s mayor \u2014 and, before that, as a headline-grabbing federal prosecutor who helped to break up the mob \u2014 Giuliani displayed flashes of bellowing anger, infantile petulance, blind selfishness and callous heartlessness.\n\nRemember his press conference to announce his divorce without telling his wife their marriage was over? Yep, that was Rudy in one of his nastiest moments. It almost seemed like the kind of thing that a headline-grabbing New York City developer at the time, Donald Trump, might have done.\n\nRudy Giuliani, an attorney for President Donald Trump, speaks in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 2018. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nLooking back now, some readers are also probably saying that, given what we knew about Giuliani back then, it was only a matter of time before he joined forces with the equally angry, petulant, selfish and heartless President Donald Trump. After all, like minds tend to find each other.\n\nBut those occasional starbursts of weird bluster and scratch-your-head snarky behavior by Giuliani seemed to disappear \u2014 or perhaps were overlooked and forgiven \u2014 in those hard months after the deadly attacks on that Tuesday in September 2001.\n\nThe right man for the moment\n\nIn the smoke-filled, fearsome days that followed the terrorism of September 11, 2001, Giuliani seemed to be everywhere with the right words and tone.\n\nIn the hours after the attacks themselves, as the nation wondered what had really taken place and President George W. Bush was silent as he was shuttled on Air Force One to a locked-down Air Force Base in the Midwest, here was Giuliani, speaking as a sort of modern Greek chorus in voicing the nation\u2019s grief.\n\n\u201cToday is obviously one of the most difficult days in the history of the city,\u201d Giuliani said, only hours after the towers of the World Trade Center toppled in lower Manhattan.\n\n\"The number of casualties,\" he added,\" will be more than any of us can bear ultimately.\u201d\n\nThe words were heartfelt, not heartless. More than other politicians that day, Giuliani captured the sense of despair and tragedy that had suddenly enveloped the nation. No wonder we dubbed him \"America's mayor.\" He was just that.\n\nDon't confuse the two: Giuliani vs. Barr: The point no one is making about Trump's inappropriate Ukraine call\n\nWeeks later, surrounded by New York City firefighters onstage for the opening of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d here was Giuliani telling America it was OK to laugh again.\n\nAnd we laughed. Of course we did. Giuliani seemed to be a man we could trust. He spoke for us.\n\n\u201cThe attacks of September 11 were intended to break our spirit. Instead we have emerged stronger and more unified,\u201d he said months later at the opening of an exhibit of photographs from those attacks. \u201cWe feel renewed devotion to the principles of political, economic and religious freedom, the rule of law and respect for human life. We are more determined than ever to live our lives in freedom.\u201d\n\nFormer New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani arrives on the convention floor during the second day session of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Tuesday, July 19, 2016. (Photo: AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nFast-forward to this year. Now Giuliani is a regular character on \"SNL.\" Once viewed as the nation\u2019s conscience, Giuliani has morphed into a comic foil. No longer depicted as the post-9/11 voice of reason, Giuliani is portrayed by comedian Kate McKinnon as a sleazy nut job who is prone to crazy statements in defense of President Trump.\n\nAnd people laugh this time, too.\n\nThen it all came crashing down\n\nJust as Giuliani\u2019s calming words in the wake of the 9/11 attacks resonated with America, the comic portrayal of his descent into weirdness also resonates. America seems to know a nut when it sees one.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nSurely that is a fair and intriguing question now. Giuliani was never a fool. Nor was he considered stupid.\n\nHe can't argue the facts or the laws: Johnson impeachment expert: Trump lawyer pounds the table in lieu of arguing law or facts\n\nAnd yet, how else to explain him.\n\nA New Yorker article recently theorized that Giuliani, now 75, has \u201clost it mentally\u201d and that historians may come to regard him as a \u201cone-man wrecking crew\u201d for the Trump administration.\n\nIn a recent CNN segment, Giuliani first denied that he asked the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Joe Biden, then quickly reversed himself and admitted that he actually had asked for such an inquiry.\n\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Giuliani chortled, seemingly pleased with himself but also seemingly oblivious that he had just flip flopped on his denial-admission \u2014 a flip-flop that may contribute mightily to the impeachment of his legal client, Donald Trump.\n\nSuch a convoluted style of thinking and speaking should not surprise anyone who has paid attention to Giuliani in recent years as he has grown closer to Trump.\n\nFormer Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and former NY City Mayor Rudy Giuliani at the 911 Commemoration Ceremony honoring and remembering those who died.

(Photo: Chris Pedota/NorthJersey.com)\n\nRemember his pretzel logic on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in August 2018 that \u201ctruth isn\u2019t truth\u201d? Socratic scholars across the globe are still trying to unravel that one.\n\nOr how about this mini temper tantrum recently on Fox News: \u201cShut up, moron. Shut up. Shut up\u201d?\n\nYep, that\u2019s our Rudy. It\u2019s been a long, slow slide in the 18 years since 9/11. In recent days, a satirical advertisement appeared on a New York subway train, mocking Giuliani's legal skills. \"Need a lawyer? Call Crazy Rudy,\" said the ad, which featured a bug-eyed photograph of Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani doesn't fight for us any longer\n\nWhat\u2019s troubling is that it\u2019s not hard to remember that Giuliani\u2019s leadership to curtail crime in New York City and revitalize its dormant economy in the 1990s played a major role in resurrecting the city from its decades-long decline. Giuliani battled the porn hustlers in Times Square, the heroin junkies in Central Park and the oppressive \u201csqueegee men\u201d who wiped your car with dirty rags and demanded your spare change. And mostly he won those battles.\n\nDon't take it personally: Message to evangelicals: Impeachment is about Donald Trump. It's not an attack on you.\n\nUnder Giuliani, New York began to shed its reputation as a vortex of dysfunction. The city is hardly perfect now. But anyone who remembers the city of a quarter-century ago has to admit that New York has changed in ways that many back then never thought possible.\n\nWorth remembering is that Giuliani was hardly perfect back then, either. During his eight years as New York\u2019s mayor, which ended in 2001, Giuliani slipped into moments of cartoon-like calamity. Sometimes his ego seemed as massive as Manhattan. Sometimes his statements on race and poverty seemed unkind. But few doubted his mental makeup.\n\nNow that\u2019s changed.\n\nIn the days after the 9/11 attacks, Giuliani was introduced by Oprah Winfrey during a prayer service at Yankee Stadium as the \u201cman of the hour, a man whose extraordinary grace under pressure in the days since this devastating attack has led him to be called America's mayor.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani is no longer a man of grace.\n\nHe\u2019s the mayor who fell from grace.\n\nMike Kelly is a columnist for the North Jersey Record, where this column originally appeared.
