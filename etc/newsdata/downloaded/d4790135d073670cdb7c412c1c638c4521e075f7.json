He joined Washington in 2010, overseeing a number of high-profile controversies from the conflict between Mike Shanahan and Robert Griffin III, the firing of former general manager Scot McCloughan and the signing of linebacker Reuben Foster in light of a domestic violence arrest.\n\nWyllie\u2019s signature moment, however, is arguably a confrontation with a reporter after the Redskins\u2019 win on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in 2014 when he yelled \u201cNo means no!\u201dand pulled Colt McCoy away from an interview.\n\nWyllie\u2019s departure is the latest exit within the Redskins\u2019 organization. They\u2019ve had at least 40 employees leave the team since president of business operations Brian Lafemina was fired in December, eight months after being hired.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
