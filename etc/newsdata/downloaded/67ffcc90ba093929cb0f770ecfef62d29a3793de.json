I knew Moussa would be ready.\"\n\nAsked whether Kante would play against Turkey, Deschamps said: \"I do not think it\u2019s too serious for NG [Kante], but I do not have an answer tonight.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nLampard had been in dialogue with France boss Didier Deschamps over the selection of Kante for the world champions' squad, which led to the former Leicester midfielder missing France's matches against Albania and Andorra in September's international break.\n\nDeschamps - himself a former Chelsea player - spoke about his conversations with Lampard when he announced his squad earlier this month, and took a little dig at the former England midfielder over his team selection .\n\n\"Lampard had asked me not to pick Kante at the last break,\" he told a press conference.\n\n\"If that's still the way I'm going to call him later to tell him it would be nice if you play Olivier Giroud a little bit!\"", "description": "Heach coach says midfielder was pulled from starting XI as a precaution, while Frank Lampard has told France camp about concerns over his fitness", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562993.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-FRA-EURO2020-TRAINING.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
