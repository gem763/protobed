With that height, the serve is a huge weapon and huge advantage.\n\n\u201cI managed to read his serve and find a good position on the return at the end of the first set and also (at the) beginning of the second... I thought it was one of the best serving matches I had lately.\u201d\n\nDjokovic, the defending champion, will next play Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas who beat Poland\u2019s Hubert Hurkacz 7-5 3-6 7-6(5) in the only three-setter of the day.\n\nTwice champion Roger Federer was far from his best but did enough to overcome David Goffin 7-6(7) 6-4. Federer committed 40 unforced errors but saved five set points in the opening set.\n\n\u201cI never really felt like I had the upper hand over David today, I thought he did a really good job. He was so much better than at the U.S. Open,\u201d Federer said of his Belgian opponent who he beat in straight sets in last month\u2019s Grand Slam.\n\n\u201cI think he was very clear in his shot selection... He was super fast on his feet today which made it really hard for me to get my freebies and winners off the baseline because he was getting to all of them.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss second seed will be up against German fifth seed Alexander Zverev, who dispatched Andrey Rublev 6-0 7-6(4) in 84 minutes.\n\nThird-seed Daniil Medvedev also advanced with a 7-6(7) 7-5 victory over Canadian Vasek Pospisil while fourth-seed Dominic Thiem recorded a straightforward 6-3 6-4 win over Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili.", "description": "World number one Novak Djokovic produced a majestic display in a 7-5 6-3 victory over American John Isner on Thursday to extend his winning streak in Asia and reach the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439323487&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991M3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
