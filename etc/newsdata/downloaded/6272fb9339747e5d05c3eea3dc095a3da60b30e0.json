The bridesmaid told police her friend immediately started screaming at Mr Carney.\n\nThe bride followed him into the parking lot and the two got into a physical fight, according to court records.\n\nAnother bridesmaid helped the woman walk out of the showers, the Morning Call reported.\n\nThe next morning, Mr Carney called the bridesmaid to apologise, but claimed he didn\u2019t know what they had done the night before, according to the police report.\n\nOn the morning of the wedding, he texted again to ask the woman to put on a good face for the wedding and to pressure her to take the morning after pill to prevent an accidental pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI wanted to apologise again for everything,\u201d he wrote in a lengthy message, according to the probable cause affidavit.\n\n\u201cCan we please just be as happy as possible for [the bride] today? Mistakes are behind us and I just need total closure before I do this [that is] why I\u2019m sending this.", "description": "Two days before his wedding, the groom spent the afternoon floating down the Delaware River in eastern Pennsylvania with his wedding party.Groomsmen and bridesmaids passed around beers and shots of vodka as they guided paddle boards and rafts downstream.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LxgBjomCjN.z3ub1Blf6Dw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1d415e43ef1f9ab8532da8f762a962db", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
