Multiple free throws will be taken in the last 2 minutes of regulation or in overtime.\n\nThe change is being made in part to study if game length gets shorter.\n\nRule changes are often added to the G League in an effort to get real data and feedback before they are considered for implementation at the NBA level. Other past examples are the 14-second shot clock reset on offensive rebounds and the coach\u2019s challenge, both of which were in the G League before making the NBA rulebook.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NBA says most two- and three-shot fouls in the G League this season will be settled by taking just one free throw.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
