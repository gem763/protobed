USA TODAY\n\nLance McCullers Jr. will not pitch in this World Series as he rehabs from Tommy John surgery.\n\nThe Houston Astros pitcher will, however, make sure three Astros fans attend a World Series game \u2014 in peace.\n\nA trio of Astros fans told ABC 13 in Houston they were heckled and had beer and food thrown at them during Game 5 of the ALCS in New York. Yankees security eventually escorted them to a location behind home plate to watch the rest of the game, they said.\n\n\"We thought we were going to be removed from the stadium, but some other New York fans told them we'd done nothing wrong,\" Nathan Rocha, one of the Astros fans, told ABC 13.\n\nMcCullers Jr. learned of their experience on social media and reached out to one member of the crew, Cruz Arcia Jr.\n\n'YOU NEED TO GO PAY PEOPLE': Nationals, Astros show power of almighty dollar in World Series\n\n'We have to keep going': Bryce Harper gone but not forgotten as Nationals bask in World Series\n\nThis Astros fan had to be escorted from his seat after getting beer and popcorn thrown in his face\n\n\n\n(via mhjay_/Instagram) pic.twitter.com/Zj438VT6pP \u2014 Bleacher Report MLB (@BR_MLB) October 19, 2019\n\n\"Fans of all teams should be celebrated for loving the game, not treated like that,\" McCullers Jr told Arcia Jr. on Twitter. \"I look forward to having you watch a WS game in the H on me.\"\n\nThe unruliness of some Yankees fans was well-documented during the series.
