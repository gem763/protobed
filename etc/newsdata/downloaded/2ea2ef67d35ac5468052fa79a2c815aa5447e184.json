Ted Cruz and actress Alyssa Milano will try to table their differences as they come together to talk gun reform.\n\nCHICAGO MAYOR CLASHES WITH CRUZ OVER GUN VIOLENCE: 'KEEP OUR NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH'\n\nAfter last weekend's fatal gun spree in Odessa, Milano criticized Matt Schaefer, a Texas Republican lawmaker, who insisted that any gun control measures put in place wouldn't stop a person of \u201cevil intent.\u201d\n\nHe further declared on Twitter that \"I am NOT going to use the evil acts of a handful of people to diminish the God-given rights of my fellow Texans. Period.\".\n\nTo that, Milano asked: \u201cCan someone cite which passage of the Bible God states it is a god-given right to own a gun? This guy is unbelievable and is clearly owned by the gun lobby.\u201d\n\nCruz then replied to the human rights activist that \u201cit is of course not the right to a modern-day firearm that is God-given but rather the right to Life & the right to Liberty. Essential to that right is the right to DEFEND your life & your family.\u201d\n\nTRUMP 2020 PRESS SECRETARY: ALYSSA MILANO 'DOESN'T MATTER'\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t agree on this issue. But if we can talk with mutual respect & humility, maybe all of is come together to effect positive change,\u201d she wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening.\n\nAlthough details surrounding the meeting have yet to be announced, Milano tweeted in a response to Cruz on Monday that she would be traveling to Washington next week and hoped to live-stream the conversation \u201cso the American people can hear your bulls--- 1st hand.\u201d\n\nCruz responded to the \u201cCharmed\u201d alum\u2019s proposal:\n\nALYSSA MILANO SAYS SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT 2 ABORTIONS: 'I WOULD NOT HAVE MY CAREER'\n\n\"I\u2019d be happy to sit down & visit next week about uniting to stop gun violence & about the Constitution,\" Cruz wrote. \"If we can have a civil & positive conversation -- in the spirit of 1 Peter 4:8 as you suggest -- despite our political differences, that might help resolve the discord in our Nation.\"\n\nMilano has ramped up her political involvement in recent years. In July, she tweeted that she was \"feeling hopeless\" thanks to perceived inaction by the Republican Party on hot-button issues.\n\n\u201cI keep getting DM\u2019s asking me if I\u2019m ok,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTruth is...I\u2019m feeling hopeless.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe continued: \u201cMass shootings.Corruption.Lies. Racism.Xenophobia.Crimes Against Humanity.\n\nAnd the Republican Party is not standing up to the tyranny.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy, Joseph A.
