Over four years, he never wavered from recommending the stock, and this summer the analyst predicted the streaming giant would eventually be worth more than $200 billion.\n\nBut in September, Wlodarczak slashed his price target by a third to $350 \u2014 the largest cut since he began coverage. While he still recommends the stock, Wlodarczak is part of a growing chorus of analysts who now worry Netflix is headed for a slowdown. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG were among the latest to cut their expectations Thursday.\n\n\u201cSentiment is awful,\u201d Wlodarczak said.\n\nNetflix shares have fallen 23% since mid-July, when the company fell short of its own second-quarter forecast for new customers. While most analysts blamed the miss on a recent price increase, they also worry that looming competition from Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., Apple Inc. and AT&T Inc. could make it difficult for the company to sustain its growth \u2014 or reduce the billions of dollars it must raise annually in the junk-bond market.\n\nThat raises the pressure on Netflix investors ahead of next week, when the company reports third-quarter results, the final stretch before the Disney+ and Apple TV+ streaming services debut. The Los Gatos, California-based company predicted in July it would add 7 million customers in the period, bringing its worldwide total to almost 159 million. But data services used by investors project Netflix will sign fewer, Wlodarczak said.\n\n\u201cPeople are expecting them to miss,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t recall Netflix ever missing two quarters in a row.\u201d\n\nThat growing apprehension marks a stark turnaround for a company that has seemed invincible for years, often obliterating Wall Street\u2019s estimates as consumers across the world embraced internet TV. Investor enthusiasm helped fuel Netflix\u2019s rise to the top of the global-entertainment business and feed its ever-growing cash needs.\n\nWhen the company\u2019s first original hit drama, \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d debuted in 2013, Netflix was worth around $10 billion, a fraction of the value placed on media giants like Disney and Comcast.\n\nThe success of its early series and the decline in pay-TV customers convinced investors that Netflix was reigning over a new era of TV, where people in developed countries watched on-demand over the internet instead of via cable or satellite.\n\nSubscribers surpassed 50 million, and then 100 million. The market value of Netflix soared as well, peaking near $170 billion last year and briefly topping Disney\u2019s.\n\nBut Netflix\u2019s spending on movies and TV shows also soared \u2014 to an estimated $15 billion this year \u2014 while the number of projects topped 1,000. The company\u2019s debt ballooned too, from $500 million to roughly $13 billion.\n\nNow, more than two decades after its founding, Netflix is still burning through cash and earning less than its media peers.\n\nThe company blamed the second-quarter misfire on its slate of new films and TV shows, a claim that set off alarms inside and outside the company. Netflix released dozens of new projects in the second quarter, including the award-winners \u201cOur Planet\u201d and \u201cWhen They See Us,\u201d the Adam Sandler comedy \u201cMurder Mystery\u201d and the breakout hit \u201cDead to Me.\u201d\n\nIf all those programs failed to deliver, what would?\n\nSome employees also questioned why the company went ahead with a long-planned retreat to Iceland just days before delivering such bad news, according to a person familiar with the matter. Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos have since reassured employees that the second quarter was a hiccup, according to some who were privy to the conversations and asked not to be identified because they were private.\n\nFor the quarter just ended, new seasons of hits such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cLa Casa de Papel\u201d probably helped the company attract new customers. If Netflix hits its forecast when results come out next week, it\u2019ll be a record for the quarter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money being spent, and Netflix will have to ramp up.\u201d\n\nBut employees and investors clearly worry this time is different. Netflix has a lot more customers than it did three years ago, making it harder to sustain the same level of growth. And that\u2019s without new competition.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Jeff Wlodarczak has been one of Netflix Inc.\u2019s biggest advocates on Wall Street since he took over coverage of the company at Pivotal Research Group in 2015.
