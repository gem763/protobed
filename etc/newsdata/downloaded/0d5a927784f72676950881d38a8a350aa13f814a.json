The big question is, in which order?\n\nNot long ago the All Blacks would have been clear favorites but an underwhelming Rugby Championship saw them lose their No. 1 ranking and, more crucially, some of their aura.\n\nThe Springboks, after a slump from 2016-2018, have been growing in confidence since Rassie Erasmus took over as coach and won the southern hemisphere title for the first time in 10 years this season.\n\nThe last four games between the All Blacks and Springboks have been decided by two points or less - the most recent was a 16-16 draw. Whoever wins in Yokohama on the second day of the World Cup will take huge momentum.\n\nItaly, Namibia and Canada are the other teams in the group and they all face an uphill task to qualify ahead of the big two.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at Pool B:\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n\nCoach: Steve Hansen\n\nCaptain: Kieran Read\n\nBest RWC Performance: Champion: 1987, 2011 and \u201815.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-W, \u201811-W, \u201807-QF, \u201803-3rd, 1999-4th.\n\nOutlook: Although New Zealand underperformed in the Rugby Championship, its last two results before the World Cup were compelling: 36-0 over Australia and 92-7 over Tonga. The squad has world-class depth in every position and maybe finishing third in the Rugby Championship was the wake-up call needed to focus minds on the World Cup defense. The All Blacks are still the favorites in Japan.\n\nPlayers to watch: Richie Mo\u2019unga appears to be Hansen\u2019s choice for the No. 10 jersey ahead of Beauden Barrett but both playmakers are key to the All Blacks\u2019 chances of winning three titles in a row - no team had successfully defended the World Cup before New Zealand did it four years ago. Hansen thinks the duel playmaker tactic, with Mo\u2019unga at flyhalf and Barrett switched to fullback, will get the best out of both of them: Mo\u2019unga\u2019s tactical kicking and link play and Barrett\u2019s eye for a gap and blistering speed. Brodie Retallick is arguably the best lock in the world and the All Blacks will be desperate for him to recover fully from a shoulder injury.\n\n___\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\n\nCoach: Rassie Erasmus\n\nCaptain: Siya Kolisi\n\nBest RWC Performance: Champion: 1995 and 2007.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-3rd, \u201811-QF, \u201807-W, \u201803-QF; 1999-3rd.\n\nOutlook: Erasmus holds the secret for South Africa and has turned the Boks around in the space of a year. South Africa plummeted to new depths under former coach Allister Coetzee, including a 57-0 humiliation by the All Blacks in 2017. Erasmus took the team to victory in New Zealand a year later. Erasmus has the advantage of also being the South African rugby union\u2019s director of rugby, giving him the latitude to make unconventional decisions. In the Rugby Championship, he split the players into two squads and left one at home to play Australia while a group of frontline players were given a week off to rest and acclimatize in New Zealand before the next game. It worked, with South Africa going on to win the tournament and also resting senior players ahead of the World Cup.\n\nPlayers to watch: Lock-turned-flanker Pieter-Steph du Toit seems to have no weakness. He carries the ball strongly and makes mountains of tackles each game. His stamina is surprising for a man who is 6-foot-6 and 120 kilograms. Handre Pollard calls the shots for the Springboks from flyhalf. Scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies will likely start on the bench but has a knack for scoring tries; two on his debut against Australia in July and a match-saving last-minute try in his second test against New Zealand.\n\n___\n\nITALY\n\nCoach: Conor O\u2019Shea\n\nCaptain: Sergio Parisse\n\nBest RWC Performance: 2007: won two pool matches (vs. Portugal, Romania) and narrowly lost 18-16 to Scotland to miss out on the quarterfinals.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-Group, \u201811-Group, \u201807-Group, \u201803-Group, 1999-Group.\n\nOutlook: Italy has placed last in the last four Six Nations tournaments without winning a game and has just one win in nine tests this year - against Russia. The Azzurri should see off Namibia and Canada but beating New Zealand and South Africa appears out of reach, as do the quarterfinals once again.\n\nPlayers to watch: Captain Sergio Parisse is the third most capped player of all time behind Richie McCaw and Brian O\u2019Driscoll but it\u2019ll take more than just the No. 8\u2019s 140 tests of experience to get Italy to the quarterfinals for the first time. Parisse will need help up front from fellow loose forward Braam Steyn, who was born in South Africa, and lock Dean Budd, born in New Zealand. Both are set to play against their countries of birth. Utility back Edoardo Padovani scored tries in each of Italy\u2019s first three games in this year\u2019s Six Nations.\n\n___\n\nNAMIBIA\n\nCoach: Phil Davies\n\nCaptain: Johan Deysel\n\nBest RWC Performance: 2015: Came within a point (16-17) of beating Georgia and registering first RWC win.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-Group, \u201811-Group, \u201807-Group, \u201803-Group, 1999-Group.\n\nOutlook: Former Wales international Davies first took charge of Namibia in the months before the last World Cup and there was marked improvement, with Namibia putting in a brave performance against Tonga and just missing out on an historic win over Georgia. The Namibians will likely be targeting the Canada game as their best chance of claiming the victory that has eluded them at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nPlayers to watch: Harlequins loose forward Renaldo Bothma was meant to captain Namibia at the World Cup but retired from internationals days before the squad was announced, leaving center Deysel to take over. Hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld, a barreling frontrower who loves to run with ball in hand, has played Super Rugby in South Africa. Scrumhalf Eugene Jantjies will be playing in his fourth World Cup.\n\n____\n\nCANADA\n\nCoach: Kingsley Jones\n\nCaptain: Tyler Ardron\n\nBest RWC Performance: Quarterfinals: 1991.\n\nLast 5 RWCs: 2015-Group, \u201811-Group, \u201807-Group, \u201803-Group, 1999-Group.\n\nOutlook: Canada was the last team to qualify for the World Cup, coming through in the repechage playoffs ahead of Germany, Hong Kong and Kenya. The mere fact Canada had to go through that indicates the team\u2019s slide since it beat Fiji and Romania and pushed France close to make the quarterfinals in 1991. That year, the Canadians were even competitive in a 24-13 loss to defending champion New Zealand in the quarters. The meeting with the All Blacks in Japan is unlikely to be as close and coach Jones\u2019 Canada will probably be fighting with fellow Welshman Davies\u2019 Namibia to avoid last in the group.\n\nPlayers to watch: Loose forward Ardron is clearly Canada\u2019s best player, good enough to be signed by New Zealand Super Rugby team the Chiefs last year. Canada\u2019s other source of inspiration is veteran winger DTH van der Merwe, the country\u2019s record try-scorer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Defending champion New Zealand and archrival South Africa meet in the opening game to ensure a fascinating start to Rugby World Cup Pool B.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/aptopix_new_zealand_tonga_rugby_79043_c0-120-3600-2218_s1770x1032.jpg?3d4418892aeca941ac90b2a0a958981728f26c1d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
