Running until the 18th of March, the show gives car manufacturers the chance to showcase their latest models and concepts, with Croatia\u2019s Rimac electric hypercar stealing a lot of attention with its 412km/h top speed and 1.97 0-100km/h time.\n\nAny company today, especially in the automotive world, can't ignore electrification. Jonathan Wells Head of Design at Morgan Motors\n\nFans of internal combustion powered supercars are also spoilt for choice, with a new Bugatti revealed for those who have a cool \u20ac2.65 million in the bank and the desire to spend it.\n\nPorsche has something a little more affordable on offer. Prices start at almost \u20ac200,000 for their 911 GT3 RS, one of the most photographed and blogged cars at the event. The Geneva show version would be tricky to lose in the car park as it\u2019s so bright, but one suspects it\u2019s possible to change the colour.\n\nMorgan are making an electric car for the first time ever. The firm\u2019s 1930s design cues are intact in the EV3, which features brass switches and a bakelite drive selector, albeit with an internal electric reboot for a trending market. Jonathan Wells, the head of design at Morgan Motors explained the decision:\n\n\u201cAny company today, especially in the automotive world, can\u2019t ignore electrification. It\u2019s happening at a global scale, we need to think about what we\u2019re doing to our planet obviously. So it\u2019s something very important for Morgan to consider\u201d.\n\nRenault came to Geneva with some of its petrolhead pleasing RS models but also a large \u2018mobility concept\u2019 called the EZ-Go. Laurent Van Den Acker, the Senior Vice President of Corporate Design at Groupe Renualt, explained the idea to Euronews: \u201cThe Renault EZ-Go is our vision for urban mobility of the future, which is a service, it\u2019s a shared vehicle. It\u2019s a shared vehicle that you don\u2019t own anymore, it is driverless, no steering wheel, and it can actually find its way itself through the city, through an app.\u201d\n\nItalian design house Icona had an even more upmarket autonomous vehicle on its stand, with an interior with seating for six and the quality materials one would associate with a luxury yacht or jet. VW was another of the firms to present electric and autonomous concepts to the crowds, with a concept called I.D. Vizzion, that even incorporates artificial intelligence to learn about a driver\u2019s habits.\n\nGeneva has a special place in the car-lover\u2019s heart, because it features some of the smaller German and Italian performance brands and tuners that are seldom seen at other shows, such as Ruf and Touring of Milan.\n\nIt has a special place in the heart of car salesmen too, because of the wealthy locals and visitors. So does anyone actually buy a car here? Euronews put that question to Alpine, the newly relaunched French sports car maker whose A110 was surrounded by crowds. \u201cWe do sell cars here, absolutely,\u201d said Design Director Antony Villain. \u201cThere are lots of customers at Geneva, lots of customers for sports cars.\u201d", "description": "The Rimac hypercar, Jaguar I-PACE and Morgan EV3 showcase the electric trend at the Geneva International Motor Show", "authors": ["Jonathan Wells"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/441477/1000x563_441477.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-09"}
