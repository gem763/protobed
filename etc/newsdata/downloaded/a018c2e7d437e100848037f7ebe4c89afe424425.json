Teitler told People. \u201cOur client will make no further statements.\u201d\n\nFORMER 'TODAY' ANCHOR MATT LAUER MAKES APPEARANCE DANCING IN DAUGHTER'S TIKTOK VIDEOS\n\nThe couple is parents to sons Thijs, 12, and Jack, 18, and daughter Romy, 16.\n\nThe former \"Today\" show host, 61, and the former model, 52, were married for more than 20 years but split two years ago after Lauer's career was upended by sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nA Suffolk County Supreme Court judge signed the divorce papers in September, court spokesman Lucian Chalfen confirmed to Fox News, after Roque filed for divorce in July.\n\nLauer, who was fired from NBC News for sexual misconduct in 2017, is accused of new sex crimes in graphic detail by Variety, which reported that the bombshell claims would be included in Farrow\u2019s upcoming book.\n\nThe outlet reports Lauer anally raped an NBC News colleague, Brooke Nevils, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia while she claims she was intoxicated.\n\n'DIFF'RENT STROKES' ACTOR DANNY COOKSEY'S ESTRANGED WIFE GETS RESTRAINING ORDER AFTER JEALOUS BEHAVIOR: REPORT\n\n\"In response to your inquiry, our client has asked us to tell you that now that the parties are officially divorced, her priority and only concern is for their wonderful children.\" \u2014 Annette Roque's lawyer, John M. Teitler\n\nLauer denied the graphic rape claim in a strongly worded letter via his lawyer on Wednesday, in which the former \u201cToday\u201d co-host said he was initially quiet for the sake of his children -- but will now defend himself.\n\n\u201cIt is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault. It is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense,\u201d Lauer wrote.\n\n\u201cI had an extramarital affair with [a colleague] in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts... each act was mutual and completely consensual,\u201d Lauer added.\n\nMATT LAUER AGREES TO PAY ANNETTE ROQUE UP TO $20M IN DIVORCE\n\nNevils, 35, excoriated Lauer in a letter to NBC News, calling Lauer's written denial of her allegations \"a case study in victim blaming.\"\n\n\"There's the Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades, and there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,\" Nevins wrote, in part, according to NBC News. \"His open letter was a case study in victim blaming. \u2026 I am not afraid of him now, regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would (and now has) tried to use against me.\u201d\n\nNBC News addressed the new claims by reading a statement on air.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague,\u201d the statement read.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "Matt Lauer\u2019s ex-wife, Annette Roque spoke out for the first time since allegations of sexual assault were first brought up against the now-disgraced TV anchor.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy", "Annette Roque'S Lawyer", "John M.
