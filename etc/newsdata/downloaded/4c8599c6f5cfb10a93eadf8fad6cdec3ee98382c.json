All of this could have been avoided if I just checked the photo after taken it and seeing my passport lying there on the floor!\n\n'Even though I had so much bad luck happen this holiday, I had the best time and I will never forget this situation!'\n\nThe lost passport wasn't the first disaster of Ms Cook's holiday. Her trip - booked with Love Holidays - had been cancelled just two days before she was due to fly with Thomas Cook on September 25.\n\nMs Cook (pictured) was forced to stay in Ibiza for four extra nights due to the missing passport and issues with her flight\n\nThe Briton, who was travelling with her friend Becca, had scrambled to book last minute flights and hotels - but the pair ended up missing their connecting flight due to plane delays.\n\n'Me and Becca booked our holiday with Love Holidays and we were flying with Thomas Cook', she said.\n\n'Just two days before we were supposed to go they sent me an email telling us that they had cancelled our holiday and they will send over refund.\n\n'I had to get a whole new hotel and flights package like a day before Ibiza and the package we found didn't have a direct flight so we had to get off at Barcelona!\n\n'And because the plane from Gatwick to Barcelona was delayed for hour and half we missed our flight from Barcelona to Ibiza.\n\n'So we told the airline we was flying with that it wasn't our fault and they put us on the next plane but that was five hours later! We had to wait in the airport for five hours more! How unlucky did we get!'\n\nAfter arriving on the Spanish island, disaster struck when Ms Cook and her friends went to a club called Pacha for music event - and she realised her passport was missing.\n\nIn a state of panic, she began rummaging through her bag and searching everywhere, but it was nowhere to be found.\n\nMs Cook said: 'On the second night we went to a club called Pacha to see an event called \"Music On.\" We were both having such a good time, we even met these girls there that we bumped into at the airport.\n\nAhead of losing her passport in Ibiza, Ms Cook (right) had missed her connecting flight in Barcelona due to delays at Gatwick\n\nThe Brit was stranded in Ibiza while the British consulate processed her emergency passport\n\n'As the night went on I kept checking my bag and I told Becca I can't find my passport but she kept telling me it's probably at home.\n\n'I kept retracting my steps and checking the toilets, lost property, asking behind the bar and looking around that exact spot where we was taking photos and I couldn't find it at all!\n\n'I probably spend most of my night trying to find it. Becca kept telling me it's probably back at the hotel so there's no point in worrying but all I could think about was how was I supposed to get home. I leave in four days!'\n\nMs Cook applied for an emergency passport on Friday, but had to wait another four days because the British consulate did not process documents on weekends - meaning she would miss her return flight on Monday.\n\nShe said: 'The next day I filled out an online application for an emergency passport and then I rung the office up to ask when it will be ready. The woman told me I will be missing my flight on Monday because the passport takes two working days to come.\n\n'I was so scared I didn't know how I was gonna manage on my own! Becca wanted to stay with me but she couldn't because it was vital she went home for work as she had too much time off already.\n\n'Luckily one of my others friends I knew from back home said she she would stay out there with me which was a huge weight lifted from my shoulders, at least I knew she was gonna help me. I would have been useless on my own.\n\nThe unlucky tourist was then forced to stay another two nights after she was told there was a payment issue on her ticket when she tried to check in for her rescheduled flight\n\nThe bemused Brit posted about her ordeal on Twitter after she found her passport in the photo\n\n'I continued to stay out in Ibiza enjoying myself until Tuesday night, we changed hotels from San Antonio to Platja d'en Bossa and we booked the flights for Tuesday night, annoyingly they cost another \u00a3340 each!'\n\nDespite having an extended stay in Ibiza, Ms Cook was more than prepared to head home on Tuesday night when another ordeal struck.\n\nMs Cook was checking in at the airport when staff told her there was a payment issue on her ticket, meaning she was unable to board the aircraft.\n\nShe said: 'When we tried to check in one of the ladies from easyJet said there had been a payment issue and that we couldn't get on our flights. We felt hopeless. We just wanted to go home.\n\n'We tried asking if we could repay to get on the flights and they said it was fully booked and there were no flights until Friday.\n\n'We were panicking to say the least. Luckily easyJet refunded us, but we had to go all the way back to Bossa and check into another hotel.\n\n'We didn't really go out partying much as all we wanted to do was just go home now.\n\n'On the Wednesday we did go out and had a really good time despite being stranded in Ibiza for an extra four nights.'", "description": "Bobbie Cook, 21, from Essex, had already faced flight cancellations and delays when she misplaced the document during a week-long trip to the\u00a0Spanish island last month.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/19728960-0-image-a-23_1571125828547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
