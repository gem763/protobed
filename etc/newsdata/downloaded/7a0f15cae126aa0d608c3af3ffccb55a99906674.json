Katie Hill.\n\nPapadopoulos will formally announce his run on Thursday, a general campaign consultant told Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\n\nThis past Sunday, Papadopoulos tweeted: \u201cI love my state too much to see it run down by candidates like Hill. All talk, no action, and a bunch of sellouts.\u201d Then, on Monday: \"Announcement soon on my interest in Katie Hill\u2019s soon to be vacant seat in the 25th district!\"\n\nHill, whose district covers Los Angeles County, announced her resignation Sunday amid an ethics probe into allegations she had an inappropriate relationship with a congressional staffer and the emergence of embarrassing personal photos.\n\nWHEW! MSNBC FINALLY DECIDES TO COVER KATIE HILL SCANDAL\n\nShe\u2019s admitted to a consensual relationship with a campaign staff member, but denied one with her legislative director, which would violate U.S. House rules. She\u2019s also called herself the victim of revenge porn by an abusive husband she's divorcing.\n\nHill has also said the right-wing media took her down.\n\nPapadopoulos was a key figure in the FBI\u2019s Russia probe into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. That investigation began after revelations that Papadopoulos had learned in 2016 from Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.\n\nHe then used that connection to try to set up a meeting between President Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlthough Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe has concluded, Papadopoulos has remained in the headlines. A source in the Italian Ministry of Justice told The Daily Beast earlier this month that Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, who are investigating possible FBI and DOJ misconduct during the Russia probe, were played a taped deposition made by Mifsud.\n\nMifsud reportedly was explaining to investigators in the deposition why people would want to harm him, and why he needed police protection. Papadopoulos has suggested he was connected with Mifsud as part of a setup orchestrated by intelligence agencies.\n\nIn July, Papadopoulos told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive interview that he was heading back to Greece to retrieve $10,000 that he suspects was dropped in his lap as part of an entrapment scheme by the CIA or FBI -- and federal investigators want to see the marked bills, which he said are now stored in a safe.\n\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and cooperated in Mueller\u2019s investigation. He was sentenced in fall 2018 to 14 days in prison.\n\nHe enters a field of at least three other Republicans and one Democrat. The other Republicans are Navy veteran Mike Garcia, bank executive Angela Jacobs Underwood and Mark Cripe, who works for the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Former Republican Rep. Steve Knight, who lost the seat to Hill in 2018, is also considering running.\n\nThe seat was the last Los Angeles County seat to be held by Republicans before Hill\u2019s victory and was one of seven Democrats flipped last year.\n\nState Assemblywoman Christy Smith is the only Democrat in the race so far. She quickly criticized Papadopoulos on Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIf he pled guilty to lying to the FBI -- how do we know he\u2019ll tell us the truth?\u201d Smith tweeted. \u201cWe deserve someone from our community serving as our voice -- not (Trump\u2019s) wannabe political hack!\u201d\n\n\"The Ingraham Angle\" producer Ali Holston and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide who has alleged he was targeted\u00a0in FBI\u2019s Russia probe as part of a scheme to take down his boss,\u00a0filed paperwork Tuesday to run for the U.S. House seat being vacated by Democrat Katie Hill.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
