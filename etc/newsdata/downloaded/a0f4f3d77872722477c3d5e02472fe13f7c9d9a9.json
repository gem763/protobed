It is the end of the season and all the races and travel have begun to take their toll.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the end of the season it\u2019s more mental than physical,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year, by the last races I was mentally checked out. I\u2019m more aware of it now. I know it\u2019s not physical so being aware of it will help hopefully.\u201d\n\nThe GTS takes place over sevens races, mostly in Europe with one in the US. After six races, the top 10 men and women are invited to the final in Nepal. Croft won the Marathon du Mont Blanc, finished second in the 22km Dolomyths race and fourth in the 31km Sierre-Zinal.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s in a series, I still approach every race the same. Every race is so different, you can\u2019t look at the series as one overall thing. You have to approach each race and treat it how it is,\u201d Croft said. \u201cThe goal was to get to the final.\u201d\n\nCroft has had another impressive season, finishing second in the Trail World Championships earlier in the summer and winning the OCC at the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc week in August. But she has to base herself in Europe to travel to races and took a trip home for a family wedding just before the OCC (Orsi\u00e8res-Champex-Chamonix).\n\n\u201cAfter coming back from New Zealand, it really took a lot out of me,\u201d she said. \u201cEven being based in Europe for six months, it\u2019s still not home, I\u2019m moving around a lot and not grounded.\u201d\n\nShe still has The North Face race on the horizon and then will travel home for some rest and recovery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot different for athletes based in Europe as they go to races and back to normality,\u201d Croft said. \u201cBut it\u2019s [being in Europe for six months] the only way I can make it work. I feel like I\u2019m always in running mode. But at home, you have your community and friends who don\u2019t care about running.\u201d\n\nTo deal with the hectic lifestyle, Croft has done a multi-day silent meditation retreat. Once she has completed her season she intends to take part in a retreat again before heading home.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m slipping back into old habits. Just like thought patterns,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to have a refresher.\u201d", "description": "The OCC winner is in Nepal for the 42km GTS finale, but as the season wears on she knows she has to stay mentally sharp to compete with the best", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/24/c9e84d84-f57c-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_142353.jpg?itok=AGaniEkx&v=1571898242", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
