I remember him having correspondence from a doctor or professor who was trying to link footballers with dementia and mental problems. Jimmy was very concerned.\u201d\n\nIn fact records of doctors blaming brain injuries on heading the ball can be traced back at least 80 years.\n\nIn 1939, former Man United captain Charlie Roberts told the Mirror he was having surgery to remove \u201ca growth at the back of my skull which has developed as a result of heading heavy balls so often over 20 years ago\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI have been almost like the living dead for the last two years.\u201d\n\nCharlie never recovered from the operation and died days later, aged 56.\n\nThe former player\u2019s death certificate listed the tumour and the brain surgery as the causes of his death.\n\nThis week research revealed footballers are three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementia and are at greater risk of other conditions such as motor neurone disease.\n\nThe research, funded by the PFA and the FA, looked at pro footballers who were born between 1900 and 1976.\n\nThe study was set up two years ago after a campaign by the Mirror and families of former footballers.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Three of England's World Cup-winning squad - Nobby Stiles, Martin Peters and Ray Wilson \u2013 were later diagnosed with dementia", "authors": ["Warren Manger", "Image", "Getty", "Popperfoto Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20699704.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BallsMAIN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
