Cancel order!,\u201d Trump tweeted in December 2016.\n\nSince then, Trump has claimed to have negotiated a significantly lower price for the program, which includes two Boeing 747 jets that are being modified heavily for presidential use. \u201cWe've got that price down by over $1 billion and I probably haven't spoken for more than an hour on the project,\u201d Trump declared in 2018. \u201cI got the generals in who are fantastic \u2026 but I told Boeing that isn't good enough, the price is still too high.\u201d\n\nEstimates made last year, however, suggest that Trump hadn\u2019t actually reduced the projected cost much, if at all, with the price still coming in at around $4 billion. And now, according to the latest projections from the Air Force, it looks like the price has actually gone up by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nBased on the Pentagon\u2019s acquisition report on the project, the pair of jets that will be used as Air Force One is projected to cost $4.7 billion, Air Force Magazine reported last week. Add in the cost of hangar construction, engineering and other related components, and the total comes to $5.2 billion.\n\nAn Air Force spokesperson gave The Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank a different breakdown \u2013 $3.9 billion for Boeing and $1.4 billion for related costs \u2013 with an even higher total cost of $5.3 billion.\n\n\u201cApples-to-apples comparisons are tricky, largely because Trump tends to make up numbers,\u201d Milbank wrote Wednesday, \u201cbut by any measure, the price tag is up \u2014 bigly \u2014 from when Trump first complained about it.\u201d\n\nLike what you're reading?
