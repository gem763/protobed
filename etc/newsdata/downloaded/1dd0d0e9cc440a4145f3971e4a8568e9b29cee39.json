Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Trump plans to air accusations of Iranian violence in meetings with world leaders throughout the week, a senior administration official said, adding Iran will be a top theme of the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering.\n\nMr. Trump is hoping to build an international coalition to pressure Iran, using last weekend\u2019s cruise missile and drone strikes against a Saudi oil field and refinery as fresh evidence of Tehran\u2019s wrongdoing. He will be accompanied at the U.N. by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has spent the week calling U.S. allies and traveling to the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe regime in Tehran must be held accountable through diplomatic isolation and economic pressure,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\n\nIran\u2019s central bank had already been sanctioned by the administration, but Friday\u2019s designation marks the first time a monetary authority has ever been blacklisted by the U.S. for ties to terror and is expected to further isolate the country both financially and politically.\n\nRelated Video An attack on Saudi Aramco oil facilities has led to an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. While Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are pointing to evidence Iran was involved. Here's what we know so far.\n\nThe action is expected to squeeze Iran\u2019s collapsing economy, economic warfare the administration says is meant to force Iran into abandoning its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and curb its interventions in regional conflicts.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would defy the sanctions, Iran\u2019s state TV reported, and threatened further breaches of the 2015 nuclear accord. The U.S. exited the deal last year before reimposing an economy-wide pressure campaign. Iran has in recent weeks enriched uranium beyond agreed levels, an act interpreted by Western officials as an implicit threat to rev up its nuclear weapons program.\n\n\u201cIf their commitments is incomplete, so is ours,\u201d Mr. Rouhani was quoted as saying in a cabinet meeting. \u201cIf it becomes necessary in the future, we will take other steps.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s leadership has rejected accusations Tehran is behind the attacks in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe sanctions also hit the National Development Fund of Iran and Etemad Tejarate Pars Co., an Iranian firm controlled by the government.\n\nThe National Development Fund is estimated to be valued at $80 billion to $100 billion, with significant sums held in overseas accounts around the world, analysts say. The sanctions will force foreign institutions to freeze those accounts and deny Iran access to their funds or risk facing U.S. sanctions themselves.\n\nThat money\u2014as well as any central bank accounts outside Iran\u2014is critical for Iran\u2019s financing of the last vestiges of international trade keeping its economy on life support.\n\nIran\u2019s central bank and the National Development Fund have been used by the regime to finance its proxies fighting in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen rather than safeguarding the welfare of the Iranian people, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\n\n\u201cTreasury\u2019s action targets a crucial funding mechanism that the Iranian regime uses to support its terrorist network, including the Quds Force, Hezbollah, and other militants that spread terror and destabilize the region,\u201d said Mr. Mnuchin, whose department is responsible for executing the administration\u2019s economy-wide \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign.\n\nIran\u2019s Quds Force, an elite military unit within Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is responsible for financing, arming and directing Tehran\u2019s proxies in regional conflicts, including Hezbollah.\n\nAlthough the U.S. has provided special exceptions for humanitarian supplies, some fear the latest action could hit those imports. The sanctions \u201cwill likely eviscerate humanitarian trade with Iran,\u201d said Ryan Costello, policy director of the National Iranian American Council.\n\nThe threat of losing access to U.S. markets has forced companies around the world to pull out of Iran and cut off financial ties, including by slashing exports of Iran\u2019s crucial oil revenues and cutting Iran\u2019s access to global banking infrastructure.\n\nSome countries opposed to Washington\u2019s decision to pull out of the nuclear accord and reimpose sanctions, including U.S. allies, have maintained financial ties.\n\nA terror-blacklisting, however, often makes targets international pariahs and support of such entities politically more unpalatable.\n\nTechnically, the sanctions freeze any assets the targets have in U.S. territory and prohibit any transactions by U.S.-based people, banks or companies. But more importantly, anyone found doing business with them also risks facing sanctions that could cut off their access to the U.S., the world\u2019s most important financial market and biggest engine of the global economy.\n\nTreasury said Iran\u2019s central bank was involved in transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from the development fund to Iran\u2019s Atomic Energy Organization and the Ministry of Defense Armed Forces Logistics, which is responsible for manufacturing ballistic missiles. The government planned to use Etemad Tejarate Pars Co. for military purchases, including from Russia, it said.\n\nIran has been tapping the National Development Fund, in collaboration with the central bank, to finance Quds Force operations over the last several years, Treasury officials said. As oil revenues plummeted in the wake of the sanctions, reliance on that sovereign-wealth fund has grown, with Tehran pulling out $4.8 billion in January to fund the Revolutionary Guard and the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, its media arm that Iran experts say is a key tool for spreading the regime\u2019s propaganda.\n\nBy hitting the three institutions under terror powers, the associated stigma will deter future financing even if a new administration decides to reverse the Trump Iran policy and re-engage with Tehran, said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank that advocates for tougher sanctions against Iran.\n\nAs Tehran tries to access its newly sanctioned international accounts, it will expose any other hidden overseas accounts the intelligence community didn\u2019t already know about, Mr. Dubowitz said.\n\nIran experts say the Trump administration\u2019s sanctions campaign could fuel a political uprising that overturns the current regime and repositions Tehran into a government more amenable to Washington\u2019s demands.\n\nBut others say the regime\u2019s grip\u2014secured by killing and torturing dissidents, and undermining previous sources of political power that have historically been able to challenge the government\u2014is too secure.\n\nWrite to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. blacklisted the central bank of Iran and two other major state financial institutions, President Trump said Friday, severing some of Iran\u2019s last remaining ties to world markets in a move meant to punish Tehran for attacks on critical oil supplies in Saudi Arabia last week.", "authors": ["Ian Talley", "Rebecca Ballhaus", "Ian.Talley Wsj.Com", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109302/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
