When it was the turn of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, to answer, he spoke about the years in which he lived with the fear that, as a military officer and an elected official in a socially conservative community, revealing that he was gay would end his career. But he reached a point, he said, where he was \u201cnot interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer,\u201d and he came out during the final months of a campaign. \u201cWhen I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them,\u201d he said, \u201cthey decided to trust me, and re\u00eblected me with eighty per cent of the vote. And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s story was moving on its own terms, but it also threw into relief a fundamental question of the Democratic primary race: What vision of themselves\u2014and of voters\u2014are the candidates willing to trust? At a basic level, that question has to do with being able to convince voters that they\u2019re being spoken to without deceit. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, of El Paso, has that ability, and it was on display in one of his stronger moments on Thursday. Asked whether he was serious when he said that he would require the owners of military-style weapons to sell them to the government, he replied, \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d Politicians are often anxious to offer assurances that no one is coming for anyone\u2019s guns, but O\u2019Rourke said he believed that these gun owners, too, were sick of seeing children dying in mass shootings. When he visited a gun show recently, he added, some people told him that they would be willing to give up their guns, because \u201cI don\u2019t need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself.\u201d Doing the right thing, O\u2019Rourke said, was not a separate task from bringing all Americans, including conservative Republicans, \u201cinto the conversation.\u201d\n\nThe health-care segment of the debate also hinged on questions of trust. The Medicare for All bill, which Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, wrote, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, signed on to, includes a provision\u2014\u201con page eight,\u201d as Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, helpfully pointed out\u2014that would effectively ban most forms of private insurance. In this respect, the bill is far more restrictive than not only the \u201cpublic option\u201d but also the European universal-health-care systems that Sanders admires. Both Buttigieg, who favors \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d and Senator Kamala Harris, of California, who introduced a plan in July that includes a longer transition and a larger role for private insurers, maintained that people should be trusted to choose their own option. (Harris has zigzagged on the issue\u2014she originally signed on to Sanders\u2019s bill\u2014raising a different question of trust. Senator Cory Booker, of New Jersey, who co-sponsored the bill, has also backed away from elements of it.) When Sanders said that workers whose unions had agreed to wage cuts in return for private health-care coverage would be able to recover that money from their employers, Vice-President Joe Biden told him, \u201cFor a socialist, you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\u201d\n\nThat exchange, like several others on Thursday, was largely about how radical, or just how ambitious, the Party is prepared to be. Is sweeping, structural reform the best way to effect change, or is Obamacare worth building on? (Some factions in the Party have been busy rejecting parts of Barack Obama\u2019s legacy\u2014in the area of immigration, for example.) Pervasive doubt about existing institutions could make it easier to persuade people to commit to entirely new ways of doing things; it could also lead them to give up on a political system that they think is irredeemable, or just mean. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, did not help matters when, during a discussion of public-option insurance enrollment, he seemed gleeful at a chance to portray Biden as doddery\u2014\u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d he asked. Castro later said that his approach was the way the primaries are supposed to play out. But his gibe seemed a crude bit of gaslighting, since Biden hadn\u2019t quite said what Castro claimed he had. As Klobuchar put it in an interview following the debate, the remark was \u201cnot cool.\u201d\n\nCastro barely qualified for the debate; he is averaging about one per cent in the polls. Of the ten candidates on-stage, only three\u2014Biden, Warren, and Sanders\u2014are polling in the double digits. For some of the others, to continue competing seems to call for either an extraordinary amount of confidence in themselves or, especially in the case of Andrew Yang, in the resonance of their message. Yang, a businessman, presents a notable example of the twinned qualities of pessimism and hope. He believes that, in the face of automation, traditional responses to unemployment, such as retraining programs, are hopeless, but that, with a universal basic income of a thousand dollars a month and the \u201cboot off of people\u2019s throats,\u201d Americans will not sink into inertia but remake their lives and their country. He undercut his own message on Thursday, however, by announcing, game-show style, that his campaign would give that money to ten American families so that they could try the plan. At its most developed, the strength of the case for basic income lies in how it would change the entire economic climate, not just the prospects of a few lucky winners.\n\nThere is also the reciprocal aspect of the trust equation: having faith in voters. The Democratic Party seems split on the question of how much of its resources should be directed toward certain voters, particularly white working-class men struggling with deindustrialization. The willingness of so many voters to cast their ballots for Donald Trump has been disorienting. But the case remains that some of those same people previously voted for Obama. The categories are rarely neat. As Buttigieg noted, \u201cWhere I come from, a lot of times that displaced autoworker is a single black mother of three.\u201d\n\nNone of this is easy. Even Buttigieg\u2019s decision to come out publicly, which he did in 2015, would likely have turned out very differently twenty years ago. But it is true that the victories surrounding L.G.B.T.Q. rights have been brought about by a combination of activism, litigation, and people telling their stories within their communities\u2014through conversation, as O\u2019Rourke put it, as well as confrontation. This is how primaries ought to play out. Every election is an exercise in trust. \u2666", "description": "Last week\u2019s debate was largely about how radical, or just how ambitious, the Party and its candidates are prepared to be, Amy Davidson Sorkin writes.", "authors": ["Amy Davidson Sorkin", "Rachel Syme", "Zuzana Justman", "Jonathan Franzen", "Dan Kois", "Patrick Radden Keefe", "Benjamin Wallace-Wells", "Michael Luo"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d7c470498fe710007efca0a/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Comment-ADS-ThirdDemDebate-FACEBOOK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
