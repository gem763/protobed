Succinct. Supportive.\n\nAs Goodwin sat inside that Chandler, Arizona, church a few offseasons ago, he understood what his longtime friend and Cardinals head coach was doing. Arians was giving his offensive coordinator license to coach the offensive installs the way he saw fit. In essence, Arians was freeing one of his most trusted coaches to take the next step in his development.\n\n\u201cHe really doesn\u2019t sit you down and give you the vision,\u201d Goodwin said in a recent interview with Yahoo Sports. \u201cHe just tries to push you towards the vision.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay head coach Bruce Arians (R) isn't micromanaging coordinator Byron Leftwich and his handling of the Bucs' offense. (Getty Images)\n\nArians is drawn to people like him: Talented, but oftentimes overlooked. Underdogs with something to prove. Driven individuals eager for an opportunity.\n\nNo matter their race.\n\nNo matter their gender.\n\nNo matter what others think.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see color, I just see quality,\u201d Arians told Yahoo Sports during a separate sit-down interview at the Bucs\u2019 facility. \u201cAnd opportunity doesn\u2019t always come. I thought I should have had a head-coaching opportunity a long time ago. Called plays in the Super Bowl. Won the game. No phone calls.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s part of it too \u2014 to give people of quality opportunity. Regardless of gender or race.\u201d\n\nThat has been Arians\u2019 approach since he became one of the youngest Division I head coaches at Temple in 1983. And it\u2019s the same philosophy he employed this offseason when he emerged from a yearlong retirement to accept the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 head-coaching gig and configure a staff made in his image.\n\nAll three of his coordinators \u2014 Todd Bowles (defense), Byron Leftwich (offense) and Keith Armstrong (special teams) \u2014 are black. So, too, is Goodwin, his assistant head coach and run game coordinator. Arians also hired the first two female coaches in franchise history \u2014 Lori Locust, a defensive line assistant, and Maral Javadifar, an assistant strength and conditioning coach.\n\nArians is the first NFL head coach to have three black coordinators and the Bucs are the first NFL team with two female coaches. But Arians isn\u2019t looking to fill quotas or earn political points.\n\nHis method is simple: Surround yourself with the best people.\n\nAnd, in his mind, he has.\n\nBut there\u2019s something deeper behind his motives, a mission far more intentional.\n\n\u2018All you need is one\u2019\n\nArians is more than just someone who doesn\u2019t see race or sex. Such a simplistic characterization dilutes the deliberate essence of his actions. Rather, the 66-year-old has made a concerted effort to see race and gender for what they often are \u2014 liabilities in the eyes of the ignorant. In life. And in the NFL.\n\n\u201cI think the game needs it,\u201d Arians said during a 20-minute interview in his spacious office decorated with commemorative footballs, family pictures and a large painting of legendary Alabama football coach Paul \u201cBear\u201d Bryant to the right of his oversized desk.\n\n\u201cThey need the opportunity. When I coached guys that I knew would be good coaches, I kind of push them. And they\u2019re going to be really good for the game.\u201d\n\nThat approach makes him a rarity in today\u2019s NFL, where executives and team owners charged with hiring the most innovative football minds often gravitate to faces that mirror their own reflections.\n\nHarold Goodwin, the Bucs' assistant head coach and run game coordinator, has been with Bruce Arians across 11 NFL seasons. (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I tell black coaches \u2014 and, unfortunately, it\u2019s just part of the deal \u2014 \u2018All you need is one,\u2019 \u201d Goodwin said. \u201cAnd what I mean by that is: You need one white guy in your corner who has the power or leverage.\u201d\n\nIn Tampa, Arians has assembled what he has always wanted: A staff forged through Virginia Tech (his alma mater) and Temple ties, fortified by loyalty and aimed at improving the play of quarterback Jameis Winston and a revamped Bucs roster. These coaches are some of his closest confidants. His brothers. His family.\n\nThose bonds are what made Bowles, Armstrong, Leftwich, Goodwin, and others, immediately say \u201cyes\u201d when Arians called and simply asked: \u201cYou coming?\u201d And it\u2019s those connections that have this staff believing in the potential of their new team and Arians\u2019 long-term vision.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the big things in getting me back into coaching \u2014 that my guys were all available,\u201d Arians said, seated behind his large mahogany desk.\n\nHe then smiled.\n\n\u201cThey just happened to be black,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way I can put it. They\u2019re the best I know.\u201d\n\nThree of the Bucs\u2019 past seven head coaches have been black (Tony Dungy, Raheem Morris and Lovie Smith), but this staff features the first trio of black coordinators. More notably, Leftwich is the only black offensive play-caller in the NFL.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not doing me no favors by just giving me a job,\u201d Leftwich, 39, said while seated in his office overlooking the team\u2019s outdoor practice field. \u201cI know this man really cares for me. I know it\u2019s bigger than just giving me a job.\u201d\n\n\u2018Shoulder to shoulder\u2019\n\nBecause of that love, Arians has purposely kept his distance from the Bucs\u2019 offense.\n\nFor his sake. And Leftwich\u2019s.\n\nHealth issues (Arians is a two-time cancer survivor) and stress forced an abbreviated retirement from coaching after the 2017 season. But when \u201cthe perfect storm\u201d converged this past offseason \u2014 \u201cOwnership. The general manager I really trust and worked with [Jason Licht]. All my guys. And the quarterback,\u201d he explained \u2014 Arians was more than eager to return to the sideline.\n\nBut this time, he\u2019s entrusting his unit to Leftwich. For the first time in his career, Arians won\u2019t be calling the plays on gameday \u2014 a notable departure from his admitted micromanaging ways of the past.\n\nAllowing others to lead doesn\u2019t come naturally, but it now is a necessity. Because of his age. Because of his health (\u201cThe two things that create the most stress: injuries and officiating. The officiating\u2019s so bad, that\u2019s the other thing that put me in the hospital,\u201d Arians joked).\n\nAnd because he is surrounded by staffers he implicitly trusts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been shoulder to shoulder with him the whole time. It\u2019s just the rest of the world didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Leftwich, who was Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s backup in the 2008 and 2010 seasons when Arians was the Steelers offensive coordinator.\n\nLeftwich later became Arians\u2019 coaching intern in Arizona in 2016 before being promoted to quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator under Arians\u2019 successor, Steve Wilks.\n\n\u201cI know how this man thinks. I know how he sees the game.\u201d\n\nIn an effort not to step on Leftwich\u2019s toes, Arians avoids the offensive meeting rooms. After the Bucs\u2019 first preseason game against Pittsburgh, the coaches and quarterback whisperer-turned-Bucs\u2019 season-long consultant, Tom Moore, gathered to watch film. But Arians was noticeably absent.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want Byron to feel any pressure,\u201d said Goodwin, who spent 11 seasons coaching under Arians in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Arizona. \u201cI remember things always being this way and I just think B.A. wants Byron to have that freedom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the sideline during preseason calling plays, and Bruce is so antsy about it, like, \u2018Why would you call that?!\u2019 \u201d Goodwin screeched, mimicking Arians\u2019 frenetic energy. \u201cBut at the end of the day he\u2019ll say, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to me. Do what you want to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nArians may not be drawing up weekly gameplans, but he\u2019s still in his office scouring game tape of opponents. He has plenty of extra time on his hands these days, but still arrives at 6:30 most mornings, even if he only ends up watching the NFL Network\u2019s morning show.\n\nTraining camp days began with quick staff meetings, followed by team meetings. \u201cThen I leave and Byron takes over, Todd takes over, Keith takes over, and I come up here and mess with Nelson [Luis, the Bucs\u2019 vice president of communications],\u201d Arians said, with a laugh.\n\nThe rise of young, offensive minds left many veteran and defensive coaches \u2014 especially men of color \u2014 on the periphery during the latest wave of head-coaching hirings. But Arians believes Leftwich is on the verge of breaking through. And this season, he sees his young offensive coordinator being a valuable resource and sounding board for Winston.\n\n\u201cByron, having been an African American in the NFL, has a totally different perspective,\u201d Arians said. \u201cI think it helps Jameis, having someone who looks just like him. He may ask him a question or make a comment he would not make to me, just because of that.\u201d\n\nWinston enthusiastically agreed.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d the 2015 No. 1 overall pick told Yahoo Sports. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not only credibility, it\u2019s relatability and having someone in that position who\u2019s not only played in B.A.\u2019s system but has experience of being an African-American quarterback and who created a better path for me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you see that often in the NFL at all,\u201d Winston added, as he walked off the practice field following the first of two joint training-camp practices with the Miami Dolphins last month. \u201cI think when you have a coach that looks like you, you\u2019re probably more apt and open to listen, more apt to apply what they\u2019re coaching you.\u201d\n\nOn the heels of hiring three black coordinators, Arians defended his decision to hire two female coaches as only he could. \u201cWho gives a s---? They\u2019re good coaches,\u201d he said at the annual league meeting, when asked about Javadifar, a former Seattle-based physical therapist with a sports science background, and Locust, a former Temple student who became the NFL\u2019s third full-time female assistant and the Bucs\u2019 first full-time female position coach.\n\nArians also implored other teams to ensure their hiring practices reflect the wide-range of talent available.\n\n\u201cI want the most qualified guys to get jobs. But that pool should be stronger,\u201d he said at the NFL coaches breakfast, referring to the lopsided number of head coaches of color (four) among the 32 NFL teams. \u201c\u2026 Everybody\u2019s looking for Sean [McVay], and rightfully so. But there\u2019s not enough guys in that pool from offense. We have to build that. We have to build that African-American offensive coordinator/quarterback coach that is going to be a head coach. I think that\u2019s our job as head coaches \u2014 to find those guys.\u201d\n\nDefensive coordinator Todd Bowles: \"We wake up every day and we ain\u2019t gotta look in the mirror \u2014 we know we\u2019re black. That's a given. But to say we got these jobs because we\u2019re African American is not true. I think sometimes people say, \u2018Wow, you guys are three black coordinators, instead of, \u2018Wow, you guys are three good coaches who happen to be African American.\u201d (Getty Images)\n\nCarrying the torch\n\nBowles understands the interest, but it\u2019s a topic he would rather not harp on.\n\nNevertheless, the Bucs\u2019 new defensive coordinator took a seat in a near-empty room down the hall from the media workroom and beamed as bright as his red, long-sleeved shirt on this mid-August day.\n\n\u201cI love where I am right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in a very good place.\u201d\n\nThis time last year, Bowles was running his own practices as the head coach of the New York Jets. Now, he\u2019s back alongside Arians.\n\nThey were a formidable pair over two seasons in Arizona, where Bowles earned Assistant Coach of the Year honors from the Associated Press and Pro Football Writers of America in 2014 for coaching one of the league\u2019s top defenses.\n\nHis history with Arians has been well-documented, but their reunion, coupled with the arrivals of Armstrong, Goodwin and Leftwich, is now a part of Bucs\u2019 and NFL history. But it\u2019s a distinction that can unintentionally be misconstrued.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we all happen to be on one team and it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re seeing it, that\u2019s great, I get that part,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cBut at the same time, you can\u2019t take away from what we\u2019ve done. There are accolades behind each one of us that we fought and clawed for to get respect in this league.\u201d\n\nThe Jets went 10-6 in his first season in New York, but they failed to make the playoffs during his four-year tenure. Bowles, who had a 24-40 record, was fired in Dec. 2018, five months before GM Mike Maccagnan was surprisingly jettisoned.\n\n\u201cWe wake up every day and we ain\u2019t gotta look in the mirror \u2014 we know we\u2019re black. That's a given,\u201d Bowles said with a laugh. \u201cBut to say we got these jobs because we\u2019re African American is not true. I think sometimes people say, \u2018Wow, you guys are three black coordinators,\u2019 instead of, \u2018Wow, you guys are three good coaches who happen to be African American.\u2019 \u201d\n\nArmstrong and Leftwich echoed those sentiments, noting that if they do a good job, their aptitude will speak for itself. \u201cTrust me, he\u2019s not doing us no favors,\u201d Leftwich said. \u201cB.A feels: \u2018I\u2019m going to get the best people I know.\u2019 And this just happens to be the best people he knows. And I\u2019m happy to be one of those people.\u201d\n\nGoodwin acknowledged their collective presence is \u201ca significant issue\u201d that he takes pride in and credited Arians for \u201ctrying to push coaches that he thinks are good enough to go to the next step. ... We\u2019ve got to somewhat carry the torch and he's given us that platform to carry it.\"\n\nArians has, of course, employed and advocated for plenty of white assistant coaches over his 40-year career. And when he accepted the Bucs job, he quickly corralled longtime friends, among them, Nick Rapone, Amos Jones and Rick Christophel. But it\u2019s Arians\u2019 desire to champion qualified minority and female candidates that make him an outlier in an NFL beholden to the status-quo.\n\n\u201cIf you get somebody like Bruce who will empower you, who will push you, I think doors can be opened,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a person of a different race willing to push an individual who may be of color, then I think it\u2019s a little tougher. And I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be with Bruce.\n\n\u201cMike Tomlin has helped develop me as a coach. So has Lovie [Smith]. So has Chuck Pagano. But I think it\u2019s been Bruce, in my professional career, who\u2019s pushed me the furthest. And he just happens to be a white guy.\u201d\n\nArians\u2019 vision has always entailed empowering men and women like himself \u2014 individuals with a \u201cblue-collar\u201d work ethic, a desire to be great, and an understanding of what matters most.\n\n\u201cTrust, loyalty and respect,\u201d Leftwich said. \u201cNothing else really matters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why Arians offered two of his former players \u2014 Larry Foote and Antwaan Randle El \u2014 positions on this staff. It\u2019s why Locust and Javadifar are now in the fold. And it\u2019s why Arians took a special interest in seeing Bowles, Goodwin, Armstrong and Leftwich become successes on and off the field.\n\nSpecial teams coordinator Keith Armstrong gives instructions during training camp. (Getty Images)\n\nThree decades ago, Armstrong was a senior at Temple with aspirations of being a high school coach in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. But it was Arians who single-handedly changed the trajectory of Armstrong\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cWe were out at training camp, stretching, and he walked up to me and said, \u2018Hey man, you\u2019ve got a [graduate assistant] job here next year,\u2019 \u201d said Armstrong, now in his 26th year of coaching and first with Arians since 1988. \u201cWhatever he saw in me, I don\u2019t know. But he knew I was from a single-parent family. My mom was a school teacher. He just always reached out to people to give them a chance. \u2026 He\u2019s always looking for that underdog, that type of personality because you\u2019ve got a little fight in you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why guys like Bowles, Goodwin, Armstrong and Leftwich have become branches in Arians\u2019 coaching tree. And it\u2019s why he would return to coaching only if his guys were available.\n\nAsked how much longer he plans to coach, Arians smiled again.\n\n\u201cUntil we put a ring on our fingers,\" he said. \"Then I can hand it over to one of them.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Arians is the first NFL head coach to have three black coordinators and the Bucs are the first NFL team with two female coaches.
