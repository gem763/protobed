Great.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to take a few moments to write an open letter to you regarding some of your recent thoughts on gun control. In particular, your comments regarding mandatory buybacks.\n\nOn The View earlier this week, Meghan McCain commented that such an act would trigger violence. Her comment sparked outrage all over the internet. You, yourself, argued that McCain\u2019s comments amounted to \u201cIt becomes self-fulfilling; you have people on TV who are almost giving you permission to be violent and saying, \u2018You know this is this is going to happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAllow me to clue you in on something, Beto. There\u2019s not a single gun owner in this country who is looking to Meghan McCain for permission to oppose the tyranny of a mandatory buyback.\n\nMcCain\u2019s comments weren\u2019t permission, they were a warning. It wasn\u2019t something new, something she just pulled out of the ether in order to spark some controversy. She\u2019s merely echoing the statements people have made for decades regarding their willingness to die for their Second Amendment rights.\n\nBy claiming its a self-fulfilling prophecy and that people like McCain are giving people permission, you\u2019re telling on yourself. You\u2019re telling each and every one of us that you have never bothered to listen to a damn thing any of us have said.\n\nI didn\u2019t even know who Meghan McCain was when I first heard someone issue the dire warning that if some form of gun confiscation were to happen, the first thing the jackboots trying to take them would get was the ammunition delivered at high velocity. The gun-rights community has warned that efforts to take away or guns would lead to civil war for years now.\n\nYou just didn\u2019t want to listen.\n\nWe often talk about lawmakers being out of touch, and you\u2019ve just become the poster boy for that, Beto. You are so wrapped up in your liberal bubble that you simply can\u2019t understand that this is a thing, this is something we\u2019ve gone on about for ages. You can\u2019t understand it because you don\u2019t want to understand it. In your mind, we\u2019re all just good little drones who will do whatever Big Daddy Government wants us to do.\n\nWe\u2019re not.\n\nWe\u2019re the heirs of Lexington and Concord. We\u2019re the children of Valley Forge and Bunker Hill. We\u2019re a defiant, freedom-loving bunch that isn\u2019t rolling over because some spoiled rich kid thinks we should.\n\nLet me make it clear for you. If you come for our guns, we are going to fight back. We don\u2019t look to Meghan McCain for permission to do that. She could tell us not to, and we\u2019d still fight back.\n\nBeto, you need to understand. You need to learn. You need to come to grasp the simple fact that we\u2019re not like you. We don\u2019t look at government as an unmitigated good whose lead we should always follow. We have reasons for that. It\u2019s called the history of the 20th Century filled with countless atrocities, atrocities carried out under the umbrella of government.\n\nThose atrocities could only be carried out because the populations were unarmed.\n\nWe\u2019re not sheep. We will not be herded into genocide all because some well-meaning but sheltered rich boy who has never lived in a high-crime neighborhood in his life could tell us what we need and don\u2019t need.\n\nMeghan McCain gave no one permission for anything. Further, gun owners don\u2019t need such a permission. Our permission was penned in 1776 and signed on July 4th.\n\nTags:", "description": "Beto O'Rourke thinks Meghan McCain gave gun owners permission to respond to gun confiscation.
