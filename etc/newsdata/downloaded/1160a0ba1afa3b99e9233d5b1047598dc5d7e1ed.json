The department signaled its new, broader position in a legal filing Monday, part of a lawsuit challenging the law's individual insurance mandate.\n\nWhy it matters: A ruling striking down the entire ACA would upend major parts of the health care system. Millions of people would lose their health care coverage, and a host of seemingly unrelated policies \u2014 including new experiments in how Medicare pays for care and an entire class of prescription drugs \u2014 would also go out the window.", "description": "The stakes were already high.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/tGJ15mdFKG29lRreu4gbm7IYCE4=/0x0:3000x1688/1920x1080/2019/03/26/1553565666412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-26"}
