(Christopher Hanewinckel/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNBA commentator Charles Barkley fired at Mike Pence on Thursday night after the vice president strongly criticized the NBA\u2019s intimate business relationship with China during a policy speech.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up,\u201d Barkley said during an NBA pregame show on TNT. \u201cAll American companies are doing business in China. I thought the criticism of Commissioner Silver and LeBron James was unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why these holier-than-thou politicians \u2014 if they\u2019re so worried about China, then why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China?\u201d he added.\n\nBarkley\u2019s tirade came as NBA commissioner Adam Silver sat two seats across from him, though Silver did not respond directly to Barkley\u2019s comments.\n\nCharles Barkley on TNT NBA pregame replying to VP\u2019s comment of China & the NBA \u201cVice President Pence needs to shut the hell up\u201d pic.twitter.com/dBSSHMHlRd \u2014 WonderousATX (@wonderousATX) October 24, 2019\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Pence accused the league of acting like a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime\u201d during a speech.\n\n\u201cSome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China,\u201d Pence charged.\n\nThe vice president also lambasted \u201cprogressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights\u201d as \u201crepressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen American corporations, professional sports, pro athletes embrace censorship, it\u2019s not just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s un-American. American corporations should stand up for American values, here at home, and around the world,\u201d Pence said.\n\nChina fired back at the speech, calling Pence\u2019s comments \u201carrogant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has already abandoned and cast aside its morality and credibility,\u201d Chinese spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \u201cWe hope these Americans can look at themselves in the mirror to fix their own problems and get their own house in order.\u201d Barkley echoed the sentiments, saying it was \u201cunfair\u201d that the Trump administration was harping on the situation \u201cto make the NBA and our players look bad.\u201d", "description": "Earlier on Thursday, Pence accused the league of acting like a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime\u201d during a speech.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Ilya Shapiro", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
