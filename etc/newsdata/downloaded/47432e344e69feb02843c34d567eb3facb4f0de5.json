He soon came to be known as \u2018That Train Date Guy\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s been up to all sorts on the Overground, including hanging his washing on a clothes horse, exercising on a treadmill and even shaving\u2026using a whole sink he brought with him.\n\nAs you do.\n\nHis videos have delighted his 44,000-strong Insta followers and beyond, though some of his content has been criticised.\n\nIn the dinner date video, Elvin could be seen preparing a table with a rose and pouring wine for the female traveller sitting next to him.\n\nPeople sharing the video on social media said it the prank was a form of sexual harassment \u2013 but Elvin tells Metro.co.uk that the lady was happy to be in his video.\n\nThe famous train date (Picture: Elvin Mensah)\n\nElvin told us: \u2018Hundreds of thousands of women and several media pages on the internet didn\u2019t see it as harassment. They got the joke.\n\n\u2018The passengers on the train and the lady who was my \u201cdate\u201d were evidently amused by the prank so that\u2019s saying something.\n\n\u2018Anyone who is good at what they do will always have haters, it\u2019s just part of life. I don\u2019t let any of that get to me but rather use it as fuel to keep delivering content of good quality that people will enjoy.\u2019\n\nElvin\u2019s been doing comedy skits for years now. He started by writing funny stories on Facebook around six years ago.\n\nNothing to see here, just a man setting up a treadmill on the Overground (Picture: Elvin Mensah)\n\nHe adds: \u2018I\u2019m a creative individual and, as a comic, I\u2019m always trying to make observations and find ways to create things that will give people a laugh.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I also get inspiration from things I see or hear people talk about.\u2019\n\nWhen he\u2019s not at work (the Overground) (Picture: Elvin Mensah)\n\nIn another video, Elvin is seen in exercise gear, setting up a treadmill and then going for a run on it. He says that was his favourite to do.\n\nWe have no idea how he kept a straight face.\n\nHe reveals: \u2018A large part of comedy is that it has elements of surprise, spontaneity and audacity\u2019.\n\nMORE: Domino\u2019s delivery driver tries to deliver pizza to the Queen after prank call\n\nMORE: Plastic surgery report reveals the latest trends in body enhancement\n\nMORE: Woman writes on airplane sick bag about a plan to tell her best friend she loves him\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "You might've seen videos of Elvin Mensah doing the rounds on social media after a video of him setting up a date on the train went viral.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRC_84084061_1568128291.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
