Late last year, the Trump administration, including Grisham\u2019s predecessor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was forced ultimately to back down after CNN took Trump and his staffers to court over the revocation of Acosta\u2019s White House hard pass. That episode resulted in a flood of press coverage, and a judge ruling that Team Trump had violated the constitutional rights of the network\u2019s correspondent.\n\n\u201cBefore doing something that could potentially get significant media attention, I wanted to make sure the president was aware,\u201d Grisham added. \u201cI went to him with my recommendation and he asked if I was sure, and I said, yes, I was sure. And he said \u2018I support you,\u2019 and that was that.\u201d\n\nLast month following a White House press conference in the Rose Garden, Karem, a flamboyantly outspoken, anti-Trump correspondent for Playboy, got into a heated exchange with bombastic former White House aide Sebastian Gorka after Karem said pro-Trump personalities present were \u201ceager\u201d to be possessed by demons. Gorka mocked Karem\u2019s journalistic credibility, and the Playboy reporter asked Gorka if he wanted to \u201cgo outside and have a long conversation,\u201d interpreted by Gorka and others as a ham-handed threat of physical violence.\n\nEarlier this month, with the president\u2019s blessing, Grisham announced she would suspend Karem\u2019s security hard pass for 30 days. The White House argued that Karem\u2019s behavior was \u201cunacceptable and disruptive, and requires a response to ensure that it does not happen again.\u201d\n\nKarem, in turn, promptly sued both Trump and Grisham, hoping to reinstate his pass and argue that the month-long suspension was another front in Trumpworld\u2019s all-out war on a free American press.\n\n\u201cThe president took questions from Mr. Karem after this incident in the Rose Garden took place, so if we were trying to silence him as he purports, the president wouldn\u2019t have taken his questions,\u201d Grisham contended. \u201cWe also said Playboy was welcome to send a reporter in his place in the 30 days. This was in our written communications... Playboy and Karem\u2019s attorneys didn\u2019t respond to it.\u201d\n\nTheodore Boutrous Jr., a lawyer who represented Acosta and now Karem, has repeatedly argued that the suspension was \u201cclearly pretextual, based on rules made up after the fact and applied to an incident that everyone had already forgotten about and that Ms. Grisham did not even witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the president took questions from Brian after the July 11 Rose Garden incident actually proves that there is no compelling reason to suspend him: they\u2019ve never had a problem with his conduct before, and obviously do not think he has been causing problems since,\u201d Boutrous told The Daily Beast. \u201cWith respect to Ms. Grisham\u2019s second point, journalists are not fungible and sending a substitute does nothing to ameliorate the harm to both Brian and Playboy as a result of the suspension.\u201d\n\nIn a court hearing on Tuesday, a U.S. District Court judge overseeing the case expressed skepticism of Karem\u2019s argument that he was not threatening a physical altercation with Gorka. But the judge also seemed to push back against the White House\u2019s rules about the professional conduct, and pointed out that the White House had ignored the conduct of some of its allies who were present during the confrontation.\n\nStill, for as much as the Playboy correspondent antagonizes the White House, he doesn\u2019t appear to take up too much space in the president\u2019s mind, at least not nearly to the degree of Erin Burnett, Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, or any of the other CNN regulars about whom the president has made a habit of nastily tweeting.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from occasionally trash-talking Karem when he\u2019s not around.\n\nAccording to three people who\u2019ve spoken to the president in the past year and a half about the Playboy journalist and CNN commentator, Trump has privately mocked Karem using typical Trump parlance, such as calling him \u201ca nobody\u201d and a \u201closer\u201d who has repeatedly acted \u201cvery rude[ly] to\u201d Sarah Sanders, the now-former White House press secretary who left her post earlier this year. (When the Trump White House used to hold televised press briefings, Karem and Sanders would tussle from time to time, with the former accusing the latter of lacking empathy and waging a war on the political press, and the latter accusing the former of just wanting to hog more of the media spotlight for himself.)\n\nThe ongoing court fight over Karem\u2019s hard pass presents yet another legal headache for the administration. But among Trumpworld acolytes and its followers, the incident that sparked the legal battle merely gained Gorka, the former White House aide at the center of the Rose Garden episode, more attaboys and credibility among the Trump faithful.\n\nShortly after the verbal spat with Karem in the Rose Garden, Gorka headed over to the lobby bar and lounge area of the Trump International Hotel, just a short walk from the White House. When Gorka arrived at the hotel, numerous fans and strangers kept coming up to him, cheering him on and lauding Gorka for noisily confronting Karem, according to a source present at the time.\n\nGorka, a former White House official who was ousted during the start of the John Kelly era, is now a Salem Radio host who still enjoys the fandom of, and the occasional private audience with, President Trump. Early last year, the president invited Gorka back into the White House for a private dinner in part to gossip and to lavish praise on his ex-aide for his appearances on Fox News programs.\n\nKarem, for his part, generally remains an outsider among the White House press corps. While much of the press corps values pointed, yet cordial questions, the Playboy correspondent often has no problem openly criticizing the administration during televised briefings. But in a statement this week, the White House Correspondents Association threw its official support behind Karem, filing an amicus brief supporting his legal action against the White House.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the government\u2019s argument that neither the due process clause nor the first amendment constrains the administration in determining who gets access to the White House,\u201d WHCA president Jonathan Karl said in a statement. \u201cWe also believe giving the White House Press Secretary unfettered discretion to determine what is \u2018professional\u2019 or \u2018unprofessional\u2019 conduct would have a chilling effect on journalists.\u201d\n\nThe Trump White House, unsurprisingly, is unmoved by this argument\u2014at least as it pertains to Playboy\u2019s White House correspondent and part-time Gorka antagonist.\n\n\u201cI really do stand by the decision that I made,\u201d said Grisham \u201cThis is the White House and people should behave in a certain way when they\u2019re here in a professional capacity, and he didn\u2019t do that.\u201d", "description": "After a confrontation with Seb Gorka, reporter Brian Karem had his WH access temporarily nixed after the president signed off on it.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Maxwell Tani", "White House Reporter", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567055182/190829-swin-tani-trump-playboy-hero_vujbgp"}
