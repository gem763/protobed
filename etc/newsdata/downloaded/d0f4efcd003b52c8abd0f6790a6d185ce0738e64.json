They described Mr Trump's actions as a \"national security concern\", and said he appeared to have committed \"an unconscionable abuse of power\".\n\nMr Trump dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a \"witch-hunt\".\n\nImpeachment is a two-stage political process, rarely exercised, by which a US president can be removed from office for wrongdoing.\n\nEven if President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives, he is unlikely to be forced out of the White House because Republicans control the Senate.\n\nWhat did Mr Klimkin say?\n\nMr Klimkin, who was serving as foreign minister when Mr Shokin was sacked in 2016, said there was \"definitely\" no evidence that his removal was for anything other than corruption.\n\n\"The whole sense of this push was to sort out, to deliver on reforms in Ukraine,\" he said. \"It was not about the prosecutor general. It was about prosecutor offices which were systemically corrupt.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Did Trump ask for \"a favour\" in return for aid to Ukraine?\n\nHe said it was important to have a full reshuffle of the offices, and pressure was coming from the whole international community, not just Mr Biden or the US individually.\n\nThe BBC's Jonah Fisher in Kiev says Mr Klimkin's words serve to reinforce what has been the almost universal reaction from credible voices in Kiev, namely that Mr Shokin had been an obstacle to fighting corruption.\n\nWhat is the claim about Joe Biden?\n\nOn 25 July Mr Trump raised Mr Shokin's removal during a phone call with newly-elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, details of which were released by the White House this week.\n\nHe went on to discuss Mr Biden's son Hunter and the unsubstantiated allegation that his father - then the US vice-president - stopped an investigation into his son's employer by lobbying Ukraine to fire Mr Shokin.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThe chief prosecutor's office had an open inquiry into Burisma, a natural gas company on which Hunter Biden was a board member.\n\nThere is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nWhen Mr Shokin was replaced, his successor continued to investigate Burisma for 10 months before the inquiry ended.\n\nWhy is the phone call controversial?\n\nDemocrats accuse Mr Trump of illegally seeking foreign help in the hope of smearing Mr Biden - who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe US president called on the Ukrainian leader to talk to US Attorney General William Barr and Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani about investigating Hunter Biden's past business dealings.\n\nMr Trump is also accused of using military aid to Ukraine as a bargaining tool. The package - which has since been released - had been appropriated by Congress to support US interests in a friendly country.\n\nMr Trump, a Republican, denies any wrongdoing and has dismissed the impeachment proceedings as a \"hoax\" and \"another witch-hunt\".\n\nHe acknowledged that he had personally blocked nearly $400m (\u00a3324m) in military aid to Ukraine days before he spoke to Mr Zelensky, but denied that it was to pressure the Ukrainian leader into investigating Mr Biden.\n\nWho is the whistleblower?\n\nFew details are known. A lawyer for the whistleblower warned that trying to identify the person could place them \"in harm's way\".\n\nThe New York Times, Washington Post and Reuters news agency identified the whistleblower as a CIA officer.\n\nMeanwhile, an audio recording has emerged in which Mr Trump demands to know who provided information to the whistleblower.\n\n\"I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information. Because that's close to a spy,\" the president said in private remarks to staff at the UN. The recording was provided to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the execution of spies by the US in the past, he adds: \"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right?\"\n\nThe remarks were condemned by senior House Democrats. In a joint statement they said the comments constituted \"reprehensible witness intimidation\".\n\nWhat does the complaint say?\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint accuses Mr Trump of \"using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the US 2020 election\".\n\nThe declassified document characterises the president's conduct as a \"serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US citizens react to the latest developments\n\nThe whistleblower says they had learned from several sources that senior White House officials had intervened to \"lock down\" all records of the call, particularly an official word-for-word transcript.\n\n\"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call,\" the whistleblower wrote in the complaint.\n\nHow the controversy unfolded", "description": "Pavlo Klimkin denies a Ukraine prosecutor was sacked over a probe into the ex-US vice-president's son.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07phk3y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
