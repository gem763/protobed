Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former chair of the Democratic National Committee, accused the chief of the government\u2019s legal immigration agency Wednesday of pursuing a \u201cwhite supremacist ideology,\u201d sparking a brief row in a congressional committee.\n\nThe Florida Democrat also complained about a \u201cspecious\u201d distinction between legal and illegal immigration, and accused acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli of \u201cintimidation tactics\u201d to try to keep \u201cbrown\u201d people out.\n\n\u201cYou want to block all immigration and make life harder for immigrants and you have demonstrated you will pursue this heinous, white supremacist ideology at all costs,\u201d she told him during a hearing of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nMr. Cuccinelli fervently denied the accusation \u2014 \u201cI am not a white supremacist, as you alluded,\u201d he said \u2014 but Ms. Wasserman Schultz retorted that he had \u201cwhite supremacist followers.\u201d\n\nThen, using her privilege as the questioner, she shut down his attempts to respond.\n\n\u201cThe time is not yours,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, I yield back the time, and the witness does not have the floor.\u201d\n\nWhat seemed to irk Ms. Wasserman Schultz were Mr. Cuccinelli\u2019s issuance of a new policy earlier this year potentially denying the chance at a path to citizenship for migrants who have made widespread use of some welfare programs.\n\nA USCIS official later told The Washington Times that if Ms. Wasserman Schultz and other members of Congress don\u2019t like the laws USCIS is carrying out, they can write new ones.\n\n\u201cWhen some in Congress refuse to debate policy on the merits, they instead resort to baseless, slanderous attacks,\u201d the official said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
