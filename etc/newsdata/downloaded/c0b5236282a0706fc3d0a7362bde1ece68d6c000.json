Open every evening from Thursday to Saturday (no bookings required, you can just walk in), there\u2019s a definite sense of the weekend in the air in this urban underground bar. The cocktail menu ranges from the classics to the more adventurous, shaken up by the expert mixology team, and starting at a reasonable \u00a37.50.\n\nIf you visit this week (or until 13 October), you\u2019ll be lucky enough to get to try the very special cocktail created especially for Guardian Soulmates for London Cocktail Week. \u2018You & Me\u2019 is a blend of Bombay Sapphire Gin, extra shiso umeshu plum wine, lime juice and a homemade sweet wasabi syrup, a perfect match of sweet and sharp. Plus, as it\u2019s #LCW, the cocktail is priced at just \u00a36.\n\nAs if that\u2019s not exciting enough, we think every date night deserves a little sparkle, so Soulmates members will receive a complimentary glass of fizz when dining upstairs in the main restaurant at Heddon Street Kitchen, quoting \u2018Guardian Soulmates\u2019 at the time of booking*.\n\nWe love Hidden Heddon for a fun date in a central location, great for a drink or two before or after dinner in the restaurant upstairs. And with \u2018You & Me\u2019 available only until 13 October, what are you waiting for?\n\nFor more information on Hidden Heddon, visit hiddenheddon.com. To make a booking at Heddon Street Kitchen, call 0207 592 1212 or book online at https://www.gordonramsayrestaurants.com/heddon-street-kitchen\n\n*Promotion available to 2 guests per party, when dining from the a la carte menu, not in conjunction with any offer. Available until 31 October 2019.
