Well-below average rainfall over much of south-east Australia in 2018-19 exacerbated the drought conditions present since mid-2017, as did the above average maximum temperatures recorded in most of the country. Climate change could be making the drought worse. But the Australian continent is the second-driest on earth. Droughts are not natural disasters like bushfires or cyclones, but regular weather events caused by predictably unpredictable rain patterns. From the Federation drought of 1895 to 1903, to the millennium drought of 2001 to 2009, repeated droughts have long marred modern Australia\u2019s history.\n\nA farmer stands on the dry bed of the Namoi River. Getty Images\n\nEmotive stories in the media on the plight of drought-hit farmers has put the Morrison government under intense pressure to do more to address the so-called drought \"crisis\". Adding to the pressure is the threat to the Nationals in rural areas by Pauline Hanson\u2019s opportunistic crusading. This has led the government to commit an extra $100 million to drought relief, transforming the drought into the major new spending pressure on the federal budget. And last week the Prime Minister announced that farmers suffering drought-related financial distress will now qualify for cash handouts \u2013 $13,000 for couples and $7,500 for singles \u2013 for four years in every decade, rather than for three years, as at present. Taxpayer-funded bailouts for other industries experiencing periodic downturns in business conditions would be labelled rent-seeking. But farmers are treated as special cases.\n\nThe Morrison government says long-term plans to mitigate drought are in place. Legislation in July set aside $7 billion, $2 billion of which is allocated to current relief measures. The remaining $5 billion Future Drought Fund is on call for future non-rainy days, and will also deliver $100 million in annual funding for drought resilience projects. But as the Productivity Commission said in its 2009 report into government drought support, the primary responsibility for managing the risk of droughts rests with farmers.\n\nOr as the Prime Minister has rightly said, no \u201cmagic cash splash\u201d can drought-proof the country. The tougher question is whether drought assistance ends up doing harm. What\u2019s the good if struggling farmers end up subsisting on public support for four years in every 10? Small farms in low-rainfall areas that lack scale and diversity may never be self-sustaining. The alternative is for asset rich and income poor farmers to leave the land. Hence the proposal by National Farmers Federation President Fiona Simson for government-funded packages to help farming families exit unviable businesses.\n\nDespite the drought, only about 7000 farmers are receiving the cash handouts. Exiting is an emotional decision for families that have worked properties for generations. Leaving may also be difficult in drought-afflicted areas with few potential buyers (though farmland prices have generally remained high despite the drought). Most farms also include the family home, which may also have been borrowed against to supply working capital. However, every industry in need of restructuring faces complex transition challenges, addressed in other sectors by structural adjustment programs developed, for example, for the Australian car and steel industries. Maybe the direction signalled by the NFF is where agricultural policy needs to head. For if climate change is really making droughts worse, only larger-scale farming may be sustainable. Restructuring of the farm sector may, therefore, be the only way to prevent recurrent droughts from inflicting repeated hardships on small farmers.", "description": "Droughts are regular climate events in Australia.
