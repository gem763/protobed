She says her faith helped her through her terrifying ordeal\n\nMary told Fox News: 'I did not recognize him. I really didn\u2019t know at that point who he was or what he wanted, other than he had a gun held at my daughter\u2019s side, which was pretty scary.'\n\nBut the kidnapping was only the start of her horrific ordeal.\n\nAt one point Shiue stopped the car to threaten the terrified pair as they were making too much noise.\n\nThey were spotted by six-year-old Jason Wilkman, who Shiue quickly grabbed and also forced into the trunk.\n\nHe later pulled the car over again in a remote area of woodland before beating the young boy to death with a metal bar and abandoning his body.\n\nTwisted Ming Sen Shiue - pictured here in 2009 - is serving a life sentence for killing six-year-boy Jason Wilkman, and raping his former high school teacher Mary Stauffer.\n\nShiue then took the mother and daughter to his home, where he shackled them and locked them in a closet.\n\nHe kept the pair at his home for 53 days, raping Mary daily and filming the twisted abuse on a video camera.\n\nHe threatened to kill the pair, as well as Mary's husband and son if they tried to escape.\n\nBeth said: The threat was there, but the reality is, killing us was not his end goal. His end goal was, he was obsessed with my mother and he wanted us to be with him.'\n\n'I think maybe he hoped that we would become his family and forget about our other family and just be his,\u201d Mary told Fox.\n\nAlyson Hannigan starred as Mary Stauffer in the Lifetime movie about the 1980 abduction\n\nThe ordeal finally came to an end on July 7, 1980, when Mary remembered how her father used to take hinge pins out of doors to remove them.\n\nStill chained to her daughter, she managed to break out of the closet while Shiue was away at work, and alert the police, Fox News reports.\n\nShe said: 'I held the door with one hand and I pulled the hinge pin with the other. It came out just like it was greased \u2026 it was a miracle.'\n\nShiue was soon arrested, and later found guilty of kidnapping, rape and murder.\n\nHe was sentenced to 30 years behind bars for the kidnapping and rape, and 40 years for the murder of six-year-old Wilkman, whose remains were discovered after Shiue's capture.\n\nShiue, now 68, was denied parole in 2010 as he is still a threat to society. He was told he would spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nThe Stauffer family say their faith helped them through their ordeal, and they became determined to move on with their lives.\n\nBeth told Fox: 'He had \u2026 53 days, where our lives were basically hell, where he had us and he had control, but he does not get to have the rest of our lives'.\n\nFormer How I Met Your Mother star Hannigan starred as Mary on Lifetime movie 'Abducted: The Mary Stauffer Story', which aired Saturday.", "description": "Former Minnesota teacher Mary Stauffer was abducted at gunpoint with her eight-year-old daughter for 53 days in 1980.
