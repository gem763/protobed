It was the same night his basketball scholarship at Judson University was to be announced.\n\nHenderson was shot twice.\n\n\"I got a call that my son's car was taped off, at about 9:30 p.m.,\" Henderson's mother, Tina, told KETV7. \"I went to the scene and saw the car, but my son was not there.\"\n\nTina Henderson didn't know it at the time, but her son was actually in the hospital undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nOne of the bullets reportedly flew clean through Henderson's leg. The other pierced the teen's lung and traveled all the way down his other leg, damaging organs along the way, according to WCVB. Henderson was quickly rushed to a local hospital, but complications forced him into a coma.\n\nFour days into the coma, doctors noticed one of Henderson's legs was taking on a dark color. Blood wasn't circulating through it. A day after that, his leg lost most of its warmth, Tina Henderson said. Discolored and cold to the touch, doctors amputated Henderson's leg to save his life.\n\n\"This is a good kid, he did not deserve any of this.\"\n\nIn the weeks since the shooting, Henderson's family set up a GoFundMe account asking for donations to help stave off the teen's ballooning medical expenses. The fund has so far brought in over $6,300 in donations from more than 150 donors.\n\nIn addition to the amputation, the family says the gunshot wounds damaged, \"every organ in his abdominal region.\"Once those injuries are healed, Henderson will still need to undergo physical and occupational therapy. Eventually, Henderson's family wrote on the donation site, he'll need to be fitted with a prosthetic leg.\n\n\u2014Omaha Benson Hoops (@BensonBoysBball) February 13, 2019\n\n\"This is a good kid, he did not deserve any of this,\" KeShon's aunt, Juarquate Brown said in an interview with KETV7. \"He always had a ball in his hand, so this one right here is really tough.\"\n\nRead more: I loved college but don't regret dropping out.
