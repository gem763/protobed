The second official is among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistle-blower, one of the people said.\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, briefed lawmakers privately on Friday about how he substantiated the whistle-blower\u2019s account. It was not clear whether he told lawmakers that the second official is considering filing a complaint.", "description": "The official, a member of the intelligence community, was interviewed by the inspector general to corroborate the original whistle-blower\u2019s account.", "authors": ["Michael S.
