Here\u2019s what to do (in this order)", "language": "en", "text": "Nowadays, consumers shop online for just about everything. So you\u2019ve likely experienced the stinging disappointment when a TV, piece of furniture or something else you ordered finally arrives on your doorstep \u2014 damaged.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should do if your delivery comes in less-than-optimal shape.\n\n1. Examine the item (thoroughly)\n\nAs soon as you receive a dented box or open a package only to discover broken merchandise, get to work. Take pictures to document the condition of the delivery when it arrived \u2014 retailers may want proof. Hang onto any enclosed packing slips and return labels.\n\nIf the item is brought into your home as opposed to being left on your porch, inspect it for damage before you\u2019re asked to sign off on the delivery. This procedure is common with large products such as a couch or dining set.\n\n2. Contact the retailer (quickly)\n\nMost businesses have return policies on their websites, and there will typically be a section within that policy that addresses damaged or defective items. With a quick Google GOOGL, +0.06% search, you can pull up such policies for big-name retailers like Amazon, AMZN, +0.57% Overstock, OSTK, +4.83% Wayfair W, -0.99% and Best Buy. BBY, +0.69%\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Amazon is prime territory for drunk shoppers\n\nLook for information about how the damaged product should be handled. The return policy at Lowe\u2019s advises contacting customer care within three days of receiving a damaged item.\n\nBest Buy\u2019s policy says customers can return products that were defective or damaged in shipping either to a store location or through the mail during the return and exchange time period. The retailer says to call for return-by-mail instructions and it\u2019ll cover \u201call reasonable and customary ground shipping fees.\u201d\n\nReport the broken item right away so the retailer doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re responsible for the damage, advises Kevin Brasler, executive editor at the nonprofit Consumers\u2019 Checkbook.\n\nIf you don\u2019t notice the damage for weeks, instead of shipping the item back to the retailer for a replacement, you may need to ship it to the manufacturer for repair.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a defective item, the store should just step up and make it right, get you a replacement item as fast as possible,\u201d Brasler says. \u201cIf it\u2019s a warranty issue \u2014 if the thing has broken since you\u2019ve taken delivery \u2014 now you have to deal with the manufacturer and possibly their warranty underwriter.\u201d\n\n3. Unpack the issue (calmly)\n\nOnce you get on the phone with a retailer \u2014 or hop into a chat with an online representative \u2014 clearly articulate how you\u2019d like the problem resolved, says Nicole Leinbach, founder of Retail Minded and an author of \u201cRetail 101: The Guide to Managing and Marketing Your Retail Business.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstand what you want from that conversation so that you can best lead that conversation to a resolution,\u201d she says.\n\nRemaining calm can greatly benefit your interaction with a customer service rep. Acknowledge that your frustration is not directed at the agent, but rather at the situation, Leinbach says.\n\nAlso read: This 31-year-old sold $700,000 of stuff online without buying any inventory\n\nOnce you conclude the call, see the process through to completion. Ship the product back, if you\u2019re asked to, and stay on top of the retailer to ensure your replacement arrives in a timely manner.\n\nIf the seller isn\u2019t willing to work with you on a legitimate issue, tell them you will report them to the Better Business Bureau, recommends Charles R. Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova School of Business.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t change their minds, and you paid for the item with a credit card, you can dispute the charge. Check with your credit card company for full details, but Brasler says 9 times out of 10, the credit card issuer will side on your behalf.\n\n4. Read return policies (proactively)\n\nTo save yourself time and hassle in the future, Leinbach recommends reading return policies before making a purchase. That\u2019s particularly important for large items such as furniture, which may be more of a logistical challenge to send back.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the return policy upfront is so important to any online purchase decision,\u201d Leinbach says.\n\nSimilarly, keep time frames in mind. Ask yourself questions like, when is the product expected to be delivered? Will you be home? Will you be able to inspect it before the return window passes?\n\nEven if a damaged product arrives on your porch before you\u2019ve done your due diligence, you can still follow the steps above to make things right. The good news? Taylor says many companies have favorable policies.\n\nIt\u2019ll just take a little extra work on your end to follow them.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Take these 4 actions if your delivery comes in less-than-optimal shape", "authors": ["Courtney Jespersen"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT101_nerd_d_ZG_20191010165334.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
