The deal also calls for handing the company over to trustees and giving future profits from OxyContin and drugs in development to creditors.\n\nBut some of the states that are holding out made it clear last week that they intend to object to the deal in bankruptcy court and seek to continue their lawsuits against members of the Sackler family in state courts.\n\n\u201cMy office is prepared to hold the Sackers accountable, regardless of whether or not Purdue declares bankruptcy,\u201d Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement last week.\n\nIt will be up to the Robert Drain, the federal bankruptcy judge in White Plains, New York, to sort out what happens now - including whether those state lawsuits against Sackler family members can continue. Even if he stops them, he could consider the claims they raise in his court.\n\nFor Purdue and the Sacklers, the effort revolves around getting more states to agree to the settlement, which could make a settlement more likely.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them,\u201d the families of late company owners Mortimer and Raymond Sackler said in their statement. \u201cWe intend to work constructively with all parties as we try to implement this settlement.\u201d\n\nThe Sackler family was listed by Forbes magazine in 2016 as one of the 20 wealthiest in the U.S. In a court filing last week, the New York attorney general\u2019s office contended that the family had transferred $1 billion to itself through a Swiss and other hidden bank accounts.\n\nAs some states agreed to the deal last week, others expressed frustration amount of money, saying the family should guarantee more - and that the tentative settlement didn\u2019t hold the family or company sufficiently accountable for their roles in causing an opioid crisis that has killed more than 400,000 Americans in the last two decades.\n\nIn court filings, the family and the company have pushed back against accusations that the company played a central role in causing the national crisis by overselling the benefits of its powerful prescription painkillers and downplaying the addiction risk. The company\u2019s drugs represent a small fraction of the prescription opioids shipped over the years - and most fatal overdoses have been linked to illegal opioids such as heroin and illicitly made fentanyl.\n\nSteve Miller, chairman of Purdue\u2019s board of directors, said on a conference call with reporters that an admission of wrongdoing is not part of the deal.\n\n\u201cThe alternative is to not settle but instead to resume the litigation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said as legal battles linger, the company\u2019s costs grow, leaving less for the plaintiffs in lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThe resumption of litigation would rapidly diminish all the resources of the company and would be lose-lose-lose all the way around,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever people might wish for is not on the table now.\u201d\n\nOne likely result of the company\u2019s filing is that it will be removed from the first federal trial over the toll of opioids, scheduled to start Oct. 21 in Cleveland. After a series of smaller settlements, claims remain in place against drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries along with drug distributors and one pharmacy chain, Walgreens.\n\n___\n\nMulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.\n\n___\n\nFollow Geoff Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its owners expressed sympathy but not responsibility for the nation's opioid crisis as the company filed for bankruptcy protection late Sunday night, part of a move to settle some 2,600 lawsuits - most from state and local governments.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Geoff Mulvihill"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/opioid_crisis_purdue_bankruptcy_73962_c0-210-3000-1959_s1770x1032.jpg?88f66e21f113924f6c3d8d2031208becd2d691b1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
