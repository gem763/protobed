The tiny space was usually filled with a who\u2019s who of Hollywood: Howard Hughes, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable. It wasn\u2019t just the decor, which capitalized on a 1930s fascination with the South Pacific\u2014it was also Donn\u2019s inventive new drinks. The drinks were based on rum, says Shannon Mustipher, the author of Tiki: Modern Tropical Cocktails. Cuba was nearby and willing to sell to the U.S., she says, \u201cso rum was the only spirit that had been readily available in the U.S. while distillers were not in operation.\u201d Plus, she points out, rum was cheap at the time\u2014a major selling point for a bar that opened during the Great Depression.\n\nDonn\u2019s cocktails blended multiple versions of rum, as well as multiple citrus juices, sweeteners, and spices, in complicated recipes that took their inspiration from traditional Caribbean punch recipes but added layers of flavor and nuance, according to Jeff \u201cBeachbum\u201d Berry, the owner of the tiki bar Latitude 29, in New Orleans. This was truly the second wave of American craft cocktails, Berry told Gastropod. \u201cNobody ever had drinks like this before,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody ever made drinks like this before.\u201d\n\nRead: A new golden age for the tiki bar\n\nBerry tasted his first classic tiki cocktail in the 1980s, when tiki bars had nearly disappeared and cocktails were limited to three-ingredient Harvey Wallbangers. Its balance and complexity stood out like a beacon of hope amid the sea of cheap spirits and sickly sweet mixers that were popular in that decade. But as he set out to drink more of these delicious tropical cocktails, Berry realized he had a problem: Most bartenders had no idea how to make Don the Beachcomber\u2019s original drinks correctly, and to make matters worse, Beach had written his original recipes in code.\n\nIn this episode, Berry tells Gastropod the story of how he decoded Beach\u2019s legendary concoctions and fueled today\u2019s tiki renaissance. And we do some detective work of our own to investigate tiki\u2019s rise, fall, and revival. Why did tiki bars peak in the 1950s and \u201960s, before nearly disappearing in the ensuing decades, and what brought about the revival today? Sarah Miller-Davenport, the author of Gateway State: Hawaii and the Cultural Transformation of American Empire, describes how Polynesian-style bars and restaurants allowed mid-century, middle-class white Americans to feel cosmopolitan and adventurous, in part by playing on racist stereotypes of Polynesian sexuality. These stereotypes are part of the reason Kalewa Correa, the Hawaii and Pacific America curator at the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center, says tiki bars make him, a native Hawaiian, uncomfortable\u2014that and the ubiquitous tikis, Polynesian-style carvings that invoke images of Polynesian gods. Listen in for the story of American tiki bars\u2014and for the debate over whether they\u2019re just another form of cultural appropriation.\n\nThis post appears courtesy of Gastropod.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
