That\u2019s happened a lot and it\u2019s still happening,\u201d Ballet Philippines President Kathleen Liechtenstein tells AFP.\n\nPrincipal dancer Denise Parungao, who started out as an $40-a month-apprentice at the troupe, says she relied on family to help pay her rent and understands why others left.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard because the salary before was really low and most of the dancers are not well off,\u201d the 25-year-old explains.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Filipinas have more heart\u2019 \u2013\n\nPart of the success of Ballet Philippines has been the determination of its performers.\n\nIn 2014, a fierce typhoon knocked out power and floods left the orchestra stranded miles from the venue, but with two hours before the show started \u2014 the organisation decided to carry on so as not to disappoint audiences who had travelled for the show.\n\n\u201cThe lights came back on as the people started to fill the Cultural Center of the Philippines lobby. It was a harrowing experience,\u201d recalls Liechtenstein, who says they had to use recorded music in place of live musicians.\n\n\u201cThe dancing was exquisitely unforgettable,\u201d she says, adding that the audience agreed \u2014 giving a roading standing ovation.\n\nThe same grit is evident down even when it comes to the use of dancing shoes.\n\nIn big name companies a performer might go through four pairs of ballet slippers in the course of a single performance.\n\n\u201cIn Ballet Philippines, a dancer wears (a pair) for a whole month. They put glue, they varnish, do everything just to make them last,\u201d Parungao says.\n\nShe buys an extra five pairs a year out of her own pocket to make sure her footwear does not disintegrate during a live performance.\n\n\u201cFilipinas really have more heart in doing this\u2026 we give our whole selves to it,\u201d Parungao adds.\n\nUnlike in Russia and the West, there is no national programme for spotting dancing talent in the Philippines and few get an early start \u2014 those that succeed must battle to make their mark.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Love to entertain\u2019 \u2013\n\nCarlo Pacis, a former senior soloist at the Hong Kong Ballet who briefly returned to Manila to choreograph \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d for Ballet Philippines, believes its dancers\u2019 strengths are not just physical.\n\n\u201cWe do not only dance: we embody the roles that we are tasked to portray. We love to act, we love to entertain,\u201d he says.\n\nBallet Philippines declined to give its annual funding, but sources in the arts world said its four to six productions per year cost at least $100,000 each.\n\nThough it has always had free use of the national cultural centre\u2019s facilities, the company only gets about $40,000 a year in government backing.\n\nFor the rest it must rely on seat sales and sponsorships, as well as donations: The board of directors, a who\u2019s who of the country\u2019s wealthiest families, collectively put up 30 percent of the company\u2019s annual budget.\n\nFounded in 1969 by pioneering Filipina contemporary dancer and choreographer Alice Reyes with help from Imelda Marcos \u2014 whose husband Ferdinand ruled the country as a dictator until his ouster in 1986 \u2014 the company was one of Asia\u2019s first.\n\nWith Reyes still with the company as artistic director, it remains on a short list of developing nations that have their own ballet troupes including Vietnam, China, Cuba and Brazil.\n\nTo open its 50th season in August, principal dancer Evgeny Ivanchenko and first soloist Elena Evseeva of Russia\u2019s famed Mariinsky Ballet, previously the Kirov Ballet, starred alongside local dancers in the Filipino troupe\u2019s \u201cSwan Lake\u201d gala night.\n\nThe production evoked the glitter of Ballet Philippines\u2019 first decade, when the likes of legends Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Patrick Bissell danced for the company in Manila.\n\nThe troupe\u2019s reputation continues to pack a punch.\n\nChris Millado, Cultural Center of the Philippine\u2019s artistic director, says: \u201cIt is one of the best in Asia.\u201d", "description": "Manila (AFP) \u2013 From fierce typhoons and tight budgets to losing its dancers to cruise ships and theme parks, Ballet Philippines has weathered almost", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/070022_fierce-typhoons-tight-budgets-losing-its-dancers-cruise-ships-theme-parks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
