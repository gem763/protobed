And far too often it\u2019s entirely unjustified.\n\nAnker\u2019s gorgeous new Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro wireless earbuds are an exception. Retailing at $150, they\u2019re perhaps the most compelling buds in their price-point, boasting excellent sound performance, wireless charging, and impressive battery life.\n\nAlthough we\u2019ve been impressed with Anker\u2019s previous efforts in the truly wireless space, we believe this is the company\u2019s best effort yet. Read on to find out why.\n\nDesign\n\nTo match its name, the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro has a refined, more aspirational aesthetic. This attribute is particularly apparent when looking at the stylish pebble-shaped case.\n\nUnlike other earbud cases, which use a hinge mechanism to open, the Liberty 2 Pro slides open with a gentle press of the thumb. In the grand scheme of things, this is relatively small design quirk, but it makes the buds feel more premium than their price would otherwise suggest. Furthermore, in my experience, it also makes the buds less prone to fall out when inelegantly thrown into a backpack or handbag.\n\nRegular readers of TNW know that we review a lot of Anker products. For the past few years, we\u2019ve continually griped about the company\u2019s apparent reluctance to adopt the new USB-C standard, which has gradually replaced MicroUSB. Although MicroUSB has served consumers well for the past decade, it\u2019s retirement is long overdue.\n\nFortunately, the Soundcore Liberty 2 breaks that bad habit. It includes a full USB-C charging port, which comes concealed behind a small protective flap. This addition is a huge step forward, allowing users to charge their earbuds with the same cable they use with their laptop or smartphone.\n\nAs we\u2019ve come to expect with Anker\u2019s audio gear, the buds have a muted, somewhat conservative design. But what they lack in flair, they more than compensate in terms of comfort.\n\nThey also hold their position well. In our experience testing the buds, they didn\u2019t once fall out of this reviewer\u2019s ears, even when performing moderate physical activity.\n\nPerformance\n\nWith the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro, it\u2019s evident Anker has tried to tick off most items on people\u2019s wishlists.\n\nLike the latest-and-greatest AirPods, the Liberty 2 Pro comes with wireless charging. Drop them on a charging pad, and you\u2019ll quickly see the device\u2019s power LEDs start to oscillate. The Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro also comes with fast charging, allowing you to get two hours of listening time from just ten minutes plugged in.\n\nThe latter feature is almost definitely a result of the long-overdue switch to USB-C. Just one fast-charging standard supports MicroUSB, and that\u2019s the relatively obscure MediaTek\u2019s Pump Express 2.0. In comparison, several quick charging standards support USB-C, including Qualcomm\u2019s Quick Charge, MediaTek\u2019s Pump Express 3.0 and 4.0, and Huawei SuperCharge.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about battery life. Users can expect 8 hours of continuous listening, augmented by the charging case, which offers a further 32 hours of battery life. By the standards of wireless earbuds, that\u2019s exceptional.\n\nIn comparison, Apple\u2019s AirPods 2 provides a mere 5 hours of continuous listening, plus 24 hours of juice from the case.\n\nSo, let\u2019s move swiftly on to audio performance. I was impressed with the Soundcore Liberty 2\u2019s ability to mitigate against external noises, which is thanks to the addition of Qualcomm\u2019s CVC 8.0 noise cancellation technology. Although it wasn\u2019t as effective as the noise cancelling on the venerable Sony WH-1000MX3, it held its own against the hum created by passing cars.\n\nBy default, the Soundcore Liberty 2 pro has a slightly bassy profile, which lends itself favorably to R&B, hip-hop, and dubstep tracks, like Skrillex\u2019s 2011 track, \u201cScary Monsters and Nice Sprites,\u201d or Billie Eilish\u2019s hit \u201cBad Guy.\u201d\n\nUsers can also tweak the equalizer settings via the HearID feature on the Soundcore app, available for Android and iOS.\n\nThis tool comes with dozens of presets geared towards specific genres, like classical and dance music, to the spoken word. Most users won\u2019t use this, but it\u2019s certainly a feature that\u2019s nice to have, and offers more control than typically is available.\n\nWho is the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro for?\n\nThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro headphones are excellent and compare favorably against offerings from more premium rivals, like RHA\u2019s fantastic TrueConnect earbuds. Crucially, it\u2019s got pretty much everything you\u2019d want from a pair of mid-range earbuds.\n\nDo they sound good? Check. Can they filter out outside noises? Yeah. Is the battery life any good? Yep. Does it have USB-C and wireless charging? Hell yes.\n\nAnd most impressively, Anker has managed to achieve this at a relatively modest price point. As I mentioned earlier, the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro costs $150, which is nothing short of a steal. Compare that to Bose\u2019s SoundSport Free earbuds, which retails at $200, or Sony\u2019s WF-1000MX3, which costs $230.\n\nThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro is an absolute revelation. For the time being, it\u2019s my default answer to the question: \u201cwhat wireless earbuds should I buy?\u201d If you want to get a pair yourself, hit up the Soundcore website here.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
