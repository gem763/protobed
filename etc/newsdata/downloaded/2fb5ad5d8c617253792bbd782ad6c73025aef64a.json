High pension returns of prior years might suggest hope for future market recovery, but a deeper analysis reveals that these low returns are perhaps the new normal. If states and municipalities don\u2019t lower their expectations regarding asset gains, future retirees could be out of luck \u2014 and taxpayers would still be on the hook for accumulated debt.\n\nPublic pension funds in the U.S. are generally structured so that their participants are guaranteed a certain amount of income upon retirement. To achieve this, employers invest their assets (stock, bonds and annuities) in a portfolio that\u2019s expected to generate sufficient returns to cover future pension obligations.\n\nSo when the portfolio returns less than expected, i.e., the plans don\u2019t have the money they were anticipating, the responsibility of making up for the lost income falls on the plan\u2019s sponsor \u2014 in this case, the government. And the government finds those additional funds by raising taxes or cutting services. That\u2019s why even small differences matter. In 2019, state and municipal retirement systems received an average 6.2% in investment returns from their portfolio \u2014 short of their average expected returns of 7.3%. And while that 1% difference may appear minor, the long-term effects of this shortfall is significant because of its compounding effects.\n\nAlthough the higher returns of prior years \u2060\u2014 7.7% in 2018 and 11.9% in 2017 on average across all pension plans \u2060\u2014 might make this year\u2019s drop look like a random glitch, examining recent fund performance reveals that this is a part of an emerging trend. Between 2001 and 2016, public pension plans averaged a 5.5% annual return.\n\nIn response, pension plans lowered their expected returns from an average of 8% to about 7.3% over roughly the same time frame. Despite these adjustments, market research firms forecast that the next decade is still likely to see even lower returns than the adjusted expectations.\n\nThis means that even though they lowered expectations, they didn\u2019t lower it enough, to actual market experience. Why didn\u2019t they go all the way?\n\nThe reluctance to make appropriate changes stems from the lingering confidence from the so-called \u201cgolden era\u201d of exceptional asset returns over the past 30 years \u2014 the product of low inflation, high global GDP growth and higher corporate profits generated by emerging markets. Dot-com and financial crisis withstanding, markets were doing exceptionally well between 1985 and 2014. But changes to the global economy, such as the aging population and slowdown in industrial growth, negatively affected economic growth and caused returns to fall below prior decades\u2060 \u2014 a trend that will likely continue in the years to come.\n\nPension boards also got false confidence from the fact that most pension plans in the U.S. were fully funded until 2001. So, some pension funds expanded benefits to workers without properly funding the changes (after all, what could go wrong spending money you don\u2019t have?). That mistake has contributed to challenges today.\n\nPublic pensions currently have an estimated 1.5 trillion in unfunded liabilities, meaning they have that much less than they owe in retirement obligations. And because of the anticipated low-market returns, this already enormous funding gap is likely to grow if pension plans don\u2019t make proper changes.\n\nTo put the magnitude of the problem in context, roughly 21 million people are dependent on state and local pension plans for their retirement. These are teachers, firefighters, and police officers who serve their communities and are expecting the pension benefits they\u2019ve been promised will be there when they retire.\n\nThe majority of plans have yet to recover from the 2008 crisis, which puts plan sponsors in a tough position, because these benefits are frequently guaranteed by the state constitution, meaning they will have to be paid. Adjusting investment return expectations is essential to keeping promises to retirees, ensuring future competitive benefits and preventing the crowding out of other public services over the long term.\n\nAt the end of the day, the government is footing the bill for the unrealized investment returns, which leaves Americans on the hook for pension debt. Whether through tax increases or budget cuts, taxpayers will continue to feel the pressure of pension debt if no changes are made. Lowering investment return assumptions should be the first step in putting pension plan back on the path to full funding.\n\nJen Sidorova is a Young Voices contributor and a policy analyst at the Reason Foundation.
