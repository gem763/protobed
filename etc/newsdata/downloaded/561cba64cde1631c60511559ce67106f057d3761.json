The German president expressed gratitude to Poles for the gestures of forgiveness Poland has bestowed in return.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

I affirm our lasting responsibility.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after the German invasion, the Soviet army invaded Poland from the east, putting the country under a dual occupation that came with atrocities committed by two invaders. By the war\u2019s end nearly six years later, about 6 million Polish citizens had been killed, more than half of them Jews.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda recalled Poland\u2019s immense suffering and he appealed to those assembled not to close their eyes now to imperial tendencies and border changes imposed through force.\n\nDuda cited aggression against Georgia and Ukraine, and though he didn\u2019t name Russia, it was clear he found that country at fault as the aggressor.\n\n\u201cRecently in Europe we are dealing with a return of imperialist tendencies, with attempts to change borders by force, with aggression against countries,\u201d Duda said. \u201cTurning a blind eye is not the recipe for preserving peace. It is a simple way to embolden aggressive personalities, a simple way to, in fact, give consent to further attacks.\u201d\n\nGerman president had a modern-day warning of his own \u2014 about the dangers of nationalism \u2014 and described European unity as a guarantee for peace in the future.\n\nPolish authorities didn\u2019t invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend anniversary events because of Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea and support for separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussia\u2019s recent rehabilitation of the Stalinist era, and a pact Soviet leader Josef Stalin made with Hitler that led to Poland\u2019s dismemberment in 1939, were apparently also behind the decisions not to invite Putin. That represented a change from 10 years ago, when Putin was invited amid attempts to thaw relations between the West and Russia at the time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had originally been scheduled to attend the event, but canceled as Hurricane Dorian barreled toward the U.S. Pence spoke on behalf of the United States in Warsaw.\n\n\u201cWhile the hearts of every American are with our fellow citizens in the path of a massive storm, today we remember how the gathering storm of the 20th century broke into warfare and invasion followed by unspeakable hardship and heroism of the Polish people,\u201d he said.\n\nPence said the Polish people \u201cnever lost hope\u201d and \u201cnever gave in to despair.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ccharacter, faith, and determination of the Polish people made all the difference,\u201d Pence said. \u201cYour oppressors tried to break you, but Poland could not be broken.\u201d\n\nDuring the observances in Warsaw, church bells tolled across a capital that German forces razed to the ground decades ago. Polish and foreign leaders laid wreaths, and one by one rang a bell in memory.\n\nThe observances started at 4:40 a.m. at the sites of the first German attacks \u2014 Wielun, a defenseless town, and minutes later on the Westerplatte Peninsula in Gdansk.\n\nIn Wielun, Steinmeier also voiced remorse, which Duda said provided \u201cmoral satisfaction.\u201d He addressed his German counterpart.\n\n\u201cMr. President, thank you for your presence and your attitude,\u201d Duda said. \u201cI can see a man who has come with humility, a bowed head in order to pay homage \u2026 to share the pain.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Frans Timmermans, a top European Union official, led an event on Westerplatte Peninsula, the Baltic Coast site where Polish troops put up resistance to fight the war\u2019s first battle.\n\n\u201cEighty years ago, unspeakable horrors were unleashed on the Polish population, unspeakable horrors that we need to remember to prevent them from recurring in Europe,\u201d said Timmermans, the first vice president of the European Commission. \u201cCan you imagine in this gathering that every fifth person sitting and standing here would suddenly disappear? This is what happened to the Polish nation at the hands of cruel Nazis who lost every understanding of humanity.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Germany's president expressed deep remorse for the suffering his nation inflicted on Poland and the rest of Europe during World War II.", "authors": ["Monika Scislowska", "Vanessa Gera"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/german-president-world-war-ii-anniversary.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
