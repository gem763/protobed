Now, he and his staff help feed four times that. Before, the clientele was mostly folks struggling to pay rents that shot up during the oil boom. Today, it\u2019s often men and women who were living high before the bust. Sometimes, they pull up in shiny pickups purchased just a year or two ago.\n\n\u201cYou never know who\u2019s going to walk through your door,\u201d said Edwards, the food bank\u2019s director. \u201cIndividuals that have degrees and education and skills \u2014 but the jobs just aren\u2019t what they were.\u201d\n\nOnce the booming heart of the country\u2019s energy industry, the little city of 75,000 in northeastern Alberta has become a showcase for the debt troubles many Canadians are facing. Fat paycheques and generous overtime earlier this decade fuelled big spending on customized pickups and million-dollar homes. With work drying up, the bill has come due.\n\nConsumer insolvency filings in the Fort McMurray district climbed 39 per cent in 2018, the largest percentage increase in Canada, federal data show. Claims against property, the first step in the foreclosure process, surged almost tenfold over the past three years, according to court records. The city\u2019s 90-day delinquency rate on non-mortgage loans climbed to 1.75 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 1.12 per cent nationally, according to Equifax Canada.\n\nThe five-year slump that\u2019s cut oil prices in half since 2014 has been a driver in the bust. What piled on the pain was a crippling shortage of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation, a massive reserve of crude-laden oilsands. Plans for new lines have been squelched or stalled by court challenges from an array of opponents, including U.S. activists who view the oilsands as a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d that will one day unleash a climate catastrophe.\n\nStewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of Canada\u2019s federal election later this month. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and pledges to remove regulations Prime Minister Justin Trudeau implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.\n\nIn May, after five years at Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s Fort Hills oilsands mine, Steve Richardson was let go, like many others in the industry.\n\nRichardson earned around six figures most years as a heavy equipment operator. For about 10 months, he commuted from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with Suncor paying for most of his flights and putting him up in a camp near the work site. He\u2019d dig trenches for 14 days, then go home for seven.\n\nAfter the travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family to a small town about a seven-hour drive from Fort Mac, so he could keep the job. Now he\u2019s doing short-term work and making economies where he can, such as cancelling his family\u2019s cable subscription.\n\n\u201cI spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be,\u201d Richardson, 42, said. He\u2019s thankful he resisted buying boats or taking vacations on credit, as many of his friends did. \u201cI never got into all the toys. I\u2019m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn\u2019t have to sell everything off like some other people. I\u2019ve seen a lot of that. It\u2019s like a fire sale.\u201d\n\nThe energy business has long been core to the local economy. Commercial production got off the ground in the 1940s, but the oil was always a devil to recover. It\u2019s mired in a sludge that has to be tediously pumped out or strip-mined in open pits. Either way, the process is technologically challenging.\n\nThe potential, though, is staggering. With 165.4 billion barrels, these oilsands are the world\u2019s third-largest proven reserve, trailing only those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested $210.1 billion (US$157.7 billion), more than last year\u2019s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOver those 10 years, oilsands output more than doubled, to 2.2 million barrels a day. Canada shot up from the world\u2019s eighth-largest oil-producing nation to the fifth-largest, overtaking Iran, Mexico and Norway.\n\nIt was a heady time.\n\nTax revenue and corporate sponsorships paid for a revamp of the Fort McMurray International Airport, improvements to schools, top-notch hockey facilities and a gleaming new recreation centre, where Carrie Underwood was a recent headliner.\n\nThe city\u2019s population doubled as workers crowded in from around the country, sending rents and home prices surging and prompting a cascade of typical boomtown challenges, from crazy traffic to crowded schools. Companies, desperate for labour, threw six-figure salaries at low-skill jobs and covered commuting costs for roughnecks and people from as far away as Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast. Median annual household incomes more than doubled from 2001 to 2011, to about $181,000.\n\nThen oil prices tanked. The pipeline plans stalled. International giants, including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, ConocoPhillips and Total SA sold off their major oilsands assets. Capital investments are on track to decline for a fifth straight year to an estimated $12 billion this year, about one-third of the 2014 level, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.\n\nSeveral operators \u2014 Suncor, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and a few others \u2014 are still active and generally profitable. But they\u2019ve managed that by cutting costs, including, of course, that of labour.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t getting the overtime that they used to get, or they\u2019re not getting any overtime at all,\u201d said Sandra Landry, an insolvency trustee at MNP Ltd.\n\nIf things weren\u2019t bad enough when oil bottomed around US$26 a barrel in early 2016, the largest wildfire in recent history swept through the Fort Mac area that May. It forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 people, destroyed almost 2,000 homes and caused about $3.7 billion in insured losses, making it the country\u2019s costliest natural disaster.\n\n\u201cThe housing market is down, there\u2019s the economic downturn and there\u2019s still the recovery from the fire,\u201d said Don Scott, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. Home prices remain 44 per cent below the recent peak.\n\nSean O\u2019Byrne moved to Fort Mac from Grande Prairie, Alberta, after the fire to open a branch of a friend\u2019s siding business to repair damaged houses. That work dried up in November. Now he\u2019s selling cars, making far less than the $1,000 a day he could rake in with the siding business; customers at the General Motors dealership are no longer trading in for new models every two years. He and his wife have cut back on travel and moved to a cheaper apartment closer to their children\u2019s school, saving $900 in rent, he said while sipping coffee in a Tim Hortons doughnut shop facing a forested area, where charred trees stick out among new growth.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t spending money like they used to,\u201d he said.\n\nThey likely won\u2019t be in the near future. There are only a few projects on the horizon that would create many new jobs. Teck Resources Ltd.\u2019s proposed $20-billion Frontier mine is in the early stages of the regulatory-approval process. Imperial Oil Ltd., a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corp., has put its long-planned $2.6-billion Aspen mine on hold, waiting to see if the pipeline situation improves.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many bets being laid that it will. More than a few folks would rather it not. Since the frenzy died down, traffic has returned to normal, in part because the oil money helped build a new bridge, over the Athabasca river. The unemployment rate, which skyrocketed to around 10 per cent in 2016, has settled down to 6.3 per cent mostly a function of workers decamping for more promising prospects.\n\n\u201cThat massive boom and gold-rush mentality that took place \u2014 I would rather not relive that,\u201d said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive officer of Cenovus, adding the entire industry has learned the benefits of measured growth.\n\nThese days, the company will only consider expansion projects that will be profitable with the benchmark U.S. oil price at US$45 a barrel, about US$10 less than the current level. Some oilsands projects undertaken a decade ago required US$100 a barrel to break even.\n\nJohn Hickey is also content with the slowdown. A mechanic who works on used oil-industry vehicles, he lost his house in the wildfire. Two years ago, a builder quoted him $500,000. The offers keep moving down, and he\u2019s waiting for one to get to $200,000 or so before going ahead.\n\nIn the meantime, he\u2019s sharing a one-bedroom condo with a friend, sleeping in a tent in the living room to give himself a bit of privacy. He still has work and has always lived within his means, a lesson for places like Fort Mac that can see the money go as quickly as it came, he said.\n\nToo many, he said, \u201cmade a lifestyle based on an economy that wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Fort McMurray has become a showcase for the debt troubles many Canadians are facing", "authors": ["Kevin Orland", "Chris Fournier", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/food-bank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
