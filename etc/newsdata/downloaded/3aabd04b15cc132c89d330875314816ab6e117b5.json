But as the government has taken steps to fulfill this task, some in the commercial space industry are crying foul, arguing that the administration is poised to make changes that may make regulations more demanding than they were before.\n\nTo launch a rocket, companies must get a series of licenses, including one from the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA isn\u2019t so much focused on what a company is launching, but it mostly deems a rocket safe to the uninvolved public and property. Currently, companies must go through a series of steps to get this license. But in February 2018, Trump\u2019s National Space Council proposed making this process easier and more efficient after hearing input from the commercial space industry.\n\nThat\u2019s because the private space world is seeing a growth spurt. Just a decade ago, the FAA was only approving a handful of non-government launches a year. For 2019, the agency expects to issue 31 rocket licenses for vehicles going to space and returning from space, such as cargo capsules that docked with the International Space Station. The FAA estimates that its workload has gone up by 1,000 percent, according to Wayne Monteith, the FAA\u2019s associate administrator for commercial space transportation. Monteith says the agency is \u201cworking diligently to keep pace with that growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cwe walked away saying, \u2018this is no better than what we had.\u2019 In fact, I think it\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\nTo meet the administration's goal of streamlining paperwork, the FAA came up with a newly proposed method for launch licensing. Since April 15th, the FAA sought insight from the public and the commercial space industry to get their thoughts on the proposed changes. But members of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation (CSF), a nonprofit that represents various companies within the private space industry, says that the new licensing rules would actually increase the amount of prescriptive regulations that companies would have to follow to go to space.\n\nCSF representatives note the irony of the situation since the organization and its companies were the ones to ask for changes in the first place. Its members even made recommendations for how to update the rules. \u201cThe FAA took them, and they went and started formulating,\u201d Eric Stallmer, president of CSF, tells The Verge. \u201cAnd it came back, and we read it, and we tried to digest it. And then we walked away saying, \u2018This is no better than what we had.\u2019 In fact, I think it\u2019s worse. It doesn\u2019t answer the mail at all.\u201d\n\nOne aspect of the current launch licensing regime that\u2019s been frustrating companies is the inability to transfer a license from one spaceport to another. If a company successfully flew a vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida, it would have to go through the entire launch licensing process again to launch the same rocket out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. \u201cYou know the government\u2019s figured out how to honor driver\u2019s licenses across state lines,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said during the second meeting of the National Space Council in February 2018. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t do the same for rockets.\u201d Additionally, different types of launch vehicles \u2014 from expendable ones to rockets that are saved after each launch \u2014 have different requirements, and the industry wanted more general rules that covered as many vehicles as possible.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t provide any greater safety measure mechanisms than what the companies are already using.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the FAA\u2019s new rules do away with these issues. They allow licenses to transfer from one spaceport to another, and the rules are meant to be applied more broadly to all types of vehicles that go to space. But there are a few requirements that the FAA has added in that aren\u2019t sitting well with CSF. One revolves around new flight software requirements that rockets would have to adhere to. CSF argues that these changes would dictate exactly how companies would have to design their software and test it in order to fly.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t provide any greater safety measure mechanisms than what the companies are already using,\u201d Stallmer argues. \u201cAnd again, it\u2019s very prescriptive. SpaceX uses their own software that is the industry leader for safety. So, why would you go to a contractor to provide software services? In simple terms, it adds another step to the process that doesn\u2019t need to be there.\u201d\n\nAnother big point of contention revolves around proving a rocket\u2019s flight safety \u2014 that it won\u2019t bring harm to the uninvolved public or property. Right now, companies use one type of calculation to determine their vehicle\u2019s safety standards, but now the FAA is proposing using a new type of calculation \u2014 one that CSF argues is purely theoretical and hasn\u2019t been tested before. The organization claims that the cost of implementing this new calculation may be higher than smaller startups can handle. The only alternative to the calculation is to test a rocket nearly 3,000 times with zero failures, says CSF.\n\n\u201cThe comments have not been universal or unanimous that they are problematic.\u201d\n\nThe Verge asked Monteith to provide justifications for the changes during last week\u2019s roundtable. \u201cI think \u2018justification\u2019 is a little bit pejorative, because the suggestion would be that the rules that we have today are perfect,\u201d he replied. While he did not provide specifics, he did argue that there are options for companies to meet the requirements for licensing if they don\u2019t want to follow the exact guidelines laid out by the FAA. The FAA lists 17 possible workarounds \u2014 known as advisory circulars \u2014 for meeting the new licensing requirements. But the agency has yet to publish the details for 16 of these circulars. Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-MS) recently called out these lack of details when commenting to the FAA as well.\n\nMonteith noted that the private space industry isn\u2019t in total agreement about the proposed rules. \u201cThe comments have not been universal or unanimous that they are problematic,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to absolutely have to look at it and evaluate whether or not we got it right.\u201d The companies that have expressed the most support for the new rules are the industry\u2019s legacy players are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and the United Launch Alliance. \u201cBroadly speaking, we are supportive of AST\u2019s efforts and the content of the NPRM,\u201d the companies wrote in a joint statement when they submitted their comments. \u201cWe do not support an indefinite rulemaking process, but would like AST to bring it to conclusion as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCSF, on the other hand, represents the newer players in the field, like SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Virgin Orbit, Relativity, and more. The organization argues that the new rules will have a heavier burden on these younger companies, which have been launching commercial missions much more frequently. ULA often conducts national security launches or missions for NASA, which do not require a commercial launch license from the FAA. \u201cFor some of these companies that don\u2019t really need FAA licenses and haven\u2019t had an FAA licensed launch since April 2017, why are they so concerned about these rules that really don\u2019t apply to them?\u201d says Stallmer, referring to ULA\u2019s last commercial launch.\n\nULA argues otherwise. \u201cAs the nation\u2019s most experienced commercial launch provider, we know the importance of both efficiency and safety,\u201d the company emailed in a statement to The Verge. \u201cThe proposed rule allows for the development of innovative approaches to satisfy the FAA requirements while keeping public safety as the #1 priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cif we identify something that fundamentally missed the mark, there is a process for us to readdress that.\u201d\n\nAfter expressing his displeasure during a July 25th House hearing, Stallmer says he met with Monteith to go over CSF\u2019s grievances and that the FAA has been much more amenable to their requests. Monteith notes that supplemental drafts could be added to the proposal before the final rules are published. \u201cWe have to balance all of the inputs that we get,\u201d Monteith said during the roundtable. \u201cBut I will tell you as part of the rule-making process, if we identify something that fundamentally missed the mark, there is a process for us to readdress that.\u201d\n\nThat public comment period for the new launch licensing rules ended on Monday, August 19th. For now, Stallmer says he\u2019s treating the new rules just as they are: drafts that could change in the year ahead. \u201cIs it a perfect product? No,\u201d says Stallmer. \u201cAnd they know that. We know that. And this is an opportunity for us to make it a more perfect product.\u201d", "description": "To address the rapid growth of the commercial space industry, the Trump administration has vowed to streamline the licensing process for rocket launches.
