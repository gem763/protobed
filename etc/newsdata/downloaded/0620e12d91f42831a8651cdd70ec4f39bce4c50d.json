REUTERS/Steve Marcus\n\nNine of the leading candidates gathered in Las Vegas for an all-day forum on gun safety, a day after the city marked two years since it suffered the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which killed 58 people.\n\nThe event - co-hosted by the gun safety advocacy groups Giffords and the student-led March For Our Lives - represented an effort to keep gun violence at the forefront of the campaign, despite the looming specter of an impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for this hell to be visited upon your community for you to be activated for this fight,\u201d said U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who spoke passionately about witnessing firsthand the scourge of gun violence in his low-income, neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey. \u201cIt is a life-and-death issue for people in communities like mine.\u201d\n\nThe candidates\u2019 forceful words provided the latest evidence that the politics around gun control have shifted following a spate of high-profile mass shootings in recent years.\n\nMost of the Democrats were broadly in agreement on certain policies, including universal background checks, \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow courts to remove guns from dangerous people and an assault-style weapons ban. But the back-to-back appearances also exposed some fissures among the Democrats over other ideas.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading most public polls, released a gun reform proposal hours before the event that called for banning online sales and repealing a law that gives gun makers special protections against civil liability.\n\n\u201cImagine if the same law existed for drug companies that existed for gun companies,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut Biden does not support some other candidates\u2019 proposals, such as a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons or a national licensing requirement.\n\nIn his remarks, Booker - the first presidential candidate to call for licensing earlier this year - noted most people already support the concept.\n\n\u201cYou should not be a nominee from our party that can seriously stand in front of urban places and say, \u2018I will protect you,\u2019 if you don\u2019t believe in gun licensing,\u201d Booker said.\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has made gun safety the central cause of his campaign since a gunman murdered 22 people in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, two months ago, echoed his vow to force people to give up \u201cweapons of war\u201d through buybacks.\n\nRelated Coverage Biden would ban assault rifles, but not force owners to sell them\n\nSeveral candidates spoke about the particular toll gun violence has on communities of color, as well as the psychological damage done to children fearful of school shootings.\n\nU.S. Senator Kamala Harris said teachers had told her they have lollipops on hand to keep the youngest students quiet in the event of an attack.\n\n\u201cThis is traumatizing our children,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Washington, the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate has shown little appetite for new limits. Trump, whose 2016 campaign was bolstered by millions of dollars from the National Rifle Association, has offered mixed signals.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump blamed the Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation for a lack of progress on gun safety, a claim that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren decried as an \u201calternative reality.\u201d\n\nSeveral candidates sought to tie gun safety to the broader themes of their campaigns.\n\nWarren said gun violence has gone unchecked for the same reason that climate change and drug prices remained unaddressed in Washington: powerful companies have bought off politicians.\n\n\u201cYou have to stop and ask yourself the question: What is so badly broken in this democracy that something that the overwhelming majority of Americans want to see done doesn\u2019t get done,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the answer is, there\u2019s too much power in the hands of the gun industry and the gun lobby.\u201d\n\nBiden, who has argued that defeating Trump is the most important thing for Democrats to accomplish, said he expected new laws would pass easily once \u201cwe get this guy out of office.\u201d\n\nAndrew Yang, the entrepreneur whose signature proposal is giving every American $1,000 a month, argued that universal basic income would help ameliorate much of the economic distress that contributes to gun violence.\n\nThe forum also gave candidates an opportunity to push back against arguments that their positions are impractical or politically untenable.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said the country has already established that some limits on weapons are legal and appropriate.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\n\u201cAnybody can have a water balloon; nobody can have a Predator drone,\u201d he said. \u201cSomewhere we\u2019re going to draw a line. And all we\u2019re saying ... is that we need to draw the line a lot tighter.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who had been scheduled to appear, was forced to cancel after his hospitalization for a procedure to clear a blocked artery.", "description": "Democratic presidential contenders on Wednesday vowed to pursue far-reaching limits on guns, tackling an issue that has become a top concern for their party's voters.", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436374394&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911PK"}
