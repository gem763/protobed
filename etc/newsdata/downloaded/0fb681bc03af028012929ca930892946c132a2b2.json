Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 at least publicly \u2013 aren\u2019t taking aim at each other.\n\nThat\u2019s been the case since the two quietly met last December \u2013 before they launched their White House bids \u2013 and agreed not to take jabs at each other on the campaign trail.\n\nIt remained the case on Monday, as both of the progressive and populist standard bearers in the party refrained from criticizing each other while they both campaigned in neighboring New Hampshire, the state holding the first primary in the presidential race.\n\n2020 DEMS MAKE HARD SELL FOR ORGANIZED LABOR, BUT UNIONS IN NO RUSH TO ENDORSE\n\n\u201cBernie and I have been friends for many, many years, long before I ever got into politics, and I don\u2019t see any reason that that should change,\u201d Warren told reporters after being asked if she was going to end the non-aggression pact with Sanders.\n\nAnd, Warren repeated another line she often has used, saying that rather than jabbing at Sanders, she would continue to \u201cget out every day and try to meet as many voters as I can and talk about why I\u2019m in this race, to talk about what\u2019s broken, to talk about my plans to fix it and to talk about how I\u2019m building a grassroots movement to get it done. I think that\u2019s what voters want to hear - what\u2019s your positive message.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign said it drew roughly 800 people to an outdoor house party during a rainy afternoon in New Hampshire\u2019s Seacoast region.\n\nAbout 90 minutes west of Hampton Falls, Sanders was holding a town hall in Peterborough. His campaign highlighted that more than 800 were in attendance, according to the fire marshal.\n\nEarlier, Sanders marched in the Milford Labor Day Parade, the largest annual Labor Day parade in New Hampshire. He was the only candidate marching in this year's parade.\n\nAsked by Fox News if he was disappointed that none of his rivals joined him, Sanders passed on the opportunity to take aim at any of his opponents. Instead, he said, \u201cask them.\u201d\n\nSanders - who crushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary in what was basically a two-candidate race - then touted that \u201cwe\u2019re going to spend a lot of time in New Hampshire. We did well in New Hampshire last time, but we\u2019re not taking anything for granted.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE\n\nSanders \u2013 as he has throughout his second White House bid \u2013 refrained from calling New Hampshire a \u201cmust win\u201d state.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously a very important state, as is Iowa, South Carolina. We\u2019re working hard. We\u2019re going to do many, many rallies around the state, and I\u2019m feeling pretty good,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut, a veteran Granite State-based political scientist said the first primary state\u2019s crucial to both candidates and predicted the gloves may soon come off.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire is a must-win-or-place state for Senators Sanders and Warren,\u201d said Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs and a political science professor at New England College. \u201cFor both candidates, there is no better home-field advantage in the early states than the Granite State.\u201d\n\nPointing to the upcoming third round of presidential primary debates, he explained, \u201cWith the end of summer, I expect we will see the end of collegiality between the two leading progressive candidates. The September debate should feature fireworks as both begin to look ahead to fall and winter in New Hampshire.\u201d", "description": "They\u2019re battling for second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democrats' race for the presidential nomination,\u00a0but Sens.
