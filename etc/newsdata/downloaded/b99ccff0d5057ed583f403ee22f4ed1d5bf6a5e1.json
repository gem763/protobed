Your under-arm, that\u2019s been extremely uncomfortable for days has just burst everywhere.\n\nI have a rare skin disease called Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). HS is a debilitating, inflammatory skin condition which appears as boil-like abscesses on a large proportion of my body, which sometimes burst.\n\nMy girlfriends \u2013 being the absolute angels that they are \u2013 came to my rescue, handing me tissues and running around to try and help me because they knew that if I moved it would make things considerably worse.\n\nIn my peripheral vision, I saw a woman \u2013 a complete stranger \u2013 glaring at me and sniggerring to her partner. Callously and without remorse or any consideration for my feelings, she looked straight at me and called me \u2018disgusting\u2019.\n\nI would love to put an end to the stigma, the judgement, the embarrassment and the shame (Picture: PhilYeomans/BNPS)\n\nI was hurt and extremely saddened by her response.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019m resilient. The lady who labelled me that day has actually done me a favour, she\u2019s helped to make me stronger.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for her on-the-spot judgment of me, labeling me as disgusting for something I have no control over, I wouldn\u2019t be sat here today writing about my life, trying to raise awareness of the horrendous condition I live with day in and day out.\n\nThe disease can range from mild to severe, with the latter meaning there is lots of tracking and tunneling under the skin, leaving constant draining and leakage.\n\nMy HS wears me down, physically and mentally (Picture: The Bad Skin Clinic)\n\nIt covers my body from my armpits to my legs, groin, bottom, sides, belly, under my breasts and many other areas.\n\nI suffer from the severe form of it and have done since I was seven-years-old.\n\nMy HS wears me down, physically and mentally. It\u2019s exhausting, the severe pain that comes with HS is debilitating and chronic.\n\nThere are some days I feel that I physically cannot get out of bed but I will not let my condition define me. Nor will I let that woman\u2019s comments \u2013 or anyone else\u2019s for that matter \u2013 break my spirit.\n\nThere are some days I feel that I physically cannot get out of bed (Picture: PhilYeomans/BNPS)\n\nOn that particular day, instead of approaching me to ask if there was anything she could do to help, that woman sat, stared and made snap judgement without any due consideration for my feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not looking for sympathy though.\n\nI truly believe that if I can raise awareness or help at least one person by being open about my condition, then this whole journey I have been on will have been worth every moment.\n\nI would love to put an end to the stigma, the judgement, the embarrassment and the shame. Whatever it is that an HS sufferer feels about their situation and condition.\n\nI will not let that woman\u2019s comments \u2013 or anyone else\u2019s for that matter \u2013 break my spirit (Picture: PhilYeomans/BNPS)\n\nSometimes, we live with something that others around us are totally unaware of. As an HS sufferer I struggle mentally to stay positive but I\u2019m determined not to let it take control of my life.\n\nI just make sure I battle even harder to keep a positive mind and enjoy my life.\n\nBeing mentally strong isn\u2019t necessarily something that we are gifted with, it\u2019s hard work to tell yourself every day that you are enough. Also to tell yourself you are loved, most importantly by yourself.\n\nIt can be hard to look in the mirror, stand tall and repeat those things every day of your life.\n\nIt works though. I\u2019ve learned over the years who I am, and why I am like I am.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, I\u2019m a product of my condition but that\u2019s not who I am entirely. I\u2019m much more than the scars that are visible, more than the pain and so much more than the judgment and stigma that comes with being \u2018ill\u2019.\n\nPlease, if you are reading this whether you are a sufferer or not, whether you might be that person that has named or labelled, always be kind and compassionate.\n\nBe brave, be bold, give love, accept love from others and most importantly love yourself. Beauty comes from within, not the skin we are in. We are all beautiful in our own way.\n\nElise\u2019s story and battle with HS was filmed for television series The Bad Skin Clinic, which is available to watch on the QuestOD app. You can follow Elise on Instagram here.\n\nLabels Labels is an exclusive series that hears from individuals who have been labelled \u2013 whether that be by society, a job title, or a diagnosis. Throughout the project, writers will share how having these words ascribed to them shaped their identity \u2014 positively or negatively \u2014 and what the label means to them.
