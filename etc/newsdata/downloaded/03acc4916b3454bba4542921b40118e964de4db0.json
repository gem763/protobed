Beijing says it will buy more American goods but has yet to confirm the details, leaving companies wondering whether Chinese leaders have other demands including a possible end to punitive U.S. tariffs before that goes ahead.\n\nNegotiators are \u201cstriving to reach a consensus on the text of the agreement as soon as possible,\u201d said a Ministry of Commerce spokesman, Gao Feng. \u201cI can\u2019t disclose the specific details.\u201d\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Wednesday that officials were still ironing out details of a preliminary agreement.\n\nCompanies welcomed the deal as a small but promising possible step toward breaking a deadlock in the 15-month-old fight over China\u2019s trade surplus and technology ambitions.\n\nTariff hikes by both sides on billions of dollars of imports have battered factories and farmers, weighing on global economic growth. Trump delayed a tariff due to take effect Tuesday on $250 billion of Chinese goods but another increase on $160 billion of imports still is scheduled for Dec. 15.\n\nEconomists warned the truce fails to address more basic complaints about Beijing\u2019s plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technologies.\n\nWashington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Chinese market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over know-how.\n\nChina wants \u201ceconomic and trade relations back on the right track at an early date,\u201d Gao said at a weekly news briefing.\n\nAchieving results will \u201crestore market confidence and also is highly significant for stabilizing the global economic situation,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a foreign ministry spokesman said China would \u201cfurther speed up procurement\u201d of American farm exports but gave no scale or time frame.\n\nChina has bought 20 million tons of U.S. soybeans and 700,000 tons of pork this year, according to the spokesman, Geng Shuang. China imported about 33 million tons of American soybeans annually before the tariff fight and collapsed to 16.6 million tons last year.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China appealed to Washington for a quick end to their trade war but gave no indication Thursday what additional steps Beijing might want", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/3c2a62_china-us-trade-51404-in-monday-oct-14-2019-photo-worker-loads-imported-goods-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
