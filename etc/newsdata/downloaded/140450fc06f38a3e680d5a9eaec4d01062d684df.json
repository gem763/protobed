Ms Zervos sued Mr Trump following his denial of her claims, and in March, an appellate court ruled that he could not prevent the suit from moving forward despite his lawyer\u2019s argument that Mr Trump\u2019s current office put him above the law.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Ms Zervos has presented evidence \u2013 including emails, calendar entries, itineraries and other documents \u2013 that are consistent with her account of her alleged 2007 assault.\n\nThe Trump Organisation is also seeking to redact certain documents which likely contain Mr Trump\u2019s mobile phone number, which suggests Ms Zervos\u2019 evidence also contains phone records.\n\nRecently filed court documents say that Ms Zervos had reported her assaults to \u201cfamily members and close friends immediately after they occurred and then again over the years\u201d.\n\nThe memorandum says Ms Zervos has confronted Mr Trump in a phone call and in an email sent through his secretary Rhona Graff in April 2016.\n\nMs Zervos also contacted Fox News in August 2015, according to court documents, and reported that Mr Trump had invited her \u201cto a hotel room under the guise of working for him but instead acted inappropriately\u201d towards her.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Plaintiff sought legal counsel in 2011 and spoke about this to others including a news organisation \u2013 years before the events of 2016 at issue in this case \u2013 strongly supports the inference that her core narrative is true,\u201d the memorandum states.\n\nMs Zervos also submitted the results of a polygraph test.\n\nThe latest developments in her lawsuit arrive as Mr Trump and his Republican allies craft a response to an impeachment probe investigating Mr Trump\u2019s alleged abuses of power in his dealings with Ukraine and an exchange of information that he could use to potentially damage Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nRead more\n\nThe full list of women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual assault\n\nRepublicans break House rules by stalling Trump impeachment hearings\n\nTrump compares impeachment probe to \u2018lynching\u2019 in explosive rant\n\nLindsey Graham lashes out over impeachment probe", "description": "Summer Zervos, who was on the fifth season of Donald Trump\u2018s reality TV competition The Apprentice, has reportedly introduced evidence that the president attacked her in a hotel in 2007, corroborating the basis of a lawsuit that could be headed to trial in the midst of an impeachment probe and 2020 elections.Ms", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PiFvEASyMS7.yBe8uOtvEg--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/67575b70b991fac64ad0a75f2fdaf333", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
