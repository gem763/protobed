Federal health officials, too, are looking into the substance as a possible cause \u2014 though were quick to note it is only one of the many they are investigating.\n\nIn a news release, New York State Department of Health officials said tests showed \u201cvery high levels\u201d of vitamin E acetate in \u201cnearly all of the cannabis-containing samples\u201d that were analyzed by the Wadsworth Center, a state laboratory associated with the health department.\n\nNew York has seen 34 cases of severe pulmonary illness linked to vaping in patients ages 15 to 46. All the patients used at least one cannabis-containing device before becoming ill, but reported using other vaping products as well.\n\nE-CIGARETTES DAMAGE BLOOD VESSELS EVEN IF DEVICES DON\u2019T CONTAIN NICOTINE, STUDY FINDS\n\n\u201cAt least one vitamin E acetate containing vape product has been linked to each patient who submitted a product for testing,\u201d officials said in the news release.\n\nThirteen samples were collected from eight of the patients.\n\n\u201cThese samples have been tested for a range of substances, including THC and other cannabis-derived cannabinoids, nicotine, synthetic cannabinoids, opioids, and pesticides,\" they said. \"Products tested include a variety of labels and packaging. Many are suspected to be counterfeits of recreational cannabis-containing vape products available in other states.\"\n\n\u201cIt is premature to say any one of these is the cause of pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use.\" \u2014 CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard\n\nThe compound was not found in nicotine-containing devices, officials said, adding the affected products are not a part of New York\u2019s medical marijuana program.\n\nThough vitamin E acetate is now a key focus of the New York Department of Health\u2019s investigations, federal health officials told Fox News it is only one of the \u201cmultiple substances being investigated\u201d at this time.\n\n\u201cIt is premature to say any one of these is the cause of pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use,\u201d Courtney Lenard, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a statement.\n\nAdditionally, Michael Felberbaum, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cautioned that \u201cmore information is needed to better understand whether there\u2019s a relationship between any specific products or substances and the reported illnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking into potential leads regarding any particular constituent or compound that may be at issue,\u201d he said in a statement to Fox News, adding the federal agency has more than 100 samples they are testing for a \u201cbroad range\u201d of chemicals.\n\n\u201cNo one substance, including Vitamin E acetate, has been identified in all of the samples tested,\u201d he said. \u201cImportantly, identifying any compounds that are present in the samples will be one piece of the puzzle but will not necessarily answer questions about causality. The results from the FDA\u2019s laboratory analysis will be shared with the respective states to aid in their investigations and will help further inform the federal response.\u201d\n\nVitamin E acetate is typically used as a nutritional supplement; the compound, often in oil form, is derived from vitamin E. Though it\u2019s not known to cause harm when it\u2019s ingested or applied to the skin, the same may not be true in connection to the lung illnesses.\n\nMichelle Francl, a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College, explained to The Washington Post that vitamin E acetate, when heated to high temperatures, becomes a vapor. As it cools, it returns to its original state.\n\nWhen ingested through a vaping device, the compound returns to an oil form when it reaches the lungs, potentially causing illness because the lungs are not equipped to handle substances other than gases.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t looked at the toxicity of vitamin E in the lungs. The lungs are designed to exchange gas molecules; they\u2019re not designed to be exposed to other chemicals,\u201d said Laura Crotty Alexander, lung inflammation and e-cigarette researcher at the University of California at San Diego\u2019s School of Medicine, to the Post.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA MAN IN MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA: DOCTORS 'KNOW IT'S VAPING'\n\nThe CDC recently said there are 215 illnesses across 25 states. The first vaping-related death was reported last month in Illinois. A second was recently reported in Oregon.\n\nPatients experienced similar symptoms in the days to weeks before becoming ill, such as shortness of breath, pain associated with breathing, cough, fever, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\"We urge the public to be vigilant about any vaping products that they or any family members may be using and to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop any unusual symptoms,\" said New York State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker in a statement. \"In general, vaping of unknown substances is dangerous, and we continue to explore all options to combat this public health issue.\"", "description": "New York health officials this week announced they are investigating the compound vitamin E acetate as a possible cause of the vaping-associated lung illnesses in the state.
