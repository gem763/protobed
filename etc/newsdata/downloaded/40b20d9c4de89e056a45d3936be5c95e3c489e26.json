Both were directed by Argentine filmmaker Andy Muschietti.\n\nJeff Goldstein, who oversees domestic distribution for Warner Bros., called the debut \u201csensational\u201d and isn\u2019t concerned that \u201cChapter Two\u201d didn\u2019t hit the heights of the first.\n\n\u201cHow many movies open to $91 million? That was lightning in a bottle,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get lightning in a bottle twice. You get close though.\u201d\n\nBased on Stephen King\u2019s novel, \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d brings the Losers Club back to Derry 27 years later to take on the demonic clown Pennywise, and stars James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader as a few of the adult \u201closers.\u201d The sequel cost around $79.5 million to make. Reviews were a little more mixed than for the first - 86% versus 64% on Rotten Tomatoes - but audiences were consistent. Both films got a B+ CinemaScore.\n\n\u201cAndy Muschietti does an incredible job of scaring the stuffing out of audiences,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cI think our team, starting with New Line in making this and our marketing team in bringing it to audiences around the globe, have hit the mark right on. They nailed it.\u201d\n\nComscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian noted that, unlike most horror films which tend drop off significantly after opening weekend, \u201cIt: Chapter Two,\u201d like its predecessor and some of the recent high quality horror films could have \u201cincredibly long playability.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d is also a big win for Warner Bros., which had a few disappointments this summer with \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d and \u201cShaft,\u201d but also have a few films that could really take off, including \u201cJoker,\u201d out Oct. 4, and another King adaptation, \u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d out Nov. 8.\n\nThe rest of the top 10 was populated by holdovers: \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d took a distant second with $6 million and \u201cGood Boys\u201d placed third with $5.4 million. In limited release, the documentary \u201cLinda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice\u201d performed well in its first weekend, grossing $115,500 from seven locations.\n\nAfter a down summer for the industry as a whole and a year that is still running 6% down, \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d is a promising start to the fall movie season, which runs from the day after Labor Day weekend through November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to have a movie to get the momentum going,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
