Ethnic minority community leaders and the mosque\u2019s management had called for the community to accept the apologies offered by the government and police officials.\n\nChief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung went to the mosque on Monday to deliver their apologies in person. The police force said in a press conference the same day that the water canon was deployed to protect the mosque amid concerns that it would be targeted by protesters.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mohan Chugani, the former president of the Indian Association of Hong Kong, lodged a complaint asking the police to admit that the small group of people outside the mosque at the time of the spraying were not protesters. Chugani was among those sprayed at the time.\n\nBut on Wednesday night, Chugani told Lam at a cocktail reception held by the Indian Chamber of Commerce that her apology was accepted.\n\n\u201cShe asked me to stay cool and not to be so angry. And I told her that her apology was accepted and I am cool,\u201d Chugani said, describing the exchange as courteous.\n\nOutside Kowloon Mosque on Wednesday, blue stains were still apparent on the fences around the stairs. But several worshippers who came to pray told the Post they were no longer distressed about Sunday\u2019s incident.\n\nShe asked me to stay cool and not to be so angry. And I told her that her apology was accepted and I am cool\n\nMohan Chugani, former president of the Indian Association of Hong Kong\n\nFahim Butt, 34, a native of Pakistan who has lived in Hong Kong for 13 years, said he had been praying at the mosque an hour before the water cannon spraying. He said he felt \u201cpain and anger\u201d after seeing blue dye on the mosque\u2019s entrance.\n\nSome Muslims were still privately angry, he said, but most Muslims would support the message sent out on Monday from Chief Imam Muhammad Arshad to accept the government\u2019s apology.\n\n\u201cYou cannot touch anybody\u2019s religion, especially the places of prayer, [no matter if it is] a temple, mosque or church,\u201d said Butt. \u201cWe should follow the chief imam and the Muslim community, but on our own side [privately] we are still angry.\u201d\n\nMohamed, 24, was born and raised in Hong Kong to an Indian family. He helped clean up the mosque on Sunday, but no longer felt the incident was a \u201cbig deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cMost of our community feels that it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cleaned it up and then we go on with our lives. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\nAsad Cheema, 25, works at a mobile phone shop in Chungking Mansions. He is from Pakistan and has lived in Hong Kong for nearly 11 years. He said he was no longer angry after government and police apologies, and he thanked everyone, including protesters, who helped clean up the mosque.\n\n\u201cWe want peace,\u201d he said.\n\nDozens of demonstrators also gathered outside Chungking Mansions on at 7pm on Wednesday for a flash mob event to show support for the ethnic minority community and thank them for their support in the anti-government protest movement.\n\nThe crowd, many in masks and dressed in black, sang protest anthems, including Glory to Hong Kong, and Cantonese songs by the popular local band Beyond.\n\nOne of the onlookers outside Chungking Mansions was KK Khan, 34, a Muslim who helped distribute bottles of water to protesters on Sunday.\n\nKhan, who owns a mobile phone shop in Chungking Mansions, said most people from the city\u2019s ethnic minority communities were peaceful people who did not want any kind of violence. He said he hoped the protesters and the government would find a solution to the crisis.\n\nVolunteers clean up Kowloon Mosque in Tsim Sha Tsui on Sunday after a police water cannon sprayed the building with blue-dyed water.
