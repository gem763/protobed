Not only is it an effective way to network with other professionals in your field, but it can get you noticed by others and potentially land you several job opportunities. In fact, I landed a great job at a major company because I regularly updated my profile and published career-related content almost daily. (That job ultimately inspired me to start my own company.) Believe it or not, that was six years ago \u2014 and today, LinkedIn has only become increasingly important.\n\nThe LinkedIn profile summary\n\nSimply signing up for an account, quickly filling in the blanks and then letting your profile remain dormant won't do you any good. Of the many elements that make up a strong profile, two of the most important ones are your professional headline and \"About\" section, explain career experts at Harvard University's Office for Alumni Affairs and Career Advancement. Together, they make up what's known as your \"LinkedIn profile summary,\" and it's one of the first things people see when they visit your page. Your professional headline is especially important because it's the text that gets displayed in search results for both Google and LinkedIn. Below is an example of a strong LinkedIn profile summary, according to the career experts at Harvard: *** NAME:\n\nJessica Yan PROFESSIONAL HEADLINE:\n\nResearch Scientist | Ph.D. Candidate | Data Analytics, Biotech, Pharma \"ABOUT\" SECTION:\n\nI'm a research scientist working to better understand how neural activity motivates and shapes human behavior. My expertise includes project design and management, data analysis and interpretation, and the development and implementation of research tools. I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My colleagues would describe me as a driven, resourceful individual who maintains a positive, proactive attitude when faced with adversity. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to develop and promote technologies that benefit human health. Specific fields of interest include data analytics, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals. *** Here's what makes it a strong profile summary: Can be skimmed in 30 seconds or less\n\nProfessional headline is below 120 characters, lists career focus and components of work\n\nIncludes industry-related keywords, core skills, strengths, talents and interests\n\nWell written in a professional style, no spelling and grammatical mistakes\n\nAnswers questions that provides deeper insight about the individual: What makes her unique?
