Investors who have to draw down on capital during a bear market do so at depressed prices. As their capital shrinks, there are less funds available to benefit from an eventual sharemarket recovery.", "description": "A 65-year-old retiree who experiences a 17 per cent loss within the first year of retirement, on a $500,000 portfolio, will run out of money at 85.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.577%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_132/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/23022ca6f8f433d0cb6519330a100e1e850cf3d8", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
