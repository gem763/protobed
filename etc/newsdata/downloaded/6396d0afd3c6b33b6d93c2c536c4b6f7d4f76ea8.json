But will they act?\n\nJean-Claude Juncker\u2019s tenure as European Commission president will end with an unchecked resurgence of measles \u2014 despite his unusual intervention on a health-related matter.\n\nOn Thursday, Juncker blamed \u201cstupid mistrust\u201d of vaccines, in part, for deaths from preventable diseases in Europe. People who decline immunizations are \u201cplaying with fire,\u201d he warned.\n\nAs that fire spreads across Europe, Juncker\u2019s ambition to boost vaccine coverage is running up against the same restrictions on the EU\u2019s role in health that have stymied so many other efforts by the bloc.\n\nTwo years after he called it \u201cunacceptable\" that children in Europe are still dying of diseases that should have been eradicated, the spread of measles shows few signs of letting up. Last month, three EU countries \u2014 Greece, the U.K. and the Czech Republic \u2014 lost their measles-free status, while only one, Austria, attained it.\n\nMeanwhile, epidemics are still raging in France, Poland, Italy and Romania, and the numbers are grim. As of June, the EU28 already racked up 10,056 reported measles cases in 2019 \u2014 meaning it\u2019s on track to double the 12,586 from 2018, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).\n\nJuncker deserves credit for his \"passion\" about the issue, according to World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nDespite those numbers, public health experts give Juncker credit for forcing capitals to discuss a topic they\u2019d long resisted, drawing on a keen sense of timing. This may be only baby steps at best, but Juncker may have laid the groundwork for Europe\u2019s global leadership in the fight against vaccine hesitancy, say some health experts.\n\n\n\nJuncker deserves credit for his \"passion\" about the issue, according to World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He and Junker held a late fall powwow in 2018 when they decided to hold a high-level vaccines summit in Brussels this year.\n\n\u201cHe was so worried because the headline of our meeting at that time was: Children are dying in Europe because of preventable diseases,\" Tedros said.\n\nOn Thursday, Juncker spoke at that global gathering, which included Tedros, the U.S. surgeon general and a global cast of experts and policymakers. \u201cGiven the huge challenge ahead of us, no single country and no single organization can achieve success,\u201d Juncker told the audience.\n\nSurprise priority\n\nHealth-sector lobbyists in Brussels were shocked when they heard Juncker mention vaccines in his 2017 State of the EU address. This was, after all, a man who just six months earlier had floated the possibility of doing even less on health as part of post-Brexit EU reform.\n\nBut in that speech, he cast the issue as a matter of equality, arguing there \u201ccan be no second class citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren in Romania or Italy must have the same access to measles vaccines as children in other European countries,\" he added. \"No ifs, no buts.\u201d\n\nThe timing was key. Initially, first reports of outbreaks came from Romania \u2014 a country with a notoriously poor health system dealing with a mixture of shortages and vaccine hesitancy. But suddenly, they were starting to make headlines around the bloc, as they spread to Italy and elsewhere. In April 2017, an unvaccinated Portuguese teenager died of measles. And over that summer, health ministers\u2019 plans to impose requirements that kids receive 10 or more vaccines fired up political debates in France and Italy.\n\nIn his 2017 address, Juncker pledged that the Commission was \"working with all member states to support national vaccination efforts.\u201d\n\nThat hadn\u2019t really been the case up to that point. The Commission participated in discussions on matters such as cross-border health threats, but countries shut down any discussion on proposals like aligning vaccine schedules or building comparable registries.\n\nThe showy summits with broad focus leave the effort vulnerable to charges that it\u2019s all talk and no action.\n\nExperts increasingly call for such changes. An ECDC survey cited in a 2018 report found that out of 16 countries, only 10 had immunization information systems that could be used to record why people were declining vaccines. Without this information, fighting hesitancy is shooting in the dark.\n\nBut Juncker soon found he couldn\u2019t push EU countries much further. National governments ultimately watered down already modest Commission proposals for moving toward a common vaccine schedule or creating an EU vaccine ID card to list people\u2019s record of jabs.\n\nThose results were \u201creally disappointing,\u201d said Fiona Godfrey, secretary-general of the European Public Health Alliance. \u201cWith the lack of support from member states, there\u2019s not a lot more [the Commission] can do.\u201d\n\nMore recently, however, the year-old European Joint Action on Vaccination, run by the Commission and the French government, is seeing some room for compromise. Countries are working on developing a standard protocol for responding to an outbreak alert from another country, said coordinator Genevi\u00e8ve Ch\u00eane of France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research.\n\nStates are also inching toward working together on developing vaccine schedule. In echoes of the debate over EU-level health technology assessment, it seems capitals would be open to working together on considering the science of vaccine timing, as long as they can still make their own decisions about when shots should actually be administered.\n\nSoft Power Player\n\nThis week's summit was exuberant by the standards of a Commission \"stakeholders\" gathering. U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams made a selfie-video of the auditorium affirming the hashtag \u201cvaccines work.\u201d Yvonne Chaka Chaka, a South African music icon, belted out a melodic moral gut-check. And 18-year-old American activist Ethan Lindenberger played out the ultimate teenage rebellion, decrying his mother\u2019s anti-vax views on the world stage.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s for the member states to continue this exercise. This is the only way to move the needle\" \u2014 Magdalena de Azero, executive director of Vaccines Europe\n\nThe WHO and the Commission plan to make the summit a regular affair.\n\nThe showy summits with broad focus leave the effort vulnerable to charges that it\u2019s all talk and no action. But at this stage, the talk is important, said Ber Oomen, executive director of the European Specialist Nurses Association (ESNO).\n\n\u201cIt will be very important to see this kind of overall solidarity ... so there\u2019s not one organization that says, \u2018I represent 5 zillion health care organizations, and I will be the one who solved this problem,\u2019\u201d Oomen said.\n\nGiven that the Commission\u2019s latest vaccines effort leans heavily on health professionals to restore trust, it\u2019s helping groups like ESNO get an audience with national authorities. The big question remains whether they\u2019ll pay attention.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s for the member states to continue this exercise,\u201d said Magdalena de Azero, executive director of the pharma-backed coalition Vaccines Europe. \"This is the only way to move the needle.\"\n\nJillian Deutsch and Carmen Paun contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Health Care.
