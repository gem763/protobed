The questions covered data privacy, cybersecurity and the business of social media topics.\n\nPretty much everyone these days has a smartphone, a laptop and some kind of online social media presence. But few users fully understand the implications of using that tech or the related potential privacy and security concerns. Ads follow users around online, phones spy on us while we\u2019re sleeping and even our TVs are tracking us.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat makes it difficult for average tech users to make the right decisions about what data to share, what information to believe and how to protect themselves online.\n\nFred Turner, a communications professor at Stanford University, said the country\u2019s technological literacy has struggled to keep pace with the speed with which digital tools have grown increasingly complex and opaque.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is not at all what you get,\u201d he said, calling for better digital education.\n\nUsers are grappling with these issues as social media giants have been rocked by privacy scandals. In September, Facebook said that tens of thousands of apps were suspended from its platform for possibly mishandling user data. That followed last year\u2019s revelation that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed personal data from 87 million Facebook users.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Twitter said it may have mishandled an unknown number of users\u2019 email addresses and phone numbers, allowing them to be used \u201cinadvertently\u201d for advertising purposes.\n\nOnly 15 percent of the 4,272 surveyed participants could identify a photo of Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive.\n\nFacebook did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nPew found that people with more education had greater digital knowledge. Younger people fared better on the quiz than older people, but the gaps were less stark than those found with educational attainment.\n\nMonica Anderson, a co-author of the report, said previous Pew studies have found that the majority of Americans use social media websites, primarily Facebook. Yet the June survey showed that only 29 percent of those surveyed knew that Facebook owns Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nFacebook purchased the Instagram photo- and video-sharing service in 2012 for $1 billion and acquired messaging company WhatsApp for $16 billion two years later. In August, Facebook confirmed a report by the online outlet the Information that said the company was renaming the two services \u201cInstagram from Facebook\u201d and \u201cWhatsApp from Facebook.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Only 2 percent of Americans can ace a digital-knowledge quiz.", "authors": ["Marie C.
