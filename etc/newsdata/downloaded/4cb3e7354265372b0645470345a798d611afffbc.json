Shell Energy is the first company to face enforcement action for breaching the cap. A number of other companies are understood to have breached the cap but consumer detriment was significantly smaller than that caused by Shell Energy so Ofgem did not take enforcement action.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In addition to a refund each of these customers will receive an additional \u00a310 per fuel.\n\nThe remaining 5,600 customer accounts experienced a delay in their energy price being reduced under the price cap after they requested to change to a cheaper means of paying for their energy.\n\nThis meant they were paying above the cap level for longer than necessary. They will each receive a refund plus an extra \u00a35 per fuel.\n\nIn total the 12,000 customer accounts affected around 8,800 customers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We always intended to re-credit these customers, which we are now doing together with a compensation payment, and have agreed to pay into the Ofgem redress fund.\u201d\n\nThe default cap is currently \u00a31,254 per annum for the period between 1 April and 30 September 2019 for households on dual fuel, single-rate (no peak/off-peak) tariffs based on typical consumption.\n\nShell announced in March this year that it would switch all of its 700,000 energy customers to renewable supply.\n\nPurchasing First Utility in 2018 marked Shell\u2019s first step into retail gas and electricity supply as it looks to diversify away from its core fossil fuels business and take on the Big Six energy suppliers.\n\nThe vast majority of the group\u2019s \u00a3388bn annual revenues still come from oil and gas, however.", "description": "Shell Energy is\u00a0to pay \u00a3390,000 in fines and compensation after overcharging around 12,000 customer accounts.
