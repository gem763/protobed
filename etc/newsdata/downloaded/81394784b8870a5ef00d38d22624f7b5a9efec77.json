The goal of the plan, he added, was to pool expertise and resources \u201cto make sure there\u2019s a stable and secure global market that\u2019s not easily disrupted by shocks and outside influences.\u201d\n\nRare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements used in everything from high-tech consumer electronics to military equipment.\n\nAustralia contains only 2.8% of the world\u2019s rare earth reserves, but accounts for more than half of the new projects in the global pipeline.\n\nRare earth minerals need to be processed after they are extracted from the ground. There is only one operational rare earths mine in the United States, although the country has no processing facilities.\n\nChina is the world\u2019s largest processor and producer of the minerals, accounting for more than 80% of global processing capacity.\n\nAfter trade talks broke down in May, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a rare earths plant, sparking speculation that China would use its dominant position as an exporter of rare earths to the United States as leverage in the trade dispute.\n\nChinese negotiators are in Washington for talks as the world\u2019s two largest economies try to bridge deep policy differences and find a way out of a protracted trade war.\n\nA Pentagon official said in August the Defense Department was in talks with Australia to host a facility that would process rare earth metals. The White House official did not respond on Thursday when asked if the plan set to be unveiled would involve such facilities.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Lynas Corp Ltd, the world\u2019s largest rare earths miner and processor outside of China, is developing a processing plant in Texas. Chief Executive Amanda Lacaze said last month the company was open to receiving U.S. government funding to build it.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison are set to release a plan on Friday aimed at securing the supply of rare earth minerals, a senior administration official said, as concerns grow that China could cut off shipments of the prized commodities.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
