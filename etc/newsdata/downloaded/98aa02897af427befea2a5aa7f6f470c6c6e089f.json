Prosecutors alleged that Princess Hessa bint Salman became enraged when she saw the plumber capturing her image in Paris, fearing the pictures could be used to harm her as the Saudi monarch's daughter and the older half-sister of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nShe left France shortly after the September 2016 incident and was not present for Thursday's verdict. Her whereabouts are not confirmed, but it is widely expected that she has returned to Saudi Arabia. She was sentenced to 10 months suspended prison sentence and a 10,000 euro ($10,970) fine.\n\nHer bodyguard, Rani Saida, was found guilty on charges of violence, sequestration and theft.\n\nThe workman said he was tied up and ordered to kiss the feet of the princess, who is thought to be in her 40s and is lionized in the Saudi state-run media for charity work and women's rights campaigning.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman talks with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud during the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia December 9, 2018.

But his reputation was badly damaged by the murder of dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAgnes Callamard, a UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, reported \"credible evidence\" in June that linked him to the killing of Khashoggi, who was strangled and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.", "description": "King Salman's daughter left France soon after the incident in her Paris apartment.
