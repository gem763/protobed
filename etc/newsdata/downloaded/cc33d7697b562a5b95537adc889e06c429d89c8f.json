Clearly they are saying \u2018don\u2019t expect us to move more aggressively, and after the December meeting we will probably play it with more caution\u2019,\u201d said Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Banco Safra in Sao Paulo.\n\n\u201cYou can read it as a little bit more conservative than the market pricing. They have opened the door to go below 4.50%, but perhaps at a slower pace,\u201d he said, sticking by his call for another half percentage point cut in December followed by two quarter-point cuts early next year.\n\nThe decision of the bank\u2019s nine-person strong rate-setting committee, known as \u2018Copom\u2019, to reduce the Selic rate by 50 basis points was unanimous, as was the median forecast of all 31 economists in a Reuters poll.\n\nIn its accompanying statement, Copom said the benign outlook for inflation \u201cshould allow for an additional adjustment of equal magnitude,\u201d but warned that low rates could increase uncertainty about the transmission channels and \u201cmay raise the inflation trajectory over the relevant monetary policy horizon.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s move was Copom\u2019s third consecutive 50-basis point cut under the leadership of Roberto Campos Neto, the U.S.-trained economist and former banker who took the helm of the central bank in February.\n\nIn recent months inflation has continued to fall, the pass-through impact on the exchange rate has been muted and Congress passed a landmark pension reform, saving some 800 billion reais ($200 billion) in public spending over the next decade.\n\nAll of that, against a backdrop of a widespread global monetary easing cycle, has until now given Copom the necessary cover to cut interest rates aggressively.\n\nWhile policymakers noted the upside risks to inflation and economic uncertainty from ultra-low rates, Copom\u2019s inflation outlook remained dovish.\n\nUsing a \u201chybrid\u201d forecast of a constant exchange rate of 4.05 reais per dollar and a broad consensus view on interest rates, Copom projected 3.7% inflation next year and 3.6% in 2020. That\u2019s still below the central bank\u2019s official 2020 and 2021 targets of 4.00% and 3.75%, respectively.", "description": "Brazil's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a new all-time low of 5.00% on Wednesday as expected, but signaled that further easing may be less aggressive than it has been in recent months, despite inflation running well below target.", "authors": ["Jamie Mcgeever", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
