Excuse me, BIRD WORLD?! Lana Del Rey dropped a bombshell while discussing her latest album, Norman Fucking Rockwell! with producer Jack Antonoff. Apparently, one of the titles considered for the mood record about unstable women and the fuckboys who try to love them was Bird World. Which means, if the multiverse theory of reality is true, there is a parallel universe somewhere out there where Lana Del Rey just released an album implicitly about a world of birds. Do the Beatles exist in this universe? Who\u2019s to say! Was Tuca & Bertie given a second season in this reality? Almost certainly. It\u2019s the birds\u2019 world, after all.\n\noh my god lana del rey almost named her album bird world\n\n\n\nholy shit pic.twitter.com/g8TWf2lCCK \u2014 leon (@leyawn) September 5, 2019\n\nThere is a YouTube channel that remixes films and television shows to LDR\u2019s music. The choices are not intuitive, but they are art of the highest form. I\u2019m going to need this auteur to mix a track off Shoulda Been Called \u201cBird World\u201d to footage of birds from Planet Earth immediately. Maybe \u201cCinnamon Girl.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being hyperbolic in saying it could easily end world hunger.", "description": "Lana Del Rey was speaking to Jack Antonoff, promoting their album together: Norman Fucking Rockwell!
