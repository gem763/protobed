Two years ago, he even predicted \"a lot of dead unicorns.\"\n\nThe disappointing IPOs of Uber and Lyft, and the fiasco that was WeWork's aborted public offering, have seemingly borne out his warnings.\n\nThe problem, he tells Business Insider, is that these large startups grew too big without going through the \"spiritual cleanse\" that the IPO process provides.\n\n\"For a lot of my friends, I tell them the same thing, which is they need to go public earlier, not take so much money,\" he told Business Insider, as part of his media tour for his new book about corporate social responsibility called \"Trailblazer\".\n\n\"The IPO is a spiritual cleanse. It's true. It causes everything that's bad in your company to come out because the governance processes take hold: Sarbanes-Oxley, SEC, GAAP accounting, auditing, all of these, because you're taking other people's money,\" he said, referring to several of the regulations and requirements around the IPO process.\n\nYet when asked if WeWork, and its corporate parent The We Company, was the ultimate example of all-things-wrong with unicorns, Benioff stood up for WeWork founder Adam Neumann.\n\nNeumann was forced to resign as CEO of his company last month when his IPO went off the rails after the company released its S-1, the prospectus to go public. In the S-1, the company detailed a long list of items that scared off investors \u2014 from its business model fundamentals, to Neumann's unchecked power and self-dealing. We's bonds are now rated deep into junk territory and the company is seeking other financing options to keep itself afloat.\n\nBut Benioff gave some surprising full-throated support for Neumann, while at the same time seeming to almost admit that We is one of those unicorns he had foretold.\n\n\"Adam is a friend of mine. I actually think he's probably one of the greatest entrepreneurs I've ever met. He's an incredible evangelist. He's an incredible visionary. He's hired a lot of amazing people. He's built an amazing brand, right? Unfortunately, there were some things, obviously, in the company that you probably would have preferred to change if he could do it all over again,\" Benioff said.\n\n\"They have like $3 billion in revenue, but Salesforce went public when we had $100 million in revenue,\" Benioff said. It used to be common for a startup to go public once it hit the $100 million mark.\n\nBenioff and Neumann are also sort-of neighbors: WeWork rented three stories in San Francisco's Salesforce Tower, where Benioff keeps his office, to make its West Coast headquarters. WeWork's offices there have a grand-scale design, and are connected by a large atrium and a huge staircase, Architectural Digest reported in 2018.\n\nBut WeWork is already said to be gearing up of hefty layoffs of its 10,000-plus workforce, plus selling off a number of the companies it acquired, putting its need for such large and lavish employee offices in question.", "description": "Marc Benioff has been warning for years that unicorns are prone to governance issues.
