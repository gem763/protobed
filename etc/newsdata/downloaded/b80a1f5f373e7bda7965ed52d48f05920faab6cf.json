Can you see \u2013 the black feathers on the head of that one have a slightly green sheen, while those on this bird are purplish.\"\n\nTo ordinary mortals, the birds look identical. But then, Sof\u00eda is a naturalist guide of the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, with 31 years of experience under her belt, and an encyclopaedic knowledge of the flora, fauna, geology and human history of the islands. Born in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito, she studied at Madrid University before returning to her homeland in 1987, to train as a guide at the Charles Darwin Research Station and Gal\u00e1pagos National Park. Graduating as a level 3 guide (the highest qualification), and fluent in three languages, she is one of more than 700 freelance certified guides, and is currently contracted aboard the luxury yacht, MV Theory.\n\n\u201cI could not have done it now\u201d she says. \u201cIn 1989, the law was changed so that only residents of the Galapagos could become guides. From that date, you could not move from mainland Ecuador to the islands \u2013 unless you married a local. And you\u2019d have to remain married for five years to obtain permanent residency \u2013 a specification which was closely monitored, and was later changed to 10 years.\n\n\u201dWhile such measures have been good for the islanders, the exclusion of biologists and scientists from the mainland and abroad has seen a drop in standards of guiding. The islanders just don\u2019t have the same education opportunities\u201d says Sof\u00eda who, as president of AGIPA [Association of Naturalist Guides of the Gal\u00e1pagos] is lobbying for a university on the islands, and for better internet access. \u201cGuiding has become very competitive. The best boats engage the best guides and offer the best terms. The Park imposes a maximum of 16 guests per guide, but on a boat such as the MV Theory, groups are never larger than ten.\u201d\n\nSofia Darquea is one of 700 freelance guides contracted to work in the Galapagos More\n\nAchieving her childhood dream of working with animals in the Galapagos has not been without sacrifices. \u201cMy family lives on the mainland and flights are expensive,\u201d she explains. \"A limited number of seats are discounted for us, but they are not always available.\u201d Food and housing is also expensive \u2013 some three times more than on the mainland \u2013 and stringent regulations exist to protect this fragile environment, of which 97 per cent is protected, and only 3 per cent inhabited.\n\nAs well as a moratorium on new hotels and boats, for example, the number of cars has been limited. \u201cYou need a permit to buy a car, and no more are being issued,\u201d says Sofia. \u201cIf I want a car, I have to buy an existing permit from someone \u2013 which costs around $40,000. Then you have to buy the car \u2013 and to get a new car, you\u2019d have to send an old one back to the mainland.\u201d\n\nSof\u00eda lives in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz \u2013 one of four islands with a community \u2013 and the commercial capital of the archipelago, crammed with hostels, hotels and tour operators. \u201cThere were only 3,000 residents here when I first came,\u201d she says. \u201cToday there are over 12,000. There is no sewage system on the islands, and not everyone can afford a septic tank. And there is no potable water. Infrastructure is a problem.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Sof\u00eda Darquea is pointing out two male frigates sitting side by side in a palo santo tree, red chests puffed out like balloons in a bid to attract females. \u201cThe one on the left is a great frigate\u201d she explains. \u201cThe one on the right is a magnificent frigate.
