It was part of the rift between China\u2019s government and the league - started by a since-deleted tweet from Houston general manager Daryl Morey that supported anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nThe U.S. and Chinese national anthems were not played before the game. All media events Thursday at Mercedes-Benz Arena - including pregame availabilities, postgame news conferences and a long-scheduled media session with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver - were canceled.\n\nBut fans came in droves, nearly every seat in the 18,000-seat arena appeared filled and they cheered for James loudest of all - as usual. James has made almost-annual visits to China during his NBA career to promote the game and his personal brand, and his popularity there is enormous.\n\nGiven fan reaction to James there this week, including being mobbed by well-wishers who chanted and snapped countless pictures with their phones as he walked through a Shanghai mall on Wednesday, not even the politically charged unrest between China and the NBA could dampen how revered he is in the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nIt was a topic again in Tokyo on Thursday, where Houston and Toronto finished their two-game series. The Rockets, of course, have been at the forefront of the rift between China and the league because of Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cYou know what? It\u2019s a tough situation,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said after Houston\u2019s 118-111 win over the reigning NBA champion Raptors. \u201cVery difficult. Adam Silver speaks for the NBA. I work for the NBA. I go with Adam. Commissioner Silver will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nIrving tried to play through his left-side facial fracture, an injury that occurred in a pickup game last month. He was wearing a clear mask in an effort to protect his face, but bumped into Rondo while playing defense just 1:06 into the contest.\n\nIrving\u2019s face made contact with Rondo\u2019s upper arm. The Nets guard immediately winced in pain, took the mask off and motioned to the bench that he needed a substitute.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t concern enough, the Nets lost their other starting guard just 22 seconds later. Caris LeVert left with 10:32 remaining in the first quarter after being poked in the eye and didn\u2019t return.\n\nJames made 7 of 15 shots, including 2 of 3 from 3-point range and added six rebounds in 24 1/2 minutes. The Lakers and Nets play again Saturday in Shenzhen, China.\n\nThere are five games later Thursday: Oklahoma City plays host to the New Zealand Breakers, Portland hosts Maccabi Haifa, Phoenix is at Sacramento, Minnesota goes to Golden State and Denver visits the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nROCKETS 118, RAPTORS 111\n\nIn Tokyo, Russell Westbrook and James Harden each scored 22 points to lead Houston.\n\nNeither of the Rockets\u2019 starting guards shot particularly well - combined, they were 13 of 33 from the field and 4 for 19 from 3-point range - and Harden missed his last six 3-point attempts. But the Rockets started fast, getting out to a 22-8 lead, and then overcame a 13-point second-half deficit after both sides pulled most of their starters.\n\nAnd the fans - more than 20,000 in Tokyo - loved what they saw from the former MVPs, regaling them both with \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants.\n\n\u201cIt feels great anytime you hear those chants. Both of us have accomplished that unbelievable goal, being MVP,\u201d Harden said. \u201cI think the reason that we\u2019re here together is to accomplish something bigger than that. Obviously, it\u2019s going to take time but we\u2019re in the right direction, right steps. We have a long season ahead of us and I think we\u2019re all excited for it.\u201d\n\nEric Gordon scored 14 points for Houston.\n\nNorman Powell scored 22 for Toronto, which got 16 points from Pascal Siakam and a 10-point, 10-assist double-double from Fred VanVleet.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyrie Irving flew halfway around the world to play for 66 seconds.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/japan_rockets_raptors_basketball_70531_c0-153-3667-2291_s1770x1032.jpg?b21e10c9081e097c02b533191c253256f43e9e37", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
