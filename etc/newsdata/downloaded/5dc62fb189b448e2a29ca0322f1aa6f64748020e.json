The Texans refused! They were not about to give up their only means of self-defense.\n\nHe added:\n\nIn response, Santa Anna\u2019s army returned with a large group of additional people. They had men all over the place\u2026[but] this time they were met by dozens of Texans\u2026who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom. As Santa Anna\u2019s men watched from a distance those brave Texans raised a flag for all to see. On the banner they painted a cannon along with four words that echoed through the ages. It said, \u201cCome and Take It.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cLike those early Texans, Americans will never surrender, ever, ever. We will never surrender. We will never give up our freedom. Americans were born free. We will live free and we will die free.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
