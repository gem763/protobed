Similar to last year, White House budget officials have asked lawmakers to include a provision in the bill that would keep the Commodity Credit Corporation from breaching its $30 billion borrowing limit in the coming months under the strain of the tariff relief payments.\n\nThe trade aid money is paid out of the CCC, a Depression-era agency within USDA. USDA has so far paid $3.3 billion out of the $14.5 billion set aside for farm payments for 2019. The agency sent $8.6 billion in direct payments for last year\u2019s production.\n\nThe financial demands of those aid programs, in addition to CCC\u2019s regular obligations, have left the agency with dwindling room to keep borrowing. That could put additional trade aid payments at risk of being cut off by the end of the year unless Congress acts.\n\nVarious lawmakers have criticized of USDA\u2019s trade aid program but haven\u2019t ever taken steps to block payouts. Agricultural producers have borne the brunt of retaliation from China since Trump launched his tariff fight with Beijing in 2018.\n\nGovernment support for farmers, including trade aid, is one of the biggest factors propping up farmers\u2019 net income in 2019, after five years of decline.\n\nHollander said the continuing resolution being circulated is not final and could be changed before it\u2019s filed or voted on.\n\nThe House is expected to vote next week on the short-term stopgap. The Senate would also need to approve the bill, and Trump will ultimately have to sign it, so it\u2019s unclear if a CR that doesn\u2019t ensure payments can continue could become law.\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said Thursday that the committee is still \u201cputting the finishing touches\u201d on the spending bill, and there are \u201ca couple of issues that are still being discussed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not an issue that\u2019s been my responsibility right now,\u201d Lowey said of the trade aid provision. \u201cThere are many discussions going on, and we hope to keep this bill as clean as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the Democrats\u2019 potential plan on Thursday.\n\nMegan Cassella contributed to this report.", "description": "The payments have helped prop up farmers who have borne the brunt of retaliatory action by China during the trade war.", "authors": ["Ryan Mccrimmon"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2d/91/d0bfbb6a46dcbcb6efc65da356d0/190326-agriculture-gty-773.jpg"}
