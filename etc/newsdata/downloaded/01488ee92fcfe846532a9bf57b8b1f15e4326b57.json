The state board of elections ruled Kemp the victor by fewer than 55,000 votes.\n\n\u201cI've talked to hundreds of people who've had stories about how they were denied the right to vote, how it was made difficult for them to speak in their democracy,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cBut more than that, I understand that it's not just about me. When elections are about politicians, it's one and done. If you win, you lose, people move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when we remember that elections are about people,\u201d she continued, \u201cthat it's not a question of what I got, it's a question of what people were asking for, then my responsibility is not to make my life easier by doing the dance that politicians are taught to do.\u201d\n\nStacey Abrams at The Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga.

David Perdue, R-Ga., who is set to also run alongside the Republican nominee in a special election for Georgia\u2019s other Senate seat. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., is planning on stepping down in December and a temporary replacement with be named until the November elections.\n\nBut Abrams told Yahoo News she wasn\u2019t likely to endorse a candidate in either election until the state\u2019s Democratic primary voters had their say. And despite urging from some Democrats, she insisted she wouldn\u2019t run for either seat herself.\n\n\"There are two reasons I'm not running for the Senate. No. 1, I don't want to. I appreciate the importance of the deliberative bodies, but my passion, my energy, is in execution,\" she said. \"I believe we have to win those seats. But I don't have to be the person to do it,\" she added.\n\nPoint No. 2, she said, is: \"I believe that any candidate who's willing to be authentic and intentional and invest in every vote, that we can have a Democrat win both seats in 2020.\"\n\nAbrams has launched Fair Count, a nonprofit dedicated to including in the census Georgia\u2019s historically \u201chard-to-count populations,\u201d such as people of color, non-English speakers and renters.\n\nAbrams argued that a fair count of communities of color is not solely based on \u201ctrying to erase how the Trump administration is trying to diminish [them]\u201d, but on \u201cresources that get forfeited.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don't count black men in Georgia, for example,\u201d she said, \u201cif the predicted undercount happens, it's $150 million a year that is lost in the state. That's real money. That's health care. That's access to education.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Abrams says her mission is to instill trust in democracy for communities that are disenfranchised and marginalized.\n\n\u201cI want to make certain that we win the House, the Senate, and the presidency,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the only way we solve and tackle those massive policy issues \u2014 whether it's mass incarceration, climate change, poverty, education \u2014 we have to have people in office who trust and believe in America. And we don't have that right now.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Stacey Abrams lost her 2018 bid for Georgia governor against Brian Kemp.
