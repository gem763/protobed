Tannehill was sacked four times and picked off by Kareem Jackson on Tennessee\u2019s final drive, which reached the Denver 5-yard line before two offensive penalties and a sack pushed the Titans back to the 30-yard line.\n\nThe Titans (2-4) lost for the fourth time in five games.\n\nThe Broncos, who haven\u2019t allowed a touchdown in nine quarters, host Kansas City (4-2) on Thursday night with the chance to get back into the AFC West race after starting the Vic Fangio era with four frustrating losses.\n\nMariota came into the game as the NFL\u2019s only QB who had started every game and hadn\u2019t lost a fumble or been intercepted - although he had been sacked 22 times.\n\nBoth Denver and Tennessee were 2 of 14 on third down, leading to 17 punts.\n\nThe first half featured more flags (10) and punts (11) than points (six).\n\nThe Broncos took a shutout into the locker room for the second straight week. Last time, it was a 17-0 cushion against the Chargers; this time it was just 6-0 on a pair of Brandon McManus field goals, one of which snapped his streak of seven consecutive misses from 50 yards or more.\n\nBoth teams bungled their way through the first two quarters.\n\nThe Broncos were whistled for eight penalties and being forced to call two timeouts on special teams. The first was with 10 men on a punt by the Titans and the second one was because the play clock was at 1 second just before McManus\u2019 53-yarder.\n\nMariota threw his first interception of the season - to Harris, the 20th of his career but first this season. On Harris\u2019 runback, Denver defensive end Derek Wolfe was flagged for an illegal block.\n\nMariota\u2019s second interception came when he stepped up to avoid another sack and lofted a pass down the middle to Darius Jennings that was picked off by safety Justin Simmons at midfield.\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\nAt halftime, Pro Football Hall of Fame president David Baker presented Hall of Fame rings to Champ Bailey and the family of late owner Pat Bowlen. Also, Bailey was inducted as the 33rd member of the team\u2019s Ring of Fame. At a ceremony unveiling his 8-foot bronze pillar Friday night, Bailey chimed in on the current state of the Broncos, saying,\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just growing pains. There are a lot of new people around here, a good young corps, but I expect them to turn around. That\u2019s the good thing about here, we don\u2019t stay down long.\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\nTitans ILB Jayon Brown (groin) left the game on Tennessee\u2019s second defensive snap.\n\nBroncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders sat out the second half with a knee injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTitans: Host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\nBroncos: Host the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Denver Broncos' swarming defense sent Marcus Mariota to the bench and the Tennessee Titans to their fourth loss in five games with a 16-0 win Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/titans_broncos_football_23446_c0-204-4895-3059_s1200x700.jpg?8b97c584551911a75ef1791227739dcc0078080e", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
