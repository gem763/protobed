The answer that Trump just as surely doesn\u2019t want to hear, however, is this: It\u2019s not just one whistle-blower anymore.\n\nThe president now finds himself virtually surrounded by them, as one official after another treks to Capitol Hill to accuse Trump of putting his own political interests ahead of the nation\u2019s. The clamor is powering the congressional impeachment investigation that Trump has failed to thwart, and that now threatens his presidency.\n\nWilliam Taylor, Trump\u2019s own envoy to Ukraine, yesterday became the latest senior official to cry foul over wrongdoing at the highest levels of the president\u2019s administration. In closed-door testimony to three congressional committees, the veteran diplomat detailed how a pressure campaign directed by the president sought to tie U.S. aid to Ukraine to the public announcement of a Ukrainian investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. It was the most damaging account yet of a quid pro quo, that despite denials from Trump and his lieutenants, fits the very definition of the term.\n\nIn telling his story to Congress, Taylor joined a procession of current and former administration officials who have both backed up and expanded far beyond the initial allegations from an anonymous whistle-blower that set off the impeachment inquiry. Fiona Hill, the former director of European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, told House investigators that the maneuvering in Ukraine by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, had prompted her boss, then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, to alert White House attorneys and liken Giuliani\u2019s machinations to \u201ca drug deal.\u201d Kurt Volker, another top diplomat in Ukraine, reportedly testified that he personally told the country\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that he needed to publicly commit to a probe of corruption and the 2016 election in order to secure a face-to-face meeting with Trump. Taylor\u2019s predecessor, Marie Yovanovitch, detailed how she was abruptly removed from her post as ambassador to Ukraine after a concerted effort by Giuliani to attack her as disloyal to the president.", "description": "William Taylor is the latest in a procession of Trump-administration officials to cry foul on the president.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2SAN3/facebook.jpg?1571840886", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
