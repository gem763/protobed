He rang the Ibiza Rocks Hotel and discovered that no bookings had been made.\n\n'It became clear the Jet2 booking confirmation form was a fake document and it was then that Mr Mahone tried to ring Miss Doran on her mobile phone but she did not answer initially.\n\n'Later in the day Miss Doran phoned him wanting to talk and he told her to leave him alone as he wanted nothing to do with her. She texted him later and told him, erroneously, that she was pregnant.'\n\nA victim impact statement from Mr Mahone was read out in court in which he described his devastation at discovering his fiancee's dishonesty.\n\nMr Mahone said: 'I felt so let down. I trusted her and was getting ready to settle down and spend the rest of my life with her.\n\n'I loved her at the time and I have not been able to move on because I cannot trust anyone else in the way I trusted Rachel.\n\n'I am trying to move on but I find it difficult to talk to women because I am scared of getting hurt.\n\n'My friends are gutted, they don't want the money back, they just want justice done. My friends could have turned on me but they didn't.\n\nNine of the friends decided to go away anyway and booked themselves on a flight to Magaluf to make the best of a bad situation\n\n'I don't want to see Rachel again I just want some closure. Maybe when she has been sentenced I will regain some of my confidence and kickstart my life again. I want Rachel to learn from what she has done.'\n\nDoran was unable to tell police what she had done with the money but said she had been getting 'deeper and deeper' into debt.\n\nKim Whittlestone, mitigating, said Doran was of previous good character although she had received cautions for shoplifting in 2003.\n\nShe said: 'This was a relationship which was extremely positive in the beginning in which they were both striving to have a stable family life.\n\n'Unfortunately during the course of that relationship in the short period of time of 14 months she suffered a number of miscarriages and the impact on her mental health was significant. During that time she was seeking to please others to bolster her own self worth.'\n\nShe said that Doran's family had disowned her, that her relationship had been destroyed by her offending and she ended up in a hostel where she had made a 'serious attempt' to take her own life.\n\nMs Whittlestone told the court that she had in fact been pregnant as she told Mr Mahone but had terminated the pregnancy.\n\nJudge Nicholas Barker told Doran: 'You have acted in a deceitful and callous way. You must have known this would be found out and would come crashing down around you.\n\n'It cannot be said this was spur of the moment offending because it happened in a drip drip fashion, furthermore you produced the false tickets, a deceitful act designed to hide what you had done.'\n\nHe continued: 'You did all of this at a time you were preparing for your marriage. The real victim was your fiance, Mr Mahone, who now bears the memory that the woman he was to commit himself to in marriage had lied to him, to his best friends and to his family.\n\n'This has caused him to question his judgement and describes his confidence has been knocked and he has difficulties with trust as the result of what you did.'\n\nHe spared Doran jail, suspending her 15 month sentence for two years, imposed 20 rehabilitation activity days and 240 hours of unpaid work.\n\nJudge Barker also ordered that she repay \u00a33,600 in compensation to be split equally by the stag party from her wages of \u00a3316 per month at a factory near her new home in Egremont, Cumbria, which she hares with a new partner.\n\nNine of Mr Mahone's friends spent \u00a3400 each on a spontaneous trip in a bid to 'make the best out of a bad situation' when they realised they'd been cheated.\n\nBut Mr Mahone himself was not in the mood to join his friends and instead returned home to Cumbria.\n\nOne of the revellers on the trip told MailOnline: 'After we found out about the holiday we went inside the airport, went to the desk and asked if there were any flights to Benidorm or Magaluf.\n\n'They offered us \u00a3150 return so we said \"f*** it, we're off to Magaluf\". To be honest we haven't even booked a flight back.\n\n'We're just drinking loads all day today. Chris is the nicest person in the world, I just can't believe it's happened to him.\n\n'People back home are absolutely devastated. We're just trying to make the best out of a bad situation. We're devastated like.'", "description": "Chris Mahone was heartbroken when he and his friends found themselves unable to fly to Ibiza when they arrived at Leeds Bradford airport with fake Jet2 documents courtesy of Rachel Doran.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20332160-0-image-a-110_1572362070215.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
