But while the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and others are still saying there are multiple reasons why these products could be hurting people, health officials in New York have pointed to one ingredient in particular: vitamin E oil.\n\nIn a press conference Saturday, CDC officials provided an update on the situation. There were 450 suspected or confirmed cases reported to the CDC as of Friday.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the first state to report the cluster back in July, there have been 34 confirmed cases, with an additional 12 being investigated. Illinois, with 49 currently confirmed or suspected cases, was the first state to report a death likely linked to vaping.\n\nOn Thursday, health officials in Oregon reported that a middle-aged man with severe respiratory disease linked to vaping succumbed to his injuries in July, and on Saturday, another death was reported by Indiana officials. Yet another death possibly related to vaping is also being investigated, according to the CDC.\n\nThe condition still has no official name, but the CDC has created a standard guideline definition for doctors to diagnose and report cases. Sufferers are said to experience worsening symptoms like cough, fatigue, and trouble breathing in the days and weeks following vaping, while some have also had stomach issues like vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nNearly all of the victims have been hospitalised, sometimes for weeks at a time, and some have had ongoing heart and lung problems even after treatment. In many cases, their lungs also have evidence of lipid pneumonia, a type of inflammation linked to inhaling oils.\n\nIn its briefing on Friday, CDC officials again stressed these cases aren\u2019t tied to a single e-cigarette product or ingredient. But a majority of victims have reported using products containing THC, such as waxes and oils that are heated and inhaled. Oftentimes, people have bought these products off the black market rather than through legal vape shops. These products have included counterfeit versions of cannabis-containing e-cigarettes available in some states where recreational cannabis is legal.\n\nOn Friday, the New York State Department of Health announced an update on its own investigation, stating that officials had detected vitamin E acetate \u2014 an oily form of the vitamin commonly used in skin creams or supplements \u2014 in nearly all of their samples of products containing cannabis or THC that had been used by sick patients.\n\nThe agency said vitamin E would now be a key focus of its investigation. Also on Friday, the Washington Post reported that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found vitamin E in THC-containing products taken from patients across the country.\n\nAccording to Sven-Eric Jordt, a Duke University researcher who has studied the potential harms of nicotine vaping, vitamin E has never turned up in the \u201cregular\u201d nicotine products that he or other researchers have studied. Nor does vitamin E appear to have been found in any of the legal nicotine-based e-cigarettes taken from patients.\n\nThat means there\u2019s little research on how vitamin E could affect our lungs when heated and inhaled. But there\u2019s definitely a reason to think its effects on the lung could be disastrous, even if it\u2019s safe to apply on our skin.\n\n\u201cIf inhaled at sufficient amounts, it could certainly cause respiratory problems, maybe even lipid pneumonia, a lung inflammation associated with inhalation of oils,\u201d he told Gizmodo via email. \u201cIt is an antioxidant, and may burn and disintegrate when heated in an e-cigarette, releasing toxicants.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear at this point, though, is exactly why vitamin E is in these products. Jordt noted some vitamin E is naturally found in cannabis, so there\u2019s a chance the compound can be found in the largely unaltered cannabis oil that many vaping products use.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, it is entirely possible that the illegal products contained added vitamin E acetate to increase volume or dissolve THC/CBD better \u2014 or that a skin care oil was mixed in,\u201d he added. \u201cFor example, there are many CBD skin care oils marketed online that contain vitamin E acetate and other oils in addition to CBD.\u201d\n\nThere are still many unanswered questions, though. Black market products are now a common link between patients, but there are a minority of sickened people who reported using only nicotine products (of course, it\u2019s possible these patients are reluctant to admit cannabis or THC use). In the Oregon death, the patient did report using cannabis oil, but it was purchased from a legal vape shop.\n\nOne major problem is that e-cigarette liquid can contain such a large number of ingredients, especially if it\u2019s illicitly made. We\u2019re still barely scratching the surface of how these chemicals interact with one another or our lungs.\n\nJordt pointed out that some companies \u2014 billing themselves as the healthy alternative to nicotine vaping \u2014 are selling e-cigarette products that explicitly let people vape vitamins, including vitamin E. Neither the CDC nor other health agencies have implicated these kinds of products in the illness cluster, but regardless, it\u2019ll take a long time before we can be sure of what any of these products can do to our health.\n\nIn the meantime, the CDC has one clear piece of advice: Avoid buying any vaping products sold on the street.", "description": "The number of people stricken by acute lung disease linked to e-cigarettes continues to grow, with nearly 500 suspected cases reported across the U.S. as of this week, along with two more deaths in Oregon and Indiana.
