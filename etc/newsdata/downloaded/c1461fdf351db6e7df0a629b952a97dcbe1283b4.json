Times Internet also participated in the latest funding round.\n\nMX Player will use the funds to enhance its content portfolio by acquiring and providing original programming. It will also expand to other genres and increase its talent pool.\n\nThe company\u2019s valuation, after Tencent\u2019s funding, stands at $500 million (around Rs 3,550.67 crore), The Economic Times reported.\n\nVCCircle has reached out to MX Player on the details of the investment and will update the story accordingly.\n\nBCCL, Times Internet and the digital segment\n\nThe acquisition of MX Player for $147 million (around Rs 1,000 crore) by Times Internet last year marked the biggest transaction by Bennett, Coleman and Company Ltd (BCCL) at that time.\n\nThe privately-held BCCL \u2013 which also owns properties such as The Economic Times and The Times of India \u2013 has until recently avoided using external investors for capital raising. The strategy, however, changed with music-streaming service Gaana, which in February last year raised $115 million (around Rs 748 crore). That round was also led by Tencent.\n\nGajwani said MX Player was playing an important role in Times Internet\u2019s strategy of becoming the largest consumer platform in India, and the OTT service has the potential to change the consumption of mobile entertainment in the country.\n\nBCCL is no stranger to making aggressive moves in the digital segment to capture market share. It acquired radio network Virgin Radio in 2008. However, the investment was not successful for the Mumbai-based media group, and Virgin was sold to a Bauer Media Group division in 2013.\n\nMedia reports at that time pegged the deal value at around \u00a322 million ($33.5 million or Rs 204 crore). This would mean that BCCL exited Virgin Radio (which was later renamed Absolute Radio) at about half of the \u00a353.2 million (Rs 445 crore or $100 million) it paid to acquire it.\n\nOther properties in TIL\u2019s portfolio include cricket news portal Cricbuzz, restaurant reservation platform Dineout, personal finance platform ET Money.\n\nThe state of India\u2019s OTT segment\n\nPerhaps the biggest contributor to the rise of OTT services and content production in India has been the advent of cheap mobile data packages, which was hastened by Reliance Industries\u2019 aggressive launch and marketing of telecommunications service Jio.\n\nServices such as Amazon's Prime Video, Netflix and Star India\u2019s Hotstar have raced to capture consumer attention through a mix of original programming and signing deals with production houses for existing properties. The three have also concentrated on expanding their base to regional content in an effort to appeal to the broader section of India\u2019s population.\n\nBeyond these three, there are other platforms which are trying to carve a niche for themselves in the segment. For instance, The Viral Fever in May this year raised an additional $5 million (around Rs 34 crore) from existing investor Tiger Global Management.\n\nSimilarly, in July this year, digital entertainment startup Pocket Aces Pictures Pvt. Ltd raised Rs 100 crore (about $14.5 million) from Sequoia Capital India, DSP Group and 3one4 Capital, among others.", "description": "MX Player, the over-the-top (OTT) video platform that was acquired by Times Internet Ltd (TIL) last year, has raised $110.8 million", "authors": ["Narinder Kapur"], "top_image": "https://assets.vccircle.com/uploads/2019/08/fundingSJ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
