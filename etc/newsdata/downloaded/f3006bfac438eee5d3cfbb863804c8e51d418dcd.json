He had said the VA was \u201cthe most corrupt\u201d and \u201cprobably the most incompetently run\u201d Cabinet department. Democrats and major veterans\u2019 groups oppose \u201cprivatization\u201d and say VA facilities are best-suited to treat battlefield injuries such as post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAt the meeting, Trump asked whether \u201cwe should begin to close the VAs,\u201d according to the book. Legislation prohibited that, so Shulkin responded that the VA was working with Congress to set up a system-wide review to address underperforming facilities, whether by fixing or closing.\n\n\u201cBut this takes time,\u201d Shulkin said.\n\nTrump exclaimed, \u201cSo let\u2019s just do an executive order!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a legislative issue,\u201d Shulkin said.\n\nTrump then offered, \u201cCan\u2019t we just declare a national emergency?\u201d\n\nAt that point, according to the book, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, chimed in, \u201cYes. We\u2019re still in a war, so we could.\u201d\n\nShulkin told the AP that ultimately he dissuaded Trump from pursuing that route, persuading him to sign executive orders for changes with wider support, such as expanded telehealth options for veterans.\n\nThe 2017 Oval Office conversation is illustrative of Trump\u2019s early intentions toward the VA and remains significant as he pushes for reelection, citing in part his accomplishments in expanding Choice and boosting mental health care for veterans. Veterans as a group have largely backed Trump throughout his presidency, despite lingering questions about his intentions about preserving the VA.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email: \u201cWhile the former VA secretary chooses to profit off his time in office and share outlandish claims about his private conversations with the President, President Trump remains focused on ensuring veterans receive the care they have earned through their incredible sacrifice for our Nation.\u201d\n\nShulkin, a former Obama administration official, was fired by Trump in March 2018 amid an ethics scandal over a trip to Europe that Shulkin took with his wife that mixed business and pleasure, as well as mounting rebellion by political appointees in his agency. His book, \u201cIt Shouldn\u2019t Be This Hard to Serve Your Country,\u201d will be released next Tuesday.\n\nHe said the expansion of the Veterans Choice program under his successor, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie , has put the agency at risk \u201cas never before.\u201d Shulkin cited political forces inside and outside the administration that are more interested in putting \u201ccompanies with profits\u201d over the care of veterans, and suggested that only new leadership \u2014 at the department, probably at the White House, too \u2014 could save VA.\n\nYet, as VA secretary, Shulkin pushed a plan to give veterans wider access to doctors outside the VA medical system. Veterans should get \u201cmore choice in the say of their care,\u201d he told the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee in October 2017. \u201cNobody should feel trapped in the VA system.\u201d\n\nShulkin says Trump\u2019s plans regarding \u201cprivatization\u201d were still an open question when Shulkin was fired.\n\nA few weeks before, Shulkin said he was explaining to Trump in an Oval Office meeting why an aggressive expansion of private care for veterans could be very costly for the government, at more than $50 billion. Trump decided to call Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator who was once considered for the VA secretary job , to ask his opinion. \u201cWe can find the money from within the VA,\u201d Hegseth told Trump, according to the book, suggesting significant cuts to VA care.\n\n\u201cMuch of my narrative deals with the factions pushing me to simply close the VA or at least large parts of it that weren\u2019t working well,\u201d Shulkin wrote. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t see how shutting down a system specifically designed to care for veterans could be in the veterans\u2019 best interests.\u201d\n\nThe legislation that Trump ultimately signed last year gives veterans more freedom to see doctors outside the VA in an effort to cut wait times, paving the way for new rules that Shulkin says will \u201clead to the rapid dismantling of the current VA system.\u201d Recent studies have actually found that veterans got into a VA facility for an appointment faster on average and received better care than if they went to a private facility, raising questions about the value of steering veterans to the private sector if it results in inferior care.\n\nThe legislation expanding the Choice program includes a provision for a presidentially appointed commission to be set up in 2021, after voters elected the next president, to compile a list of VA facilities nationwide to be closed or reconfigured. If the president approves, closures would then begin unless Congress voted down the entire list, giving lawmakers no input on individual facilities to be added or removed. Wilkie in recent months has been urging Congress to pass legislation to allow the commission to start before the November 2020 election, citing market assessments the VA will have completed by then to judge which facilities to keep. Wilkie insists he\u2019s opposed to privatizing VA.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that the path now chosen, if allowed to continue, will leave veterans with fewer options, a severely weakened VA, and a private health care system not designed to meet the complex requirements of high-need veterans,\u201d Shulkin wrote.", "description": "Eager for changes at the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Donald Trump toyed early on with issuing an executive order to close parts of the VA...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GD743_shulki_ZG_20180214113456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
