Trump Tied Ukraine Funding to an Investigation of the DNC, Says Mick Mulvaney", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump\u2019s desire for Ukraine to investigate a conspiracy involving the Democratic National Committee and the 2016 elections was part of the reason military aid was held up, White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday.\n\nThe moment captured a stark admission by President Trump\u2019s top White House aide that Trump took political considerations into account when deciding funding to a country the U.S. and allies have relied on in the past to counter Russia. Mulvaney insisted linking the aid was \u201cabsolutely appropriate\u201d and went further to say that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied there was a quid pro quo when it came to Ukraine military funding and Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgement seemed to run counter to Trump\u2019s comments.\n\nU.S. leaders have long tried to separate the appearance of political calculations from foreign policy actions, at least in public remarks. The Trump administration is turning that playbook on its head and saying that such actions are appropriate.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the things he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters in the White House briefing room. In response to a question about whether the White House told Ukraine that funding will not flow to the unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well, Mulvaney said: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nMulvaney confirmed that Trump had also brought up the debunked conspiracy that Ukrainian individuals were involved in the investigation into the Russian hacking of the DNC server in 2016. There was no such involvement. \u201cDid he also mention to me in [the] past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\u201d Mulvaney said of a conversation he had with Trump. \u201cNo question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nPolitical influence in foreign policy is \u201cgoing to happen,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d said Mulvaney. \u201cThat is going to happen. Elections have consequences, and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\u201d One consequence \u2014 domestic politics bleeding into Trump\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 has now spilled into the open.", "description": "Trump has denied there was a quid pro quo when it came to Ukraine military funding", "authors": ["Brian Bennett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1STPl7ibulvtyPp9ZbM9JA--~B/aD03MTE7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/784de15b471b3ba29064cf29c5f33fbf", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
