The \u201ceducational parody\u201d is helping launch the space agency\u2019s new mission to get the first woman, and the next man, on the Moon by 2024.\n\nInterested in NASA? Add NASA as an interest to stay up to date on the latest NASA news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nMore than a dozen NASA interns rewrote and remixed Ariana Grande\u2019s aptly-named song \u201cNASA\u201d from her 2019 album \u201cThank U, Next.\u201d The space agency posted the video to its page Sunday and to YouTube last Thursday. NASA said it hopes the video will revive excitement in deep space exploration.\n\n\u201cThrough the agency\u2019s Artemis lunar exploration program, we will use innovative new technologies and systems to explore more of the Moon than ever before \u2026 Then we will use what we learn on and around the Moon to take the next giant leap \u2013 sending astronauts to Mars,\u201d NASA stated on YouTube.\n\nThe Artemis program, launched last spring, serves as a \u201csister program\u201d to the original Apollo program. According to NASA\u2019s website, the program will incorporate the agency\u2019s new rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, as well as the Orion spacecraft and Gateway spaceship.\n\nAlexis Vance, a NASA intern and student at Oklahoma State University, starred in and co-produced the video. She said interns hoped the video would promote interest in NASA\u2019s new initiative.\n\n\u201cDoing this we hope to not only provide some entertainment to the public but just kind of fire people up about our Moon to Mars mission and about the Artemis program,\u201d Vance said.\n\nShe also said the online buzz had meant a lot to her and her fellow interns. Even Ariana Grande retweeted the students\u2019 video.\n\noh my. this is so pure and special and insane. hi everyone over there that is doing such incredible work ! thank u for taking the time to make this ! my heart is ..... bursting. \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf2b\ud83d\udda4 https://t.co/o48OzSSTcD \u2014 Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cAll of the interns are definitely pumped \u2026 this is something we worked on for a very long time,\u201d Vance said.\n\nVance added that producing educational videos has become a tradition for NASA interns. In addition to their regular duties as young engineers, the group of interns learned how to write songs, edit videos and record in an audio booth for their version of \u201cNASA.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad to share the message of our mission, and I\u2019m glad that a lot of people are having fun with it. It\u2019s bringing them as much joy as it brought us to make the video,\u201d Vance said.\n\nFor would-be astronauts and singers, NASA is now accepting intern applications.", "description": "The \u201ceducational parody\u201d is helping launch NASA's new mission to get the first woman, and the next man, on the Moon by 2024.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/NASAinterns_190909_CA_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
