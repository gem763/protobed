By the time the referee\u2019s whistle was blown in Yokohama, confirming Japan\u2019s first-ever quarter-final berth at a Rugby World Cup, the death toll had risen. More lives lost in the rain and dirt. Five days later, that figure now stands at 74, with many others still missing. Typhoon Hagibis has left its mark.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Japan, led by the commanding Leitch, take on South Africa in Tokyo. The circumstances have made for something unique on these shores. Although the nation is no stranger to natural disasters, rarely has a sporting narrative of this stature and significance found itself caught in the crosshairs, with the hosts now within reaching distance of the last four.\n\nAt a time of so much suffering and pain and loss, what place does sport have in the conversation? How can the drama, the intricacies, the ebbs and flows of one rugby match alleviate the agony of those lives which have been shaken in the storm? Is it not best to separate the two? Japan were forced to grapple with such questions in the late hours of Saturday evening and the rising light of Sunday morning.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

You could see it in the stands and on the faces of the fans. Ahead of kick-off, as the national anthem rose to its climax, ceremonial and almost harrowing in tone, many clad in red and white were reduced to tears. With so many threads to the tale \u2013 the devastation wrought by Hagibis, the eventual deliverance of Sunday\u2019s match, the agony and ecstasy that awaited the two sides \u2013 the emotion of the occasion was unprecedented: charged, forceful, unlike anything those present had experienced before.\n\nAnd now, as the country comes to terms with the full scale of suffering carved out by one of the largest typhoons seen in decades, Jamie Joseph and his men must do it all again. The side may have weathered their own storm in Yokohama, but the reality for those affected by Hagibis has not changed in the days that have followed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Meanwhile, about 12,000 homes are still without electricity or have no running water. It\u2019s unclear how long it will take for utilities to restore full-working service. As of Wednesday afternoon, thousands remained in local evacuation centres \u2013 municipal buildings, sports halls, high schools \u2013 unable to clean up their homes.\n\nIn certain parts of Koriyama, an industrial hub in Fukushima Prefecture, the waters had risen high, reaching chest height in little more than an hour. To the east of the Abukuma River, which meanders through a number of cities in the prefecture, the damage was extensive. The neighbourhood of Suimoncho, nestled in a sunken-like bowl along the river, found itself engulfed once a three-metre high levee was breached. By dawn\u2019s break on Sunday, all that could be seen were the grey and brown rooftops.\n\nWith the floodwaters now gone, residents must prepare themselves for the long road ahead. Walking Suimoncho\u2019s streets, the scale of destruction is laid bare. Whole homes cleared of their possessions, left to rot or bake in the hot sun. Buildings wrapped in scaffolding. Debris scattered everywhere, caught in river reeds and trees bent forward by the storm\u2019s winds. The recovery efforts are already in full swing, with local officials suggesting it could take more than a month for a sense of normality to return.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been this much damage before,\u201d says Moe Kaneda, a teacher in Koriyama\u2019s city centre. \u201cThis is the first time ever.\u201d\n\nIn these parts, for now at least, any consideration beyond survival and recovery may well seem unnecessary. Anything that falls outside of those two instincts can often fade into irrelevance, lost as mere background noise. Joseph and the Japanese national side will know this. When they line up to face the Springboks on Sunday evening, there will be those hit by Hagibis who do not have the means or time or desire to watch this historic occasion. Yuki Yaginuma, a resident of Suimoncho, said that although he\u2019d been following Japan at the World Cup, he was \u201cunsure if I\u2019ll be able to see them\u201d given his circumstances.\n\nWhich only increases the significance of this weekend\u2019s quarter-final. Leitch and his players can deliver more than just glory and history. They can deliver hope. They can bring comfort, relief, a distraction of the welcoming kind.\n\nAnd against the South Africans, a team they famously stunned in 2015, they can do so in typically Japanese fashion: with injections of turbo-charged pace down the flanks, surges of rolling, uncontrollable interplay, fuelled by those lightning quick offloads, and an abundance of resilience \u2013 that quality which, more than any other, speaks loudest among the population during these times of adversity. \u201cPeople came together after the earthquake [in 2011], we will do the same,\u201d says Moe. \u201cMaybe the [Japanese rugby] team can help. They can give people hope.\u201d\n\nJapan, as a host and as a team, has already answered the call of duty \u2013 both to itself and the international game. Last weekend was testament to that. The character of the country, its people and players will be long remembered once the curtain falls on this tournament. What comes next, then, is infinitely more personal. For the individuals taking to the field in Tokyo, it\u2019s about serving those who have suffered under Hagibis and those alone. There is no expectation weighing down on this fixture. No historical burden. No controversy waiting in the wings, as with last weekend. For the hosts, this will be a night shared between its players and the nation \u2013 a night that, however briefly and regardless of the outcome, can lift spirits across the county.", "description": "With the rush and electricity of the previous 80 minutes still coursing through him, Michael Leitch\u2019s post-victory thoughts turned immediately to the victims. \u201cFor those suffering from the typhoon this was for you guys,\u201d he said pitch side as those in the Yokohama Stadium, bewitched by what they had seen, softened their voices to listen to the captain\u2019s solemn words.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/09/japan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
