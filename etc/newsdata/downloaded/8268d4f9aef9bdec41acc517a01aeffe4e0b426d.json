They ignored the suspicion that he was injury-prone and the reality that he had never faced the kind of scrutiny he would in the Bronx, and pulled the trigger. He was the shiny toy in the department store window they simply had to have. You\u2019d think they would have learned a lesson from the Jacoby Ellsbury fiasco.\n\nTo my mind, the Yankees had no discernible need for Stanton then.\n\nAnd it appears they have no discernible use for him now.\n\nAfter all, if Stanton didn\u2019t get off the bench to pinch-hit in the late stages of Sunday\u2019s Game 2 of the American League Championship Series, when the Yankees were struggling to manage more than a single off the Houston Astros bullpen, when exactly does he get off the bench this postseason?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe answer, of course, is probably never.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton looks on in game two of the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park on October 13, 2019 in Houston, Texas. (Getty Images)\n\nOn a conference call after Game 4 was rained out and postponed until Thursday night, Yankees manager Aaron Boone was still unable to commit to Stanton in his lineup for this crucial game in the series.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll have to see how his treatment goes today,\u2019\u2019 Boone said. \u201cI\u2019m not really close to making that decision yet. That\u2019ll be something that we kind of work through today and possibly into tomorrow before we make that decision.\u2019\u2019\n\nAsked how long the Yankees could afford to continue playing an ALCS with a 24-man roster, Boone said, \u201cThat\u2019ll be another conversation. Even though G hasn\u2019t been able to go yet, I do view him as a potential option off the bench in a hitting situation if we like something, so I don\u2019t view it as we\u2019re entirely 24 man right now. I do believe we have his bat off the bench right now. Whether a situation arises for that we\u2019ll see.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd yet, Boone found no spot for Stanton in Game 2, even though the score remained stuck at 2 for 5-\u00bd innings before Carlos Correa took J.A. Happ out of the park on the first pitch of the 11th inning, or in Game 3, when the entire Yankees lineup minus Torres struggled to get anything going against Gerritt Cole and a trio of Astros relievers.\n\nIf those aren\u2019t the kind of games that out scream for Stanton\u2019s bat, exactly what kind are?\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not going to use him, why continue to carry him on the roster?\n\nThese are questions as vexing as why the Yankees felt the need to acquire Stanton in the first place.\n\nThe biggest reason why the Yankees are reluctant to drop Stanton is the most obvious \u2014 under the rules, a player taken off a postseason roster due to injury is ineligible not only for the rest of that series, but the next series as well. That means Stanton would be ineligible for the Yankees\u2019 World Series roster, should they manage to get that far.\n\nBut what has Stanton shown you so far, either last October or this one, that his presence will make an appreciable difference in the Yankees\u2019 fortunes in this series or any other, or that his absence will even be noticed?\n\nStanton was booed during the pregame introductions before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium Tuesday, booed louder than any of the Astros not named Altuve or Verlander, and while the Bronx crowd is notorious for devouring its own, that reception told you something.\n\nThe Yankee fans have never really accepted Stanton, and they, too, seem to be wondering why he is even here.\n\nThe truth is that two years into his tenure, Stanton has made no real impact on the Yankees lineup or their fortunes. The team hit what would have been an MLB record (if not for those slugging Minnesota Twins) of 306 home runs. Out for most of the season with a variety of injuries, Stanton contributed three of them. Clearly, their offense did not need him to be fearsome this season.\n\nYes, he hit a solo home run off the soft-tossing Zack Greinke in Saturday\u2019s 7-0 Game 1 Yankees victory, but that was a comparatively low-pressure situation. It might be more useful to recall his 2018 ALDS against the Boston Red Sox, in which he managed to scratch out just four singles in 18 at-bats, or his final appearance of that series, a non-competitive at-bat in which he struck out against Craig Kimbrel with two runners on and the tying run on second base.\n\nHaving played his first eight seasons in the anonymity of Miami, the case could be made that that was the first and so far only truly important at-bat of Stanton\u2019s big-league career.\n\nBut with him being under contract to the Yankees until 2027 \u2014 don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for him to opt-out after next season \u2014 there will be plenty of important at-bats in his future.\n\nDo the Yankees really trust Stanton to take them?\n\nThey seemed not to on Sunday, nor in Tuesday\u2019s 4-1 Game 3 loss at Yankee Stadium, when there admittedly were only a handful of prospective spots for him \u2014 leading off the eighth in place of the struggling Edwin Encarnacion, or later in the same inning for the totally-lost Sanchez.\n\nThe fact that Boone has not used him since Game 1 tells you one of two things: Either his injury is worse than the Yankees are letting on, a reality that Stanton hinted at in a brief pregame scrum on Tuesday, or that the manager doesn\u2019t fully trust him in a tight spot.\n\nNeither answer is good. And with the Yankees down two games to one, now having to win at least one game in Houston, where the Astros had the best home record in baseball in 2019, and facing the prospect of having to beat Justin Verlander and Gerritt Cole, who are 1 and 1A in the AL Cy Young race, the time has come for hard decisions to be made.\n\nBut really, it should be an easy call.\n\nTime to replace Stanton on the roster with someone who can contribute, whether it\u2019s Luke Voit, Tyler Wade or even Clint Frazier.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make much sense to bring Stanton aboard two years ago. It makes even less to carry him along for the ride now.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "If the Yankees took Giancarlo Stanton off their roster, would he even be missed?", "authors": ["Wallace Matthews"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wta.dY.73qzoGzs8OOcYeA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ked0pmBWmUamBXJ4N9nRuw--~B/aD0zMjMzO3c9NDg1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c2f7e7a0-f04f-11e9-bbf5-bcb775aebb29", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
