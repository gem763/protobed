This is shocking!' one commented on Facebook.\n\n'OMG what the heck was she thinking? I would have followed her and called the police on her,' another wrote.\n\n'Can only pray the police have caught up with her,' someone commented.\n\nMichael Rickards, Policing Manager Acting Inspector for Waitemat\u0101 Police District, said they were aware of the video and were making inquiries with the registered owner of the car.\n\nThe woman was caught with her baby behind the wheel driving through a busy intersection in Auckland, New Zealand (pictured)\n\n'Sadly, this video is a prime example of poor decision-making behind the wheel,' Inspector Rickards told the New Zealand Herald.\n\n'Nearly a third of people who die on New Zealand roads are not wearing seat belts. It's a really simple message \u2013 restraints save lives.\n\n'Being properly restrained is important for all occupants of a vehicle, including children. Even in a low speed impact it can cause a great deal of harm to an unrestrained child.'\n\nAll children under seven must be restrained when travelling in cars in New Zealand.\n\nDrivers who break these rules will receive a NZ$150 fine.", "description": "The woman was caught with her baby behind the wheel driving through a busy intersection in Auckland, New Zealand.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/06/20268590-0-image-a-39_1572242632609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
