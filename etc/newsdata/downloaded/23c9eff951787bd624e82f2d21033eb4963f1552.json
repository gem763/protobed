Around 12:30 a.m., Hardy must have heard something in the parking lot that got his attention, because he stepped away from his post to investigate so quickly that he left a cigarette burning in an ashtray. Within seconds, a shot rang out, sending a bullet through Hardy\u2019s hand, and then his mouth. A second bullet ensured his fate. Either between the shots or after them, Hardy staggered about 30 feet, leaving a trail of blood and teeth on the asphalt. Witnesses gave a variety of descriptions of the car that sped away from the scene, but most described it as a late model and light-colored.\n\nHardy, a black officer, was well-liked both in the sheriff\u2019s department and in the community. He was 49 years old and had served for 23 years. He left behind a wife and two children. As is often the case when a police officer is killed, Hardy\u2019s death shook the local community, and local law enforcement faced immediate and enormous pressure to find his killer. Police in Birmingham and the surrounding area pulled over countless vehicles on pretext stops that night. At the first preliminary hearing for the men initially arrested for Hardy\u2019s murder, more than 750 law enforcement officers showed up for support, forcing the judge to move the hearing to a larger courtroom. Alabama\u2019s governor would later announce a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nOver the next few years, six young black men and one black girl would be arrested for crimes associated with Hardy\u2019s murder. Four were charged. Two were tried \u2014 one was acquitted; one was convicted and sentenced to die. There was precious little evidence for any of the charges.\n\nThis is a story about a wrongful conviction. It\u2019s about witnesses who were rewarded for lies and threatened for telling the truth. It\u2019s about overly aggressive law enforcement, a supine judiciary and almost comically ineffective representation, and how all of these things put a man on death row who nearly everyone now agrees is innocent \u2014 even the man who prosecuted him now doubts his guilt. It\u2019s a story about the lives ruined along the way. And it\u2019s about the murder of a much-liked deputy that, because of all of this, remains unsolved.\n\nOne July night\n\nAt the time William Hardy was killed, Toforest Johnson, then 22, and his friend Ardragus Ford, 21, were partying at a nightclub called Tee\u2019s Place on the other side of Birmingham. Johnson\u2019s appellate attorneys would later provide 10 witnesses who saw him at the club. And at almost precisely the moment Hardy died, phone records show Ford had called a girl he met a few weeks earlier, 15-year-old Yolanda Chambers. The two men arranged to pick up Chambers and another girl, Latanya Henderson, at around 2 a.m. The four planned to get a bite to eat before checking in to a hotel.\n\nAround 4 a.m., a police officer approached the group in the parking lot of a Super 8 motel in the city of Homewood, about 5 miles south of Birmingham. The officer said he had been called about a \u201csuspicious vehicle.\u201d He patted down the four of them and searched the car. Police officials would later tell the four that they were questioned because law enforcement was on the lookout for Hardy\u2019s killers, though the car they were in \u2014 a black 1971 Monte Carlo fitted to accommodate a wheelchair \u2014 didn\u2019t fit the car most witnesses described fleeing the scene. The police found nothing suspicious and released Chambers, Ford and Henderson. Johnson, however, had an outstanding warrant for a traffic violation. He was arrested and taken to a city jail.\n\nA few years ago, I wrote about the case of Montez Spradley, another Birmingham, Ala., man who had been convicted and sentenced to death. In both Spradley\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s cases, witnesses came forward with damning information in response to a reward. In both cases, it seems safe to say that a conviction wouldn\u2019t have been possible without those witnesses. In both cases, the witnesses were paid, but the payments were never disclosed to the defense or the jury. In fact, in both cases, the judge signed off on said payments, yet neither judge bothered to notify defense counsel.\n\nCoincidentally, the judges in the two cases are siblings. Gloria Bahakel, the judge in Spradley\u2019s case, is the sister of the judge in Johnson\u2019s case, Alfred Bahakel. The Bahakels also have another sibling, Jerry, who was a Jefferson County deputy and a colleague of Hardy at the time Hardy was killed \u2014 a connection that Johnson\u2019s lawyers unsuccessfully argued was a conflict of interest. Jerry Bahakel was later fired from the Birmingham police department for using excessive force while arresting the daughter of the mayor of Birmingham. He later became a lawyer and also ran for judge, but lost.\n\nIn the investigations of both Johnson and Spradley, law enforcement officials threatened witnesses with incarceration and the loss of custody of their children if they didn\u2019t tell authorities the story they wanted to hear. And both cases were prosecuted by the office of longtime Jefferson County District Attorney David Barber, who held that position for 24 years. So far, at least six people convicted of murder during Barber\u2019s tenure have been exonerated, including four who at one time had been sentenced to die.\n\nTo the extent that there are differences between the two cases, they make Johnson\u2019s prosecution even worse. He had deficient attorneys and an incompetent investigator. The state tried him and his friend using two mutually exclusive theories of the crime. And then there\u2019s the biggest difference between Spradley and Johnson: Spradley was finally released from prison; Johnson is still on Alabama\u2019s death row.\n\nA star witness under pressure\n\nYolanda Chambers helped send one man to death row and almost sent another. She\u2019s the reason Toforest Johnson was arrested, and she was the chief witness against his friend, Ardragus Ford. At one point, prosecutors themselves conceded that since William Hardy\u2019s murder, Chambers had told more than 300 lies about who was involved and what she knew.\n\nHardy was a friend of the Chambers family, and the morning after the shooting, Chambers\u2019s mother called to ask whether she had heard the news. The girl said she had, and told her mother that she \u201cmight know something\u201d about what had happened. This likely referred to what police officers had told her and her friends the night before, but her mother seemed to have interpreted the answer to mean Chambers knew who committed the crime. The governor\u2019s office would soon announce a $10,000 reward for the apprehension of Hardy\u2019s killer. Chambers\u2019s mother hired an attorney to help her collect the reward, and she told police that the girl had information about Hardy\u2019s death.\n\nPolice investigators picked up Chambers and Latanya Henderson later that day. During intense questioning, both girls denied knowing anything about the murder. The stories they told police were nearly identical, and generally consistent with what we now know about the crime. But at the time, the police didn\u2019t believe them. The investigating officers threatened the girls with criminal charges for lying, then let them go. Later that day, the two met up at a hair salon. According to court records filed by Johnson\u2019s attorneys, Henderson vowed to her friend that she\u2019d tell the truth, even it meant arrest; Chambers replied that she\u2019d rather lie than go to jail.\n\nBoth girls appear to have stuck to their respective plans. Henderson continued to tell police she knew nothing about Hardy\u2019s death, and that she and her friends were nowhere near the Crown Sterling Suites that night. Despite the fact that her story could be corroborated with phone records, she was charged with hindering prosecution and sent to a juvenile detention facility. She remained there for months.\n\nAround 4 a.m., a police officer approached the group in the parking lot of a Super 8 motel in the city of Homewood. The police found nothing suspicious and released Chambers, Ford and Henderson. Johnson, however, had an outstanding warrant for a traffic violation. He was arrested and taken to a city jail.\n\nChambers was a different story. She first said Hardy had been killed by a man named \u201cMike,\u201d whom she described as 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, with a gold tooth. Then she blamed a man named Quentin McClain. He was arrested but then released when Chambers retracted that story, too. She then named a man named Reggie Richardson. He, too, was detained and then released when Chambers changed her story a third time. There would be more stories, yet the police still believed Chambers was their best lead in the high-profile murder of one of their own.\n\nChambers, meanwhile, was undoubtedly scared. She was spending most nights on the streets of Birmingham immersed in a life of prostitution and illicit drugs. Now this 15-year-old was in the impossible position of going to prison unless she gave the police something useful, and having nothing useful to give them. As each of her stories fell apart, the police grew more desperate and squeezed her a little harder until she implicated someone new. \u201cAll of the evidence, including phone records and witnesses, clearly showed that she couldn\u2019t have witnessed the Hardy murder,\u201d says Richard Jaffe, a longtime Alabama criminal defense attorney who represented Ford. \u201cHer accusations should have been painfully and obviously false.\u201d\n\nThe routine between Chambers and police continued until she finally described a scenario that didn\u2019t immediately clash with an alibi or contradict the known evidence. And that would be the story the police took to a grand jury.\n\nIn this version, Chambers said seven people were present at Hardy\u2019s murder: herself, Henderson, Johnson and Ford, along with three other men (Omar Berry, Leon Colvin and Quintez Wilson). She initially claimed they had met up to carry out a drug deal; she\u2019d later say it was to beat up a man who was staying at the hotel. In both versions, when Hardy showed up in the parking lot, Chambers said, Johnson panicked at the sight of a police officer, and shot him. Johnson then returned to Ford\u2019s car with blood on his hands, and everyone fled. (Police never found blood or any other physical evidence linking Johnson to the crime scene.) Birmingham police arrested everyone Chambers named.\n\nAt a preliminary hearing just a couple of months later, Chambers changed her story again. This time, she said it wasn\u2019t Johnson, but Berry and Wilson who killed Hardy. Four months later, the lead investigator for the sheriff\u2019s department would tell a grand jury yet another story \u2014 that according to Chambers, it was Berry and Ford who fired at Hardy. He also told the grand jury that while she might have been dishonest in the past, \u201cour investigation reveals there is no doubt that Yolanda Chambers is telling us the truth.\u201d\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t. Her story would change again. About a year later, Berry and Wilson passed polygraph tests. Around the same time, the police obtained surveillance video from the parking lot of the hotel. If Chambers had finally been telling the truth, the video should have shown Ardragus Ford\u2019s car around the time of the murder. It didn\u2019t. So Chambers altered her story again. She admitted to police that she had actually just met Berry and Wilson at a club a few nights earlier, and that they had nothing to do with the crime. Instead, she now claimed it was she, Henderson, Ford and Johnson who were in the parking lot, that Ford had parked out of view of the security cameras, and that Ford \u2014 and only Ford \u2014 shot and killed Hardy. Berry and Wilson were released from jail after being locked up for 15 months. Neither ever received an apology from law enforcement officials.\n\nUndeterred, prosecutors finally charged Ford and Johnson with capital murder, making each eligible for the death penalty. Ford\u2019s mother retained Jaffe, a renowned attorney who had represented multiple Alabamians facing the death penalty. Johnson\u2019s family was poorer, and was assigned lawyers by the court.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Jaffe\u2019s investigators told him they had heard that Chambers had told friends she regretted implicating two innocent men for Hardy\u2019s murder. Jaffe requested a hearing and questioned Chambers under oath. During that questioning, Chambers returned to her original story. She said she knew nothing about the crime, that she had never been at the hotel that night, and that neither had any of the people she was with. When Jaffe asked her why she had previously lied, she replied: \u201cBecause the pressure. They was telling me, you know, \u2018Don\u2019t you know you can go to jail for this?\u2019 And that\u2019s all I was thinking. That\u2019s all I had put in my mind: Jail. I don\u2019t want to go. So after they was putting all the pressure on me, I went on and said I was there \u2026 maybe if I go on and say I was there, maybe all the threats and everything will end.\u201d\n\nLater, Jaffe asked her why she had specifically lied to implicate Ford and Johnson. She replied, \u201cBecause, I mean, that\u2019s what they wanted to hear, that Ardragus was the one who killed the police officer.\u201d\n\nSuch an admission from the state\u2019s star witness should have been a bombshell. Jaffe asked Judge Bahakel to find that the state had committed prosecutorial misconduct and that the charges against Ford be dropped. Bahakel declined.\n\nInstead, Jefferson County would hold separate trials in Hardy\u2019s murder: one for Ford and one for Johnson. In both cases, the state would seek the death penalty.\n\nTwo trials, two hung juries\n\nArdragus Ford\u2019s trial came first, in November 1997. It\u2019s worth noting that at several points during his interrogation and incarceration, Ford could have freed himself by implicating Toforest Johnson. In his 2012 book \u201cQuest for Justice,\u201d Jaffe writes that the police initially interrogated Ford for nine hours while Jaffe was tied up in a separate case. When he arrived at the police station, DA David Barber told Jaffe that he thought Ford was lying about knowing nothing about the shooting, but he also didn\u2019t think Ford was the killer.\n\n\u201cHe was there. We know that,\u201d Jaffe recounts Barber telling him. \u201cGo in there and see if you can talk some sense into him. Either you can leave with him as a witness or we are going to wheel him over to the Jefferson County Jail. It\u2019s up to him.\u201d\n\nJaffe got Barber to agree to complete immunity if Ford would implicate Johnson. But Ford wouldn\u2019t do it. Jaffe then recounts what Ford told him when he approached his client with the immunity deal: \u201cLook, Mr. Jaffe, Toforest and I are close, but not that close. I see where they won\u2019t charge me if I say he did it. If that were the truth, I would say it in a heartbeat. I would not lie for him and put my family through all these changes, including money to pay you to represent me. But I am not lying for anybody, including the cops.\u201d\n\nFord was arrested, jailed and charged with capital murder. Barber\u2019s office would be seeking the death penalty. Jaffe writes in his book: \u201cI have cross-examined many people who have lied to avoid a theft case. This young man faced the electric chair and refused to lie.\u201d\n\nAs the trial began, as far as Ford and Jaffe knew, the only evidence against him was the testimony of Yolanda Chambers. \u201cMy opening statement took over an hour,\u201d Jaffe says in a phone interview. \u201cTheirs was only about 15 minutes. Usually a prosecutor would tell the jury what testimony they were about to hear. They couldn\u2019t do that with Chambers because she was so unpredictable. They didn\u2019t know for sure what she would say. None of us did.\u201d\n\nBut the prosecution was also sitting on a surprise. After opening arguments, the state called a woman named Carla Bowen to the stand. Jaffe and his co-counsel were baffled. Prosecutors are supposed to give the defense a list of witnesses. Jaffe and his co-counsel had no idea who Bowen was. He objected. Prosecutors told the court that they had learned of Bowen only in the last few hours, and had no signed or recorded statements from her to give to the defense. That would later prove to be false, when Bowen revealed under questioning that law enforcement had previously questioned her in a recorded interview.\n\nBahakel granted a recess for the day so that Jaffe could review the recording. In it, according to Jaffe, Bowen said Ford had once come to her house with another teen, and the two watched an episode of \u201cMatlock.\u201d In the first part of the interview, she denied that Ford had ever said anything about Hardy\u2019s death. But then the prosecutor mentioned Bowen\u2019s children, and the possibility that she could lose them if she was charged for not coming forward sooner. That seemed to jog her memory. She quickly recalled that Ford had casually implicated himself in the shooting. Jaffe asked Bahakel to prevent Bowen from testifying. He refused.\n\nUsually a prosecutor would tell the jury what testimony they were about to hear. They couldn\u2019t do that with [Yolanda] Chambers because she was so unpredictable. They didn\u2019t know for sure what she would say. None of us did. Richard Jaffe, a longtime Alabama criminal defense attorney who represented Ardragus Ford\n\nThe main event at Ford\u2019s trial was Yolanda Chambers. She told the jury that she, Johnson, Ford and Latanya Henderson were in the parking lot of the hotel, and that Ford fired the fatal shots at Hardy. Prosecutors admitted to the jury that Chambers had lied in the past, but vouched for her integrity on the witness stand. \u201cShe didn\u2019t ask for this role,\u201d said deputy district attorney Jeff Wallace, \u201cbut she came in here and told you the truth.\u201d And she told the truth, he said, \u201cBecause she she\u2019s sitting there looking at Bill Hardy\u2019s family when she tells you what she saw that night.\u201d Chambers was telling the truth, prosecutors insisted. But they had also insisted she was telling the truth when they previously presented the media, the grand jury and the court with theories of the crime that were wholly inconsistent with the theory they were arguing now. And soon, in Johnson\u2019s trial, they\u2019d argue a completely different theory.\n\nIn spite of Wallace\u2019s efforts, the state\u2019s case against Ford just wasn\u2019t very strong. The jury hung, with a 10-2 vote in favor of acquittal.\n\nThe following month, jury selection began for Johnson\u2019s trial. The case against Johnson was nearly as weak as the case against Ford. And Chambers\u2019s most recent story \u2014 the one she had just given in court, under oath \u2014 was that Ford killed Hardy, with no help from anyone.\n\nBut after Ford\u2019s trial, prosecutors opted to use a piece of information against Johnson that they\u2019d had from nearly the beginning. In August 1995, just a couple weeks after the shooting, a woman named Violet Ellison told police that she had heard Johnson confess to Hardy\u2019s murder. At the time, Ellison\u2019s daughter was dating an inmate at the county jail. When he needed to make phone calls, the boyfriend would call Ellison\u2019s daughter from the jail phone, and she would then contact other parties through three-way calling. He would only be required to pay for one call. She began doing this for other inmates as well.\n\nAccording to Ellison, in August 1995 she picked up her phone after her daughter had arranged one of these calls and listened in on the conversation. She said she heard one of the parties on the line identify himself as \u201cToforest.\u201d She said that man then told the other party that he \u201cshot the f----r in the head,\u201d because the deputy was \u201cmessing in my s--t.\u201d According to Ellison, the man also said that Quintez Wilson fired the other shot.\n\nThe confession Ellison claimed to have heard didn\u2019t jibe with evidence showing that the bullets found at the crime scene were fired from the same gun. It also didn\u2019t jibe with either of the state\u2019s two competing theories of the crime \u2014 that either Ford or Johnson shot Hardy, with no help from the other. Odder still, Ellison first came forward with her allegation in August 1995, yet between then and Johnson\u2019s December 1997 trial, prosecutors advanced multiple other theories of the crime that directly contradicted the alleged confession. For example, in January 1996, five months after Ellison came forward, lead police investigator Anthony Richardson told a grand jury that the police believed Ford and Omar Berry fired the shots. Nine months later, the state dropped all charges against both Berry and Wilson.\n\nThere are other good reasons to doubt Ellison\u2019s claims. She knew Hardy and was a friend of his family. She was facing some financial hardship right at the time when both the state and the sheriff\u2019s offices were offering well-publicized $10,000 rewards. The Alabama governor\u2019s office announced the reward on Aug. 2, 1995; Ellison claims the incriminating phone call happened the very next day.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Ellison was telling the truth but had been duped. Other inmates at the time later told Johnson\u2019s appellate attorneys that one inmate had a habit of imitating his fellow inmates when he called women on the jail phone. According to them, Johnson was one of his go-to imitations. Ellison had never met or spoken to Johnson, so she wouldn\u2019t have known the sound of his voice.\n\n\n\nA copy of the check cut to Violet Ellison\n\nIn 2003, Johnson\u2019s appellate attorneys learned that the state of Alabama paid Ellison $5,000 in 2001 for her assistance to the prosecution. It isn\u2019t clear why it took so long for her to receive payment, but in other cases (such as Montez Spradley\u2019s), such rewards have been contingent on the state winning a conviction that holds up on direct appeal.\n\nBut the state still hadn\u2019t turned over the check itself, or any records associated with it. In January, more than 20 years after Johnson was tried, the state finally turned over a copy of the check, as well as a form signed by Judge Bahakel authorizing the payment, emails between state officials about the reward, and an August 2001 letter from DA David Barber to the Alabama governor\u2019s office requesting Ellison\u2019s reward. Prosecutors said these documents had been \u201cmisfiled,\u201d and only recently discovered.\n\nIn his letter to the governor\u2019s office, Barber wrote that Ellison came forward \"pursuant to the public offer of a reward.\u201d That\u2019s significant, because at trial prosecutors summarizing Ellison\u2019s testimony told the jury that she had come forward solely because of \u201cher conscience\u201d and so that she \u201ccan sleep at night.\u201d At a hearing this year, Ellison testified that contrary to Barber\u2019s letter, she knew nothing about the reward when she came forward, or even during the three times she testified (she testified at Johnson\u2019s two trials, as well as at a hearing). She claimed she learned of the money only in August 2001.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that Ellison came forward both because she wanted to catch a killer and she wanted the reward. But the jury never heard about there being a reward, or about the conditions that would need to be met for Ellison to claim it. Johnson\u2019s post-conviction attorneys would later discover that Ellison also told police she\u2019d overheard another conversation several days earlier in which a man identifying himself as Johnson denied knowing anything about the murder. The defense and jury never heard about that either.\n\nEllison\u2019s testimony was the only evidence against Johnson. As with Ford, there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime. The girl who got Johnson arrested, Yolanda Chambers, hadn\u2019t testified against him. He hadn\u2019t been identified by any other eyewitnesses. And the police hadn\u2019t connected him to the bullets fired at Hardy. Nevertheless, as with Ford, the jury in Johnson\u2019s trial was unable to reach a verdict. At the time the mistrial was declared, the jury stood at 10-2 to convict.\n\nThe state moved to try both men again. For the second round, Johnson would be tried first, in August 1998. Once again, Ellison and her daughter would testify.\n\nTunnel vision\n\nFrom the start, the investigation into William Hardy\u2019s murder was a morass of ambiguous and conflicting evidence and statements from witnesses. Even setting aside Yolanda Chambers\u2019s ongoing lies, a simple assessment of the various witnesses\u2019 motivations should have indicated to law enforcement that they were barreling down the wrong path. Chambers started telling stories that didn\u2019t check out only after she told police she knew nothing about the crime, and was threatened with jail. Carla Bowen only implicated Ardragus Ford once she was threatened with the loss of her children. Both of them had strong incentives to provide incriminating information. On the other side, you have the witnesses who saw Ford and Toforest Johnson at the nightclub, none of whom had much to gain for their testimony. And then there\u2019s Ford and Latanya Henderson, both of whom stuck to their stories in spite of threats from law enforcement.\n\nThe investigators appear to have been afflicted with tunnel vision, a form of cognitive bias that is common in wrongful convictions and especially in high-profile cases. Tunnel vision, writes Keith Findley of the University of Wisconsin Law School and the Wisconsin Innocence Project, \u201cleads investigators, prosecutors, judges, and defense lawyers alike to focus on a particular conclusion and then filter all evidence in a case through the lens provided by that conclusion.\u201d Instead of following leads until the evidence points to a perpetrator \u2014 a process that can be time-consuming \u2014 tunnel-visioned investigators start with a suspect, then look for evidence to confirm their suspicions. Exonerating evidence and leads pointing to alternate suspects tend to be ignored.\n\nWith Hardy\u2019s murder, investigators seemed certain that they would find their killer within Chambers\u2019s social circle. So they pressed her for information, over and over, all the while ignoring the mounting evidence that she wasn\u2019t a reliable witness and had no connection to the crime. As time went on and the trail grew colder, it would become increasingly difficult for any law enforcement officials to admit \u2014 to the public or to themselves \u2014 that they had botched the investigation.\n\nAround 12:30 a.m., Hardy must have heard something in the parking lot that got his attention, because he stepped away from his post to investigate so quickly that he left a cigarette burning in an ashtray. Within seconds, a shot rang out.\n\nInstead, they would proceed with bizarrely contradictory theories of the crime based on what little evidence they had. Of all the myriad ways Alabama\u2019s system failed Ford, Johnson and the family of William Hardy, that might be the most jarring. Prosecutors moved seamlessly between inherently contradictory theories. Just a month after telling a jury that Ford shot Hardy, deputy district attorney Jeff Wallace assured a new jury that Johnson pulled the trigger. (When I reached Wallace by phone, he said he would not talk about a pending case.) Just a month after Wallace matter of factly told a jury that the forensic evidence unambiguously demonstrated that Hardy was killed by a man firing up from a wheelchair, the state solicited testimony from the medical examiner that the bullet trajectory was inconclusive about the position of the shooter.\n\nOdder still, just a month before Ford\u2019s trial, Wallace filed a motion to consolidate the charges in the two cases and to try both men at the same time. It\u2019s unclear exactly how that would have gone down. The main reason Wallace got away with his competing theories is that he had two separate juries \u2014 he could vouch for Chambers\u2019s credibility to one jury, while describing her as a liar to another. He couldn\u2019t do both in front of the same jury. But if prosecutors weren\u2019t planning to argue both theories, it means that just a month before the first trial, they had yet some other theory at the ready.\n\nAt a hearing on the motion to consolidate, there was another curious moment, one that again suggests that just as prosecutors were set to go trial, their theory of the crime remained fungible. Attorneys for both Johnson and Ford were at the hearing, and both opposed consolidation. At one point, Johnson\u2019s attorney told the judge that Violet Ellison told him that she heard the voice on the phone say \u201cWe shot him because he got in our s--t,\u201d not \u201cI.\u201d\n\nWallace responded, \u201cMy recollection is that he used the word \u2018I.' But, nonetheless, that can be changed to the word \u2018I.\u2019\u201d Was Wallace suggesting in open court that they alter a witness statement to fit a more convenient theory of the crime? Richard Jaffe certainly seemed to think this is what happened. He responded, \u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable. He\u2019s going to \u2014 \u201d At that point, according to the transcript, the judge cut Jaffe off.\n\nIn the end, Bahakel denied Wallace\u2019s motion. There would be two more trials. And the state would continue to insist on the impossible. First they would argue that William Hardy was killed by Toforest Johson (and possibly Quintez Wilson) but not by Ardragus Ford. Then they would argue he was killed by Ford, but not Johnson. They never posited at any trial that both men killed Hardy, perhaps by each firing a bullet. They couldn\u2019t, because that was one of the few scenarios to which no one, not even Yolanda Chambers, was willing to testify.\n\nConflicting theories\n\nAt Johnson\u2019s second trial, his own attorneys called Yolanda Chambers to testify. It was a risky move. On the one hand, Chambers was the reason their client had been arrested in the first place, yet she had just testified in another case that someone else had committed the crime. But putting an untrustworthy witness on the stand isn\u2019t the best way to win over a jury. Wallace pounced. In his closing argument, he called Chambers a \u201cliar,\u201d and scolded the defense for calling such an untrustworthy witness. \u201cNever once, not one time, did we in our case put before you anything said before Yolanda Chambers,\u201d he said, just months after he\u2019d done exactly that \u2014 albeit in front of a different jury. And a few months later, before yet another jury, he\u2019d do exactly that again.\u201c State didn\u2019t call her, the Defense did. I want you to remember that.\u201d\n\nPutting Chambers on the witness stand also contradicted the strongest evidence exonerating Johnson \u2014 the two witnesses who put him at Tee\u2019s Place. (His appellate attorneys would later find eight more.) Chambers put Johnson at the crime scene but said he didn\u2019t commit the murder. Admitting that he was knowingly present for a drug deal, or possibly an assault, likely hurt him with members of the jury. And presenting contradictory stories likely only confused them.\n\nThis time, the jury convicted. About a half-hour later, they voted 10-2 in favor of execution. Judge Bahakel then sentenced Johnson to die.\n\nArdragus Ford\u2019s second trial was in June 1999. Again, the state\u2019s case rested almost entirely on Chambers, the very person Jeff Wallace had previously told jurors was a liar. The defense cross-examined Chambers meticulously, forcing her to admit to each of her lies, one at a time. It eventually go to be too much for prosecutors, who ended the misery stipulating that Chambers had lied about the crime to law enforcement at least 300 times. Ford was acquitted. His attorneys didn\u2019t even bother putting on a defense.\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing again what had just happened: The state of Alabama attempted to get a death sentence for a man based on a theory of a murder that directly contradicted a different theory of the same murder that the same state \u2014 indeed, the same prosecutor \u2014 had already used to put a different man on death row.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on whether prosecutors can argue conflicting theories of the same crime at separate trials. But while prosecutors aren\u2019t required to investigate the veracity of every piece of evidence they present, they also can\u2019t present evidence they know to be false. When a prosecutor argues directly contradictory theories at separate trials, he certainly knows that he presented false evidence in one of those trials, even if he might not know which one is false.\n\nIn 2005, the court did hear oral arguments in an Ohio case in which the state presented contradictory theories about whether a defendant or his accomplice had fired the fatal shot during an armed robbery that left a woman dead and her husband wounded. But the state\u2019s conflicting theory only came up during sentencing, not during the guilt phase of the defendant\u2019s trial. The court sent the case back to state court without addressing the conflicting-theories issue. (During oral arguments, Justice David Souter suggested hypothetically that conflicting theories could violate due process. Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to scoff at the suggestion.)\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing again what had just happened: The state of Alabama attempted to get a death sentence for a man based on a theory of a murder that directly contradicted a different theory of the same murder that the same state \u2014 indeed, the same prosecutor \u2014 had already used to put a different man on death row.\n\nIn a 2017 article for the Marshall Project, journalist Ken Armstrong found just under 50 cases in which the defense argued in court fillings that the state had argued conflicting theories of a murder. In 29 such cases the defendant was sentenced to die, and in seven the accused has since been executed. In all but a couple cases, the convictions were allowed to stand. In a 1999 article for the Fordham Law Review, Michael Q. English did find that a few courts have allowed defense attorneys to introduce a prosecutor\u2019s conflicting statements about a crime from a previous trial. That would at least inform the jury that the state was advancing contradictory theories. But that approach would be available only to the defendant who was tried second. Whoever went first would be out of luck.\n\nThe main problem is that appellate courts tend to look at cases in isolation. They will rarely even consider facts that aren\u2019t in the trial record, so it\u2019s a tall order to ask that they consider how the state\u2019s actions in one case might affect another. This is exactly the approach the Alabama Criminal Court of Appeals took when Johnson tried to argue that the contradictory theories violated his right to due process. \u201cThere is no evidence in the record before this Court that the prosecutor argued a different theory of the murder at Ford\u2019s trial,\u201d the court wrote in a unanimous opinion denying Johnson\u2019s appeal. \u201cIn fact, the record in Johnson\u2019s case does not even reveal that Ford was ever tried for the murder of Deputy Hardy, much less that the prosecutor tried Ford on the theory that Ford was the triggerman.\u201d Of course, it would have been impossible for Johnson\u2019s counsel to have mentioned anything the prosecution said in Ford\u2019s second trial, because when Johnson was convicted, Ford\u2019s second trial hadn\u2019t yet happened.\n\nAt the very least, seeking the death penalty for two men by claiming the evidence supports exclusive theories of the crime would seem to violate a prosecutor\u2019s professional ethics. \u201cWhile the practice may be considered constitutional, it is extremely difficult to square with the understanding that a prosecutor\u2019s primary obligation is to do justice, not merely win cases,\u201d says Carissa Hessick, director of the Prosecutors and Politics Project at the University of North Carolina School of Law. \u201cAny prosecutor who pursues this path should face significant scrutiny and should have to publicly explain and defend the decision.\u201d\n\nA deficient defense\n\nArdragus Ford\u2019s family was able to find the money to hire Richard Jaffe, an attorney with extensive experience trying death penalty cases. Toforest Johnson was assigned a court-appointed attorney. There\u2019s no evidence that the attorney didn\u2019t give the case his full attention, but there\u2019s also no question that he made mistakes. He called Yolanda Chambers to the stand. Some of his witnesses were unprepared or underprepared. He also proposed conflicting stories to the jury.\n\nJohnson\u2019s attorney also admitted in a court filing that he lacked the necessary experience for a capital case. \u201cDefendant\u2019s attorney does not have the expertise in criminal investigation work to investigate the facts and interview the witnesses surrounding the alleged crime with which the Defendant is charged,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Defendant\u2019s attorney has no formal training in criminal investigation, nor do they have the capabilities and time to interview all the potential witnesses and conduct all the investigation necessary and essential to provide the Defendant with an adequate defense.\u201d\n\nThat admission came in a request for the court to provide funding to hire a private investigator. The trial court agreed but was stingy with the funds. With what they were given, Johnson\u2019s legal team could only afford to hire an investigator named Steve Saxon. Johnson\u2019s current lawyers describe him as \u201ca brain-damaged, alcoholic, racist, suicidal, homeless man ... who had already been fired from at least one capital case for incompetence, had been operating without a business license for at least five years, and who could barely manage his own day-to-day affairs.\u201d (Saxon has since died.)\n\nDuring the time he had been hired to investigate Johnson\u2019s case, Saxon admitted to drinking a quarter gallon of whiskey per day. Johnson had given Saxon a list of witnesses who would testify on his behalf; Saxon never spoke with any of them. (Saxon at one point admitted that he refused to interview witnesses in \u201cdangerous\u201d neighborhoods.) Saxon also didn\u2019t manage to find the 10 witnesses who have since said they saw Johnson at Tee\u2019s Place on the night of the killing. He failed to turn up the mitigating factors around Violet Ellison\u2019s testimony, or an eyewitness who said he saw a 6-foot man hovering over Hardy\u2019s body immediately after the shooting. (Johnson is 5-foot-5.)\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s conviction, he was still destitute and needed an attorney to file his appeal. Despite that his was a death penalty case, and that there was ample reason to question his conviction, the court assigned a man named Joe Morgan Jr. to the case. Shortly after he filed and argued Johnson\u2019s appeal, the Alabama Supreme Court suspended Morgan\u2019s law license for two years. He had just pleaded guilty to ethics violations in nine separate cases for neglecting his clients. One state Supreme Court justice argued that the suspension was too light, writing that Morgan \u201cexhibited an attitude of indifference and disrespect to his clients and to his profession,\u201d and that \u201cMorgan\u2019s actions and inactions justify requiring a lengthier rehabilitation before he resumes the practice of law.\u201d\n\n\n\nToforest Johnson, center, with his sons Maurice Myers, left, and Tremaine Perry. (Family photo)\n\n\u201cMy client\u2019s [Ardragus Ford] family had some limited financial resources,\u201d Jaffe says. \u201cToforest Johnson\u2019s family did not. His lawyers were appointed, and his family could not bond him out of jail. You can see how all of that affected his defense. His investigator had serious problems, including alcoholism, that clearly hampered his investigation. Of all the people arrested for Hardy\u2019s murder, he was the only one convicted. To this day, I still do not understand why his attorneys called Yolanda Chambers to testify.\u201d\n\nToday, Johnson is represented by the Southern Center for Human Rights and the Death Penalty Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, two reputable groups with experienced, well-trained death penalty attorneys. He is currently awaiting the judge\u2019s ruling on the issue of Ellison and the $5,000 check. If he loses his motion, he will have exhausted his state appeals and will begin the process of asking a federal court to review his case \u2014 a process that is heavily deferential to the state courts.\n\nThe evidence against Johnson is flimsy, particularly for a death penalty case. The fact that he\u2019s still on death row demonstrates the folly of the notion that appellate courts are adequately ensuring the fairness of criminal trials. Johnson\u2019s case has been heavily litigated at every level of Alabama\u2019s criminal court system, and yet so far the multitude of problems with how his case was investigated, charged and tried hasn\u2019t been enough to win him a new trial. At this point even Jeff Wallace \u2014 the man who prosecuted Johnson \u2014 has told Johnson\u2019s attorneys under oath that he has doubts about their client\u2019s guilt. When reached by phone, Wallace said he wouldn\u2019t comment on a pending case. But he did offer his assessment of Johnson\u2019s conviction in a 2014 deposition. \u201cI don\u2019t think the State\u2019s case was very strong,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it depended on the testimony of Violet Ellison, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Birmingham elected its first black district attorney. Danny Carr, who began his career as a prosecutor in 2000, ran on a platform of reform. Carr doesn\u2019t have the authority to drop the charges against Johnson or to retry him \u2014 the case is now in the hands of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall. But if he were to speak out on the case, it could influence how Marshall\u2019s office proceeds.\n\nOne of the most striking things about this story is the mundanity of the violence in the lives of people like Johnson and Ford. At age 17, Johnson himself took a bullet to the chest during a drive-by shooting. Ford was paralyzed from the waist down after taking a bullet while protecting his cousin from a shooter. (Even Carr has been touched by violence \u2014 his brother was murdered in 2001.)\n\nAfter his 15-month incarceration, Quintez Wilson accumulated a lengthy record of drug crimes and assaults before he himself was gunned down in 2008. Latanya Henderson told the truth from the start, and for that she was arrested and spent nearly a year in juvenile detention. Chambers told the truth in her first interview, but was browbeaten and threatened into implicating innocent people. She died of unknown causes in 1999, at just 20 years old. Johnson, of course, still sits on Alabama\u2019s death row.\n\nThere\u2019s one other group of people victimized by the state\u2019s ineptitude in this case: William Hardy\u2019s family. If Johnson is innocent \u2014 and nearly everyone originally associated with his case now believes he is \u2014 then Hardy\u2019s killer was never caught, and whatever solace Hardy\u2019s family might have been given by Johnson\u2019s conviction will need to be unsettled. Whatever pain the family has managed to bury might be resurrected.\n\nThe perverse thing is that the longer a case like this drags out, the more tempting it becomes for state officials to follow the path laid out by Alabama\u2019s courts: Ignore the evidence, execute Johnson and pretend he was treated fairly. Pretend that the lives wrecked by the investigation weren\u2019t for naught, and that the man who actually killed Hardy didn\u2019t slip the grip of the law.\n\nThat isn\u2019t justice; it\u2019s an illusion. Unfortunately, buying into the illusion is a lot easier than reckoning with reality. And the reality here is that any system that could allow Johnson to be convicted, sentenced to die and remain on death row for this long, on this dearth of evidence, is a system broken to its core.\n\nRead more:\n\nRadley Balko: He had a long record of misconduct.
