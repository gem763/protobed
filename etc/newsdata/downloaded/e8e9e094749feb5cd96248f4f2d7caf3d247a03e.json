Baekdu", "language": "en", "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has scaled Mt. Baekdu on a white horse, state media reported Wednesday.\n\nKim often visits the mountain, the mythical birthplace of nation founder Kim Il-sung, before making momentous decisions, for example in December 2013, just before executing his uncle Jang Song-taek, and in late 2017 just before the North announced the completion of its nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe latest, somewhat \"Game of Thrones\" photo op took place after working-level talks with the U.S. collapsed while the North threatened to resume nuclear and missile tests.\n\nThis is the first time Kim has climbed it on a white horse, though they are often used as propaganda tools because of a myth that Kim Il-sung traversed the battlefield on such a steed during the guerilla wars against the Japanese occupiers.\n\nKim In-tae at the Institute for National Security Strategy said the stunt seems intended to justify the hereditary transfer of power and stir up patriotism among North Koreans amid international sanctions.\"\n\n", "description": "Kim Jong-un Rides a White Horse up Mt.
