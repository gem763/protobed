In smaller lettering the newspaper mockingly asked, \"Pelosi announces 'inquiry' - but isn't that what they've already been doing?\" Various Trump activities are the subject of about a dozen ongoing congressional investigations as well as more than a dozen federal, state and local inquiries.\n\nAs controversy swirled over the whistleblower complaint, pro-Trump commentators also used humor to skewer former vice president Biden. Conservative commentator Glenn Beck on Monday said, \"The first stop on Biden's corruption tour is Ukraine.\"\n\nNBC's Seth Meyers, host of \"Late Night,\" also ribbed Pelosi on Tuesday.\n\n\"I've had my doubts in the past but I think this time, she's serious,\" Meyers said as over his shoulder appeared a photograph of Pelosi with her face painted blue to threaten war, resembling actor Mel Gibson as a 13th century Scottish warrior in the 1995 film Braveheart.\n\nKimmel referenced both Pelosi's long-time reluctance to initiate an impeachment inquiry and accusations against Trump by more than a dozen women who said he made unwanted sexual advances against them before he entered politics. Trump has denied the accusations.\n\n\"Once again, Donald Trump is doing what he does best \u2014 forcing a woman to do something she didn't want to do,\" Kimmel said in his monologue.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Barbara Goldberg, additional reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Alistair Bell)", "description": "From late night television hosts to tabloid front pages, the congressional Democrats' impeachment inquiry of U.S. President Trump sparked a firestorm of jokes and quips.
