He teaches at McGill University in Montreal and is a distinguished scholar at many international universities and seminars. This book is a collection of stories and insights, all in digestible size, and all wise and challenging.\n\nHe scans a wide range of topics from which I have chosen only a handful.\n\nManagers who really manage are essential to most companies, but choosing the right one is not easy. We know that everyone\u2019s flaws come out sooner or later, so sooner must be better. Managers should be selected for their flaws as much as for their qualities, but we mistakenly focus on the qualities.\n\nThere are only two ways to know a person\u2019s flaws: marry them or work for them. One prescription that could improve the practice of managing monumentally, is to hear from people who have been managed by the candidates.\n\nMintzberg has done a lot of research into strategy and five of his books focus on that topic. Here he presents his view in a few pages.\n\nWhen in need of a strategy, most companies, organisations and SOEs opt for the \u2018The Hothouse Model of Strategy Formulation\u2019. The strategy team (in- or outsourced,) analyses the appropriate data so that the CEO can arrive at the strategy \"through a controlled process of conscious thought, much as tomatoes are cultivated in a hothouse.\"\n\nThe strategy is immaculately conceived, and made explicit, much as ripe tomatoes are picked and sent to market. Then the strategy is implemented, the necessary budgets are set aside, and the organisational structure designed to provide the perfect context, the hothouse, for the strategy.\n\nIf after all this the strategy fails, then the fault must lie with people who were not smart enough to implement the CEO\u2019s brilliant strategy. If they were, the carefully nurtured strategy would have flourished on schedule, and the market would rush over to buy the produce.\n\nUnfortunately, business doesn\u2019t work this way. Effective strategies will grow initially like weeds in a garden; not controlled like tomatoes in a hothouse. The process of working and learning, itself will have strategies emerge if the people are given the opportunity to come up with ideas that can evolve into a strategy.\n\n\"Productive strategists build gardens in fertile ground, where all kinds of ideas can take root and the best of them can grow.\"\n\nIndividual ideas become strategies when they circulate in the organisation. One team sees the other doing something interesting, and sales sees the opportunity, and soon the whole organisation has a new strategy.\n\nWeeds can spread and cover a whole garden. A weed is only a plant that wasn\u2019t expected. Just consider that Europeans put the leaves of dandelions in their salad. Dandelions are America\u2019s most notorious weed.\n\nThis strategy approach doesn\u2019t plan, but rather recognises strategy\u2019s emergence and intervenes only when appropriate - a truly destructive weed must be uprooted immediately.\n\nYou can do a lot of strategy by forgetting the word and doing a lot more learning than planning.\n\nMintzberg introduces the term \"communityship\" that he believes should be more prominent in business than leadership. Effective organisations are communities of human beings and you can recognise this from the feel of the place, its energy, the commitment of its people, and their collective interest in what they do. They are much more than \u2018empowered\u2019, they are naturally engaged. They respect the organisation because it respects them.\n\nThis is not to say we don\u2019t need leadership; we do \u2013 to enable and establish communityship in new organisations and sustain it in established ones.\n\nNetworks are not communities. Networks connect, but communities care. Not sure? Ask your network of Facebook friends to help paint your house\u2026\n\nEvery organisation is different, but there are species of organisations just as there are species of mammals. Managing one well does not mean you even understand, let alone can manage another. Mintzberg addressed this problem in his book The Structuring of Organisations.\n\nFour types emerge.\n\nThe \u2018programmed machine\u2019 organisation, is all about efficiency. Knowing how many seconds are required before a McDonald\u2019s cook has to turn over a hamburger patty, makes training and consistency easier, even if it makes worker engagement harder.\n\nThe \u2018professional assemblage\u2019 is more about proficiency than efficiency. Entrance to these organisations requires years of training. These professionals who seem to be working in teams are usually working largely on their own. Their training has taught them exactly what to expect from one another. One of Mintzberg\u2019s students observed a five-hour open heart operation during which the surgeon and the anaesthetist never talked to each other.\n\nIn the \u2018personal enterprise\u2019 one person dominates and is its directing centre. Steve Jobs at Apple or Muhammad Yunus, at the Grameen Bank are examples. When told to jump the response is \"How high, sir?\" Issue the same instruction in a hospital and the doctor asks, \"Why?\"\n\nThe \u2018project pioneer\u2019 organisation has experts who must work effectively in teams to produce through their combined efforts. Think film companies, advertising agencies, and research laboratories. Their effectiveness is achieved by being inefficient. Without some slack, innovation dies.\n\nGiven the vast differences in organisations, the measuring of managing is a \"tricky task\". There are lots of easy ways to assess managers, but \"beware of them all!\" Mintzberg cautions.\n\nThe effectiveness of a manager can only be seen in context. The reality is that managers are not effective; matches are effective. He uses a very useful analogy to make this point: \"There are not so much good husbands and good wives as good couples, likewise with good managers and their units.\"\n\nFlaws you can accept in one company can be fatal in another. Skill at cutting costs in one company can bankrupt another. There are managers who fail in all managerial jobs, but there are none who can succeed in all of them.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of a manager, you must factor in the effectiveness of the unit being managed, and the contribution of the manager to that effectiveness. Some units function well despite poor management, and others would be a lot worse if not for a strong manager.\n\nManagers cannot be held automatically responsible for any success or failure of their unit: history matters; culture matters; markets matter; even weather matters.\n\nThis easy to read book is replete with profound insights that you will recognise as true, as well as many you will need to think through. If you are already thinking of year-end gifts for managers, keep this one on your list.\n\nReadability Light -+--- Serious\n\nInsights High +---- Low\n\nPractical High --+-- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on strategy and implementation and is the author of \u2018Strategy that Works\u2019 and \u2018The Executive Update.\u2019 Views expressed are his own.", "description": "If there's a manager on your gift list, get them this book, says Ian Mann.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9472/e7c02bf261c8449d9500530591384521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
