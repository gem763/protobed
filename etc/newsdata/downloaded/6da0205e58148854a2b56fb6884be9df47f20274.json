Today, that list has grown. And according to Gregan, Japanese fans believe the Brave Blossoms should be on the list of potential champions.\n\n\"The game is getting closer and closer,\" added Gregan.\n\nJapanese players celebrate during their game against Ireland in Shizuoka on September 28.\n\nMost competitive World Cup\n\nThe reduction in the gap between tier one nations -- those competing in the elite competitions of Europe's Six Nations and the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship -- and the tier two nations has made this year's showpiece the most competitive yet.\n\n\"The first team to go back to back was New Zealand , no one else has done it,\" Gregan said. \"It shows how hard it is to do it. To get in a final and then win it. It's not easy.\"\n\nGeorge Gregan played 139 Tests for Australia.\n\nOne of the favorites to go all the way this time is England . The men in white had a disastrous outing on their own patch four years ago where they were unceremoniously knocked out at the group stage. But under the tutelage of Eddie Jones , the 2003 champion has transformed into a formidable unit.\n\n\"Eddie is the best coach I've ever had,\" said Gregan of his countryman, who was the Japan coach four years ago, and was also an assistant coach in South Africa's victorious 2007 set up after taking Australia to the 2003 final.\n\n\"He sometimes breaks you down to build you up. He is so supportive of his playing group. He can coach everywhere. He's coached in Japan, he's coached South Africans, he's coached Aussies. If you spoke to the majority of people who were coached by Eddie, he made them better players.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Rugby superfans cycle from London to Tokyo Replay More Videos ...

It's so organized and the local people are so welcoming.\"\n\nJapan next take on Samoa Saturday before a crucial clash against Scotland on October 13. Win both, and Japan would defy the odds and top its group.
