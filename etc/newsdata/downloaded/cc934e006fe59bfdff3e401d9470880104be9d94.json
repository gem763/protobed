T 0.34% promoted longtime executive John Stankey to a newly created No. 2 role, setting up the WarnerMedia boss as the likely successor to Chief Executive Randall Stephenson.\n\nMr. Stankey, 56 years old, will serve as president and chief operating officer starting next month. He will continue to serve as the head of WarnerMedia, the unit that houses HBO, the Warner Bros. studio and cable channels like CNN.\n\nHe will report to Mr. Stephenson and is the front-runner to take over the top job, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Stankey joined one of AT&T\u2019s predecessors in 1985 and spent most of his career in the telecommunications business.\n\nMr. Stephenson, 59 years old, hasn\u2019t indicated when he plans to retire, though he has been CEO for 12 years and there are discussions for and against his retirement at the board level, the people said. Mr. Stephenson has reshaped AT&T during his tenure, piling on tens of billions of dollars in debt to turn the Dallas company into one of the world\u2019s biggest media producers.\n\nThe promotion comes after Mr. Stankey\u2019s main rival for the No. 2 job, AT&T Communications chief John Donovan, said last week that he would retire on Oct. 1. The 58-year-old executive decided to step down when it became clear he wasn\u2019t in line to become chief operating officer under the new regime, some of the people said.\n\nThe company on Tuesday promoted Jeff McElfresh, 48, the telecom division\u2019s head of technology and operations, to succeed Mr. Donovan. He will oversee the company\u2019s core wireless and telephone businesses, as well as DirecTV, its satellite-TV service. Mr. McElfresh will report to Mr. Stankey, as will the WarnerMedia unit and Brian Lesser, CEO of Xandr, the company\u2019s digital advertising business.\n\nMr. Stankey became a media executive after AT&T acquired Time Warner, the result of a protracted antitrust battle started by Justice Department authorities who said the merger would hurt competition. He has replaced most of the Time Warner leadership team and brought in new deputies including former NBCUniversal executive Robert Greenblatt.\n\nMr. Stankey will take on more responsibilities during a pivotal time for WarnerMedia, which plans to launch an early version of a new streaming brand called HBO Max in October. The online video service will carry films and TV shows and will eventually have live events like sports.\n\nAT&T moved beyond its telephone roots in 2015 when it bought DirecTV, turning the company into the nation\u2019s biggest pay-TV provider. The company doubled down on the media business in 2018 when it spent more than $80 billion to acquire Time Warner.\n\nThat business, renamed WarnerMedia, has featured the kind of boom-and-bust performance familiar to most media companies. DirecTV has lost millions of customers as high prices and streaming options like Netflix Inc. convince subscribers to cut the pay-TV cord.\n\nAs it explored CEO succession, AT&T discussed combining the DirecTV and WarnerMedia businesses, said one person familiar with the matter. It isn\u2019t known whether that will happen now that Mr. Stankey has been promoted, another person said. The wireless and telecom businesses still account for most of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nIn a securities filing Tuesday, AT&T said it hasn\u2019t yet determined what Mr. Stankey\u2019s compensation will be in the new COO role. In 2018, he received $16.6 million in compensation, including stock awards, a base salary of $2 million and a $2 million bonus for the closing of the Time Warner merger.\n\n\u2014Shalini Ramachandran contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com", "description": "AT&T promoted longtime executive John Stankey to a newly created No. 2 role, setting up the WarnerMedia boss as the likely successor to CEO Randall Stephenson.", "authors": ["Drew Fitzgerald", "Andrew.Fitzgerald Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103496/social"}
