I really wanted that to be true.\n\n\u2018I would be looking for her and I would think I saw her some place; catch the back of someone\u2019s head that looked a bit like Anna.\n\nThe family of Anna Campbell, 26, (pictured) revealed the pain of being unable to lay her body to rest, 19 months after she was killed in Syria\n\n\u2018I understand what it must be like for a family when they have a missing person, because they can never give up hope that they might be found.\u2019\n\nBut there is, sadly, no doubt at all that Anna is dead. Hester and her father, Dirk, are speaking out now because the family has just launched a legal battle to bring Anna\u2019s remains back home, and hope to \u2018crowdfund\u2019 enough money to pay for it.\n\nIt\u2019s a position they could never have imagined themselves in. Indeed, the story of Anna\u2019s life is almost worthy of a Hollywood film script \u2014 a privately educated Sussex schoolgirl, raised in comfort, surrounded by love and encouraged to stand up for her convictions, she became consumed by a desire to help Kurds in Syria fight for a land of their own against Isis.\n\nIt was a quest that saw her make a secret 2,500-mile journey to fight, wielding AK-47s in a dusty battlefield, only to die in a terrible manner her family still struggle to comprehend. The fracture her death has left is still very much apparent as Hester plays with her infant son Marlowe, the nephew Anna never met.\n\n\u2018If you had been a girl you would definitely have been called Anna,\u2019 Hester, now 39, tells the gurgling four-month-old.\n\nIn fact, it was only when Hester became pregnant, eight months after Anna\u2019s death, that she was able to stop crying near constantly. Her almost unbearable feeling of loss, she says, was briefly elevated by a surge of happy hormones in the weeks following conception.\n\n\u2018It brings you into the present, having a tiny baby,\u2019 she says, adding: \u2018It is devastating for me that he won\u2019t know his auntie.\u2019\n\nShe pauses, gazing down at Marlowe, her third child after daughter Wren, nine, and son Drake, three.\n\nWhile theirs is undoubtedly a privileged family \u2014 Dirk is a folk musician and renowned composer, whose work has appeared in films including Aladdin and Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire \u2014 it is notable how close-knit the Campbells are; how idyllic the girls\u2019 childhood sounds.\n\nHester recounts how, on Anna\u2019s 13th birthday, the sisters played in the woods behind their home and sang about Anna not wanting to be a teenager.\n\nHester recalls Anna (pictured second from left with her dad Dirk and late mum Adrienne, and three of her siblings, Sophia, Rose and Adam) wanting the world to be better than it is\n\n\u2018She wanted to be a little kid for ever,\u2019 she says, telling me Anna was the bravest and most bookish of the siblings \u2014 six sisters and one brother \u2014 and loved playing outdoors. Photos show a happy, fair-haired little girl, surrounded by her siblings and playing in the garden or local woodlands.\n\nHester pulls out a tatty volume, The Yellow Fairy Book, from her father\u2019s bookshelf.\n\nHester says: \u2018Dad\u2019s got this collection of amazing fairy tales. I remember him reading them to me, but Anna read every single one herself.\n\n\u2018Anna was a romantic because she thought the world should be better than it is. She thought people should be better than they are.\u2019\n\nThe family have one prized memento of Anna\u2019s time in Syria: a diary she kept while there that Dirk, 68, managed to recover during a trip he made to the war-torn nation earlier this year as part of a BBC documentary.\n\nHe takes it out carefully from an old, emerald-green briefcase where he keeps reminders of his daughter, and reads out the part that has stayed with him the most \u2014 where Anna contemplates death.\n\n\u2018I thought about how it would be to not mind to die, and how it was when I was convinced that I wouldn\u2019t make it back from this trip,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018I would never again see the sunlight shining through the new beech leaves in the forests of my childhood.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s a silence as we absorb her words, broken only by baby Marlowe cooing on the sofa.\n\nFor those who knew Anna, her journey to a foreign battlefield seems, now, almost to have been fated.\n\nGrowing up in a matriarchal household, she was surrounded by outspoken women \u2014 her mother, Adrienne, most of all.\n\nI think what we have to realise is Anna lived very fully and very actively. She packed into her 26 years more than most people pack into 80 years - Dirk\n\nDirk recounts an exchange captured on home video between Adrienne and Anna when she was aged just six. Blonde and cherubic, Anna is sitting on the carpet with her sister, Rose, then four, playing with Barbie dolls and Sylvanian Family toy figures. Some of the toys are holding flags.\n\n\u2018Her mum was videoing her and they were playing with Sylvanian Families. Anna said, \u201cThe Sylvanians are going to have a war with the Barbies. They are always fighting the Barbies.\u201d Adrienne said, \u201cAnd do the women and children fight as well?\u201d And Anna replied, \u201cUnfortunately they do,\u201d\u2019 Dirk says. Hester, who has also watched the video enough times to know it verbatim, corrects her father: \u2018Sadly they do.\u2019\n\nAnna, it seems, always fought for the underdog in real life as well as in play. Aged 11, she saw some children tormenting a bee on the school playground.\n\n\u2018She went to defend this bumblebee. They laughed at her, but it was kind of emblematic of who she was,\u2019 he says. \u2018She just did not care what other people thought, her main motive in life was to protect the weak, innocent and vulnerable.\n\n\u2018She was brave. She got that from her mother I think,\u2019 Dirk says sadly.\n\nAdrienne, a beekeeper, was also an activist and was by Anna\u2019s side at a demonstration in London nine years ago when women stormed the Houses of Parliament. Their intense bond was forged through such protest action.\n\nDirk, 68, (pictured with Hester) who recovered Anna's diary during a trip to Syria earlier this year, believes she got her bravery from her mother\n\nThen, in 2012, when Anna was 21, her mother died of breast cancer after a four-year battle against the disease. After Adrienne\u2019s death, her ashes were scattered in the local churchyard and a hand-carved wooden bench placed in her memory.\n\nHester recalls now that there \u2018was something very right about carrying her in her coffin and laying her to rest. Not being able to do that for Anna just feels really, really wrong. You\u2019re supposed to have a chance to be there at the end, and wish them on their way.\u2019\n\nAfter that first loss, Dirk moved from the six-bedroom family home in Lewes to his smaller flat, down the road.\n\nThe walls are decorated with his musical instruments and there\u2019s a chalkboard by the piano with a reminder of dates when his youngest child, Adam, is next home.\n\nEvery wall, every surface, shows pictures of happier times, including one of his girls together on a trip to Leeds and his wife holding their firstborn, Sophia.\n\nAnna had three full siblings, Sophia, Rose and Adam, and three half-sisters, Hester, Rayne and Sara.\n\n\u2018It used to be a household of six, and it\u2019s now down to four. It\u2019s just too heartbreaking,\u2019 says Hester, who lives a short train ride away in Deptford with her family.\n\nTheir whole world changed in mid-2017 when Anna, who after her mother\u2019s death had increasingly taken up causes as diverse as fighting the badger cull and supporting female refugees in Calais, decided to travel to Syria to join Kurdish forces fighting against Islamic State terrorists.\n\nAfraid they would dissuade her, she only told a handful of family members, including her father.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t surprised when she announced she was going to Rojava (the Kurdish name for the autonomous region of northern Syria). I was seriously alarmed, but it was in character,\u2019 says Dirk.\n\nIt is painful to everyone who knew Anna \u2014 the fact that what she gave her life for is going to be ancient history - Hester\n\nHester only discovered her sister had left for Syria after Anna\u2019s arrival in the war-ravaged region, something that clearly still causes her much emotional turmoil.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m cross with her that she didn\u2019t [tell me], because I wouldn\u2019t have given up trying to change her mind,\u2019 she says, tears streaming down her face.\n\nDuring Anna\u2019s ten months in the region she learned to speak Kurdish fluently and went through weapons training, firing an AK-47 for the first time.\n\nShe was surrounded by foreign women who had come from across the world to join the cause, including those from Norway, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic.\n\nShe called her father on WhatsApp once every couple of months when she had wifi.\n\n\u2018I would ask her what she was doing and if she was in any danger and she would always tell me, \u201cNo, I am nowhere near the fighting.\u201d\n\n\u2018She lulled me into this false sense of security,\u2019 Dirk says. They never spoke about whether she was happy or had made the right decision.\n\nIn March last year, the family\u2019s worst fears became reality when the city of Afrin, near the Turkish border, came under attack \u2014 not from Isis, but from invading Turkish forces. Anna, it seems, was desperate to join the fight.\n\nHer desire to experience combat on the front line was to prove fatal. She was killed by a precision missile in a Turkish airstrike while fighting with an all-female brigade of the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units. Anna became the eighth British citizen to die in the Syrian conflict, and the first British woman.\n\nIn one of the last photographs taken of Anna, who was given the nom de guerre Helin Qerecox, she is dressed head-to-toe in military fatigues with her hair dyed jet black, a far cry from the blonde schoolgirl she once was.\n\nA few days after Anna\u2019s death, the Kurdish lines collapsed and the Turkish-backed forces surged forward. The Kurds had lost Afrin and Anna\u2019s body was left, abandoned, in captured territory.\n\nNow, 18 months on, the family has been forced to launch a campaign to bring her home, and is raising money for legal fees after desperate pleas to the British and Turkish governments went unanswered. They have never been able even to visit the place where she died.\n\nDirk says it is a \u2018constant source of pain\u2019 that he has not been able to bury his daughter, adding: \u2018We have been unable to complete our grieving process. We haven\u2019t been able to have a funeral because we don\u2019t have a body to put in the ground. They\u2019ve ignored my human right to retrieve my daughter\u2019s remains.\u2019\n\nAs Hester describes in tears how she believes Anna must have died in agony, calling out to loved ones who weren\u2019t there, her father tries to convince Hester that her sister would have died quickly; that she felt no pain.\n\nBut to have lost Anna, then not to be able to give her the dignity of a funeral, is a wound the family say they can never recover from.\n\nTo add still further to their torment, Anna\u2019s dream of Kurdish autonomy was crushed earlier this month when U.S. troops pulled out of the border of northern Syria, abandoning their Kurdish allies and paving the way for a Turkish invasion.\n\nHundreds of civilians were killed as Turkish forces seized towns and villages, prompting Russian-backed Syrian regime troops to move in from the south.\n\n\u2018It is painful to everyone who knew Anna \u2014 the fact that what she gave her life for is going to be ancient history. Will anyone know what was achieved in Rojava? It is all very sad,\u2019 Hester says.\n\nDirk says: \u2018I think what we have to realise is Anna lived very fully and very actively. She packed into her 26 years more than most people pack into 80 years.\u2019\n\nBefore Marlowe was born, Hester says her nine-year-old daughter, Wren, asked her: \u2018Are you still sad about Auntie Anna?\u2019\n\nHester replied: \u2018How long do you think I should be sad for?\u2019 To which Wren responded: \u2018Maybe until you are 42, and then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be sad any more.\u2019\n\n\u2018I said I\u2019m always going to be sad, because I wanted Anna to grow up to be an old lady. I won\u2019t ever be at peace with that.\u2019\n\nYou can donate to the family\u2019s campaign at www.crowdjustice.com/case/bring-anna-home", "description": "Anna Campbell, 26, from Sussex, died in a missile strike in Northern Syria last year.
