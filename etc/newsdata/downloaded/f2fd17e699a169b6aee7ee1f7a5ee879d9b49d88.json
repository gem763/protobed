It also said that it had over paid for acquisitions like Containerchain and Prolink.\n\nAfter acquisitions are completed, JCap says the business fails to invest in the companies and takes years to integrate them with the WiseTech platform.\n\n\"Our interviews suggest that, contrary to WiseTech's public narrative, it is harming the companies it acquires by under-investing and jacking up prices on legacy platforms to force clients to move to ... CargoWise One,\" the report reads.\n\n\"WiseTech's acquisition spree looks like a frantic effort to maintain the narrative that this is a fast-growing technology business.\"\n\nBased on JCap interviews with 14 executives of acquired businesses, the integration process is supposedly slow or non-existent and WiseTech's management structure creates bottlenecks that are hard to crack.\n\nIts survey of 13 customers listed on the WiseTech website also found 25 per cent were looking at leave.\n\nBut this sample was a fraction of WiseTech's total customer count of 12,000 businesses and even its biggest customers don't make up more than 5 per cent of revenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report estimated that WiseTech is the second largest player in the market to Descartes, with both having around 25 per cent market share.\n\nThe first JCap report alleged WiseTech had utilised an audit loophole to inflate its revenue, disguise the amount of organic versus acquired revenue and orchestrate a \"stock promote\", but the company and two analysts have since spoken out accusing the firm of miscalculations.\n\nIn its statement to the ASX on Friday, WiseTech denied it had inflated revenues and rejected entirely the allegations of financial impropriety.\n\n\"We would ask the relevant regulators and government, not just for ourselves but for the many listed Australian corporations regularly subjected to similar attacks, to consider the complex issues raised and damage caused by reports of this type issued by a US or overseas short seller,\" the company statement said.", "description": "Hedge fund adviser J Capital has accused the $10 billion tech darling WiseTech of making poor acquisitions to maintain a facade of high growth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8745%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_975%2C$y_212/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/52e2ef197ab19b2ee04b405c35a52438bb34d95b", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
