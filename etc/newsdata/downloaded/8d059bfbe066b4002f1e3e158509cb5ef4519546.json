And the more closely that the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry focuses on Trump\u2019s own corruption and abuses of presidential power \u2013 as seen in his July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u2013 the more Trump will concentrate his ire against Joe Biden, whom he seems to see as his most formidable rival in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump is a predator in every sense of the word. When threatened, he will pounce on any perception of weakness. He will smell any ounce of anxiety or distress over how to respond to his lies, his attempts at character assassination, his dishonest attacks on Biden\u2019s family, and he will go for the jugular.\n\nIn Hollywood terms, Trump is a political \u201cTerminator,\u201d and Biden and his team need to understand that the \u201cterminator is out there. It can\u2019t be bargained with. It can\u2019t be reasoned with. It doesn\u2019t feel pity. Or remorse. Or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.\u201d (Politically speaking in this case.)\n\nThis will become even more stark as polls supporting impeachment become less favorable to Trump. The latest Washington Post poll has 58 percent of voters approving of an impeachment inquiry, with more Republicans than ever in favor. As such, the former vice president needs to respond more aggressively and decisively than perhaps he was prepared to do. He must take the fight to Trump without waffling, without hesitation, without fear.\n\nBiden needs to understand three things.\n\nFirst, fairly or unfairly, he will be under scrutiny for allowing his son to serve on a high-paying foreign company\u2019s corporate board while he served as vice president. He needs to address this head-on, without showing that he is aggravated that this is being asked of him. He should say that there was nothing untoward about his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine \u2013 if that is the case, as I assume it is \u2013 but also acknowledge that, in retrospect, it could create the perception of a conflict of interest and that he will ensure it does not happen again in his administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSecond, he needs to make a true contrast between himself and Donald Trump. He needs to think about the reason he got in this race in the first place, which was laid out in his announcement video. It is about getting things done for the American people but also about the character and the ability of a president to fight for what\u2019s right. Biden needs to hammer home, again and again, that Trump is unfit, unqualified and unable to fight for anything moral, ethical or just.\n\nThird, Biden needs to understand that he will get smacked with false equivalencies because of Hunter Biden\u2019s directorship with Burisma Holdings. Biden needs to slap that down forcefully and unequivocally, without growing defensive. He needs to repeat that there are no facts showing that Hunter\u2019s actions were anything but above board \u2014 and then do a hard pivot to Trump\u2019s own corruption, nepotism, abuse of power and law-breaking actions based on his position as president of the United States.\n\nBiden is getting there. His campaign released a 30-second ad in the early primary states that calls Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d and explains why Trump is obsessed with Biden; it allows Biden to underscore that he is the candidate Trump fears most, which shows that he is getting under Trump\u2019s skin. The underlying message is that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump.\n\nThe former vice president wrote a scathing op-ed in the Washington Post over the weekend that spoke out forcefully against Trump\u2019s attacks on his family. Biden also gave a fiery speech in Reno last week, confronting Trump and telling the president that Biden was not \u201cgoing anywhere.\u201d It got minimal coverage because of all the impeachment news that rolled out the next day, but it was necessarily forceful.\n\nThese are all great starts. But many are concerned that the Biden campaign waffled a bit too long before it responded. That\u2019s fine, but only if it indicates that they will continue to respond, counterattack, leave nothing unanswered and, when possible, do \u201cpre-buttals\u201d when they sense that a Trump attack is coming.\n\nPolls still show Biden with a comfortable lead in key states like Wisconsin and South Carolina. That doesn\u2019t mean he will prevail; Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenClinton jokes she could 'obviously' beat Trump in 2020 'rematch' Budowsky: Biden and Warren at POTUS Rubicon Small-dollar donors reshape Democratic race MORE (D-Mass.) is out-fundraising him and rising steadily in the polls, and she looks good in terms of competitiveness in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nBut if the Biden campaign plays it smart, the fight with Trump can work to its advantage, if it responds quickly and effectively to Trump\u2019s attacks. It has to keep running the ads, keep putting out surrogates to bat down false conspiracy theories and confront Trump\u2019s hypocrisy.\n\nUnlike Hollywood\u2019s \u201cTerminator,\u201d Trump does feel fear \u2014 that\u2019s why he\u2019s become so unhinged. But the rest of the movie\u2019s line does apply: He will not stop. He will not let up. He will never give in, until he feels Biden is politically dead.\n\nBiden should do nothing less to Trump.\n\nMaria Cardona is a principal at the Dewey Square Group, a Democratic strategist and a CNN/CNN Espa\u00f1ol political commentator.
