Mr Whelan, who is employed as a security adviser for a US car parts company, denies any knowledge of supposedly classified contents of this drive.\n\nHe says it was passed to him by a long-time friend, a Russian intelligence officer, shortly before his arrest.\n\nThe case has raised questions from the start. Typically in spy stings, Russia leaks video and other evidence to sympathetic television networks. That has not been forthcoming this time.\n\nThere was also a toxic geopolitical backdrop to the arrest, coming amid terrible Russia-US relations; frequent arrests of Russian nationals accused of hacking offences; and shortly after Russian citizen Maria Butina pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a foreign agent in the US\n\nBut there also appeared to be unusual aspects to Mr Whelan\u2019s profile: his friendship with the alleged FSB officer; his contact with other men in the security and army sphere; and his multiple UK-United States-Candian-Irish citizenships.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In hindsight, he was naive to imagine the FSB wasn\u2019t a much more corrupted version of the FBI.\u201d\n\nGeopolitics was the only thing that mattered: \u201cThis is all about Russia using Paul, keeping him isolated to extract what it can from America.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would signal the complete degradation of their intelligence service, and I don\u2019t buy it. This is fake.\u201d Retired KGB general Alexei Konadurov\n\nSecurity professionals generally concur that there is little in Paul Whelan\u2019s Russia file that matches the profile of a bona fide intelligence agent.\n\nAlexei Kondaurov, a retired KGB general and Kremlin critic, said it was inconceivable that the United States would consider assigning someone \u201cso unprepared\u201d to conduct a dangerous operation on hostile soil.\n\n\u201cEven in the age of Trump, I cannot imagine the United States sending such a hapless guy over,\u201d the retired spy said. \u201cIt would signal the complete degradation of their intelligence service, and I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d\n\nInstead, revenge was the likely reason for Mr Whelan getting caught in the crossfires, he suggested.\n\n\u201cThink of it as an exchange of courtesies,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cYou can understand the logic: you arrest our people, and we will arrest yours.\u201d\n\nMr Whelan\u2019s 10 months in detention have been replete with such \u201ccourtesies\u201d.\n\nAlmost from the start, Mr Whelan complained of poor prison conditions and a lack of medical care. In August, he was moved from a newly renovated cell to one with dirt and broken tiles \u2014 a sanction, his brother asserts, for making a complaint. His hernia was aggravated, to the extent that it now needs an operation.\n\nMr Whelan has been banned from making phone calls to his family. Even his state-appointed lawyers have been denied access on occasion.\n\nHis multiple citizenships \u2014 a consequence of his family\u2019s history of migration \u2014 have become a communication lifeline for the family. Visits from consular officials from all four countries have allowed the family to exchange limited information \u201conce or twice\u201d a month.\n\nBut while officials in the US embassy have acted as a critical link, those higher up the chain have been more notable for their silence.\n\nDonald Trump, for example, has avoided making any significant statement on the affair. The US State Department has, meanwhile, been remarkably non-committal, limiting public comments to requests for \u201cevidence\u201d.\n\nThat lack of public activity disquieted the family so much that they lobbied the house for the resolution it eventually adopted. They hope that such publicity will keep pressure on the White House.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the trial is political theatre and that a decision has to come at a much higher, political, level,\u201d David Whelan said.\n\n\u201cOur calculus has always been that we need a political solution, too.\u201d", "description": "A former US\u00a0Marine being held by Moscow on disputed espionage charges has used a court appearance\u00a0to allege he had been assaulted by prison guards and threatened with a gun.
