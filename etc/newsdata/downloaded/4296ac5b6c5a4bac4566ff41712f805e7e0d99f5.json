While browsing Trustpilot recently, I spotted something of a curiosity: there was a stark difference between the average star ratings that Argos and John Lewis, two of our best-known high street stores held, and it was one that bucks the acknowledged status.\n\nSome well established companies pay hundreds of pounds every month to review websites\n\nJohn Lewis, one of Britain's favourite department stores, renowned for its knowledgeable staff and good service, only has an average of 1.7 stars on its Trustpilot page out of five, with 70 per cent of customers rating it as bad.\n\nMeanwhile, Argos, a high street stalwart better known for its catalogues than perhaps its expertise and customer care, has a much higher average of four-and-a-half stars.\n\nSo, do we have it wrong on these two shops? Is John Lewis letting down customers down left, right and centre, while Argos is delighting most?\n\nPuzzled by how this seemed somewhat strange, I was inspired to dig a bit deeper.\n\nIt doesn't take long on Trustpilot to uncover other examples of businesses scoring very differently to each other in a way that could surprise those who shop their regularly.\n\nSimilarly, Oasis, a popular womenswear chain, has four and a half stars on the world's largest review site but Topshop only has one and a half. Again, this seemed strange considering both brands are well known and in the same industry.\n\nA crucial difference to be considered is that Argos and Oasis are paying members of Trustpilot, whilst John Lewis and Topshop are not.\n\nBy looking at their respective Trustpilot pages, it is possible to tell whether they pay the site or not, by checking to see if the company subscribes to Trustpilot's business service.\n\nTrustpilot says paying for its service does not enable companies to improve their reviews, delete negative feedback, or get any other unfair edge.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for the firm said that there is an element that can explain some of the big variations in scores between companies that pay it and don't.\n\nSubscribers, such as Argos, are likely to be actively encouraging all shoppers to leave reviews - and thus bagging more scores from happy punters - whereas firms that don't subscribe, such as John Lewis, do not push for feedback from all customers and are therefore more likely to be skewed towards those seeking to review them on Trustpilot when they have had a bad experience.\n\nWhat do companies get if they sign up to Trustpilot?\n\nTrustpilot has three paid versions: the 'Lite' plan is available from \u00a3165 per month and the 'Pro' site can be bought from \u00a3449 a month.\n\nThen there is also the option for the 'enterprise' plan which is tailored to the customer, with no price listed, but it is believed to be far higher than the Pro package.\n\nAll of these plans must be paid for annually \u2013 meaning firms must stump thousands upfront for the service.\n\nThis will show up on a company's page if they are a paying member of Trustpilot\n\nHowever, 87 per cent of the businesses on Trustpilot do use the service for free with the free model allowing users to still invite, respond and report reviews.\n\nSo why would someone pay for the service?\n\nFor those paying the higher amounts, they will have access to an account manager or a customer success manager.\n\nThey will also have access to Trustpilot's marketing tools in order to push for more positive reviews.\n\nNo matter which service you pay for, or if you don't pay at all, Trustpilot says if you report a review on your page as unfair and it is found to violate its guidelines but it can be brought into line, e.g. if it contains offensive words that can be removed, it will be temporarily hidden until the review's author makes the appropriate changes.\n\nIt seems then that companies could report multiple reviews as unfair, even if perhaps they are not, as they can sometimes be hidden for up to two days, thus leaving them with more positive reviews showing on their page.\n\nArgos and John Lewis have very different average reviews - likely due to Argos paying the site\n\nQuestions raised over Trustpilot reviews\n\nAs with any successful business, Trustpilot has its supporters and critics.\n\nInvestigations have previously looked at the possibility of gaming the system, including research by BBC 5 Live Investigates, which found that it was possible to buy a false, five-star recommendation placed on Trustpilot via a Facebook group.\n\nCompany pages On Trustpilot, all company profile pages are defined as either: Asking for reviews: The company has claimed its profile on Trustpilot and regularly asks its customers for reviews. Claimed: The company has claimed its profile on Trustpilot and has access to its Business Account, but we don't have information that the company is actively asking for reviews. Unclaimed: The company hasn't claimed its profile on Trustpilot and we don't have information that the company is actively asking for reviews.\n\nThese groups had been set up to encourage customers to buy a product from a website and post a positive review on Amazon or Trustpilot, for example, in return for a full refund.\n\nMeanwhile, a Times investigation earlier this year revealed that some estate agents and banks were found to be playing the system to help them gain better review scores.\n\nIt said the online estate agent, Purplebricks had 62,000 Trustpilot reviews and a score of 9.5 out of ten. However, Countrywide, one of Britain's largest estate agents, has only 123 reviews and a score of one out of ten.\n\nThe difference found was that Countrywide is not a paying subscriber to Trustpilot but Purplebricks is.\n\nTrustpilot said it had invested in time and technology to eradicate the practice.\n\nIt then published an open letter in 2017 specifically addressing claims made about about Purplebricks and its use of the site. It said the site had not contravened any of its guidelines and emphasised that its takes reports of any fake reviews very seriously.\n\nFirms who pay Trustpilot a monthly fee gain access to analytics and can advertise their score\n\nThis is Money was also recently contacted by a whistleblower, who asked not to be identified, who claimed that paying members can get more control over their reviews and ratings than those who refuse to pay.\n\nThe source claimed that a previous company they worked at was annoyed by the amount of negative reviews that were left on their page from years ago, when they partnered with different firms, which was skewing ratings for their current activities.\n\nThey alleged that Trustpilot representatives said they were unable to remove the negative reviews, but heavily implied that they would be better able to help if the company signed up for a \u00a3500 per month subscription.\n\nTrustpilot will reveal on the page when companies are asking for reviews from their customers\n\nAfter subscribing, the source found it far easier to remove these inaccurate reviews.\n\nHowever, this is a claim that Trustpilot strenuously deny and to protect the source's identity we were unable to give exact details of the company they worked for, so Trustpilot was not able to investigate fully.\n\nA Trustpilot spokesperson said: 'This is a very serious allegation that goes against everything we stand for at Trustpilot. If evidence were presented to us we would investigate it thoroughly. If an individual were to make a misguided promise, it would be a dismissable offence.\n\nGet in touch Have you worked at a review website or work for a company that has been quoted large sums to have a review website account manager? Get in touch: grace.gausden@thisismoney.co.uk\n\nThe fact is, no company can delete their reviews on Trustpilot and no salesperson within our organisation can do this on their behalf - our systems simply do not allow it.\n\n'All companies must abide by exactly the same rules whether they use our platform for free or purchase additional services from us. This is in contrast to other review platforms, where a company can pre-moderate and unpublish reviews they don't like.'\n\nTrustpilot says the reason people pay monthly amounts is to have access to analytics and also to be able to advertise their rating on their website.\n\nA company, however, would pay more than \u00a3400 a month for that service whilst paying to display their reviews also suggests confidence that they have more positive reviews to show.\n\nLooking at review sites is often how people decide whether to make a purchase or not\n\nHow has Trustpilot made reviews more transparent?\n\nTrustpilot has faced criticism before and earlier this year, it changed its policy to make it easier for the public to detect when companies are trying to stop complaints posted to its platform.\n\nAmazon reviews Millions of Amazon shoppers are at risk of buying a sub-par product, thanks to fake reviews, according to research by Which?. Popular items such as headphones, vacuum cleaners, dash cams and Bluetooth speakers that perform badly have positive reviews on the site. Which? tested eight 'recommended' products with most of them falling short of an average performance score with three performing so badly they were rated as a 'Don't Buy'. The consumer group said a sudden surge of positive reviews over a short period should be seen as a tell-tale sign they are unreliable and that fake reviews are used routinely by unscrupulous online sellers to undermine honest small businesses legitimately using online marketplaces to reach new audiences.\n\nIt said it will now reveal how many reviews each company has flagged for investigation over the previous year, which causes them to be hidden.\n\nIt will also say how many of the posts were subsequently returned online and how many were deleted.\n\nRetail experts say a close eye needs to be paid to review sites, because they play an increasingly important part in people's shopping decisions.\n\nGraham Wynn, assistant director of business & regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said: 'Online review websites play an important part in informing customers about both products and companies.\n\n'It is vital that these websites observe both EU and UK laws, provide only authentic reviews and that any commercial relationships between review websites and retailers are made clear.\n\n'The retail industry notes that new higher penalties for breaches of consumer protection law, including redress for misleading consumers are currently being introduced.'\n\nCan you trust a review site?\n\nOnline reviews can be an invaluable tool when buying something or signing up to use a company, however, they should not be used in isolation.\n\nA healthy level of scepticism should be employed when reading reviews and particularly enthusiastic or deeply negative posts should be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\nCheck for suspicious patterns and look for a general consensus - and look for reviews specific to the type of good or service you are buying.\n\nThere will always be ways that companies can get around people leaving negative reviews - or encourage overly positive ones - with many willing to pay to do so.\n\nWhilst online reviews will no doubt continue to be a cornerstone for customers looking to get advice on a potential new purchase, it goes to show that people should be aware that not everything they read is true.\n\nIt is also a sign that actually taking a trip down to your local shop and having a look at a product in person, or seeking the expertise of a well trained shop assistant, could still be the best way to judge whether a product is worth your money or not.", "description": "Thousands of consumers leave their thoughts on stores, holidays and brands online everyday, influencing thousands of other customers shopping habits.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
