The Labour lawmaker was murdered a week before Britain\u2019s European Union membership referendum by a far-right attacker shouting \u201cdeath to traitors.\u201d\n\nCabinet minister Nicky Morgan tweeted that \u201cwe all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us.\u201d\n\nJohnson was criticized by members of several parties and by Cox\u2019s widower.\n\nTempers have been inflamed in Parliament as the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline gets closer.\n\nAs the session resumed Thursday, Commons Speaker John Bercow urged moderation.\n\n\u201cThere was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I\u2019ve known in my 22 years in the House,\u201d Bercow said. \u201cThe culture was toxic.\u201d\n\nBercow implored members of Parliament to \u201ctreat each other as opponents, not as enemies.\u201d\n\nJohnson is in a showdown with Parliament over his plan to take Britain out of the EU on the scheduled deadline, even if there is no divorce deal to smooth the way.\n\nJohnson says he wants to strike an agreement with the bloc, but the EU says it is still waiting for useful proposals to come from Britain to unblock stalled negotiations.\n\nEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said Thursday that he is \u201cstill ready to work on any new legal and operational proposal\u201d from Johnson, but indicated insufficient progress had been achieved in the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe are still waiting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EU already had a deal with the U.K. on departure terms, but it was rejected in the British parliament. Johnson now wants to drastically renegotiate the agreement or leave without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\n___\n\nRaf Casert in Brussels, and Gregory Katz in London, contributed to this report.", "description": "Members of Parliament warned that the prime minister should be more cautious with his tone, given the 2016 killing of legislator Jo Cox.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8c87c8210000fa025e25fb.jpeg?cache=e6wfqbdz4s&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
