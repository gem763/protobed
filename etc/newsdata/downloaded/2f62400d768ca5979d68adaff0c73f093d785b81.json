The president tweeted that morning that Alabama was one of the states that would \u201cmost likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d even though the latest projections placed Dorian creeping up the east coast, away from the Gulf. Only a small corner of Alabama was at risk, and only with a 10 percent probability of tropical-storm-force winds. So the Birmingham office put out a tweet after Trump\u2019s to try to calm people, stressing that \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\u201d\n\nAfter many days of Trump doubling down and the media tripling down and Trump quadrupling down on whether his initial tweet was right or wrong, the Times reported on Monday that none other than Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, had phoned NOAA last Friday and demanded that the agency put out a statement siding with Trump, reportedly even threatening to fire people if they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s what got Democrats\u2019 attention: Exactly how far up the federal bureaucracy did this dispute, which was about nothing more than whether the president made a minor mistake in using outdated information in a tweet, go? Did the pressure on NOAA originate with Ross or did it go even higher?\n\nOf course it went higher, claims WaPo in a new story this afternoon. This clusterfark is poles apart in significance from the aborted invite to the Taliban to come to Camp David but it\u2019s similar in one important respect: There\u2019s only one person in the federal government who conceivably could have thought it was a good idea. Wilbur Ross doesn\u2019t care if the NWS corrected Trump on a mistake he made. Mick Mulvaney doesn\u2019t care either. If you could ask them off the record, doubtless even Melania and the Trump children wouldn\u2019t care.\n\nOnly one person cares.\n\nPresident Trump told his staff that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration needed to correct a tweet that seemed to contradict his statement that Hurricane Dorian posed a significant threat to Alabama as of Sept. 1, in contrast to what the agency\u2019s forecasters were predicting at the time. This led chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to call Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to tell him to fix the issue, senior administration officials said. Trump had complained for several days about the issue, according to senior officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter\u2026 Trump told reporters he did not direct NOAA to issue such a statement on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cNo, I never did that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI never did that. It\u2019s a hoax by the media. That\u2019s just fake news, right from the beginning, it was a fake story.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t directly deputize Ross, said the NYT in its own story about this. Mick Mulvaney was put on the case and then he got on the phone with Ross, albeit without demanding that Ross threaten anyone over it:\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publicly disavow the forecasters\u2019 position that Alabama was not at risk. NOAA, which is part of the Commerce Department, issued an unsigned statement last Friday in response, saying that the Birmingham, Ala., office was wrong to dispute the president\u2019s warning. In pressing NOAA\u2019s acting administrator to take action, Mr. Ross warned that top employees at the agency could be fired if the situation was not addressed, The New York Times previously reported. Mr. Ross\u2019s spokesman has denied that he threatened to fire anyone, and a senior administration official on Wednesday said Mr. Mulvaney did not tell the commerce secretary to make such a threat.\n\nCongrats to Mulvaney on finally achieving the highest aspiration of the tea party, bossing around weathermen for correcting the president on a minor factual mistake. If small-government fans can\u2019t hold the deficit below a trillion dollars a year in an age of rapid economic growth, they can at least muscle some nerds into eating sh*t on a quibble over a hurricane projection.\n\nYou can read the full letter sent to Ross today by Democrats on the House Science Committee right here. Key bit:\n\nTheir first question for him is whether anyone in the Executive Office of the President communicated with him about leaning on NOAA on Trump\u2019s behalf. What will he say?\n\nI think there\u2019s a nonzero chance at this point that Ross ends up quitting. Not because this is a mega-scandal \u2014 most people who pay attention to it will be dumbstruck by how small the stakes are \u2014 but because he\u2019s 81, reportedly falls asleep in meetings, and Trump might relish the opportunity to install a hardcore protectionist at Commerce in Ross\u2019s place who can help him sell the trade war to the public. Obviously Trump\u2019s not going to fire him for carrying out the president\u2019s wishes in this instance but the White House might use the controversy to gently suggest to Ross that he should consider retirement.
