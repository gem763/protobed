Prime Minister Adel Abdul Madhi moved Lt. Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, who worked with US and coalition forces to rout ISIS, to the Defense Ministry without warning or explanation.\n\nVisit Business Insider's home page for more stories.\n\nOne protester is dead and 200 wounded, according to Iraq's health ministry , after police used tear gas, water cannon and live fire to disperse demonstrators in Baghdad on Tuesday. Thousands of Iraqis rallied in protest against unemployment, government corruption, and poor services, as well as the ouster of popular Counter-Terrorism Services commander Lt. Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi.\n\nPolice initially opened fire in the air and it was not clear if they subsequently shot into the crowd, but Reuters reporters saw five protesters with blood covering their faces. Ambulances rushed in to transport more wounded. Agence France-Presse reporter Maya Gebeily reported the casualties via Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe protesters, numbering about 3,000, had tried to cross a bridge leading into Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies.\n\nSecurity forces, who had blocked roads, used stun grenades and water cannons to push back crowds. Protesters refused to leave and so security forces opened fire.\n\n\"This is not a government, it is a bunch of parties and militias who destroyed Iraq,\" said one protestor who declined to give his name out of fear of reprisal.\n\nGebeily reported that the gunshots resumed after a brief respite, and reinfocements had been called in to help quell the protests.\n\nShi'ite Muslim militias known as Popular Mobilisation Forces play a large role in Iraqi politics and have representation in parliament and government.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdul Madhi moved al-Saadi to a job in the Defense Ministry last week without explanation, the Associated Press reported. Al-Saadi had become a key part of the anti-ISIS fight, working alongside US and coalition partners to eject the extremist group from Iraq, most recently in an air strike on an island in the Tigris River that al-Saadi said ISIS used \"like a hotel.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, al-Saadi had been growing in popularity among Iraqis, potentially concerning some Iran-aligned politicians.\n\nAbdul Mahdi, who chaired the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, issued a statement promising jobs for graduates. He instructed the oil ministry and other government bodies to start including a 50% quota for local workers in subsequent contracts with foreign companies.\n\nIraq saw massive protests last year which first erupted in the south, heartland of the Shi'ite majority. Clashes took place between security forces and protesters incensed by collapsing infrastructure, frequent power cuts, and widespread corruption.\n\nOil-rich Iraq has suffered for decades under the rule of Saddam Hussein and U.N. sanctions, the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and civil war it unleashed, and the battle against Islamic State, which was declared won in 2017. Graft is widespread and basic services like power and water are lacking.\n\n(Reporting by Thaier al-Sudani and Haider Kadhim; Additional reporting by Khaled Abdul Qader; Writing by Ahmed Rasheed and Ahmed Aboulenein, Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "description": "The lack of jobs and critical infrastructure, as well as the sacking of a popular counter-ISIS commander, led to protests in Baghdad Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9387d22e22af5e5d300363?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
