Indeed, photographers caught Mr Zelensky, who was a well known comedian before entering politics, grimacing.\n\nMr Trump defended his decision to involve his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, to liaise with Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden and his son, along with other cases involving alleged corruption.\n\n\u201cRudy Giuliani is a great lawyer, he was a great mayor, he\u2019s highly respected. I\u2019ve watched the passion he\u2019d had on television over the last few days,\u201d said Mr Trump, seemingly ignoring the point Mr Giuliani has no formal position within the administration.\n\n\u201cIncredible what he\u2019s done. What he has done, he wants to find out where did this Russian witch-hunt. Where did it start? How come it started?\u201d\n\nMr Trump also denied asking House speaker Nancy Pelosi for a way out of possible impeachment proceedings when they spoke on Tuesday morning. He claimed she had \u201clost her way\u201d and that her party had been taken over by its progressive wing\n\n\u201cNo way. She\u2019s lost her way. She\u2019s been taken over by the radical left,\u201d he said. \u201cShe may be radical left herself, but she really has lost her way.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
