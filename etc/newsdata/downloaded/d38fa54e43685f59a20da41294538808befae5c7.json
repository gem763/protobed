He is backed by former president Ian Khama, who handed over to Masisi last year but has since fallen into a bitter power struggle with him.\n\n\u201cWe remain resolute and confident that we are going to win this election,\u201d Boko told a news conference on Monday night before warning of possible fraud.\n\n\u201cI can only accept the result if the election is free and credible,\u201d he added, raising the spectre that Botswana, which has only known one-sided elections, could witness its first rancorous dispute over a tight result.\n\nOf Botswana\u2019s population of 2.2 million people, 924,000 registered voters will elect 57 national assembly and 490 local government representatives.\n\nThe winning party\u2019s candidate then becomes president.\n\nPolls open at 6:30 a.m. (0430 GMT) and close at 7 p.m.\n\nMasisi is standing on his record on tackling corruption, such as making a declaration of assets obligatory for public sector officials, and slashing bureaucracy for small businesses.\n\nKhama, the son of founding president Seretse Khama, quarrelled with Masisi over cabinet posts and the new president\u2019s controversial scrapping of an elephant hunting ban in May, which Khama had enforced four years earlier. Elephants, however, have not been an issue during the campaign.\n\nThe main concerns for the Batswana are unemployment hovering at around 20% and stark inequalities despite equitable state spending on health and education. To tackle either, the winner will need to do more to diversify the economy.\n\nMbakisi Gopolang, 25, waiting in line to cast his vote at a primary school in the capital Gaborone, said he was disappointed by the last decade under the governing BDP.\n\n\u201cThe last ten years have been regressive, so I don\u2019t want continuation of that. I am voting for a party that will drive economic growth, empower citizens and get rid of corruption and bring about transparency.\u201d\n\nDiamond mining has fallen to a fifth of GDP in 2018, compared with half in the 1990s, but it still makes up three quarters of foreign exchange earnings, even as banking and tourism grab a greater share of output.", "description": "Botswana polls opened on Wednesday for a general election that is expected to provide the first genuine challenge to the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in its five decades of dominance over southern Africa's wealthiest and most stable nation.", "authors": ["Brian Benza", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444028559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0IZ-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
