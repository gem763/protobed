They chanted slogans like \u201cFight for Freedom\u201d and \u201cLiberate Hong Kong,\u201d and demanded the government answer for months of unresolved political stalemate and the increasingly violent tactics used by the city\u2019s police force.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Hong Kong is worsening,\u201d a student from the University of Hong Kong said on stage, his face hidden behind goggles and a mask. \u201cAll those who hold Hong Kong values close to them, all those who are proud to be called Hong Kongers are now targeted and suppressed by the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must continue to be brave during these abnormal times,\u201d he added.\n\nA student holds a poster reading \u2018boycott\u2019 at a rally to kick off a city-wide class boycott at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. (Diana Chan for VICE News)\n\nEarlier in the day, more than a thousand secondary school students held a separate rally in support of the protests, calling on their peers to boycott classes as the new year began. Many other students held in-school protests to show their support for the sprawling movement. The police, meanwhile, came under fire for stationing teams outside multiple high schools throughout the city, checking students\u2019 school bags in train stations.\n\nStudents have spearheaded the pro-democracy movement since it kicked off in June against Hong Kong\u2019s proposed extradition bill, that would have given Beijing the power to extradite wanted individuals to mainland China. Many residents saw the bill as Beijing\u2019s attempt to tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous city.\n\nHopes that the protests would die down once the students headed back to school were dashed as thousands of young people joined rallies across the city, many expressing their resolve to continue to protest until their demands are met.\n\nCity leader Carrie Lam says the bill is \u2018dead\u2019, but protesters have grown their demands since the movement\u2019s early days. They now want the government to meet their five demands, which includes officially withdrawing the bill and launching an independent investigation to examine the police\u2019s use of force.\n\nAlvin (L), a freshman at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, attends the class boycott rally with his friend (R).

He said that skipping classes gives time for students to protest and that fighting against the government was part of their duty as Hong Kongers.\n\n\n\nMany students at the rally were dressed like him, donning helmets, goggles and gas masks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dressed in full gear because I want people to see what I have to wear in order to feel safe when I go out to protests,\u201d said Alvin, a freshman studying social sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cI want them to know what we are faced with every day.\u201d\n\nThousands of students attend a rally to kick off a city-wide class boycott at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. (Diana Chan for VICE News)\n\nOrganizers estimated that up to 300,000 students attended the university rally, which followed a weekend of renewed violence and unrest. On Saturday evening, riot police stormed onto subway trains, hitting and arresting passengers and protesters with batons, a large barricade was set alight by protesters in a busy shopping district. Hours later, thousands of demonstrators crowded into city\u2019s airport Sunday, causing major traffic jams after public transportation was suspended and many were forced to walk for hours to get back into the city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dressed in full gear because I want people to see what I have to wear in order to feel safe when I go out to protests\u201d\n\nThe police say that 159 people were arrested over the weekend and 16 were charged with rioting. More than a thousand have been arrested since the large scale protests began in June.\n\nStudents at a rally to kick off a city-wide class boycott at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
