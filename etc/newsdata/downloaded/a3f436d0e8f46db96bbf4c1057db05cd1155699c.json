It would cause an economic loss to our economy to rival that seen after the financial crash, and according to the government\u2019s own analysis would push down wages by around \u00a3150 a month for someone on the UK average income.\n\nThe economic shock will starve our public services of the cash they need, leaving the NHS and our schools without vital funding. It is a far cry from the wild promises made by Vote Leave, which boasted of extra cash for our health service once we left the EU.\n\nAnd the removal of the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d between the UK and the EU means that vital protections for workers risk being stripped away, not to mention the environmental protections which are so essential for tackling the climate emergency.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal is economic and cultural vandalism that no government should ever willingly inflict on the country they govern. And that is why it has to go back to the people so that they can have the final say on this specific Brexit deal. That is why I will be marching, along with hundreds and thousands of others, to make sure we are heard.\n\nOur voices will be ringing out to demand that we be an open-hearted, caring and inclusive country that looks to work with our neighbours, not turn our backs on them. Our best future is one where we work together with our closest allies to tackle the big issues we face, like the climate emergency and international terrorism. I want to live in a world where we are free to travel across borders, where people can live, work and love across Europe without barriers.\n\nThat is the country I will be marching for, and I want every MP who is considering voting for this deal to hear our voices loud and clear when it is time to vote in parliament. That is especially true of those Labour MPs flirting with the idea of marching through the voting lobbies with Boris Johnson and helping him deliver his bad Brexit deal. If Brexit is delivered by Labour votes, Remainers will never forget that.\n\nBoris Johnson is determined to force this bad deal on the country, just as he attempted to force no-deal on the country.\n\nI want him to know we are not going to let him. Whatever happens tomorrow, our fight is not over.\n\n\n\nJo Swinson is leader of the Liberal Democrats", "description": "The 19th October is set to be an historic day for our country.
