USA TODAY\n\nAs soon as Oklahoma fell behind by 25 points on Saturday at Kansas State, you could practically hear the clickety-clack of keyboards all over America declaring the Sooners dead in the College Football Playoff race.\n\nBut have we learned nothing over the last half-decade?\n\nThough Oklahoma\u2019s eventual 48-41 loss was undoubtedly the most significant result of Week 9 and puts the Big 12 in a less favorable position going into November, it would be ridiculous at this juncture to start eliminating one-loss teams who can still win their league.\n\nRemember, since the Playoff began, only one outright conference champion with one loss has missed the playoff: Ohio State last season.\n\nWhile Oklahoma\u2019s performance was ugly in many respects and represents a major regression for a defense that had played well up to this point, there\u2019s no comparison between this effort by the Sooners and Ohio State\u2019s 49-20 loss to Purdue last season that was deemed unforgivable by the selection committee.\n\nIn fact, for all the issues Oklahoma encountered, they were a replay-overturned onside kick away from giving the ball back to Jalen Hurts with about 1 minute, 40 seconds left with a chance to tie the game. That\u2019s little consolation for the Sooners, especially because the ball caromed off an Oklahoma player maybe half a yard before it would have been a legal onside kick, but the quality of loss does matter. The fact Oklahoma fought back may end up as an important data point when it\u2019s all said and done.\n\nMore: Furious rally might be biggest victory for Oklahoma in loss to Kansas State\n\nWeek 9 winners and losers: Oklahoma, Ohio State lead the way\n\nOklahoma head coach Lincoln Riley talks to quarterback Jalen Hurts during the first quarter against Kansas State. (Photo: Scott Sewell, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nRegardless, if this season has taught us anything, it\u2019s that anyone can have a bad week. Georgia lost at home to South Carolina. Wisconsin looked great until it got popped by Illinois. The health of Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is uncertain after a high ankle sprain. Clemson hasn\u2019t quite put things together yet and was fortunate to beat North Carolina.\n\nIn other words, while Oklahoma may well get knocked back to around No. 10 in the polls this week, it feels like there are still plenty more potential losses out there for the first flight of Playoff contenders. The Sooners wounded themselves in a pretty significant way with their defensive faceplant in Manhattan, but it\u2019s too early to eliminate them from the race.\n\nHere are nine other observations from Week 9 in college football:\n\nOhio State is the only team that has shown no flaws\n\nLet\u2019s face it, there\u2019s a beauty contest component to this sport. Sometimes just winning is enough, but if you can win and look good doing it, you\u2019re going to separate yourself from the pack of contenders and get a lot more benefit of the doubt in the subjective College Football Playoff process.\n\nSo far this season, Ohio State is the only team that has passed the eye test in every way, every week. The Buckeyes may prove to be mortal, but for now they look impenetrable. And in a sport where it\u2019s natural to nitpick certain flaws that each of the top teams might have, it\u2019s been real difficult through eight games to find anything wrong with Ohio State.\n\nMore: Big-time players have Ohio State looking like the No. 1 team\n\nThe Buckeyes got challenged briefly in the third quarter by Wisconsin but rolled off 28 straight points and cruised to a 38-7 win. Everything about this effort was impressive visually, including J.K. Dobbins rushing for 163 yards on 20 carries, quarterback Justin Fields making some timely key throws in tough weather conditions and a Buckeye defense that held Wisconsin to 191 yards and created two turnovers.\n\nThough Ohio State may well get a challenge from Penn State on Nov. 23, Michigan on Nov. 30 and in the Big Ten title game, it\u2019s hard to argue with an average margin of victory of 40.3 points at this juncture of the season. If the Buckeyes have a flaw, it hasn't been exposed yet.\n\nChase Young won\u2019t win the Heisman, but might be the nation\u2019s best player\n\nThe other big story to emerge from Columbus on Saturday was defensive end Chase Young emerging as a legitimate Heisman Trophy contender. Though he probably won\u2019t win it \u2014 the bar is just too high for a defensive player, particularly in a year with so many quarterbacks putting up big numbers \u2014 Young is having a season reminiscent of Ndamukong Suh in 2009 at Nebraska when he made it to New York as a finalist.\n\nYoung has been an unblockable, one-man wrecking crew all season but saved his best for Wisconsin, sacking quarterback Jack Coan four times and forcing two fumbles. Young now has 13.5 sacks through eight games, which is more than Suh's 12 in the 2009 season. He\u2019ll almost certainly set the Ohio State single-season record (he needs just one to tie Vernon Gholston), but his value isn\u2019t necessarily just about numbers. Play after play, Young disrupts everything no matter which side of the line he\u2019s playing on or if they drop him back and use him as a de facto linebacker. With Ohio State\u2019s defense becoming one of the best in the country this year after a mediocre performance last season, it\u2019s fair to say no individual player in the country has had a bigger impact on their team. Even LeBron James noticed Young\u2019s dominance, tweeting about him during the game.\n\nChase Young stop it man!! Absolute MONSTER!! Matter of fact don\u2019t listen to me, keep going Young \ud83e\udd34\ud83c\udffd #GoBucks \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 26, 2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably the most dominant player in college football,\u201d Ohio State coach Ryan Day said.\n\nAt this point, it's hard to disagree.\n\nMichigan knocks out a Playoff contender, resets narrative on season\n\nThe good news is that Jim Harbaugh finally has a signature win to point to \u2013 and it was a doozy, as the Wolverines dominated No. 7 Notre Dame, 45-14. The bad news is that only changed the outcome of Notre Dame\u2019s season, as the Irish will not be heading to the Playoff for a second straight year.\n\nAs for the Wolverines, this doesn\u2019t change the destination for 2019. They\u2019re not going to the Playoff, and they can\u2019t erase what was a very underwhelming first half of the season. But give Michigan credit for taking the moment built in the second half last week against Penn State and playing good, solid football against Notre Dame from start-to-finish despite some tough conditions, including a mid-game monsoon.\n\nMichigan may not be able to make the Big Ten title game this year, but it can hit the reset button on the Harbaugh era if it performs like this down the stretch. After some reports surfaced earlier this week that Harbaugh might be looking for an exit ramp back to the NFL \u2014 these reports seem to pop up every year, and Harbaugh knocked them down just like he has in the past \u2014 it was different this time. Harbaugh\u2019s lack of big wins and the fact his contract has dwindled to a couple years remaining is a natural tinder box for speculation about his future.\n\nBut if Michigan can carry this momentum down the stretch, the vibes around Harbaugh going into 2020 will be much more positive.\n\nMac Jones gave Alabama some confidence\n\nThe sight of Tua Tagovailoa on the sidelines in street clothes and a walking boot is enough to make Alabama fans very nervous with two weeks to go before the showdown against LSU. But at least there was some good news Saturday in how backup Mac Jones performed in a 48-7 victory over Arkansas.\n\nThough Alabama doesn\u2019t anticipate starting Jones against LSU \u2014 coach Nick Saban said Tagovailoa could return to practice this week \u2014 it was still good to see him play efficiently against Arkansas, completing 18-of-22 passes for 235 yards and three touchdowns. Against the worst team in the SEC, Jones obviously didn\u2019t face the type of pressure he would see regularly as the starter, but Alabama looked competent enough with him under center that you could envision this team winning a lot of games if Tagovailoa couldn\u2019t come back.\n\nAnd, who knows, Jones may have to play some against LSU. No matter what Alabama officials say about Tagovailoa's recovery from the high ankle sprain suffered just a week ago, it is an undeniably tight timeline for him to get back on the field, much less feel like he\u2019s 100% on the ankle. After 1\u00bd games, Jones now has enough reps to feel comfortable if he has to play in a pressurized situation.\n\nPenn State at Minnesota will be the 'other' Game of the Year on Nov. 9\n\nWhile the nation\u2019s attention in two weeks will be focused on Alabama-LSU, who could have imagined that a game in Minneapolis would get second billing?\n\nMinnesota \u2014 yes, Minnesota \u2014 is 8-0 going into its bye week and will re-emerge on Nov. 9 at home against a Penn State team that is also 8-0 and has probably been underrated by the national media.\n\nUnderstand, Minnesota hasn\u2019t been 8-0 since it finished undefeated in 1940 and 1941 when the Gophers claimed national championships. So this is going to be a really big deal, and we\u2019re about to get inundated with another round of stories focused on coach P.J. Fleck, who put together a 13-0 season at Western Michigan in 2016 before losing to Wisconsin in the Cotton Bowl.\n\nMinnesota coach P.J. Fleck carries wide receiver Tyler Johnson off the field after the team's win over Maryland. (Photo: Jesse Johnson, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBut it\u2019s fun to have new programs pop up and get the kind of attention, if only for a couple weeks, that the Gophers are about to receive.\n\nObviously, this hasn\u2019t been the toughest of schedules so far for Minnesota, which destroyed Maryland 52-10 on Saturday. The best team the Gophers have beaten so far is probably \u2026 Illinois? But the neat part is they\u2019ll get a chance against Penn State to prove whether they\u2019re for real.\n\nBaylor is in the catbird\u2019s seat in the Big 12\n\nThe biggest winner in the Big 12 didn\u2019t even play Saturday. With Oklahoma\u2019s loss, Baylor is now all alone in first place and is two games clear of third place. In other words, the 7-0 Bears are very much in the driver\u2019s seat to make the Big 12 championship game if they can maintain their current level of play over the next month.\n\nThe biggest thing Baylor has going for it is a favorable schedule. The Bears will return from a bye next Saturday against West Virginia and head to TCU after that. But the most interesting part of the month will be back-to-back home games against Oklahoma and Texas on Nov. 16 and Nov. 23, respectively, before finishing up the regular season at Kansas.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of football to play, and certainly it will be a different challenge for Matt Rhule now that his team has a target on its back. But the already amazing story of Baylor\u2019s resurgence under Rhule has a chance to be truly special if the Bears can take advantage of those home games and play for the conference title just three years after the program was decimated by scandal.\n\nThe ACC Coastal is as Coastal-y as ever\n\nIf a football division could be an animal from ancient iconography, the ACC Coastal would be the ouroboros \u2014 a serpent that is forever eating its own tail. As we sit here in the middle of the conference schedule, all seven teams in the Coastal have either two or three losses and many of them have beaten each other.\n\nFirst it was Virginia that looked like it had a leg up on the field before the Cavaliers lost at Louisville, 28-21. Pittsburgh has been the best team in the division based on the eye test, but the Panthers lost at home Saturday to Miami, which lost to Georgia Tech at home last week. North Carolina, which seems to play one-score games on a weekly basis, is right in the middle of the race at 3-2 after beating Duke, 20-17. And Virginia Tech, a team that was basically written off after a terrible loss to Duke, still has a good chance at 2-2 with a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Tar Heels after that epic six-overtime game a week ago.\n\nBut this is really nothing new for college football\u2019s most chaotic division. In fact, six different programs over the last six years have represented the Coastal in the ACC championship game with only Virginia failing to make an appearance.\n\nIt would be a fitting coda to this era of ACC instability outside of Clemson if the Cavaliers could somehow find their way into the title game this year. But even for a division where there\u2019s rarely a clear favorite, it\u2019s been particularly breathtaking this season to see these mediocre teams beat up on each other.\n\nGary Patterson owns Texas\n\nIf not for the approval of Texas, TCU would never have gotten into the Big 12. But when that happened in 2012, TCU was not supposed to be an addition that would seriously threaten the balance of power in the state.\n\nGary Patterson disagreed. Though this has not been a great year for TCU overall, Patterson\u2019s dominance of the Longhorns is as reliable as his propensity to sweat through a shirt no matter the temperature.\n\nOf the many statistics that illustrate how badly Texas has underachieved this decade, none is as stark as this: TCU is 6-2 against the Longhorns since joining the Big 12 after Saturday\u2019s 37-27 victory.\n\nTexas may have more resources, a bigger fan base and stronger recruiting cachet in the state, but TCU has been the demonstrably better program in the 2010s. And you could safely bet your life savings that nobody enjoys that more than Patterson.\n\nMeanwhile, we can probably stop talking about Texas for the rest of this season. After barely escaping Kansas at home last week, it was preposterous that the two-loss Longhorns were ranked 15th. And they didn\u2019t do anything against TCU to prove they were worthy of their ranking as Sam Ehlinger threw four interceptions and the Longhorns\u2019 defense gave up 435 yards. Texas should be out of the Amway Coaches Poll for awhile.\n\nAuburn\u2019s bet on Bo Nix come up snake eyes\n\nIt was always going to be dicey for Gus Malzahn to put Auburn\u2019s season on the shoulders of a true freshman quarterback, but an inability to execute even routine plays in the passing game has proven to be the death knell for the Tigers\u2019 season.\n\nEven with a defense that hung on as long as it could against LSU, coming up with a goal-line stand and a couple turnovers, the Tigers were just inept offensively in a 23-20 loss in Baton Rouge and are now reduced to spoiler status in the SEC.\n\nBo Nix may end up being a great quarterback at Auburn by the time it's all said and done, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s just not ready yet for this stage. In two games this month against ranked opponents, Nix finished 15-for-35 for 157 yards against LSU and 11-for-27 for 145 yards in a loss to Florida. And even though Auburn tried to hang in for awhile in Baton Rouge, leading 13-10 midway through the third quarter, there was just never any threat offensively to put real pressure on LSU.\n\nMore: LSU makes case for No. 1 after defeat of Auburn\n\nThat\u2019s not Nix\u2019s fault. He's a freshman, and he\u2019s playing like a typical freshman who is having to process a lot of information and read the game at a faster speed than he\u2019s ever seen. Instead, the blame should all go to Malzahn, who failed to recruit someone better prepared to take over the job and hasn\u2019t adapted well enough to make the game easier for a quarterback who is clearly struggling.", "description": "Oklahoma's loss was the most significant result of Week 9, but it's ridiculous to suggest the Sooners are out of the College Football Playoff race.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
