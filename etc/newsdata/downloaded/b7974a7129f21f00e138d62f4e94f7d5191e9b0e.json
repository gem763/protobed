REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nBullard, who has focused on the fact that some short-term Treasury debt yields have risen above long-term bond yields in what is sometimes seen as a sign of coming recession, noted that for now the bond \u201cyield curve\u201d look more normal.\n\nBut that is \u201clikely because markets are anticipating future policy moves\u201d by the Fed, Bullard said.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates twice this year, lowering its target rate to a range of between 1.75% and 2.00% at its last meeting. Top officials say they will now make decisions on a \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d basis, with no clear commitment to further reductions.\n\nInvestments in contracts tied to the Fed\u2019s target policy rate show investors expect one to two more quarter point reductions by the end of the year.\n\nBullard dissented at last week\u2019s meeting, arguing for a deeper half point cut on the grounds that the Fed needed to do more to guard against trade risks and a steeper U.S. slowdown given signs the manufacturing sector may already be contracting.\n\nThe central bank has already done a lot, Bullard acknowledged in remarks to the Effingham County Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWhile the Fed has cut short-term interest rates a half a percentage point since July, its overall shift in tone and the removal of previously expected rate hikes have caused longer-term bond rates to fall by more than twice that amount, Bullard said.\n\nStill, he said, the Fed \u201cmay choose to provide additional accommodation going forward\u201d as global trade and other risks threaten to cause the United States to slow more than expected this year, and undercut the Fed\u2019s ability to achieve its 2% inflation target.\n\n\u201cRecent developments in global trade negotiations suggest that it will be difficult to reach a stable global trade regime\u201d anytime soon, Bullard said. \u201cThis is likely chilling global investment and feeding into slower global growth.\u201d", "description": "The Federal Reserve's policy shift since last year has made monetary policy \"considerably more accommodative\" than a year ago, but world markets are likely expecting more to come, St. Louis Federal Reserve bank president James Bullard said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433025428&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1MK", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
