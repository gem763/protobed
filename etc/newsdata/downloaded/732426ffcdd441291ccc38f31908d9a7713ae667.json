I often have band dreams and they're crazy. I'm often with John and just talking about something, and I come to get my Hofner bass, ready to play, and it's covered in sticky tape. You know, dreams.\"\n\nMcCartney then noted that his dreams about Lennon are \"always good.\"\n\nColbert also brought up the fact that McCartney lost his mother when he was just 14. Paul explained how difficult it was for him until he got involved in playing music and met Lennon. He also noted that he and John shared a bond because Lennon's mother also died when he was a teenager.\n\nLater in the show, McCartney revealed that he recently saw the new film \"Yesterday,\" about a struggling musician who, after having an accident, wakes to a world in which he's the only person who knows The Beatles and their music. He then becomes famous by presenting their songs as his own.\n\nMcCartney revealed that he and his wife wanted to watch the movie with an audience, so they sneaked into the back row of a theater.\n\n\"It was a good way to see it,\" McCartney said, adding that he \"thought it was a nice movie\" and \"a pretty good plug for me.\"", "description": "He revealed that he often dreams about late Beatles band mate John Lennon and about playing with his old group.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/paul-john-gty-er-190925_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
