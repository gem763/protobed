This would sometimes work and I'd feel victorious!\u201d\n\nPiper announced the birth of Tallulah on 16 January with an Instagram post featuring a photograph of herself holding her newborn daughter.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago our little girl arrived. She has totally blown our minds. I didn\u2019t know what I was missing but it was you Tallulah,\u201d Piper captioned the post.\n\n\u201cLove you @johnny_s_lloyd wonderful daddy. And to my boys, who will never read this but anyway, two beautiful and attentive brothers. And to all you lovely lot - for messages of joy and luck and goodwill.\"", "description": "Billie Piper has revealed she was initially afraid of having a daughter who would be born into \"a man's world\".\u00a0 In an interview with Stylist magazine, the 36-year-old admitted she had \u201calways worried\u201d about having a daughter, adding that she was \u201csurprised\u201c by how sensitive her two sons have grown up to be.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/30/11/1170968922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
