He feels like he's in prison. - Melissa Acheson, Shawn Hill's partner\n\n\"He doesn't need to be taking an acute care bed in a hospital,\" said Acheson, holding their nine-year-old son Levi as they sat in the hospital's cafeteria.\n\n\"I'm concerned that he will actually start to decline even more cognitively, because he's not getting the interaction and the support that he needs.\"\n\nHill is now waiting for a spot to open up at either a local long-term care home or one of two specialized treatment facilities in Ottawa for people with acquired brain injuries, or ABIs.\n\nThe waitlist for the care home could be anywhere from three months to three years, Acheson said.\n\nFor the specialized centre, it could take a decade or more.\n\n\"He talks to me about how he doesn't understand why he's there. He feels like he's in prison and he doesn't understand what he's done,\" Acheson said.\n\n\"I actually think it's really inhumane.\"\n\nMore programs needed\n\nThere is \"definitely a shortage\" of beds in facilities designed specifically for people with ABIs, said Ruth Wilcock, executive director of the Ontario Brain Injury Association.\n\n\"This is certainly not the first case that we've heard of \u2026 a younger person [potentially] going to a long-term care home,\" said Wilcock.\n\nShawn Hill rests in his bed at the Ottawa Hospital's Civic campus in November 2018, three months after suffering his brain injury, as his partner Melissa Acheson and their son Levi keep him company. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC)\n\nWhile workers at long-term care homes may have some training when it comes to ABIs, Wilcock said specialized facilities are better equipped to handle the challenges brain injury patients present.\n\nIn Ontario, all those facilities are currently full, Wilcock said, because \"the need is so great.\"\n\n\"We definitely need more residential programs for those who are more severely injured, but we [also] need more supports in the community,\" she said.\n\n\"So many people are falling through the cracks.\"\n\nListen to nine-year-old Levi interview his dad\n\nLengthy wait depressing\n\nWhen a CBC reporter visited Hill at the hospital earlier this month, he'd just returned from a walk with a care worker.\n\nHe knew where he was, recognized his family, and understood why he was in the hospital \u2014 although he thought he'd only been there for six weeks, not a full year.\n\n\"He remembers everything, but not in the last year. Not since the damage, since the accident,\" said Hill's father Tom.\n\nThe two go for coffee a few times a week, and Tom said his son sometimes gets \"a little teary\" at the prospect the hospital room may be home for the foreseeable future.\n\nI wish there were more resources \u2014 more of a game plan \u2014 for people like him. - Tom Hill, Shawn Hill's father\n\n\"For him to hear that it's going to be 10 years before he has anything maybe more satisfactory, it would depress you. It would depress me. And it depresses him,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a difficult position for everybody, and I wish there were more resources \u2014 more of a game plan \u2014 for people like him.\"\n\nThe province recently announced $155 million toward home and community care, with $15 million funding \"community-based services\" that would include programs for people with brain injuries, said David Jensen, spokesperson for both the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care.\n\nThe Champlain Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) also began providing $500,000 annually to the Ottawa Hospital in recent years \"specifically for assisted-living services for people with ABI,\" Jensen wrote in an email.\n\nJensen couldn't say, however, how long wait times for ABI-focused facilities are in Ontario.\n\n\"There is no centralized intake process for residential ABI facilities, and the LHIN does not have data on waitlists and wait times. Providers may have that information directly,\" he said.\n\nIdeal outcome 'just isn't possible'\n\nAcheson wishes she could bring Hill home and be his primary caregiver, but that would mean giving up her managerial job at a local grocery store \u2014 a salary she needs to raise their son.\n\nFor now, the two of them visit as much as possible, while also trying to move forward \"in any way we can.\"\n\nMelissa Acheson is now the primary guardian for her nine-year-old son Levi after her long-term partner Shawn Hill suffered a traumatic brain injury in the summer of 2018. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC)\n\nBeing back in the hospital ward, Acheson added, gives her flashbacks to the days immediately after Hill's accident, when no one was sure if he'd even survive.\n\n\"I feel like the outcome that I want just isn't possible,\" Acheson said.\n\n\"But in a perfect world, the outcome would be that Shawn is in a place where he's supported and getting the care that he needs and able to have some kind of quality of life.\"", "description": "Shawn Hill's family says it could be a decade or more before he gets the treatment he needs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308491.1570151398!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/shawn-hill-melissa-acheson-levi-hospital-room-brain-injury.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
