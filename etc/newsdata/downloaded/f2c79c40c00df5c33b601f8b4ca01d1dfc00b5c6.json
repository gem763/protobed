The A\u2019s have won three of their last four games and are 18-7 in September.\n\nThe winningest team in baseball since June 16 with a record of 60-28 the A\u2019s are 33 games over .500 for the first time since 2002.\n\nAnd now all that winning has given them a huge advantage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be 50,000 people in Oakland, I have a feeling,\u201d A\u2019s manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cWhen we get that big a crowd at home, they have an effect. We\u2019re excited about going home in front of our fans. There\u2019s a great bond between us and the fans. And they can get pretty loud.\u201d\n\nOakland used Anderson (13-9) and three relievers for the victory. Anderson gave up three hits, extending his career high for wins. Melvin said he was willing to let Anderson pitch the sixth, but after 10 days rest and with temperatures dropping throughout the game, he began to experience tightness in his elbow.\n\nJesus Luzardo struck out three in the eighth and ninth for his second save, getting out of a jam in the ninth with two runners on base.\n\nThe Mariners\u2019 only real threat came in the fifth inning when Mallex Smith attempted a safety squeeze with the bases loaded. But Matt Olson picked up the bunt attempt barehanded and flipped it to catcher Sean Murphy, who easily tagged out Tom Murphy. It was the 12th shutout of the year for the A\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a handful of guys who can make that play,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cTo be able to come in and have the foresight to charge it and then make a perfect throw on the run, that saved the game. Those guys (in the infield) have been doing that all year. For a guy that doesn\u2019t strike many people out, I need those plays.\u201d\n\nSeattle\u2019s Marco Gonzales (16-13) took the loss despite a strong outing in chilly, windy conditions. Gonzales struck out four and walked three, giving up just five hits in the seven-inning outing.\n\nGonzales\u2019 only mistake was leaving a 3-2 sinker up in the zone for Laureano, who sent it out of the park in left field for his 24th home run in the third inning.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to one swing and theirs went over the fence,\u201d Mariners manager Scott Servais said.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthletics: OFs Chad Pinder and Ramon Laureano were in the lineup Saturday despite taking spills Friday night in an outfield manager Bob Melvin characterized as difficult to play on due to rain and dampness. Pinder twisted his knee on Friday, Melvin said, \u201cand he has a little abductor thing that he has going on in concert with a hamstring thing he\u2019s got going on.\u201d But Pinder hit in the cage and ran around on the field enough to convince Melvin to put him in the lineup with home-field advantage in the AL wild-card race still in play. Also playing hurt are Laureano (shin), OF Mark Canha (groin) and Robbie Grossman (shoulder).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way this group is,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cThey want to play, they want to win home field. It doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\nMariners: LHP Tommy will miss his bulk innings assignment Sunday because of an inflamed left shoulder, Mariners manager Scott Servais said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAthletics: RHP Tanner Roark (4-2, 4.50 ERA) will make his 10th start for the A\u2019s since coming over from Cincinnati at the trade deadline.\n\nMariners: Prospect RHP Justin Dunn (0-0, 3.86 ERA) will serve as an opener and will be followed by multiple relievers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oakland pitcher Brett Anderson understands the importance of the Athletics hosting the American League wild-card game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Chris Talbott"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/athletics_mariners_baseball_50502_c0-336-4415-2910_s1770x1032.jpg?876498a17a2e40bf60971d03e83a195acfb91a71", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
