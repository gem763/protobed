There are certain things, whether it\u2019s the Minkah trade or Laremy or Kenny or dropping the ball or throwing an interception that some people treat them as taboo, but you have to be open about it and put everything out there and knowing guys are going to make mistakes, but maybe getting to the root of why it\u2019s happening,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI just think as a whole, overcommunicating on all that and getting it out there is an important thing.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s steady nature may have a lot to do with him keeping the starting job, despite leading the team to 10 points in two games. It\u2019s probably inevitable that they\u2019ll let Josh Rosen start (What\u2019s it going to do, get worse? Trick question, it can always get worse), which Fitzpatrick will accept as part of the business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it every way,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI truly have. . . . There\u2019s a million things and ways it\u2019s happened in my career. For me, always being ready and knowing that when I have my opportunity, I have to go out there and do my best.\n\n\u201cMy whole career has been like that. I try to do my best in putting my focus in what I can control. The first two games, there\u2019s a lot of things that I need to do better in order for us to perform better, and that\u2019s where my focus is on right now.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWith so much to work with, not recognizing the obvious won\u2019t help.", "description": "The Dolphins are many things at the moment.
