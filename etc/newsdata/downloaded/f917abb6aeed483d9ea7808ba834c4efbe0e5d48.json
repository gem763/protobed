They were very much real.\n\nFollowing a dramatic day of foul-mouthed tweeting, raging at reporters and awkward moments with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Trump found time to drop a doctored version of Nickelback\u2019s \u201cLook At This Photograph\u201d music video, which had been edited to include an image of Joe Biden and his son alongside two other men:\n\nLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH! pic.twitter.com/QQYTqG4KTt \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nThe video takes a swing at Biden for saying he never spoke with his son about his business dealings in Ukraine and follows up with an image of the father and son golfing with a man labelled as a \u201cUkraine Gas Exec.\u201d\n\nThe gas exec is Devon Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime American business partner. The two were both board members of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.\n\nThe president posted the video in response to the intensifying impeachment inquiry launched against him last week. A whistleblower complaint regarding his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed that Trump asked Zelensky as a \u201cfavor\u201d to investigate his 2020 rival and son based on unfounded corruption allegations relating to Burisma Holdings.\n\nTrump has accused Biden of seeking the removal of a prosecutor in Ukraine when he was Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, supposedly in an attempt to quash an investigation into Burisma Holdings. Trump\u2019s accusation was widely considered to be unfounded; numerous Ukrainian officials and independent media reports said there was no evidence Biden advocated for the prosecutor\u2019s removal with his son\u2019s interests in mind.\n\nPrior to posting the Nickelback tweet, Trump gave a press conference where he grew agitated while repeatedly refusing to answer a reporter\u2019s question about what exactly he wanted to be investigated.\n\nPeople on social media were surprised by the Nickelback tweet for an array of reasons:\n\nThe writers of America have now unquestionably jumped the shark by having a Trump-Nickelback crossover in today's episode.\n\n\n\nIt's time to cancel this show and start from scratch. \u2014 Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) October 2, 2019\n\nthe president is arguing against his impeachment by tweeting Nickelback memes\n\n\n\nwe are living in the shittiest Black Mirror episode of all time https://t.co/5JAsQxZpLl \u2014 Drew Landry (@MrDrewLandry) October 2, 2019\n\nImagine sitting in a coffee shop in 2014 and telling a friend that 5 years from now President Trump will try to buy Greenland, want to turn the border into an Indiana Jones-style snake pit and share Nickelback meme videos.
