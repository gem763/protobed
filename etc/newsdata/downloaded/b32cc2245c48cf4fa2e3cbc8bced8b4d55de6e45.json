Both the US and China said this week they would delay tariffs on some products set to take effect in the coming months.\n\nChina announced a short-list of products would be temporarily exempt from upcoming tariffs, while President Trump reportedly said an increase in duties on Chinese exports would be delayed two weeks until October 15. Both moves were seen as an effort to cool down trade tensions between the countries ahead of scheduled talks.\n\nBut both countries have extended olive branches before, and yet the trade war has raged on. It\u2019s unclear whether a deal will come from upcoming talks, but tons of companies are hoping a resolution will come soon, for the sake of their businesses.\n\nGoldman Sachs put together a list of companies that have the highest exposure to China based on revenue. To that end, they can be considered those with the most riding on a successful trade resolution.\n\nHere are the 12 companies, ranked in increasing order of Chinese exposure:\n\n12.
