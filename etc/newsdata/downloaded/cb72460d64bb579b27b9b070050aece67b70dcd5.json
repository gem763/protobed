Dan\u2019s experience in the sector is unparalleled,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet last week. \u201cA total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!\u201d\n\n\u2026.He is also my friend! At the same time, I am pleased to nominate Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette to be the new Secretary of Energy. Dan\u2019s experience in the sector is unparalleled. A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\nTrump announced late Wednesday night that he will confirm one of his key 2016 presidential campaign promises by withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.\n\nBrouillette said that the country, under Trump, has managed to reduce emissions beyond other Paris treaty signatories while growing the American economy.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single signatory to that accord that has come close to the United States\u2019 record on the environment,\u201d Brouillette said. \u201cNot a single signatory.\u201d\n\nFurther, he said that while America has continued to reduce carbon emissions, China has continued to pollute the world.\n\nThe energy deputy secretary said, \u201cAll of the gains that we have made are offset exponentially by the Chinese. It shows the fallacy of an agreement of the Paris Accords. We have reduced our energy-related emissions by 14 percent. That has been offset exponentially by the Chinese in probably a month or maybe a month and a half. They are making near-zero progress regarding these types of issues.\u201d\n\nThe energy secretary nominee then noted that America\u2019s growing Marcellus Shale natural gas developments have \u201cfundamentally transformed the entire Appalachian region. If you were to hold that out as a country, it would be one of the largest energy-producing countries in the world. Appalachia alone.\u201d\n\nBrouillette said that Trump \u201cis committed to developing infrastructure that would move\u201d American energy to the market. However, many states, such as New York, have refused natural gas pipelines to areas such as Boston, Massachusetts. New York\u2019s blocking of pipelines has led to a Russian oil tanker selling natural gas to Boston instead of Pennsylvania shale natural gas.\n\n\u201cWe had a Russian tanker parked in Boston harbor, selling Russian gas to American consumers because we couldn\u2019t get the gas to consumers through to New York to Boston,\u201d he said. \u201d That\u2019s an outrageous development.\u201d\n\nBrouillette also touted nuclear reactors, given that they emit \u201czero emissions.\u201d He said that the industry is developing low-enriched uranium that is \u201cwalkaway safe.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cThe fuel is \u2018walk-away safe.\u2019 It can\u2019t melt down. You can\u2019t have an accident. If the cooling system shuts off, you can walk away from it, and nothing happens. It fundamentally changes nuclear energy going forward.\u201d\n\nBrouillette chided the progressive Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal, saying that it would \u201cdictate to the American economy what types of jobs, what types of industries survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not something the government is very good at. It\u2019s something that American people are very good at,\u201d he said.\n\nThe energy deputy secretary said that Americans can solve the country\u2019s pollution problems.\n\n\u201cThe ingenuity that Americans bring to anything they do is just incredible,\u201d he said.", "description": "Energy Department Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette said that Chinese pollution has \"offset\" American gains to reduce pollution in one month.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Dan-Brouillette-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
