The invitation-only events bring the individuals together at a Philharmonic rehearsal and give them a look at how a symphonic program is planned and prepared.\n\nThe expectation is that the influencers, who are mostly in their 20s and 30s, will share the experience with their similarly aged followers. The Philharmonic is especially courting influencers from outside the classical scene, including individuals connected to the fashion and lifestyle realm.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to woo a social media-obsessed millennial market that has been a difficult draw for classical-music groups, who tend to appeal to a graying demographic.\n\nAt the Philharmonic, attendees who are 34 years or younger constitute just 19% of the orchestra\u2019s ticket buyers, officials said.\n\n\u201cTo create buzz, you need to go to nontraditional audiences,\u201d said Deborah Borda, the orchestra\u2019s president and chief executive.\n\nOther efforts to reach younger audiences include discounted ticketing and inventive Nightcap concerts that start as late as 10:30 p.m. The orchestra is also featuring work by the Icelandic pop sensation Bj\u00f6rk on one of its programs this season.\n\nBut Ms. Borda said the social-media and influencer component is key to the strategy.\n\n\u201cFor an orchestra to be in the 21st Century, we have to expand our digital footprint,\u201d she said.\n\nThe arts community has lagged behind much of the consumer world, including dining establishments, in reaching out to influencers, said Danielle Wiley, CEO of the Sway Group, an influencer marketing agency based in the San Francisco area. Still, Ms. Wiley said it is better late than never for an orchestra to go this route, especially with insider opportunities that influencers covet, such as a closed-door rehearsal.\n\n\u201cIt makes a ton of sense,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Philharmonic builds on that behind-the-scenes idea by often giving the influencers a chance to meet with musicians or other individuals connected to a program. The orchestra also makes sure to invite influencers who are known outside the classical realm in an effort to further broaden the orchestra\u2019s reach.\n\nA case in point: Last season, the Philharmonic welcomed Samantha Angelo, a musician-turned-fashion stylist, creative director and designer who has nearly 150,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nMs. Angelo said one of the best parts of her visit to the orchestra during a rehearsal of Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah\u201d was the chance to see the Philharmonic\u2019s library and even one of the batons of Leonard Bernstein, its celebrated former music director.\n\n\u201cIt was the coolest thing,\u201d she said, adding that she readily shared the experience on social media.\n\nThe Philharmonic isn\u2019t necessarily the first orchestra to go the influencer route. Jesse Rosen, president and CEO of the League of American Orchestras, an industry trade group, said he is aware of a few others across the country. Most notably, the Cleveland Orchestra regularly invites influencers to concerts.\n\nMr. Rosen also expects more to follow. \u201cIt\u2019s acknowledging that the channels we have to reach people have changed,\u201d he said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you make the philharmonic attractive to a younger generation?
