Riley say.\n\nThough companies are taking precautions to defend themselves against the biggest difficulties possible from the trade war, the chance for hiccups in the not-so-distant future is still present.\n\n\u201cElectronics tend to be a little quicker, so we might see a little disruption around Super Bowl for TVs,\u201d Ryan Mulcunry, executive vice president of Great American Group, a B. Riley Financial Inc. RILY, -0.95% company, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the earliest we would see massive disruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome may see disruption for the spring line apparel.\u201d\n\nExperts say the 2019 holiday season is safe, with much of the merchandise that shoppers will be gifting already in the U.S.\n\n\u201cShipments of toys normally reach a maximum in October while phones peak in October or November; and laptops peak in November or December,\u201d according to an August report from Panjiva, a part of S&P Global Market Intelligence that provides data on the global supply chain.\n\nWatch: How to know which retailers will take the biggest hit from a trade war\n\nIn August, President Trump announced that tariffs on items like iPhones and toys would be delayed until Dec. 15 in order to keep from interrupting the holiday shopping season. But postholiday purchases could be in peril.\n\nOne step many brands and retailers are taking is moving some portion of their manufacturing out of China to avoid steep tariffs. Countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh have become important secondary hubs for this purpose.\n\nAnd while Mulcunry thinks the countries can manage a chunk of the demand, there are some things that could be a challenge.\n\n\u201cIt depends on how complex the manufacturing process is,\u201d he said. The cutting and sewing necessary for socks is simple, but custom furniture, auto parts, and other more complex items could be trickier.\n\nSee: Trade war could cost global economy $700 billion by 2020, new IMF chief says\n\nMulcunry said margins are on their minds, and the minds of corporate executives, as the trade war drags on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tracking margins closely over the next six months,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the number one thing we\u2019re looking for in quarterly earnings and estimates.\u201d\n\nMany companies are hedging their trade risk, says Jonathan Treiber, chief executive of RevTrax, a platform that manages special offers and discounts.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental reality is China is still the lowest cost manufacturer,\u201d he said. \u201cVietnam and Bangladesh are viable, but I\u2019m hearing those countries don\u2019t have the operational scale for manufacturing that China does. The question is whether these countries can be a yearlong stopgap or take a portion of the volume or certain types of products.\u201d\n\nBased on the political pressure surrounding trade, Treiber said there\u2019s a good chance the current situation is a short-term one.\n\nRead: Latest tariff hikes kick in, and U.S. consumers will likely see higher prices\n\nOne category with a plan in the event of a steep price increase is consumer packaged goods, which, Treiber said, has a history of providing more promotions and incentives in order to soften the blow for price-sensitive shoppers. Examples of consumer packaged goods companies include Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -1.55% and Kimberly-Clark Corp. KMB, -2.18% .\n\n\u201cA key tactic is increasing promotional spending through discounting and coupons,\u201d Treiber said. \u201cConsumers who can absorb the price increase will. Companies will coordinate a price increase and then flood discounts for those who are price sensitive.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, -1.56% has rallied 16.2% for the year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.19% has gained 12.8%, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -1.45% has inched up 0.3% and the Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF PBJ, -0.94% is up 16.4%.", "description": "Analysts say the holiday season is safe, but the Super Bowl in February could be when we see the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on store shelves.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS892_tv_foo_ZG_20191008150825.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
