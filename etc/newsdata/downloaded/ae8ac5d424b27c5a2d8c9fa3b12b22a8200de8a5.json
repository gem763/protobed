The government says the protests were a plot to topple President Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister at the time.\n\nThe indictment says Kavala had discussed bringing milk, juice and pastries to Gezi, as well as gasmasks to counter the effects of tear gas, which showed he was financing the protests.\n\nAsked in court about the evidence, Kavala said he had bought pastries and some doctor\u2019s masks for the protests, but \u201cbelieved that these masks would be used by the young people in the park for peaceful goals\u201d.\n\n\u201cDuring the Gezi protests, the tear gas from around the area was also affecting Gezi Park,\u201d he said.\n\nKavala, a prominent businessman and civil rights figure who has been active in liberal causes, sat on the board at the time of the Turkish branch of financier George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. He said the charity had not provided any financial support to the protests.\n\nThe court set Dec. 24-25 as the date for the next hearing in the case and remanded Kavala to jail during the trial. The trial began in June against a backdrop of concern about growing authoritarianism in Turkey, where tens of thousands have been arrested in a crackdown on dissent since a failed military coup targeting Erdogan in 2016.\n\nThe Gezi demonstrations in the summer of 2013 started as a protest against the redevelopment of a park in Istanbul, a city with limited green space, and quickly spread across the country.\n\nErdogan says the environmental protests were cover for an attempt to dislodge the government from power.", "description": "A Turkish businessman and activist, whose trial over accusations he tried to overthrow the government has been criticised by Western countries, denied on Tuesday he had funded and organised the protests six years ago.", "authors": ["Ali Kucukgocmen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
