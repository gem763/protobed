Parker Song/Pool via REUTERS\n\n\u201cThe possibility of a visit of the prime minister to Saudi Arabia and Iran is on the cards and I will update you as things unfold,\u201d foreign office spokesman, Mohammad Fasisal, told a news briefing.\n\nThe announcement of the possible visit comes after Khan last month described a request by U.S. President Donald Trump, asking the Pakistani leader to help defuse tensions with Iran. Washington had blamed Tehran for an attack on the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia.\n\nFaisal declined to comment when asked whether the visit was related to the mediation request.\n\nTensions have elevated between Iran and Saudi Arabia since the attack, which took place on Sept. 14.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility, but Washington and Riyadh say they believe the attack came from the opposite direction and blame Iran. Iran denies involvement.\n\nKhan said after a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York that he was \u201ctrying and mediating\u201d and had also spoken with Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nKhan has ramped up his government\u2019s engagement on the international stage, offering to negotiate regional tensions. He has separately proposed to Trump that Pakistan could help broker peace in neighbouring Afghanistan.\n\nLast week Pakistani government ministers met with both Taliban representatives and the U.S. peace envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, in Islamabad while Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister called for a resumption in stalled peace talks between the Taliban and Washington.\n\nThe Taliban also met with Khalilzad, sources told Reuters, the first known contact since Trump halted talks last month, though officials said the talks did not represent a formal resumption of negotiations.", "description": "Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan is likely to visit Saudi Arabia and Iran, the foreign office in Islamabad said on Thursday, weeks after Islamabad said Washington had asked it to mediate with Tehran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439237678&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990XJ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
