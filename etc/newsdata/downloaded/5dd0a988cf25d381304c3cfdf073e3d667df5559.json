Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe President is calling on you at this critical time to remind AOC and Democrats that this is our country, not theirs.\u201d This is the message that Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign conveyed to its supporters in a fundraising email on Tuesday. And it is one that the mainstream press should take both seriously and literally.\n\nIn high-profile speeches throughout his first years in office, Trump insisted that his brand of nationalism was color-blind and all-inclusive. Far from being a force for division, a politics that prioritizes the interests of citizens above domestic aliens and foreign publics would help Americans \u201crediscover our loyalty to each other,\u201d Trump argued in his inaugural address, because \u201cwhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\u201d The president was a \u201cuniter\u201d not a divider.\n\nThe commander-in-chief has now dispensed with such pretenses. In his campaign\u2019s view, this country belongs exclusively to his supporters; Democrats have no interests that the Trump administration is bound to respect. It would be scandalous enough for a president\u2019s campaign to promote this sentiment disingenuously, as a cynical means of firing up its base. But Trump\u2019s contempt for his majoritarian opposition is entirely earnest. His campaign\u2019s email does not articulate a demagogic reelection strategy so much as an authoritarian governing philosophy. We are not looking at a presidential scandal, but the makings of democratic crisis.\n\nThe teleprompted bromides in his national addresses notwithstanding, Trump has always governed as though Republicans were his only legitimate constituents. Even before he assumed office, the president-elect dismissed Hillary Clinton\u2019s ostensible popular-vote majority as a fiction, insisting that millions of Democratic voters were, in fact, ballot-stuffing, undocumented immigrants. As president, Trump has shown a singular disinterest in appealing to \u2014 or showing even the smallest bit of deference to the interests of \u2014 those outside his party\u2019s coalition. In both public statements and private meetings, Trump has indicated that he is far less concerned with promoting the interests of America as a whole than those of his base. When Trump was, in his own words, \u201creally ready and psyched to terminate NAFTA\u201d in 2017, macroeconomic projections suggesting the policy would hurt the median American did not persuade the president to change course. Rather, pro-trade White House advisers changed Trump\u2019s mind by showing him a map that indicated the regions most vulnerable to NAFTA\u2019s cancellation were also strongly Republican. \u201cIt shows that I do have a very big farmer base, which is good,\u201d Trump told Reuters of his advisers\u2019 presentation. \u201cThey like Trump, but I like them, and I\u2019m going to help them.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cchampagne for real Americans, and real pain for sham Americans\u201d approach to governance informed the structure of the Trump tax cuts (which targeted deductions beloved by blue-state residents), the distribution of hurricane aid, Trump\u2019s call for police officers to brutalize criminal suspects, his pardon of Joe Arpaio, and perennial negotiating \u201cstrategy\u201d of using state power to deliberately harm Democratic constituencies in order to bully the opposition into unilateral concessions.\n\nCataloguing all the ways ways Trump has tacitly affirmed \u201cthis is our country, not theirs\u201d through rhetoric would take days. But his decision to spend the final weeks of the midterm campaign accusing the Democratic Party of organizing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of the United States \u2014 as part of a nefarious plot to rig the elections, and thus, make it impossible for real Americans to reclaim their government through democratic means \u2014 was exemplary in its toxicity.\n\nBut the sincerity of the Trump campaign\u2019s message in its fundraising email may be most vividly illustrated by two developments from the past 24 hours. First, consider the president\u2019s recent (tweeted) remarks on the hurricane that was then threatening the well-being of more than 3 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico:\n\nWow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for \u201canywhere.\u201d\n\nWe are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!\n\nPuerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!\u2026And by the way, I\u2019m the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Puerto Rico!\n\nThis is not how a president who viewed Puerto Ricans as his constituents (or as equal members of the American nation) would discuss the possibility that an island that lost 3,000 lives to a storm just two years might soon suffer a similar tragedy. In his first tweet, Trump makes clear that \u201cwill it ever end\u201d is meant to express the irritation that conservative, mainland Americans might feel at being on the hook for Puerto Rico\u2019s woes: Another natural disaster on the island is not exasperating because the last one killed roughly as many American citizens as the 9/11 attacks, but rather, because Hurricane Maria cost American taxpayers \u201c92 Billion Dollars.\u201d\n\nTrump clarifies this point in subsequent tweets, in which he not only condemns the corruption and profligacy of a local government that is currently in a state of emergency, but also appears to hold Puerto Ricans personally responsible for the prevalence of hurricanes in the Caribbean (\u201cas it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico\u201d). Of course, Puerto Rico\u2019s residents did not have the opportunity to vote against Trump in the 2016 election. But the island\u2019s leaders have often been critical of the president, and the islanders\u2019 skin tone sets them apart from the \u201creal American\u201d norm. Thus, the president refers to Puerto Rico\u2019s American citizens as though they were mere wards of the state (and ungrateful, ne\u2019er-do-well wards one would gladly trade for Greenlanders, at that).\n\nThe second, more alarming indication that the American president believes our country belongs exclusively to his supporters comes courtesy of a Washington Post update on the status of Trump\u2019s border wall. Recall that the president declared a state of emergency earlier this year in order to divert funds away from the Pentagon and toward his monument to American xenophobia in defiance of Congress\u2019s will and prerogatives. At the time of Trump\u2019s declaration, many observers suggested his maneuver would have little practical significance: Funding aside, the president\u2019s vision required gaining access to privately owned lands, and that would require winning eminent-domain lawsuits that were sure to drag well past the 2020 election.\n\nBut such pundits failed to consider the possibility that this president feels less bound by the letter of the law than the will of the Volk:\n\nPresident Trump is so eager to complete hundreds of miles of border fence ahead of the 2020 presidential election that he has directed aides to fast-track billions of dollars\u2019 worth of construction contracts, aggressively seize private land and disregard environmental rules, according to current and former officials involved with the project.\n\nThe president has told senior aides that a failure to deliver on the signature promise of his 2016 campaign would be a letdown to his supporters and an embarrassing defeat \u2026 When aides have suggested that some orders are illegal or unworkable, Trump has suggested he would pardon the officials if they would just go ahead, aides said. He has waved off worries about contracting procedures and the use of eminent domain, saying \u201ctake the land,\u201d according to officials who attended the meetings.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pardon you,\u201d he has told officials in meetings about the wall.\n\nTrump denies having offered such pardons. But there is no basis for giving him the benefit of the doubt on this subject. This is not the first time that administration officials have told reporters that the president tried to persuade them to follow an illegal order by promising to immunize them from prosecution.\n\nTrump can prioritize the will of the Fox News faithful above the spirit of the law, thanks to egregious flaws in our Constitution\u2019s design. The pardon power, the two-thirds threshold for impeachment, and the Justice Department policy against criminally indicting a sitting president have conspired to make a mockery of our republic\u2019s supposed \u201cchecks and balances.\u201d It now takes 60 Senate votes to amend a single regulation, but just 34 to give the president effective immunity from federal law.\n\nBut if our archaic Constitution makes Trump\u2019s fence construction possible, it is the principle articulated in his campaign\u2019s email that makes such actions legitimate: This is the Republican base\u2019s country, not ours \u2014 and so their wall trumps our laws.\n\nWhen applied to a disagreement over how many feet of fencing to build in a desert, the president\u2019s (now explicit) governing philosophy may seem mostly innocuous. If it is ever applied to the results of a closely contested 2020 election, however, it won\u2019t seem that way at all.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s callous tweets about Puerto Rico and Hurricane Dorian, and his lawless attempt to build his border wall on stolen land, are informed by the same principle: This country belongs exclusively to the Republican base.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/28/28-trump-wall.w1200.h630.jpg"}
