Previous research has shown that six-month-old babies are capable of telling the difference between friend and foe, suggesting we are born with a moral code. While another study found that babies may come into the world with brains capable of daydreaming and introspection. Studies also show that by the tender age of ten months, youngsters are aware of the \u2018law of the jungle\u2019 - that size brings with it power.\n\nPrevious research has shown that the process of counting begins at around two-and-a-half years old, when youngsters begin to recite the count list but do not yet know what the count words mean.\n\nAt about the age of four, children begin to understand the cardinal principle - which is a connection between numbers as words and a quantity of items.\n\nThe researchers recruited 80 toddlers, aged between 13 and 20 months, as part of the experimental study.\n\nThe team performed five tests, all of which involved hiding toys - either dogs or cars - inside an opaque box.\n\nIn some instances, the researchers counted each toy aloud before putting them into boxes, while in other scenarios they simply dropped the toys into the box one by one in full view of the toddlers.\n\nThe children tended to lose interest when the toys were not counted before being hidden.\n\nToddlers who hear objects being counted are able to associate the number words with the corresponding quantities\n\nBut when the researchers counted the toys, the toddlers were better at remembering the number of toys and continued to look in the box to try to find them all.\n\nJenny Wang, a former graduate student at Johns Hopkins and one of the study authors, said: 'These results were actually really surprising because all the prior research of the past decade has shown how difficult it is for children to master the meaning of count words.'\n\nShe added: 'Our results are the first to show that very young infants have a sense that, when other people are counting, it is tied to the rough dimension of quantity in the world.'", "description": "Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, in Maryland, found that toddlers who hear objects being counted are able to associate the number words with the corresponding quantities.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20127012-0-image-a-12_1571913690676.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
