(Justice Ward said she found argument on this front \"unedifying\".)\n\n\"Not only may the most experienced not be the most capable, but the criteria for the assessment of capability may be highly subjective and the evaluation of capability quite problematic,'' he said.\n\n\"The whole process would not only be invidious for the court but also, in my opinion, it would take the court to territory into which it is inappropriate for it to travel.\"", "description": "An AMP class action appeal finds there is no first-mover advantage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/12614dd9cadfd5a93e9d6a9cb792f5cbd06ef514", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
