Shares in M&G MNG.L , the UK business spun off by insurer\n\nPrudential , fell 11% in a rocky start to trading as a standalone\n\nbusiness. Prudential lost 10%.\n\nAmong midcaps, Capital & Counties Properties\n\njumped 8.2% after luxury property developer Nicholas Candy's\n\ninvestment arm said it was in early talks for a possible cash\n\noffer for the property manager.\n\nIndustrial fastener maker Trifast plunged 15% on\n\nthe UK small-cap index after forecasting lower earnings for the\n\nyear, while peer-to-peer lending platform Funding Circle\n\nadvanced 7% after reporting strong loan growth.
