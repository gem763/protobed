But I pay for lunch at work, and I pay for my Netflix NFLX, +0.22% account.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s got plenty of company.\n\nRoughly half of millennials and Generation Z expect to be financially reliant on their parents in their early 20s.\n\nDespite a decade-long expansion and record-low unemployment, studies suggest that between 60% and 70% of 18- to 34-year-olds rely on their parents for financial assistance.\n\nBut most young Americans don\u2019t agree with Kristine\u2019s confessed embarrassment, according to a recent study released by TD Ameritrade AMTD, +2.67%. (Parents had a slightly different opinion.)\n\nThough roughly half of younger millennials and Generation Z members expect to be financially independent in their early 20s, according to the new study, and over 90% of parents surveyed expect their kids to be financially independent by the age of 25, previous research suggests those are optimistic goals.\n\nParticipants in the TD Ameritrade online survey of more than 3,000 people conducted by Harris were grouped into three categories: Generation Z (ages 15 to 21), young millennials (ages 22 to 28) and parents (ages 30 to 60).\n\nSome 63% of millennials say their mom and dad are their best friends, and 77% of parents feel the same way.\n\nFor all those groups, reality can be the enemy of aspiration. Kristine aimed to move out of her parents\u2019 place, located within a 30-minute commute of New York City, by 25, but lost her job. She began freelancing, and paying a New York rent without a dependable paycheck did not seem possible without some assistance. She now has a steady job, but \u201cit\u2019s an hourly wage, and it\u2019s much less than what I was making in the job I had when I was 22,\u201d she said.\n\nFor millennials who are financially reliant on their parents and/or still live with them, there doesn\u2019t appear to be much associated shame, and, fortunately, the TD Ameritrade survey found, both parties regard each other as friends,with 63% of the millennials saying their mom and dad are their best friends, and 77% of parents feeling the same way.\n\nRoughly 15% of millennials live with their parents, up from 10% of Generation X members when they were in their 20s and 30s, the Pew Research Center found.\n\n\u201cAt 30,\u201d said Kristine, \u201cI should probably figure it out.\u201d Until then, living with her parents has allowed her to save some money and do the work she wants to do. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with my parents about the privilege of being able to pursue a career in journalism,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something I would be able to do if my parents didn\u2019t live near the city and I couldn\u2019t live with them.\u201d\n\nStudent loans and rising rents don\u2019t help\n\nYoung people living off their parents\u2019 generosity in decades past may have been seen as freeloaders. But today, parental help is seen more as a financial imperative.\n\n\u201cFinancial help from your parents is an economic necessity for this generation,\u201d Lindsey Pollak, author of \u201cThe Remix: How to Lead and Succeed in the Multigenerational Workplace,\u201d told MarketWatch. \u201cThis generation has been faced with the highest level of student-loan debt in history.\u201d\n\n\u2018Financial help from your parents is an economic necessity for this generation. It\u2019s unfair to compare a 30-year-old today to one 30 years ago.\u2019 Lindsey Pollak, author\n\nOver 40 million borrowers collectively owe about $1.5 trillion in student debt. This is up from $600 million a decade ago. One in six of these borrowers has debt that\u2019s greater than his or her annual income, and the average borrower owes almost $30,000 upon college graduation.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the case three decades ago, Pollak said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to compare a 30-year-old today to one 30 years ago,\u201d she added. In the past 10 years alone, the number of borrowers who owe more than $100,000 has quadrupled.\n\nFor the most part, meanwhile, the U.S. economy is doing well. It\u2019s been growing for a record stretch of 121 months, or more than a decade, and the unemployment rate recently hit its lowest point since 1969 at 3.7%. Despite these improvements, wages aren\u2019t moving much \u2014 at least, not in the right direction. Real wages have effectively declined by 0.8% in the past year, according to the PayScale Index.\n\nRent increases are outpacing wage increases. In San Francisco, the median monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,690, according to Zumper. In New York City, it\u2019s $2,870.\n\nIn San Francisco, the median monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,690. In New York City, it\u2019s $2,870.\n\nWhile narrow majorities of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents predicted they\u2019d ultimately fare better financially than their parents have, Jason Kirsch, the author of \u201cThe Millennial Advantage\u201d and the president of Grow, a financial-planning company for millennials, advises all of his clients to try to get as much money from their parents as possible. \u201cEven if they have a good job, the best possible financial decision they can make is asking their parents for money, either as a gift or as a loan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Parents could end up as an enabler\u2019\n\nIt can be taken too far, he conceded. \u201cMost professional motivation for our generation is purpose-driven,\u201d Kirsch said. \u201cSo even if kids are getting money from their parents, they are still likely to be motivated at work.\u201d He adds one caveat: \u201cParents could end up as an enabler if they are giving too much money.\u201d\n\nChristine Russell, a senior manager of retirement and annuities at TD Ameritrade, also said there was a possibility of giving kids too much money. \u201cAre you borrowing from your parents to fund a lifestyle that you haven\u2019t earned yet?\u201d she asked.\n\nFailure to launch can take a toll on young people\u2019s self-esteem. \u201cMy parents aren\u2019t pushing me out the door. There\u2019s even the question of would they want me to be alone in the city,\u201d Kristine told MarketWatch. But she says she\u2019s \u201cnot fine\u201d with her current situation, \u201cand it is frustrating.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to have something that I have earned,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I was paying my parents\u2019 phone bill and cable \u2014 not the other way around \u2014 but that just isn\u2019t the case right now.\u201d", "description": "Why it\u2019s time to cut millennials some slack for being financially dependent on their parents.", "authors": ["James Wellemeyer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN396_Family_ZG_20190716092517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-16"}
