It did not say when it might make a second attempt.\n\nExecutives are also said to be contemplating job cuts and other ways to cut costs.\n\nTroubled flotations\n\nThe collapse of WeWork's flotation plan comes as other high-profile companies making their stock market debuts this year have run into trouble.\n\nShares in Uber, which went public in May, are now trading around $30 apiece, down by roughly a third.\n\nShares in Lyft, which went public in March, are down by almost half.", "description": "The troubled office rental firm drops its stock market listing less than a week after its boss resigned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15F66/production/_106785998_wepool.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
