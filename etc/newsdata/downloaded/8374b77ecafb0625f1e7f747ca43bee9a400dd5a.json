He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nMs. Curtis, a critic of Mr. Trump, reacted to the president\u2019s speech on Twitter, suggesting that al-Baghdadi was \u201cblown up\u201d and that he suffered like \u201call living things\u201d do, including dogs.\n\n\u201cHe may have died a coward @realDonaldTrump but ALL living things suffer when they are blown up,\u201d the actress wrote. \u201cAnyone who has experienced warfare, unlike yourself, would know that. War is brutal. Dogs are brave, bold, loyal, loving and healing.\u201d\n\nThe tweet racked up thousands of comments slamming Ms. Curtis for seemingly sympathizing with the slain terrorist. She deleted the tweet while this story was being written and replaced it with a post praising the military and her local law enforcement.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
