They suspect it connected Siloam Pool, a spot where pilgrims could bathe and get fresh water, to the Temple Mount, a sacred place of worship within Jerusalem\u2019s inner \u201cCity of David,\u201d Live Science reports. The complex and artfully detailed design of the road suggests it was an important thoroughfare between the two spots.\n\nOver the course of six years, scientists from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University excavated the site and found over 100 coins beneath the road dating between 17 AD and 31 AD. This means the street would have been constructed during or after 31 AD, likely during Pontius Pilate\u2019s rule. At the time, Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea, and is best known for presiding over the trial and execution of Christ.\n\n\n\nThe study authors offer further proof that the road was built during this time: The most common coins found in archaeological excavations in Jerusalem are coins that were minted in 41 AD. Their omission from this street\u2019s excavation site means it was probably constructed within the span of 10 years prior.\n\nScientists have known about the road since British archaeologists discovered it in 1894, but they've only recently narrowed down the timeframe during which it was constructed, according to The Independent . Excavations reveal the street was covered in rubble, which was likely deposited in 71 AD, when Romans took over the city.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Pontius Pilate likely commissioned the street during or after 31 AD.", "authors": ["Jennifer Leman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HS_Z6zORd7SneeMhEgwU2w--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/9fca234df8c3a9b611dbb96873b4bd90", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
