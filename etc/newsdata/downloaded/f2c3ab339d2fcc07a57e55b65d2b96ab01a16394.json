The average price of his trees is $115.\n\nIt's a lucrative business, Walsh says. He has opened six locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens transforming parks and beer gardens into winter wonderlands with wreath-making stations, lights and Christmas ornaments. He sells around 5,000 Christmas trees a year.\n\n\u201cA well-run tree stand can make $10,000 to $20,000,\u201d Walsh says, adding that he has made upwards of $100,000 a year running his own business.\n\nOther small businesses have also cashed in on Christmas, too. Anne Marie Blackman, a former stay-at-home mom, had the idea of selling ugly Christmas sweaters in 2008. Since then, her company My Ugly Christmas Sweater, has reportedly sold more than 25,000 of of the garments and raked in more than a million dollars in revenue.\n\nAnd last year, Amazon said it would start shipping fresh, full-size Christmas trees, including Douglas firs and Norfolk Island pines for $115.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The small business of buying and selling Christmas trees turned into a lucrative six-figure gig for this entrepreneur.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/small-biz-1280.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
