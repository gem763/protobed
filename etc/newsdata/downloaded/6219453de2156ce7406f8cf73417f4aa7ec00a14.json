(Bernat Armangue/AP)\n\nThe hardcore supporters of Jerusalem\u2019s Beitar soccer club are proud their team has never signed an Arab Muslim player and once boycotted its games when a pair of Muslim players were briefly imported from Chechnya. These fans, who go by the name La Familia and lead the stadium in thunderous chants of \u201cWar,\u201d have become the most notorious in Israeli soccer.\n\nBut in a striking move, a Tel Aviv tech magnate who bought the team last year is taking on La Familia. Moshe Hogeg has pledged to rid the fan base of racism and nativism \u2014 even having his lawyers send fans letters threatening lawsuits \u2014 and signed an African player named Ali Mohamed. La Familia read that as a challenge, though Mohamed is actually Christian.\n\nHogeg\u2019s effort to remake Beitar Jerusalem and reform its fans has become a flash point in Israel\u2019s class wars, which pit an old-line working class against the nouveau riche.\n\nIsrael\u2019s elections last week revealed a country that is fiercely polarized, divided between religious and secular, hawkish and moderate. But in many ways, it is the schism between the working class, so loyal to longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Beitar Jerusalem, and the liberal elite that spurns both of them that has left Israeli politics so desperately deadlocked.\n\nThe question now is whether Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and its rival Blue and White party will find a way to reach across the divide and perhaps form a unity government.\n\nThe fault line is one of both class and culture. Critics of La Familia may call it nativist and racist, but its members say they\u2019re simply standard-bearers for a working-class Israel that more affluent Israelis doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cMoshe Hogeg thinks he can come in and tell us how to live our lives, like he knows better than us because he makes more money,\u201d Mati Suleimani, 18, a member of La Familia, said outside the stadium during the team\u2019s home opener in late August against Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva. \u201cAnd he is mistaken.\u201d\n\nInside the packed stadium, as the game was about to begin, the fans took their cue from La Familia, singing a decibel-shattering rendition of the Israeli national anthem, Hatikvah , before eventually turning to their signature \u201cWar\u201d chant and a storm of unprintable prostitution-related epithets directed at the opponents.\n\nLa Familia sets the tone for a proudly right-wing team that was founded in 1936, more than a decade before the state of Israel. The team was part of Zeev Jabotinsky\u2019s Beitar movement \u2014 the \u201cRevisionist Zionist\u201d philosophy combining the idea of a Jewish homeland with nationalist politics \u2014 and rivaled the Zionist movement headed by Israel\u2019s founding father David Ben-Gurion.\n\n\n\nBurned trophies in the offices of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team after they were set on fire in February 2013. (Bernat Armangue/AP)\n\nThroughout its history, Beitar Jerusalem has remained closely associated with Revisionist Zionism, which later gave birth to Menachem Begin\u2019s Likud movement. Recent fans have included Netanyahu himself and Avigdor Liberman, a hawkish former defense minister.\n\nBeitar draws heavily from a segment of Israelis who feel increasingly left behind.\n\nThe Israeli economy has been strong in recent years, driven by a tech boom. Companies like Waze, Mobileye and Hogeg\u2019s blockchain firm Sirin Labs and social platform Mobli have turned Israel into a \u201cstart-up nation\u201d with the most new ventures per capita in the world.\n\nThat boom, however, has largely involved and benefited educated Israelis, typically in cosmopolitan Tel Aviv. Israel still has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the developed world, ranking 27 out of 37 countries measured by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2018.\n\n\u201cOnly about nine percent of Israelis work in the tech industry, but that nine percent generates a lot of the wealth,\u201d said Noga Dagan-Buzaglo, executive director of the Adva Center, a Tel Aviv-based think tank that studies social issues. \u201cThat is making the country more divided. I think what you\u2019re seeing with Beitar is the result of those divisions.\u201d\n\nThough the class gap is relatively modern, Beitar has long provided a refuge for the disenfranchised, often Jews of North African and Middle Eastern background, said Yair Galily, who runs the Sport, Media and Society Research Lab at the country\u2019s Sammy Ofer School of Communications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the team of the poor and misfortunate who came to the country 70 and 80 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fans today hold on to that image psychologically.\u201d\n\nFor Hogeg, it\u2019s time for a change. After sending threatening letters to seven fans and suing two for damages, he said he revoked all their season tickets and barred La Familia from selling its merchandise inside the stadium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle,\u201d he admitted in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s just too important not to fight.\u201d\n\nHogeg, 38, takes issue with his portrayal as a high-handed mogul. He said he comes from a working-class family, and his father was a government employee. Ten years ago, Hogeg said, he didn\u2019t have any money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be La Familia\u2019s father,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I need to support them.\u201d He noted that team sponsors that had abandoned the team because of its reputation have slowly begun to return.\n\nHogeg added that he was not trying to change the political character of the team. \u201cYou can be right-wing and Likud. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to be racist,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Beitar remains the only team in the top Israeli division never to sign an Arab Muslim player.\n\nPerhaps to force the issue, Hogeg in June signed Mohamed, a 23-year-old midfielder from Niger. His signing prompted an initial retort on La Familia\u2019s 38,000 -follower Facebook page that the group would \u201cchange\u201d Mohamed\u2019s Muslim-sounding name. The posting did not explain how that would be done.\n\nAt the stadium, many fans said they didn\u2019t care about Mohamed\u2019s name, while others said they approved of the signing only after they realized it could bring victory.\n\n\u201cThe name did bother me, to be honest,\u201d said Yitzhak Levy, 38, who works at a car dealership. \u201cBut when you see a player who is this good, you have to accept it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeitar fans cheer on their team before its UEFA Europa League playoff football match against AS Saint-Etienne at Teddy Stadium on Aug. 17, 2016. (AHMAD GHARABLI/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSome fans said they\u2019d accept an Arab Muslim on the team, but only under certain circumstances. \u201cI would want it only if it was done for football reasons, not to stir things up,\u201d said Aviv Bentolila, 21, who works as a livery driver, standing among many clad in the team\u2019s yellow-and-black colors outside the 30,000-seat Teddy Stadium, ironically named for Jerusalem\u2019s former socialist mayor Teddy Kollek.\n\nOnly a few fans said they would be unequivocally fine with an Arab Muslim.\n\nBut nearly all fans agreed on this: They were glad to see Hogeg spending money on players and are hopeful he can return the team to its championship perch. It hasn\u2019t won a title since 2008.\n\nAnd every single fan interviewed also agreed on their support for right-wing politicians. \u201cBeitar is Likud and Likud is Beitar,\u201d said Amram Temstat, 56, who works in special education.\n\nThe dominant role of ideology at Beitar has made the team an anomaly in international soccer.\n\n\u201cBeitar is really the last political club in Israel, and one of the last anywhere in the European system it\u2019s modeled after,\u201d Galily said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last place where soccer is not completely a commodity \u2014 where the fans believe the club belongs to them and the owner is just a guest. The question is whether Hogeg can change that.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear who will prevail in the stare-down between owner and fans. How far will Hogeg go to rid Beitar of racism? And if he does succeed in changing the culture, will La Familia abandon the team?\n\nSoccer experts remain skeptical about the owner\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say this will have a racism-free ending, but I think it\u2019s more likely La Familia wins and Hogeg leaves defeated,\u201d said Gal Karpel, manager of the progressive New Israel Fund\u2019s Kick Racism Out of Israeli Football initiative. Karpel did note the group found no explicitly anti-Arab chants at the stadium last year after counting 35 instances in 2016-2017.\n\nAt least for the time being, Hogeg is trying to send a new message. He\u2019s had a new slogan, drawn from the Bible, embroidered onto home and away uniforms as well as other merchandise: \u201cLove your neighbor like yourself.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nNetanyahu offers talks over unity government.
