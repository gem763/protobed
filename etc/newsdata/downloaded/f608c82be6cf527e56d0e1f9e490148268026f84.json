It came just as US Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2013 currently on a visit to Ankara \u2013 were breaking the same news to journalists there.\n\nWhile saying that the Turkish Army would indeed stop a further incursion and let the Kurdish YPG militias \u2013 which Ankara calls a \u2018terrorist organization\u2019 \u2013 leave the \u2018safe zone\u2019, Cavusolgu still refused to call it a ceasefire. Such a thing is only possible between \u201ctwo legitimate sides,\u201d he told the local media.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkey to halt military operation against Kurds in N. Syria, ceasefire will last for 120 hours\n\nHe also said that Turkey intends to pursue its initial strategy and create a 32-kilometer deep \u2018safe zone\u2019 along its border with Syria stretching from the Euphrates River to Syria\u2019s border with Iraq. He added that, under the fresh deal with the US, this zone would be controlled by Turkish troops.\n\nAnother part of the agreement involves the \u201ccollection\u201d of all heavy arms from the YPG (key force of the Kurdish-led SDF) and destruction of their positions in the area. That said, Cavusoglu made it clear that Turkey did not give America any \u201cguarantees\u201d on the fate of such cities as Kobani (liberated in 2015 from Islamic State by the Kurds).\n\nAt the same time, he did mention that Turkey actually plans to discuss the fate of the cities within the \u2018safe zone\u2019 like Manbij at a forthcoming meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, in Sochi.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Tough love\u2019 with Turkey got Syria ceasefire done \u2013 Trump\n\nThe pause to the hostilities was already hailed by President Donald Trump as an \u201camazing outcome.\u201d Doubling down, he claimed that sanctions the US imposed on Ankara over the military operation are \u201cno longer necessary\u201d and would be lifted \u201cvery quickly.\u201d\n\nErdogan launched \u2018Peace Spring\u2019 on October 9, souring Ankara\u2019s relations with Washington, which saw Kurds as allies in a fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). Trump repeatedly threatened Turkey with the destruction of its economy, if it did anything that Washington considers \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\nNow, tensions seem to be easing off a bit as Trump thanked Erdogan for his decision in a tweet and said that the path to the Turkish leader\u2019s visit to the US next month is now open.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "Turkey has confirmed reaching an agreement with the US on temporarily halting its military operation against Kurdish-led militias in northern Syria but refused to call it a \u2018ceasefire\u2019, adding that it will go on with its plans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da8c6c4203027145a27253d.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
