Sentiment fell in August after the U.S. trade fight with China took a turn for the worse and stock markets suffered a temporary setback.\n\nWhat happened: The trade war with China is not the only thing on the minds of Americans. Many are worried about other events outside the U.S. impinging on the economy, such as the chaotic British exit from the European Union known as \u201cBrexit.\n\nNor is the U.S. labor market viewed as having the same strength. Fewer people polled expect incomes to keep rising or unemployment to keep falling.\n\nAs has been the case throughout the Trump presidency, Democrats are more pessimistic and Republicans are more optimistic. The opposite was true during the Obama years.\n\nRead: Democrats back $15 minimum wage to draw 2020 election battle lines\n\nBig picture: The confidence of consumers in the economy has been tested by the ongoing trade fight with China and other signs that U.S. growth is slowing. A potential attempt by Democrats to impeach President Trump is likely to add to the anxiety.\n\nRead: Consumer confidence sinks to 3-month low on trade worries, softer jobs market\n\nThe economy will probably muddle along through the rest of the year until the trade and political disputes are resolved or die down, analysts say.\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cThe overall trends in the Sentiment Index remain quite favorable, but show signs of a slow erosion.,\u201d said Richard Curtin, chief economist of the sentiment survey.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.43% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.24% rose slightly in Friday trades.
