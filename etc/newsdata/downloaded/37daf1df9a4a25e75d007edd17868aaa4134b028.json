But who are they, really? Photo: Fox\n\nFinally, The Masked Singer has returned! Everyone\u2019s favorite bizarre reality-TV singing competition is back with its iconic lineup of C-list panelists (sorry, Ken Jeong!) and D-list talent. The debut season saw everyone from Ricki Lake to Joey Fatone to eventual winner T-Pain as whimsical, pseudo-psychedelic characters singing and hinting their way to ultimate reveal. It was extremely shameless and fun, and now Fox is hoping it\u2019ll be just as shameless and fun all over again.\n\nWho knows, maybe with The Masked Singer\u2019s popularity, we\u2019ll see a celebrity \u201cupgrade\u201d from last year\u2019s masked singers.\n\nI certainly hope not!\n\nI\u2019m back to use my best judgement (and the help of thousands of skimmed YouTube and Twitter comments) to take a stab at who could possibly be under the colorful masks. Unlike our panelists \u2014 who still throw out implausible guesses like Lady Gaga and Adele repeatedly \u2014 I\u2019ll take into consideration a few more crucial clues other than the ones given to us in these tricky packages. For example, who are the most likely type of celebrities to appear on a show like The Masked Singer? Have these people already sung elsewhere, perhaps harboring dreams of starting and/or kickstarting a music career? How about the height differential between our singer and host Nick Cannon (who is six feet tall, says Google)? It\u2019s not as simple as, \u201cThis sounds like Billy Joel, could it be him?\u201d so please \u2014 please \u2014 Jenny McCarthy, leave this to an expert.\n\nWho is the Egg on The Masked Singer?\n\nThe Egg is figure skater Johnny Weir. Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the Egg: His clue video has imagery of a swan, a sketch of a ballgown, a skateboard and, of course, the Egg \u2014 who says he is \u201cunapologetically himself.\u201d He also says, \u201cYou might figure that coming to The Masked Singer is a bit of a leap for me.\u201d and starts a clue with, \u201cAfter years of being on top of the pyramid \u2026\u201d Could it be any more obvious what this guy does for a living?\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Johnny Weir: Well, for one thing, he was unmasked in episode one \u2014 so if you watched all the way through, you already know that the Egg turned out to be three-time U.S. national champion figure-skater and Olympic commentator Johnny Weir. (Yes, the skateboard imagery in his clue video was a rude pun.) Did I think it was Adam Rippon for a hot minute? Yes, but then I realized that Johnny Weir has appeared on such fine reality-TV programming as The Rachel Zoe Project, Say Yes to the Dress, and Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. He\u2019s written an autobiography, started a fashion line (hence the ballgown sketch) and, most importantly, he released a pop song called \u201cDirty Love\u201d (which \u201cshot to No. 1 on the Japanese Amazon sales charts shortly after its worldwide,\u201d wrote Fireworks Sports Marketing, the firm that represents Weir.) The Egg sang Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cJust Dance\u201d; Johnny Weir once skated to \u201cPoker Face\u201d in 2010 and \u201cBad Romance\u201d in 2011.\n\nWhy it might not be Johnny Weir: It is.\n\nWho is the Ice Cream on The Masked Singer?\n\nThe Ice Cream is YouTuber Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins. Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the Ice Cream: His clue video is heavy on cash-throwing and the interiors of a glitzy mansion, but why would someone so seemingly accomplished go on The Masked Singer? Great question. \u201cI got over a billion reasons to be proud of my hard work and determination,\u201d the Egg says, adding: \u201cI am used to performing in front of millions of people, being here is a game changer because I\u2019m behind a different kind of mask.\u201d The he does a karate chop, before faux-DJing in front of suits wearing emoji masks. Are you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevin: Aside from the fact that he was unmasked in episode one, Ice Cream was clearly of the YouTube realm \u2014 something that Jenny McCarthy guessed during his clue video. She wasn\u2019t too far off: Ninja is mainly a streamer, meaning millions of kids watch him play video games like Fortnight on platforms like Twitch. This has made him rich, but not quite known outside the realm of teens and their parents. His Masked Singer background dancers did his famous \u201cPonPon Dance,\u201d and that DJ thing probably refers to a co-headlining gig he once did with an actual masked DJ, Marshmello, in Vegas.\n\nWhy it might not be Ninja: It is.\n\nWho is the Butterfly on The Masked Singer?\n\nIs the Butterfly \u2026 Michelle Williams? Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the Butterfly: Her clue video is all about growth, change, and metamorphosis. \u201cAfter achieving success in many stages of life,\u201d she says, while posing for a photographer against a backdrop. She also says that she \u201cfound [herself] terrified in the one place [she] used to call home,\u201d and then we see a photo of London\u2019s Big Ben in her Butterfly eye. \u201cI\u2019m here to take you to church,\u201d she finishes as the suits perform a baptism and a giant cross appears.\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Michelle Williams: Before you ask, not that one. The other one. Michelle Williams of Destiny\u2019s Child fame. The \u201cmany stages of life\u201d refer to her time in the pop group, but also her time onstage, performing in a national tour of Grease. And if the London thing is throwing you for a loop, Williams also played Roxie Hart in the West End\u2019s Chicago (as the first black actress to do so!), and so she spent quite a bit of time living in London. Williams also is super religious, releasing Christian music like 2014\u2019s \u201cSay Yes\u201d (which topped the U.S. Gospel charts) and co-starring in a short-lived reality show with her ex-fianc\u00e9, a preacher named Chad Johnson. She was also on the UK\u2019s dance reality-competition show, Strictly Come Dancing, so she\u2019s no stranger to this type of thing. The Butterfly also chose to sing \u201cBang Bang,\u201d a song by \u201csupergroup\u201d Ariana Grande, Jessie J, and Nicki Minaj. Is that nod to her own time in a three-person pop group? Maybe.\n\nWhy it might not be Michelle Williams: The London reference is a little vague, although with a voice that familiar, Masked Singer producers might be trying to be a little sneaky.\n\nOdds: Very high. And \u201cSay Yes\u201d is a total banger.\n\nWho is the Ladybug on The Masked Singer?\n\nIs the Ladybug \u2026 Kelly Osbourne? Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the Ladybug: Her clue video shows her spinning a big wheel as different images fly by: a ham, a pumpkin, a judge\u2019s gavel, a dog, a skull, a bridge, a scorpion, a baseball bat, and a police car. That\u2019s a lot. She \u201cwas born into the limelight,\u201d she says, and \u201cafter a lifetime of drama,\u201d she\u2019s \u201chere to perform on [her] own terms, without fear of being judged.\u201d The Ladybug has a very strong southern accent, but it\u2019s so strong it sounds practically fake, so let\u2019s just say our Ladybug might not be the best actress.\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Kelly Osbourne: I wasn\u2019t convinced at first, but as I was writing this out, I believe it has to be. She was born into a famous family with plenty of drama and she\u2019s definitely has experienced her fair share of judge-y media coverage. (Plus, she herself was once a \u201cjudge\u201d on E!\u2019s Fashion Police.) As far as the wheel imagery goes, here\u2019s my best take. The ham refers to this clip from The Osbournes where Ozzy and fam throw a ham into their neighbor\u2019s backyard; the pumpkin, the skull, and the baseball bat callback to Kelly\u2019s dad, Ozzy, and his famously Halloween-y vibe (remember the iconic bat-eating incident?); the judge\u2019s gavel refers to Kelly\u2019s own run-ins with the law; the dog refers to the slew of animals the Osbournes always had in their house; the scorpion refers to Kelly being a Scorpio; and the bridge, well, that one I have no idea. Maybe it\u2019s the Tower Bridge because she\u2019s British? For even more convincing evidence, consider her solo music career. Remember \u201cPapa Don\u2019t Preach\u201d? \u201cShut Up\u201d? Add a little age on to that voice, and you\u2019ll pretty much have the Ladybug\u2019s performance.\n\nWhy it might not be Kelly Osbourne: People have suggested Vanna White because of the spinning wheel (too obvious!), Jamie Lynn Spears, and Lindsay Lohan. When Ken suggested Lohan to the Ladybug, she shook her head in disgust \u2014 maybe because Lohan is currently a panelist on The Masked Singer Australia, or because Osbourne isn\u2019t a huge Lohan fan? You pick.\n\nOdds: Medium to high. Kelly Osbourne has been on TV for a very long time. It\u2019s not at all surprising that she would end up here.\n\nWho is the Thingamajig on The Masked Singer?\n\nIs the Thingamajig \u2026 Victor Oladipo? Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the Thingamajig: His clue video gave a lot away, if you ask me. Literally in one line he says he carries \u201ca magic case\u201d and follows it with \u201ckeep up the pace\u201d \u2014 if you know your sports, those are two names of basketball teams. \u201cI\u2019m more than fashion shoots and dreams,\u201d he says, holding up a sneaker. Then he peers down at a cupcake with the number four on top.\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Victor Oladipo: Even a sports-adverse person like myself will notice the usage of \u201cpace,\u201d a.k.a. the Indiana Pacers, a.k.a. Oladipo\u2019s basketball team. He previously played for the Magic. His jersey number is four, and he was born on May 4 (which is why some fans call him \u201cChewbacca,\u201d because May 4 is also known as Star Wars Day. May the Fourth Be With You \u2014 you get it.) Even more convincing, a bunch of YouTube commenters noticed that Thingamajig even has a feather sticking out of his right leg pant, which is the same side on which Oladipo tore his ACL in January. This all before we even mention that Oladipo has an adorable YouTube channel, on which he sings.\n\nWhy it might not be Victor Oladipo: I don\u2019t know much about sports, but it just is.\n\nOdds: Very high. As soon as this guy opened his mouth, it felt like the entirety of Twitter knew exactly who he was.\n\nWho is the Skeleton on The Masked Singer?\n\nIs the Skeleton \u2026 Paul Shaffer? Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the Skeleton: \u201cI\u2019ve been around the block a few times, but I\u2019m far from dead,\u201d he starts off his clue video, which has quite the Vegas feel. Okay, so we know he\u2019s old. Moving on, he says he\u2019s played \u201csecond fiddle\u201d and \u201calways provided support\u201d to what we assume is a leading man. He holds up three keys and opens the door to two suits playing fiddles, before saying \u201ctonight\u2019s going to be a wild and crazy party\u201d (Oh?) and opening the door again to two dudes in Christmas sweaters. And he ends with yet another Saturday Night Live reference: \u201cParty on, dudes.\u201d\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Paul Shaffer: This one isn\u2019t easy. There are a few conflicting clues. We definitely know we\u2019re dealing with an older guy, and they\u2019re really trying to trick us with all these SNL references. \u201cWild and Crazy Guys\u201d was a sketch with Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd; \u201cParty on, dudes\u201d could refer to Dana Carvey in Wayne\u2019s World. So here\u2019s why it\u2019s Shaffer: He led the Saturday Night Live house band for five years, and his main instrument of choice is the keyboard. Plus, he \u201cplayed second fiddle\u201d to David Letterman as the leader of his talk-show band for many years, and often hosts a \u201cswinging showcase\u201d at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Here he is performing.\n\nWhy it might not be Paul Shaffer. Because it could also be Dana Carvey. Or Martin Short. Short often plays supporting roles, he literally supported Steve Martin in 1986\u2019s The Three Amigos, and maybe that\u2019s also what the Skelton\u2019s three keys (and three teeth) are alluding to. But! Carvey and Short are five-foot-eight and five-foot-seven, respectively, and the Skeleton looks a little shorter. Shaffer is five-foot-five.\n\nOdds: Medium. None of these guys seem like they\u2019d be on a show like this, but once I heard Shaffer\u2019s voice, I couldn\u2019t not hear it.\n\nWho is the Tree on The Masked Singer?\n\nIs the Tree \u2026 Ana Gasteyer? Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we now about the Tree: \u201cI love getting dolled up,\u201d says the Tree, who appears to be a Christmas tree and implies that she only gets used once a year. She\u2019s seasonal! Or something. There\u2019s a Public Storage locker with the number 30 on it, and she mentions she\u2019s been \u201cin exile\u201d before talking about baking and cooking and saying she wants to \u201cjazz up\u201d her career. Is she a singing chef? A Lifetime Christmas movie star? Mrs. Claus?\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Ana Gasteyer: The biggest hint is that it sounds exactly like her. Clues aside, it\u2019s kind of undeniable. Plus, Ana is currently plugging her brand new Christmas album, Sugar & Booze, and she previously released a jazz album called I\u2019m Hip. Plus, the baking bit could reference her beloved role as Margaret Jo McCullin on The Delicious Dish and its \u201cSchweddy balls\u201d Christmas episode.\n\nWhy it might not be Ana Gasteyer: Maybe with the overload of SNL clues for the Skeleton, they Masked Singer producers decided to make the Tree\u2019s a big more tricky, even though Gasteyer was also on the show. There\u2019s definitely misdirection here\u2014they want you to think Rachael Ray, Martha Stewart, or maybe even Paula Deen, if we\u2019re talking \u201cexile.\u201d But none of them sing. And let\u2019s be real, Stewart would never do this stupid show.\n\nOdds: Medium to high. There\u2019s no better promo for your upcoming Christmas record than being revealed on The Masked Singer. I hope this works for her!\n\nWho is the Rottweiler on The Masked Singer?\n\nIs the Rottweiler \u2026 Chris Daughtry? Photo: Fox and Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s what we now about The Rottweiler: Our clue video is set in a beauty salon, immediately referencing football \u2026 but he holds up a championship ring that reads \u201cFantasy Champion\u201d and wears a chain that says \u201cFriday Night Lights.\u201d Weird. He then says that he \u201crose to fame overnight,\u201d while we see a bunch of blue roses. A vinyl plays that says \u201cLive\u201d on it. During the sneak peek episode, Rottweiler said: \u201cI\u2019m a total perfectionist, and I\u2019m going to work my tail off to earn your puppy love.\u201d\n\nWhy it\u2019s definitely Chris Daughtry: Once I brushed up on my Chris Daughtry (sorry, Chris!), I realized that it was most likely him. Like Gasteyer and the Tree, the Rottweiler just sounds like him \u2014 he has a pretty distinctive voice \u2014 and that\u2019s a big giveaway. Plus, as a YouTuber commenter and Chris Daughtry fan notes, he has a blue rose tattoo and played football in high school. The \u201cFantasy Champion\u201d ring refers to his big football dreams never realized. The hair salon setting is a jokes about Chris\u2019s bald head and early hair loss, and the \u201chungry competitor\u201d is of course a reference to American Idol, on which he \u201crose to fame overnight.\u201d The biggest giveaway here is when he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not over.\u201d That happens to also be the title of Chris Daughtry\u2019s second single.\n\nWhy it might not be Chris Daughtry: The football stuff seems purposefully misleading? People are suggesting it\u2019s Scott Porter from Friday Night Lights, or Robbie Williams.\n\nOdds: High. And here\u2019s a fun fact: Recently, Build-a-Bear made a special bear in honor of Chris Daughtry\u2019s wife coming out as bisexual on Chris\u2019s new album (and in the pages of People.)", "description": "Who are the celebrities on The Masked Singer?
