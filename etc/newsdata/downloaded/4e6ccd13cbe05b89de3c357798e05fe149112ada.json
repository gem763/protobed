But there\u2019s much more available on the market.\n\nDubai is one city that is embracing mobile technology and redefining business models.\n\nCase study\n\nOne of the newest apps on the market is Dubz. It is an off-airport travel solutions app that allows you to check in your luggage from the comfort of your own home or hotel.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve booked the service a member of the team arrives at your address. They verify your passport, then weigh and tag your luggage before issuing you with a boarding pass.\n\nThey then whisk your luggage to the airport and you next see it at your destination.\n\nOmar Abou Faraj, chief executive and co-founder of Dubz, says apps are becoming instrumental to the economy.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we are able now to bring an airport to a customer\u2019s home requires a certain level of technological readiness that wouldn\u2019t have been possible before.\u201d\n\nAnother innovative app is CAFU - an on-demand fuel delivery service that comes and fills up your vehicle with petrol wherever you are.\n\nYou choose the location and time and CAFU heads straight to you.\n\nAntonio al-Asmar, CAFU general manager, said: \u201cThere is no way an economy can go forward and progress unless we move into the digital age. So, apps have changed the whole way we are living.\u201d\n\nSmart City\n\nThe Dubai government is also getting on board with a unified smart app called Dubai Now.\n\nIt offers more than 50 smart services from 22 government departments.\n\nHessa Alblosshi, director of smart services at Smart Dubai, says having a unified platform is a game-changer for the city.\n\n\u201cBuilding all these small apps and applications costs a lot,\u201d she told Target. \u201cSo having one app, one platform for all government services or even city services, this will really reduce the cost to the government.\u201d", "description": "Apps are big business, with subscriptions continuing to grow into sizeable revenue streams for developers.
