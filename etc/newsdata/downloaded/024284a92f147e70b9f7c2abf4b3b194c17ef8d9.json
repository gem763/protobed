In his letter, he said he would continue his service under the leadership of acting FEMA chief Peter Gaynor.\n\nThe White House hasn\u2019t yet announced the withdrawal of his nomination. The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Byard\u2019s letter, or to a question about whether Mr. Gaynor would be nominated as the agency\u2019s permanent administrator. Flying back to Washington from California, Mr. Trump suggested he would keep Mr. Gaynor in his administrator role. \u201cWe think he would have been very good,\u201d the president said of Mr. Byard, \u201cbut we\u2019re also very happy with the man who\u2019s acting, who has been acting.\u201d Lawmakers in recent days had acknowledged problems with Mr. Byard\u2019s nomination. Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), the chairman of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, told Politico last week: \u201cThere were some issues raised that are being investigated and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about it.\" Related FEMA Official, Contractor Executive Charged Over Puerto Rico Grid Repairs (Sept. 10)\n\nHurricane Dorian Thrashes Bahamas With \u2018Catastrophic\u2019 Winds (Sept. 2)\n\nFEMA to Further Restrict Puerto Rico\u2019s Access to Relief Funds (July 25) A FEMA spokeswoman said Wednesday: \u201cFEMA cannot comment on accusations made regarding a personal matter that allegedly occurred prior to Mr. Byard\u2019s tenure with the Agency; however, Mr. Jeff Byard is a well-respected emergency manager and has honorably served as the Associate Administrator for the Office of Response and Recovery at FEMA for the past two years.\u201d Axios first reported that Mr. Trump intended to withdraw Mr. Byard\u2019s nomination and tap Mr. Gaynor in his place. The Trump administration\u2019s last top disaster relief official, Brock Long, resigned in February after he came under fire for his unauthorized use of government vehicles. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general determined last September that Mr. Long cost the federal government $151,000 through the unauthorized use of government vehicles that included travel to his home in North Carolina and on a family vacation in Hawaii. Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary at the time, ordered Mr. Long at the time to repay the government \u201cas appropriate.\u201d Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
