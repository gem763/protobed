Here, some things you can do up front to secure a better mortgage rate when the time comes.\n\n1. Maintain a Good Credit Score\n\nThis number matters a lot when it comes to procuring a lower mortgage rate. In fact, before you start to fill out a mortgage application, you\u2019ll want to check your credit score and confirm the report doesn\u2019t have any errors that need to be cleared up. The higher the score, the stronger your creditworthiness in the eyes of a lender, a major factor that can help you score a lower rate. (A boost from 600 to 750 could help you get a better rate and save you money in the long term.)\n\n2. Use an Online Mortgage Calculator to Find the Current Rates\n\nGone are the days when your only option for researching and comparing mortgage rates was in person at a bank. Now you can simply go online and use a mortgage calculator (like this one from Chase) to do your homework and see what the going rates are and how feasible it is to go lower.\n\n3. Consider an Adjustable Rate\n\nIf you know you\u2019re going to move in a few years, a lower adjustable rate mortgage (also commonly called an ARM) is worth considering. It works like this: You start with a fixed-rate period (the most common is five years) and typically lock down a lower mortgage rate during that time. In some cases, an ARM is a full percentage point less than a fixed-rate mortgage. Once those five years are up, your rate is subject to market fluctuations\u2014which could go up or down\u2014but that\u2019s only a factor if you\u2019ll still be in the house at that time.", "description": "You\u2019re in the market for a new home\u2014but before you approach the bank about a mortgage, it\u2019s good to know how low you can realistically go.
