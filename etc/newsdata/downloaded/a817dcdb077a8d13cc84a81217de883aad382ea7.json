Photo: Oklahoma Historical Society/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this week, scientists and forensic anthropologists in Oklahoma began searching a Tulsa graveyard for evidence of a mass grave. The effort comes 20 years after a previous team of researchers found a structural anomaly in the city-owned site, featuring \u201call the characteristics of a dug pit or trench with vertical walls and an undefined object within the approximate center of the feature,\u201d the Washington Post reports. The new team hopes to corroborate these findings. If such a grave exists, it will have been filled with the remains of dead black people, victims of a massacre. The Oaklawn Cemetery is located a few blocks from the city\u2019s Greenwood District, known a century ago as Black Wall Street. There, in 1921, white Tulsans perpetrated one of the deadliest race riots in American history, killing as many as 300 black residents, dispossessing 10,000 more, and burning 40 blocks of their homes and businesses to the ground.\n\nTulsa mayor G.T. Bynum, a Republican, has framed this week\u2019s effort as a murder investigation. \u201cWe owe it to the community to determine if there are mass graves in our city,\u201d he told the Post in 2018. \u201cWe owe it to the victims and their family members.\u201d Allegations that black corpses at the time were loaded onto trains, tossed into the Arkansas River, or buried in mass graves have long fueled debate about how to reckon with the killings, but even after the 1999 discovery, the city declined to investigate further. The decision to do so now is partly an attempt at closure as the riot\u2019s centennial approaches. It\u2019s also a reminder of how racist violence has long been used to forcibly reorganize the geography of black American life, with the starkest evidence often lying right underneath our feet.\n\nThe 1921 massacre is usually understood as a manifestation of latent envy, held by local whites toward a neighboring black district defined by remarkable wealth and entrepreneurial independence. But it began officially, on May 31 of that year, with an unverified sexual-assault allegation by a white teenager, Sarah Page, against a black man named Dick Rowland who happened to board the same elevator as her. When Page exited the car screaming, rumors spread that she\u2019d been raped. Angry white people \u2014 encouraged by local reporting, including a Tulsa Tribune story enticing readers to \u201cNab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator\u201d \u2014 laid siege to Greenwood, trapping black residents within its borders, brandishing weapons, and shouting epithets. Scattered fights broke out, and members of the white mob burglarized local stores, amassing guns and ammunition. Shots were fired and white Tulsans stormed the district; some took to the sky in airplanes and dropped kerosene bombs on their black neighbors. The violence lasted 48 hours, leaving hundreds of black people dead and much of the surrounding area razed. Efforts to rebuild and repopulate were met with staunch white resistance. Though Greenwood eventually regained some of its luster, it was never again the Black Wall Street of old.\n\n\u201cWe want full reparations, transparency, and justice,\u201d Kristi Williams, a local activist and member of the public oversight community establishment by the city to supervise the investigation, told the Post this week. All will be determined by the outcome of a process set to unfold as follows: a search for mass graves using radar devices in several local cemeteries, and if found, a decision about whether to excavate the remains therein; DNA testing and cause-of-death determinations performed by a local coroner; and discussions about how to store and then commemorate the dead. Local officials anticipate a reckoning with an atrocity that retains too many unanswered questions. From the Post, quoting Tulsa city councilor Vanessa Hall-Harper:\n\nI hope they find what we know is there. I hope they find the mass graves. We know hundreds of people, perhaps thousands, were murdered. Something was done with their bodies. We hope to get to the truth of where some victims of the massacre were dumped, and ultimately, we will lay them to rest.\n\nThe 1921 killings fit a pattern which, in retrospect, sheds valuable light on how Americans have come to understand race riots. Recent instances of what\u2019s often termed \u201cracial unrest\u201d \u2014 typically black residents incensed by racist conditions protesting and vandalizing the neighborhoods where they live \u2014 have been targets of criticism by those seeking to cast the perpetrators as unruly thugs. But research suggests that such violence is often retaliatory, in a sense, carried out by everyday people pushed past the limits of civil behavior by untenable conditions. Until World War II, almost all race riots in the U.S. were instances of white mobs terrorizing black communities. But according to Isabel Wilkerson, whose book The Warmth of Other Suns recounts how such violence in the South helped spur a mass migration of black people north and west, the 1943 Detroit riot was the first where black people fought back in earnest against their white antagonizers. Usually thereafter, black rioters vying with police became the norm. But the shift cannot be divorced from how previous riots created the black presence in cities like Detroit, Ferguson, and Baltimore in the first place. Black life and where it unfolds in America is largely dictated by where white violence has chased and contained it. Black Wall Street was an example of the unlikely prosperity this could produce, when permitted. But when it became too prosperous, even that was bombed and set ablaze, and many of its black residents were forced to start again elsewhere, creating a new generation of refugees.\n\nThe warlike conditions to which these and other black Americans were subjected are fittingly embodied by their discardment in a mass grave. Such a burial would illustrate both the massive scope of the atrocity and the disdain with which its victims were considered. The search in Tulsa is expected to continue into December or January. Whatever arises from it, the effort to reckon with past harms is fundamentally a noble one. Black life in the city has already been forcibly rearranged so dramatically as a result of the Black Wall Street massacre. The least that can be done is to ensure that those left behind, buried in the ground, are memorialized with the respect they deserve.", "description": "Tulsa, Oklahoma, saw one of the worst racist massacres in U.S. history in 1921, when white locals attacked the Greenwood District, then known as Black Wall Street, and burned it to the ground.
