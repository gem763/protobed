In the finale, we get some long-awaited answers.\n\nThe previous episode ended with Alma traveling, like Alice, through the looking glass. She emerges in the past, on the fateful Halloween night that ended with Jacob\u2019s death and finally discovers who trashed his lab at San Antonio University. As it turns out, it wasn\u2019t corporate espionage or Farnaz\u2019s skinny-armed boyfriend. It was Camila, infuriated that Jacob had secretly been experimenting on Alma (and speculating, fairly reasonably, that he\u2019s actually in love with Farnaz).\n\nAs they argue, Jacob makes the case that no one cares about Alma more than he does because she\u2019s so important to his work. In this moment, the difference between Camila and Jacob becomes crystal clear. They both love Alma in their own way. But Camila is interested in her as a person, and Jacob is interested in her as a means to unlock something he believes is greater than any individual person. His motives may be personal \u2014 derived from his memories of his mother\u2019s own schizophrenia diagnosis \u2014 but the research has long since overwhelmed any actual interpersonal relationships in his adult life. Camila leaves him on the spot, telling him never to come home again, and it\u2019s hard to blame her for it.\n\nAnd that brings us to Jacob\u2019s death. Over the course of the season, it has become increasingly obvious that Jacob\u2019s grandiose conspiracy theory about his own \u201cmurder\u201d doesn\u2019t actually pass the smell test. But the real answer takes an unexpectedly grim turn. The \u201ccar accident\u201d wasn\u2019t an accident at all. It was a murder-suicide, as Jacob \u2014 confronted with the reality of losing both his family and his research in a single night \u2014 deliberately drove into the ravine with Farnaz in the passenger\u2019s seat.\n\nI suspect this knowledge will drastically alter the way Undone plays on a rewatch. (At the very least, Darrold Harris, Farnaz\u2019s boyfriend at the time of her death, will become exponentially more sympathetic.) It\u2019s enough to make Jacob abandon his own quest for self-salvation, urging Alma to travel to the moment of her own car accident and stop it, eliminating the events of the series from the timeline. But this time, Alma refuses, believing that the ghostly Jacob who has been guiding her is better than the broken man who deliberately drove himself and his student off a cliff.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen any evidence of that. But the plan works. Ghost-Jacob merges with the Jacob who died on Halloween night, and his influence is enough that the timeline changes. Jacob ignores the phone call that lured him away from Alma. I\u2019m not exactly clear on how that solves the problem; Camila is still trashing the lab and is presumably still furious about Jacob experimenting on Alma. But it sends Alma careening back to the present, where she becomes convinced that Jacob will emerge, reborn and Christlike, from the temple in Mexico they visited when she was a little girl.\n\nOnce again, Undone pits Alma\u2019s day-to-day life against the urgency of her belief in herself and in Jacob. She finally gets fired for her erratic behavior. She alienates both Sam and Camila, who have concluded that\u2019s she\u2019s schizophrenic. She refuses to take her pills, steals Camila\u2019s car, and drives to the temple, where she plans to wait and see if Jacob will emerge.\n\nAs Alma waits for a miracle, Becca arrives \u2014 sent by Camila \u2014 to keep an eye on her sister in her \u201cdelusions.\u201d While Alma fixates on the possibility of the near-supernatural resurrection of her father, Becca\u2019s problems are grounded in reality: She told Reed she\u2019d cheated on him, and he responded by getting their marriage annulled.\n\nIn a different life, this would have been an ideal time for Alma to be there for Becca. Instead, Becca is in Mexico for her. But Alma thinks her own current predicament holds the solution to Becca\u2019s problem as well. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news: This whole reality is going to go away,\u201d she tells Becca. \u201cAll the stupid shit we\u2019ve done in our lives will just go away.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something almost childlike in Alma\u2019s belief that reversing Jacob\u2019s death would fix all the problems in their lives. Yes, Alma\u2019s and Becca\u2019s lives would probably be better if their dad hadn\u2019t died in a horrific car crash when they were children. But it probably wouldn\u2019t solve the deep-rooted problems in Jacob and Camila\u2019s marriage, or put a stop to Alma\u2019s impulsive and sometimes self-destructive streak, or take away Becca\u2019s impulse to cheat on her soon-to-be-husband just days before the wedding. People are flawed, and there\u2019s no changing that, no matter how far you rewind the clock.\n\nAnd still: Alma waits, hopeful for a single magic bullet to solve all the problems of her messy life. While Becca sleeps, Alma stays up all night \u2014 a vigil captured in a lengthy, almost fisheye-lens shot that heightens Alma\u2019s separation from conventional reality.\n\nBut Jacob never emerges from the entrance to the cave.\n\nOr does he? The finale ends as Becca walks away while Alma spends a few moments by herself. As the sun rises behind the temple, Undone stays fixed on Alma\u2019s face. As the sunlight hits her, her eyes widen and her breathing quickens. And then the show cuts to black and the first season ends. Was Alma merely reacting to the natural earthbound beauty Becca was just celebrating, or did Jacob really come out of that cave at dawn? And if Alma does see Jacob in that moment, can anybody else see him? Can Alma even trust her own eyes anymore?\n\nAt least, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the Inception-like effect Undone is aiming for. But I don\u2019t think it works, because Undone has never really earnestly engaged with the possibility that Alma might actually just be schizophrenic. Sure, it\u2019s understandable why Sam and Camila and Becca would be worried about that \u2014 but we\u2019ve repeatedly been shown evidence that Alma\u2019s ability is real. Over the course of the season, Alma has used it over and over again to collect information she couldn\u2019t have obtained in any other way. (I guess it\u2019s possible she got some of that information from the many boxes of files she swiped from Camila\u2019s atti, but that wouldn\u2019t explain how Alma knew about the Sam breakup or Nancy the security guard, and either way it would feel like a cheat.)\n\nSo yes: plenty of answers and at least one big question hanging over the series as the credits roll. Maybe a second season of Undone will eventually answer it and dig deeper into the ramifications of Alma\u2019s ability, which literally seems to contain an eternal universe of possibilities.\n\nOr maybe the show will end right here, reminding both Alma and the audience that no matter how deep you go, you\u2019ll never have all the answers. Either way: Undone has been quite a ride.\n\nPieces of Mind\n\n\u2022 So now that this journey is over: What would you want out of a second season? Sound off in the comments below.\n\n\u2022 Whatever the truth of that final scene: If the timelines haven\u2019t realigned, Alma will have to build a new life when she gets back to Texas. She has no job, and her relationship with Sam isn\u2019t looking particularly salvageable. Then again, what\u2019s to stop her from rewinding the clock and trying to fix things?\n\n\u2022 Another too-convenient thing I wish Undone had a better answer for: Why did Jacob\u2019s memory of his death stop at the moment he left Alma on the sidewalk? The real answer, of course, is that there\u2019s no TV show if he doesn\u2019t get Alma to investigate his death, which he\u2019d never do if he remembered the truth. But I wish there were a more compelling in-universe explanation for the hole in his memory.\n\n\u2022 Alma\u2019s explanation for why time travel functions differently in Undone than it does in Back to the Future: \u201cTime travel works differently for white people.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Like the last episode\u2019s speech about being human and imperfect, Becca\u2019s final speech to Alma doubles as a statement of the show\u2019s ethos: \u201cReal life is also pretty amazing.\u201d", "description": "The season draws to a close with plenty of answers and at least one big question hanging over the series.
