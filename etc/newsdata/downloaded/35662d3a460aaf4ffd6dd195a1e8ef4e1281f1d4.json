Sanders insisted that his plan was the \u201conly one\u201d that would prevent people going into \u201cfinancial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer.\u201d Biden, as is his wont, said cancer was \u201cpersonal\u201d to him, and objected to Sanders\u2019 contention: \u201cEvery single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it is not true that a person facing such a diagnosis would \u201cautomatically\u201d get Biden\u2019s public option, because access to that public option will still be determined by a complicated system of premiums and subsidies\u2014in other words, means testing. We don\u2019t know how much the premiums under Biden\u2019s public option would cost, but it seems clear that his understanding of health care access is very simplistic. To Biden\u2019s mind, if you\u2019re poor enough to have free or subsidized access to the public option, you should be able to afford all associated health care costs. And if you\u2019re not poor enough, it means you\u2019re sufficiently well-off to bear the costs.\n\nThis was also clear in his much-noted spat with Castro. Castro mentioned his grandmother, who had Type 2 diabetes but also had access to Medicare, and noted that Biden\u2019s plan would require people to opt in, without being automatically covered. Biden took great issue with the assertion that people would have to \u201cbuy in,\u201d leading to the dramatic moment that grabbed everyone\u2019s attention\u2014Castro poking fun at Biden\u2019s memory, asking if he already forgot what he said. Castro was right: Biden did say that people could \u201cautomatically\u201d get his \u201cMedicare for choice\u201d plan. But Biden said \u201cbuy in\u201d, not \u201copt in\u201d\u2014so how could people \u201cbuy\u201d in automatically? Very few American social programs are automatic, including Medicaid, which is often incredibly complicated to sign up for. Biden then clarified that he meant people like Castro\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t have to buy in \u201cif they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden is putting a hell of a lot of faith in his plan\u2019s ability to fairly and accurately determine who can \u201cafford\u201d paying for the public option. His health care plan also does not include any kind of reforms for how seniors pay their Medicare drug costs, which can cost them thousands of dollars per year. (Although he would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and peg drug price increases to inflation, Biden\u2019s plan says nothing about lowering the cost of drugs that are already too high and costing seniors thousands.) Without reforming Medicare, it\u2019s impossible to say that no one\u2019s cancer will send them into bankruptcy. His plans for long-term care are laughably weak, as well: A $5,000 tax credit for informal caregivers is like second prize in the Third Way holiday raffle.\n\n\n\nHowever, the most important moment happened so quickly that it was easy to miss. When Sanders noted that the United States spends twice as much per capita on health care as other countries do, Biden replied: \u201cThis is America.\u201d Presumably, the implication was that America should spend twice what other countries do, because we do everything bigger, better, bolder, with more flavor and half the fat. (It would have been better if Sanders had finished his thought by noting that America spends twice as much as other countries for worse health care outcomes, but no matter.) This is the essence of Biden\u2019s defense of the broad status quo: a patriotic bumper sticker, felt with such keenness it\u2019s hardly surprising that he doesn\u2019t seem to understand anything else about the issue.\n\n", "description": "The Democratic debate reveals that the vice president has only a shaky grasp on his competitors' plans -- as well as his own.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/0de20f2c4dfd024152101deac1791272bdd509a5.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
