The figure shows a threefold quarter-on-quarter increase, from $84.8 million last quarter.\n\nThe quarterly inflows into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust amounted to $171.1 million, wherein July was the month with the highest level of inflows during Q3. As reported in July, Grayscale Bitcoin trust outperformed indices in the first half of 2019, up almost 300% on the year at the time.\n\nDomination of institutional investors\n\nInstitutional investors were the major contributors to the company\u2019s products both in Q3 and year-to-date, with 84% and 83% respectively. Worth noting, total investments into Grayscale products from Jan. 1, 2019 through Sept. 30, 2019 amounted to $382.3 million, while the figure over the past 12 months is $412.3 million.\n\nPreviously, Grayscale\u2019s director of sales and business development Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary stated that institutional investors are constantly piling into the space in 2019. Sharif-Askary said:\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s really funny, I get asked this a lot \u2014 there\u2019s this rhetoric in the media about when are institutional investors going to get involved, when are they going to start investing, and it\u2019s so funny because it\u2019s ironic. We see institutional investors invest with us all the time and that\u2019s been the case for a long time now.\u201d\n\nAhead of conquering the market\n\nOn Oct. 14, Grayscale Investments was approved by the United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to publicly quote its Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund on over-the-counter markets. This purportedly enables the first publicly quoted security based on a selection of digital currencies in the U.S.\n\nIn August, Cointelegraph reported that Grayscale was going to move almost $3 billion worth of its digital currency holdings to American major crypto wallet provider and exchange Coinbase. Coinbase Custody would then serve as custodian of the underlying assets for the company\u2019s products.", "description": "Digital asset management giant Grayscale registered over $254 million in total investments into its products in the third quarter of 2019", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hNGFlMTRiNTRhY2ZjN2E0OTY5YjdmNjgzNGYwMDJkMC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
