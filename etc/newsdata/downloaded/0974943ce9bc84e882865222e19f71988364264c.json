The death toll rose to at least 20 and it is likely to increase when officials ramp up emergency rescue efforts in the coming days. Its trajectory did not include Alabama at any part throughout the week, according to the National Hurricane Centre.\n\nThe mayor, who has met the Democratic National Committee\u2019s requirements to participate in the third primary debates next week, described Mr Trump\u2019s apparent efforts to support his claims about the hurricane as \u201chumiliating\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is an embarrassment for the country,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s literally pathetic. It makes you feel a kind of pity.\u201d\n\nMr Trump would not say who altered the map, telling reporters shortly after the incident: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I just know, I know Alabama was in the original forecast.\u201d He claimed there had been a 95 per cent certainty that the storm would hit Alabama.\n\n\u201cThey thought they would get it as a piece of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was supposed to go \u2013 actually we have a better map than that which is going to be presented where we had many lines going directly, many models, each line being a model, going directly through. And in all cases Alabama was it.\u201d", "description": "Democratic candidate\u00a0Pete Buttigieg says\u00a0he feels \u201csorry\u201d for Donald Trump after the president presented the public with an altered official map of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s forecast to seemingly back his unfounded claims Alabama was within the storm\u2019s trajectory.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/14/pri82818076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
