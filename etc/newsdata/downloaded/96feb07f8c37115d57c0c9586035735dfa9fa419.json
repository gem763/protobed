It bridges a 20 year gap since the first generation droop-snouted 8-series with pop-up headlights \u2013 codenamed E31 - left the road after running for a decade from 1989.\n\nDubbed a soft-focus supercar, it racked up just over 30,000 sales, more than two thirds of which were of models with a V12 engine.\n\nThe newly-reborn 8-series is powered by a meaty new 4.4 litre V8 petrol engine developing 530 horsepower.\n\nIt roars from rest to 62mph in just 3.7 seconds up to a top speed electronically limited to 155mph.\n\nThis is a car built to take on rival Mercedes Benz's big luxury grand tourer, the S-Class coupe and tempt rich buyers away from their Bentley Continental or Aston Martin DB11.\n\n'The fun increases immeasurably when you play with the manual paddle-shift controls on the steering wheel for added involvement,' says Ray Massey\n\nCosting from \u00a3100,045 \u2013 or nearly \u00a360,000 less than a Bentley Continental GT \u2013 it is a beautifully sculpted but very masculine and powerful piece of machinery from the Bavarian car-makers. It's a real Munich muscle-car with all-wheel drive.\n\nThe fun increases immeasurably when you play with the manual paddle-shift controls on the steering wheel for added involvement.\n\nIt was sweaty palm time hurling it around the Estoril race track near Lisbon, with one of the BMW team drivers up ahead acting as my shepherd.\n\nThe new BMW features the thinnest LED headlights the firm has produced to date\n\nSuffice to say the car's prowess, handling, power and suspension sharpened by racing know-how far exceeded my own track driving skills. But it was enough to give me an insight of what this car can achieve in the right hands \u2013 with safety systems keeping me, with a few squeals of rubber on the tightest bends, stick to the tarmac.\n\nAnd how many buyers will ever push it to such extremes.\n\nBut the beauty is that drivers can personalise the set-up of the vehicle to sophisticated levels of driving dynamics to match their mood and skill.\n\nActive roll stabilisation \u2013 using electric swivel motors on the front and rear axles - is an option to enhance sporty handling.\n\nWill it fit in my garage? New BMW 8-series Coupe \u2013 M850i xDrive Price: \u00a3100,045 On sale: From November Length: 4,843mm Width: 1,902mm Height: 1,341mm Wheelbase: 2,822mm Weight: 2,395kg Doors: 2 Seats: 4 Engine: 4.4 litre M Performance TwinPower Turbo V8 petrol Power: 530 horse-power Gears: 8-speed automatic 'Steptronic' with manual paddle-shift over-ride. Wheels: 20-inch M light alloy Y-spoke Top speed: 155mph (electronically limited) Acceleration 0-62mph: 3.7 seconds. Fuel consumption: average 28.8mpg CO2 emissions: average 224g/km\n\nBut it was out on real roads that I had most fun. Cruising amiable along a sunny coastline, where the waves crashed on the shore, was a delight in Comfort mode.\n\nThen up to Sport for taking on those tight hillside hair-pin bends, with a lovely rumble of exhaust. This is enhanced even more in Sport-plus mode, which provides an even more direct response through the steering wheel.\n\nIt also increases to 55mph (from 45mph) the speed at which the rear wheels are steered by up to 2.5 degrees in the opposite direction to the front wheels to increase on-road agility.\n\nIt runs as standard on 20-inch 'M' light alloy Y-spoke wheels with performance tyres, M-sport brakes, head up- display, with a rear view parking and reversing camera, and parking assist.\n\nIt also features the thinnest LED headlights the firm has produced to date with the option of special 'laserlight' with a bean range of 600 metres.\n\nThe windscreen is thermally insulated, there's an automatic tail-gate, enhanced Bluetooth with wireless charging and a sport exhaust system with two sets of tailpipes in a trapezoidal form.\n\nAmid the smart but functional interior is a flash of bling with the grabbable crystal gear-controller.\n\nThe chunky steering wheel packed with finger-tip controls matches the muscular drive while you sit firmly but comfortably in sporty leather multifunction seats, which come as standard, along with the digital dashboard with 10.25 inch control screen.\n\nThough technically a four-seater, don't expect much more than child seats, the odd emergency run, or space for a soft bag in the back from this low-slung two-door sports coupe.\n\nHowever, the two rear seats and backrest will fold down in a 50:50 split to boost the boot space.\n\nThe roofline has a double bubble sculpted design reminiscent of classic racing cars.\n\nThe roofline has a double bubble sculpted design reminiscent of classic racing cars\n\nOptional extras are bundled together in a variety of packages and include soft-close doors, carbon fibre exterior trim. Bowers and Wilkins Diamond surround sound, and sports seat-belts.\n\nDon't expect to be too green, however, official average fuel consumption averages just 28.8mpg with CO2 emissions at a hefty 224g/km.\n\nAlso at launch will be a diesel-powered 840d xDrive 3.0 litre straight-line six cylinder developing 320 horse-power and accelerating from 0 to 62mph in 4.9 seconds with top speed similarly limited electronically to 155mph.\n\nSmart but functional interior, with the grabbable crystal gear-controller\n\nThe chunky steering wheel packed with finger-tip controls matches the muscular drive\n\nFuel economy is easier on the pocket at 46.3mph with CO2 emissions down to 160g/km \u2013 a lesson perhaps to those short-termist politicians who think it's clever to kill off cleaner diesel engines, as both comply with the latest Euro-6 emissions standards.\n\nBMW expects to sell around 1,400 8-series Coupes in the first full year.\n\nNor is this the end of the story. Following on from the Coupe will be an open-topped cabriolet version set for sale around next March, with a range-topping Gran Coupe to follow later next year. Expect even more powerful motorsport inspired M8 versions too.\n\nNew sales and brand boss Pieter Nota said: 'We're right in the middle of the biggest model roll out ever in BMW's history.'\n\nBMW bosses want to get back to the firm's values as pioneering producers of the ultimate driving machines with sporting dynamics.\n\nAll in all, the 8-series Coupe is not a bad start.", "description": "The new 8-series bridges a 20 year gap since the first generation droop-snouted 8-series with pop-up headlights - codenamed E31 -  left the road .", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
