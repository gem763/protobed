Justifying the move, anonymous government officials cited intelligence indicating Iran had crafted plans to use proxies to strike U.S. forces, both off the coast of Yemen and stationed in Iraq. National Security Adviser John Bolton also discussed the intelligence on the record. A consensus appeared to be emerging: that Iran was gearing up for war.\n\nBut multiple sources close to the situation told The Daily Beast that the administration blew it out of proportion, characterizing the threat as more significant than it actually was.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the administration is mischaracterizing the intelligence, so much as overreacting to it,\u201d said one U.S. government official briefed on it.\n\nAnother source familiar with the situation agreed that the Trump administration\u2019s response was an \u201coverreaction\u201d but didn\u2019t dispute that a threat exists. Gen. Qasem Soleimani\u2014the head of the Quds Force, Iran\u2019s covert action arm\u2014has told proxy forces in Iraq that a conflict with the U.S. will come soon, this source noted.\n\n\u201cI would characterize the current situation as shaping operations on both sides to tilt the field in preparation for a possible coming conflict,\u201d continued the second source, who is also a U.S. government official. \u201cThe risk is a low-level proxy unit miscalculating and escalating things. We\u2019re sending a message with this reaction to the intelligence, even though the threat might not be as imminent as portrayed.\u201d\n\n\u201c We\u2019re sending a message with this reaction to the intelligence, even though the threat might not be as imminent as portrayed. \u201d \u2014 U.S. official\n\nThe source added that the administration\u2019s steps are a way to tell the Iranian government that the U.S. will hold them responsible for their surrogates\u2019 actions.\n\nA third U.S. government official close to the situation described the administration\u2019s response this way: \u201cIt is meant to send a clear message and remove any ambiguity from a tense situation. We\u2019re demonstrating the overwhelming capability we can bring to the region.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s specific intentions may be a subject of debate, but there\u2019s little doubt that it has the capability to hit U.S. forces through proxy groups, as the Quds Force demonstrated with lethal efficiency during the Iraq war. According to the State Department, Iranian-backed militants in Iraq killed an estimated 603 U.S. troops between 2003 and 2011, many of them the result of armor-piercing explosively formed projectiles supplied by the Quds Force.\n\nThe Daily Beast has not reviewed the intelligence itself, which is all but certain to be classified. That means that the characterization of the intel\u2014both on the record and anonymously\u2014is crucial. And in this case, there is not a consensus in intelligence and military circles on whether the administration\u2019s interpretation, used to justify the deployment of an addition U.S. aircraft carrier and Air Force bomber task force to the Gulf, was accurate.\n\nThe interpretation of intelligence, particularly on Iran, can often provoke disagreements within the national security bureaucracy. In 2007, a National Intelligence Estimate concluded with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that \u201cTehran halted its nuclear weapons program\u201d in 2003, prompting a controversy over the language used in its top line judgments and fury from those who saw Iran\u2019s public enrichment of nuclear weapons fuel and development of ballistic missiles as a key part of its program.\n\nA senior administration official insisted the Iranian threat intelligence in this case was strong, and said officials in the office of Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, drafted the statement and sent it to NSC specifically asking for Bolton to approve it and that it go out from the White House, rather than the Department of Defense, to highlight the threat\u2019s significance.\n\nPresident Trump signaled a harsher line on Iran even before he took office. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to \u201ctotally dismantle Iran\u2019s global terror network\u201d and once in office his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, used his inaugural press briefing to declare that Tehran was \u201con notice.\u201d\n\nFlynn\u2019s successor, H.R. McMaster, broke with the president on his uncompromising attitude towards the Islamic Republic, but with the appointment of John Bolton has come a more hawkish return to form.\n\nWhen militants fired mortars at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Baghdad in September 2018, the White House released a statement saying that it would \u201chold the regime in Tehran accountable\u201d for any attack that injured U.S. personnel, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited an \u201cincreasing and specific threats and incitement to attack our personnel and facilities in Iraq\u201d while announcing the relocation of diplomats in Iraq.\n\nBehind the scenes, the Wall Street Journal reported, Bolton alarmed Defense Department officials by asking military planners to present options for a possible strike on Iran in response to the incident.\n\nA strike never came but tension between the Trump administration and Iran, already strained after the U.S. walked away from the U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement, has only increased. In recent weeks, the administration has ratcheted up sanctions on the Islamic Republic even further, announcing that it will no longer grant waivers to countries allowing them to buy Iranian crude oil without risk of U.S. sanctions and designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nSources told The Daily Beast that the administration\u2019s decision to designate the Iranian IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization in April likely escalated the tensions that precipitated the showdown that unfurled over the weekend.\n\nIn response, Iranian officials have recently hinted that they would walk away from commitments made under the nuclear deal to limit enrichment of uranium fuel\u2014a key component necessary in the production of nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the apparent intelligence indicating an increased risk to U.S. interests in Iraq, Secretary of State Pompeo made a surprise visit to the country on Tuesday. Pompeo would not offer details on the intelligence about an Iranian threat but said, \u201cThis would be an effort to take American forces out that continue our campaign against ISIS, something that\u2019s incredibly important to the Iraqi Government.\u201d\n\nAfshon Ostovar, an assistant professor at the Naval Postgraduate School who studies Iran and the IRGC, said that Iranian leaders have focused on trying to wait out the Trump administration, but that pressure campaign waged by the White House has led to some internal tension over the policy.\n\n\u201cI suspect that there are some in Iran, particularly some among the IRGC, that would like to push back now. However, it seems that Iran\u2019s leaders are continuing to stress patience,\u201d Ostovar said. \u201cYet every time pressure on Iran increases through additional sanctions, rhetoric, or posturing, I suspect the patience of Iran\u2019s leaders, and their ability to hold back those that advocate retribution against the US, grows thinner.\u201d\n\nWhen Bolton took the unusual step of announcing that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and an Air Force bomber task force were headed to the Gulf, he said that the movement was in response to \u201ca number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings.\u201d\n\nBut one congressional aide cast doubt on the claim that intelligence alone had driven the deployments. The administration, the source told The Daily Beast, was \u201cpivoting off posture moves already underway to respond to what they interpret as real risk in the intelligence reporting.\u201d\n\nStill, the aggressive messaging, meant to dissuade Iran from unleashing its proxies on the U.S., could end up backfiring, the aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cEven if you view it as non-escalatory or in the \u2018escalate to de-escalate\u2019 school (where a tough message is essential to walk things back) it\u2019s taking place in an environment of increased pressure, including the IRGC designation. That context matters.\u201d", "description": "John Bolton and other Team Trump hawks are trumpeting intelligence that Tehran is readying attacks on U.S. forces.
