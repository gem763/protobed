I was undernourished, dehydrated and had high blood pressure.'\n\nAfter the incident on stage Cura\u00e7ao her physician told her she needs to slow down.\n\n'The doctors told me all your vitals are to the extreme. You need to stop, because you are killing yourself. I cried and cried.\n\n'I had to finally accept the fact I was getting older, that I cannot push it and I had been through so many tragedies that I had to stop.\n\n'When I got back to California I went to bed and stayed in bed for weeks, maybe months.\n\n'I was just a total mess and I could not function. My managers were encouraging me to get therapy and I finally did.\n\n'I found a psychiatrist, psychologist and a neuro-feedback doctor; between the three of them I really started feeling like I wanted to live.\n\n'It really helped to just let things out, talk about things that are bothering me and confront them.'\n\nThe Pointer Sisters June, Bonnie, Ruth and Anita attend the 18th Annual Grammy Awards on February 28, 1976\n\nThe siblings suffered a loss in 2006 when June (far left) died of lung cancer aged just 52\n\nAnita (pictured left in 1988) opened up on nearly collapsing during a performance in Curacao that she says was brought on by years of trauma. She has since undergone therapy\n\nAnita admits that the loss of her daughter Jada, who died in 2003 of pancreatic cancer, was the biggest blow and still haunts her today. Her daughter inspired one of the Pointer Sisters' most popular songs named after her.\n\n'I started feeling - was this worth it? I worked so hard to get us a better place to live and get her into schools. My mother really took care of her, because we would always be gone.\n\nI will never get over it. I cry almost every day for my baby. I loved her so much, she was my only child. And I think about her all the time and I am very angry with the world for taking my baby.\n\n'And I remember her crying and asking me not to leave, \"Mama please don't go\". But I had to make money, pay the bills, and work. And I did love what I did, but I lost out on so much of her life. We had talked about all the stuff we were going to do when I got older, and how she going to take care of me.\n\n'I will never get over it. I cry almost every day for my baby. I loved her so much, she was my only child. And I think about her all the time and I am very angry with the world for taking my baby.\n\n'I just feel like something could have been done. It has put me in a place where I will be suffering for the rest of my life, because I will never get over this.\n\n'I hope there is something that I can find that will bring me some kind of peace for the rest of the time I am here.'\n\nHer daughter's death came three years after her mother, Sarah, who had been key in helping raise her daughter, passed away.\n\nTragedy struck again in 2006, when Anita's sister June, one of first members of the singing group, passed away from lung cancer aged just 52.\n\nJune's funeral also prompted the public airing of a bitter family feud in which sister Bonnie claimed Anita and other sister Ruth and brothers Aaron and Fritz had ignored her burial wishes.\n\nAnita said her biggest loss in life was her only daughter Jada, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2003. Jada was the inspiration for The Pointer Sisters' hit song of the same name\n\nRuth Pointer and brother Fritz visited June and Jada's resting place in 2018. Anita admitted she felt guilty for missing out on years of Jada's life due to her job\n\nIn a span of seven years, Anita endured the loss of her mother in 2000, her daughter in 2003, and her sister June in 2006. June's death sparked a feud among the sisters after Bonnie claimed the family hadn't honored her burial wishes\n\nBonnie also admitted her sisters did not let her ride in the family car at the funeral.\n\nAnita and Ruth responded that Bonnie had demanded to be let back into the group and was upset that she had not been allowed to rejoin it, and that June had left no instructions for her burial.\n\nThe long therapy and healing process during her four-year break made Anita - who achieved mainstream success with The Pointer Sisters during the 1970s and 1980s winning three Grammy Awards - realize that working can help quash her pain and anguish but only if she channeled it properly.\n\n'All my adult life all I knew was performing. I pushed myself. My motto was I can always do one more show,' she says.\n\n'I was always pushing my talent to the limit - performing shows, traveling, managing a family, the band and then writing songs in between it all.\n\n'Under doctor's care and therapy, I refocused my brain. It had got to the point when I was on the road, I was physically sick and broken, without passion.\n\n'It got to the point where I was so lost that I could not even bare to listen to music anymore. If I listened to music then I would just cry.'\n\nIn 2019 Anita has found her voice again thanks to a chance meeting with Hollywood Museum director Donelle Dadigan last year.\n\nThe pair began discussing an exhibit after the performer revealed how she had kept so much from the band's history.\n\nAnita says most of the sisters' troubles from the past are now behind them and hopes to do a something special for their 50th anniversary this year\n\nThe Pointer Sisters with famous late musician Liberace in an undated photo\n\nThe three-time Grammy-winning sisters earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994\n\nAfter agreeing to staging an exhibit at the famous venue, at the former Max Factor Building on Hollywood and Highland in LA, Anita's outlook changed forever.\n\n'I guess I did need those four years away, thank God I met Donelle Dadigan, who kind of saved my life.\n\n'She brought everything back to life that I had been working on for decades. It really made a difference being able to see all we had done this way. I thank the Hollywood Museum with all my heart.'\n\nAnd the veteran singer has given hope to fans that the group, famous for hits like Jump For Your Love and He's So Shy, will reunite for a 50th anniversary project.\n\nFans briefly saw a taste of their comeback on September 30 when they sang together at the opening of the Hollywood Museum exhibit celebrating their careers.\n\nDailyMailTV's exclusive footage captured the emotional moment Anita joined Bonnie and Ruth for the first time in a decade.\n\nAnita says that working on the display, featuring hundreds of costumes and memorabilia pieces, has been a key factor in her recovery along with three years of therapy.\n\nThe singer is much happier these days and has even taken a break from therapy feeling that there 'has been a lot of healing' between herself and the co-star sisters.\n\nSmiling she said: 'Most of the troubles from the past are behind us. They usually stem from the men in our lives - that is where the troubles comes.\n\n'It is hard to talk about and understand what happens.\n\n'They persuade the women to do things and it sort of clashes with the sisters. We are doing pretty good right now.'\n\nAnita and her sisters now hope that their profile will rise again in this milestone year.\n\n'We are working on some projects together that we hope will pass.\n\n'We are all kind of on the same page getting through these last years making something happen that will take us out with a bang. That is what we are hoping for.\n\n'Because we are sisters, because we love each other, and I will never stop loving my sisters.\n\n'We haven't been in the studio together for a long time. It would be an amazing blessing for us to sing together.\n\n'It would just thrill my heart to all go in and do an original song or an old song... just do something together me and my sisters.\n\n'It would be like heaven for me, because I believe we can pull it off as it would be an amazing thing to do - a dream come true.'\n\nReunion: The Pointer Sisters briefly made a comeback on September 30 when they sang together at the opening of the Hollywood Museum (pictured) exhibit celebrating their careers\n\nAnita met Hollywood Museum director Donelle Dadigan and the pair began discussing an exhibit after the performer revealed how she had kept so much from the band's history\n\nWorking on the display, featuring hundreds of costumes and memorabilia pieces, has been a key factor in her recovery along with three years of therapy, she said\n\nAnita credits the museum director for 'saving her' and bringing her life's work back to life\n\nAnita says that the last time the three sisters stood on stage was 2010 when Bonnie came on for a small cameo at The Greek Theater, Los Angeles.\n\nOther than small song performances, Anita, Ruth, and Bonnie have not been on stage for a full scale gig in over 43 years.\n\n'We have not done a real show for decades since me Ruth and Bonnie played together. Bonnie left in 1976, but would join us here and there over the years, but I feel we are ready.\n\n'I know it's the 50th, it makes me think the only way I would want to return would be to do something special like at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\n'The love from the fans is there and our voices are there too.
