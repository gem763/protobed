No reason was given, but the move has been interpreted as another step in Bolsonaro\u2019s campaign to strip back protections from the country\u2019s indigenous people.\n\nPereira\u2019s sudden dismissal \u201crepresents another backwards step in the policy to protect isolated indigenous peoples\u201d, the letter reads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if this government has a rule: to remove dedicated and competent people and put incompetents in their place,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Carlos Meirelles, a signatory of the letter who pioneered the \u201cno contact\u201d policy adopted by Brazil\u2019s indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI.\n\nIsolated or recently contacted indigenous people have little or no contact with the outside world, but are under increasing threat from illegal loggers, land-grabbers and miners who encroach on their territories.\n\nExperts say that under Bolsonaro, violent land invasions have increased significantly. According to a recent report by Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Missionary Council, 153 indigenous territories had been invaded since January \u2013 compared to 76 last year.\n\nLast week, Bolsonaro\u2019s mining minister Bento Albuquerque announced that draft legislation to allow mining and agriculture on indigenous lands should be ready later this month.\n\nContacted by the Guardian, Pereira said he could not comment on the reason for his dismissal as he didn\u2019t have any information about it. He said Funai should be the ones to explain why he was fired.\n\n\u201cIsolated indigenous people are extremely vulnerable. They don\u2019t have political support; they don\u2019t speak with journalists or other indigenous groups,\u201d Pereira said.\n\nFunai described Pereira\u2019s dismissal as part of a management restructuring to \u201coptimize work in progress\u201d. His replacement, Paula Wolthers de Lorena Pires, is an anthropologist and indigenous specialist.\n\nIn April, Pereira led a mission to protect an isolated tribe from violent conflict with another group in the far-flung Javari Valley Reserve near the border with Peru.\n\nLost tribes: the 1,000km rainforest mission to protect an Amazon village | Dom Phillips and Gary Calton Read more\n\nThe region concentrates the largest number of isolated and recently-contacted tribes in the world. In 2018, The Guardian accompanied Pereira on a 1,000km expedition to the region.\n\nThe vast, resource rich region is swiftly becoming a new economic frontier for armed poachers, loggers, wildcat miners and drug traffickers.\n\nLast month, a contractor who manned a National Indigenous Foundation base in the Javari Valley \u2013 that had been attacked several times \u2013 was murdered by gunmen on a motorbike in Tabatinga on the border with Colombia and Peru.
