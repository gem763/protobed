Lord Coe, who was a long-term consultant for Nike, replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t actually read the report. I\u2019ve read the executive summary, which took me through what was actually said. That was enough for me to get into business mode, which was to make sure that athletes don\u2019t have a relationship with a suspended coach.\u201d\n\nDina Asher-Smith hurtles to historic treble as GB win relay silver in Doha Read more\n\nCoe also cautioned those criticising Sifan Hassan, the Dutch athlete previously coached by Salazar, after she raced away from her rivals to win gold at the 10,000m and 1,500m. When it was put to Coe that the British athlete Laura Muir had said that the race would be \u201cunder a cloud\u201d because of Salazar\u2019s ban, he answered: \u201cSadly it is the world we live in. It is inevitable that outstanding performances, given the broader nature of trust, are permanently questioned. I\u2019m sure that when I was breaking three world records in 41 days back in 1979 there were people looking slightly askance at what I did.\u201d\n\nHowever Coe added: \u201cI think we have to be quite careful about how we draw conclusions from the performance paradigm and shifts in that performance. The Athletics Integrity Unit are permanently vigilant. And there are tests that are intelligence-led.\n\n\u201cIt is not like some sports where there are 30,000 tests and most of them are pretty meaningless. But we also have to be protective of athletes\u2019 reputations, and I think that is a sensible precautionary balance.\u201d\n\nCoe also defended the decision to take the world championships to Doha \u2013 and hailed the performances at the event as the best ever. And despite the event being dogged with controversy, low crowds and concerns over the heat and humidity, Coe said it should be viewed as a success.\n\n\u201cOur sport is in pretty good shape,\u201d said Coe, who on Sunday bestowed the Golden Order of Merit, the IAAF\u2019s highest award, on the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, for his services to sport.\n\n\u201cIt is pretty clear to us on athlete performance this is the best world championships we have ever had.\u201d\n\nIn a spiky press conference, Coe defended the decision to take the event to Qatar despite its human rights record, adding: \u201cIt is really important that the sport moves around the world, and that it cannot forge its relationships based on political structures or transitory political systems.\n\n\u201cWe would not have sporting relationships if we predicated that on. That is why sport will continue to work and sweat as hard as it does to make social change.\n\n\u201cWe are not competitors we are collaborators and organisations that are smart are actually partnering as they realise they can elicit that change.\u201d", "description": "Sebastian Coe has admitted he has not read the report that led to Alberto Salazar being banned by the US Anti-Doping Agency and also cautioned those criticising Sifan Hassan", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f1891767a8ecee3b0a4f2aac383491b9d247cf2/59_171_3419_2051/master/3419.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70fd988ed91afacd6923e4bcabbe4184", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
