I would say that is definitely questionable. We don\u2019t know, only the player knows.\n\n\u2018Is he injured, is he ill? One of the things as a player you have got to be available for selection & you want to give consistency.\u2019\n\nMesut Ozil has made just one Premier League appearances for Arsenal this season (Picture: Getty)\n\nOzil, however, insists his reasons for missing so many games have always been genuine, while there have been many occasions where he has played through the pain barrier to play for Arsenal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I get really frustrated when I miss a game through illness and people question if it is genuine,\u2019 he told The Athletic.\n\n\u2018Yes, it happened a few times \u2014 usually in the winter \u2014 but what am I supposed to do? If you knew me, you would know it takes a lot for me to miss a game and I have never used sickness as an excuse. Actually the opposite.\n\n\u2018I played many games when I was ill or had injuries. Before the Champions League game against Bayern Munich [in March 2017], I was sick and Arsene told me I was not in the squad because of that. The next morning, the guys from Arsenal called me and said, \u2018Listen, you have to come to the stadium, you have to be in the squad\u2019. Despite my illness, I joined the squad and played the last 20 minutes.\n\n\u2018Most players don\u2019t play when injured or sick \u2014 it influences your game, you can\u2019t give everything \u2014 but I was always available unless it was impossible.\u2019\n\nOzil also took issue with the accusation that he is only capable of showcasing his playmaking abilities against so-called lesser opposition.\n\nHe added: \u2018It always happens that an ex-player stands there on TV and criticises me,\u201d he says. \u201cOthers just continue the theme and it gets in everyone\u2019s heads.\n\n\u2018If we don\u2019t do well in a \u2018big\u2019 game, it\u2019s always my fault. If that\u2019s true, how do you explain our results in the \u2018big\u2019 games when I wasn\u2019t involved? There\u2019s no real difference. I know people expect me to offer more, dictate play and make the difference \u2014 I do, too \u2014 but it\u2019s not that straightforward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not the only player in the team and, don\u2019t forget, some of our opponents are simply better than us. Also, what is a \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019 game? In the Premier League, anyone can beat anyone. Look at Wolves and Norwich beating Man City, or Newcastle and West Ham beating Man United.\n\n\u2018So you can\u2019t say my good performances only came in \u2018small\u2019 games because these games don\u2019t really exist. The intensity is there in every match and often the \u2018small\u2019 teams raise their standard against the \u2018big\u2019 teams.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mesut Ozil insists he\u2019ll see out Arsenal contract despite struggles under Unai Emery\n\nMORE: Sheffield United \u2018fancy their chances\u2019 in front of \u2018hostile crowd\u2019 against Arsenal, says Chris Wilder", "description": "Mesut Ozil has hit back at his critics who claim he only performs against smaller team and have critised his fitness record.
