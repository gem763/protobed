China hopes that relevant people will understand the truth about problems in Hong Kong, act carefully and do useful things for the friendship between China and Thailand.\"\n\nHong Kong has seen months of protests led by young activists against the city's Beijing-backed government amid fears Beijing is gradually eroding freedoms promised when the city returned to China from British rule in 1997.\n\nChina denies that and has accused Western countries of stoking anti-China sentiment in Hong Kong.\n\nWong and Thanathorn met on Oct. 5 at the Open Future Festival in Hong Kong, attending as speakers at the annual event.\n\n\"Under the hard-line authoritarian suppression, we stand in solidarity,\" Wong wrote in a tweet that showed a picture of him standing next to the Thai politician.\n\n\n\n\n\nPICTURE CLUE\n\nThanathorn said he was not involved with the Hong Kong protests. He also said he respected Hong Kong's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, and supported freedom of expression.\n\n\"I have always supported people's rights to peaceful self-expression. I wish to see the situation in Hong Kong resolve,\" Thanathorn said in a Facebook post.\n\nThai army chief General Apirat Kongsompong indirectly criticized Thanathorn's meeting with Wong on Friday during a press briefing in which he accused opposition politicians of inappropriate behavior.\n\n\"Wong came to Thailand countless of times. To meet whom? The meetings had hidden agendas. Were they conspiring, cooking up something together?\" Apirat asked.\n\n\"And with the incidents in Hong Kong, someone went, to give moral support, to give encouragement,\" Apirat added, showing the picture of Thanathorn and Wong that was posted on social media, though Thanathorn was blacked out in the image.\n\nThailand was run by a military junta for five years after then-army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government.\n\nElections in July were won by Prayuth's pro-army party in a vote that opposition parties said was organized to ensure military control of politics.\n\nThe Thai Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Chinese embassy's statement but referred to a statement in September stating that Thailand regarded the situation in Hong Kong as China's internal affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing by David Goodman, Robert Birsel)", "description": "The Chinese embassy in Bangkok has condemned Thai politicians for showing support for Hong Kong activists involved in anti-government protests, saying it could harm the relationship between the two countries.
