The Bank of Russia previously eased in June and July, and said more cuts were likely amid slowing inflation.\n\n\"There's quite wide expectations that rate might be cut again by a quarter of a percent on Friday. We shall see, but definite trend is to lower key rate in Russia,\" Andrey Kostin, chairman of Moscow-based bank VTB, told CNBC's Tanvir Gill at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia.\n\nKostin said inflation in Russia is expected to be around 4%, but the key rate is currently 7.25% \u2014 much higher than that in major economies around the world. That means the central bank has room to ease monetary policy even more to support the economy, added Kostin.", "description": "The Russian central bank had previously eased in June and July, and said more cuts were likely amid slowing inflation.", "authors": ["Yen Nee Lee"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106112608-1567659337821gettyimages-1149971899.jpeg?v=1567659438", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
