And boy, did he say something! He was being interviewed at the Obama Foundation Summit yesterday, and from the edited clip that\u2019s out it\u2019s hard to say exactly what the context was. He was being interviewed by a young woman, and the topic seems to have had something to do with youth activism. Anyway, here\u2019s what he said, in full, with just a few little edits of asides like his mention of Malia:\n\n\u201cThis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke and all that stuff\u2026You should get over that quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you.\n\n\u201cOne danger I see among young people particular on college campuses is a sense\u2026[that] the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people, and that\u2019s enough. If I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself, cuz, \u2018Man, you see how woke I was, I called you out.\u2019 Get on TV. Watch my show.
