He now hopes pioneering surgery could give him his eyesight back (Pictures: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nA teenage boy who suffered terrible burns and blindness after an accident as a toddler hopes pioneering surgery could help him see his family again.\n\nZaid Garcia, 16, has defied doctors\u2019 predictions to survive 80% burns to his body after a candle set his bedding on fire when he was two.\n\nHe is fundraising for surgery to remove a layer of skin that covers his eyes, and eyelid reconstruction surgery to help him see again.\n\nThe youngster, from Galveston in Texas, wrote on his GoFundMe page: \u2018When I was two-and-a-half my mum took me to bed and\u2026a candle fell and it caught on fire.\n\n\u2018I was super injured. I\u2019ve had so many operations now that I can\u2019t even remember.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll probably have more skin grafts (in the future).\n\n\u2018They amputated both my hands and they took the fingers too. I have both my legs and feet.\u2019\n\nZaid added: \u2018I have five toes on the left and on the right, I have one toe. I don\u2019t walk normally. I don\u2019t step flat.\n\n\u2018The doctors shut my eyes under the skin.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just take them out \u2013 probably because they thought I would see in the future.\n\nZaid was so distressed by his ordeal that he tried to kill himself, but has since come to terms with his injuries, and is now focused on seeing his family again (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\u2018So my next hope is to get my vision back. I\u2019ve been blind since the accident. If I was to have this surgery it would be the first time I\u2019d see the world properly (since before the fire).\n\n\u2018To be able to see my family again after 14 years will be good.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019ll be cool. The first thing I want to see would be one of my friends.\n\n\u2018My best friend from school, Julia. I\u2019d like to see her beauty, I guess.\u2019\n\nZaid was injured while living in his native Mexico, and later flown to a hospital in San Antonio, Texas, for specialist treatment.\n\nZaid lost nine of his toes on one foot, but his eyes are intact beneath a layer of skin, with surgeons now set to reconstruct his eyelids (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nZaid with his mother Otaida Carillo. His fundraising efforts have rocketed past $300,000 (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nHe said it was \u2018hard\u2019 growing up disfigured and that people \u2018are scared\u2019 of him \u2018because of the way I look.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZaid was so distressed by people\u2019s reaction to his appearance, he once tried to take his own life.\n\nHis mother Otaida Carillo has since helped him come to terms with his injuries, with the youngster now expressing himself through singing, poetry and drawing.\n\nHe added: \u2018My parents say to me \u201cBe good\u201d when I go to school.\n\n\u2018They are very supportive and encourage me to carry on as if nothing happened.\u2019\n\nZaid\u2019s fundraising has rocketed past its initial $50,000 target to over $300,000.
