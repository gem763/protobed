Even as investors lose their appetite for cash-burning startups, newly-listed Prosus has waded into the bidding for Just Eat, slapping down a 4.9 billion pound order for the UK group. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a healthy meal.\n\nThe hostile bid by the Amsterdam-listed company, which was spun off by South Africa\u2019s Naspers earlier this year, is an attempt to muscle aside an agreed all-share offer from Dutch group Takeaway.com. That deal has wilted in recent months as the buyer\u2019s share price declined. At the close of trading on Monday it valued each Just Eat share at 595 pence, well below the 710 pence cash offer from Prosus.\n\nDespite the valuation gap, Just Eat\u2019s board rejected the Prosus offer, arguing that it \u201csignificantly undervalues\u201d the company. Investors appear to agree. Just Eat shares were trading at 744 pence by lunchtime on Tuesday, implying hopes for a bidding war. Hedge fund Cat Rock Capital, which owns around 3% of the company, optimistically declared Prosus should pay at least 5 times Just Eat\u2019s expected revenue for 2020, implying an offer worth 925 pence.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful Takeaway.com has the stomach for a fight. The company founded by Jitse Groen is already giving Just Eat shareholders more than half of the combined group and has limited scope to add any cash to the bid.\n\nProsus CEO Bob van Dijk, meanwhile, seems ready to run up a big tab. His company\u2019s 108 billion euro market value largely rests on its stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent. Nevertheless, it had net cash of almost $6 billion on its balance sheet at the end of June. Van Dijk on Tuesday promised a substantial amount of extra investment to help fund Just Eat\u2019s push to recruiting its own delivery drivers.\n\nThat\u2019s necessary because Just Eat is losing market share. On Monday the company announced growth in UK food orders had slowed to 8% in the most recent quarter, as consumers switched to fast-food deliveries from chains like KFC, which has a partnership with rival Uber Eats.\n\nProsus already owns stakes in Germany\u2019s Delivery Hero and Brazil\u2019s iFood, whose investors include Just Eat. Crashing into the UK means more competition for Uber Eats and Deliveroo. The latter recently agreed an investment from Amazon, which is facing regulatory scrutiny. That\u2019s good news for diners keen to order food from their sofas, but makes for less wholesome returns.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Britain\u2019s food delivery fight keeps attracting new diners.
