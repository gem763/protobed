Clinton tries to stop House aid bill\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton is urging a group of House Republicans to give up their push for a bill that would slash payments to the United Nations and limit aid to Egypt, Pakistan and the Palestinian Authority, among other groups.\n\nClinton said in a letter Tuesday that she would urge President Barack Obama to veto the bill if it passes in both houses of Congress because the measure \u201cwould be debilitating to my efforts to carry out a considered foreign policy and diplomacy, and to use foreign assistance strategically to that end,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe bill cleared the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week in an effort to cut $6.4 billion from the president\u2019s request for $51 billion in foreign aid for 2012. While it has the potential to pass the GOP-controlled House, it\u2019s seen as unable to get through the Democrat-led Senate.\n\nThe bill would impose \u201conerous restrictions\u201d on State Department operations and foreign aid, Clinton wrote, and the \u201csevere curtailing\u201d of dues payments to international groups including the UN and the Organization of American States would be damaging.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s proposal to block funding to countries that don\u2019t meet corruption standards \u201chas the potential to affect a staggering number of needy aid recipients,\u201d as do proposals to restrict aid to Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen and the Palestinian Authority. The bill would only allow the flow of money to those countries if the Obama administration was able to certify that no members of terror groups or their sympathizers were serving in their governments.\n\nBrad Goehner, a spokesman for Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), the chairwoman of the House committee, told the Post that the letter was \u201cdisappointing, particularly given the current debt crisis, that the Obama administration is fighting to keep sending taxpayer money to foreign organizations and governments that undermine U.S. interests.\u201d", "description": "Clinton said she would urge Obama to veto the bill if it passes in both houses.", "authors": ["Jennifer Epstein"], "top_image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110727_hilary_letter_ap_328.jpg", "published_at": "2011-07-27"}
