REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump responded positively to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of creating a new nuclear deal with Iran, saying that he respected Johnson and was not surprised he had floated the idea.\n\n\u201cHe does want a new deal because the other deal was ready to expire - very short number of years left,\u201d Trump said, referring to the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with major powers and that the U.S. president abandoned last year.\n\nUnder that agreement, Iran committed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and other sanctions that had crippled its economy.\n\nTrump reimposed U.S. sanctions last year. In May, he tightened them further and sought to drive Iranian oil exports to zero. He has criticized the earlier deal, negotiated under then-U.S. President Barack Obama, for \u201csunset\u201d clauses under which some of its provisions expired as well as for its failure to address Iran\u2019s missile program and regional activities.\n\n\u201cI respect Boris a lot and I am not surprised at all that he was the first one to come out and say that,\u201d Trump said of Johnson\u2019s comment that \u201cwhatever your objections to the old nuclear deal with Iran, it\u2019s time now to move forward and do a new deal.\u201d\n\nIn fact, others including French President Emmanuel Macron., have spoken about the possibility of a new deal with Iran for more than a year.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump responded positively to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's idea of creating a new nuclear deal with Iran, saying that he respected Johnson and was not surprised he had floated the idea.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433055340&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1SX", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
