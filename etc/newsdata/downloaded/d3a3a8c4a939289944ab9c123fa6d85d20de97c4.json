Her grandmother turned to natural health in 1941 and followed a strict diet of fruit and vegetables. She distrusted the medical profession and wouldn't go near doctors. Antibiotics and other medicines were out. Leask recalls her maternal grandmother's attitude as: \"If you get sick, you fast. That will rid the body of toxins.\"\n\nHer mother adopted a similar attitude. When Leask's elder brother was eight, he hurt his head, which led to profuse bleeding. Her mother took him to a doctor, who was horrified to discover the boy had not had a tetanus - or any other - injection. After discussing the doctor's advice, Leask's parents decided to immunise all four of their children.\n\n\"When [my mother] finally owned up to my grandmother,\" Leask recalls, \"my grandmother said: 'This is the worst day of my life'.\" Happily, it did not lead to estrangement.\n\nLeask studied nursing and midwifery after leaving school, and then worked for a Red Cross community health program before studying towards a masters degree and later a PhD in public health.\n\nShe has carried much of what she learnt about the mindset of vaccine refusers into her role as a teacher, researcher and chairman of a World Health Organisation working group into measuring the behavioural and social drivers of vaccination.\n\nOne of Leask's bugbears is the language used to describe people who do not immunise their children or who don't get immunised themselves.\n\n\"Putting some nuance around the language is really important if we are going to make headway in addressing this public health issue,\" she says. The Sydney University academic reserves the term anti-vaxxer for \"the activists on Facebook and the people who are yelling at each other\".\n\nThe refusers are those who are trying to do the best by their children, but don't see themselves as being \"anti\". This might be attributed to an alternative lifestyle, a bad experience or \"hyper-vigilance\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe refusers and anti-vaxxers constitute just over 2 per cent of the population in Australia.\n\nThere is another group of parents who are \"hesitant\", where there is a risk they might stop immunising their children; they account for about 12 per cent of the population.\n\nBetween 2 per cent and 3 per cent of parents in Australia don't immunise or under-immunise their children because of poor access to healthcare services.\n\nBy targeting the last two groups, Leask argues, we could make considerable inroads into ensuring more people are being immunised against several serious and potentially lethal diseases.\n\n\"Target the hesitant. Target the fence-sitters,\" Leask says. \"They may be planning to miss out certain vaccines, but you can work with them because they also have some motivation to vaccinate. They're more attentive.\"\n\nFurthermore, if the 12 per cent of parents who are hesitant end up rejecting vaccines, there would be a drastic decline in the level of immunity among the population.\n\nLeask's flagship project is designed to ensure population immunity is maintained. Earlier this year she launched a website for parents who may be prevaricating, providing tips and resources. This week she launched a similar program aimed at health professionals, who are key influencers in parents' decision-making processes.\n\nMaking health services more accessible is another key challenge, both in Australia and globally.\n\n\"I think there needs to be more of a focus on the convenience side of things,\" she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeask's influence extends far beyond Australia. At WHO, her team of 18 experts is building in-depth interview schedules to take to parents, community workers and health workers internationally to gather precise data about why individuals are not being vaccinated. The research is due to be finalised next year.\n\nCloser to home, Leask might have been expected to be right behind the government's No Jab, No Pay policy, introduced in 2016, which withholds childcare benefit and other tax relief from parents whose children are not fully immunised.\n\nIt removed conscientious objection and vaccination objection for non-medical reasons as valid reasons for exemption. The move took away an important valve for hardcore refusers, but it also threatened to add to the disadvantage of families with poor access to healthcare.\n\nFlu immunisation rates, Leask says, are generally poor in Australia: for older people, the proportion is estimated at about 85 per cent.\n\nThat might be justified if the policy could be shown to control disease, Leask argues, but there was no such evidence.\n\n\"The epidemiology didn't support it. We say: mandate vaccines with care. Implement them in a way that doesn't punish children for the decisions of their parents. Look after the access issues. Make sure that the disadvantaged can still access vaccinations, so that you're not punishing them for your failure as a government to provide access services,\" she says.\n\nChildren's vaccinations are only one part of the story. One of the biggest challenges in Australia is vaccination against influenza. The flu vaccine is not covered by the government's National Immunisation Program in the case of healthy adults.\n\nLeask won't comment on whether this is sound public policy, but she gets a flu jab every year. An annual flu injection, she says, is particularly critical for older adults, people with chronic diseases and those whose immunisation systems are compromised. Flu immunisation rates, Leask says, are generally poor in Australia: for older people, the proportion is estimated at about 85 per cent.\n\nAnother of Leask's projects involves leading a team of nine postdoctoral researchers and PhD students to learn why only 20 per cent of Australian children receive flu vaccines.
