Because I was kind of like, I can\u2019t really play a teenager anymore. So she told me that side of it.\u2019\n\nJessica Barden and Naomi Ackie as Bonnie (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nThe announcement of a second season was also met with some scepticism considering how well the first worked as a standalone series \u2013 although Jessica explained how she embraced the pressure.\n\n\u2018Living up to expectation is a huge part of having a successful career so I don\u2019t think any of us wanted it to get like in the way of just being in the moment and enjoying the experience,\u2019 Jessica said.\n\n\u2018We were aware there was an expectation about it, but if you want to have a successful career that\u2019s something you always want to be present in your work.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nShe added: \u2018This is actually really easy to make because the scripts are really good, so it\u2019s really easy to be in the moment.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a show that you really plan or think about doing because obviously Charlie, her skill is writing 50 lines of dialogue in about five words, so you can\u2019t really think about it too much otherwise it wouldn\u2019t really work.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoining Alyssa this time around is newcomer Bonnie, played by Naomi Ackie who is also starring in Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker.\n\nThe End Of The F**king World season 2 kicks off 4 November on Channel 4.\n\nMORE: Channel 4 postpones reality show Smuggled after 39 bodies found in Essex lorry\n\nMORE: Scarlett Moffatt defends controversial Channel 4 series British Tribe Next Door building British semi in African village after backlash", "description": "Jessica Barden has explained how she felt 'insecure' about returning to the show.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-End-of-the-Fking-World-Series-2-Alyssa-6213-1-06e4-e1572012505847_1572246934.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
