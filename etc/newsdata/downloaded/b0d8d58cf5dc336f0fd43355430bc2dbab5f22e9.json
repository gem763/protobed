Hamlin and Logano had been discussing an on-track incident that suddenly flared into a confrontation.\n\nMany Team Penske crew members shielded Logano from a charging Hamlin, and Nichols approached him from behind and knocked Hamlin down. Nichols, crew chief Todd Gordon and competition director Travis Geisler were all called before NASCAR after the fracas.\n\nNichols was found to be in violation of a NASCAR behavioral guideline that addresses \u201cmember-to-member confrontation with physical violence.\u201d\n\nTeam Penske just last week made several crew change swaps that in part reunited Logano with the entire over-the-wall team he had during last year\u2019s championship run.\n\nLogano finished eighth at Martinsville and is ranked fourth in the standings with two races remaining in this round of the playoffs. The field of eight will be cut to four for the title race, and three spots remain available after Martin Truex Jr.\u2019s win at Martinsville.\n\nJoe Gibbs, team owner for winning driver Truex and Hamlin, said emotions played a role in the skirmish between Hamlin and Logano, a former Gibbs driver.\n\n\u201cI think everybody\u2019s crews try and protect their driver, and I think generally what we try and do is separate guys,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cBut we all know emotion runs high. It\u2019s a sport that brings a lot of intensity to the racetrack. Everything you put into this, and if you see somebody do something to you that you think goes against what\u2019s best for you, there\u2019s going to be a price to pay for that.\n\n\u201cI just think it is emotion. It\u2019s part of our sport,\u201d said Gibbs, a former NFL coach with the Washington Redskins. \u201cYou see it in most sports, to be truthful.\u201d\n\nTruex crew chief Cole Pearn, a Canadian and hockey lover, thought the confrontation was minor.\n\n\u201cI grew up getting in a lot of fights in my life, so I don\u2019t have a problem with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why everyone gets so worked up about it here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. I was good at starting them. I don\u2019t know how many I won, I just made sure I had bigger friends to help me out when I got going.\u201d", "description": "Dave Nichols Jr., tire specialist for Joey Logano, horse-collared Denny Hamlin and pulled him to pavement after Sunday\u2019s race at Martinsville.", "authors": ["Published P.M.
