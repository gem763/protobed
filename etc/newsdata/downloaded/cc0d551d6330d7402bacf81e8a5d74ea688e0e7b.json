REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares\n\nThe Solomon Islands was the sixth country to switch allegiance to China since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in Taiwan in 2016. Its decision on Monday dealt her a new blow in her struggle to secure re-election in January amid criticism of her handling of Beijing and rising tension with China.\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan now has formal relations with only 16 countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.\n\nChina claims Taiwan as its territory and says it has no right to formal ties with any nation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Taipei, Tsai said Taiwan would not bow to Chinese pressure, describing the Solomon Islands\u2019 decision as new evidence that Beijing is trying to meddle in the January elections.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years, China has continually used financial and political pressure to suppress Taiwan\u2019s international space,\u201d Tsai said, calling the Chinese move \u201ca brazen challenge and detriment to the international order.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to emphasize that Taiwan will not engage in dollar diplomacy with China in order to satisfy unreasonable demands,\u201d she said.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement it \u201chighly commends\u201d the decision to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and uphold the \u201cOne China\u201d principle, adding it was part of an \u201cirresistible trend\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to work with the Solomon Islands to open new broad prospects for our bilateral relations,\u201d spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement late on Monday.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said Taipei would immediately close its embassy in the Solomon Islands and recall all its diplomats.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government attacked Taiwan purposely before our presidential and legislative elections, obviously aiming to meddle with the voting. The government strongly condemns this and urges people to hold on to its sovereignty and the value of freedom and democracy,\u201d said Wu, whose resignation was rejected by Tsai.\n\n\u201cTaiwan has never bowed to pressure from one single setback, and it won\u2019t be defeated by this blow,\u201d Wu said, urging support from allies in the region to defend Taiwan\u2019s freedom and democracy.\n\n\u201cAT ANY COST\u201d\n\nChina has been trying to secure allies from Taiwan, and Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama and El Salvador had already cut off ties with Taipei in recent years.\n\nBeijing has stepped up pressure to squeeze the island, which have included regular Chinese bomber patrols around Taiwan, since Tsai took office. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, a red line for Beijing.\n\nTsai said the Chinese move could be an \u201cattempt to divert attention\u201d from months of protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, and that China was forcing Taiwan to accept a formula similar to Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement, which guarantees certain freedoms.\n\n\u201cI am confident that the 23 million people of Taiwan have this to say in response: not a chance.\u201d\n\nA senior official familiar with Taiwan\u2019s security planning told Reuters Beijing had issued an \u201curgent order\u201d to secure the Solomon Islands\u2019 allegiance \u201cat any cost\u201d on Sunday night, and called it a move to distract domestic attention from the Hong Kong issue before the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1.\n\nHouses are seen in Honiara in the Solomon Islands, June 3, 2019.
