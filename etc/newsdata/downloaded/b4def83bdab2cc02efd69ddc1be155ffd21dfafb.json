(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nBecause impeachment is a political process, the key consideration is what the American people say.\n\n\u2018Do you think this is impeachable?\u201d Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press, asked Representative Jerrold Nadler about the findings in the report by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe congressman from New York took a dramatic pause before replying, \u201cYeah, I do. I do think this, if proven, if proven . . . some of this would be impeachable, yes. Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin NBC\u2019s studio and outside it, this was greeted as news. Maybe in one sense, it was. Nadler chairs the House Judiciary Committee, where impeachment proceedings originate. Like the Democratic leadership generally, he has been very circumspect on the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi remains reluctant to commit to impeachment. Nadler, however, nudged the Democratic position toward impeachment, slightly.\n\nBut in another sense this was just another no-duh moment. Of course, obstruction of justice \u2014 if proved \u2014 is impeachable. Not even Rudy Giuliani would dispute that.\n\nObstruction of justice was at the heart of the impeachment case that caused President Nixon to resign. It was one of the two charges against President Clinton in his impeachment (the other was perjury).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Even if it\u2019s not proved, obstruction of justice is impeachable. What I mean is: If a majority of House members think the president obstructed justice, they can vote to impeach him, even if the charge would never fly in a court of law. In fact, the House can impeach the president for literally any reason it wants, including noncriminal behavior. That\u2019s because Congress isn\u2019t a judicial body, and impeachment isn\u2019t a criminal proceeding but a political one \u2014 and, save for the trial in the Senate, there\u2019s no appeal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe frustrating thing about impeachment debates \u2014 under every president, not just Trump \u2014 is how lawyers are granted almost priestly authority over the subject, in part to save politicians from making tough calls. That is not what the Founders intended. In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton \u2014 the dude from the musical \u2014 explained that impeachable offenses \u201care of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL\u201d (the all-caps are Hamilton\u2019s). They \u201cproceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust\u201d that does injury \u201cimmediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\nAmong the eleven articles of impeachment against Andrew Johnson, Article 10 remains my favorite. It charged the president with attempting \u201cto bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach, the Congress of the United States, . . . to impair and destroy the regard and respect of all the good people of the United States for the Congress and the legislative power thereof.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s great stuff.\n\nBecause impeachment is a political process, the key consideration isn\u2019t what criminal law says but what the American people say. Yet they too have abdicated their responsibilities to call out leaders who have violated the Constitution or simply the public trust. When President George W. Bush signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the McCain-Feingold Act, restricting certain spending on political campaigns), Bush said the law presented \u201cserious constitutional concerns.\u201d He signed it anyway, saying he\u2019d leave it for the courts to deal with them. Bush was right about his concerns, as the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe president takes an oath to uphold the Constitution. In Bush\u2019s own words, he violated the spirit of that oath. Congress, of course, wouldn\u2019t impeach a president for signing a law it passed. But I wish I lived in a country where voters saw that as an impeachable act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorse, Americans now seem to believe that presidents from their \u201cside\u201d can take whatever steps the Supreme Court will let them get away with. President Obama unilaterally overhauled U.S. immigration policy, though he had repeatedly said he didn\u2019t have the authority to do it. Republicans were outraged at this abuse of executive power \u2014 and they shouldn\u2019t have been alone. But they were, so now they\u2019re not inclined to share Democrats\u2019 outrage over Trump\u2019s excesses.\n\nCongress has impotently outsourced its own judgment to lawyers, courts, executive branch bureaucrats, and, most importantly, to a public capable only of partisan outrage. So now congressional Democrats wrestling with whether to impeach Trump are pretending they need some legal smoking gun. It\u2019s all a canard. All they need are votes \u2014 first in the House, then in the Senate \u2014 and the support of Americans around the country. They might have enough of the former but probably not of the latter.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "Congress has impotently outsourced its own judgment to lawyers, courts, executive branch bureaucrats, and, most importantly, to a public capable only of partisan outrage.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
