That\u2019s the thing, we don\u2019t know, and we have to be able to protect ourselves,\u201d Ms. Lahren said during the interview Friday morning.\n\n\u201cDisgusting, anti-immigrant rhetoric from @TomiLahren in the wake of El Paso,\u201d Mr. Castro tweeted about the interview afterward, referring to the Texas city near the Mexican border where 22 people were killed last month during a mass shooting waged at a local Walmart store.\n\nThe Associated Press previously reported that the suspected Walmart shooter confessed to authorities upon being arrested following the rampage and stated that he had purposely targeted Mexicans. Police have said that the suspect, Patrick Crusius, is believed to have uploaded a racist manifesto to the internet moments before the massacre in which he described the attack as a response to a \u201cHispanic invasion.\u201d\n\nMs. Lahren, 27, apologized on Twitter for what she said in the interview a few hours later Friday, 10 minutes after being called out by Mr. Castro.\n\n\u201cNot what I meant & I apologize for the way it came out. I simply mean without a secure border we don\u2019t know who is coming into our nation & those who wish to do us harm will exploit it. I\u2019m NOT advocating for violence against any person, regardless of race or immigration status,\u201d tweeted Ms. Lahren.\n\nVirtually all candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, including Mr. Castro, have spoken in support of enacting stricter gun control laws.\n\nThe host of \u201cNo Interruption\u201d on Fox Nation, Ms. Lahren has frequently advocated in support of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. She even recently launched a clothing line, \u201cFreedom,\u201d that she advertised as being for women \u201cwho love God, Guns and Country and are proud to show it.\u201d\n\nShe has since acknowledged that apparel sold as part of the clothing line, called \u201cFreedom,\u201d is not made in America, however.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
