The Speaker, John Bercow, condemned it as an \u201cact of executive fiat\u201d. Opposition MPs tried to physically stop Bercow from leaving his chair to go out to the House of Lords for the prorogation formalities.\n\nPlay Video 2:35 Chaos in the Commons as parliament is suspended to chants of 'shame on you' \u2013 video\n\nLabour and opposition MPs remained in the chamber as the Speaker and Conservative MPs left to go to the House of Lords. The exit of Tories was accompanied by cries of \u201cShame on you!\u201d from those remaining behind, some of whom held up placards saying they were silenced. Renditions of Red Flag, Jerusalem, Flower of Scotland and Bread of Heaven were also sung before Bercow returned to address the remaining MPs, confirm the prorogation and adjourn the Commons. The mood turned turned more festive as MPs filed out, exchanging greetings, witticisms, handshakes and hugs with Bercow as they left.\n\nEarlier there was a parting indignity for Johnson as Labour and other opposition MPs defeated his second attempt to get a general election before 31 October. There cannot now be an election until mid-November at the earliest. MPs also passed a \u201chumble address\u201d ordering Johnson to publish documents detailing the government\u2019s no-deal Brexit plans \u2013 as well as any messages about the suspension of parliament sent by his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, and other aides. On Monday afternoon parliament\u2019s bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit received royal assent and passed into law \u2013 Johnson has insisted, though, that he will not ask for another delay.\n\nIn a further setback for No 10, Bercow has announced he will stand down on 31 October if there is no election before then. This means his immediate successor is likely to be chosen by the current parliament, in which there is no majority for a no-deal Brexit. It also confirms Bercow will still be in post during the crucial fortnight when parliament returns from prorogation in mid-October. The Liberal Democrats have announced they are set to officially back revoking article 50 in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party, effectively severing the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election.\n\nAddiction warning over medications \u2013 Britain is being warned it is risking a US-style opioid crisis through the widespread prescribing of opioid painkillers, benzodiazepines and sleeping pills. Nearly 12 million people \u2013 about one in four adults in England \u2013 are taking medicines that they can find hard to stop, according to a review by Public Health England. \u201cWhile the scale and nature of opioid prescribing does not reflect the so-called crisis in North America, the NHS needs to take action now to protect patients,\u201d said Rosanna O\u2019Connor, one of the report\u2019s authors. GPs should instead consider social prescribing, from talking therapies to joining a choir, says the report, while conceding that long-term use of certain classes of drugs like antidepressants is necessary for some.\n\nCreggan flares up \u2013 Police were attacked with petrol bombs and missiles in Derry\u2019s Creggan estate last night as they carried out searches targeting dissident republicans, the PSNI said. It is the same place where the journalist Lyra McKee, 29, was murdered by the New IRA in April while she observed riots. The searches were launched after a dissident republican mortar bomb was recovered in Strabane, Co Tyrone, on Saturday. It was positioned close to a family home and aimed at the town\u2019s police station, and represents the seventh attempted murder bid against the security forces in Northern Ireland this year.\n\n\u2018Climate apartheid\u2019 \u2013 The world is in a \u201cgravely insufficient\u201d state of readiness for the inevitable severe effects of global heating, according to a report by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA), which is convened by 18 nations including the UK. Trillion-dollar investment is needed to avert \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d, where the rich escape the effects and the poor do not. But this investment is far smaller than the eventual costs and \u201cirrefutable toll on human life\u201d of doing nothing. Separately the National Farmers\u2019 Union is arguing there is no need to cut back beef production or return farmland to forest for the sake of the climate \u2013 instead, UK agricultural emissions could be offset by growing fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide. Social policy group the RSA welcomed the NFU\u2019s \u201cambitious targets\u201d but Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said eating less but better meat was a crucial part of the fight against climate breakdown.\n\n\u2018Life is just too short\u2019 \u2013 An NHS trust boss has quit her post blaming underfunding of the service and the pressures of the job, concluding: \u201cLife is just too short.\u201d Siobhan McArdle announced her resignation as chief executive of the South Tees Hospitals Foundation Trust which runs the James Cook hospital in Middlesbrough, Friarage hospital in Northallerton, and community hospitals in North Yorkshire and the Tees Valley. McArdle said the trust had delivered \u00a3140m in efficiency savings over the last five years and could not tighten its belt any more. Saffron Cordery, CEO of NHS Providers which represents trusts, said: \u201cIn recent years trust leaders have become accustomed to demands for productivity improvements and savings that are increasingly unachievable.\u201d\n\nThe tale continues \u2013 Hundreds of fans have lined up to attend the midnight launch of The Testaments, Margaret Atwood\u2019s much-anticipated sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, attended by the Canadian author herself at Waterstone\u2019s in London\u2019s Piccadilly.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Atwood at the launch of The Testaments.

Plus, Polly Toynbee on why Jeremy Corbyn is preventing Boris Johnson from calling an election.\n\nToday in Focus Siri's privacy problem Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/09/09-64231-190910TIF_apple.mp3 00:00:00 00:23:12\n\nLunchtime read: Inside the North Korean embassy raid\n\nIn February a gang of armed men took a North Korean official hostage at his country\u2019s Madrid embassy and demanded that he defect. The attackers told So Yun-sok they wanted him \u201cto become the ambassador of a new state set up by them \u2013 a \u2018free\u2019 state\u201d.\n\nThe men claimed that \u201cthe North Korean government has very little time left\u201d and said other groups were \u201cgoing to do the same thing\u201d. When So refused, their plan fell apart, and they fled. Who were they, and why did they risk everything on this wild plot?\n\nSport\n\nGareth Southgate has offered support to Declan Rice after the West Ham midfielder revealed he and his family received online threats following his switch in allegiance from the Republic of Ireland to England. In cricket, several problems with the makeup of the England team have become clear during the Ashes series and action is needed to resolve them.\n\nAnne van Dam, the 23-year-old Dutch golfer with the \u201cperfect\u201d swing, has managed to break the mould on her journey from Arnhem to Gleneagles for her Solheim Cup debut. Rafa Nadal has always played in Roger Federer\u2019s long shadow but, as his US Open victory over Daniil Medvedev showed, he is still capable of generating his own light. And the former England cricket captains Geoffrey Boycott and Andrew Strauss have been knighted in Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list for their service to sport.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe pound has clung on to most the gains it made yesterday after figures showed that Britain\u2019s economy grew more than expected in the last quarter. Sterling is at \u00a31.234 this morning, down only very slightly overnight, and is buying \u20ac1.117. On Asian markets, falling factory gate prices in China caused jitters among investors worried about the stagnating economy while the FTSE100 is seen largely flat this morning.\n\nThe papers\n\nBrexit is splashed across all of today\u2019s front pages and we have a full review here \u2013 our customary summary follows. The Guardian carries a large picture of the outgoing Speaker, John Bercow, but reserves its headline for the PM: \u201cSix votes, six defeats as PM loses bid for snap election\u201d. The Times also carries a picture of Bercow under the headline: \u201cMPs stop Johnson from calling October election\u201d. The Telegraph\u2019s headline is \u201cJohnson: I\u2019ll defy law over Brexit extension\u201d, alongside a large picture of Carrie Symons, who will be visiting the Queen at Balmoral this weekend with the PM. The early edition of the FT also carries a picture of Bercow: \u201cSpeaking out: Bercow stands up for Commons as he moves to step down\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Tuesday 10 September 2019. Photograph: Guardian\n\n\u201cBoris blasts Brexit \u2018Yellow Bellies\u2019,\u201d writes the Express, adding \u201cMPs savaged for \u2018outrageous\u2019 excuses over stalling election\u201d. It also has on its front page the PM\u2019s claim that \u201cdefiance of referendum is costing country \u20ac250m a week\u201d. The Mirror focuses on Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours, with \u201cNo shame\u201d, saying \u201cas parliament is suspended over the Brexit crisis, Theresa May has the audacity to reward the bungling advisers who got us in this mess\u201d.\n\nNeither the Sun or the Mail lead on Brexit. Instead their splashes are reserved for the \u201cshock rise in pill addicts as docs prescribe to 11.5m\u201d (The Sun \u2013 which also has a small headline \u201cend of the Berc show\u201d). The Mail has \u201cAt last action to beat pills crisis\u201d, but goes hard on the retiring Speaker in a smaller headline: \u201cEnd of the Bercow Show, the partisan pipsqueak who disgraced his office\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
