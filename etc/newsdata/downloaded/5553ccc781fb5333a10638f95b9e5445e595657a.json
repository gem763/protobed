The team has declined to comment. \u2014 JP Finlay (@JPFinlayNBCS) October 4, 2019\n\nThe videos appear to have originated from a Twitter account with the handle \u201c@bubbachuck757.\u201d The account has since gone private.\n\nIn one video, the man resembling Gruden is seen smoking ... something while talking with a woman outside a bar. At one point, the man in question notices the camera, clearly not amused, while a person off screen repeatedly chants \u201cJay.\u201d The other video simply shows the man sitting on the ground with an unidentified woman in his lap.\n\nIt is not apparent where or when the videos were taken, but Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk reports that they are more than a year old. If it is indeed Gruden in the videos, you have to wonder why they are coming out now, with Gruden on the hot seat.\n\nJay Gruden might have the hottest seat in the NFL right now. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether or not the videos are verified, they represent yet another unflattering storyline for a coach fighting to keep his job, if he hasn\u2019t effectively lost it already. A report emerged last week that Gruden was coaching for his job against the New York Giants. Washington ended up losing that game even after Gruden inserted first-round pick Dwayne Haskins, who threw three interceptions while looking overwhelmed.\n\nGruden already faced an even rougher time in Week 5, when his 0-4 team is scheduled to face the New England Patriots with Colt McCoy starting at quarterback over Haskins.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jay Gruden already had the hottest seat in the NFL thanks to the Redskins' 0-4 start.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wm9vkdR5hnJ3kLRF0cobmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IQ_Lq3W5KAGv_WCDLMMzIQ--~B/aD0yNjQ1O3c9Mzk3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ed3d5cc0-e712-11e9-b3ff-3b1b35989edd", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
