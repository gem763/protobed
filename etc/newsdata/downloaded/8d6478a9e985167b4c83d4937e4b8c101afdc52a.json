REUTERS/Polina Devitt/Files\n\nNickel investors bought heavily into rumours that the Indonesian government was thinking about bringing forward a ban on nickel ore exports.\n\nNow the ban has been confirmed for the start of next year rather than the original 2022 deadline, they have bought some more.\n\nLondon Metal Exchange (LME) three-month nickel hit a five-year high of $18,850 per tonne on Monday with the Shanghai Futures Exchange scaling life-of-contract highs amid surging open interest.\n\nGoldman Sachs added fuel to the bull fires with a forecast that the nickel price could spike to $20,000 over three months.\n\nAn Indonesian export ban could impact up to 10% of global supply, according to the bank.\n\nThat analysis comes with multiple moving parts, not least Indonesia\u2019s own recent history of policy U-turns on the question of its nickel exports.\n\nWhile some sort of supply disruption is guaranteed, there is a lot of speculative heat in the sizzling nickel market right now, meaning more price volatility is also guaranteed.\n\nINDONESIA BANS ORE EXPORTS, AGAIN\n\nThe nickel market has been here before.\n\nIndonesia banned all exports of nickel ore at the start of 2014 before allowing a partial resumption by operators who could prove they were working on building processing capacity.\n\nThe compromise was due to run until 2022 but the country\u2019s government has accelerated the timetable with a full ban now due at the start of 2020.\n\nGiven the policy chop-and-change since 2014, it\u2019s by no means certain that things won\u2019t change again, particularly if the loss of export earnings starts impacting some of the processing projects already underway.\n\nBut assuming the ban holds, there will be an undoubted short-term hit on supply, given Indonesia accounts for around a quarter of global mine supply.\n\nThe question is to what extent and how quickly supply chains can adapt to compensate for the loss of Indonesian ore exports.\n\nALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES\n\nThe big winner from the original Indonesian ban was the Philippines, which boosted its exports of nickel ore to China.\n\nIt remains a key alternative supplier to China\u2019s nickel pig iron (NPI) sector and in volume terms shipments now run at almost double the rate of Indonesian flows.\n\nThere is some potential for the Philippines to lift output again, although the country\u2019s nickel miners have been constrained by tightening environmental rules on their operations.\n\nThe problem, though, is that ore from the Philippines tends to be lower grade than that from Indonesia, which affects NPI producers\u2019 ability to achieve the purity mix needed for stainless steel production.\n\nMore significant as an alternative supplier is Indonesia itself.\n\nThe logic underpinning Indonesia\u2019s ore policy is the development of a domestic processing industry.\n\nIt has already been successful, most notably with China Tsingshan Group\u2019s ramp up of both NPI and stainless steel capacity in the country.\n\nOthers have moved only as far as first-stage processing, turning ore into NPI for onward shipment to China.\n\nSuch exports have grown to become a significant source of supply for China\u2019s stainless steel producers, albeit one that is sometimes difficult to quantify given China\u2019s customs department classifies Indonesian NPI as \u201cferro-nickel\u201d.\n\nThe give-away clue is the lower value of Indonesian \u201cferro-nickel\u201d imports relative to other suppliers. The average implied value of imported Indonesian material was $1,740 per tonne in July compared with in excess of $4,000 for producers such as Brazil or Colombia.\n\nTotal \u201cferro-nickel\u201d imports from Indonesia were just 7,200 tonnes in 2014, the year when the ore ban was first introduced.\n\nThey have been running at an annualised 1.2 million tonnes over the last three months.\n\nEvidently, there is plenty of potential for these exports to rise if Indonesian miners accelerate the building of processing capacity as is clearly the aim of the new, fast-track ban.\n\nIndonesia currently has 11 operating processing plants with 25 more in the pipeline, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.\n\nIndeed, energy and minerals consultants Wood Mackenzie forecast that by 2021, Indonesian NPI output will surpass China\u2019s, which is estimated at 570,000 tonnes this year.\n\nOVERHEATING?\n\nEven allowing for more Philippines exports and greater volumes of Indonesian NPI, the supply chain is going to be sorely tested once the ban kicks in next year.\n\nAnalysts are revisiting their forecasts with most now penciling in a global supply deficit both next year and in 2021.\n\nThis is the core story underpinning nickel\u2019s stellar rally but it\u2019s worth remembering that nickel has been trading the Indonesian rumours for several months now.\n\nNews of the ban, if it can be called news at all, should in theory be almost totally priced in at current levels.\n\nBut markets are rarely so rational when gripped by the sort of speculative fever currently animating nickel.\n\nShanghai nickel has seen an unprecedented build in open interest on the latest leg of the rally, suggesting a mass stampede by speculators into an already hot market.\n\nLME broker Marex Spectron estimates the speculative long in London at around 22% of open interest, not yet at levels seen in June 2018, when it reached 34% of open interest, but still substantial.\n\nExtra spice to an already heady bull cocktail comes in the form of a tightening in the LME spread structure.\n\nThe benchmark cash-to-three-months time spread was trading in comfortable $90-per tonne contango as recently as the start of July. As of Friday\u2019s close it was valued at a backwardation of $104 per tonne.\n\nThe spread has eased somewhat over the last 24 hours but cash metal is still at a significant level to forward prices, acting as a deterrent to would-be short sellers.\n\nNickel, in other words, finds itself in a perfect bull storm, which is why it has deviated so sharply from the rest of the LME base metals suite.\n\nBut can it simply keep on rallying now that there is no more Indonesian \u201cnews\u201d to trade?\n\nEven Goldman\u2019s analysts caution they are expecting the price to retrace to $16,000 over a 12-month time-frame as supply adapts to the Indonesian ban.\n\nWhatever happens, it\u2019s not going to be a smooth ride.
