The people there are still suffering under the yoke of their dictator, Nicolas Maduro. While much of the world (including the United States) has recognized National Assembly leader Juan Guaido as interim president, Maduro remains in charge of the military and most of the power structure in that nation.\n\nNow, however, Guaido is getting a financial shot in the arm from the United States. And it\u2019s no small matter either. USAID has pledged to deliver $98M in aid to the Guaido administration, such as it is. (Miami Herald)\n\nWashington on Tuesday pledged an additional $98 million in aid to Venezuela, saying the funds will be used to support civil society, human rights organizations and independent media. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) signed what it called a \u201chistoric bilateral agreement\u201d with representatives of Venezuela\u2019s Juan Guaid\u00f3 administration. Guaid\u00f3, the head of Venezuela\u2019s congress, is recognized by the United States and more than 50 other nations as the country\u2019s legitimate interim president. But Nicol\u00e1s Maduro still holds many of the levers of power in the country.\n\nThis is a tricky situation. We clearly want to provide some help to the people of Venezuela who are severely lacking in food, potable water and basic medical supplies. But Maduro, his government and most of his associates are under heavy sanctions. We can\u2019t just transfer money to some government account in a Venezuelan bank because Maduro would be able to immediately seize it.\n\nThe solution that was arrived upon has the money taking a more roundabout route. Rather than handing it directly over, the cash will go to a number of international aid organizations working in Venezuela under the direction of Juan Guaido. That should at least assure that most of the help will go where it\u2019s needed.\n\nOf course, the reality here is that this is mostly a symbolic gesture of support for Guaido. There was already nothing stopping USAID from sending money to the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders or any of the other humanitarian aid groups working inside that country. But tying the interim president\u2019s name to it and involving him in the process is another way of undermining the authority of Nicolas Maduro and propping up the appearance of Guaido as being the person in charge.\n\nWill this hasten Maduro\u2019s exit from power? Probably not. As long as he retains control of the military and the backing of Russia, China and Turkey, he can probably hang around for quite a while. But if this aid money actually makes it out onto the streets and helps alleviate the plight of Venezuela\u2019s starving citizens, some good will have come of it.", "description": "Follow the money", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Guaido-Lopez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
