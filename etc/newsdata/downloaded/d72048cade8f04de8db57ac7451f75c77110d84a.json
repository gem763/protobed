He hit 642 out of 649 attempts, which was good for 98.9 percent. This season, he's just 10-for-14, tallying more than half the misses in three games than he's had in his entire career.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"Obviously, I've hit a little bit of a skid here,\" Gostkowski told reporters after the Patriots' 30-14 win over the Jets. \"It can be frustrating at times, but I'm just glad that I'm on a team that we're winning and it's not really hurting anybody.\"\n\nSome may think that it's time for the Patriots to think about their next kicker. While the team has been fortunate to only have two kickers since 1996, it's common for teams to cycle through kickers every few years if their current player shows signs of inconsistency.\n\nIn this case, the grass may not be greener. Here's a look at free agent kickers who played in the NFL last season but find themselves without a home right now.\n\nCody Parkey: 83.9 career FG percentage\n\nBlair Walsh: 82.4\n\nSebastian Janikowski: 80.4\n\nPhil Dawson: 83.8\n\nMike Nugent: 81.4\n\nChandler Catanzaro: 83.8\n\nKai Forbath: 85.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nGostkowski's career field goal percentage (87.324) is good for third all-time behind Justin Tucker and Robbie Gould. So while Gostkowski's extra point struggles may be frustrating right now, the kickers available right now have not proved to be more reliable than him. Not to mention Parkey and Walsh have two of the most infamous misses in NFL history. There's usually a reason a kicker is a free agent this far into a regular season.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
