But it's just the beginning for Senate candidate John Hickenlooper. The former Colorado governor gave it his best shot but never exceeded an average of 1 percent national support in his 2020 campaign. The press repeatedly asked him why he was running for the White House and not the Senate, where he could be much more influential, but he insisted Congress wasn't for him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not cut out to be a senator,\u201d Hickenlooper said in February. \u201cSenators don\u2019t build teams. Senators sit and debate in small groups, which is important, right? But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s my \u2014 I\u2019m a doer. That\u2019s what gives me joy.\u201d\n\nHe still held that sentiment in May, telling MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that he's the person who \"can bring people together and really get done the big, progressive things that people say can't get done.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Hickenlooper officially declared he had changed his mind.\n\nI\u2019ve always said Washington is a lousy place for a guy like me who knows how to get things done. But this is no time to walk away. Changing DC is hard, but I\u2019m not done fighting for the people of Colorado. I'm running for U.S. Senate.

Jay Inslee also announced that he's withdrawing from the White House race during his appearance on Maddow's show last night. But he's still going to be fighting climate change, his No. 1 issue.\n\n\"It's become clear that I'm not going to be carrying the ball,\" he admitted. \"I'm not going to be the president, so I'm withdrawing tonight from the race.\"\n\nThat makes three candidates who have now called it quits. But there are still plenty where they came from.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:09:49AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/234/b3bbbf58-756d-47a5-9117-0369844e3e1a.png"}
