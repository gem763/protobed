Smith, who had been at Fox News since its inception \u2014 and who had become one of the few voices on the network to disagree with Fox\u2019s pro-Donald Trump commentators \u2014 had been serving the network's chief news anchor, managing editor of the network's breaking news unit and anchor of Shepard Smith Reporting.\n\n\"Recently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter,\" Smith said in a statement on Friday afternoon. \"After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u2019m proud to have anchored their work each day \u2014 I will deeply miss them.\"\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 17: (EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE) Jane Skinner visits \"Shepard Smith Reporting\" at Fox News Channel Studios on September 17, 2019 in New York City.

We are proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed at Fox News, along with everything he accomplished here during his monumental 23-year tenure. While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network.\"\n\nSmith was one of the original team hired by Fox News in 1996. He began hosting his daytime show Shepard Smith Reporting in 2002.\n\nFriday's episode of Shepard Smith Reporting was Smith\u2019s final show at the network. Fox News announced a series of rotating anchors will host the 3 p.m. ET time slot until a new dayside news program is announced.\n\nFNC\u2019s business anchor Neil Cavuto reacted to the news in real time. \"Whoa,\" he said at the top of his show. \"I'm Neil Cavuto and, like you, I'm a little stunned and a little heartbroken. I don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"A decent human being ... a better newsman you probably cannot find,\" Cavuto continued. \"A bigger, more emotionally connected to human kind you cannot find. So Shepard, I don\u2019t know what the heck you\u2019re planning to do or where you go, but I just know you\u2019ll be great at doing it, and you deserve the best that life has to offer. So, I'm sorry if I'm a little shellshocked here, but I'm going to miss my buddy.\"\n\nFox News Channel\u2019s chief White House correspondent John Roberts added on Cavuto's program, \"I\u2019m just trying to compile my thoughts too, Neil. I walked out here to do the hit and suddenly got hit by a subway train. Holy mackerel.\"\n\nBrett Baier, the network\u2019s chief political anchor, tweeted his shock, adding, \"I wish him well in whatever lies ahead.\"\n\nToday brought about a little shock for us here at #FoxNews as our colleague Shepard Smith announced it would be his last broadcast.

It was a total shock today to find out he\u2019s leaving. He anchored breaking news -fast-moving events \u2014better than anyone. I wish him well in whatever lies ahead \u2014 Bret Baier (@BretBaier) October 11, 2019\n\nSmith won't be heading to a rival network anytime soon.
