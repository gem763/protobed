Hopefully with a better outcome than that last time Spider-Man sang. Per Deadline, Andrew Garfield will star in Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s forthcoming movie adaptation of the pretty-much autobiographical 1990 Jonathan Larson musical Tick, Tick \u2026 Boom!, as was previously rumored when the project went to Netflix. The show follows a young theater composer named Jon as he worries about his 30th birthday (Garfield is 36, but a well-moisturized 36 in 2019 is pretty much a 29 in the \u201990s) and worries about his relationships and death a lot. Larson, of course, went on to write Rent, but died before that megahit\u2019s first Off Broadway performance. As for Garfield, aside from a few awkward interview clips, we\u2019re not sure if he can really sing. Soon, we\u2019ll all find out about that together.", "description": "Andrew Garfield will star in an upcoming Netflix adaptation of Jonathan Larson\u2019s \u201cTick, Tick\u2026 Boom!\u201d directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/30/30-andrew-garfield.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
