Specifically, we forced the release of 145 pages of Rosenstein\u2019s communications that include a one-line email from Rosenstein to Mueller stating, \u201cThe boss and his staff do not know about our discussions.\u201d They also include \u201coff the record\u201d emails with major media outlets around the date of Mueller\u2019s appointment.\n\nWe filed a lawsuit to get these documents after the Department of Justice failed to respond to our September 21, 2018, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:19-cv-00481)).\n\nWe were seeking any and all e-mails, text messages, or other records of communication addressed to or received by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein between May 8, 2017, and May 22, 2017.\n\nThe time period referred to in this suit is critical. On May 9, 2017, Rosenstein wrote a memo to President Trump recommending that FBI Director James Comey be fired. That day, President Trump fired Comey. Just three days later, on May 12, Rosenstein sent an email assuring Robert Mueller that \u201cThe boss and his staff do not know about our discussions.\u201d (It is not clear if the \u201cboss\u201d is then-AG Sessions or President Trump.)\n\nIn a May 16, 2017, email, sent the day before Mueller\u2019s appointment, Rosenstein emailed former Bush administration Deputy Attorney General and current Kirkland & Ellis Partner Mark Filip stating, \u201cI am with Mueller. He shares my views. Duty Calls. Sometimes the moment chooses us.\u201d\n\nThe next day, May 17, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDuring the same period, between May 8 and May 17, Rosenstein met with then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and other senior Justice Department FBI officials to discuss wearing a wire and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump.\n\nThe documents also show that, again during the same time period, Rod Rosenstein was in direct communication with reporters from 60 Minutes, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. In an email exchange dated May 2017, Rosenstein communicated with New York Times reporter Rebecca Ruiz to provide background for this article about himself. Ruiz emailed Rosenstein a draft of the article, and he responded with off-the-record comments and clarifications.\n\nIn an email exchange on May 17, 2017, the day of Mueller\u2019s appointment, Rosenstein exchanged emails with 60 Minutes producer Katherine Davis in which he answered off-the-record questions about Mueller\u2019s scope of authority and chain of command:\n\nRosenstein: \u201cOff the record: This special counsel is a DOJ employee. His status is similar to a US Attorney.\u201d\n\nDavis: \u201cGood call on Mueller. Although I obviously thought you\u2019d be great at leading the investigation too.\u201d\n\nOn May 17, 2017, in an email exchange with Washington Post journalist Sari Horwitz with the subject line \u201cSpecial Counsel,\u201d Rosenstein and Horwitz exchanged:\n\nRosenstein said, \u201cAt some point, I owe you a long story. But this is not the right time for me to talk to anybody.\u201d\n\nHorwitz: \u201cNow, I see why you couldn\u2019t talk today! Obviously, we\u2019re writing a big story about this Is there any chance I could talk to you on background about your decision?\u201d\n\nThese astonishing emails further confirm the corruption behind Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Robert Mueller. They also show a shockingly cozy relationship between Mr. Rosenstein and anti-Trump media reporters.\n\nHere\u2019s some more background on the incredible finds from this one Judicial Watch lawsuit.\n\nOn September 11, we released 14 pages of records from the Department of Justice showing officials\u2019 efforts in responding to media inquiries about DOJ/FBI talks allegedly invoking the 25th Amendment to \u201cremove\u201d President Donald Trump from office and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein offering to wear a \u201cwire\u201d to record his conversations with the president.\n\nOn September 23, we released a two-page memo, dated May 16, 2017, by then-Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe detailing how then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein proposed wearing a wire into the Oval Office \u201cto collect additional evidence on the president\u2019s true intentions.\u201d McCabe writes that Rosenstein said he thought it was possible because \u201che was not searched when he entered the White House.\u201d\n\nAs the \u201ccoup\u201d targeting President Trump continues through the House impeachment abuse, it is important to remember that its origins are in the Deep State agencies \u2013 especially the FBI and DOJ.", "description": "Rod Rosenstein, former deputy attorney general, is a key figure in enabling the Deep State\u2019s seditious attacks on President Trump.", "authors": ["Tom Fitton"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/wi/ap/16/18pcfq_trump-russia-probe-42681-rod-rosenstein-deputy-attorney-rod-rosenstein.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
