So it\u2019s a real honour to be here with you today.\u2019\n\nRemaining notoriously tight-lipped, the anchorwoman didn\u2019t comment on the row, but simply thanked Al-Kadhi \u2018for your thoughts\u2019.\n\nMunchetty was originally ruled to have broken BBC guidelines by commenting on the US President\u2019s tweets on July 17, but after widespread criticism from the public and her peers (including even Piers Morgan) the decision was reversed by the channel\u2019s Director-General, Tony Hall.\n\nNaga fired back at Donald\u2019 Trump\u2019s tweet telling his opponents to \u2018go back home\u2019 (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think Naga\u2019s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made,\u2019 he told staff after backtracking on the ruling.\n\nWe haven\u2019t had a direct response from the presenter about the row or its backlash yet, but she certainly looked happy after posting a picture to social media after it was announced she would be returning to work.\n\nIf you want to catch up with all the controversy, we\u2019ve compiled a handy guide explaining exactly what went on and why the BBC reversed its initial decision.\n\nBBC Breakfast airs weekdays from 6am on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
