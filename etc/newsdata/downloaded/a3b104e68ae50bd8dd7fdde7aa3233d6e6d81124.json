Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSchwartzman had not been on court for more than two hours in any of his previous matches and the number 20 seed was by far the fresher of the pair on a rainy day at Flushing Meadows, seeing off a weary Zverev in just over three hours.\n\nIt was Labor Day in the United States and Zverev, who had seen every one of his matches go to four sets or more, made hard work of his fourth round contest, committing 17 double faults.\n\nThe fatal mistake, however, came in the fourth set with Schwartzman up 4-2 and Zverev fighting to stay in the match when the German was slapped with a point penalty after directing an obscenity at his box that gave the Argentina a 5-2 lead.\n\nThe 22-year-old had earlier been given a warning for slamming the ball into the crowd.\n\n\u201cI mean, code violation is fine,\u201d said Zverev. \u201cHe said he gave me a warning before. I didn\u2019t hear it. Diego didn\u2019t hear it. Most of the crowd didn\u2019t hear it.\n\n\u201cI think the umpires next time should let me know about it.\u201d\n\nRACKET TALK\n\nZverev was a bit sheepish about the incident, explaining that he believed the up and coming young players needed to shut their mouths and let their play do the talking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young guys that do things on the tennis court that maybe is not the best thing to do,\u201d said Zverev. \u201cI don\u2019t want the next generation to be known for that.\n\n\u201cLet your tennis racket talk for you kind of.\n\n\u201cI hope some of the NextGen will kind of learn from the older guys like Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal) who have been unbelievable over their career, really let their racket talk for them, not try to distract opponents, something like that.\u201d\n\nRegarded as an emerging talent and potential threat to the domination of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic, Zverev has so far failed to meet expectations, especially at Grand Slams where he has never been beyond the quarter-finals.\n\nFor Schwartzman the win was just his sixth in 28 attempts against a top-10 opponent, sending him through to the last eight at a major tournament for only the third time.\n\nSchwartzman, who cruised into the fourth round without dropping a set, saw that run end quickly when Zverev grabbed the opener despite six double faults.\n\nThe Argentine had begun smartly with the early break to go up 2-0 only to have Zverev sweep the next five games on the way to taking the first set.\n\nSept 2, 2019; Flushing, NY, USA; Alexander Zverev of Germany cursing while playing Diego Schwartzman of Argentina in the fourth round on day eight of the 2019 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe second began the same way with Schwartzman snatching the early break but this time he did not squander the advantage, breaking the misfiring German twice more to level the contest.\n\nZverev had the first break in the third set but Schwartzman had the last by breaking the German at 5-4 to lead the match.\n\nSchwartzman took a stranglehold on the contest by racing to a 4-0 lead then, after a brief fight back from Zverev, finished off his opponent on his second match point with a stinging forehand winner.", "description": "Argentina's Diego Schwartzman dispatched a misfiring Alexander Zverev 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-3 to reach the U.S. Open quarter-finals on Monday after heaping more Grand Slam misery on the sixth-seeded German.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425531925&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811M0"}
