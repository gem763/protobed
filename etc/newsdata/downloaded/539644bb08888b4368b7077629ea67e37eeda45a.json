But sales have dwindled there ever since.\n\nThe new investment Hyundai announced is 1.6 times larger than the money it spent over the last five years, so the money for R&D has effectively doubled.\n\nThe spending plan is even more remarkable since Hyundai\u2019s operating profit fell from W8 trillion from 2011 to 2013 to W2.4 trillion last year.\n\n\"The automotive industry is experiencing a major transformation which hasn't been seen in a century and we can't afford to push back investment in future growth,\" a company spokesman said.\n\nOut of the W35 trillion in R&D spending earmarked over the next five years, Hyundai plans to spend W14.7 trillion on self-driving car technology. Another W20.3 trillion will be spent on developing new SUVs and premium sedans, which fetch higher margins, as well as cutting-edge engines.\n\nThe automaker also plans to expand sales in Southeast Asia and other new markets, while clawing back market share in China and the U.S.", "description": "Hyundai to Make Massive Investment in R&D", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/02/28/2019022801507_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-28"}
