The star trails in the image centred around a point in the left hand corner as this was the point perpendicular to the ISS orbital plane\n\nFires in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola were also captured as thin orange lines in the incredibly versatile photo.\n\nAnother display of nature's power was seen in thunderstorms which appear as circular white-blue flashes above the land.\n\nAnd the image even shows the Earth's 'airglow', which is an emission of yellow-green light produced by the globe's atmosphere.\n\nThe airglow stretches between 50 and 400miles (80-645km) into the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nExplaining why the star trails in the image centred around a point in the left hand corner Matthew Osvog, of NASA Johnson Space Center's ISS Flight Operations Pointing Console, said: 'This point is essentially normal (perpendicular) to the ISS orbital plane, directly out of the port side of the vehicle based on the spacecraft silhouettes.\n\n'The stars close to this perpendicular vector (near the upper left) appear stationary during the short duration of the time-lapse sequence.\n\n'While stars with increasing angular distance (further away from the normal vector) trace out large circles as the ISS rotates in inertial space and while orbiting the Earth.\n\n'As seen in this composite image, the star trails eventually get large enough to dip behind Earth's limb.'\n\nAstronauts Jessica Meir, left, and Christina Koch pose for a photo in the International Space Station after taking part in the first ever all-female spacewalk - mischaracterized by Trump as the first female spacewalk at all\n\nNASA astronauts Christina Koch (pictured) and Jessica Meir have shared a gallery of selfies that are out-of-this-world. The pair snapped 'space-selfies' while changing a failed battery charge-discharge unit on the International Space Station with a spare\n\nOn Friday, October 18th, Koch and Meir (pictured) ventured outside of the International Space Station (ISS) at 07:38am ET (12:38pm BST) to begin the first all-female spacewalk ever. The selfies show the pair fixing parts of the ISS and floating weightless in space\n\nDuring Dr Koch's time on the ISS \u2013 she has been there for eight months \u2013 she has taken part in several spacewalks, including the first all-woman walk.\n\nAfter the walk on Friday, October 18, NASA astronauts Dr Koch and her colleague Jessica Meir shared a gallery of selfies from the walk.\n\nThe pair snapped the space selfies while changing a failed battery charge-discharge unit on the exterior of the International Space Station.\n\nKoch and Meir spent a total of seven hours and 17 minutes outside of the craft, which will go down in history as the first all-woman spacewalk in history.", "description": "Stunning circular star trails can be seen in the sky while light sources from earth including major cities appear as pale-yellow dotted streaks.
