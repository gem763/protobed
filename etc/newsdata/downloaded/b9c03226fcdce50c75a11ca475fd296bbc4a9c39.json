For one thing, long-term demographic changes make it likely that Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland, most of whom identify as Irish nationalists, will soon become the largest religious group in the statelet, which was crafted in 1921 specifically to have a pro-British Protestant majority. And sentiment appears to be moving in that direction: Last month, for the first time, a survey found that a majority in Northern Ireland in favor of reunifying, albeit only by a margin of 51\u201349. (The poll was, notably, carried out by a company owned by Michael Ashcroft, a former senior official in Britain\u2019s Conservative Party, which is officially unionist.)\n\nRead: Brexit and Britain\u2019s Northern Ireland d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\nThe notion has become so mainstream, in fact, that Peter Robinson\u2014a former leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) whose dedication to preserving Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the U.K. once led him to co-found an armed paramilitary group\u2014publicly stated last year that unionists like him would be wise to start planning for a vote, and to be prepared to respect the result. \u201cI don\u2019t expect my own house to burn down,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I still insure it because it could happen.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to overstate what a remarkable shift this is. And yet, at the same time, it is difficult to understate how ill-prepared everyone is for it to actually happen.\n\nHow, practically, would Ireland be reunited? What flag would fly over which buildings? Would residents of Northern Ireland still be able to claim both British and Irish nationality? Would a united Ireland be a unitary state under Dublin\u2019s present structure, reversing (or, some nationalists might say, avenging) Britain\u2019s partition of the island almost a century ago, or would it be a newly federal country, with the north retaining its separate parliament, police, and administration and London standing as guarantor of the interests of Northern Ireland\u2019s unionist population, as Dublin has stood for Northern Irish nationalists?\n\nSuch questions are already being debated quietly in many unofficial forums and back rooms, yet neither Dublin nor London is involved. The British government is consumed by Brexit, while Ireland says its priority is to protect the Good Friday Agreement (\u201cThe Irish government very firmly does not see Brexit as a vehicle for achieving a united Ireland\u2014they are separate and distinct issues,\u201d a government spokesman said). Even the Northern Irish assembly and executive, which have an array of their own powers, have been suspended for the past three years because of a standoff between the DUP and Sinn Fein, the main nationalist party. As far as is known, no unionist politician has yet joined any of these private conversations about Irish unity. And even those who are prepared to at least consider the possibility remain deeply skeptical, not only of arguments about identity and sovereignty, but of the practical benefits as well.", "description": "Changing demographics and sentiment signal that the possibility of a reunion is increasing.
