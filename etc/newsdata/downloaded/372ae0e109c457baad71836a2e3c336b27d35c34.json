Actually this is not as black and white as it seems | Marina Hyde Read more\n\n\u201cThere were four or five people making the chants,\u201d said Mihaylov during the press conference and with his resignation having first been reported on Tuesday. \u201cThe second time the match was stopped only England manager Gareth Southgate had heard them.\n\n\u201cWe did what we had to do regarding the security during the game versus England. Bulgaria is not a racist country. And my decision to step down has nothing to do with prime minister [Boyko] Borissov asking for my resignation the day after the game. My patience is over.\u201d\n\nBalakov came under criticism after claiming he could not hear any of the racist abuse that took place at Stadion Vasil Levski. Step one of Uefa\u2019s anti-racism protocol was activated just before the half-hour mark, with the referee asking for a public address announcement to be made ordering the abuse to stop. However, it continued and although there was a short stoppage just before half-time, the game was completed.\n\nBalakov later issued a statement making a \u201csincere apology\u201d to the England team and anyone else offended by the racist abuse but it was not enough to save the 53-year-old\u2019s job.\n\n\u201cI am no longer a national team coach and I wish success to the next coach. The situation is not rosy,\u201d Balakov said in quotes reported by sportal.bg. \u201cI\u2019m a professional and I know there are times like this in my life. I will look for my next chance. I will rest now.\u201d\n\nThe BFU announced Mihail Kasabov had taken the presidency on a temporary basis, after vice-presidents Yordan Lechkov and Atanas Furnadzhiev had declined to take it on. Kasabov will need to organise an extraordinary congress to elect a new executive committee.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Krasimir Balakov during the Euro 2020 qualifier.
