We couldn\u2019t have been more shocked. It felt like being hit by a train.\u201d\n\nThe sudden death of their \u00adbeautiful little boy left his parents heartbroken \u2013 but desperate to do something to ensure Oscar\u2019s memory lived on.\n\nWhile still raw with grief, the couple \u2013 who have three other \u00adchildren, Holly, nine, Barney, four, and Leo, 21 months \u2013 founded the charity Thinking Of Oscar, which aims to help other families in the same harrowing situation.\n\n(Image: James Cole Photography)\n\nHannah explains: \u201cIt started off completely unashamedly that we wanted to carry on talking about Oscar, but you know instinctively that if you\u2019re doing stuff to help others it makes you feel better.\n\n\"We wanted to turn something completely catastrophic into something positive.\u201d\n\nHannah and David, who live in Kirtlington in the Cotswolds, both worked in the IT software sector, so decided to use their expertise in technology to help youngsters who find themselves in hospital.\n\n\u201cMost bereaved parents would go and solve the problem that affected their family, but we couldn\u2019t do that because what happened to Oscar was so unlikely,\u201d says David, 39.\n\nHe reveals that only 5% of NHS budgets go on under-18s, even though this group represents 20% of the population.\n\nHannah adds: \u201cBecause we both come from a tech background, we are really interested in the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform industries, and healthcare is absolutely ripe for that.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s super-exciting to think, \u2018What if you can invest in AI to accelerate diagnosis or deploy digital technologies so that a child\u2019s experience whilst in hospital is less stressful?\u2019\n\n\u201cFor example, how you distract an 18-month-old who is scared of needles could be by blowing bubbles, which costs 30p, but\n\nhow you distract a 13-year-old could be through using augmented virtual reality.\u201d\n\n(Image: James Cole Photography)\n\nTheir time in the children\u2019s unit gave the couple an insight into where help was most needed.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate in one way, in that Oscar did not spend a lot of time in hospital, but we could see an opportunity to make time spent in hospital a lot better,\u201d says David.\n\n\u201cOscar had to have a lot of blood tests. It\u2019s not a nice thing to see your child go through.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to see a vein on an adult hand, but not very easy to see one on a stocky 18-month-old.\n\n\u201cOnce they\u2019ve used a vein, they can\u2019t use that same vein for a certain period of time. They will literally shave a child\u2019s hair to try to get in through the temple.\u201d\n\nThis inspired the charity to invest in vein-finder \u00adtechnology, which assists doctors in finding a viable vein for children who require many blood tests and injections.\n\nAn infra-red light \u00adilluminates veins. The technology means doctors can find a vein first time, rather than having to try repeatedly, which causes distress for both the child and parents.\n\n(Image: James Cole Photography)\n\nThinking of Oscar has already given assistance to hospitals in Manchester, Birmingham, Oxford and Sheffield.\n\nThe charity also invested in an app for children with cancer, created by the father of a teenager who had the disease.\n\n\u201cEveryone was talking to her parents, but she was old enough and competent enough to understand,\u201d explains David.\n\n\u201cThe app empowers children to make decisions or at least understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nIt is also funding research into an ultrasound system for children who have holes in their intestines, as well as a separate fellowship at Oxford Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nThe charity marked its fifth \u00adanniversary earlier this year with a 500-mile fundraising cycle ride.\n\nThe five-day event stopped at the children\u2019s hospitals the charity supports, helping them hit \u00a3120,000 of their \u00a3500,000 target.\n\nWhile nothing can bring Oscar back, his charity means that every day families around the country will be benefitting from medical advances made in his name.", "description": "Oscar had contracted encephalitis, a rare condition that causes \u00adinflammation of the brain and died at the Oxford \u00adChildren\u2019s Hospital", "authors": ["Tom Parry", "Image", "James Cole Photography"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743829.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_IMG_0054JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
