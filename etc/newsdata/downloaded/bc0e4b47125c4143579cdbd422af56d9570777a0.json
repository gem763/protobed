And the answers often surprise.\n\n\u201cThe idea Elizabeth Warren is unelectable has followed her her whole career,\u201d said Colin Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who worked against Warren when she was a first-time Senate candidate in 2012. \u201cAnd she has overcome it each time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone views with her the same level of wariness I do,\u201d Reed added. \u201cBut people are definitely watching her rise and taking notice.\u201d\n\nReed\u2019s view isn\u2019t unique, even within the GOP, while some Democrats are far more skeptical.\n\nIndeed, Warren\u2019s electability has become something of a Rorschach test for political operatives. Some see an uber-liberal senator from Massachusetts with a weak electoral track record, while others see the Democratic Party\u2019s most talented campaigner who can tap into the country\u2019s populist energy like few others.\n\nThat striking ambivalence within the political community, in fact, can sometimes also exist within the same operative. One Democratic strategist, for example, said he was impressed by the effectiveness of Warren\u2019s campaign and dismissed most of the concerns about her perceived electoral weaknesses, adding that he might vote for her in the primary.\n\nBut, a moment later, the same strategist acknowledged that her support for single-payer health care scared the \u201cshit\u201d out of him.\n\n\u201cLook, she\u2019d be the total package if not for Medicare for All,\u201d said the Democratic strategist, who like many interviewed for this story, requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cIf there was a Medicare option, I think everybody would be ready to get their saddles and be ready to go.\u201d\n\nDebates about electability aren\u2019t new, of course, especially among Democratic voters, many of whom consider a candidate\u2019s ability to defeat Trump a top priority. But among campaign strategists, the debate is different.\n\nFor one, none of those interviewed for this story volunteered that they thought Warren\u2019s gender would be a hindrance to winning the White House \u2014 unlike some voters.\n\nConcerns over Warren\u2019s admission that she once identified as Native American, a controversy cited frequently by Trump, have also lessened. One Democratic pollster estimated that in recent focus groups he\u2019s seen, just one out of every 10 participants will mention the heritage controversy \u2014 compared to about three in 10 earlier in the year.\n\nStill, some anti-Trump operatives said they worried Warren\u2019s appeal was concentrated among white liberal voters who were always going to vote for the Democratic nominee. Her ability to inspire African-American voters, for example, a group she has yet to win over in large numbers in the primary, remains unclear.\n\nAnd even if the big crowds who show up to her rallies are generally a good sign for her candidacy in the primary, those voters are not necessarily the kind she\u2019d need to win a battleground state like Pennsylvania or Wisconsin in a general election.\n\n\u201cThe question is, are any of those people Obama-Trump voters?\u201d said Tim Miller, a longtime Republican operative who opposes Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are other candidates that I think would certainly be stronger and certainly be weaker,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd for her, I\u2019m unclear at this point.\u201d\n\nMost Democrats who spoke positively of Warren were quick to add that they had a far different view of her electability at the start of the race, when they saw her as more of a Harvard professor than a charismatic campaigner. That began to change as the primary has worn on, thanks to the senator\u2019s ability to combine her humble upbringing with detailed policy plans.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of Democrats \u2014 myself included, frankly \u2014 underestimated Warren\u2019s ability to generate broad-based appeal,\u201d said Jesse Lehrich, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThey have run an incredibly disciplined and deliberate campaign, and it\u2019s remarkable how much Warren has improved as a communicator since her first Senate race.\u201d\n\nThat growing appreciation for her talent, Democrats say, is part of the reason her candidacy fosters such a electability debate. Other leading candidates like Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are also the subject of heated arguments over electability.\n\nRepublicans and Democratic operatives also wonder what Warren\u2019s message would look like in a general election, suggesting her criticism of Trump could be tailored to appeal to a large audience of swing voters \u2014 especially if it centers on the president\u2019s alleged corruption.\n\nStill, others warn that if Warren reverses course in the general election and begins holding high-dollar fundraisers, the resulting political fallout will be severe. Warren is skipping the traditional fundraising circuit during the primary but has said she won\u2019t \u201cunilaterally disarm\u201d against Trump in a general election.\n\nWarren leads Trump in nearly every poll of a hypothetical matchup between the two, though her advantage much smaller than Biden\u2019s. Pollsters say down-ballot House and Senate campaigns have begun testing Warren\u2019s standing in their district on their own, as they begin to assess the political climate ahead of their own election next year. (The pollsters added that congressional candidates are also testing other frontrunners like Biden.)\n\nFor many Democrats, Warren\u2019s strengths and weaknesses as a candidate are so striking that it would be easy to take either side in an argument. Some even suggest her candidacy has opened an inter-generational split within the party over what a successful candidate looks like.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be Democrats if we didn\u2019t live in our anxieties,\u201d said one Democratic strategist. \u201cI think for the older generation, who remember [Michael] Dukakis, they see Warren and worry about her policies turning off who she needs to win. For the younger generation, coming off Hillary [Clinton], they see Biden and worry about his personality not activating who he needs to win.\u201d", "description": "Elizabeth Warren has risen to the top of the 2020 presidential primary alongside Joe Biden.
