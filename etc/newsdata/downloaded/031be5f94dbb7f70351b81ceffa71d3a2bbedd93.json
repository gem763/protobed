(Kosgei was also wearing a prototype of the shoes during her Chicago Marathon win.)\n\nAD\n\nThe sub-two-hour marathon time was part of the INEOS 1:59, a special speed challenge put on by the British chemical company of the same name.\n\nTo be a records-eligible course the race must adhere to stricter rules around pace-setting, its design and even drinks. (Runners can be disqualified for sipping anything but drinks picked up at a designated aid station.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was singularly designed for [Kipchoge], so it was built around him. They basically throw the rules out,\u201d said Carey Pinkowski, who has served as race director for the Chicago Marathon for 30 years. The Chicago Marathon is known worldwide as one of the fastest courses because of its flatness, wind-neutralizing design and the relative mild weather. Pinkowski said similar factors were at work in the course set out in Vienna: flat, near sea level and shielded from wind and harsh sun thanks to a canopy of trees.\n\nAD\n\nTo break the wind, a group of elite pacesetters ran around Kipchoge in a reverse-V formation. Forty \u201crabbits,\u201d as pace setters are known, rotated in and out so that each rabbit who rotated in was on fresh enough legs to keep Kipchoge\u2019s sub-4:34 minute pace.\n\nAs Magness, the performance coach, noted, these weren\u2019t just any runners, either.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you played a pickup football game and everyone is an NFL star. You had Olympic medalist athletes pacing him,\u201d Magess said. \u201cIf you took the best NCAA runner, they could maybe make it 20 to 25 percent of the way. To even be able to pace this, you have to be the best in the world.\"\n\nAD\n\nKeeping up is only half the battle, Magness added. Pacing requires precision, with even elite pacers fluctuating by five seconds faster or slower than the target pace. Magness said while that may not sound like a big deal, at the elite level, a five-second variance over 26.2 miles can be the difference between a world record and finding yourself completely out of gas \u2014 what\u2019s known in marathon running as \u201chitting a wall\u201d or \u201cbonking.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe pacers themselves were guided by a pace car that projected a green laser that strategically indicated where on the road they should run for the shortest possible distance. Magness said a course is measured in the shortest distance a runner could, and that a runner moving from side to side or the outer edge of turns will inevitably add distance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNormally I don\u2019t like to fall for marketing stuff, but if you look at the research and data, the shoes seem to have a big effect,\u201d Magness said.\n\nAD\n\nMike Joyner, a Mayo Clinic faculty member who for years has studied human performance in relation to breaking a two-hour marathon barrier, agreed that the shoe criticism shouldn\u2019t detract from Kipchoge\u2019s achievement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot criticism over the shoes, but the shoes are hiding in plain sight. Back in the late \u201870s, people at Harvard designed an optimized track and runners ran 2 to 3 percent faster. The same principles are in this shoes, which maximize recoil properties in the human leg.\u201d Joyner said.\n\nSome reactions to Kipchoge\u2019s feat \u2014 or rather, the conditions that facilitated it \u2014 have been less rosy. On Sunday, The Atlantic characterized sub-two-hour marathon time as the \u201cGreatest, Fakest World Record.\u201d The piece quoted British sports scientist Yannis Pitsiladis, known in the racing community for his effort to design a training program that would help an athlete break the two-hour marathon barrier, as dismissing the INEOS 1:59 Challenge as a marketing gimmick. \u201cI can\u2019t get excited about this,\u201d Pitsiladis told the Times of London. \u201cIt\u2019s meaningless.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJoyner called such criticisms as \u201csour grapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll large sporting events are manufactured. People can be purist about it, but I think it\u2019s kind of whiny,\u201d Joyner said. \u201cYes, [Kipchoge] had the course and the support, and the weather and the gear. Nevertheless, you go out and run 26 miles at four minutes and see how it feels.\u201d\n\nAs much as Kipchoge had the benefit of ideal conditions, Joyner said the number-one-ranked marathon runner is considered a once-in-a-generation talent. And despite gradually falling marathon times, crossing the two-hour barrier wasn\u2019t always a given.\n\nMen\u2019s marathon times dropped by minutes each decade until about the 1960s, according to Joyner.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat happened is people went from running 30 to 40 minutes to more like 100 miles per week, and training year round,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nYesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women\u2019s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they\u2019re also remarkable examples of humanity\u2019s ability to endure\u2014and keep raising the bar. \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 13, 2019\n\nThe talent pool and competition improved, and races were more professional, but times weren\u2019t sinking as sharply, cementing the mythical status of the two-hour marathon time. From Australian Derek Clayton\u2019s sub-2:09 marathon time in Antwerp in 1969 to Kenyan Abel Kirui\u2019s 2:05:04 in Rotterdam in 2009, \u201cit took 30 years to take off three minutes,\u201d Joyner said.\n\n(Joyner notes that for women marathoners, who were barred from most major races until the mid-1970s, the experience was compressed, and times grew more competitive at a faster rate. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take them 50 years like the men did to figure out how to train.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nNow that the barrier to something long thought impossible has fallen, Joyner said the human race may have to wait another lifetime before the next big milestone.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a long time till people ever run a 1:50:00 marathon,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Long seen as unbreakable, Kipchoge\u2019s sub-two-hour marathon touched off a wave of excitement -- and debate.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/buCRqnE-xLdQU_7-WYD3-VjL5Zc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OTZ4TJXM7EI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
