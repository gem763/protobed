Each city saw prices rise 4.5% in the same time. Bristol is also home to the fastest-moving rental market, as homes in the city find a tenant in an average of nine days, the report said.\n\n\n\nIn London\u2014where growth had been negative between September 2016 and the start of 2018\u2014rental growth increased 2.3% in the third quarter.\n\n\n\nAberdeen, Scotland, was the worst-performing rental market, with values falling 4.1% annually. The coastal city, famed for its oil industry, has seen a decline in rental demand and rents since oil prices collapsed in 2015, the report said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117183?size=1.5724815724815724&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
