The Murphyssance? Eddie-geddon? Ed-Ed Redemption 2? That one\u2019s stupid, but at least it acknowledges that an Ed-Ed Redemption 1 was attempted with Tower Heist. Regardless of what you call it, another work in the Murphyssance canon has been confirmed. Speaking on the Present Company with Krista Smith podcast, Murphy said \u201cNext year I am going to tour, do some stand-up.\u201d Murphy gave no further details, but a standup tour is one of many projects he has in the offing. Dolemite Is My Name is coming to Netflix soon, and rumor has it that Murphy is in talks with the streaming service to do a standup special. And Murphy is returning to Saturday Night Live December 21.", "description": "Eddie Murphy confirmed on a Netflix podcast that he will be returning to stand-up comedy next year.
