We have a different way of doing things and you know I\u2019m not going to change who I am. I am who I am, and I\u2019ve always been that way.\u201d\n\nIf Sanders were to win the presidency, and Democrats take back the House and Senate, Manchin and other moderates would likely play a crucial role in determining whether or not his legislative agenda could succeed.\n\nIn his interview with CNBC, Sanders argued that Manchin would support his policy plans because he would take his message to West Virginia. Sanders won the Democratic primary in West Virginia in 2016.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour average politician sits around and he or she thinks, \u2018Let\u2019s see. If I do this, I\u2019m going to have the big money interests putting 30-second ads against me,\u201d Sanders told CNBC. \u201cBut now they\u2019re going to have to think, \u2018If I don\u2019t support an agenda that works for working people, I\u2019m going to have President Sanders coming to my state and rallying working-class people.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his interview with CNBC, Sen.

He reiterated he does not support \u201cMedicare for All\u201d - Sanders\u2019 signature campaign issue which would eliminate private health insurance and place everyone under a single government-run health insurance plan.\n\nThe West Virginia senator would rather focus on addressing issues with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Manchin said, of Medicare for All. \u201cBasically we can\u2019t pay for \u2018Medicare for some\u2019\u2026 I think we ought to be fixing the Affordable Care Act. And we got two bills that would do it and reduce the private pay immensely. So yeah, we just have a difference on that.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d2/9b/c4a458b14b87bc985d9b957c03b7/20190913-joe-manchin-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
