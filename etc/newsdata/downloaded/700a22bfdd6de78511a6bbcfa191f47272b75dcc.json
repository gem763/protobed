The quarterly online survey interviews around 500 individuals representing a cross section of Singaporean households.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nDBS Group Research is a co-sponsor and research partner together with the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics (SKBI) at SMU.\n\nThe September poll showed that inflation expectations across all categories have either stayed the same or inched up quarter on quarter. The component indices that saw an increase in predicted inflation rates were transport, healthcare, education, recreation and communications.\n\nThe survey findings were released on Monday, a week after the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced it would reduce slightly the pace of appreciation for the Singapore dollar in its first easing in three years.\n\nMAS had said that a modest pick-up in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2020 will likely keep inflationary pressures muted. The central bank narrowed its projection for 2019\u2019s headline inflation to 0.5 per cent, and expects headline inflation to average 0.5 to 1.5 per cent in 2020. MAS also predicts core inflation will come in at the lower end of the 1-2 per cent forecast range for 2019, and average 0.5-1.5 per cent in 2020.\n\nThe marginal uptick in Singaporeans\u2019 inflation expectations in September is thus \u201ca tad surprising\u201d, against the backdrop of monetary easing, economic and political uncertainty, and dimmed growth expectations, SMU's Prof Ghosh said on Monday.\n\nThere is a natural tendency for survey-based inflation expectations measures to often be biased upwards despite adjustments, he added. This has been widely observed in survey-based methods in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in the US, and more recently in New Zealand and Italy.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore premature to read anything major from the latest findings,\u201d Prof Ghosh noted.\n\nMeanwhile, DBS chief economist and managing director of group research Taimur Baig said on Monday that inflation remains low worldwide, with Singapore at the centre of that narrative.\n\n\u201cWhile such a trend is likely to persist, signs of a short-term bottom in inflation, both actual and expected, have emerged. Food and energy prices are low, but not falling any further,\u201d Mr Baig added.\n\nThe results of the DBS-SMU survey are consistent with the around 3 per cent medium-term inflation expectations in Singapore, according to Mr Baig.\n\nFor the longer horizon, over the next five years, Singaporeans believe overall or headline inflation will rise to 4.1 per cent, up from 3.9 per cent in June.\n\nExpectations of core inflation in the five years ahead stayed largely stable at 3.9 per cent, compared to 3.8 per cent in the June poll.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - SINGAPOREANS believe overall or headline inflation will rise slightly to 3.2 per cent over the next 12 months. .
