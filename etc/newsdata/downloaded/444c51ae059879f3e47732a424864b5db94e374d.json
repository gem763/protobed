Fans on social media believed he said 'sacked in the morning', clearly making reference to Solskjaer's future, and those suggestions have now been supported by the lip-readers.\n\nWithout hesitation, Woodward quickly turned around and issued a sharp response to Jones.\n\nUnited, however, insist Woodward was actually questioning whether Hammers defender Issa Diop had been shown a yellow card, claiming he'd said: 'Has he been booked, Diop?'\n\nOnlookers took to Twitter to express their fury at the embarrassing situation on Sunday with one saying: 'Rivalries aside they are one of the biggest clubs in world football & Phil Jones is caught doing this - that dressing room & team is finished if this sort of things that fringe players who've done nothing are coming out with'.\n\nHowever, a wider angle of the incident appears to show Woodward possibly talking to another member of United's staff.\n\nAnother angle appears to show Woodward was talking to another member of United's staff\n\nSpeaking after the game, Solskjaer refused to criticise his players after their performance was slammed by Roy Keane and former boss Jose Mourinho during Sky Sports' coverage of the clash.\n\nThe Norwegian said: 'The players are doing what I'm asking them to. There are key moments in games that can tip these games in our favour compared to theirs and you make maybe a bad decision on a pass - left, right, centre - but the attitude and desire is there.\n\n'That's not the problem. It's the quality in our decision-making, sometimes in the execution. It's a good group to work with. They are determined. Sometimes along the road, we are going to hit some bumps, as we've said, some highs and lows.\n\n'This group is out there determined, they showed the desire, it was a good atmosphere in the dressing room. They've got the focus right.'", "description": "Professional lip readers have confirmed Phil Jones said 'sacked in the morning' before executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was forced into telling the Manchester United star to be quiet.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/09/18814644-0-image-a-23_1569227259325.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
