Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had surged past Biden into first place in the race for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nA Monmouth Poll of early primary states released Wednesday found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (25%) by 3% \u2014 barely within the poll\u2019s 3.1% margin of error. A new YouGov/Economist poll found Warren (28%) ahead of Biden (22%) by 6%.\n\nMoreover, the breaking news that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, had been admitted to hospital for emergency heart surgery also drew attention to Biden\u2019s age (76) and his own history of health problems.\n\nStill, Biden wanted Trump \u2014 and Democrats \u2014 to know that he would fight on, in response to Trump\u2019s charges that he and his son, Hunter, were \u201cstone-cold crooked.\u201d The Washington Post reported from his remarks, as prepared for delivery:\n\n\u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2014 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden will say. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d \u2026 Biden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, \u201clike every bully in history\u2014he\u2019s afraid. He\u2019s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.\u201d\n\nThe Post concluded its story by quoting Biden: \u201cNobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what\u2019s that fellow\u2019s name? Rudy Udi? Giuliani?\u201d\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
