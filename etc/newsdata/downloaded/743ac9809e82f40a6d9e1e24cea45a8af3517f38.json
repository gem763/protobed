At the time Brian Houston was the national president.\n\nSexual abuse victim of Hillsong founder\u2019s father blasts PM for supporting Brian Houston Read more\n\nSengstock is one of seven of Frank Houston\u2019s reported victims, with the majority in New Zealand. He gave evidence to the royal commission in 2014 under the pseudonym AHA, but has since given media interviews without anonymity.\n\nThe royal commission found Frank Houston was allowed to resign his position in the church and was given a retirement package up until his death in 2004.\n\nBrian Houston has defended not reporting his father\u2019s confession to police, stating he had a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d because he said Sengstock had said he did not want to go to the authorities. He also said that because Sengstock was an adult when the abuse was first reported, it was his prerogative to report it. Sengstock has denied telling Houston not to go to the police.\n\nNSW police received a referral to investigate the failure to report Frank Houston\u2019s confession after the royal commission\u2019s findings were released in 2015, but no charges have yet eventuated from the investigation.\n\nIn a 2GB interview last week, Houston insisted the investigation was only open because charges had not yet been laid, and it would continue to remain open.\n\nBut NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller told a state parliament estimates committee in November last year investigators were \u201cfollowing a number of lines of inquiry\u201d into the actions taken when dealing with the allegations against Frank Houston.\n\nIn a written response to questions on notice, Fuller said the investigation had stalled in late 2016 not long after Brian Houston declined to be interviewed in July that year.\n\n\u201cIn July 2016 Mr Brian Houston declined to be interviewed or assist police with the investigation. In November 2016 legal advice was received regarding a lack of sufficient evidence to proceed,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nBut NSW police launched a review of its original investigation in October 2018 and were trying to resolve legal issues around sufficiency and admissibility of evidence.\n\n\u201cHowever, the [NSW police force] is currently taking steps to resolve these issues, including obtaining fresh legal advice and following a number of lines of inquiry into this investigation.\n\n\u201cPolice are maintaining contact with the victim.\u201d\n\nBrian Houston says he 'genuinely doesn\u2019t know' if PM wanted him at White House dinner Read more\n\nNSW police declined to comment beyond the existing statement being provided to media that the investigation remains ongoing, but it is understood the situation regarding any interview has not changed since Fuller\u2019s statement in November 2018.\n\nThe Guardian has sought comment from Houston via Hillsong.\n\nMorrison appeared on stage with Brian Houston at Hillsong in July this year, and has refused to answer any questions on whether he sought to bring the Hillsong leader to the United States for his visit.\n\nOfficials at Senate estimates last week took questions on notice on the matter, stating releasing the information could potentially damage international relations with the US.", "description": "Parliamentary documents show NSW police were advised they lacked evidence to proceed with inquiry after Houston\u2019s refusal", "authors": ["Josh Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a79825af5329fdf976a02906b88b5df6ddaf4b82/207_2_1924_1155/master/1924.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5da702f852c30e29d3181de84c6d82ae", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
