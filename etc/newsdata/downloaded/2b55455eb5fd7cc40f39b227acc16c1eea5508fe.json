Biden Jr. and his son. Investigators also want answers on whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine\u2019s state-owned gas company.\n\nHours earlier, they demanded that two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, appear for depositions next Wednesday and hand over records related to their work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Mr. Giuliani has been the point man in the president\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine, around which the inquiry is centered. The subpoenas came shortly after the two men were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that touched on their work in Ukraine.\n\nThe new subpoenas, and more in the works, sent a clear message to the White House that Democrats do not intend to back down from a growing constitutional clash over their inquiry, even after the White House defiantly said this week that it would stonewall all requests for witnesses and documents.", "description": "Hours after two associates of the president\u2019s personal lawyer were indicted on federal campaign finance charges, the House also subpoenaed them for depositions about their work in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/us/politics/10dc-impeach/10dc-impeach-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
