Good enough that he got a sponsor\u2019s exemption to play in this week\u2019s Safeway Open on the PGA Tour.\n\nAnd that would be fine if this was June or July, but Romo is scheduled to join Jim Nantz on the call of the Minnesota Vikings-Chicago Bears game on Sunday afternoon.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCBS had to come up with a contingency plan if Romo plays well enough to make the cut and last to the weekend in his golf event, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nTony Romo will be at PGA Tour event\n\nRomo is a very good golfer, but not great. CBS probably doesn\u2019t need to worry about Romo, the former Cowboys quarterback, making the cut.\n\nThe most likely scenario is Romo plays, generates some publicity for the tournament (which he\u2019s already done, considering it\u2019s already generating stories about his availability for Vikings-Bears), misses the cut and then leaves Napa, Calif. for Chicago after a couple days of golf. He\u2019ll take a private jet if he misses the cut and be on hand for Saturday preparations, the Tribune said.\n\nThat\u2019s if he misses the cut. If he makes it, the Tribune said fellow former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason will fill in with Nantz.\n\nRomo is a star in the booth\n\nRomo\u2019s entire career at CBS has been unique.\n\nHe came straight from NFL retirement to the broadcast booth. He was raw and excitable, and that became part of his charm. He was an instant star in the CBS booth at a time in which everything and anything is ripped apart on social media.\n\nRomo presumably doesn\u2019t want to miss work on Sunday. But if he does, it\u2019s because he\u2019s had a fantastic week on the golf course.\n\nTony Romo is participating in a PGA Tour event this week.
