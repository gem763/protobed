Johnson has announced a woefully inadequate funding package for support services for survivors of sexual violence, as well as establishing the role of Domestic Abuse Commissioner which, unfortunately, has no formal powers until the Domestic Abuse Bill passes through parliament and becomes law.\n\n\u201dBut by perpetuating sexist attitudes like those displayed in this book, he himself has directly contributed to a culture in which women are continually belittled, denigrated and, as a result, all too frequently denied the justice and support they require.\u201c\n\nThe Independent has contacted a representative for Downing Street for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Triangle News", "description": "Boris Johnson has been branded \u201cchauvinist\u00a0and racist\u201d by politicians after remarks he made in an old book about cars resurfaced.\u00a0 The prime minister uses Life in the Fast Lane: The Johnson Guide to Cars to make a slew of crude sexual innuendos and suggest women are incapable of map-reading.
