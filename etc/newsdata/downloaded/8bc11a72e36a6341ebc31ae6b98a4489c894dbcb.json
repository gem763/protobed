Engel\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nThe Trump administration also threatened sanctions against Turkey on Friday, but did not announce any immediate plans to do so.\n\nThe possibility of sanctions comes after a fierce backlash from Trump\u2019s own party, with top Republicans, like House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), criticizing Trump for acceding to Turkey.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators, led by Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), released a bill Wednesday proposing a series of sanctions against Turkey. It\u2019s not clear whether Engel\u2019s bill would be similar.\n\nThe hourlong Democratic caucus call comes just days before the House is slated to return from its two-week recess, where Trump\u2019s rapidly intensifying controversy with Ukraine will be the central focus.\n\nIt was also the first call since Trump delivered his strongly worded letter to Democrats, warning that he would not cooperate in their investigation into his attempts to persuade Ukrainian leaders to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who has spent two weeks holding closed-door depositions with key witnesses, told Democrats there is evidence foofr more than one \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d But he said the fact that Trump allegedly sought foreign assistance for political benefit is enough.\n\n\u201cIf they get in our way, they are building a case for obstruction of Congress,\u201d Schiff told his colleagues.\n\nOne lawmaker, Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.), asked whether there\u2019s anything House Democrats can do if the White House continues to defy subpoenas. The response from top Democrats: not much, which is why the inquiry is important.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) added that they are in a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nAdditionally on the call, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump a \u201ca potty-mouth and children are listening,\u201d referring to his profanity-laced rally in Minnesota on Thursday night.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/26/55/d8255c43492692002156c0c2b665/190617-engel2-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
