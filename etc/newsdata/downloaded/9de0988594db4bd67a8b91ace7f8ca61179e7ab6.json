Col. Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs on the National Security Council (NSC), on Tuesday testified for roughly 10 hours before House investigators. Vindman said Sondland had direct involvement in pressuring Zelensky for investigations into both the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry Army officer twice reported concerns about Trump's Ukraine tactics Ex-Trump official's refusal to testify escalates impeachment tensions MORE, one of Trump\u2019s top 2020 political opponents.\n\nSome Democrats said Vindman\u2019s testimony uncovered a crime: Sondland, they charged, had lied under oath.\n\n\"He clearly lied to the committee. They should pursue charges against him,\u201d said one Democratic lawmaker involved with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOther Democrats, while they didn\u2019t call for a specific course of action, said they also believed Sondland was not truthful and should return to Capitol Hill to face questions about these conflicting accounts.\n\n\u201cBased on all the testimony so far, I believe that Ambassador Gordon Sondland committed perjury,\u201d tweeted Rep.

Sondland's legal team declined to comment on points raised in Vindman's opening statement.\n\nSince then, Democrats have raised more alarms about Sondland\u2019s testimony, particularly after William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, testified last week that he believed the Trump administration had withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in an effort to get Zelensky to open the Biden and 2016 probes. Sondland, echoing Trump, had asserted there was no such quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cI walk away with the impression Mr. Sondland will have some explaining to do,\u201d Rep.

Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\u201d Vindman\u2019s opening statement reads. \u201cDr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate.\u201d\n\nA chief complaint from Democrats following Sondland\u2019s Oct. 17 deposition was what they characterized as a lack of specificity \u2014 one lawmaker called it \u201cselective amnesia\u201d \u2014 as he relayed events related to the administration\u2019s pressure campaign on the Ukrainians.\n\nIndeed, Rep.

The president's allies would like nothing better than to help the president out this whistleblower. Our committee will not be a part of that,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThey have the right to remain anonymous.\u201d\n\nRebecca Klar contributed.", "description": "House Democrats\u00a0are weighing whether to take action against U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who some lawmakers believe misled impeachment investigators during his closed-door deposition earlier this month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sondlandgordon_051419getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
