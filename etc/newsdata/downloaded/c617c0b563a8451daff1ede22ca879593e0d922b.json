For the next 15 tracks, the Houston teens sang harmonious anthems letting haters know they were \u201cSo Good,\u201d calling out a pressed \u201cBug a Boo\u201d and asking why men do women wrong on \u201cHey Ladies.\u201d And unlike their ballad-heavy debut album, the group rode the up-tempo beats with their distinct sing-rapping.\n\n1999 was a remarkable year for the genre. That year, Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d with Kelly Price and Faith Evans peaked on the Billboard Hot 100, Mariah Carey released \u201cHeartbreaker,\u201d Brandy had us asking \u201cHave You Ever?\u201d and Blaque had a hit with \u201cBring It All to Me.\u201d Crooners owned mainstream R&B, Monica, Maxwell and Ginuwine included. But artists like TLC, Missy Elliott and Timbaland were playing with a more hip-hop-leaning R&B by this time, making room for Destiny\u2019s Child to flex.\n\n\u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d was not only the last album to feature all four original members, but it became the foundation of the group\u2019s signature sound. It was a part of a new wave of R&B that would last for several years to come. The songs were original, with samples from only \u201cBug a Boo\u201d and \u201cTemptation,\u201d and only included two features from Missy Elliott and Next. And the message was an affirmative, biblical even, body of female empowerment anthems as Destiny\u2019s Child laid out the relationship commandments. Thou shall pay bills, thou shall not bug, thou shall confess, and so on.\n\nThe legendary status just jumped out.\n\n\u201cIt was a sound that cut through everything else that was going on,\u201d music industry veteran and writer Naima Cochrane told HuffPost during a phone conversation. \u201cBut still, it had elements of Missy in it, that futuristic kind of production, but it didn\u2019t really sound exactly like anything else that was on the radio.\u201d\n\nThe album, released July 27, 1999, earned the group its first two No. 1 records with the lead single \u201cBills, Bills, Bills\u201d followed by \u201cSay My Name.\u201d The album debuted at No. 6 and remained on the Billboard Top 40 for most of that year. \u201cSay My Name\u201d earned Destiny\u2019s Child its first Grammy. Produced by Missy, Kandi Burruss, Kevin \u201cShe\u2019kspere\u201d Briggs, Rodney \u201cDarkchild\u201d Jerkins, D\u2019wayne Wiggins, Chad Elliot, Daryl Simmons and Beyonc\u00e9 herself, \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d is still Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s best-selling album, moving more than 6 million units in the U.S. to date.\n\n\u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d encouraged women to know their value, walked no good men like dogs, sought reciprocity in relationships and reminded the boys that women know how to creep, too. The album told a story of empowerment. With this album, Destiny\u2019s Child helped open the doors for Jazmine Sullivan to \u201cbust the windows out your car\u201d and Lizzo to remind y\u2019all that her DNA test proves she\u2019s \u201c100 percent that bitch.\u201d\n\nMuch of that messaging is thanks to singer and producer Kandi. Coming off of writing \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d for TLC, the former Xscape member had a deal with Mathew Knowles, Bey\u2019s dad and the group\u2019s manager at the time, to work on only one song for the group, \u201cBug a Boo,\u201d as the album was almost complete.\n\n\u201cThat was around the time when a lot of people weren\u2019t doing that type of writing style where it sounded like \u2018sing-rapping,\u2019\u201d Kandi told Noisey in July. \u201cIf you think about all the music that came before that, it was more melodic. The lyrics weren\u2019t as rappy, so the beats that we played for them were more hard and fast.\u201d\n\nThey liked the sound so much that they restructured the album to include more tracks with a similar style. Kandi and She\u2019kspere went on to write four songs on the album, \u201cBills, Bills, Bills,\u201d \u201cHey Ladies\u201d and \u201cShe Can\u2019t Love You.\u201d She\u2019kspeare also worked on \u201cSo Good.\u201d\n\nWith the new sound and the empowering subject matter demanding equity in relationships, Kandi and She\u2019kespere helped the group dance on unchartered territory. For a quartet still trying to earn its foothold in music while taking more creative agency over their music, that was a risk. The four teens had been singing together since 1990 when they were known as Girl\u2019s Tyme. After a failed attempt to win Star Search, the group played the game of work hard and wait to catch their big break until they finally signed to Columbia Records in 1997. Their self-titled debut album, which was released in 1998, was driven by the group\u2019s melodies and went on to platinum status.\n\nThe upbeat sound on \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d was a sonic departure from their debut album, sans \u201cNo, No, No Part 2,\u201d heavily influenced by Wyclef Jean. In a 1999 interview, Beyonc\u00e9 revealed how Destiny\u2019s Child developed its signature sound.\n\n\u201cWe were gonna totally change \u2018No, No, No\u2019 for the remix,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cAnd [Wyclef] said, \u2018No, girls, it\u2019d be really phat if you girls sing it the exact same way but fast.\u2019 And we were like, \u2018No, Clef, it\u2019s no way.\u2019 He was like, \u2018Yes.\u2019 So \u2026 I was playing around and he was like, \u2018That\u2019s phat!\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, Clef.\u2019 So he recorded it. I did it one time and he kept it and was like no, I\u2019m not changing it. And that was the song right there. It worked for us so we ended up doing it other times on other songs.\u201d\n\nThe mainstream critical acclaim was just not there initially. This was a group of teen girls talking their shit about bills, broke men and infidelity. Judging by the reviews, the music world wasn\u2019t ready for that.\n\nThe Rolling Stone\u2019s Rob Sheffield compared Destiny\u2019s Child to TLC in a 1999 album review of \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d: \u201cDespite OK moments like the \u2018Waterfalls\u2019 sequel \u2018Sweet Sixteen,\u2019 the Destiny children never find that one money tune that turns a no-no-no scrub into a yeah-yeah-yeah paying customer.\u201d They were also getting accused of man-bashing on their album. New York group Sporty Thievz even wrote a diss track titled \u201cNo Bills, Bills, Bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe odds were definitely stacked against them when you consider that their biggest \u2018rival,\u2019 if you will, also put an album out in \u201999,\u201d Mike Hamilton, director of commerce at Epic Records, told HuffPost, referring to TLC\u2019s \u201cFanMail.\u201d \u201cI think that the sophomore album is always the make or break for any artist. That\u2019s the album that there\u2019s always more riding on it. I\u2019m pretty sure they went into it thinking like, \u2018There\u2019s a lot riding on this,\u2019 and they succeeded. That was the album that could have broken them and they completely took it to the next level.\u201d\n\nJim Smeal via Getty Images From left: LeToya Luckett, LaTavia Robertson, Kelly Rowland and Beyonce Knowles at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for the 13th Annual Soul Train Music Awards in 1999.\n\nWhat critics may have not known, however, is that Destiny\u2019s Child was helping usher in the sound of the new millennium. The heavy, futuristic production flirted with the pop charts nicely, but the scandal of Letoya and LaTavia getting fired and subsequent lawsuit mid-album cycle was the cherry on top. Folks became curious, especially after the \u201cSay My Name\u201d video dropped and two were absent. That curiosity led to even more commercial success for the album. The album\u2019s highest-selling week came in 2000 over Christmas, more than a year after its release.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about that transitional phase between the \u201990s and the early aughts, I think that \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d is near the top of that list [of albums],\u201d Cochrane said. \u201cIt set the tone for what mainstream R&B was gonna sound like for the next several years and the R&B sound that was neo-soul started moving into the adult urban lane. \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d is like that fork in the road between what started as mainstream R&B and what ended up becoming adult contemporary R&B.\u201d\n\nThe high rotational value of this album cannot be overstated. When you think of music in 1999, \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d and its many anthems are at the forefront. And several girl groups at that time were embracing R&B\u2019s new, empowering wave. TLC, Blaque, En Vogue and 702 all dropped classic albums that year that cemented R&B\u2019s new direction. TLC\u2019s \u201cFanMail\u201d is the only album from an R&B girl group in 1999 that has outsold \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d to this day.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Destiny\u2019s Child that was special was because they were a four-girl group and they had the harmony, the harmonies rode the rhythm and they still had a chance to shine through over everything that was happening in production and Bey specifically, obviously, even then, she was the dominant lead on every single track. So I do think that in that way, \u2018Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u2019 is perfect, the quintessential 1999 album,\u201d Cochrane said.\n\nShe referred to the album as \u201cbaby \u2018Lemonade,\u2019\u201d because the album also set up Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s solo career in a major way. From the sing-rapping to the hands-on production to the content matter, Beyonc\u00e9 regularly reaches back to what worked on \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d as a solo artist. (See: \u201cKitty Kat,\u201d \u201cUpgrade U,\u201d \u201cCountdown,\u201d \u201cSorry\u201d and \u201cHold Up.\u201d) Bey knows the work they put in to create \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d is the perfect formula. And it still works.\n\nLong gone are the days of R&B girl groups dominating the Billboard charts, however. Cochrane called Destiny\u2019s Child \u201cthe first of the last girl groups.\u201d And, unsurprisingly, we miss it. Yes, this album was ahead of its time when it came to production and the overall messaging, but a huge reason we still play it is the same reason we want Destiny\u2019s Child to do a reunion tour, following suit with Xscape, New Edition and B2K: nostalgia. \u201cThe Writing\u2019s on the Wall\u201d and its impact is a once in a lifetime experience. We didn\u2019t realize it then, but 20 years later, it resonates like no other.\n\nThou shall never forget that.\n\n\u201cFor The Love of 1999\u201d is a weeklong series offering some totally bangin\u2019 essays and analysis of some hot \u2014 or not \u2014 TV, music, movies and celebrities of 1999.
