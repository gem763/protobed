Specifically, income-based segregation has contributed to nearly a third (28%) of the overall increase in income inequality.\n\nOne of the main factors driving both of these issues is education. Certain learned skills, such as those related to computer programming, fetch a premium in today\u2019s economy, increasing the gap in wages between highly educated and less educated workers.\n\n\u201cRicher parents with more talented children choose to pay higher rents to live in the neighborhood with higher average human capital,\u201d the paper found. In other words, wealthier families will choose to live in an area with better schools and more-educated neighbors to ensure their kids will succeed.\n\nRead more: Millennials shouldn\u2019t need the \u2018Bank of Mom & Dad\u2019 in order to buy a house\n\nIndeed, more than half of home buyers with children under the age of 18 said that school districts were an important factor when choosing a home, compared with 10% of buyers who didn\u2019t have children, according to a separate study from the National Association of Realtors.\n\nWealthy parents are segregating toward higher-income neighborhoods in search of better school districts, pushing up house prices in those zip codes.\n\nThey are prepared to make serious trade-offs \u2014 in terms of the size of home or the amenities it has \u2014 to move their family closer to a better school.\n\nAs a result, wealthy parents are essentially self-segregating toward higher-income neighborhoods in search of better school districts, pushing up house prices in those zip codes, and leaving lower-income families behind.\n\nThis, in turn, can cause a vicious cycle, experts say, because public school funding often relies on local taxes \u2014 and wealthier families will pay more in taxes, in turn leading to their schools being better funded. As economic segregation increases between the rich and everyone else, economists say, it will affect a larger share of the population.\n\nPrevious research has shown that low-income African American families, for instance, move home out of necessity. One study found that among low-income black families in Mobile, Ala., and Baltimore, 70% of recent moves were caused by issues related to landlords, the home\u2019s quality or violence.", "description": "Education is one of the main driving factors behind both income inequality and segregation.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP266_school_ZG_20190812172347.jpg"}
