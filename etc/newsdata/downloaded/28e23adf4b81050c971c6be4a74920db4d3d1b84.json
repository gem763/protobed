Veuer\u2019s Natasha Abellard has the story. Buzz60\n\nA mass inspection of older Boeing 737 NGs worldwide has found 36 with cracked wing supports, resulting in their grounding pending repairs, the aerospace giant said Wednesday.\n\nThat represented about 5% of the 686 planes inspected for cracks following an order issued last week by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nSome airlines were hit harder than others. Southwest Airlines had two planes that will have to be taken out of service pending repairs and Brazilian carrier GOL had 11, according to multiple news reports.\n\nPassengers boarding a Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-800 aircraft at the airport in Padang, West Sumatra.

Southwest alone has about 700 NGs in its fleet. American has 304 and Delta has 200.\n\nThe inspection order only covered some of the most heavily flown 737 NGs. The cracks were found in a component called the pickle fork, which help attach the wings to the fuselage. The FAA said the cracks could \"adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane and result in loss of control of the airplane\" if not addressed.\n\nCheck your flight: American removes 737 Max from schedule through holiday travel rush\n\nThe 737 NG crack issue came as Boeing continues to try to revamp and test the flight control system in the 737 Max, grounded after the crashes of Lion Air jet a year ago and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March.\n\nBoeing is counting on software changes in a system designed to work in the background make the plane feel like previous versions. But the crashes occurred after pilots on both jets wrestled with the automated system, which kept pushing the plane's nose down as they tried to keep it aloft.\n\nA total of 346 died in the two crashes.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/09/boeing-737-ng-faa-inspection-wing-support-cracks-36-planes/3926470002/", "description": "The FAA ordered inspections after cracks were found in the supports of older Boeing 737 NG models being converted to cargo planes", "authors": ["Chris Woodyard", "Published P.M.
