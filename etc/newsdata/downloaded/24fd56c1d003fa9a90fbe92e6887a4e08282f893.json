After arguing on the road, both men had pulled over and continued their confrontation.\n\nWhile arguing his case, Masooa claimed he had acted in self-defence after he was assaulted by Pearce. He claimed Pearce had been following him, swearing and shouting racial slurs at him before they both pulled over.\n\nMasooa said he saw Pearce pull out a firearm resulting in him pulling out his too - out of fear. He argued the biker had shot first, and he only started firing when he realised his life was in danger, adding he had no intention to kill Pearce.\n\nSpilg dismissed evidence given to the court by the Johannesburg Metro Police Department, which had testified for the State.\n\nHe said because, according to Masooa, the scene was fluid, it was common cause, according to evidence given by the defence, he [Masooa] was panicking during the incident.\n\nSpilg added whatever one's doubts might be regarding the incident, the test remained whether the State had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. He did not believe that that was the case.\n\nHe said it was clear that the evidence the court should accept was that Masooa did not exceed the bounds of self-defence, and there was nothing the State submitted refuting that Pearce was the aggressor and he had already taken out a firearm at some stage, as alleged by Masooa.\n\nSpilg said more evidence about what had happened to the firearm the deceased allegedly had was evidence that would only be needed to be corroborated by the deceased, which was impossible.\n\n\"Having found that, the accused's version cannot be rejected. It cannot be said the accused did not fear that the deceased was going to shoot him.\n\n\"It is for this reason that the court's rule has come out. I am, however, satisfied the deceased was not shot in cold blood,\" he ruled.\n\nSpilg said the court found Masooa had reason and cause to fear for his life, adding there was sloppy field work done by those the State had relied on for its evidence.\n\nI knew from day one that I was not guilty\n\nPearce's family was shocked as Spilg concluded his judgment, with his mother, Mary Anne, bursting into tears. Masooa, meanwhile, walked out of court smiling.\n\nSpeaking to the media outside court, Masooa said he had always known he was not guilty and would win the case. He added he was merely acting out of self-defence, saying it was unfortunate the case had dragged on for so long.\n\n\"Justice was served that I am acquitted today, but it is painful because it messed up my life. I can only thank God, that after five years, I am vindicated,\" Masooa said.\n\nPearce's family declined to speak to the media.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
