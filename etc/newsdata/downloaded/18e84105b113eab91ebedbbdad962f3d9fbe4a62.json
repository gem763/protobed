'The wedding had been a really fantastic day and everyone had enjoyed it so much but I couldn't believe it when I started to feel unwell,' said Mr Kemp\n\nMr Mark Jackson, prosecuting on behalf of Lichfield District Council, said the environmental health department was contacted by Mrs Kemp two days after her wedding saying guests had been complaining of suffering from gastric illness symptoms including nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pains.\n\nOne man had been hospitalised.\n\nInvestigations traced the cause of salmonella from a hog roast which hadn't been cooked to a temperature beyond 75 degrees which would have killed off salmonella.\n\nWhen environmental health inspectors visited the premises days later they discovered food out of date, mould in the fridges, and raw meat chopping boards were being mixed with other foods.\n\nWhen environmental health inspectors visited the premises days later they discovered food out of date, mould in the fridges, and raw meat chopping boards were being mixed with other foods\n\nMr Christopher Russell, representing Galloping Gourmet (Coulsden) Ltd, said: 'The company has no previous convictions and has a five star rating at its other nine sites. Further improvements and safeguards have been made to ensure this never happens again.\n\n'The company would like to apologise for what happened to Mr and Mrs Kemp and their wedding guests.'\n\nKevin Grego, district judge, said: 'This had a devastating affect on Mr and Mrs Kemp on their wedding day. In total 53 guests were affected by salmonella poisoning. Records involving the hog roast were not proper, in fact fraudulent. The hog roast should have been heated to over 75 degrees but it wasn't and this caused salmonella to be present.'\n\nIn a statement released by solicitors Irwin Mitchell, Mr Kemp said: 'The wedding had been a really fantastic day and everyone had enjoyed it so much but I couldn't believe it when I started to feel unwell. It got to the point where I had to go to a local walk-in centre and after tests I was told I had salmonella - I just couldn't believe it.\n\nMr Kemp added: 'News of today's prosecution is very welcome and I hope that it is an outcome that caterers across the country pay attention to and learn from'\n\n'My illness lasted around 10 days all in all, but the symptoms were so bad that we had no option but to cancel our honeymoon to the Dominican Republic. I was totally devastated and we never got any money back from the tour operator or insurer in relation to it.\n\n'We did go away eventually, but this was obviously an extra cost on top of everything we had already paid. It was heartbreaking.'\n\nOther guests affected by the illness problems have gone on to suffer issues including irritable bowel syndrome and psychological conditions as a result of what they have been through.\n\nPhil added: 'News of today's prosecution is very welcome and I hope that it is an outcome that caterers across the country pay attention to and learn from. No one should have to go through what we have, especially in relation to their wedding day - it is just not acceptable.\n\n'Sadly a lot of the memories about what should have been the happiest day of mine and Vikki's lives are spoilt by what happened.\n\n'Nothing will change what has happened, but we now just hope these issues will never happen again.'", "description": "Couple Phil and Vikki Kemp were enjoying their wedding at Packington Hall, Warwickshire, when dozens of guests fell ill after eating an undercooked hog roast.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/15/19926208-0-image-a-29_1571494829716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
