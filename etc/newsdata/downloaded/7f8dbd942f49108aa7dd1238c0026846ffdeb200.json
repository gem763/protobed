Portland led 2-1 going into stoppage time, but New England was awarded a penalty kick after a video review and evened the score.\n\nThe foul was controversial because it came after the announced stoppage time had already expired, and the referees appeared to miss a similar foul that would have given Portland a penalty earlier.\n\nMLS did not reveal the nature of the misconduct in announcing the fine Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson has been fined $100,000 by Major League Soccer for \"misconduct directed at match officials.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
