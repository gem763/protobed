Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost.\n\nEnable, Stradivarius and now Beauty Generation all beaten in the space of two weeks \u2013 @charles_hunt12\n\nIt may sound ridiculous, but there are actually a lot of positives to come out of Beauty Generation\u2019s shock defeat on Sunday. Let\u2019s go through them.\n\nThe pressure is off\n\nThe thing with winning streaks is the longer they go on, the more scrutiny applied to everyone involved.\n\nJohn Moore made that clear earlier this year when asked about the pressure he feels on race day: \u201cIf I said that I was stress-free that would be B.S.\u201d\n\nThe Kwok family, who owns all the \u201cBeauty\u201d horses in Hong Kong, have kept moving the goalposts when it comes to targets for the two-time Horse of the Year.\n\nFirst it was about becoming Hong Kong\u2019s highest-ever prize money earner \u2013 he passed Viva Pataca\u2019s mark when taking out last season\u2019s Champions Mile.\n\nThen it was about chasing down Silent Witness\u2019 winning streak of 17, which affected decisions about which races Beauty Generation would target as they tried to protect a record that didn\u2019t really matter.\n\nNow it has stopped at 10, everyone can take a deep breath and it potentially opens up \u2026\n\nOverseas opportunities\n\nThere shouldn\u2019t be anything standing in the way of Beauty Generation testing himself on the world stage now.\n\nA trip to Meydan for the Group One Dubai Turf in March should now be a lock. There\u2019s no winning streak to protect, he is coming towards the back-end of his career so this is probably the last chance to do it near his peak.\n\nThis is Moore\u2019s final season at Sha Tin and he\u2019s desperate to show everyone what Beauty Generation is capable of away from the fishbowl.\n\nThere\u2019s no race for him in Hong Kong at the time, so it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to see how he measures up. That would be exciting.\n\nMore competition for HKIR?\n\nNow that the air of invincibility is gone \u2013 will more internationals consider making the trip to the Longines Hong Kong International Races?\n\nBefore Sunday, it was hard to see anyone making the effort to travel all that way (particularly in the current climate) when you would only be racing for second.\n\nThat might still be the case, but there has to be more of a chance that someone is prepared to back their horse in and give it a crack.\n\nShift in race tactics\n\nBeauty Generation\u2019s jockey Zac Purton has long lamented how some of his rivals go out of their way just to try to get the champ beaten and he said that was the case again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, the other connections specifically go out there just to try and beat one horse and they end up beating themselves, and that\u2019s what happened [on Sunday],\u201d Purton said. \u201cThey go out so fast that they just fall in a hole, they don\u2019t give themselves a chance.\u201d\n\nThe patrol footage is fascinating viewing. From barrier two, Purton tries to go forward but at the same time pushing wide so he is not trapped. It doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWhat a stunner! Rise High halts Beauty Generation's win streak at 10. #HKracing pic.twitter.com/lD81tp4pTR \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\nKaris Teetan (on Ka Ying Star) crosses, as does Derek Leung Ka-chun aboard Glorious Forever, who puts Beauty Generation in an awkward position and forces him into the box-seat. The champ doesn\u2019t like it at all, getting his head up as he tries to avoid heels.\n\nWhen you\u2019re carrying between 14 and 20 pounds more than everyone else, you need everything to go right and those moments matter.\n\nHis rivals know if he is allowed to dictate from the front, it is game over. Will they continue to do that or focus on themselves now he has been beaten?\n\nHe\u2019s still the best horse in Hong Kong\n\nDespite the loss, it is clear Beauty Generation is still the top dog in town.\n\nIn a race where everything went wrong and he was giving all of his rivals a lot of weight, he still finished third.\n\nNext time out in the Group Two Jockey Club Mile he will only carry five pounds more than anyone else and he won\u2019t be second-up after resuming with a gut-buster.\n\n\u201cThe worst run of last season was his second-up run. It\u2019s hard because they have such a long time off and he comes back, he runs such a good race first time out, then he\u2019s got to back up very quickly after that,\u201d Purton said.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s disappointing he\u2019s been beaten, but when you look at the weights of the race I don\u2019t think his performance is any worse than it was last season. Let\u2019s get back to set weights. He has a nice break between now and his next run and he\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s loss doesn\u2019t diminish Beauty Generation\u2019s achievements or his standing as one of the greatest horses Hong Kong has ever seen.\n\nIt is a reminder that these are animals, not machines, and even the best can be vulnerable under the right circumstances.", "description": "Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing.
