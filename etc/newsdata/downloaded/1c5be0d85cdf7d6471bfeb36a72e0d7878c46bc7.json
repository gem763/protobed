On Monday, at his first cabinet meeting since the House launched a formal impeachment inquiry, Trump \u201cinvited in the ladies and gentlemen of the press and calmly explained that there\u2019s nothing for him to be concerned about \u2026 for 71 minutes\u201d, Colbert explained.\n\n\u201cSeventy-one minutes is not a press conference; it\u2019s a one-man show,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIf you like Fleabag, you\u2019ll love Donald Trump in Douchebag.\u201d\n\nTrump was responding, in part, to the furor over his announcement last week that his National Doral golf resort in Florida would host next year\u2019s international G7 summit. \u201cTaxpayer money being spent at his own place \u2013 that is bald self-dealing,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d have to be an idiot to defend that.\u201d Enter the North Dakota senator Kevin Cramer, who said: \u201cIt may seem careless politically, but on the other hand there\u2019s tremendous integrity in his boldness and his transparency.\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah: seven scandals in one day 'might be the true genius of Trump' Read more\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s a certain refreshing candor,\u201d said Colbert, who imitated the president: \u201cHey, if I\u2019m going to get impeached anyway, I say it\u2019s bucket list time: G7 is at the Doral, we\u2019re serving nothing but Trump steaks, it\u2019s BYO porn star, and folks, don\u2019t forget your pistols because we\u2019re heading out to Fifth Avenue.\u201d\n\nStill, Cramer was in the minority. \u201cMost Republicans freaked out, ran for cover, changed their names, and filed off their fingerprints,\u201d said Colbert. So on Saturday, Trump announced that he would no longer host the summit at his resort, while also praising its beauty, grandeur and airport proximity.\n\n\u201cWow, even Trump\u2019s announcement for not using his resort is a commercial for his resort,\u201d said Colbert, who offered a slogan for Trump\u2019s Doral: \u201cYou know our motto: it\u2019s not just unbelievable \u2013 it\u2019s unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers\n\n\u201cWe say this a lot but it was true again today: Donald Trump talked to reporters and once again he lost his mind,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night. \u201cIn fact, you should just assume that\u2019s always the case. His mind has always been lost. At this point, it would be more shocking if CNN told us his mind had been found.\u201d\n\nScandals upon scandals have been the norm with the Trump presidency, but with the impeachment inquiry intensifying, \u201cit just feels like more is happening faster\u201d, said Meyers, who compared the administration to \u201cthe SportsCenter of scandals\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstead of having to keep track of a bunch of different scandals like we did for the first couple of years, now we\u2019re just getting all the highlights crammed together at once.\u201d\n\nTop of the list for scandals this week is Trump\u2019s now-reversed decision to host the G7 summit at his Doral resort \u2013 a choice he defended on Monday by citing its proximity to Miami international airport, which he claimed \u201csome say is the biggest [in the world]\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, some say it\u2019s the biggest?\u201d asked an astonished Meyers. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mystery, we can measure it.\u201d (A reporter noted on Twitter that it\u2019s not even in the top 20.)\n\n\u201cTrump talks about it like scientists have been working for years to discover the biggest airport,\u201d Meyers continued, \u201clike there are hieroglyphics written on a cave somewhere and archaeologists have been trying to decipher them in order to determine whether Miami is one of the biggest airports.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump and his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, defended the decision by saying that it wouldn\u2019t benefit Trump since they\u2019d do it at cost. Meyers called that claim a \u201csham\u201d since \u201cwe know from previous events at Trump resorts, that\u2019s not how it works\u201d. For example, at previous events at Trump properties, taxpayers have paid $546 a night for hotel rooms at Mar-a-Lago and $1,000 for liquor that White House staffers drank in one sitting.\n\n\u201cThe only way spending $1,000 for liquor in one sitting makes sense is if you are a White House staffer,\u201d Meyers said before pretending to morosely sip liquor as a staffer: \u201cThe other day he called the FBI because he couldn\u2019t find his remote control \u2026 we\u2019re all going to die in jail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, if taxpayers are going to spend a thousand bucks on booze then they should get to drink the booze themselves, especially if you have to deal with this president,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIn fact, every Trump tweet should come with an option to retweet, like, or send me a bottle of whiskey.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts dig into Trump\u2019s now-reversed decision to host the G7 summit at his own resort and his 71-minute press rant", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aca7cfa85f293e4df6397aece84a62aa94b40c6/95_0_1563_938/master/1563.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c861af8b593881d063eceef60e8df416", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
