GLOBAL MARKETS-Bond yields, stock prices supported ahead of central bank meetings\n\n* Value-oriented shares in U.S. suddenly in favour\n\n* Investors unwind their positions ahead of central bank meets\n\n* Bond yields rise, U.S. 10-year yield up 10 bps on Tues\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets held firm and bond yields rose on Wednesday as hopes of diminishing U.S.-China tensions and reduced risk of no-deal Brexit prompted investors to take profit in risk-off trade ahead of key central bank policy meetings.\n\nIn early trade, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.10% while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.32%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended little changed as a rally in energy and industrial shares countered a drop in the technology and real-estate sectors with investors favouring value over growth.\n\nThat represented a major reversal after many months of outperformance by growth shares such as tech shares.\n\n\"The sudden jump in value-oriented shares in the U.S. and elsewhere has all the hallmarks of position unwinding by major hedge funds,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) Securities.\n\n\"Such unwinding could continue for a few days but will likely end by the Fed's policy meeting.\"\n\nSuch reversals began last week after the announcement of U.S.-China trade talks in October and as the British parliament moved to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson from crashing the UK out of the European Union without a deal.\n\nPosition unwinding was also apparent in bond markets ahead of key central bank policy announcements including the European Central Bank on Thursday and the U.S. Federal Reserve next week.\n\nU.S. bond yields jumped on Wednesday, with the 10-year Treasuries yield rising more than 10 basis points to a one-month high of 1.745% .\n\nIt last stood at 1.726% in Asia. Japanese 10-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis point to minus 0.215% JP10YTN=JBTC while the Australian 10-year yield rose more than 5 basis points to six-week high of 1.142% .\n\nIn Europe, Germany's 30-year benchmark bond yield briefly broke into positive territory for the first time since Aug. 5.\n\nInvestors had bought bonds for many weeks on expectations that the ECB will dole out stimulus, with a cut in interest rates of at least 10 basis points fully priced in.\n\nSome traders also expect more measures including a deeper interest rate cut and a restart of its asset purchase programme.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also widely expected deliver an interest rate cut next week.\n\nGermany also signalled its readiness for relaxing its staunch opposition to deficit spending to support the economy, leading to speculation Berlin could issue more debt and curbing appetite for German bonds.\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday the country can counter a possible economic crisis by injecting billions of euros into the economy. the currency market, the dollar traded at 107.58 yen , having hit a six-week high of 107.63 earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThe euro stood little changed at $1.10485 , while the British pound stood at $1.2358 GBP=D4 , near its six-week high of $1.2385 hit earlier in the week.\n\nOil prices held firm near their highest levels in six weeks despite small losses on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump fired national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nDeparture of Bolton, who took a strident stance against Iran, raised speculation of improvement in U.S.-Iran relations and an eventual return of Iranian crude exports to the market.\n\nStill, the market was underpinned by Saudi Arabia's new energy minister's assurances of continued output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nIn addition, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are nowhere near subsiding after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his intention to annex a large swathe of the occupied West Bank, a move condemned by Arab League foreign ministers. crude futures rose 0.82% to $62.89 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.96% to $57.95 per barrel.\n\n(Editing by Stephen Coates)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Bond yields, stock prices supported ahead of central bank meetings", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA7D094_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
