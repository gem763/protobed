Or at least, we stopped wanting to look at it, and we stopped pretending to like it.\n\nThis feels true to me as someone who uses the internet every day, but I also know it\u2019s true because when The Verge partnered with Reticle Research to conduct a representative survey of Americans\u2019 attitudes towards tech\u2019s biggest power players, 15.4 percent of Facebook users said they \u201cgreatly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d disliked using the product, while 17 percent of Twitter users said the same. That made them the most disliked of the six companies in question, which also included Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. More than 10 percent of respondents described Facebook\u2019s effect on society as \u201cvery negative,\u201d and 10.5 percent said the same about Twitter \u2014 in both cases a higher number than the other four companies combined.\n\nThe survey doesn\u2019t reveal why Americans feel the way they do, but last December, writing about the impulse to call 2016 \u201cthe worst year ever,\u201d The New Yorker\u2019s Jia Tolentino articulated a pretty good guess as to why spending your time on the web\u2019s massive, news-saturated platforms might feel so bad: \u201cThere is no limit to the amount of misfortune a person can take in via the internet,\u201d she says. 2016 couldn\u2019t possibly be the worst year in history, Tolentino decided, but it was the year that convinced her the promise of the social media had been false, and that \u201cthe internet would only ever induce the sense of powerlessness that comes when the sphere of what a person can influence remains static, while the sphere of what can influence us seems to expand without limit, allowing no respite at all.\u201d\n\nThe consequences of connection were not part of what we were sold\n\nThe mainstream social internet is so big; everyone is connected to everyone, over a billion on Facebook alone. The consequences of connection \u2014 fake news, radicalization, massive targeted harassment campaigns, algorithmically-generated psychological torment, inane bullshit \u2014 were not part of what we were sold. We don\u2019t really have the option of moving our lives off of the internet, and coordinated boycotts of our monstrous platforms have been brief and mostly fruitless. But many of us found ways to renegotiate the terms of how we spent our time online. Rather than the enormous platforms that couldn\u2019t decide if, let alone how they had contributed to the election of a deranged narcissist or the rise of the virulently racist alt-right or a pending nuclear holocaust, why not something smaller, safer, more immediately useful?\n\nThe old promise of the internet \u2014 niche communities, human connection, people exchanging ideas, maybe even paying each other for the work they\u2019d made \u2014 never really lost its appeal, but this year it came back with a miniature vengeance.\n\nWe can see this longing for community \u2014 and specifically, the sort of small, weird communities that populated and defined the early internet \u2014 everywhere. There\u2019s Amino, the Tumblr-inspired app that lets fandoms build online spaces that are essentially club houses, then coordinate the creation of elaborate works of fan art, fiction, cosplay, and fandom lore. At the request of its largely teenage audience, the platform released its first cosplay yearbook this December, and doled out honors to the best writing, photography, and tutorials around cosplay. The thousands of fandom-specific rooms are lively and strange, each with their own moderators and byzantine rules.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the kids who are bending major platforms to their will, having their fun on Instagram but circumventing the intended use by making \u201cfinstagrams,\u201d separate, strange accounts that aren\u2019t tied to the Facebook social graph and therefore let users post weirder, funnier content they wouldn\u2019t share to everyone they know.\n\nIt\u2019s a direct precedent of the bonkers \u201cniche meme\u201d trend The Daily Beast\u2019s Taylor Lorenz detailed last month, wherein teenagers use MS Paint and Word Art aesthetics to write surreal diary entries structured as memes. Niche meme accounts aren\u2019t meant for a broad audience, and they\u2019re often anonymous. Sharing isn\u2019t about the likes; it\u2019s about \u201cfinding \u2018your people\u2019 on the massive sea of Instagram.\u201d One of the teenagers she interviewed told her, \u201cHaving this community of people who are like us helps us express our feelings and opinions that are usually just ignored.\u201d\n\n2017 saw the coming-of-age of Patreon, \u201cthe economic engine of internet culture\u201d\n\nAs political and economic uncertainty swirled around them, we also saw creatives making back-up plans in 2017. Patreon grew up this year, with missteps along the way, and in recognition of its success, Kickstarter launched the direct competitor Drip. My co-worker Adi Robertson called Patreon \u201cthe economic engine of internet culture\u201d in August, and explained how its model \u201cencourages people to see themselves not as consumers, but as members of a private club, free from the constraints of mainstream gatekeepers or mass-market appeal.\u201d That model can support podcasts, comics, art, memes, nudes, whatever people want to create, no matter how specific or strange, as long as there are people out there who want the same thing.\n\nPatreon provides a crucial place where the people who are making internet culture can to get paid for it and build small communities around their work. As beloved as Vine was, and Tumblr and SoundCloud still are, none of them ever found a meaningful way to reward and support artists. Getting money from a patron or subscriber lets weird, niche projects stay weird and niche, catered to a specific and modest audience, and saves artists from the gross chore of chasing the lowest common denominator and the millions of eyeballs you need to make real money from ads or sponsorship deals.\n\nThe appeal of a specific, engaged audience is also responsible for the return of community email. Newsletters distributed only through the \u201cphone tree\u201d friend-to-acquaintance-to-friendly-stranger model were wildly popular in the days of early email and early blogging, took a nearly two-decade break, then reappeared thanks to a Miranda July pet project, the buzzy 2012 email community Listserve, and most notably, the 2013 founding of TinyLetter. As part of a May 2017 New Yorker survey of the death of the public personal essay and the return of email newsletters, Awl alum Carrie Frye speculated that writers, and female writers in particular, have declared to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m going to make an Internet on which my essays go out in pneumatic tubes to just who I want them to go to, and no one else.\u201d Newsletters are an easy a way to build that tiny, private audience away from the ugliness of the internet at large. TinyLetter has a cap at 5,000 subscribers, and it has no discovery or explore section.\n\nOne of the more fascinating internet projects of this year, the briefly-lived platform Double Bounce married the subscriber-based structure of Patreon and the personalized distribution model of TinyLetter. You could only subscribe to an artist\u2019s work if the URL was shared directly, or in a different public space, and users could place whatever they wanted behind a paywall. It was an appealing prospect for creators with modest followings, especially those looking to \u201crefocus away from massive distribution sites that sell everything to advertising companies, [and] focus on smaller, more tight-knit communities.\u201d The basic idea was that not everyone needs to be an \u201cinternet megastar\u201d to prove that their work has value.\n\n\u201cI love the internet. Everything I ever liked came from the internet.\u201d\n\nDouble Bounce is shuttering at the end of the year, but it was good while it lasted. \u201cI love the internet. Everything I ever liked came from the internet,\u201d founder Alex Carusillo told me. \u201cThe internet when I was younger was just a bunch of weirdo strangers who were all weirdo strangers together and felt like a community for that.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t care if someone else brings the idea back to life; it\u2019s just something he thinks should exist.\n\nAdvocates of a weird, niche internet took other hits in 2017, the first full year without Vine and a crisis period for SoundCloud. Tumblr\u2019s future grew murkier this year, as it was acquired by Verizon and folded into a nightmarish mega-corporation. Then, in November, following months of silence and public absence, CEO and founder David Karp stepped down. Karp was abnormally beloved for a CEO, called \u201cdaddy\u201d for years by Tumblr\u2019s most active users, and without him, it would stand to reason that Tumblr now feels like a less special place. But communities are resilient and the mostly young, majority-female userbase of the platform had a great year regardless. They taught each other witchcraft in hopes of improving the dire political situation around them, even while the tools they\u2019d been taught in school (call your senators, read the news) were failing them. They doubled down on \u201cwholesome memes,\u201d a genre of internet humor where the joke is just \u201cthis is nice, whereas everything else is sarcastic or mean.\u201d They continued to be funnier than anyone I have met in real life.\n\nFor her expansive 2016 research project The Lonely City, writer Olivia Laing wandered New York alone and studied the artists who lived their lives on the fringes there \u2014 both those who were eventually celebrated and those who died in obscurity. Many of her subjects made their work during the AIDS crisis and were killed by the disease, or were otherwise neglected or tormented by the society they lived in. She argues, convincingly, that the fact of anyone\u2019s individual loneliness cannot be separated from the fact of the country they are trying to exist in. \u201cThe vicious circle by which loneliness proceeds does not happen in isolation, but rather as an interplay between the individual and the society in which they are embedded,\" she wrote.\n\nShe was talking about a specific American city, but her statement applies just as readily to the internet. It\u2019s a place. Much of what people have expected from traditional community structures \u2014 affirmation, information, a back-stop in the case of financial catastrophe or unwieldy loneliness \u2014 can feel more readily available online than it does in a society that seems to relish deepening the gulfs between us.\n\nI, for one, spent the vast majority of 2017 retreating into a tiny, email-based community of my own making, with a handful of charming strangers who shared my idiotic, overwrought affection for the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. All we ever did was share photos we\u2019d seen before and thank each other for existing, but I suspected we were responsible for each other in some slim, uncategorizable way.\n\nwe are responsible for each other in some slim, uncategorizable way\n\nAt The Verge, we used to argue amongst ourselves about whether internet culture was \u201cinternet culture\u201d or just \u201cculture.\u201d It now seems useful to debate whether the internet itself is \u201cthe internet\u201d or simply the world. For better and for worse, the latter proved itself to be true this year. The internet Nazis were real Nazis; they live in America. The #resistance was a sloppy but real and tangible resistance; it happened in America and it sometimes worked. The kids stormed McDonald\u2019s to scream about a Rick and Morty reference; the kids asked for help for their families.\n\nEvery banal, stupid thing you hate about living in the world is also something you can hate about the internet, and every good, vital thing that keeps you walking around without your face in your armpit is also on the internet. In that sense, the online world has ceased to be interesting. Here we are; it\u2019s where we live. I guess it is fitting that \u2014 just like the planet our bodies sit on \u2014 the whole thing is in immediate, grave peril.\n\nSo much of what happens to anyone, offline and online, is the fault of everyone \u2014 our collaborative structures, our massive platforms. The people in charge at Facebook and Twitter are just getting around to saying so, but the rest of us have made it clear that we already knew. \u201cLoneliness is personal, and it is also political,\u201d Laing concludes. \u201cLoneliness is collective; it is a city.\u201d The vast digital metropolis of the internet \u2014 that place that was supposed to make us feel never alone \u2014 failed us this year; we built what we needed on its outskirts.", "description": "Why tiny, weird online communities made a comeback in 2017", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany", "Dec"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKSkGUx-OIe5ydwbGdldNDy_YNo=/0x57:500x319/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9939291/tumblr_osfupn1sfP1wpnqymo1_500.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-28"}
