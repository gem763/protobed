The truth is that when it comes to crime and security, Giuliani knows jack shit. Jack Maple would have been the first to tell you that.\n\nMaple was the late crime-fighting genius who as a subway cop developed strategies that he implemented as an NYPD deputy commissioner to produce record reductions in violent felonies throughout the city during Giuliani\u2019s time as mayor. He was essentially given free rein by then-NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, who always bestowed credit where credit was due, but did not mind posing for the cover of Time magazine. A jealous Giuliani drove Bratton out and Maple departed with him.", "description": "He\u2019s paid big bucks by people all over the world for security advice that, history shows, he\u2019s unqualified to dispense.", "authors": ["Michael Daly", "Special Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571437701/191018-Daly-Rudy-tease_lltbzg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
