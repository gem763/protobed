All but one in the state have been reported in Maricopa County, according to the Arizona Republic.\n\n\"For whatever reason, Maricopa County seems to be the West Nile virus hot spot this season, and we honestly don't know why,\" Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, the Maricopa County Public Health Department's medical director for disease control, told the outlet.\n\nWHAT IS WEST NILE VIRUS? 3 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE MOSQUITIO-SPREAD AILMENT\n\n\"It is by far the most we've seen in the last decade,\" Sunenshine said. \"We're so dry and you don't think of us having a heavy mosquito population. Something is going on, and we're working with the CDC to figure it out.\"\n\nOfficials are studying bird and mosquito populations, as well as rainfall patterns and local ecology, to determine what\u2019s behind the increase.\n\nIn 2018, Arizona saw six deaths from West Nile virus, according to the Arizona Republic.\n\nMosquitoes are largely to blame for spreading West Nile virus. The insects become infected when they feed on infected birds. The virus can spread to humans if they\u2019re bitten by an infected mosquito, per the CDC.\n\nCONNECTICUT RESIDENT IS STATE'S FOURTH TO CONTRACT RARE TICK-BORNE ILLNESS LINKED TO BRAIN INFECTIONS, DEATH\n\nMost people who are infected do not experience symptoms, the CDC warns. However, a small percentage of people \u2013 roughly 1 in 5 \u2013 develop a fever and may additionally experience headaches, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash, among other signs of the virus. Even rarer, about 1 in 150 people who are infected with West Nile virus can develop a serious illness \u2013 such as inflammation of the spinal cord or brain \u2013 the CDC said.\n\nThere is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment to treat or prevent the virus. Those infected can take over the counter pain and fever reducers to alleviate symptoms. In severe cases, however, \u201cpatients often need to be hospitalized to receive supportive treatment, such as intravenous fluids, pain medication, and nursing care,\u201d according to the CDC.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic warns people who are older, as well as those with pre-existing medical conditions, are the most susceptible to the virus.", "description": "Arizona is leading the country this year in terms of West Nile virus\u00a0deaths, according to a recent\u00a0tally from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
