REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nThe S&P 500 eased back from a record high after a U.S. administration official told Reuters that Washington and Beijing were continuing to work on an interim trade agreement but that it may not be completed in time for the leaders of the two countries to sign in Chile next month.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a little bit of client sentiment that maybe risk assets have gone too far, you\u2019re going to see a little bit of a retracement,\u201d said Scott Lampard, head of global markets at HSBC Bank Canada. \u201cIt feels like it is more trading activity as opposed to anything more structural right now.\u201d\n\nThe loonie has rallied about 2% since early October, buoyed by robust domestic jobs data and investor optimism that a U.S.-China trade deal could boost Canada\u2019s commodity-linked economy.\n\n\u201cThose that have had a bullish Canadian dollar view and position have gotten some satisfaction the last number of weeks as the data in Canada has held up well,\u201d Lampard said.\n\nThe Bank of Canada is likely to keep interest rates steady at 1.75% on Wednesday in its first policy announcement since last week\u2019s federal election, despite signs that investors seeking higher-yielding currencies are shifting more money into Canadian dollars.\n\nThe Fed is also due to make an interest rate announcement on Wednesday. It is expected to lower the range for its policy rate to below the Bank of Canada\u2019s equivalent rate for the first time since December 2016.

The currency\u2019s weakest level of the session was 1.3096, while it touched its strongest level since July 22 at 1.3043.\n\nThe decline for the loonie came as the price of oil, one of Canada\u2019s major exports, lost ground for a second day.
