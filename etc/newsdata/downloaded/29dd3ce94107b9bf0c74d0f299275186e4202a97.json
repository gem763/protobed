Others remained upset, but not enough to quit. I put out an open call on Twitter for people who opposed SoulCycle\u2019s association with Trump to share their reasoning for sticking with the company. A cyclist in Philadelphia explained allegiances to particular instructors. Another in Los Angeles told me she had not ranted about the fundraiser online, but she also didn\u2019t feel guilt-free about continuing to attend classes she had already purchased.\n\nScholars who weighed in on the economic implications of unhappy customers for SoulCycle predicted that this sort of sentiment was common\u2014genuinely caring, but not enough to take action\u2014and that the boycott would not last. The day after the news broke, the Wharton professor Maurice Schweitzer predicted in Yahoo Lifestyle that executives would have \u201ca terrible week,\u201d but that the situation would not \u201cdo any long-term damage to the company.\u201d Paul Koku, a business professor at Florida Atlantic University, similarly told the publication, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will amount to much.\u201d\n\nOther skeptics accused the angry masses of \u201cslacktivism\u201d and \u201cvirtue signaling,\u201d suggesting that posting on social media can actually decrease a person\u2019s likelihood to take action. Making an enlightened statement gives a hit of dopamine that eases a person\u2019s inflamed sense of justice, and then that person simply moves on to the next issue in their feed.\n\nThe actual attendance numbers at SoulCycle classes, however, paint a different picture. It seems that many SoulCycle attendees have indeed stayed away\u2014even after the news faded.\n\nSoulCycle\u2019s attendance numbers were recently reviewed by Earnest Research, a data-analytics agency that tracks consumer behavior. SoulCycle\u2019s website makes the sign-up data for every class publicly available, and each class is scheduled individually and purchased either individually or in small packages\u2014there is no option for a monthly or annual membership\u2014so sign-up data can be followed in real time. (In the case of Equinox and other gyms that offer longer-term membership plans complete with early termination fees, any effect would be expected to lag.)\n\nEarnest compared sign-ups at locations across the United States over a period of 18 days before and 18 days after the fundraiser news. During that time, the average decline in sign-ups was 12.8 percent.", "description": "Most boycotts fail.
