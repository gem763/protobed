AA, -1.54% late Wednesday posted a wider-than-expected adjusted quarterly loss and announced a \"review\" of its smelting and refining capacity as well as asset sales to boost profits and lower costs. Alcoa said it lost $221 million, or $1.19 a share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $6 million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, Alcoa posted a loss of $82 million, or 44 cents a share, versus earnings of $154 million, or 82 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell to $2.6 billion from $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected an adjusted loss of 42 cents a share on sales of $2.6 billion. Alcoa said its \"multiyear portfolio review\" aims to refine its \"strategic priorities\" with an eye toward driving costs lower and achieving \"sustainable profitability.\" Most of the restructuring costs will be paid in the fourth quarter, with the remainder in the first quarter, and its new operating model is expected to result in about $60 million in annual savings starting in the second quarter. The asset sales are expected to generate $500 million to $1 billion in net proceeds, Alcoa said. The company kept its prediction of a deficit in the global aluminum market, and estimated lower global demand for aluminum for the year, versus a previous estimate of demand growth. \"The change is driven by weakening macroeconomic conditions, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and contracting manufacturing activity, especially in the global automotive sector,\" Alcoa said. For the alumina market, Alcoa projected a global surplus for 2019 that was slightly higher than the previous quarter's predictions. Shares of Alcoa rose 4% in the extended session after ending the regular trading day down 1.5%.", "description": "Alcoa Corp. late Wednesday posted a wider-than-expected adjusted quarterly loss and announced a \"review\" of its smelting and refining capacity as...", "authors": ["Claudia Assis"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
