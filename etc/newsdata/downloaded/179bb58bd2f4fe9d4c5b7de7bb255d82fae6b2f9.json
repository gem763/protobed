And when the money eventually ran out, Colin and Marta were forced to down tools before they could move in.\n\nSix years on however, with Colin and Marta now in residence, Kevin finally went to see the finished house - but those who tuned in were left underwhelmed by the big unveil.\n\n'It's called Grand Designs, not Normal Looking Houses,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'I normally really like the modern industrial look in Grand Designs, but this one is just really, really ugly.'\n\nKevin McCloud returned to Strathaven in Scotland to revisit Colin MacKinnon and his partner, Marta Briongos, who live in an air field house. Pictured, now complete\n\nThe couple's plan was to build an incredible metal sculptural home inspired by aircraft hangars right next to the runway - with an impressive interior to match. Pictured, the living room\n\nThe couple revealed that what was supposed to be a year-long project stretched into its third year - and well over budget. Pictured, one of the four bedrooms\n\nKevin told how the bright colours throughout the house reflected the couple's personality. Pictured, the living room\n\nWhile the house boasts stunning views of the runway (pictured), viewers were left less than impressed by the project\n\nThe bright kitchen (pictured) reflected the bold personalities of Colin and his partner, Marta\n\nDespite a six year battle to complete the project, viewers were underwhelmed bu the finished result (pictured)\n\nA third added: 'they\u2019ve f****** their budget building a massive shed,' while a further commented: 'What the bejesus is that monstrosity?'\n\nEver since he was a boy, Colin had been obsessed with flying, so when he inherited \u00a360, 000 back in 2005, he did what most aviation lovers could dream of \u2013 he built an airfield and set up his own flying school in Strathaven.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a lifestyle thing really,' explained Colin. 'It\u2019s not something you go into to make loads of money.\u2019\n\nDetermined to be closer to the airfield, the couple gained permission to build a new house tied to the business.\n\n'It's going to have two floors as we're going to have most of our living space on the first floor, which will give us a better view over the entire airfield,' Colin said, before the project began.\n\n'It's going to be a little bit like a control tower, but also living on the first floor will give us an element of privacy.'\n\nBut as the project proceeded, the 100 mph storms demanded a durable, robust building - so the couple set about having a 335 piece steel frame carefully designed and cross-braced to resist fearsome winds.\n\nIn 2011, Marta and Colin (pictured) started the construction of their new home on an exposed Scottish hilltop\n\nDescribing the robust house (pictured now) before it's built, Colin said: 'It's going to be a little bit like a control tower, but also living on the first floor it gives an element of privacy'\n\nPresenter Kevin was impressed by how 'sleek and pristine' the finished project is.' Pictured, the open plan kitchen and dining area\n\nSix years on from his first visit, Kevin went to see Colin and Marta's finished house in all its metallic glory. Pictured altogether\n\nThose who tuned in were left disappointed bu the ambitious build - with one comparing it to a 'corrugated card school project'\n\nThey planed to have the sides and roof of the house super insulated and to clad it in corrugated aluminum to help resist erosion.\n\nInside, the ground floor would boast a garage and four curved bedrooms with facilities. But viewers still seemed concerned about the durability of the pricey design.\n\n'I'd be interested to see how long that corrugated overhanging roof lasts in the storms up there,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'Wouldn't it be noisy as hell in the rain?'\n\nA third added: 'They are high up on exposed ground, the entire house is made of metal. I'd hate to be there when there's a thunderstorm.'\n\nPresenter Kevin McCloud (pictured) said how six years later the engineered space frame has become a home - something he described as 'magnificent'\n\nOthers viewers seemed concerned about the building material used - and weren't convinced it would last in poor weather conditions (pictured)\n\nThe couple also explained their desire to put in a slender spiral staircase that would lead to the first floor, which would become their elevated private apartment.\n\nIt would contain the master bedroom, a snug and the open plan centerpiece of their live-work home, while under the large glazed roof light on second floor, they hoped to put a painting room and office.\n\nBut with money tight and the elements against them, they set a rather ambitious \u00a3500, 000 budget for the entire project.\n\n'We were hoping to do the house without having to get a mortgage or borrowing any money because we'll have some money from selling our previous house,' said Marta.\n\nHowever, trouble soon struck when an expert ground worker they hired to do the foundations suddenly cancelled out of the blue.\n\n'The chap who was going to do the groundwork wasn\u2019t available until August and the steel work is coming in six days,\u2019 explained Marta.\n\nWhile the couple set out with a \u00a3500, 000 budget, they said they 'lost count' of what the total really cost\n\nThe spiral staircase (pictured) leads the eye up through three floors and offers spectacular views across the airfield\n\nSo in the true pioneering spirit of aviation, Colin decided to have a crash course in how to do the foundations himself.\n\n\u2018The great thing about the internet is that you can go online and get information on some of the biggest steel companies in the world,' he explained.\n\n\u2018The key thing is the accuracy of everything. Steel - you can\u2019t stretch it, squeeze it. You can\u2019t shave a bit off it very easily. It\u2019s been made very exact and precise.'\n\nOn hearing the plan, a shocked Kevin added: 'I often applaud people taking on new challenges, but this is eccentric.'\n\nIn August, two months into the project, the steel skeleton for their house was miraculously up - something which Kevin described as 'remarkable.'\n\nBut it wasn't long before the couple realised they were already \u00a340, 000 over what they'd planned to spend - and Colin was already waiting on \u00a3100, 000 from an insurance claim pay out he needed to finish his house.\n\nHis only sell-able assets were his previous paintings on display in their rented house and he decided to sacrifice some of them.\n\nThe couple revealed how trouble struck when an expert ground worker they hired to do the foundations suddenly cancelled out of the blue. Pictured, the narrow spiral staircase\n\nUpstairs features the master bedroom, a discrete bathroom, a snug TV room and bright galley with observation deck (pictured)\n\nWhile he reckoned the painting was worth \u00a340, 000, it sold for \u00a35, 000 less than he\u2019d hoped.\n\nAnd the couple were forced to halt the project after the insurance company released small amounts of money at a time, making project management near impossible.\n\nBut it seemed to them, at least, the hard work paid off, as when Kevin re-visited the now-completed build, he said the engineered space frame had finally become a 'magnificent' home which was 'sleek' and 'pristine.'\n\n'The now complete aluminium cladding really does covey the romance of the bold pioneers of aviation reaching for the sky,' added Kevin.\n\n'Despite the abundance of steel, indoors it is so remarkably well finished - with not a hint of condensation or rust.'\n\nHe went on to explain how the bottom deck of house is more functional - sensibly housing a utility room for stepping out of oily flight suits, and three circular guests bedrooms - each with a small, bright bathroom. And for views of the runway, it features a porthole.\n\nUpstairs, the circular open staircase leads the eye up three floors - which include the master bedroom, a discrete bathroom, a snug TV room and bright galley with observation deck.\n\nHowever, while delighted with the build, the couple, who have since received their \u00a3100, 000 insurance payout, revealed the project came at a cost.\n\n'Don't ask because I lost track,' said Marta. 'I started with a spreadsheet but halfway through the project I stopped. We don't know - and we disagree on the price we've spent.'", "description": "Grand Designs couple Colin MacKinnon and Marta Briongos built an airfield house on a Scottish hilltop with a budget of \u00a3500, 000.
