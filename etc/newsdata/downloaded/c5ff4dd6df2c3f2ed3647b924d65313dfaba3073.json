But September\u2019s figure was revised up to 126.3, so October counts as the third consecutive monthly decline.\n\nDespite the decline, consumer confidence remains high, according to Conference Board economist Lynn Franco.\n\n\u201cThere are no indications that consumers will curtail their holiday spending,\u201d Franco said.\n\nEconomists had forecast an improvement to 128.8.\n\nThe October confidence survey was a hodge-podge of mixed results. Those saying jobs are hard to get rose to 11.8 percent, up eight-tenths of a percentage point. But those saying jobs are plentiful rose by 2.4 percentage points to 46.9. The outlook for jobs, however, was notably dimmer, with 16.9 percent saying they see more job openings six-months from now and 17.8 percent saying they see fewer.\n\nExpectations for future income improved. A solid 21.1 percent of those surveyed expect income gains, up by 1.4 percentage points from Septe3mber, while just 6.5 percent expect their income to fall.\n\nConsumers\u2019 assessment of current conditions was also sunnier. Those claiming business conditions are \u201cgood\u201d increased from 37.4 percent to 39.2 percent, while those saying business conditions are \u201cbad\u201d decreased from 12.2 percent to 11.2 percent.\n\nConsumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity in the U.S. and confidence is closely watched this time of year for indications of holiday spending.\n\nThe recent numbers point to a healthy level of confidence and should stave off fears that a recession could occur in the near future.
