But he could see the slimmest margin of victory for a GOP presidential candidate in generations: In 2016, he won by 9 percentage points, while past Republican presidential candidates including Mitt Romney won the state by over 15 points in 2012.\n\nFor Republicans, the concern lies mostly with down-ballot races as well as party support among suburban and female voters, two groups that turned away from the party during the 2018 midterms.\n\n\u201cI expect President Trump to win Texas by 5 percentage points, not 9 points this time,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University. \u201cThere are long-term demographic changes taking place in the state that eat into Republican support. The major cities like Austin, Houston and Dallas are already leaning blue. Plus, his Republican coalition has been destabilized by his own actions and conduct.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign views Texas as friendly territory \u2014 among the handful of states alongside Florida, New York and California where the president can easily raise millions of dollars with a single fundraising event and speak to arenas packed with fans.\n\n\u201cNo one comes out for him like they do in Texas,\u201d said one Republican close to the White House. \u201cThe Dallas and Fort Worth area is always a slam-dunk for him. If he wanted to, he could stay down there for a whole week and raise $3 million a day.\u201d\n\nTrump on Thursday headlined a luncheon event in Fort Worth, where the top tickets went for $250,000 per couple, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO.\n\nTaking a photo with the president cost $25,000 per couple, with a single lunch ticket going for $2,800. Event chairs included major Texas names such as the Moncriefs, Marions, Boenkers, Dormans, Kleinheinzs and Dale Rogers.\n\nSupporters of President Donald Trump line up to enter a campaign rally Thursday. More\n\nAt a rally Thursday night at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Trump is expected to stay on message about the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2014 further developing his strategy of calling the impeachment inquiry a hoax which the Democrats have wanted to pursue ever since he won the election.\n\nA Republican adviser said Trump will also keep up his aggressive language to talk about his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe events give him a break from a relentless Washington news cycle where he\u2019s facing the Democratic impeachment inquiry and a parade of State Department and diplomatic witnesses testifying on Capitol Hill. At the same time, he is also facing backlash from his own party over his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Syrian border and abandoning the U.S.\u2019s longtime allies in the region, the Kurds.\n\nThursday\u2019s visit offers him a respite. \u201cTrump, throughout the election and the first three years of his presidency, has run a base strategy. Many presidents wouldn\u2019t bother to come to Texas, but he spends a lot of time in Florida, Alabama, Texas and other Southern states revving up the base to make sure that his support does not dissipate,\u201d Jillson said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t hold his base, he is cooked.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump faces a battle with his own party over Syria, a relentless impeachment fight and the steady loss of independent voters in swing states.
