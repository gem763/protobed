The dates have been corrected.\n\nGetty Images The internet led to the dominance of tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.\n\nWhat a difference half a century makes.\n\nOn Oct. 29, 1969, a UCLA computer science professor and a graduate student sent the first digital transmission from their computer to another one at the Stanford Research Institute.\n\nThat first \u201cL\u201d and \u201cO\u201d (intended to be \u201clogin,\u201d but the system crashed after sending the second letter of the word) sent across California through the ARPANET network of academic computers was the forerunner of the internet as we know it today.\n\nThat\u2019s opened the door for the texts and DMs, emails and cloud services, web pages and social media accounts, online shopping sites, mobile banking, cat videos and all of the other online activity and transactions that have us staring at our screens for more than 11 hours a day.\n\nThe internet also launched the tech boom (and 2000 bust, and later resurrection) that has spawned the first trillion-dollar U.S. public companies in Apple AAPL, -2.31%, Amazon AMZN, -0.81% and Microsoft MSFT, -0.94%.

Companies like Google GOOG, -2.12% have become a verb. And streaming services such as Netflix NFLX, -0.23% and Hulu have ushered in watching movies and TV on demand from anywhere, leading many cable customers to cut the cord \u2014 and spurring a battle of the streaming services that sees Disney DIS, -0.80% and Apple launching their own in November.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the internet gave birth to the FAANG stocks, and some highlights along the way that have defined modern life as we know it.", "description": "The first digital data transmission was sent between two computers half a century ago.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU253_apps_ZG_20191029145427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
