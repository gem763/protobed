I feel disrespected by someone I called a friend and by someone who stated they loved me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor 5 months I was naive, probably laughed at and made into a storyline that will forever haunt me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart hurts on so many levels,\u201d Jenni continued. \u201cOne thing I learned from tonight\u2019s episode is know your value.

This kid is 24 years old, he knows nothing about relationships,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s probably been in none in his entire life. And another thing, too, he doesn\u2019t know me. So what the f\u2014 is he doing? He\u2019s such a weirdo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you riding me about these things and you\u2019ve only known me for 20 minutes?\u201d Angelina added to Jenni\u2019s boyfriend. \u201cFrom now on, my sex life is none of anyone\u2019s business and what happens in my sex life is off-limits.\u201d\n\nView photos Jenni More\n\nRELATED: Jersey Shore: Angelina Slams JWoww\u2019s \u2018Weirdo\u2019 Boyfriend for \u2018Grilling\u2019 Her About Her Sex Life\n\nAngelina echoed her thoughts on Twitter Thursday night as the episode aired, writing, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between me telling the roomies about my sex life but I didn\u2019t know this kid from Adam.
