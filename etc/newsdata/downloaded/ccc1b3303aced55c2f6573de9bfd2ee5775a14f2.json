Circuit was responding to an emergency request from the Justice Department, which said in a court filing that it would be \u201cirreparably harmed\u201d without a stay and that \u201conce the information is disclosed, it cannot be recalled and the confidentiality of the grand jury information will be lost for all time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA three-judge panel paused the order pending further review but made clear it was not deciding the merits of the case.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,\u201d according to the brief order from Judges Patricia A. Millett, Cornelia T.L. Pillard and Robert L. Wilkins, who were all nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama.\n\nHouse lawyers had argued against a delay, telling the lower court that access to the grand jury materials is \u201cessential to its urgent impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWithholding disclosure would cause severe harm to the Committee and the public by depriving the House of information essential to its ongoing impeachment investigation,\u201d House lawyers said in a filing earlier Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nThe Justice Department is appealing a ruling Friday from U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell, who sided with House Democrats and said lawmakers are legally engaged in an impeachment process that exempts Congress from normal grand jury secrecy rules. The judge\u2019s initial order had given the department until Wednesday to disclose the material.\n\nHours after the appeals court issued its order, Howell formally ruled on the Justice Department\u2019s request for a stay that had initially come to her. She rejected the department\u2019s view that it would cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to release the material while the case is on appeal.\n\nAD\n\nIn July, the Judiciary Committee filed suit seeking an order for release of redacted portions of Mueller\u2019s 448-page final report on the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as grand jury materials cited or referenced by the report. The ruling ordered those materials released and said the House panel may also come back to court to seek additional material if needed.\n\nAD\n\nIn her opinion, Howell rejected arguments by committee Republicans that the House must first vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, calling the notion politically \u201cappealing\u201d but \u201cfatally flawed\u201d legally.\n\n\u201cEven in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Howell wrote. In the cases of all three presidents who faced such an action \u2014 Andrew Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton \u2014 the Judiciary Committee had begun investigating or received grand jury materials before a full House vote, the judge wrote.\n\nAD\n\nHouse lawyers said that the information will help the committee determine whether Trump \u201ccommitted impeachable offenses when he attempted to obstruct the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation\u201d and that the material is relevant to the investigation of the president\u2019s \u201csolicitation of Ukrainian interference in the 2020 Presidential election.\u201d", "description": "An appeals court, without ruling on merits of the case, temporarily paused a judge\u2019s ruling that would have conveyed materials in the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Ann E.
