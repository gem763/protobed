Avoiding the public comfort of a party line, Maher lights into the political excesses and orthodoxies of the left as well as the right, on an anti-P.C., antihypocrisy crusade that skewers Democrats and Republicans alike. \u201cMy whole career,\u201d Maher says, \u201chas been this battle: Why can\u2019t I talk on TV the way I talk at home or with my friends? My goal was to take that gap, which on most shows you can drive a truck through, and close it to nothing.\u201d\n\nMost late-night hosts don\u2019t criticize both the right and the left as much as you do. Why do you think that is? It\u2019s hard to answer that question without sounding self-serving. I will say this: Our studio audience is not representative of liberals across the country. Your paper and The Atlantic had long articles1 in the last year saying that 80 percent of Americans think this politically correct BS has gone too far. But the people on Twitter are the people who control the media a lot. They\u2019re the millennials who probably grew up with helicopter parents who afforded them a sense of entitlement. They are certainly more fragile than previous generations. Trigger warnings. Safe spaces. Crying rooms. Microaggressions. That crowd feels like anything that upsets their tender sensibilities is completely out of line.\n\nIsn\u2019t it important to distinguish between the fundamental arguments being made in favor of those sensibilities and the people being loudest on social media about them? Yes. The most important thing that the Democrats can do to win the next election is to broom this element out of their party and stand up to the Twitter mob and the ultrawoke. And I don\u2019t like the term \u201cwoke,\u201d because it implies I am asleep. I was woke before some of these people were born. I grew up in a household with two liberal parents who were ahead of their time.2 My father and mother told me about civil rights. I knew what the right thing was. The difference is that liberals protect people, and P.C. people protect feelings. They don\u2019t do anything. They\u2019re pointing at other people who are somehow falling short of their standards, which could have changed three weeks ago. They\u2019re constantly moving the goalposts so they can go, \u201cGotcha!\u201d For example, when I was growing up, the most liberal thing you could do is not see color. Well, that\u2019s wrong now. You see color, always, so you can register your white privilege. But I grew up in the Martin Luther King era: Judge by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. I still think that\u2019s the best way to do it. Not see it.\n\nBut we do see color, and no one is arguing that people shouldn\u2019t be judged by their character. So what problem is being caused by the shift you just described? If someone walks in the room, after a minute, I should not be thinking about color. And I am not. That\u2019s how I have always been. I have actual black friends. I don\u2019t think they want me to be always thinking: Black person. Black person. I\u2019m talking to a black person. Look, I tried to drive a stake through political correctness in the \u201990s.3 I obviously failed dismally. It\u2019s worse than ever.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about the negative effects of the \u201cTwitter mob\u201d on your show, but you\u2019ve also talked about how most people don\u2019t care what\u2019s on Twitter. If people don\u2019t care about the Twitter conversation, why bother railing against it? Because the Twitter-mob mentality has an effect on the rest of the world. Everyone fears the wrath of the Twitter mob and the social justice warriors and the P.C. police. Religions always talk about the one true religion. Now on the left we have the one true opinion. If you go against that, you do so at your peril. That\u2019s why the air on the left is becoming stale. I railed for years against the Fox News bubble, and that is as strong as ever, but I didn\u2019t think it would get this bad on the left. Comedians are afraid to make jokes in clubs, because somebody will tape it and send it out on Twitter and get the mob after you.\n\nThat\u2019s a concern we often hear from comedians these days. How much of that fear is coming from comedians still adjusting to the reality of there being possible consequences for their material? You can still make whatever joke you want. The difference is that more people are calling you out if they find it offensive. That\u2019s na\u00efve. You can make the joke if you don\u2019t mind giving up your career or being fired. Come on. The politically correct people are not concerned about social justice. They care about putting scalps on the wall. Liam Neeson. Remember that?4 Are we at this place where we can\u2019t admit that we\u2019ve ever had bad thoughts and gotten over them and become a better person? You can\u2019t judge today by yesterday. We evolve.\n\nBill Maher at The Improv in Hollywood in the early 1980\u2019s. From Bill Maher\n\nLet\u2019s take the Liam Neeson thing. Who I don\u2019t even like, by the way.\n\nWhat\u2019s your problem with Liam Neeson? He\u2019s for horse-drawn carriages in Central Park. And I\u2019m a PETA board member.\n\nI didn\u2019t know that. But the controversy around him was a story for a day, and then the world moved on. His career is fine, isn\u2019t it? The world doesn\u2019t move on for Megyn Kelly5 and Roseanne,6 and Aziz Ansari7 had to fly below the radar for a year. I think you\u2019re downplaying how serious this stuff is. We live in an age where people want to cancel other people and disappear them. Who\u2019s going to be left?\n\nYou\u2019ve had two big controversies during your career. The first was in 2001 when you said that the 9/11 hijackers were not cowards.8 The second was two years ago, when you made that joke using the N-word.9 Did it feel different to be at the center of a controversy during the social media era? Controversies are never pleasant to go through. On the second controversy, I\u2019m saving an in-depth discussion for my memoirs. If we were living in a country that could handle nuance, I\u2019d be happy to talk about it, but we\u2019re no longer in that country. There\u2019s no winning there. You\u2019re going to have to read my memoirs. We live in an era where I don\u2019t think people\u2019s main focus is the truth and/or sussing out something valuable or teachable. We live in a time in which people are more concerned with scalps and clicks.\n\nDid the discussion that happened after you made that joke reveal anything new to you about our culture\u2019s or your own understanding of that language? I just think there\u2019s no way to have that conversation with you, David. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t blame you for trying. It\u2019s a shame, because there is lots of learning that can be happening. As I said at the time, anytime someone is hurt by a word like that you have my sincere apology. But that\u2019s the beginning of a discussion, and it\u2019s too bad that we don\u2019t live in a place where you can have the end of it.\n\nWell, so my next question is related to the 9/11 controversy. You\u2019ve always been critical of all religions, but is there something distinct about your criticism of Islam? Fairly or not, you\u2019ve been called an Islamophobe a few times over the years. It\u2019s ridiculous to label criticism of a religion as a phobia of a religion. I\u2019m going to criticize any person or group that violates liberal principles, and so should you. Almost all religions, by their nature, are intolerant and supremacist. At any time in history one religion will be the most fundamentalist. At this moment I think it\u2019s pretty evident that religion is Islam. Of course, intolerance exists everywhere, but the places where, let\u2019s say, human rights workers have their work cut out for them the most are probably traditional Islamic societies. To conflate thinking that with Islamophobia is a facile and unconvincing trick.\n\nI do wonder if, at least in the past, you\u2019ve done some conflating of your own as far as, for example, treating theocracies or dictators as exemplars of Islamic rank and file. I think you have it backwards. The government of Pakistan is more liberal than the people. Their senate recently passed legislation to end child marriages and local police forces have intervened. Yes, we have things in our country that are at odds with liberal values, but someone once said that, at some point, a difference in degree becomes a difference in kind. It\u2019s frustrating for me. I know that people who ask me these questions actually agree with me, and yet they\u2019re like, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d It\u2019s like, Can I just be real?\n\nMaher with Johnny Carson on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in 1985. Ron Tom/NBCU Photo Bank, via Getty Images\n\nIt could be that there are complexities that your criticisms of Islam don\u2019t address. There are many factors, none of which I\u2019ve ever denied. Poverty has been shown to have little to do with terrorism. You can always bring in a million things to make this look like a phobia. \u201cBut what about white supremacy?\u201d Also a bad thing! Never said it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s interesting to me that even the people who criticize me about this sometimes have used the word cancer. As in, \u201cIslamism is a cancer upon Islam.\u201d And to those who say, when I mention instances of Islamism, \u201cBut it\u2019s not everywhere,\u201d I say, \u201cIf a doctor tells you you have cancer, do you go, Yeah, but it\u2019s not everywhere?\u201d\n\nDo you see any way out of this cultural and political tailspin we\u2019re in right now, in which everyone\u2019s default stance is \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with me, then screw you?\u201d You have to find a way to begin with what you share and then explore why you differ so vehemently on other issues, and that\u2019s what we seem to have lost the ability to do. I don\u2019t see a lot of desire for people to talk to each other, to accept that, \u201cO.K., this person doesn\u2019t agree with me on a lot of stuff, but I don\u2019t have to think he\u2019s a monster.\u201d We want to beat our chests and vanquish the other side. Compromise seems like a dead concept.\n\nOn the \u201cReal Time\u201d anniversary special last year, the things people were saying about why they like you \u2014 especially your fearlessness about saying what you really think \u2014 reminded me of the things people say about why they like President Trump, whom you\u2019re no fan of.10 Is there any way to productively channel people\u2019s enthusiasm for those qualities? So much of it seems like it\u2019s mostly about the pleasure we get from seeing our opponents insulted. During the second year of \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d we had a contest: \u201cPolitically incorrect or just stupid?\u201d We were trying to make the point that saying something that\u2019s contrary is not necessarily politically incorrect. It\u2019s sometimes just stupid. I define political correctness as the elevation of sensitivity over truth. That\u2019s my beef with it. We\u2019re not getting to the truth, because we\u2019re too sensitive.\n\nLet me totally switch subjects. I went and read your novel.11 I\u2019m verklempt. That\u2019s something no interviewer has ever said to me.\n\nIt has this lovingly detailed evocation of a very particular time in the comedy world, back when the boom was starting to happen in the late \u201970s, and how that was a real moment of change for comedians and their work. Have you seen any similar sea changes since? I\u2019m probably not the best one to ask, because it has been a long time since I was in the comedy clubs. I do hear a lot of complaints that comedians are frustrated that they can\u2019t freely try out new bits. When I was coming up, the great thing about the comedy clubs was that they were laboratories for our experimentation. That was the deal. They didn\u2019t pay us, and we didn\u2019t have to be good \u2014 and weren\u2019t \u2014 but that\u2019s how we honed our craft. Now people are afraid, and comedy does not function well in that atmosphere of fear. We want to be saying whatever, especially if it\u2019s funny, and it hurts us that the audience won\u2019t trust us. Do you really think I\u2019m on the side of the bad people? Chris Rock, Larry the Cable Guy and Jerry Seinfeld a few years ago all were talking about the fact that they don\u2019t work campuses anymore. Jerry Seinfeld is too out there? His act is so clean it whitens teeth. Comedy is about saying those true things that everyone else isn\u2019t saying. That\u2019s where the fun is.\n\nYou mentioned colleges. Students are another group that you talk a lot about on the show. There has been no time over the last 50 or so years when people haven\u2019t been criticizing college kids\u2019 social and political ideas. But isn\u2019t that a reaction to the fact that college is a place where students are pushing hard and figuring out their ideas about the world? Isn\u2019t that what these kids are supposed to be doing at that age and in that setting? I don\u2019t think someone who\u2019s at Harvard is a child, and I do think they should know that everybody in America gets a lawyer. Yet they did not understand that.12\n\nMaher with guests, including Jerry Seinfeld, on \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d. Everett Collection\n\nThe students at Harvard weren\u2019t saying Harvey Weinsten wasn\u2019t entitled to a lawyer. They were objecting to a residential dean being his lawyer. That\u2019s different. Well, that\u2019s wrong, too. Everybody gets the lawyer that they want. Harvard doesn\u2019t understand the very basis of the Sixth Amendment? I don\u2019t think a lot of us who are criticizing that are criticizing the kids as much as the administrators.\n\nWho you think are spineless. Very spineless. The way parents have been spineless in disciplining their kids. When I was growing up you could never drive a wedge between your parents and the teacher. Now the parents always back their precious darlings, and that\u2019s why you have grade inflation and kids who leave school without knowing anything. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault that he doesn\u2019t know anything. It\u2019s the teacher\u2019s fault.\u201d That\u2019s not helping our country. Being brought up this way is going to lead these kids to ruin. Of course, they\u2019re not all brought up the same way. I don\u2019t think in the middle of the country they\u2019re raising their kids like that. I saw Mario Lopez got in trouble, did you see that?\n\nI didn\u2019t. I saw this headline: \u201cMario Lopez Apologizes.\u201d It was this groveling apology to the L.G.B.T.Q. community. You know what the problem was? They asked him about this trend in Hollywood of letting your 3-year-old decide their gender and Mario Lopez said maybe 3 is a little young for that decision.13 Monster!\n\nThis is making me think of when you had Dr. Debra Soh14 on the show talking about gender dysphoria, and you were pointing to what you see as the problem of parental permissiveness towards gender identification and transitioning. You were saying that parents let their kids gender reidentify because it\u2019s easier than telling them not to. That seemed pretty glib. It was.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit hard to imagine that parents who support a child\u2019s transitioning are doing it because they think it\u2019s the easier path. That\u2019s not true. I know people who\u2019ve done it, and that is exactly what it is. They never discipline their kids. They think they\u2019re making it easier by giving the kid what they want. I mean, you\u2019re right, what I said was glib, but I am serving many masters. \u201cReal Time\u201d is an entertainment show on an entertainment network, and I\u2019m a comedian. Not everything I say can stand up to the scrutiny of the ultimate fact-check. But I think that there is some truth to this. There are kids \u2014 and this is what Dr. Soh was saying and I wasn\u2019t disagreeing with \u2014 who have transitioned who were really just gay. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst thing in the world to wait a few years to find out what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m not a doctor. I\u2019m not a scientist. But if I had a kid I would tell them: \u201cAs long as you\u2019re living under my roof you\u2019re not cutting anything off. Until you\u2019re 18. Then you cut off whatever you want.\u201d Here I am, being glib again.\n\nWhat\u2019s something encouraging to you about millennials? And what\u2019s the most disappointing thing about your own generation? Aside from ruining the world environmentally. We\u2019ve left a dark, stinking husk of a planet, haven\u2019t we? My generation started this mess. The Baby Boomers were the first \u201cMe\u201d generation. They were the first spoiled kids. There definitely was more discipline, but there was also more indulgence, and that seemed to continue on and on. So I think we have to look in the mirror as to when that trend started. As for the most encouraging thing about millennials, it\u2019s idealism. You need people to look at anything with a fresh pair of eyes. That sort of idealism is essential to temper the necessary cynicism.\n\nMaher on \u201cReal Time,\u201d his show on HBO, this year with guests including Salman Rushdie, to his right, and Chelsea Handler. Janet Van Ham/HBO\n\nAnd you don\u2019t see any idealism in the identity politics of younger people? I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s connected to idealism. What I\u2019m complaining about is fragility. What I\u2019m complaining about is people who were overindulged as children and somehow believe that they should not have to endure even the slightest measure of discomfort.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m overly Pollyanna-ish about all this, and obviously not everyone is arguing these issues in good faith, but isn\u2019t the root of what you\u2019re identifying just people\u2019s attempt to figure out how to get through life with more dignity and less pain? But there are negative repercussions. People get disappeared. When I was a young person the conservatives were the ones who \u2014 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call it.\n\nDrew hard lines about what was or wasn\u2019t culturally acceptable? Thank you, yes. Now it\u2019s reversed, and I feel like that\u2019s backwards. Young people should be the free ones pushing the boundaries and not the ones inhibiting us. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a woman, so I could not possibly know that experience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a person of color, so I can\u2019t speak about that.\u201d Professors are afraid to speak, because what they say, even if it\u2019s science, might go against the politically correct notion. This is pernicious. I\u2019m sorry, but I have to lay that at the doorstep of the far left and the younger generation. It\u2019s not the worst thing in the world to hear something you find somewhat offensive. You can turn the channel. Look at something else. Go to a puppet show; you\u2019ll never be offended.\n\nI\u2019m curious about how your own comedy has evolved. Back when you were doing \u201cPolitically Incorrect\u201d you used to do a lot more hubba hubba jokes about women. It\u2019s funny you mention that. When I turned 50, I had a talk with my writers and I said, \u201cno more I\u2019m-in-the-hot-tub-with-twins jokes.\u201d Back in the \u201990s it was a different point of view to say, \u201cI\u2019m single, and that is not a bad choice.\u201d I stood up for that idea \u2014 and it was not well accepted at the time \u2014 that you can have children, that\u2019s fine, but I do not want them. I was a bit of a militant single person. But when I was 50, I said, \u201cI\u2019m too old to be doing these jokes.\u201d At a certain point it\u2019s not funny anymore. It\u2019s creepy. I never did those kind of jokes again.\n\nDo you still have a stripper pole in your house? It\u2019s not in my house.\n\nGuest house? Well, yes. I bought my house in 2001, and in 2004 my next-door neighbor was selling his bachelor pad. He had a small house he lived in, and there was this other little bungalow on the property that I use if I have a party. I don\u2019t know how you knew that I had a stripper pole put in.\n\nLet me ask you a nonpolitics, noncomedy question. I know that you\u2019re a big Beatles fan. In one of your books you said you could probably do a better job interviewing them than anybody has yet. I definitely could.\n\nSo if you could snap your fingers and have Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr on your show, what would you ask them? I would love to present my theory as to why the Beatles really broke up. Which is that John Lennon could not keep up in the battle for A-sides. Imagine writing a song as great as \u201cRevolution\u201d and it loses out to \u201cHey Jude.\u201d That\u2019s, I think, why John Lennon didn\u2019t want to continue going with the Beatles. I don\u2019t think he liked losing. Paul McCartney would never admit that, by the way.\n\nWell, there you go. O.K., back to your work! For more than 25 years you\u2019ve been going on TV and making jokes about Republicans being hypocritical and corrupt and Democrats being too PC and lacking backbone. Does it ever feel like you\u2019re banging your head against a wall? These people don\u2019t change. Yes but I never thought that people would hear my jokes and go: \u201cHe\u2019s right! I\u2019ve got to amend my behavior right now.\u201d But I\u2019m very fortunate as a standup comedian who still goes on the road a lot, because I\u2019m always given new material. I had John Boehner jokes, and now I have Mitch McConnell jokes.\n\nI wonder if you could get away with Mad-Libbing your material. Just swap new names into old jokes. I have repurposed junk. I think I had one about Newt Gingrich having the moral compass of an opportunistic infection. Who doesn\u2019t that apply to? I have a plethora of material, but if an old joke perfectly fits somewhere I\u2019m not above repurposing. You know, John Lennon wrote a song called \u201cChild of Nature,\u201d and it was a great tune. He repurposed it with different lyrics a few years later as \u201cJealous Guy.\u201d Artists are blue jays. We find little scraps here and there and build a nest. We\u2019re shameless about it.", "description": "\u201cReligions always talk about the one true religion.
