To mark the debut of iPadOS, which starts on version 13 for continuity\u2019s sake, here are the best features you can use on an iPad but not an iPhone.\n\nAdd widgets to the home screen\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\niPadOS becomes Android! Sort of. With a swipe to the right on the home screen, you can bring the Today View widgets into view, and keep them there, if you want \u2014 just toggle the switch under Home Screen Layout on the Display & Brightness tab of Settings.\n\nYou can have iPadOS show smaller or bigger icons on the home screen as well, depending on how you want to use all that iPad screen space: Just choose More or Bigger under Home Screen Layout on the same Settings tab. Widgets can\u2019t be pinned to the home screen in the Bigger mode, but they can still be viewed with a swipe to the right.\n\nUse your iPad as a second display\n\niPadOS and a new feature called Sidecar allow an iPad to be used as a wired or wireless secondary display (complete with software Touch Bar) for any Mac running macOS Catalina \u2014 you can even use the Apple Pencil as a makeshift trackpad or mouse on your iPad when in Sidecar mode. The easiest way to launch Sidecar, once your iPad and Mac are on the same wifi network or connected together, is to open up the AirPlay devices list from the macOS menu.\n\nNavigate from the Dock\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\nThe Dock was around before iPadOS, but it remains one of the best iPad-only features \u2014 a Mac-style navigation bar for launching apps and accessing the various multitasking options in iPadOS.\n\nLong press on an app icon, then choose Rearrange apps and drag the icon down to the bottom of the screen to pin it to the Dock. The Dock is always visible on the home screens and can be brought up when hidden with a quick swipe up from the bottom of the display.\n\nWith iPadOS, you can create folders of app icons as well, just as you would on one of the home screens \u2014 drag one app on top of another to create a folder.\n\nRun apps in Split View\n\nThe Dock is also the key to Split View: With one app on screen, tap and drag another app icon to the left or the right-hand edge of the display, then use the black bar in between the two apps to decide what sort of screen split you want to have.\n\nCertain apps, including Notes, Mail and Safari, now support multiple windows. Try dragging a note entry, or an email conversation, or a Safari tab over to the side of the screen, and you\u2019ll see Split View is enabled \u2014 very handy if, for example, you\u2019re trying to take notes from two webpages at once.\n\nRun apps in Slide Over\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\nSlide Over gets some extra multitasking abilities in iPadOS. You can drag an app up from the Dock to the right or left (but not quite the edge of the screen) to put it into Slide Over mode, as before. Yet now a swipe up on the Slide Over sidebar brings up all the apps you\u2019ve recently used in this mode. To switch quickly between the two most recently used Slide Over apps, swipe across the bar at the bottom.\n\nMake use of drag and drop\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got all your apps up in multiple windows, side by side \u2014 squint your eyes and it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re using a laptop \u2014 you can drag and drop pictures and links from one app to another. Tap and hold on something you want to transfer, then move it over to the app on the other side of the screen.\n\nMove the keyboard\n\nScreenshot: Gizmodo\n\nWith iPadOS, you can pick up and drag the keyboard, then position it wherever you want on screen. Use a two-finger pinch to make the keyboard portable, then a two-finger drag-and-drop (or the bar at the bottom) to move it around, then a two-finger expand gesture to put the keyboard back where it was again.\n\nBrowse files in column view\n\nThe Files app on iPadOS supports more views than the Files app on iPhone: When you\u2019re inside a folder, drag down from the top right-hand corner of that folder (not the screen as a whole) to reveal more display options. You can pick from grid, list, and column views, with that last one making it much easier to dive deep into several subfolders on your iPad.\n\nThe column view also activates a window on the far right of the interface that previews certain file types, including images and some documents. When one of these files is selected, iPadOS lets you access certain quick actions too \u2014 rotating or annotating images, for example.\n\nBrowse websites in desktop mode\n\nOne of the biggest differences between using a laptop and using an iPad is that you don\u2019t get the full desktop web experience with Apple tablets. Apple is trying to do something about that by adding a desktop mode to Safari on iPadOS.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not perfect \u2014 Apple is applying some under-the-hood tricks to get desktop sites looking better in iPadOS Safari, and the lack of a pointing device is keenly felt on some sites \u2014 it works well for sites like Google Docs and WordPress.\n\nUse the Apple Pencil\n\nYou can use the Apple Pencil as a super-accurate, super-sensitive stylus on the iPad; you cannot, as yet, use it with the iPhone.", "description": "The big iPad-exclusive features (like the Dock) first started appearing in iOS 11, and now Apple\u2019s tablets have a whole separate mobile operating system to call their own.
