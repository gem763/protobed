If supported by European leaders, the agreement will go to the House of Commons for a vote on Saturday.\n\nWhile the Republic of Ireland is satisfied with the arrangments, the conservative, unionist DUP has said its MPs will not vote for the deal in parliament. The party said in a statement this afternoon: \u201cFollowing confirmation that the prime minister now believes that he has secured a \u2018great new deal\u2019 with the European Union, the Democratic Unionist Party is unable to support these proposals in parliament.\u201d\n\nThe leftist Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Labour, and the Liberal Democrats \u2014 which all have in their party manifestoes strong, anti-Brexit stances \u2014 have said they will not back the deal on Saturday.\n\nBREAKING \"It doesn't meet our demands and expectations.\" @jeremycorbyn says Labour is 'unhappy' with @BorisJohnson's deal and 'as it stands' the party will vote against it.

If this was to be agreed, we then enter into years more negotiations for the prize of a free trade agreement which we already know we will not get unless we surrender our territorial fishing waters and will not get unless we stay in regulatory alignment with the European Union.\u201d\n\nMr Farage added that the deal would mean the UK surrendering autonomy on making her own laws on employment regulations and the environment, as well as signing up the country to foreign policy and military policy commitments.\n\nThe Brexit Party leader said that he would \u201cprefer to have an extension\u201d \u2014 another Brexit delay \u2014 \u201cand a general election\u201d than \u201caccept a new European treaty\u201d.\n\n\u201cI would genuinely believe that a clean break and being able to be competitive is the absolute key to our future economic success. We cannot do that with this new treaty. We will never be able to properly break free of the EU if we sign up to this,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe commitment to regulatory alignment in this agreement means that the \u201cnew deal\u201d is not Brexit, despite improvements on the customs union. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 17, 2019\n\nThe Conservative Party\u2019s European Research Group (ERG) has been rallying around the prime minister in recent weeks over his efforts to negotiate a new deal, even while the hardcore \u201cSpartans\u201d remain in favour of a clean-break Brexit. However, no official statement has come from its chairman, Steve Baker, or deputy, Mark Francois, on their position on the deal to date.\n\nHowever, ERG member Nigel Dodds implied that some members of the ERG had changed position and were open to backing a new deal.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday morning, Mr Dodds said that \u201csome of the mood music now coming from people like Steven Baker is completely different to where we were just a couple of months ago\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the colossal achievement of where we now are,\u201d the ERG member said praising the deal, adding: \u201cWho would have thought that from when I last chatted to you a few days ago we would now be on the cusp of an agreement?\u201d\n\nWhile last night, Mr Francois hinted that the ERG would not automatically vote the same way as the DUP. Telling Sky News that the ERG is not a \u201cStalinist group\u201d and members were free to \u201clook into their conscience\u201d to decide how to vote, he said: \u201dThe ERG and the DUP have always been firm allies all the way through this process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not axiomatic that we would automatically vote the same way as them, but particularly as these arrangements have strong implications for Northern Ireland, we would give very strong weight to whatever the DUP say.\u201d\n\nFormer Conservative Party leader and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said, \u201cI\u2019m reserving my position\u201d on whether or not to vote for the deal \u201cbecause I really want to read what\u2019s in it\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to know how quickly can we get to a free trade agreement, how quickly can we, therefore, get out, what incentive is there for the EU to do this quickly? And is the political declaration exclusively for free trade?\u201d he said.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons and former ERG chief Jacob Rees-Mogg threw his support behind the deal, urging MPs to vote for it.", "description": "Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said that the deal agreed between Boris Johnson and the EU is \"just not Brexit\".", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nigel-Farage-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
