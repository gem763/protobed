So only naturally, we turned straight to Appendix E: Executive remuneration, the first year that board and key management personnel compensation has been broken out.\n\nBefore quitting with immediate effect and joining disability care provider Zenitas, de Luca was drawing an annual salary of $704,689. One of de Luca\u2019s deputies Vicki Rundle became acting CEO (where she remains) on April 30. She was paid $432,168 for the year.\n\nAnd despite her seniority during two months of higher duties, Rundle was out-earned by her fellow deputy CEO Michael Francis ($453,451), who resigned in July and finished last month; and by Head of Markets Antonia Albanese ($460,120), who joined de Luca at Zenitas in July; and even by her Head of People Hamish Aikman, who took home $481,281. For human resources! If ever an organisational function was ripe for automation\u2026\n\nBut she wasn't out-earned by the other deputy CEO Anthony Vella ($427,715), who quit in July and joined de Luca in August.\n\nYep, four of the NDIA\u2019s eight most senior executives \u2013 the CEO included \u2013 have left in six months flat. Chaos. What kind of show is chairman Helen Nugent ($158,801) running here?!", "description": "Four of the NDIA\u2019s eight most senior executives \u2013 the CEO included \u2013 have left in six months flat.
