(Picture: Moose Photos)\n\nIf you\u2019ve woken up in a state of confusion today wondering what time it is and if the clocks went back last night, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nIt may happen twice every year in the UK, but the bi-annual changing of the clocks to go either backwards or forwards for Daylight Savings seems to throw us every time.\n\nThis is when the clocks went back last night and when you can expect them to go forwards again \u2013 so you can mark it in your diary in advance for 2020.\n\nDid the clocks go back last night?\n\nYup, the clocks did indeed go back very early this morning on Sunday 27 October 2019.\n\nThe time changed at 2am Greenwich Mean Time overnight meaning that at 2am it became 1am GMT instead.\n\nThis might mean that you got to enjoy an extra hour of sleep this morning \u2013 maybe without even realising it.\n\nNothing better than an extra hour of sleep on a Sunday.
