You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThat\u2019s an awful lot of non-biodegradable polluting junk, some of which inevitably ends up in landfill or, worse still, in our oceans.\n\nAs well as the 50 per cent reduction, and a promise of an absolute cut of 100,000 tonnes, there\u2019s also a pledge to help collect and process more plastic packaging than the company sells by 2025, to share tech, and to use a lot more recycled and recyclable material.\n\nSuch promises will require Unilever to expend money, manpower and creativity on innovating. Not only has it pledged to do that, but it also says it\u2019s willing to share what it comes up with if that will help clean up the planet.\n\nAs you might expect, the announcement of all this was accompanied by what you might call a full-court PR press. Unilever likes to be seen as an exemplar of a better sort of capitalism, a company that can do cuddles.\n\nThis took something of a knock after it fended off an unwanted takeover by America\u2019s rapacious Kraft Foods by promising the City a fancy cost-cutting package that had unions up in arms.\n\nIt also nettled its investors with a proposal (subsequently withdrawn) to move its HQ from London to Rotterdam, which would have forced it out of the FTSE 100, and required tracker funds and some others to divest as a result.\n\nDoes this mean the hugs are back?\n\nUp to a point. If you look past the PR blarney you\u2019ll see that several companies have already made similar pledges. Unilever\u2019s is more aggressive than, say, that of its rival Proctor & Gamble (Fairy Liquid, Lenor), which said it planned to halve plastic use by 2030, but the point remains.\n\nUnilever\u2019s move is also motivated by pragmatism as much as it is by a desire to do the right thing. Plastic is environmentally destructive. There are umpteen tonnes of stuff floating in our oceans. It\u2019s damaging to our health too. That\u2019s a message that\u2019s getting home to consumers, and they\u2019re calling for change, particularly younger consumers who hold the key to the company\u2019s future and are inclined to vote with their wallets.\n\nSo Unilever is playing follower here as much as it is leading the debate.\n\nSome of the comments CEO Alan Jope made to the BBC were also less than helpful. He said plastic was still \u201ca terrific material\u201d and jabbed at others, such as local authorities, which he said needed to harmonise recycling policies and make instructions clearer to consumers.\n\nWhile he\u2019s right about that, we\u2019re supposed to be talking about Unilever here and what it can do. Poorly funded councils wouldn\u2019t need to be pressured if it produced less of the stuff for them to recycle.\n\nThis is a point made by Greenpeace. It concedes that the move is a step in the right direction. But it is concerned about Unilever\u2019s \u201ccontinued emphasis on collection, alternative materials, and recycled content\u201d when it says there is a need for a \u201csystemic shift required to solve the growing plastic pollution problem\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It employs a lot of clever people and has financial clout. And it is looking at the problem globally.\n\nStill, while this is indeed, as Greenpeace says, a welcome step, it\u2019s two cheers with the potential for a third if that innovative effort can make a serious, and provable, dent in what is rapidly moving from \u201cserious problem\u201d to \u201cglobal crisis\u201d.", "description": "*/ Plastic fantastic?", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/10/23/12/unilever.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
