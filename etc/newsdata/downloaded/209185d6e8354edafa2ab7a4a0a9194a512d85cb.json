Joe Biden and Beto O'Rourke do well among Klobuchar fans as well, with their satisfaction rates coming in generally about 10 percentage points higher than usual.\n\nINSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n\nRead more about how we're polling this here.\n\nWhat are Amy Klobuchar's policy positions?\n\nWhat are Amy Klobuchar's political successes?\n\nKlobuchar's first foray into politics was successfully lobbying for the enactment of a Minnesota law that required insurance plans to cover new mothers being able to stay in the hospital 48 hours after giving birth.\n\nIn 2016, Klobuchar sponsored or co-sponsored 27 bills that were signed into law, more than any other senator that year.\n\nTwo bipartisan bills Klobuchar introduced to combat the opioid crisis in 2018 were passed and signed into law.\n\nKlobuchar was the lead author of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which banned lead in children's products, among other provisions. She described it as the \"most sweeping reform\" of consumer product safety law in \"decades.\"\n\nHow much money has Amy Klobuchar raised?\n\nKlobuchar has raised$5.2 million between announcing her campaign on February 10 and the end of 2019's first fundraising quarter on March 31.\n\nKlobuchar raised $3.9 million in 2019's second quarter from April 1 to June 30, and has $6.7 million cash on hand.\n\nCould Amy Klobuchar beat President Trump?\n\nReferring back to INSIDER's recurring poll, Amy Klobuchar overall is believed to be a somewhat weaker candidate in a general election against Donald Trump compared to the whole field.\n\nBased on responses from Democratic primary voters, for a typical candidate surveyed about a third of respondents think they'd win, and another third think they'd lose. Klobuchar comes in a bit low at this early stage: only about 20% think she'd win.\n\nHow is Amy Klobuchar viewed by voters compared to the competition?\n\nINSIDER has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Klobuchar was generally considered to be one of the more right-leaning or centrist candidates in the field, and the most right-leaning of the top tier of candidates to which she is in now.\n\nKlobuchar was among the more experienced candidates in the field by far when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Klobuchar was in the middle of the pack.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Amy Klobuchar's qualifications?\n\nINSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.\n\nFor example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences.\n\nAttributes perceived as most valuable include her released tax returns (+43%), position in the Senate (+40%), middle class upbringing (+36%), Ivy league education (+7%) and past as a lawyer (+3%).\n\nAttributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include her history as a prosecutor (-1%) and corporate lawyer (-33%).\n\nRead more of our stories on Amy Klobuchar:", "description": "Sen.
