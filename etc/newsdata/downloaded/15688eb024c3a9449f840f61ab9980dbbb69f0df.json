I would be on my hands and knees on the floor because I thought I was dying,\" David told Irish Sunday Mirror .\n\n\u201cI was in and out of hospital because my heart rate was over 200 beats per minute at times. I couldn\u2019t sleep because of the fear I wasn\u2019t going to wake the next morning.\n\n\u201cMy doctor prescribed me sleeping tablets at a low dose, but over time the dosage was increased.\n\n\u201cThen I was put on a completely different sleeping pill called Dalmane, which is a benzodiazepine.\n\n\u201cUp until one year ago I had no idea what they were because the doctor never told me anything about them.\n\n\u201cOne of my consultant\u2019s team warned me there may be a risk of dementia in later life if I continued to take it.\n\n\u201cThe minute I heard this I stopped taking them.\u201d\n\nDavid, who is from Cork, Ireland, believes he was lucky he didn\u2019t die due to his withdrawal from the drug.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOn the third night going cold turkey, he woke at 5am unable to breathe. An ambulance was called as he thought he was having a heart attack.\n\nAs a result, David was advised to go back on the tablets.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat I found out was you can\u2019t just stop this medication and I am lucky I didn\u2019t die from sending my body and central nervous system in to shock or from having a seizure.\n\n\u201cThat was in February, 2018.\u201d\n\nDavid stayed on the pills for a further six months, decreasing the dosage on a weekly basis until his body stabilised.\n\nHe has been free from prescription drugs for more than a year, but it hasn\u2019t been without its struggles.\n\nDavid described his time since as a \u201cnightmare\u201d.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019ve awful stomach pain and dizziness and I\u2019m riddled with anxiety.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of feelings like I\u2019m not even in the room and I don\u2019t know who I am seeing when I look in the mirror. It\u2019s a living nightmare. The sleeping pill I was put on should have only been a short-term fix of two weeks not nine years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever resume to the same life I used to live.\u201d\n\nDavid is not alone, according to Dr Pradeep K Chadha, who said dependency on prescription medication is increasing at an alarming rate in Ireland.\n\nAlso known as The Drugless Psychiatrist, Dr Chadha maintains there is an over-emphasis on pharmacological treatment of mental illnesses.\n\nHe added that patients need help with their emotional health in most cases.\n\nHe told the Irish Sunday Mirror: \u201cAll anti-psychotic and psychiatric drugs have some sort of side effects.\n\n\u201cShort-term use of these medications is generally safe and effective. However, long-term use is controversial because of the potential for tolerance, dependence, and other adverse effects.\n\n\u201cBenzodiazepines in general can be quite dangerous. They should not be used long-term for either sleep or anxiety. They should be prescribed for no longer than seven days.\n\n\u201cThey are normally only used as a short-term treatment for severe insomnia, as they can lead to dependence.\u201d\n\nSerious symptoms caused by benzodiazepine withdrawal can include psychosis and seizures.\n\nLeft unmanaged, withdrawal seizures may be progressive, difficult to control, and potentially lethal.\n\nIt is recommended that withdrawal from benzodiazepines should always be done under medical supervision as it can be dangerous \u2013 especially for users with severe dependence and those with pre-existing health issues.", "description": "David Simons, from Cork, Ireland, was first prescribed sleeping pill Stilnoct and then one called Dalmane, which is a benzodiazepine", "authors": ["Emma Mcmenamy", "Brenda Dennehy", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656710.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_David-Simons.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
