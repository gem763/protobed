But enough is enough, the American people deserve better,\u201d he concluded.\n\nBut the specter of impeachment nonetheless overshadowed the proceedings organized by America First Policies, a not-for-profit that seeks to advance the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the event, Pence denied that the partial transcript of a 25 July conversation between Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, amounted to a quid pro quo that $250m of military aid was dependent on Ukraine launching an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe issue of aid and our efforts with regard to Ukraine were, from my experience, in no way connected to the very legitimate concern the American people have about corruption that took place, about things that happened in the 2016 election and \u2026 about the issue that former vice-president Biden had his son on the board of a major energy company in Ukraine at a time that vice-president Biden was running the United States efforts in Ukraine,\u201d he said, repeating a White House line that seeks to shift the focus on to one of the Democratic frontrunners to take on Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nPressed further on the transcript, Pence argued that \u201ca clear reading of the transcript shows that there was no quid pro quo in the president\u2019s call with President Zelenskiy\u201d.\n\nTrump-Ukraine impeachment scandal: timeline of key events Read more\n\nAsked whether the White House would therefore release its own transcripts to back up their claims, Pence said: \u201cI\u2019d have no objection to that, we\u2019re discussing that with White House counsel as we speak.\u201d\n\nIowa plays a key role in the electoral calendar as the first state in the nation to vote in its February caucus, which ensures a steady stream of presidential candidates visit every four years. \u201cIf you run into them at a diner or a street corner, which I know is pretty common around here in Iowa,\u201d Pence joked, \u201ctell the Democrats running for the highest office in the land that Iowa needs the USMCA.\u201d He stated that every Democrat running for president is currently opposed to the USMCA.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s largest producer of corn and pork products and second largest soya bean producer, the USMCA is critically important to Iowa\u2019s economy with Mexico and Canada, accounting for almost half of its exports.\n\nThe Iowa state senator Joni Ernst, who took the stage before Pence, described the USMCA as \u201ca big deal for Iowa\u201d, especially for its dairy farmers and pork producers. \u201cOver 300 days ago President Trump signed this agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me say that again, 300 days ago. I\u2019d say that it\u2019s time for the house to pass USMCA,\u201d she repeated, laying the blame at House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s feet for Congress\u2019s failure to pass the act.\n\nJerry Vanwyk, a corn, bean and cow farmer from Pella, about 50 miles east of Des Moines, admitted that Trump\u2019s trade tariffs had affected his business, but reasoned: \u201cWe gotta do something \u2026 I\u2019m at the stage of life where I can afford to be a long-range thinker and I\u2019m concerned about the future of our country not what\u2019s happening today.\n\n\u201cI just like the way our president is standing up for our country,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s time we quit being walked over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very good thing and I think the Democrats are stalling putting it on the floor,\u201d said Wendi Gibson from Laurel. \u201cNafta was horrible for this country, anything has got to be better than Nafta,\u201d she said, declining to go into specifics.\n\nAttendees at the event believed the impeachment proceedings lack substance. \u201cSo far all the claims against the president have turned out to be useless so I\u2019m just sort of waiting to see what happens,\u201d said Sarah Anderson from Marshalltown.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s garbage,\u201d said Gerald Johnson from Adel. \u201cI think it\u2019s just one of those things that instead of focusing on the issues they\u2019re focusing on things that are easy targets. When you look at everything that\u2019s going on with that it\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to make things up to make them important \u2013 to me, it just doesn\u2019t seem important. It\u2019s a minor thing that happened on the phone call.\u201d\n\n\u201cWitch-hunt!\u201d argued Mark Harvey from Grimes, echoing language Trump has regularly used in his own tweets. \u201cIt will just make them stronger,\u201d he said, referring to the Republican party.\n\n", "description": "Vice-president urged residents to \u2018turn up the heat\u2019 on Democrats to pass USMCA and was pressed on Trump-Zelenskiy transcript", "authors": ["Chris Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de64d1aec99b1bd02c240fd69e1e9d378742c18e/0_68_5435_3262/master/5435.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af96196f64c92c24525d9f15c0d264e3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
