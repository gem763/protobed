In China a public security bureau is a municipal office responsible for law enforcement, fire prevention, traffic control, immigration control and other matters affecting public security.\n\nBeing added to the \"Entity List\" bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from US companies without US government approval.\n\nThe Commerce Department previously added Huawei Technologies and more than 100 affiliates to the Entity List. The Huawei listing hurt many of its US suppliers that depended on the world's largest telecommunications company for revenue and made it difficult for Huawei to sell new products.\n\nHikvision, with a market value of about $US42 billion, calls itself the world's largest video surveillance gear maker. Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30 per cent of its 50 billion yuan ($10.4 billion) in revenue from overseas.\n\nA US Hikvision spokesman said the company \"strongly opposes today's decision by the US government\" and noted in January it retained a human rights expert and former US ambassador to advise the company on human rights compliance.\n\n\"Punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the US government, hurt Hikvision's US businesses partners and negatively impact the US economy,\" the company added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Republican, praised the Commerce announcement. \"The Trump administration is sending a strong, clear message that the United States will hold the Chinese government and Communist Party and their enablers accountable for Beijing's large-scale, systematic and egregious human rights abuses against Uighurs and other religious ethnic minorities in Xinjiang,\" Rubio said.\n\nChina faces growing condemnation from Western capitals and rights groups for setting up facilities that UN experts describe as mass detention centers holding more than 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims.\n\nIn April, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers urged the move against Chinese companies it called \"complicit in human rights abuses\" and specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua.\n\nReuters", "description": "The US Commerce Department placed 28 Chinese public security bureaux and companies on a US trade blacklist over Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1765%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/53e6ff66d2b8990457c810cbd69204ab8fedc027", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
