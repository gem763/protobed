(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday publicly urged China to investigate Democratic challenger Joe Biden, a new request that a foreign government assist his reelection campaign adding to the extraordinary pattern of conduct at the center of a fast-accelerating impeachment inquiry.\n\nWith his brazen and direct appeal to the Chinese, delivered before journalists assembled on the South Lawn of the White House, Trump seemed to make a mockery of the charge that he abused the power of his office by pressing his Ukrainian counterpart to examine unfounded allegations of corruption by Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump\u2019s plea to China for an investigation into the Bidens came almost immediately after he addressed his acrimonious trade war with China. \u201cI have a lot of options on China,\u201d Trump warned, \u201cbut if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter then asked what he had hoped Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would do following their July 25 phone call, Trump replied: \u201cIf they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens. It\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to say, \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks underscored his claim that he did nothing improper by calling on a foreign power to investigate a domestic political opponent, a move his critics consider an egregious violation of his constitutional oath.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement about China effectively globalizes the argument he has been making domestically, calling on other countries to stand with the United States under his rule or against it. It could signal to other countries that one way to curry favor with the United States is by digging up damaging information about Democrats.\n\n[Ukraine, if you\u2019re listening \u2026: How Trump tries to quell controversies by saying the quiet part out loud]\n\nThursday also marked the latest instance of Trump saying aloud something that almost certainly would be a major scandal if revealed from a private conversation. Trump\u2019s request of China echoed his \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening . . .\u201d appeal during the 2016 campaign for the Russian government to steal Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails and release them.\n\n\u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,\u201d Clinton tweeted Thursday.\n\n\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, talks with reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump and his allies have provided no evidence to back up their claims of wrongdoing. Hunter Biden joined the board of an investment advisory firm whose partners included Chinese entities shortly after visiting China in 2013 with his father while he was vice president. George Mesires, an attorney representing Hunter Biden, has said that his client acquired a 10 percent equity stake in the firm in October 2017, and as of this summer that stake was worth about $430,000.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Democratic leaders denounced Trump\u2019s China comments and appeared dumbfounded that the president had given them live ammunition to use against him in their impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere again to help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president\u2019s oath of office,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) told reporters. \u201cIt endangers our elections, it endangers our national security, it ought to be condemned by every member of this body, Democrats and Republicans alike.\u201d\n\nHouse investigators deposed the first major witness in the Ukraine matter, Kurt Volker, who resigned last week as U.S. special envoy for Ukraine after being named in the whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry. Following the nearly 10-hour deposition, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) told reporters that Volker had provided \u201cample evidence\u201d that before Trump would agree to meet with Zelensky, the Ukrainians would have to agree to investigate both the 2016 election to \u201cexonerate Russia\u2019s role\u201d and the Biden family\u2019s involvement with Ukrainian energy giant Burisma.\n\nAlso Thursday came the revelation that Trump ordered the swift removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, this year after hearing concerns from Giuliani, as well as former Texas congressman Pete Sessions, among others, outside of the administration, a senior administration official confirmed. Trump\u2019s role in the ambassador\u2019s ouster was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nGiuliani complained in a recent interview with The Washington Post that Yovanovitch obstructed efforts to persuade the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. \u201cShe is running around the streets of Ukraine going against the elected president of the United States,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\n\n\nFormer U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker arrives on Capitol Hill to be deposed behind closed doors in the House impeachment inquiry on Thursday. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nCongressional Republicans, who rarely speak a cross word about the president, barely blinked at his China remark. The muted response from GOP lawmakers about Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate Biden presented a stark contrast to earlier this week, when many spoke out after the president tweeted congratulations to Chinese President Xi Jinping in celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist rule in Beijing.\n\nBy Thursday, however, most of those voices fell silent on Trump\u2019s latest Chinese assertion. Minutes after Trump called on China to investigate Biden, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tweeted a link to a letter he sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that morning asking her to suspend the impeachment inquiry until she answers questions about the process.\n\nRather than condemning Trump\u2019s appeal to the Chinese, McCarthy prodded the speaker for clarity on whether the House would vote on an official impeachment inquiry, or whether Republicans would get subpoena power to call their own witnesses.\n\n\u201cAs you know, there have been only three prior instances in our nation\u2019s history when the full House has moved to formally investigate whether sufficient grounds exist for the impeachment of a sitting President,\u201d McCarthy wrote. \u201cI should hope that if such an extraordinary step were to be contemplated a fourth time it would be conducted with an eye toward fairness, objectivity and impartiality.\u201d\n\nPelosi responded to McCarthy\u2019s missive by noting that his request came \u201cshortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know, our Founders were specifically intent on ensuring that foreign entities did not undermine the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks to journalists on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.), a deputy whip on Pelosi\u2019s leadership team, said Trump\u2019s comment \u201ccertainly strengthens our case that this president is abusing his power in a way that is really dangerous for America.\u201d He speculated that Trump intentionally was \u201ctrying to say openly and publicly the things he knows he\u2019s going to get caught having said privately to normalize and soften the reaction.\u201d\n\nKildee recalled that during the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation Trump insisted that \u201che would never enlist foreign interference \u2026 \u2018No collusion! No collusion!\u2019 Then he gets caught colluding with Ukraine. I think he\u2019s now decided that the only way he can survive this is to do what he has been doing in secret in a very public way in order to normalize it.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), usually one of the president\u2019s loyal defenders, said in an interview Thursday that he did not agree with the call for China to investigate the Biden family.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go down that road,\u201d Graham said. He tried to explain Trump\u2019s request by adding, \u201cIt\u2019s the president pushing back. He feels like everyone is coming after him all the time and he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nVice President Pence, traveling in Arizona, was a voice of support. Asked about Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate the Bidens, the vice president told reporters, \u201cI think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president in the last administration.\u201d\n\nPence had a different position in 2016 when he was running for vice president. During his debate with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Pence said, \u201cThis is basic stuff. Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump addresses residents of The Villages, a retirement community in Florida, on Thursday. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nTrump, meanwhile, continued his defiant stance Thursday, lashing out at Democrats and the media as he deviated from prepared remarks promoting Medicare, making an official White House event feel like a campaign rally. Addressing residents of The Villages, a retirement community in Florida, Trump mused about staying in office beyond his legal limit of two terms.\n\n\u201cIf you want to drive them crazy, just say eight more years or 12 more years or 16 . . . you\u2019d really drive them into the loony bin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can\u2019t beat us fairly.\u201d\n\nTrump mocked Biden\u2019s standing in the Democratic nominating contest and said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was his likeliest opponent because \u201cshe came up from the ashes.\u201d He called the Democrats \u201cmaniacs\u201d and suggested that if they take back the White House \u201cthe country\u2019s going to go to hell.\u201d\n\nTrump also went on an extended rant about CNN\u2019s coverage of him and then proposed creating a government-run television news network to compete with the independent media.\n\n\u201cWe ought to start our own network and put some real news out there because they are so bad,\u201d Trump said. He added, \u201cWe are looking at that. We should do something about it, to put some really talented people and get a real voice out there, not a voice that\u2019s fake.\u201d\n\nTrump also bizarrely accused pharmaceutical companies of being behind the House Democrats\u2019 push for impeachment because of his administration\u2019s work to lower drug prices.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the hoax didn\u2019t come a little bit from some of the people that we\u2019re taking on,\u201d Trump said, later singling out the pharmaceutical industry. The president provided no evidence for his claim.\n\nAsked to respond, Holly Campbell, a spokeswoman for the industry group PhRMA, said, \u201cNot to be so frank, but it is ridiculous you are asking me about it. Of course we are not.\u201d\n\nJosh Dawsey, Paul Kane, Toluse Olorunnipa and John Wagner contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump\u2019s plea to China for an investigation into the Bidens came almost immediately after he addressed his trade war with China and amid a fast-moving impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/S1PASGAFX7a98FT1QB7XUQeAOMw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NEEFVSHF54I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
