A gunman fired several shots on Wednesday in German city of Halle and at least two got killed, according to local media FOCUS online. The gunman is on the run and police have sealed off the surrounding area. (Sebastian Willnow/dpa via AP)\n\nBy GEIR MOULSON and JENS MEYER\n\nA heavily armed assailant ranting about Jews tried to force his way into a synagogue in Germany on Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest day, then shot two people to death nearby in an attack Wednesday that was livestreamed on a popular gaming site.\n\nThe attacker shot at the door of the synagogue in the eastern city of Halle but did not get in as 70 to 80 people inside were observing the holy day.\n\nThe gunman shouted that Jews were \"the root\" of \"problems\" such as feminism and \"mass immigration,\" according to a group that tracks online extremism. It said a roughly 36-minute video posted online featured the assailant, who spoke a combination of English and German, denying the Holocaust before he shot a woman in the street after failing to enter the synagogue. He then entered a nearby kebab shop and killed another person before fleeing.\n\nGermany's top security official, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, said authorities must assume that it was an anti-Semitic attack, and said prosecutors believe there may be a right-wing extremist motive. He said several people were hurt.\n\nThe attack \"strikes the Jewish community, Jewish people not just in Germany but particularly in Germany, to the core,\" said the country's main Jewish leader, Josef Schuster. \"It was, I think, only lucky circumstances that prevented a bigger massacre.\"\n\nThe filming of Wednesday's attack echoed another horrific shooting halfway around the world when a far-right white supremacist in March killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand and livestreamed much of the attack on Facebook. That massacre drew strong criticism of social media giants for not immediately finding and blocking such a violent video.\n\nWednesday's assault followed attacks in the United States over the past year on synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, California.\n\nThe head of Halle's Jewish community, Max Privorozki, told news magazine Der Spiegel that a surveillance camera at the entrance of the synagogue showed a person trying to break into the building.\n\n\"The assailant shot several times at the door and also threw several Molotov cocktails, firecrackers or grenades to force his way in,\" he said. \"But the door remained closed \u2014 God protected us. The whole thing lasted perhaps five to 10 minutes.\"\n\nA video clip shown on regional public broadcaster MDR showed a man in a helmet and an olive-colored top getting out of a car and firing four shots from behind the vehicle from a long-barreled gun.\n\nConrad Roessler said he was in the kebab shop when a man with a helmet and a military jacket threw something that looked like a grenade, which bounced off the doorframe. He said the man then shot into the shop.\n\n\"All the customers next to me ran, of course I did too. I think there were five or six of us in there,\" Roessler told n-tv television. \"The man behind me probably died.\"\n\n\"I hid in the toilet,\" he added. \"The others looked for the back entrance. I didn't know if there was one. I locked myself quietly in this toilet, and wrote to my family that I love them, and waited for something to happen.\"\n\nPolice then came into the shop, he said.\n\nSchuster offered his condolences to the relatives of \"the two completely uninvolved people\" who were killed and his sympathy to those were wounded. German authorities didn't give any details on the victims.\n\nThe SITE Intelligence Group said the video on livestreaming site Twitch started with the assailant saying \"my name is Anon and I think the Holocaust never happened.\" He mentioned feminism and \"mass immigration\" and said that \"the root of all these problems is the Jew.\"\n\nThe video, which apparently was filmed with a head-mounted camera, showed the perpetrator driving up to the synagogue in a car packed with ammunition and what appeared to be home-made explosives.\n\nHe tried two doors and placed a device at the bottom of a gate, then fired at a woman trying to walk past his parked car. The assailant then fired rounds into the synagogue's door, which didn't open. He drove a short distance to park opposite the kebab shop. He fired at what appeared to be an employee, while customers scrambled away.\n\nTwitch said it was \"shocked and saddened\" by the attack. \"We worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act,\" it said in an emailed response to a query about Wednesday's events. It wasn't immediately able to confirm who streamed the footage.\n\nTwitch, owned by e-commerce giant Amazon, is best known as a site for watching others play video games, sometimes with commentary and tips for viewers. Wednesday's attack appeared to be the first real-world violence livestreamed on Twitch, said Hannah Bloch-Wehba, a law professor at Drexel University. She said it was hard to guess why Twitch was chosen, although she noted that recent attempts by Facebook and Twitter to crack down on such material may be forcing attackers to look for new outlets.\n\nFederal prosecutors, who in Germany handle cases involving suspected terrorism or national security, took over the investigation into the attack in Halle.\n\nAuthorities said shortly after the shooting that a person had been arrested, but advised residents to stay indoors for several hours as they worked to determine whether there were other assailants. They gave no information on the suspect but Der Spiegel and dpa, which cited unidentified security sources, said the suspect is a 27-year-old German citizen from Saxony-Anhalt state, where Halle is located. They identified him only as Stephan B.\n\nSynagogues are often protected by police in Germany and have been for many years amid concerns over far-right and Islamic extremism, but Schuster said that there was no police presence outside the Halle synagogue on Wednesday.\n\n\"I am convinced that if there had been police protection there, in all probability the assailant would not have been able to attack a second site,\" he said.\n\nSecurity was stepped up at synagogues in other cities after the shooting in Halle.\n\nGerman officials rushed to condemn the attack. Chancellor Angela Merkel visited a synagogue in Berlin on Wednesday evening in a show of solidarity.\n\n\"Shots being fired at a synagogue on Yom Kippur, the festival of reconciliation, hits us in the heart,\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter. \"We must all act against anti-Semitism in our country.\"\n\nAnti-Semitism is a top concern in Germany, where reports of anti-Semitic incidents rose 10% last year, according to Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center and where Merkel's government earlier this year reaffirmed its commitment to protecting Jews who wear skullcaps from anti-Semitic threats.\n\nWednesday's attack drew renewed calls from Jewish groups in the U.S. to step up cooperation in combating anti-Semitism. \"We have been saying for several years that anti-Semitism is real, it's resurgent, it's lethal and it's multi-sourced,\" American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris said.\n\nNoting that the attack in Halle comes on the heels of the one-year anniversary of an anti-Semitic shooting that killed 11 worshippers at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue, he said such attacks \"should be triggering alarm bells. The question is whether they are.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
