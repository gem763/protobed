'She is normally so organised. I don't know what to think.

Mother Linda Schultes, 52, (centre) has travelled to Cambodia from Worthing, West Sussex, to help with the search\n\n'There doesn't seem to be any urgency. Her friend is still there as they were due to leave the island on Saturday, but she hasn't left because Amelia is missing.'\n\nAmelia, who saved for the trip for two years by working at Lloyds bank, set off on September 27 and flew first to Vietnam.\n\nKoh Rong, a small island some 130 miles from the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, is popular with backpackers for its crystal waters and sandy coves. Amelia was staying at the Nest Beach Club hostel in the south of the island.\n\nThe manager called the backpacker's mother when she failed to check out. Her passport is still there.\n\nSearchers have questioned why the young woman would have walked away from the beach in the early hours leaving her small Urban Outfitters pack, which was found yesterday on coastal rocks containing her phone and charger, headphones, credit cards, watch, lighter, pen and keyring.\n\nAmelia's 19-year-old sister Georgie, who released the video of her sibling at the party, said: 'We need to be strong and we are trying to be really positive, but it's the unknown. I'm just in shock \u2013 she's never done anything like this before\u2026 she normally messages us every now and then, every time she got wi-fi.'\n\nShe told the BBC: 'She's my best friend.

The Foreign Office is providing support to Amelia's family and officials are remaining in close contact with Cambodian police.\n\nOfficers from Sussex Police are said to have visited the family's home over the weekend to offer support.\n\nSihanoukville provincial Governor Kuoch Chamroeun (center) looks at a map of Koh Rong where British national Amelia Bambridge went missing", "description": "Chhoeun Chantha, commune chief of\u00a0Koh Rong island in Cambodia, where Briton Amelia Bambridge went missing, believes she drowned because her bag was found by the ocean.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance", "Richard Shears In Koh Rong", "Cambodia For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/12/20277448-0-image-a-29_1572264104093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
