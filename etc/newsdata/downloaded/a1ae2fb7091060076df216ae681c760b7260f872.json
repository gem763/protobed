Global stocks tumbled and the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc gained in early Asian trade on Thursday, on signs Washington and Beijing were still wide apart on trade issues and were making no progress in deputy-level talks.\n\nOn one hand, the absence of further news flow on the Modi-Trump trade deal, which extended extreme bullish sentiments in Indian equity markets on September 23rd, 2019; looks to evaporate all gains; besides the evaporation of Sino-U.S. trade deal. While on the other hand, the upcoming summit between India\u2019s Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi and the Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 11-12; to discuss various bilateral, regional and global issues to enhance India-China Closer Development Partnership; which will likely to raise bullish sentiments in Indian equity markets.\n\nNo doubt that evaporating trade deals are likely to extend extreme bearishness in Indian equity markets due to growing uncertainty at a global level due to the growing fear of economic slowdown. I find that steady prices look evident enough to reflect the quantum of growing bearishness in global equity markets.\n\nFinally, I conclude that if and are not able to defend their lowest levels, what they witnessed on October 9th, 2019 before testing their highest level of the day, in today\u2019s trading session; I find that the formation of big \u201cExhaustive Candle\u201d on October 10th, 2019; which will likely to continue selling spree during the upcoming sessions.
