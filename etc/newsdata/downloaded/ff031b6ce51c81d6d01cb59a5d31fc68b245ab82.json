Hong Kong alumni will also continue to receive investment support as usual.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided not to recruit for further cohorts in Hong Kong after January 2020,\u201d EF co-founder Matt Clifford tells me, confirming the news. \u201cThere\u2019s no change to the current cohort and we\u2019ll be running exactly the same program for them as for the previous Hong Kong cohorts. We\u2019ll be in Hong Kong at the end of the month to run our investment process as usual and the companies we back will take part in our Demo Day in January as normal\u201d.\n\nClifford also confirmed that EF had made a handful of early offers to individuals for the next Hong Kong cohort (originally planned for 2020). \u201cWe really rate them all, so we\u2019ve offered to transfer their offer to any other EF site,\u201d he says.\n\nAs for why EF is pulling out of Hong Kong, Clifford says that although there has been three \u201cgood cohorts\u201d in Hong Kong, the talent pool there hasn\u2019t proven big enough to support two cohorts per year \u201cin the long run\u201d. In the first two Hong Kong cohorts, EF has backed around 100 individuals and 11 companies, many of which have gone onto raise external funding.\n\n\u201cThe quality is very high, but we need higher volume to make a site work at scale,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said to our investors that we\u2019ll deploy capital wherever we see the best long term opportunities and, while Hong Kong might well have been viable for another cycle or two, we see more sustainable opportunities elsewhere\u201d.\n\nWhat Clifford doesn\u2019t mention, of course, is the current political unrest in Hong Kong, which continues to see pro-democracy protests and a subsequent police clamp down. This has included lethal force and the use of controversial \u201cemergency powers\u201d by the Hong Kong administration. Clearly any such climate will make it difficult to attract talent to the country, which a program like EF is reliant on.\n\nMeanwhile, Clifford says there\u2019s no change to the scale of EF\u2019s plans, more broadly. The talent investor still plans to back around 1,000 founders globally in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously got the Toronto expansion we announced recently coming up and some other sites in the pipeline, so the total number of individuals and companies we expect to invest in remains the same,\u201d he says.\n\nI also understand that the four full-time permanent members of the Hong Kong team have been offered roles elsewhere at EF, meaning that there are likely no net job losses.", "description": "Entrepreneur First (EF), the Greylock-backed \u201ctalent investor\u201d that recruits and backs individuals pre-team and pre-idea to enable them to found startups, is pulling out of Hong Kong, TechCrunch has learned.
