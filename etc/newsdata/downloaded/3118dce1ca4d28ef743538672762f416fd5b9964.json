It's less business going on. It's less investment. It's more uncertainty. It weighs like a big, dark cloud on the global economy.\"\n\n\"I think trade \u2014 threat against trade at the moment \u2014 is the biggest hurdle for the global economy, yes, indeed,\" she added.\n\nTop trade negotiators from the U.S. and China are set to resume talks next month in Washington.
