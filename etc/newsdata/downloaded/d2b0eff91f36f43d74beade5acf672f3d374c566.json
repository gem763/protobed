A skyscraper on each pod will be equipped with vertical plant farms while livestock and other farming would take place in \u201cplains\u201d surrounding the tower. The company hopes this would produce 100 percent of the food needed by the residents.\n\nAnote Tong pointed his camera phone out to face an eroding shoreline at sunrise. \u201cYou can look out into the beautiful sea,\u201d he said, before turning the camera back closely to his freckled face. \u201cBeautiful, but on the way to be taken.\u201d\n\nStarting in 2003, when he was elected president of the island nation of Kiribati, a series of alarming reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change landed on Tong\u2019s desk. By 2007, they laid out how a slew of climate change\u2013related issues, from coastal erosion to groundwater shortages to increasing dengue fever, could soon force the nation\u2019s 117,000 residents to join the 25 million people displaced by environmental impacts related to climate change every year. \u201cI must admit there was a great deal of denial in the process. My initial reaction was anger, frustration, and a sense of paralysis,\u201d Tong said.\n\nThe problem for the people of Kiribati (pronounced KEE-ree-bas), he said, was that they wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to go. The reports detailed how climate change threatened to literally erase Kiribati\u2019s borders. Sea-level rise meant that within this century, the South Pacific could swallow the 33 islands that make up the nation. Tong would have to develop what he called \u201cradical solutions\u201d to protect the people of Kiribati\u2014building floating islands and underwater cities, and purchasing land from other sovereign nations. \u201cIf we are going to have to relocate,\u201d said Tong, \u201cwe need somewhere to relocate.\u201d\n\nThe science is clear: People who live in coastal cities, like Miami, Sydney, and Shanghai, are already vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Many will have to move internally within the next 80 years to get themselves out of harm\u2019s way, with or without the help of their governments and aid agencies. For citizens of low-lying atolls like those that make up Kiribati, it\u2019s a different story. Climate change isn\u2019t just destroying people\u2019s homes but their homelands, and there soon might not be any nation within which to move internally. Countries in the Pacific with little elevation above the ocean, including Tuvalu and most of the Marshall Islands, all risk becoming uninhabitable for their people by 2030.\n\nThis is the reality for almost 200,000 people of the South Pacific: Their countries might be wiped off the map, and literally no one can agree on what\u2019s to be done about it and them.\n\nIn the past, wars and political conflict have changed states\u2019 borders and shaped power over territories and people. But never before in the history of the world have countries lost sovereign territory permanently because of climate change. Though the question of what happens to the people and territory of states that sink into the ocean has been under discussion since at least the early 90s, there is still no international legal consensus on what can be done for these soon-to-be-stateless people. That has left it up to individual leaders and innovators like Tong to propose radical, sometimes imagination-straining solutions for how to maintain national integrity even when there\u2019s no land on which the nation can stand.\n\nA rendering from Shimizu\u2019s Green Float project.\n\nAs he faced the prospect of his nation literally sinking into the ocean, one extreme solution Tong considered while still in office involved moving the country underwater preemptively. Really.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, the Japanese engineering corporation Shimizu unveiled a design for an underwater glass city called Ocean Spiral that could house as many as 5,000 people. The conceptual metropolis would consist of a spherical city, within which a tower would accommodate homes and work spaces. There would also be a spiral structure connecting this sphere with a base station on the ocean floor, 2.5 miles down\u2014providing the city with essential resources such as energy, freshwater, and food. According to the Shimizu spokesperson Hideo Imamura, however, Ocean Spiral\u2019s technology is still in development.\n\nSince 2008, Shimizu has been working on another project, also noticed by Tong, known as Green Float, which Shimizu promised could be a solution to accommodate people from nations at risk of becoming stateless. The new floating city project would house 10 times as many people as Ocean Spiral and would be designed to withstand natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunamis. An agglomeration of floating islands, each less than two miles wide, forming a lily pad\u2013like colony, Green Float would feature a 300-story-tall \u201ccity in the sky\u201d tower. A section built on the outer edge of the central lily pad would host a beach resort and an ocean forest with a wealth of sea life nearby. Shimizu hopes to finalize a first unit, called Green Float II, by 2030, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. Technological innovations in the coming years could make the project possible through the ability to produce very light metal alloys right at an island\u2019s building site, using magnesium extracted from seawater.\n\nAnd yet, creating permanent floating homes at sea is not an isolated case: It\u2019s been hyped by the Seasteading Institute, which advocates for \u201cseasteads\u201d\u2014politically autonomous human settlements in international waters. According to Duncan Currie, an environmental lawyer and adviser to the High Seas Alliance\u2014a partnership of organizations aimed at conserving the portions of the world\u2019s oceans that exist outside any government jurisdiction\u2014while rising seas may wreak havoc with maritime boundaries, territorially speaking, \u201cthe high seas belong to no one for being beyond national jurisdiction, so when it comes to exploitation, they belong to everyone.\u201d Essentially, building floating nation-states in international waters appears to be legally feasible. It\u2019s a reminder that even Kevin Costner\u2019s Waterworld movie scenario is currently a possibility.\n\nShimizu\u2019s proposed underwater glass city, Ocean Spiral, is designed to draw power and resources to sustain itself from the deep sea.\n\nUp to this point, seasteading has mostly been the interest of a libertarian movement of freedom seekers gearing up to live in permanent dwellings at sea safe from government meddling. But Currie explained that with more than 50 percent of the ocean outside sovereign jurisdiction, it is also an avenue that may be increasingly explored for displaced populations. \u201cThe idea is not to get territory but to establish human habitation, and I think some island states are considering it as a solution,\u201d he said. However, without a new ocean treaty, the legality is still disputed, and things are not quite working out for the lodgers of a two-story octagonal seastead floating off the coast of Thailand who will face the death penalty if they are convicted of violating that country\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, floatable houses or underwater cities are not yet able to provide any long-term solutions for what Alex Randall calls a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in the Pacific. According to Randall, who runs the Climate and Migration Coalition, a network of refugee and migration NGOs, the fact that nobody knows what happens to people from countries that will potentially get wiped off the map in a matter of decades is deeply frustrating: \u201cThe way I look at it is it\u2019s also a really tragic answer, because there are clearly potentially millions of people who will be in that position.\u201d\n\nAs Randall suggested, this is not just a crisis affecting a few dots of land scattered across a vast ocean\u2014it is the future of 800 million people living in hundreds of low-lying coastal cities the world over. In several Pacific countries, villages have already disappeared. Tong recalled the thriving village where he went to school that no longer exists: \u201cThe community has totally relocated. We have a number of those in process. It\u2019s real.\u201d And yet what seemed to worry him equally is the conditions within which his people are forced to relocate. \u201cI\u2019ve always rejected the notion of our people becoming refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I started advocating for a policy of migration with dignity.\u201d\n\nPart of that migration with dignity initiative involved the 2014 government purchase of nearly 6,000 acres of land in Fiji\u2014another island nation, more than 1,300 miles away\u2014to move Kiribati\u2019s residents to. He wanted to develop a well-planned relocation program so that if and when people decided to emigrate, they could do so as people with skills and qualifications, not as \u201csecond-class citizens.\u201d Still, today, the land remains largely uninhabited, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be much political appetite for the move, either in Fiji or in Kiribati. In 2016, Tong was replaced as president by Taneti Mamau, who is known for downplaying the climate crisis and who has halted the migration with dignity project.\n\nAccording to Alan Toth, a journalist who visited the purchased land in 2017, the government of Kiribati had given Fijian farmers permission to cultivate taro and coconut on the plots in the absence of Kirabti\u2019s citizens. Claire Anterea, a former nun and the cofounder of the Kiribati Climate Action Network, said almost no one has moved there, and the purchase has mostly been regarded as an opportunity to safeguard the nation\u2019s food supply, not as a viable option for a new home.\n\nA rendering from Shimizu\u2019s Ocean Spiral project.\n\nA looming issue still to be addressed is the lack of an internationally accepted framework that grants protection to people already forced from their homes. Under current international refugee and human rights law, there is no effective and uniform recognition of climate change as a driving factor of cross-border displacement. This is demonstrated by the lack of a commonly accepted definition of \u201cclimate refugee\u201d and by the absence of legally binding treaties that ensure human rights protection for climate-change-affected people.\n\nKira Vinke of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is developing a proposal for a travel document\u2014or climate passport\u2014that might allow climate displaced people to live and work in countries that are largely responsible for global emissions. Vinke said that the climate passport would allow people to claim an entitlement to relocation rather than be subject to government edicts. As mitigation of climate change becomes less and less feasible, migration is one of the only responses remaining.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to lower the rest of the world\u2019s emissions for years, but now we\u2019re at a point where we can\u2019t just focus on mitigation anymore,\u201d said Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijner, a poet and the United Nations climate envoy for the Marshall Islands. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t see anybody opening their doors anytime soon or welcoming us.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there are limited arrangements between islands that have experienced environmental ruin and powerful countries responsible for the damage. The United States and the Marshall Islands negotiated a Compact of Free Association in the 1980s that entailed U.S. financial aid and extended the right to live and work in the U.S. to the Marshallese, in part as restitution for conducting 67 nuclear tests there. Meanwhile, Australia and New Zealand have made various agreements to take in a few thousand migrants, often for \u201clabor assistance reasons,\u201d from nearby Pacific island countries every year. This extremely limited patchwork of bilateral agreements can\u2019t accommodate the growing number of climate refugees in need of new homes.\n\nA rendering from Shimizu\u2019s Ocean Spiral project.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders know exactly what\u2019s happening to people like us in Kiribati,\u201d said Anterea. \u201cLooking at our neighbor, our big brother Australia, they haven\u2019t taken any major sacrifices to support us.\u201d\n\nTo remain in a sinking country might seem an impossible task, and yet there may be a workable solution, one that Tong called his \u201cfirst preference.\u201d He is referring to the principle of raising islands, either through the elevation of their existing land or building artificial ones in their lagoons by dredging sand and gravel\u2014an option currently under consideration by the Marshall Islands and other Pacific nations.\n\nTong thinks it\u2019s only a short-term possibility for the people of Kiribati, though: \u201cIt may give our homeland another 100 years, but eventually the islands will go.\u201d\n\nChip Fletcher, a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii, has been a strong advocate for island raising nonetheless. Fletcher explained that the Maldives have already taken this approach by dredging material on the island surface and adding vertical elevation an average of two meters high in certain parts, which is what he believes all these atoll nations need to do in order to \u201cstay alive.\u201d\n\nIn spite of the potential need for other more long-term solutions, Jet\u00f1il-Kijner argued that the Marshallese and other neighboring nations are taking responsibility for their own situation and doing what they can with what they\u2019ve been given. The last thing people want to do is move. Jet\u00f1il-Kijner explained how she grew up in the diaspora and knows what it\u2019s like to be separated from land, to be separated from culture. \u201cStaying in our own country is the best option right now and given the climate of immigration rates around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cBuilding and planning for a disappearing island, envisioning a completely new kind of landscape for our people. That\u2019s definitely visionary thinking.\u201d\n\nA rendering from Shimizu\u2019s Ocean Spiral project.\n\nIf you want more border stories, check out this additional package which explores how the borders that divide and surround Europe affect the lives of the people living near them.", "description": "Countries throughout the South Pacific may have their borders erased by rising sea levels within the next 10 years.
