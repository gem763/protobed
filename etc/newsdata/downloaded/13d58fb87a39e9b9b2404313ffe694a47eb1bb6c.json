It comes at the same time as crowds in Iraq, angered for similar reasons as the Lebanese, have been chanting: \u201c Free, free Iraq. Get out corrupt ones \u201d and \u201cIran, get out!\u201d\n\nIran is not a great power. It is a modest power that has played a weak hand well.\n\nAs Walid Joumblatt, the Druze leader, told me over dinner at his Moukhtara mountain fastness, \u201cThe American invasion of Iraq opened the door to the Persian Empire.\u201d\n\nThe Shia-Sunni balance was upset in 2003, within Iraq and across the region, in favor of Shia Iran. The Islamic Republic, like President Vladimir Putin of Russia, is adept at exploiting strategic opportunity on the cheap.\n\nIt pocketed as much of Iraq as newfound Shia dominance would allow, used proxies to shore up Bashar al-Assad in Syria and win the Syrian war, underwrote the Houthis against the Saudis and Emiratis in Yemen, and consolidated Hezbollah\u2019s presence in southern Lebanon as the embodiment of \u201cthe resistance\u201d to Israel.\n\nThat was pretty impressive. But the Islamic Republic, more than four decades after the revolution, resembles the late Soviet Empire \u2014 powerful but hollow, estranged from much of its population, an economic shambles and devoid of answers to the real challenges facing the Middle East today.\n\nIranian overreach is suddenly on the table. The word \u201chostages\u201d is frequently heard in Beirut \u2014 as in hostages of Hezbollah. Why, people ask, should we be that? For a long time, the Israeli threat was sufficient answer. It does not feel that way in Lebanon today.\n\nPowerful reactionary forces, from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, from Egypt to the Islamic Republic, are arrayed against the people of the Middle East who want to free themselves, establish accountable governments, secure the rule of law, live with dignity and enjoy economic opportunity. That has been demonstrated between 2011 and now. Only in Tunisia was the hope of the uprisings fulfilled to a significant degree.", "description": "The Lebanese government falls to a popular uprising as Iran\u2019s role across the Middle East is questioned.", "authors": ["Roger Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/opinion/29cohen-3/29cohen-3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
