The S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% finished slightly weaker, but 1.6% away from a July 26 record close on Monday. Moving even further from record territory was the Nasdaq COMP, -0.04% , though an Apple event coming later could re-energize the tech sector.\n\nOf course when it comes to new highs, it\u2019s worth considering they beget newer highs rather than trigger a selloff. That brings us to our call of the day, from Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley, who says the global economy may be poised for an upside surprise and investors aren\u2019t ready for it.\n\nIn a note to clients that published over the weekend, Sheets explores the possibility that his bank\u2019s \u201cbelow-consensus\u201d view on global growth could be wrong, and better days may be ahead if trade tensions thaw further, China offers more stimulus and global manufacturing woes start to bottom out.\n\nIts admittedly a \"tough one to swallow\" but maybe China leads everything now-a-days? https://t.co/oM7flw1ZBM pic.twitter.com/xcENyK443v \u2014 AndreasStenoLarsen (@AndreasSteno) September 10, 2019\n\n\u201cIn this scenario, yields and inflation expectations would rise meaningfully, as markets assume less easing is needed and better days lie ahead,\u201d he said. As a result, the yield curve would steepen, reflecting expectations for rising inflation and stronger growth. As well, financial stocks would rally, and smaller stocks and those linked to the economic cycle would gain on hopes the global growth engine is stirring to life.\n\nBut Sheets says few investors are even positioned for an early cycle recovery.\n\nSheets says his bank is cautious on global equities and credit. But he describes last week\u2019s stock rally as a \u201cshot across the bow,\u201d adding that \u201cif we\u2019re wrong and growth is set to reaccelerate, the market isn\u2019t positioned for it. The moves could be large.\u201d\n\nWe published our new nowcasting models this morning.
