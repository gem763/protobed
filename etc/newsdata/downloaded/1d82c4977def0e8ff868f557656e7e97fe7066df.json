He\u2019s a little bit older than us. Randy, Rick, and I kept in touch with one another for the years after college. We stayed up on each other\u2019s kids and lives and all that. And Gary\u2019s life kept intersecting with ours. There would be all of these gatherings for our denominational events or humanitarian things we were involved in, and Gary was always present at these things.\n\nOne day we were all sitting around the dining-room table at Randy\u2019s house, saying, \u201cHere we are, adults, well into our careers, and we\u2019re still interested in getting into these big ideas. How do we do this on a more intentional level, so that it isn\u2019t just something that happens whenever we end up in the same vicinity? How do we make this a part of our calendar?\u201d And that\u2019s where what we call \u201cthe Jebus conference\u201d began.\n\nBeck: Why is it called the Jebus conference?\n\nRick Power: Well, the year was 2001. There had been a recent episode of The Simpsons where Homer Simpson made a pledge to public television that he couldn\u2019t pay, so he was rescued by a pastor and sent off to the South Pacific to be a missionary. And, on the way there, he was screaming and crying, \u201cI\u2019m not a missionary. I don\u2019t even believe in Jebus.\u201d But then in the same breath he\u2019s praying, \u201cPlease help me. Save me, Jebus.\u201d\n\nAlso, at that time, there was a very serious scholarly group called the Jesus Seminar. We decided that given the makeup of the four of us, there was no way we could call ourselves anything really serious or sanctimonious. So, instead of Jesus, it became Jebus.\n\nBeck: So how did the Jebus conference come together? Was there something that you felt was missing in your lives that this could fill?\n\nGary Morsch: I really look at life from a very existential point of view\u2014why am I here? I was never interested in success from the standpoint of Western values of assets, money, property, and all of that. Meeting these guys, I felt a kindred spirit.\n\nBefore our group got started, boy, I was asking myself some big questions about life. One of my sayings is, \u201cWhat am I going to be when I grow up?\u201d Even though I\u2019m 68 and these guys are 64 and 65, I will still joke with them, \u201cWhat are you going to be when you grow up?\u201d Because we\u2019re still growing.\n\nRandy Beckum: I\u2019ve been a missionary, I\u2019ve been a pastor, I\u2019ve been a college chaplain. My focus has been on spiritual formation. Doing my theology study in seminary, I had an aversion to getting my beliefs neatly packaged, put in a shoebox under my bed, and then going on with my life. This group has been a lifeline for me to continue to stretch and to rethink. It pushes me, makes me more inclusive, more flexible, and more understanding of people.\n\nBeck: What is the format of the group? I understand that there\u2019s a reading list, and you always travel somewhere together.", "description": "\u201cTo be known completely and to be loved is a very profound experience.
