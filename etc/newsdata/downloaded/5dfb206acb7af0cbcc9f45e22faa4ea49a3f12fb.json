Anthony Brindisi\u2019s first town hall event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.\n\nBut for all the criticism the centrist Democrat faced from pro-Trump voters, the sharper questions came from his own supporters about why he is one of just seven in his caucus who has refused to endorse the impeachment push.\n\n\u201cI know you want me to say I support the inquiry. What I am going to say to you tonight is that I am going to look at all the evidence,\u201d Brindisi said after one woman pressed him for more than five minutes on his stance on impeachment. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can commit to you at this point.\u201d\n\nSwing-district Democrats doggedly avoided the impeachment debate when they first got to Washington. Now they can\u2019t avoid it.\n\nOn the national stage, the party\u2019s posture on impeachment is largely shaped by cable news fixtures like House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff or members of leadership like Pelosi.\n\n\n\nBut at dozens of town halls over the two-week recess, Brindisi and other vulnerable freshmen had to fend for themselves \u2014 serving as the party\u2019s on-the-ground voices on impeachment.\n\nWhether they can deliver a message that resonates could determine Democrats\u2019 chances of winning over the public and holding on to their seats and the House majority in 2020.\n\nEach town hall comes with high stakes and uncertain scenarios \u2014 pro-Trump protests or booming cheers for impeachment \u2014 and each time, lawmakers are forced to go beyond their leadership\u2019s talking points on the fast-moving scandal consuming the White House.\n\nPOLITICO has zeroed in on three House Democrats whose different approaches to impeachment underscore the tensions the party faces.\n\n\n\nThe hold-out\n\nOutside the New Hartford high school, a group of pro-Trump picketers stood on the manicured lawn shouting \u201cHonk for Trump!\u201d at every car that passed \u2014 at times, getting into shouting matches with drivers who didn\u2019t share their politics.\n\nBrindisi's district went for Trump by more than 15 points in 2016, but inside the packed auditorium, the audience skewed more liberal. There were deafening bursts of applause when Brindisi talked up climate change bills, tighter gun control and a \"more humane\" border policy.\n\nBut there were also cheers when he spoke about telling off his more progressive colleagues on \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d voting against Pelosi\u2019s speakership on the floor and his commitment to working with Trump \u2014 showcasing the kind of independent streak that Brindisi's supporters hope will keep him in Congress.\n\nBrindisi has frustrated some liberals inside and outside Washington for withholding his support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump, though he said he is disturbed by allegations that the president had pressured Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden, a potential 2020 opponent.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk to me about President Trump, I always said... if he\u2019s doing things that help the state, help the community, help the country, I\u2019ll be the first one to support him,\u201d Brindisi said.\n\nRep. Anthony Brindisi. More\n\n\u201cBut if he\u2019s doing things that I think are going to harm this country \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Barack Obama, if he\u2019s doing something that\u2019s going to hurt the country, I\u2019m going to stand up,\u201d Brindisi said, prompting a roar of applause.", "description": "The \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats were in the front row Thursday night at freshman Rep.
