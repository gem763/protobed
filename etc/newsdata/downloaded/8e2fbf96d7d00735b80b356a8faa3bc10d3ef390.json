But guess what.\n\nThey did that back in July. And it failed.\n\nA resolution to impeach the president brought by Rep. Al Green from Texas went down in flames, 332-95.\n\nSo now Democrats have taken to Plan B and kicked off the alarming sounding \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d \u2014 meaning, they\u2019re looking for a pathway toward impeachment.\n\nMeaning, they don\u2019t have the goods to impeach just yet. So they\u2019re going on a search.\n\nMeaning, Trump\u2019s quite right to tweet: \u201cThey (Dems) are scrambling for a theme and narrative. They\u2019ve gone everywhere from Russian Hoax to Russian Collusion \u2026 and now they\u2019ve come to this \u2026 they think they should have won the 2016 election, they think in their bizarre brains that they did \u2026\u201d\n\nThis attempt to impeach, which comes by way of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s directive to six Democrat-led committees to gather evidence and give it to Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler \u2014 who will help decide whether or not to go forward with formal impeachment proceedings \u2014 is about Trump\u2019s telephone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nBut just hours after announcing the inquiry, Democrats were already put on the defensive.\n\nTrump not only vowed to release the transcript of his call, a la \u201cnothing to see here, go home, folks\u201d attitude. But he\u2019s also pivoted the negatives into positives.\n\nImpeachment, he said, in the aftermath of Pelosi\u2019s announced inquiry, is \u201ca positive for me.\u201d And as he pointed out: How can you impeach when \u201cyou haven\u2019t even seen the phone call\u201d transcripts, yet?\n\nThat is the question.\n\nHow can an impeachment go forth absent any impeachable offense?\n\nThat\u2019s a question the Democrats have been struggling to address since Trump, Day One. They\u2019ve yet to come up with a suitable solution.\n\nThey\u2019ve yet to go forward with an impeachment call that doesn\u2019t put the cart before the horse.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
