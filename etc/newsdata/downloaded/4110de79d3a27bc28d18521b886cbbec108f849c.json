REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo\n\nWeWork\u2019s parent The We Company on Monday filed to withdraw its initial public offering, a week after the SoftBank-backed startup ousted founder Adam Neumann as its chief executive officer and as its potential IPO valuation dropped as low as $10 billion, from $47 billion in January.\n\nThe consensus among venture capital investors at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference and elsewhere was that unlimited power and money were not good for building companies. Some of the problems were blamed on Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), a backer of WeWork that has become one of the most powerful tech investors globally. SoftBank declined to comment on the criticism.\n\n\u201cIf a founder is not being responsible - and you know we are fiduciaries at the end of the day to all common shareholders, including employees - we have to do the right thing,\u201d said Neeraj Agrawal, General Partner of Battery Ventures.\n\nHe spoke during a TechCrunch session and later told Reuters that founders\u2019 power has grown as money has poured into the tech world.\n\nWhile interest rates remain low, don\u2019t expect the flow of money to stop, said David Golden, managing partner at Revolution Ventures. He noted that big checks from investors could inflate values, making it more difficult to raise funds later - another issue highlighted by WeWork\u2019s recent valuation struggles.\n\nBig SoftBank investments sometimes unnerve investors, Golden said. \u201cWe call the other early stage investors and say, \u2018Hey, congratulations, you just got a great markup in that deal. You look really smart.\u2019 And to a fault they would say, \u2018We\u2019re screwed because no one\u2019s going to buy this company now the price has been set too high.\u2019\u201d\n\nNed Desmond, the Chief Operating Officer of tech media, data, and events company TechCrunch said competition among big name venture capitalists was fiercer than ever to get into some of the early-stage companies at the conference.\n\nAnd at the conference, the general mood among the startups was upbeat. Garry Drummond, the CEO of 802 Secure, who was showing off his cyber security hardware on the floor, said he was raising up to $8 million in a series A round and that the WeWork debacle was not having any impact.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s saying no to us,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the wealth of funding has a third problem, also seen in WeWork, of undermining spending discipline.\n\n\u201cWithout that capital you are forced to be a little more disciplined on where you get bang for the buck,\u201d said Sameet Mehta Managing Partner at Granite Hill Capital Partners.\n\nWe Company, in fact, is slashing spending and divesting secondary businesses as it tries to win back investors\u2019 confidence following its botched attempt to go public.\n\n\u201cI wish they weren\u2019t writing quite such big checks,\u201d said Megan Quinn General Partner of Spark Capital about SoftBank during a session at TechCrunch. \u201cIt does feel like a lot of companies have raised more capital than they really know what to do with responsibly.\u201d", "description": "The implosion of office space company WeWork this week is being digested as a lesson for Silicon Valley startups - in what not to do.", "authors": ["Jane Lanhee Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436808140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921UX"}
