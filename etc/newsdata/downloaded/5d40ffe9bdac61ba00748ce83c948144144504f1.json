I want to help people.\n\n\"Those horrific things I saw when I was growing up... nothing can shock me now, and I want to use that mental toughness working as a social worker.\n\n\"And when people say, 'Oh, you're that cyclist', I'll say, 'No, that was a few years ago. I'm a social worker now'.\"\n\nWiggins' reputation has suffered some damage since his retirement.\n\nThe Fancy Bears hackers revealed details of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) Wiggins was granted ahead of some of his biggest races, including the 2012 Tour, while an investigation into the contents of a jiffy bag delivered to the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine for his use was inconclusive.\n\nWiggins called the investigation a \"malicious witch-hunt\" at the time.\n\nThe interview in the Big Issue will appear just a few days after it was announced that Team Wiggins Le Col, the professional development team Wiggins formed in 2015, will close its doors at the end of the season, having helped a number of young British riders reach the WorldTour.\n\nWiggins was the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2012, with his Tour success helping transform the popularity of cycling and his pose on a throne in front of Hampton Court Palace after his Olympic gold becoming one of the defining images of the London Games - as were his late-night celebrations.\n\nBut Wiggins is clear that is now all behind him.\n\n\"It's nice to be remembered but I can't keep waltzing in with a rock'n'roll haircut and a suede suit on, drunk,\" he said. \"I've moved on from that person. Everything ends, everything has to end.\"", "description": "Sir Bradley Wiggins has revealed he is taking a degree in social work as he looks to redefine himself after his cycling career.
