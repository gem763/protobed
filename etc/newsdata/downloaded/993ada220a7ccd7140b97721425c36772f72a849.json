Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., after she accused him and President Trump of following a \u201cwhite supremacist ideology\u201d by allegedly trying to block non-Caucasian migrants from entering the U.S.\n\n\u201cMy constituents, Americans across this country aren\u2019t fooled by this administration\u2019s specious attempts to distinguish between documented and undocumented immigration,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told Cuccinelli at a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on the treatment of migrants.\n\nKEN CUCCINELLI FLOATED AS LIKELY NEXT DHS CHIEF WITH MCALEENAN TO STEP DOWN\n\n\u201cYou and Mr. Trump don't want anyone who looks or talks differently than Caucasian Americans to be allowed into this country,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s false,\u201d Cuccinelli shot back. He was then interrupted by the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, who told him not to interrupt her, but he carried on: \u201cThat\u2019s defamatory.\"\n\n\u201cExcuse me, there\u2019s nothing defamatory about it,\u201d she said.\n\nWasserman Schultz wasn\u2019t done: \u201cYou want to block all immigration and make life harder for immigrants and you have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs, even if it means making critically ill children your collateral damage in the process.\"\n\nThe hearing was held to discuss the administration's decision this summer to suspend a program that delayed deportations of some illegal immigrants who were seeking emergency medical treatment. The administration resumed the program in September after a backlash from Democrats and activists.\n\nWasserman Schultz also made a reference to the administration's public charge rule -- which restricts green cards to immigrants who are deemed likely to be reliant on welfare -- and asked how many children would be affected by the rule.\n\nCUCCINELLI PUTS HARDLINE STAMP ON IMMIGRATION AGENDA, JUST 2 MONTHS INTO USCIS JOB\n\nBut Cuccinelli wanted to respond to her claim that he was pursuing a white supremacist ideology.\n\n\u201cAfter declaring that I am not a white supremacist, as you alluded, nor is the president ... \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFacts matter,\u201d Wasserman Schultz responded.\n\n\u201cYes they do, truth matters,\u201d Cuccinelli said\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen Wasserman Schultz said that was \u201cwhy I am stating them here today,\u201d Cuccinelli disagreed again.\n\n\u201cNo you certainly are not, you are certainly cloaked in legislative privilege, which means you can get away with not telling the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nCuccinelli is being closely watched as a possible successor to outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan. McAleenan's last day on the job is Thursday and an announcement of a successor is expected imminently.\n\nIt isn't Wasserman Schultz's first fight with a Trump immigration official. In a hearing last month, she accused former Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Thomas Homan of giving \"jingoistic, bigoted testimony.\"", "description": "Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Ken Cuccinelli clashed Wednesday with Rep.
