Bush who proposed swapping the trader for an American pastor in Turkish custody, according to two people familiar with the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe president says, \u2018Guys, give Rex your pitch,\u2019 \u201d according to one of the people.\n\nTillerson was so unsettled by the extraordinary request to intervene in an ongoing criminal investigation that he complained to then-Chief of Staff John F. Kelly that he believed it was inappropriate, according to a former administration official. Kelly told him to disregard it, the official said.\n\nAD\n\nBloomberg News first reported Trump\u2019s request to Tillerson. The Washington Post obtained new details about the extent of the lobbying effort to kill the case \u2014 including the presence of Zarrab\u2019s attorneys in the Oval Office and a visit Giuliani made to the Justice Department around the same time to ask for the case to be dropped.\n\nAD\n\nThe revelation of the 2017 episode comes as Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into allegations that he used his office to seek ammunition against a political rival from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn both cases, Trump bypassed standard government procedures and turned to Giuliani \u2014 a private lawyer with separate interests \u2014 to take part in discussions about U.S. policy. At the time of the Tillerson meeting, Giuliani was one of the president\u2019s staunchest political allies, someone who Trump later tapped in April 2018 to personally represent him.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview, Giuliani confirmed he sought a prisoner exchange but declined to comment on any private discussions on the topic.\n\n\u201cThere was no such meeting where Tillerson got angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no such meeting as the one you described.\u201d\n\nAsked about his meetings with Trump and other officials about Zarrab, he declined to answer. \u201cYou\u2019re not my prosecutor,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nKelly, Tillerson and Mukasey declined to comment. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn rare cases, U.S. criminal prosecutions have been halted or altered to achieve to an overriding diplomatic goal, but such decisions are usually rigorously studied by the State and Justice departments, with extensive consultation with the prosecuting U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nAD\n\nPreet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney in New York whose office launched the investigation of Zarrab, said Trump\u2019s efforts to intervene in the case did not appear to follow that protocol.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just another example of the president trying to meddle in specific law enforcement actions, whether to help an ally or harm a rival,\u201d said Bharara, a Trump critic. \u201cThis incident, like the incidents involving Ukraine and China and others, should be looked at very carefully.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nErdogan had repeatedly lobbied Trump to release Zarrab, both in personal meetings and calls in the spring and summer of 2017, according to multiple administration officials and Erdogan himself. The Turkish president claimed publicly that Zarrab, charged in a conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran, was a political \u201chostage\u201d of American law enforcement.\n\nAD\n\nErdogan met with Trump in a formal visit at the White House on May 16, 2017. Trump told associates that Erdogan raised several issues with him, including Erdogan\u2019s request that he release Zarrab to Turkey, according to two former administration officials.\n\nThe trader held embarrassing and politically damaging information about Erdogan and other top Turkish officials in his government, it was later revealed in federal court.\n\nIn late 2017, Zarrab pleaded guilty to orchestrating a multibillion-dollar conspiracy to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran by disguising money transfers so they would appear to be legitimate gold trades. He testified in federal court that the scheme was approved by Erdogan. Turkish officials denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani and Mukasey, also a former chief judge in the Southern District of New York, had joined Zarrab\u2019s defense team in March 2017 and flew to Turkey late February to meet with Erdogan to discuss a possible \u201cstate-to-state resolution in this case,\u201d according to court filings in the Zarrab case. Mukasey told then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions before the trip, and Giuliani told Bharara, records indicate.\n\nTheir visit with Erdogan was viewed with deep suspicion by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, who asked the presiding federal judge to examine the lawyers\u2019 role in the case.\n\nIn an affidavit unsealed in May 2017, Giuliani said his role was to help determine \u201cwhether this case can be resolved as part of some agreement between the United States and Turkey that will promote the national-security interests of the United States and redound to the benefit of Mr. Zarrab.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBehind the scenes, Giuliani was pressing U.S. officials for assistance.\n\n\u201cGiuliani was lobbying anyone he could find in the government to get his guy out,\u201d according to a person with knowledge of his role.\n\nGiuliani secured a 2017 meeting with Brian Hook, a senior State Department official, in a bid to help his Turkish client, a former senior administration official said. But Hook was skeptical, this official said.\n\nWhen Tillerson arrived for a routine meeting with Trump at the White House in the fall of 2017, he found Giuliani and Mukasey already sitting in the Oval Office, according to two people familiar with the episode.\n\nThe lawyers suggested that Tillerson could help craft a deal to swap Zarrab for American pastor Andrew Brunson, who was detained in 2016 after a coup attempt in Turkey. (Brunson was ultimately freed in October 2018.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTillerson balked, noting that Zarrab was the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation, according to one person.\n\nMukasey argued Tillerson had broad authority, saying effectively that he could do whatever he wanted.\n\nAfter the meeting, Giuliani called Tillerson to try to follow up, but the then-secretary of state rebuffed him, according to the person familiar with Tillerson\u2019s account.\n\nWhite House officials, particularly Kelly, were dismayed by Giuliani\u2019s conversations with Trump, who did not seem to understand that he should not interfere in a criminal investigation, according to people with familiar with the conversations.\n\nSometime in mid- to late 2017, Giuliani showed up at the Justice Department and requested a meeting with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein about the Zarrab case, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of the people said that when Giuliani, who did not have an appointment, called to say he was coming by, he said he was coming from the White House.\n\nAD\n\nHis request to meet with Rosenstein was denied, the people said, though they said it was possible Giuliani then met with lower-level officials. The department, the people said, was not particularly receptive to Giuliani\u2019s advocacy that the case be dropped.\n\nTwo former Justice Department officials said they were unaware of any direct pressure from the White House about the case \u2014 though they conceded it was possible conversations had taken place without their knowledge.\n\nTrump was hardly shy about pressuring Sessions and other officials on law enforcement matters. In early summer of 2017, Trump called the then-attorney general at home and asked him to reverse his recusal from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, according to the special counsel report.\n\nBy later in 2017, however, the relationship between Trump and Sessions was almost completely fractured. Former Justice Department officials said the longer Sessions stayed in his position, the less frequently he talked with the president.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sessions declined to comment.", "description": "At the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was personally lobbying the president to get the charges dropped.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Carol D.
