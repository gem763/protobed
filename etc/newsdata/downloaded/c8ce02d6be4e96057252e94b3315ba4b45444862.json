(Photo: Tim Stahmer, Flickr)\n\nScientists have discovered a phenomenon that looks a whole lot like a dark matter particle in a laboratory system, according to new research.\n\nAxions are a yet-to-be-observed fundamental particle that are predicted to exist by physics theory. They\u2019re a potential explanation as to what\u2019s causing the mysterious cosmic anomalies attributed to dark matter. But physicists have recently realised that axion-like behaviour could show up from the collective action of particles in crystals. Scientists in Germany, the United States, and China have now observed that behaviour.\n\n\u201cWe show that axions exist at all \u2014 the mathematical concept does apply to some part of nature,\u201d Johannes Gooth, the study\u2019s first author from the Max Planck Institute for the Chemical Physics of Solids, told Gizmodo.\n\nThis Theory Could Breathe New Life Into The Hunt For Dark Matter Physicists don\u2019t know where most of the universe\u2019s apparent mass has gone, and attempts to find it have so far failed. But a proposed particle born out of the universe\u2019s chaotic first moments may provide a candidate and a reasonable way to look for it.

Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons, which are in turn made of up subatomic particles called quarks. Quarks have an antiparticle partner, which has the same mass but opposite electrical charge. The physical rules that govern quarks work the same as they do for antiquarks if you switch \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright,\u201d as in a mirror \u2014 but there\u2019s no reason why they should.\n\nScientists Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn devised a new kind of physical field that explains why quark physics would maintain this symmetry. The field comes with a corresponding particle, called the axion. Axions would barely interact with regular matter and are therefore a potential candidate for dark matter, a mysterious mass that seems to have large-scale effects throughout the universe but no known identity.\n\nThe axion that appears in this new research is not a fundamental particle but instead is an analogue, based on the collective behaviour of lots of particles in a material called a Weyl semimetal. The collective behaviour looks similar in the material to the way a fundamental axion should look in free space. Scientists observed it based on the strange way the material responded to high electric and magnetic fields, according to the paper published in Nature.\n\nA Weyl semimetal is a strange material. The collective behaviour of its protons and electrons make it seem as if, instead of containing electrons with mass, it has massless, right- and left-handed electrical charges moving around inside it, called Weyl fermions. It\u2019s kind of like the way we treat ocean waves as individual units with their own height and speed, even though we know they\u2019re actually just disturbances in the water. The Weyl fermions form a lattice of electric charge, through which the researchers observed electric disturbances travelling. These disturbances, a collective behaviour of collective behaviours \u2014 like an ocean wave made of more ocean waves \u2014 were the system\u2019s axions.\n\nAgain, researchers haven\u2019t discovered \u201creal\u201d axions but axion-like disturbances that appear in a highly engineered system. Perhaps they can use this discovery to provide constraints as to what an axion in the vacuum of space might look like.\n\nThis experiment falls into a category we cover a lot: Things that are difficult or impossible to understand in space, like the Big Bang or black holes or the specifics of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, become comprehensible in highly engineered analogs in laboratories. Weyl semimetals have proven to be an especially good system for creating these analogs.\n\nDoes this mean that we\u2019re closer to finding dark matter? Probably not. But the work at least suggests that axions could be real.", "description": "Scientists have discovered a phenomenon that looks a whole lot like a dark matter particle in a laboratory system, according to new research....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ulldq0yvhrtxqfb47htd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
