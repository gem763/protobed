In the Netherlands, oxycodone prescriptions doubled in only three years, while opioid prescriptions in the U.K. spiked by 127 percent between 1998 and 2016.\n\nEurope certainly has an issue with opioids \u2014 the No. 1 drug-related killer on the Continent. They were involved in more than 80 percent of the 8,200 drug-related deaths recorded in 2017. But the situation is playing out differently than the one in the U.S., which recorded around 70,000 opioid-related deaths in 2017, and where the epidemic has claimed almost 400,000 lives in the past two decades.\n\nBart Morlion, president of the European Pain Federation (EFIC), says the far tighter regulation of opioid prescriptions in Europe plays a big role, including in the stricter controls over how drug companies advertise to patients and doctors. And in many European countries, especially in the south, people are more wary of painkillers.\n\nEurope's environment \"is completely different from the U.S.,\" Morlion told POLITICO.\n\n\"We are prepared if the tsunami comes to Europe in the next years\" \u2014 SED President Juan Antonio Mic\u00f3\n\nSpain is a good case in point. The country saw opioid consumption increase by nearly 84 percent between 2008 and 2015. But people aren't flocking to emergency rooms or dying from overdoses due to their opioid prescriptions.\n\nSome doctors are nonetheless ringing alarm bells that the country \u2014 and Europe \u2014 cannot be complacent.\n\n\u201cThere are these differences that make us more protective than in the U.S.,\" said Aina Perell\u00f3 Bratescu, a family doctor in Catalonia who studies opioid prescriptions in the region. \"But it's not good to feel like there's no danger and everything is OK.\"\n\nOf particular concern is Spain's spike in prescriptions for rapid release fentanyl, which doubled from 2010 to 2016. These drugs \u2014 often administered by a nasal spray or chewing tablets \u2014 are 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine. This worrying trend prompted the Spanish health ministry to update its prescription guidelines and convene a working group to discuss the issue.\n\n'This is another country'\n\n\n\nExperts in Spain are quick to point out how different the environment is from the U.S.\n\nV\u00edctor Mayoral, the secretary of the Spanish Society of Pain (SED) and a pain doctor in Catalonia, said practices like doctor-shopping \u2014 going from doctor to doctor to get more prescriptions \u2014 simply aren't possible in Spain thanks to the national rollout of electronic prescriptions five years ago.\n\nAnother big difference, according to Mayoral, is that the country is constantly on alert for prescription abuse. For example, on the local level in Catalonia, when someone is prescribed a \"high dose\" of an opioid (more than 90 milligrams of morphine, for example) he and the regional department of health pharmacists investigate the prescription, sometimes literally meeting at his house to discuss whether the prescription for a patient is accurate.\n\nSpain has also taken steps to avoid conflict-of-interest problems that have drawn attention in the U.S. For example, Spain forbids pharma reps from taking doctors out for meals more than \u20ac60.\n\nIn addition, Spain adheres to an EU law that says pharma companies cannot provide doctors with drug samples.\n\nMeanwhile, advertising standards vary greatly between the two continents. Pharma companies can advertise for aspirin and paracetamol in Spain. But opioids?\n\n\"The problem is that each time you feel the effect less. You need more doses, and more frequently\" \u2014 Flora, an arthritis sufferer\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Mayoral said.\n\nAnd the doctors insist these measures are shoring up the country against a U.S.-style opioid epidemic.\n\n\"We are prepared if the tsunami comes to Europe in the next years,\" said SED President Juan Antonio Mic\u00f3, talking on the sidelines of a recent event in Valencia. \"But at this present moment, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible in Europe.\"\n\n'A ticking time bomb'\n\n\n\nSome patients disagree.\n\n\"I think it is only a matter of time ... that the problem of opioids in Spain is unleashed so much that it is impossible to silence it much more,\" said one patient, Flora, age 44.\n\nFlora has degenerative arthritis. After other pain relievers became ineffective, her doctors had her try opioids. She started with moderate ones like tramadol, but once that stopped working, her general practitioner, in coordination with her neurosurgeon, moved her on to more intense opioids.\n\nQuickly, those became less and less effective. \"The problem is that each time you feel the effect less,\" she said. \"You need more doses, and more frequently.\"\n\nAt some point, she was faced with a hard choice: She could either decrease her pain, or move her finger.\n\nFlora was becoming increasingly tolerant to the fentanyl patches she was taking, and if she wanted to stop feeling pain, she would need more. More fentanyl, though, would leave her physically unable to move.\n\nThis is when she knew she was dependent.\n\n\"I couldn't go without them, but when I took them I couldn't do anything at all,\" said Flora, who used a different name for this article.\n\nPerell\u00f3, the doctor, said it's sometimes difficult to tell whether opioids such as fentanyl patches are \"over-prescribed.\" When there's a patient in serious pain, how does a doctor choose the right balance between relieving a patient's pain and creating an addict?\n\nRapid release fentanyl, though, is easier to judge because it's supposed to be used only for cancer patients, she said. In a 2018 regional study of 43,000 patients given strong opioids in Catalonia, the Catalan Health Service found 43 percent of the rapid release fentanyl prescriptions were for non-oncological pain. Another 20 percent were given high doses of opioids.\n\nWhen asked about these numbers, a spokesperson for Spain\u2019s pharma association Farmaindustria responded that companies can only promote medicines like rapid release fentanyl for their indicated use \u2014 in other words, they're staying within their legal guidelines.\n\n\"When the pain comes so strong it relaxes me and takes away the pain, but at what price?\" \u2014 Hasan, patient on pain medication\n\nBut these numbers, Perell\u00f3 said, are still worrying.\n\n\u201cWe are giving it to them like there is no danger,\" she said.\n\nMostly commonly, Perell\u00f3 said, she sees older women with chronic pain given fentanyl patches. It might help address their pain, but they are also left unable to move in their apartments.\n\nPerell\u00f3 said she also sees younger people who are prescribed the drugs over a long period of time \u2014 and the doctors are \"making addicts.\"\n\n56-year-old Hasan is one of them. He was injured in an accident as a construction worker at the age of 32, and began with a host of pain relievers to tackle the pain. Then, 12 years ago, he went to a pain clinic and was prescribed a high dose of fentanyl.\n\nThat kind of dosage is \"for terminal cancer patients who will die, which is not my case,\" Hasan said. The drugs made him feel \"doped all day.\"\n\nHasan's general practitioner realized he was a \"ticking time bomb,\" but couldn't take Hasan off high potency opioids right away.\n\nHasan has whittled down his dose of Actiq \u2014 a fentanyl drug taken like a lollipop. Years of the drugs have worn away the roof of his mouth. He is still trying to decrease his intake.\n\nThe increase in prescription rates do worry those in Europe.\n\n\"When the pain comes so strong it relaxes me and takes away the pain,\" Hasan said, \"but at what price?\"\n\nLessons across Europe\n\n\n\nEurope's approach to controlling legal prescriptions stands in contrast to the U.S. There, the \"first wave\" of the opioid epidemic began when people became addicted to legal prescription opioids like oxycodone, morphine and fentanyl. When patients built up a tolerance to the drugs, they were able to go doctor shopping to get more prescriptions and feed a growing addiction.\n\nPeople then turned to the black market for illicit opioids like heroin or the many forms of synthetic fentanyl that made up the second and third waves of the opioid epidemic in the States.\n\nBy contrast, Fernando Ribas de Pina, an intervention specialist at the drug rehabilitation group Proyecto Hombre in Valencia, said he has not had a single person enter his center with an addiction to prescription opioids. Rather, typical addiction issues have more to do with alcohol and cocaine.\n\nThe increase in prescription rates do worry those in Europe.\n\n\"We are concerned because to the extent there is more fentanyl moving through society, the possibility of abusing it, of improper use, obviously increases,\" Ribas de Pina said, with printed news articles about the U.S. opioid epidemic laid out on a conference table in front of him.\n\n\u201cI think this analysis must be done in every single country\u201d \u2014 Bart Morlion, president of the European Pain Federation\n\nBut by comparison, he said, there is \"no significant sample\" of that kind of illicit opioid abuse in the country.\n\nNeither Flora or Hasan, for example, said they have ever turned to the black market to purchase illegal opioids.\n\nStill, it's also clear that Europe lacks a complete picture of the problem, as there isn't any standardized data examining prescription opioids \u2014 and their abuse \u2014 around Europe. And it seems that in some countries, illicit opioid abuse is a bigger cause for concern. Estonia, for example, has a much longer history of opioid abuse, but most of this appears to be with synthetic fentanyl.\n\n\n\nEFIC's Morlion points to specific measures his native Belgium has taken that he thinks should be adopted across the bloc. For example, the Belgian health ministry did an analysis to see which doctors were prescribing opioids too much.\n\n\u201cI think this analysis must be done in every single country,\u201d EFIC's Morlion said.\n\nBut individual doctors need to be aware of the risks prescribing opioids, Perell\u00f3 warned: \"We are more calm than we should be.\"\n\nArnau Busquets Gu\u00e0rdia contributed reporting.\n\nUPDATE: This version includes a response from Farmaindustria and clarifies that the survey on fentanyl prescriptions was conducted by the Catalan Health Service.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Health Care.
