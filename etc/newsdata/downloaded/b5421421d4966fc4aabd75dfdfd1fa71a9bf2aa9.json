They like to snack on cookies and cheese puffs and suck down sugary smoothies. Hey, who doesn\u2019t? But toddler snacks are marketed in a way that makes parents think they\u2019re buying something extra wholesome and healthy.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: Annie\u2019s organic bunnies are candy. These organic \u201cbreakfast biscuits\u201d with Elmo\u2019s face on the box are cookies. Gerber Lil\u2019 Crunchies, cheddar flavour, are straight-up cheese doodles.\n\nI\u2019ve got three kids, so I fully understand why these products exist. You are busy, and your kid probably has weird opinions about food (if not in general, then definitely when they\u2019re out and about and prone to getting hangry). When your first baby starts eating food, you\u2019re like what the heck should I feed him now? Pureed baby food is a natural first step, and then every other shelf in that part of the store beckons: feed him this, too.\n\nEverything in this aisle is convenient, but it\u2019s pretty much all overpriced and unnecessary. There are toddler \u201cdinners\u201d that are just regular food, but cut up into little pieces. The aforementioned cookies and cheese puffs. Pouches, which are basically smoothies. And toddler milks, which are sold as the next thing your kid should drink after they outgrow formula. (Your paediatrician will tell you: once your child turns 1, you can switch straight to regular milk.)\n\nBut to walk past all of those items, you have to realise a few things. Organic does not mean healthier. Green and brown packaging does not mean healthier. Baby-specific packaging does not make a food more suitable for a baby than the same thing in another aisle. Many of the snack foods illustrated with photos of fruits and vegetables contain only a tiny bit of those fruits or vegetables, just enough to make them look special. As the Washington Post reports, parents are left thinking the foods in this aisle are healthier than adult snack foods, but they\u2019re usually not.\n\nI mean, I get it. I didn\u2019t buy yogurt puffs for my kids, so they ended up bumming them off other kids\u2019 mums. They taste pretty good! But if I\u2019m going to buy sugary snack foods, I might as well save my money and go buy them from the grownup aisles.", "description": "Toddlers: they\u2019re just like us.
