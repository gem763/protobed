(Getty)\n\nDeAndre Hopkins skipped practice over late Houston Texans owner Bob McNair\u2019s 2017 comment likening NFL players to inmates.\n\nIn a GQ interview published on Tuesday, the Texans wide receiver admitted that he almost skipped a game.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMcNair, who died in November at 81, reportedly made the comment during a 2017 owners meeting while discussing how to approach the issue of players kneeling during the national anthem to protest issues of social injustice and police brutality.\n\n\u201cWe can't have the inmates running the prison,\u201d McNair \u2014 a campaign contributor to President Donald Trump \u2014 said at the meeting, according to ESPN.\n\nHopkins: \u2018Hell yeah, I was about to sit\u2019\n\nHopkins, a Colin Kaepernick supporter who has knelt in protest, expounded on his response to McNair\u2019s comments in the GQ interview.\n\n\u201cHell yeah, I was about to sit out the game,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cBut I definitely wasn\u2019t going to practice. A couple of my teammates about to follow me, but they called them back up to the stadium. They tried calling me, but I wasn't going back. Hell no.\u201d\n\nThe game in question was a matchup against the Seattle Seahawks that saw Hopkins and several of his teammates take a knee after he eventually decided to suit up. Hopkins told GQ that he ultimately played in order to not let his teammates down.\n\nHopkins: \u2018It feels like I\u2019m a slave again\u2019\n\nThe seventh-year pro who grew up in South Carolina explained how McNair\u2019s comments felt to a man who\u2019s a descendant of slaves with family members who relayed stories about living in the Jim Crow South.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt's hard for people to understand what that means, when your family was slaves,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cYou can't relate to something like that if your great-uncle's not telling you stories about their parents or their grandparents and what they went through. Not even too long ago, people couldn't even drink out of the same water faucet.\u201d\n\nBasically, Hopkins explained, it made him feel like he was being treated as a slave.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I'm a slave again,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cGetting ran over. Listen to the master, go to work.\u201d\n\nBob McNair founded the Houston Texans and owned the team until he died in 2018. (Getty)\n\nHopkins gives McNair benefit of the doubt\n\nHopkins did go on to call McNair a \u201cgood man\u201d in the interview, giving him the benefit of the doubt of his upbringing.\n\n\u201cWhen you grow up certain places, you talk a certain way,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nHopkins, a three-time Pro Bowler, continued to talk of his support of Kaepernick, noting that before Deshaun Watson arrived in Houston he hadn\u2019t had the benefit of working with a Pro Bowl quarterback.\n\nAfter working with the likes of Tom Savage, Brock Osweiler and T.J. Yates, Hopkins argued that it was obvious that Kaepernick was being blackballed from the NFL.\n\n\u201cAin't no way around it,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cYou can't sugarcoat why Kaep is not playing in the NFL. This dude played in the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "While supporting Colin Kaepernick, DeAndre Hopkins told GQ that comments by late Texans owner Bob McNair made him feel like a slave.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gW01rb_c1EuS9MvTN4Q0fQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hxvC32sSGH.b1_Li1nsrTA--~B/aD0zMTI2O3c9NDY4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7ac47f90-ce7e-11e9-97ef-c8b949e6e457"}
