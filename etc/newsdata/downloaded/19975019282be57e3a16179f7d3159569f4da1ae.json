In her graphic novels and conceptual books, she combines drawing and painting with found material, photographs and written text. Her widely praised memoir, Swimming Studies \u2014 about training as a swimmer for the Olympic trials \u2014 won a National Book Critics Circle Award in 2012. In 2018, she was a judge for the Man Booker Prize.\n\nShapton's latest, called Guestbook: Ghost Stories, is an imaginative work made up of 33 short stories that revolve around the power of objects and ghosts. In addition to text, the vignettes are conveyed through photographs, illustrations, paintings and invented scenes, redefining the very nature of narrative experience.\n\nLeanne Shapton was born in Toronto and grew up in the suburb of Mississauga. She spoke to Eleanor Wachtel from New York City, where she lives and works.\n\nObject of my eye\n\n\"I navigate the world through my love of objects, photographs and the shapes of things. My father was an industrial designer and taught industrial design, so the value of design and objects was instilled in me pretty early. It increased my appreciation for things and gave me a certain design literacy from an early age. I understood that everything around us is industrial design \u2014 that someone has to actually design things, like the snow brushes you buy at a store.\n\n\"Everything is designed. That meant to me that everything has a history and a story. And so, when I look at things, I see layers. I've always done that with things \u2014 I've become attached to blankets or a quilt made by my grandmother who died before I was born and never met. I've always been interested in the stories behind things.\"\n\nEverything is designed. That meant to me that everything has a history and a story.\n\nWhere your eyes go\n\n\"Guestbook: Ghost Stories collects a lot of interesting themes for me. Part of my method in research is asking people their own stories. For instance, with [2006 book] Was She Pretty? I asked people if they were jealous, both from a relationship and sexual perspective. And for Guestbook: Ghost Stories, my questions for people were, 'Do you believe in ghosts? Do you have a ghost story?'\n\n\"More people had ghost stories than jealousy stories. I think it's less a taboo to have a ghost story than to admit that you're jealous.\n\n\"A lot of stories started with, 'One day or one night I woke up \u2026 and there was something at the foot of the bed.' This idea of the 'foot of the bed' came up again and again \u2014 there was a woman at the foot of the bed, there was something at the foot of the bed \u2014 and so on.\n\n\"And so I started thinking, why are we looking at this empty bed? Who is in this real estate where the camera is? What are we looking at when we look at a bed like this? It's supposed to be aspirational and dreamy and informational but the camera's always in the same place. What does this mean?\n\n\n\n\"We are spoon-fed images, over and over again, through advertising and media. I really look at what we collectively look at, in passing and in flipping through catalogues. It's about being thoughtful about where the camera is.\"\n\nPatterns people make\n\n\"I like reading photographs and looking at other people's possessions. What other people collect is, to me, a far more interesting portrait than a family picture or a posed picture at a formal event. You don't get any of that through a face. That's why I like looking at posture \u2014 when people are caught mid-movement. I like to read people indirectly through possessions.\n\n\"I remember a friend of mine in London was house-sitting and threw a dinner party in this stranger's house. I knew that a couple lived there and went room by room to figure out the state of their marriage, just to see how far off I was. By their interior decor, you could tell if they wanted kids. By the size of the shoe, you know how tall a person is, and so on. It was so fun and interesting. And I was on the mark.\"\n\nI like reading photographs and looking at other people's possessions.
