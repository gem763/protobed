Based on those facts alone, there was plenty to like for an Arsenal side which is slowly building some momentum in the Premier League.\n\nThe rest is not immaterial, though, and the ragged nature of their performance here will have left few supporters feeling that a corner has been turned after a chaotic start to the campaign. Arsenal were not as wide open as they have been in previous games, but they remain fragile and vulnerable enough for Bournemouth to feel like they should certainly have taken a point back to the south coast.\n\nThis second-half showing from Emery\u2019s side was as patchy and broken as they come. Bournemouth outplayed Arsenal for most of it, going close to an equaliser more than once, and the outpouring of relief in the Emirates at the final whistle told a story of its own.\n\nFor much of the second period it felt like Arsenal were there for the taking. Only desperate challenges from Matteo Guendouzi and the excellent Calum Chambers preserved their victory, which was made all the more significant by Manchester City\u2019s struggles against Wolves. Despite everything, Emery\u2019s side are only one point behind the reigning champions.", "description": "A first Arsenal goal for David Luiz, a clean sheet for a nervy defence and three points which move Unai Emery\u2019s side into third place.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212212481-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGnvE-VNXSbhg1qqFSd7ePzlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
