And he did that.\"\n\n\u2014 Trump today in the Oval Office\n\nWhat he's saying: Trump repeatedly condemned Bolton's suggestion (more than a year ago) that the U.S. pursue the \"Libya model\" for the denuclearization of North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea reacted furiously at the time. That's unsurprising, given Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was killed in an uprising a decade after ending his nuclear program.\n\n\"What a disaster using that to make a deal with North Korea,\" Trump said. \"I don't blame Kim Jong-un. ... He wanted nothing to do with John Bolton.\"\n\nTrump also said he disagreed with Bolton's views on Venezuela.\n\nBolton repeatedly predicted President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's imminent overthrow after the U.S. backed opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. Trump reportedly grew impatient when rhetoric was not matched with results and said today that Bolton had been \"way out of line.\"\n\nThe big picture: Trump seemed to bristle at the idea that Bolton was the muscle behind his foreign policy, referring to him dismissively as \"Mr. Tough Guy\" and noting his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump claimed a number of qualified candidates had expressed interest in the job and that an announcement would come next week. Earlier Wednesday, Axios reported a list of candidates that Trump is considering.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump said he hoped he and Bolton \"left in good stead,\" but added: \"Maybe we have and maybe we haven't.\"\n\nGo deeper: Bolton's chaotic White House departure", "description": "\"What a disaster using [the Libya model] to make a deal with North Korea.
