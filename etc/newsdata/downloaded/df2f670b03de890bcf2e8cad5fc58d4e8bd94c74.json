(March 10) AP\n\nSinger and producer Pharrell Williams might be best known today for his 2013 earworm \"Happy.\" But there's another song he worked on the same year that left him less than thrilled.\n\n\"Some of my old songs, I would never write or sing today,\" Williams said in GQ's latest cover story. \"I get embarrassed by some of that stuff. It just took a lot of time and growth to get to that place.\"\n\nPharrell said his awakening when it came to the way he represented women in his music came within the last few years. But it wasn't the #MeToo movement, which recently saw its two-year anniversary, that sparked a change of heart.\n\nIt was backlash over the 2013 song \"Blurred Lines,\" performed by Robin Thicke and featuring Williams, who also co-wrote and produced the track. It raised eyebrows for questionable lyrics like, \"I hate these blurred lines / I know you want it / But you're a good girl,\" and for the music video, which featured models (including Emily Ratajkowski) topless.\n\nPharrell Williams (from left), T.I. and Robin Thicke perform at the 2013 BET Awards.

And I would be like, 'Wow.' They would have me blushing. So when there started to be an issue with it, lyrically, I was, like, 'What are you talking about? There are women who really like the song and connect to the energy that just gets you up. And I know you want it \u2013 women sing those kinds of lyrics all the time.' So it's like, 'What's rapey about that?' \"\n\nHe continued: \"And then I realized that there are men who use that same language when taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn't matter that that's not my behavior. Or the way I think about things. It just matters how it affects women. And I was like, 'Got it. I get it. Cool.' My mind opened up to what was actually being said in the song and how it could make someone feel.\"\n\nWilliams now operates under a different level. He's more interested in ideas surrounding restrictive gender roles. The only lines he's talking about blurring now are between masculinity and femininity.\n\n\"I realized that we live in a chauvinist culture in our country,\" he said. \"Hadn't realized that. Didn't realize that some of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/15/pharrell-how-robin-thicke-blurred-lines-backlash-opened-his-eyes/3983316002/", "description": "Pharrell Williams opened up about how backlash over 2013's \"Blurred Lines\" changed the way he thought about consent, gender roles and his platform.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published A.M.
