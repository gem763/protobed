Not only do the allegations suggest that Mr. Trump was using the power of his office to extract political gains from a foreign power, they argued, but his administration is actively trying once again to prevent Congress from finding out what happened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do any more to contribute to the divisiveness in the country, but my biggest responsibility as an elected official is to protect our national security and Constitution,\u201d said Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, adding that it is \u201cbecoming more and more difficult\u201d for Democrats to avoid an all-out impeachment inquiry.\n\nSeveral first-term lawmakers who had opposed impeachment conferred privately over the weekend to discuss announcing support for an inquiry, potentially jointly, after a hearing scheduled for Thursday with the acting national intelligence director, according to Democratic officials familiar with the conversations. A handful of them declined to speak on the record over the weekend, with some still reluctant to go public and others looking for cues from Ms. Pelosi and their freshman colleagues.\n\nRepresentative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey freshman who has supported an inquiry, said the fresh revelations made it clear that Congress must move more decisively.\n\n\u201cThere are lines being crossed right now that I fear will be erased if the House does not take strong action to assert them, to defend them,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf all we do is leave it up to the American people to get rid of him, we have not upheld the rule of law, we have not set a precedent that this behavior is utterly out of bounds.\u201d\n\nThe Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Sunday morning that the accumulating evidence of wrongdoing, and of a presidential cover-up unfolding in real time, left the House with few other options. Mr. Schiff spoke with Ms. Pelosi before making his remarks to coordinate their statements, two people familiar with their conversation said, a sign that the speaker may be more comfortable moving toward a direct discussion of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment,\u201d Mr. Schiff said on CNN. \u201cBut if the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.\u201d", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned of a \u201cnew chapter of lawlessness\u201d and a turning point in the House investigation of President Trump.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Jonathan Martin", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/us/22DC-IMPEACH/22DC-IMPEACH-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
