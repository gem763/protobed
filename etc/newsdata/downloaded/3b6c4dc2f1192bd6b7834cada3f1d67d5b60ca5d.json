Shameful using women as bargaining chips!\"\n\nNorthern Ireland minister Robin Walker has said that unless the Northern Ireland executive is formed by Monday, the Government is under statutory requirement to allow access to abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nBut he insisted that he wold prefer that it was the Northern Ireland Assembly was tackling the issue.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nEarlier this year the Commons divided by 332 votes to 99 in favour of a motion that says that the government must lift the ban in the province if a new executive at the Stormont assembly is not in place by 21 October.\n\n\n\nMr Walker said: \"Mr Deputy Speaker, as colleagues across this House are also aware, should no executive be formed by the October 21 deadline set out in the Northern Ireland Executive Formation Act, this Government is under a statutory duty to change the law in Northern Ireland on access to abortion services, to introduce same-sex marriage and opposite sex civil partnerships, and also to introduce a new victims' payment scheme.\n\n\n\n\"Whilst every effort is being made to restore an executive, I must also take steps to ensure the Government is able to meet its obligations should an executive not be formed in the statutory deadline.\"\n\n\n\nHe added: \"The British and Irish Governments both share the view that there remains an opportunity in the coming days to reach an accommodation - indeed the Secretary of State is not here in person to start the debate as he has decided to stay in Northern Ireland to continue engaging with the parties this evening.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMs Creasy said in the House of Commons: \"The last time that there were official cross-party talks was in July, we are now literally five days away from this Bill becoming an act and therefore the provisions around abortion and same-sex marriage being extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\n\"What could it possibly be in the next couple of days that has made the Government suddenly have a renewed sense of vigour to reopen these talks and to offer the idea that abortion could be suspended in Northern Ireland to the people when there's a Brexit deal to be done?\"\n\nMr Walker continued: \"I would prefer and the Government would prefer that the Northern Ireland Assembly was considering reforms of Northern Ireland's abortion law - this is as I have a noted a highly sensitive and devolved issue and as such, would be best addressed by Northern Ireland's locally elected, locally accountable political representatives.\"\n\n\n\nHe added: \"In the absence of a restored assembly and executive the Secretary of State has taken steps to ensure the Government is ready to ensure its obligations.\"", "description": "Stella Creasy suggested the government had 'sold out' women to get support from the hardline party", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637448.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-2019-Labour-Party-Conference-Day-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
