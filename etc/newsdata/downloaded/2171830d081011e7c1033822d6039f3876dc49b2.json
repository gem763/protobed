Rainbow Six Quarantine never had a specific release date though, just some time in 2020.\n\nThe call stated merely that the decision had been made to increase development time for the games, but Watch Dogs releasing the same week as Final Fantasy VII Remake was almost certainly also a factor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough maybe Ubisoft might have reconsidered Gods & Masters \u2013 their more fantastical take on Greek mythology \u2013 if they\u2019d know about The Last Of Us Part 2, as that month is now suddenly looking a little empty.\n\nThe financial call also mentioned a \u2018sharp\u2019 downward revision in revenues expected from the recent Ghost Recon Breakpoint and, to a lesser extent, The Division 2.\n\nThis suggests that both games have underperformed, and certainly it always seemed that way from their chart performance and general lack of buzz.\n\nThat in turn has led to the company lowering its targets for the current financial year, which is already having an expectedly negative effect on their share price.\n\nUpdate:\n\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has offered a little more information about the situation, admitting that Breakpoint\u2019s \u2018critical reception and sales during the game\u2019s first weeks were very disappointing\u2019.\n\nHis other explanations for Breakpoint\u2019s poor performance seem rather contradictory though, as he stated that the implementation of \u2018gameplay innovations\u2019 had not been perfectly implemented and yet at the same time the game, \u2018did not come in with enough differentiation factors\u2019.\n\nBy comparison, The Division 2 didn\u2019t do as badly but Guillemot spoke about the difficulties in getting people excited about a sequel to a live game and that there would have to be \u2018more time\u2019 between each iteration in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: The Division 2 is the best-selling game of 2019 claims Ubisoft\n\nMORE: Ubisoft announces over 100 games for Uplay+ subscription service\n\nMORE: Ubisoft dev wants to know if you\u2019d play a single-player The Division spin-off", "description": "Ubisoft is also putting back the releases of Rainbow Six Quarantine and Gods & Monsters, as Breakpoint sales disappoint.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/WDL_screen_authoritarianstate_e3_190610_2_1560170660.15pmPST-0aa5_1571937766.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
