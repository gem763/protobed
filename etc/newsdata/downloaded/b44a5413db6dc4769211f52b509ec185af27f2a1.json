Job security\n\nCUPE secured $78 million each year to create and protect up to 1300 jobs, which includes:\n\n$58 million share of the Local Priorities fund, created by the previous Liberal government and put on the chopping block by the Ford government, protecting about 1,000 jobs.\n\n$20 million a year to bring back jobs and service hours lost when members' contracts expired on June 30, 2019, protecting about 300 full-time equivalent jobs.\n\n2. Salary and benefits\n\nWorkers will get a one per cent increase each year for the duration of the three-year contract.\n\n3. Sick leave\n\nThe sick leave plan stays the same at 11 fully paid sick days and 120 short-term leave days paid at 90 per cent pay.\n\nStandards for sick notes will be set across the province.\n\n4. Holidays\n\nAll CUPE workers will get Family Day off, which wasn't always the case before. Previously, some workers, like custodians, worked on the holiday.\n\n5. Community use funding\n\nSchool boards will get $600,000 to offset the cost of workers staying to keep schools open outside of class hours for community use.\n\n6. Training\n\nAll staff will receive a half day of training about violence in the workplace.\n\nThe leaders of the locals will meet Oct. 12 to endorse on the deal. If that happens, CUPE members will vote for ratification by the end of October.\n\nElementary and secondary school teachers are still in talks with the province.", "description": "CUPE education support staff and the province hammered out an 11th hour deal that narrowly avoided a strike in Ontario.
