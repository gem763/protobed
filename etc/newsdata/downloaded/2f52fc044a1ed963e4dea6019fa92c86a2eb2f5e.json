Before I met my husband, I lived on my own and I learned how to get around by myself. I didn\u2019t need anyone for anything. I was capable of handling life without any help.\n\nTruth is, not accepting help doesn\u2019t make me stronger or more independent.\n\nHere's Another Mom's POV On Housework: I Think It\u2019s Important To Have A Clean House \u2014 And That Doesn\u2019t Make Me A Bad Woman\n\nIn fact, now that I am a working mother with two kids, I know that asking for help makes me actually makes me a better person and a better mother.\n\nCleaning my house is one of my least favourite tasks and it definitely got shelved more times than I would like to admit.\n\nIt didn\u2019t come naturally to me. So even after entering parenthood, I continued on doing it by myself. I rushed home from work in order to pick my kids up and get dinner ready. I spent weekends getting through the piles of laundry that somehow turned into a mountain from one week to the next.\n\nIt was exhausting and draining.\n\nI gave it my all and yet as hard as I tried, I struggled to keep up. I made homemade meals every night for dinner, but dishes stayed in the drying tray instead of being put away. There were always clean clothes available, but they tended to stay folded in the laundry basket for a lot longer than I would have liked.\n\nAnd one of my least favourite tasks got shelved more times than I would like to admit: cleaning my house.\n\nHere's A Dad's Perspective On Family Chores: We Don\u2019t Fight About Housework And Here\u2019s Why\n\nI don\u2019t remember the first time my mother offered to clean my house, but I do remember feeling self conscious that my house was obviously in need of some TLC. I took it as a sign that I was failing.\n\nThe sheer exhaustion forced me to accept the help and it felt liberating.\n\nI was supposed to be able to do it all. That\u2019s what mothers do. They go to work, take care of kids, cook great meals, bake fresh muffins and still have time to go to the gym and care for themselves.\n\nGoodness, I was trying.\n\nThe sheer exhaustion forced me to accept the help and it felt liberating. Finally being able to say I can\u2019t do it all and have it done well was like a weight lifting off my shoulders. Having a clean house left me feeling ready to face every day. And it was so wonderful to finish a long week with a clean house.\n\nSoon enough, my mother cleaning my house became a little more frequent. If we went away on vacation, she would come over and clean so that we came home to a spotless home. If she had a day off work, she\u2019d throw the offer out. I would gratefully accept.\n\nBut I felt guilty. My mother had a full-time, demanding job and she was coming to my house to clean up. How could I ask this of her?\n\nYou'll Also Love: Family Dinners Are A Lot Of Work With Little Reward \u2014 So I\u2019m Done\n\nThen my mother retired. She went from working long hours, travelling and having a lot of responsibility to nothing. It was winter, she was stuck in the house and she was bored.\n\nOne day I called home to chat and my father frustratedly whispered, \u201cShe\u2019s pacing the living room. I don\u2019t think she can do this.\u201d\n\nAfter retirement, the offer to clean our house became a weekly thing. Every Friday, my mum would show up carrying her caddy filled with cleaning supplies and get to work.\n\nI learned to let go of the shame that came with the fact that I was an adult and my mother was cleaning my house.\n\nWhen I would thank her with a slight hint of embarrassment in my voice she explained, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t offer if I didn\u2019t want to do it. It\u2019s my way of helping you. I know how hard it is to raise a family with two working parents and we didn\u2019t have anyone to help out.\u201d\n\nI learned to let go of the shame that came with the fact that I was an adult and my mother was cleaning my house. It became a well-known fact: our neighbour would pop over and offer to walk the dog while she cleaned. Co-workers expressed how amazed they were that I had this help.\n\nOne time when a door-to-door salesperson came by my mother answered, \u201cI\u2019m just the cleaning lady,\u201d and we had had a great laugh about it.\n\nThe thing is, my mother is the best \"cleaning lady\" I know. She\u2019s amazing at cleaning. My house is spotless.\n\nI don\u2019t feel the need to clean before she comes. I\u2019m not ashamed that I haven\u2019t passed a vacuum all week. I don\u2019t feel the need to pretend.\n\nAnother Favourite By This Author: We\u2019re All Making Parenting Harder Than It Really Needs To Be\n\nAnd my mother doesn\u2019t judge me for it. She understands that I\u2019m essentially working two jobs. After work, I spend my evenings running my kids to their activities. We prepare a home cooked meal every evening and eat as a family without fail and that means more to me than a perfectly tidy house.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few months since my parents retired. My mother is building her post-retirement life. She\u2019s getting involved in wonderful things and my parents are travelling often, so months go by where the cleaning is left to us. And it\u2019s nowhere near as clean as when my mum comes over.\n\nSo for now, while my life is steeped in chaos and confusion, I will accept the help. I will welcome my mother into my home to practice her life saving magic of tidying up. I will spend that extra time hanging out with my kids, reading books and enjoying life. I know that this won\u2019t last forever, but while I have it, I will keep my head held high. And if someone comments on how clean my house is I will make sure that my mom gets the credit she deserves.", "description": "I don\u2019t remember the first time my mother offered to clean my house but I do remember feeling self conscious that my house was obviously in need of some TLC.
