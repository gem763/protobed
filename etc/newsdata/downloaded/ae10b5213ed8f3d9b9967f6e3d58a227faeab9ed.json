No such luck for the beleaguered Arsenal manager Unai Emery, who saw all his team\u2019s penalties in the shoot-out scored apart from that fourth taken by Dani Ceballos and saved by Caoimhin Kelleher.\n\nIt was a marvellous game but that, one suspects, will be scant comfort to a manager who cannot catch a break. Goals everywhere, the famous 4-4 Premier League scoreline between these two clubs from April 2009 was equalled before the hour and there was more to come, including a brilliant fifth for Arsenal dispatched by 20-year-old Joe Willock that might have decided the game.", "description": "As the champions of Europe, and the leaders of the Premier League, Liverpool are supposed to be above such preoccupations as the Carabao Cup but when you have shared ten goals over 90 crazy minutes of a wonderful absurdity of a match then why not just go for it?", "authors": ["Sam Wallace", "Alan Tyers", "Chief Football Writer", "Live Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214647647-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1TYULLf6uJ0HC15x5gRMXJxWLfs5mAvkbXYQqrLnBas.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
