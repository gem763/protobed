\u2018real risk\u2019 of death after losing UK citizenship", "language": "en", "text": "Isis bride Shamima Begum is fighting the Home Office decision to strip her of British citizenship (Picture: PA/BBC)\n\nLosing her British citizenship put Isis bride Shamima Begum at \u2018real risk\u2019 of torture or death, a court has heard.\n\nThe east London schoolgirl who travelled to Syria to marry an Islamic State fighter has today launched a legal challenge against the decision to remove her citizenship.\n\nShamima, now 20, left the UK with two other teenagers in February 2015 and lived under Isis rule for more than three years.\n\nShe was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February this year.\n\nFormer home secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of her British citizenship after she asked to return to the UK, a decision her lawyers argue was unlawful as it rendered her stateless.\n\nSuch a decision is lawful only if an individual is entitled to citizenship of another country.\n\nToday, lawyers acting on her behalf began proceedings against the Home Office before the High Court and the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).\n\nShamima Begum\u2019s third child died days after being born in a Syrian refugee camp (Picture: ITV)\n\nSIAC is a specialist court which hears challenges to decisions to remove someone\u2019s British citizenship on national security grounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the start of the four-day hearing in London, Tom Hickman QC said the situation in the al-Roj camp in which Shamima is currently being held is \u2018incredibly fragile and dangerous\u2019.\n\nIn written submissions, he described conditions at the camp \u2013 where Shamima\u2019s third child died in March \u2013 as \u2018wretched and squalid\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018The tragic death of the appellant\u2019s infant child demonstrates that fact.\u2019\n\nMr Hickman said Shamima \u2013 who is of British-Bangladeshi heritage \u2013 \u2018is not considered a national of Bangladesh and was therefore rendered stateless by the deprivation decision\u2019.\n\nHe submitted that the Bangladeshi courts \u2018would determine that the appellant did not automatically acquire Bangladeshi citizenship having been born outside Bangladesh as a UK citizen by birth\u2019.\n\nHe referred to evidence from an expert in Bangladeshi law, who says that it is \u2018nearly impossible that any court in Bangladesh would rule against the government\u2019, which has publicly denied Shamima is a citizen of Bangladesh.\n\nShamima Begum passing through security barriers at Gatwick Airport (Picture: AFP/Getty)\n\nShamima married an Isis fighter 10 days after arriving in Islamic Stater territory in Syria (Picture: PA)\n\nMr Hickman said the court also had to decide \u2018whether the deprivation decision gave rise to a real risk of death or degrading and inhuman treatment\u2019.\n\nHe said conditions in al-Roj and in the al-Hawl camp \u2013 from which Shamima was moved for her own safety in February \u2013 breached her human rights.\n\nThe decision to strip her of citizenship \u2018had the effect and was designed to prevent\u2019 Shamima from returning to the UK, leaving her \u2018abandoned\u2019 in a detention camp, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added this meant she \u2018cannot have a fair and effective appeal\u2019 as she is unable to speak confidentially with her lawyers or give evidence.\n\nThe Home Office\u2019s barrister Jonathan Glasson QC argued in his written case that stripping Shamima of UK citizenship did not leave her stateless.\n\nHe argued she \u2018was a Bangladeshi citizen by descent, in accordance with Bangladeshi law\u2019.\n\nHe also submitted that she \u2018has not been placed at risk of ill-treatment\u2019 as a result of the decision to revoke her British citizenship.\n\nInstead, he argued: \u2018Any risk that the appellant does face arose, and continues to persist, as the result of the appellant having travelled to Syria and aligned with Isis and is wholly unrelated to the deprivation decision.\u2019\n\nAmira Abase, Kadiza

Raqqa in Syria.\n\nShamima married Dutch convert Yago Riedijk 10 days after arriving in Isis territory, with her schoolfriends also reportedly marrying foreign jihadi fighters.\n\nShe told The Times in February that she left Raqqa in January 2017 with her husband but her children, a one-year-old girl and a three-month-old boy, had both since died.\n\nHer third child died shortly after he was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMrs Justice Elisabeth Laing is expected to reserve her judgment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
