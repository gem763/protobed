Utico chairman Rashid Al Balooshi and Mr Tan have said that they will discuss with all other advisers to recommend they agree to the fee limit, according to the statement.\n\nHowever, the potential white knight also warned that it will shrink the S$300 million equity injection to S$200 million by early next week if Hyflux still has not signed the definitive restructuring agreement by then.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\u201cThis continuous loss of time has a great impact on the holding value of Hyflux,\u201d Utico said on Thursday.\n\nThe original proposed rescue package involves Utico taking an 88 per cent stake in Hyflux through a S$300 million equity injection for senior unsecured creditors, as well as a S$100 million shareholder loan.\n\nIn addition, it is offering two possible options to the 34,000 retail perpetual securities and preference (PNP) shareholders hoping to recover the S$900 million they invested in Hyflux. One option is a payout totalling S$50 million - based on small investors (who had invested S$2,000-3,000) each receiving 50 per cent of their holdings, up to S$1,500 per investor. The other option is a S$100 million payout over four years plus a 4 per cent stake in the enlarged Utico group.\n\nExcluding the equity injection, the other portions of the package will remain the same even if the restructuring agreement is not signed by early next week, Utico said on Thursday.\n\nLast week, advisers and a delegation from Hyflux led by chief executive Olivia Lum visited Dubai to discuss pending issues.\n\nAn agreement on board representation was reached, the utility firm said in the statement. \u201cCurrently, any Hyflux board member can resign without responsibility. But we want some of them to stay during and after this (restructuring) process, hence our flexibility in understanding their situation,\u201d a Utico spokesman told The Business Times on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hyflux said its executive vice-president and group chief financial officer, Lim Suat Wah, will go on sabbatical leave from Nov 8.\n\nParties will also continue to discuss a trust mechanism structure for obtaining PNP investors\u2019 binding consent for the rescue deal, Utico said on Thursday. This follows an Aug 1 informal town hall where most of the 43 representative PNP attendees had voted in favour of Utico\u2019s offer.\n\nA key item still outstanding is the management oversight regarding the consent and consultation provisions in the agreement, which Utico said could be a possible deal breaker, according to the statement.\n\nUtico reiterated its concern over \u201cvalue leakage\u201d in Hyflux as the talks drag on, and a possible impact on the bottom lines of both companies.\n\nIt stressed that time is of the essence, seeing as other parties are eyeing Hyflux\u2019s assets. These investors include Mitsubishi for the TuasOne project, as well as Spain\u2019s Valoriza and Europe\u2019s Aqualia and Suez Group for the Algeria project, Utico said. The minority shareholders of the Qurrayat project in Oman have also agreed to take over the plant, it added.\n\nHyflux had told the court last month that more than one rescuer stand ready to invest in the debt-laden firm, even if a deal with Utico were to fall through.\n\nHyflux has not responded to a request for comment on the announcement.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - UNITED Arab Emirates utility firm Utico on Thursday announced that it had agreed in principle with Hyflux to cap all advisers fees at S$40 million. .
