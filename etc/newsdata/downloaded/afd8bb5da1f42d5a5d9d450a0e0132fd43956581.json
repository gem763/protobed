The factual findings about a third issue, the classification review that found Comey had taken home a document that included \u201cconfidential\u201d information, said that those conducting the review would \u201cnot be shocked\u201d if others found the information to be unclassified. A judge ultimately found that just one word in the memo was confidential.\n\nBecause the factual findings section does not present compelling evidence on these three points, the analysis section at times strains to support its conclusions\u2014and in some places introduces new information.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s the conclusion that Comey improperly disclosed Trump\u2019s request that he drop the investigation into Michael Flynn (i.e. \u201cI hope you can let this go\u201d) to his friend Daniel Richman, who then told the New York Times. For the first time, the report in the second section cites Comey\u2019s colleagues\u2019 response to his action. \u201cMembers of Comey\u2019s senior leadership team used the adjectives \u2018surprised,\u2019 \u2018stunned,\u2019 \u2018shocked,\u2019 and \u2018disappointment\u2019 to describe their reactions to learning that Comey acted on his own to provide the contents of Memo 4, through Richman, to a reporter.\u201d\n\nThe report later also claims there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that his colleagues used those words because he violated the FBI duty to safeguard investigative matters. But if there were truly no doubt, then the report could have shown that by citing those witnesses stating that themselves. Since the report relies on this language in its analysis of two different findings, those reactions should be included, with full context, in the factual findings section.\n\nThen there\u2019s the report\u2019s claim that, in releasing that same memo, Comey had revealed non-public investigative information. To back this up, the report includes two lengthy footnotes on former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates\u2019s extensive testimony to Congress about her discussion with White House Counsel Don McGahn about Flynn\u2014testimony that revealed a great deal about the status of the FBI\u2019s Flynn investigation as it existed on the day she got fired. These footnotes attempt to argue that Yates\u2019s disclosures were less substantive than Comey\u2019s repeated references to Trump describing the calls Flynn had made to Russia\u2019s ambassador (calls that were publicly disclosed) and insisting that Flynn had done nothing wrong. The second footnote describes that information by asserting, \u201cComey\u2019s disclosure of Memo 4 provided the public with details relevant to the Flynn investigation.\u201d\n\nBut what Yates\u2019s testimony demonstrates is that Yates had, without objection from the Justice Department, introduced a great deal of information about the investigation into Flynn into the public record before Comey\u2019s disclosure. Furthermore, the report cannot claim that he revealed details about the investigation itself. The actual new information that the memo disclosed was a description of how the president had, in highly unusual fashion, tried to end the investigation into Michael Flynn. The memo could only have disclosed investigative information if the president himself was being investigated\u2014and he wasn\u2019t yet.\n\nThe inspector general might have argued that fielding a request from the president to end an ongoing investigation is part of that investigation itself. But it tellingly does not lay out that case, instead merely claiming that such a request is \u201crelevant\u201d to the investigation.\n\nMore generally, the report does not discuss whether presidential efforts to intervene in investigations, in violation of department rules about proper communication channels and chain of command, constitute the official business of the FBI director. The report does, however, lay out abundant evidence that such efforts are not normal. It quotes former FBI General Counsel Jim Baker stating that any one-on-one meetings are \u201cquite outside the norm of interactions between the FBI Director and a President of the United States.\u201d It describes Baker and Comey\u2019s repeated efforts to address Trump\u2019s direct communications: After Trump asked Comey to let the Flynn investigation go, the report quotes Comey as saying he \u201ctook the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened\u2014him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind\u2014was inappropriate and should never happen.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump called Comey directly about an intelligence investigation on March 9, 2017, Comey called then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions immediately, \u201cto keep the Attorney General in the chain of command between [Comey] and the President.\u201d The last memo records Comey reviewing again the proper channels for the president to intervene in investigations; the report\u2019s discussion of it notes that Comey\u2019s chief of staff shared the details in real time with the proper chain of command.\n\nIs this what constitutes official business? This is what the inspect general\u2019s report would have you believe: that the president asking Comey to do things that break the FBI\u2019s rules is part of the FBI director\u2019s job\u2014and hence, Comey is at fault for airing that official business to his associates and ultimately the press. The report treats a memo recording the president demanding that he \u201c\u2018lift the cloud\u2019 created by the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election\u201d as official business, implying that Comey should have done what the president asked of him.\n\nThis report could have been a review of why the Justice Department\u2019s chain of command never found a way to stop Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to influence investigations in ways that violated Justice Department rules and guidelines. The report\u2019s revelation that someone handed over a full copy of those memos under whistleblower protection suggests it probably should have. Of course, that report could only have reviewed the failures of the attorney general and his deputies in the Russia investigation, when in fact the violations were caused by the president\u2014someone the inspector general has no jurisdiction over. Instead, after significant public pressure from the president and reportedly private pressure from his lackey Attorney General William Barr, the report instead faults Comey for trying to do something about it.\n\nComey may well be guilty of retaining memos that constitute official records. But to make that case, the inspector general would first have to establish that it is part of the FBI director\u2019s official duties to let the president interfere in ongoing investigations. Needless to say, it has not done that.\n\nInstead, the report provides compelling proof that Comey is a hypocrite and a grand-stander, while dodging the critical question of what the Justice Department can do in the face of the president\u2019s ongoing efforts to dismantle the protections on its investigative integrity.", "description": "The inspector general\u2019s report strains mightily\u2014and unconvincingly\u2014to condemn the former FBI director for his memos about the president.", "authors": ["Marcy Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/5d8e9eba11d26d124cef548fc496239a2482f1d4.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
