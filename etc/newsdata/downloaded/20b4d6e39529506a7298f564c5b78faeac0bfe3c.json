Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts or cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due to tell ambassadors for the 27 member states at 1pm whether there is an agreement to be signed off by leaders when they meet at a summit on Thursday.\n\nThe prime minister is expected to brief his cabinet on the situation at 4pm before addressing a scheduled meeting of the 1922 Committee in the evening.\n\nDespite the DUP\u2019s observations, Downing Street hopes that pro-Brexit Conservative MPs will back the agreement under discussion.\n\nSteve Baker, the leader of the ERG, had emerged from a meeting in No 10 saying he was \u201coptimistic that it is possible to reach a tolerable deal that I am able to vote for\u201d, and later told fellow Eurosceptics to \u201ctrust in\u201d the prime minister.\n\nUnder the deal being negotiated, Northern Ireland would not be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory, but the bloc\u2019s full customs code would have to be enforced in the Irish Sea.\n\n\u201cNorthern Ireland would de jure be in the UK\u2019s customs territory but de facto in the European Union\u2019s,\u201d one diplomatic source said of the tentative agreement.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s nervousness is matched in Paris and Berlin. Speaking in Paris, a senior French official advised \u201cextreme prudence\u201d about the chances of a deal being struck that would satisfy the EU\u2019s capitals.\n\nThe EU member states are yet to see the legal text that Barnier had demanded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the Irish who will make the deal,\u201d the official said. \u201cYes, there are better atmospherics, but what matters is the content, and we have seen nothing yet. Whatever it is, we will want to look at it in very serious detail.\u201d\n\nGerman government officials said reaching a deal this week was an ambitious target and that agreeing on the technical issues could require another two months of talks, unless the UK made significant enough concessions.", "description": "Prime minister fighting to get Democratic Unionists to back deal with Brussels", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/937596849031d67dea0dd34e8043b5ecf139c3cf/0_76_2117_1270/master/2117.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=365b684c74a53c090a31b05c6d80f2c6", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
