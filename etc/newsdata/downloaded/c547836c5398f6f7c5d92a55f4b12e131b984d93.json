We\u2019re going to make it happen, it\u2019s everything easy, everything is set up there, just come. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nIn his last fight before his UFC debut, Azaitar (12-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC) headlined an event in his home country of Morocco in 2018, at Brave Combat Federation 14, where he scored a 32-second knockout, defending his lightweight title.\n\n\u201cI already had one fight in Morocco, MMA fight, we have everything,\u201d Azaitar said. \u201cWe have a good healthcare, we have good infrastructure, we have good flights, we have good hotels, we have good venues, we have everything already in Morocco. Some people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in Morocco but my brother Kamaru Usman and Henry Cejudo just came back from Morocco and they saw, and they can tell you.\u201d\n\nThe Azaitars are some of the most popular athletes in Morocco, and even have a camp set up in the city of Rabat, where they often train. With UFC middleweight champion Adesanya recently plugging Morocco as an ideal first UFC visit to an African nation, it could become a targeted destination for the UFC in the near future.", "description": "Ottman Azaitar working with the UFC to bring an event to Morocco, confident it'll happen in the near future.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ottman-azaitar-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
