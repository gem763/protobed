It included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'\n\nHis support for the protests in the Chinese-ruled city prompted anger in Beijing and caused outrage among Chinese fans and the team's business partners in the key NBA market.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star for Houston and helped build the NBA's following in China.\n\nSome businesses have said they will no longer cooperate with the Rockets and Chinese broadcasters have vowed not to show the team's games.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV's sports channel has said it would suspend any further broadcasts of the Rockets' matches starting from Sunday.\n\nTencent Sports, which is the NBA's digital partner in China, also said it would suspect live streaming for future Rockets games. They also said they would not cover or post news about the team.\n\nSponsors have also been pulling the plug in the wake of the drama.\n\nHouston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologized on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted over the weekend that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nRockets star James Harden (above) on Monday apologized to China as the team and the NBA were forced into defensive mode when China's state broadcaster yanked Rockets games from the air and sponsors abandoned them\n\nTHE NBA'S STATEMENT ON MOREY'S TWEET 'We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. 'While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. 'We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.'\n\nSportswear brand Li-Ning and sponsor Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center said on Sunday they were suspending cooperation with the Rockets.\n\n'We want to express our indignation and strong condemnation,' read a statement from Li-Ning, published on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.\n\n'We have already stopped our cooperation with the Houston Rockets and continue to urge them to give a clear answer on this matter.'\n\nChina's SPD Bank also said on Sunday that it has suspended related marketing activities and publicity.\n\n'SPD Bank Credit Card Center expresses strong protest and opposition to the wrong remarks made by Houston Rockets' General Manager Daryl Morey,' the bank said in a statement on its Weibo account.\n\nNeither statements said whether the decisions were permanent.\n\nRockets star James Harden on Monday apologized to China as the team and the NBA were forced into defensive mode when China's state broadcaster yanked Rockets games from the air and sponsors abandoned them.\n\nIn Tokyo, where the team is playing two exhibition games this week, Harden distanced himself from the controversy raging in the NBA's biggest market outside the U.S.\n\n'We apologize. You know, we love China, we love playing there. For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year,' he said, standing alongside fellow Rockets guard Russell Westbrook.\n\n'They show us the most important love. We appreciate them as a fan base. We love everything there about them and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as organization.'\n\nThe NBA had earlier issued a statement saying it recognized Morey's views 'deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable'.\n\nBut the NBA's attempt to diffuse the situation resulted in fans, as well as several U.S. lawmakers, lashing out and accusing the league of being a 'puppet of Beijing and craven to the lucrative Chinese market'.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz criticized the response of the NBA on Twitter on Sunday\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke also tweeted in response to the statement\n\nFlorida Senator Rick Scott also weighed in accusing the NBA of being more interested in money than human rights\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Julian said China was using its economic power to silence critics\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski tweeted the China was using its economic power to censor speech by Americans in the U.S.\n\nTIMELINE OF ROCKETS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA 2002: The Houston Rockets drafts Chinese basketball player Yao Ming, who goes on to become a star for them and helps build the NBA's following in China 2009: Ming purchases the Shanghai Sharks, his former CBA team July 20, 2011: Hall of Fame center Ming announces his retirement and leaves the Rockets after helping them to build a huge following in China 2016: Shanghai-born Ming is elected to the Hall of Fame February 23, 2017: The Chinese Basketball Association votes unanimously to appoint former Houston Rockets star Ming as its president October 4, 2019: Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweets an image of the Hong Kong activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.' It prompts outrage from Chinese fans with Chinese business partners halting work with the NBA team as a result. October 5, 2019: The Rockets try to distance themselves from the controversy, with owner Tilman Fertitta writing on Twitter that Morey 'does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets... we are NOT a political organization'. October 6, 2019: Morey apologizes, saying he didn't intend to offend fans in China. The NBA issues its own statement, saying it recognizes Morey's views 'have offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.' U.S. lawmakers argue that the NBA's response is shameful and shows how China is using its economic power to censor speech by Americans.\n\nThe furore started when Morey posted a tweet on Friday featuring the message 'Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong' in reference to the four-month old protest movement that has upturned the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nThe post was later deleted and 47-year-old Morey, the NBA's executive of the year in 2018, said his views did not represent the team or league.\n\n'I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,' Morey tweeted.\n\n'I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.'\n\n'I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.'\n\nThe post drew rebuke from the Chinese Basketball Association, which is headed by former Rockets star center Yao Ming, who said it would suspend cooperation with the Rockets.\n\nThe Chinese league said on Sunday via its official social media that it 'strongly disagrees' with Morey's 'improper remarks' regarding Hong Kong.\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said: 'We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.'\n\nThe Chinese-language version issued by the NBA appeared to go further than the English statement, saying: 'We are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey.'\n\nThe NBA added: 'We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.'\n\nThat response sparked fierce criticism from U.S. lawmakers, with Texas Senator Ted Cruz writing: 'As a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong. Now, in pursuit of $, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.'\n\nHe added: 'We're better than this; human rights shouldn't be for sale & the NBA shouldn't be assisting Chinese communist censorship.'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said: 'The only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment.'\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Julian Castro added: 'The United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.'\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association, headed by former Rockets star center Yao Ming, pictured, said it would suspend cooperation with the Rockets and said Sunday via its official social media that it 'strongly disagrees' with Morey's 'improper remarks' regarding Hong Kong\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted the Chinese basketball player Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star for them and helped build the NBA's following there. Greek player Theodoros Papaloukas and China's Yao Ming battle in 2006\n\nOn Friday, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta wrote on Twitter: 'Listen.... @dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization'\n\nOther legislators accused the NBA, no stranger to American politics, of a double standard when it comes to China.\n\nNBA stars and some coaches have been outspoken in their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has urged players to speak out on issues of concern, including questions of police brutality and gun violence.\n\nWhen LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and other players warmed up for games in 'I Can't Breathe' t-shirts in 2014 to protest the arrest that led to the death of an unarmed black man in New York, the league did not impose fines. James, the NBA's biggest star, endorsed Hillary Clinton and campaigned for her in 2016.\n\n'And the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticizing our gov't, is now apologizing for criticizing the Chinese gov't. This is shameful and cannot stand,' New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet.\n\nFans also voiced their concerns over the statement, with one writing: 'Guess the NBA is only as progressive and forward thinking as China allows them to be.'\n\nAnother said they were 'disgusted' by the NBA's statement, adding: 'If you care about democracy, freedom, and American values, let the @NBA know how you feel.'\n\nOthers piled in to say the NBA had 'become puppets of communists', calling the Houston Rockets 'pathetic'.\n\nOne fan tweeted: 'Also, screw the NBA for not supporting Daryl Morey's tweet supporting Hong Kong. If the NBA is really going to become another corporate puppet blinding itself against human rights abuses in China, they should be rightfully called out.'\n\nAnother argued the league had 'bowed to communists' because of money.\n\nThe Rockets are currently in Tokyo for the NBA Japan Games 2019 featuring preseason games against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nFans took to Twitter Sunday in the wake of the league's response to the Houston Rockets general manager's now deleted tweet which consisted of an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong'\n\nAs the team went into defensive mode, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta tweeted on Friday: 'Listen.... @dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.'\n\nNBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said the league recognizes that Morey's tweet 'deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.'\n\nBass added that the league supports individuals 'sharing their views on matters important to them'.\n\n'We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,' Bass said.\n\nThe pressure on the Houston Rockets has not purely been about business.\n\nBasketball fans in China also voiced criticism of the Rockets on Weibo.\n\n'I watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I'm still a Chinese person first and foremost,' said one user in response to the basketball association's announcement.\n\nAnother said: 'We Chinese basketball fans call on either Morey to apologize or the Rockets to fire Morey. If this doesn't happen, then we call on fans to boycott watching Rockets games.'\n\nThe timing of this is particularly awkward for the NBA.\n\nChina has teams in the U.S. playing preseason games this week, the Rockets are about to play two games in Japan and the Los Angeles Lakers - with one of the biggest global sports stars in LeBron James - and Brooklyn Nets set to play Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen, China.\n\nFostering strong relationships with China has been a priority of the NBA for at least three decades.\n\nKobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers (top row center right) former NBA Houston Rockets basketball player Yao Ming (top row center left) and NBA Commissioner David Stern (bottom left) pose with children during the NBA Cares Special Olympics Basketball Clinic in 2013\n\nDwight Howard greets a large crowd of fans after he was introduced as a Houston Rocket along with former Houston Rocket greats Hakeem Olajuwon, Ralph Sampson, Elvin Hayes, Yao Ming and Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey (second right) 2013 in Houston, Texas in 2013\n\nWHAT STARTED THE HONG KONG PROTESTS? The Hong Kong protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill. It has since snowballed into an anti-China campaign/pro-democracy movement amid anger over what many view as Beijing's interference in Hong Kong's autonomy. Demonstrators are concerned over Beijing's perceived increasing influence over the city, which they feel violates the \"one country, two systems\" status the city was promised when Britain handed it over to the People's Republic of China in 1997. The protests have plunged the former British colony into its worst political crisis in decades and pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012. China dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment. Protests continued raging this weekend after the shooting of a 14-year-old boy on Friday night - the second protest victim of police gunfire - stoked fears of more bloody confrontations. An 18-year-old protester was shot at close range by a riot officer last week. He was charged with rioting and assaulting police, while the younger teen was arrested.\n\nThe NBA has a China office, just announced plans to add a gaming team in Shanghai to the NBA 2K League, and officials in both countries say as many as 500 million Chinese watched at least one NBA game last season.\n\nOther criticism came from Tencent, a major media partner of the NBA in China with a streaming deal that is worth $1.5 billion over the next five years, and Chinese state television - both of which said they would not be showing Rockets games.\n\nSeveral NBA players - including major current and former stars like Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant - go to China annually to promote their individual brands, and the World Cup held in China earlier this summer saw countless fans attending in NBA jerseys.\n\nThat underscores Beijing's extreme sensitivity about foreign attitudes toward the ongoing protests that have lately grown in violence. China accuses foreign parties in the U.S. and elsewhere of encouraging the demonstrations.\n\nBrooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai is a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and posted an open letter on his Facebook page late Sunday night saying Morey stepped on what he described as 'a third-rail issue' when it comes to China and Hong Kong.\n\n'By now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China.\n\n'I don't know Daryl personally. I am sure he's a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.'\n\nTsai also partially defended Morey, while urging Chinese fans to 'keep the faith' in the NBA.\n\nHe added: 'I am sure he's a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.'\n\nAnti riot police disperse protesters during the Anti-ERO (Emergency Regulations Ordinance) protest against a newly imposed law banning face masks in public in Hong Kong Sunday\n\nProtestors make fire to block traffic in Hong Kong on Sunday. Protests continued raging this weekend after the shooting of a 14-year-old boy Friday night - the second protest victim of police gunfire - stoked fears of more bloody confrontations\n\nThe Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, said in a commentary that Morey touched China's bottom line: 'Morey's position is hurtful to Chinese basketball fans and is also an affront to the Chinese people.'\n\nPeople's Daily also noted multinational corporations who likewise tested the line on Hong Kong have 'paid a heavy price'.\n\nThe protests that started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill have since snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing's interference in Hong Kong's autonomy that was granted when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nProtests continued raging this weekend after the shooting of a 14-year-old boy Friday night - the second protest victim of police gunfire - stoked fears of more bloody confrontations. An 18-year-old protester was shot at close range by a riot officer last week. He was charged with rioting and assaulting police, while the younger teen was arrested.\n\nChina has pushed strongly for international companies to adhere to its views on the protests.\n\nCathay Pacific lost two executives after the government warned the Hong Kong airline that its employees would be barred from flying over or to the mainland if they joined the protests.\n\nAfter being criticized by Chinese social media users, Fashion brands Givenchy, Versace and Coach apologized for selling T-shirts that showed Hong Kong, as well as the Chinese territory of Macau and self-ruled Taiwan, as separate countries.\n\nLast year, 20 airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa and Air Canada changed their websites to call Taiwan part of China under orders from the Chinese regulator. The White House called the demand 'Orwellian nonsense'.", "description": "Houston Rockets' general manager, Daryl Morey, apologized on Monday for the tweet that included an image of the activists' rally cry: 'Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'", "authors": ["Emily Crane", "Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/22/19415364-0-image-a-2_1570484390471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
