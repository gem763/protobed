He shared some of his artwork and they look so real!\n\n\n\nPansegrouw says: \"These days I mostly draw using Procreate, a digital Sketchbook. No Photoshop or tricks. All still hand drawn, but with less mess and fuss.\n\n\"The main reason for switching to digital was necessitated by the growing international customer base. I have clients in Norway, Sweden, Canada, USA, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\"A drawing can take anywhere from 8 - 15 hours+ to complete.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPansegrouw says: \"I was born in Welkom in the Free State, but currently reside in Mossel Bay, in the Western Cape.\n\nA passion for cars\n\n\"According to my late father, I started drawing cars the moment I could hold a crayon, and I knew the names of every car on the road before I knew the alphabet.\n\nSEE | This reader's retro drawings will take you back in time\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No matter what else I did throughout my life, I never stopped drawing cars. I really am a car nut. Besides drawing cars, I have also fixed and restored quite a few, especially Alfa Romeos.\n\n\"As of February 2018 I was fortunate enough that I could turn my hobby of drawing cars into a full time endeavor. This in no small way thanks to the support and encouragement of the love of my life!\n\n\"You can see more of my work on my Facebook page.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Wheels24 reader Stefan Pansegrouw has an unbelievable talent.
