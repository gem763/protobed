It\u2019s equal parts terrifying and exhilarating. But for many of us, the thrill of living in total hedonism falls away as the novelty of it wears off, and you\u2019re left with just the terrifying part.\n\nResearch released earlier this month found that students at some universities were waiting as long as 84 days for mental health support, and the most up-to-date research from YouGov found that 1 in 4 students suffers with a mental health problem. At Bristol university alone, there have been 13 suspected suicides this year.\n\nThe same research found that while many universities spend upwards of \u00a31m on mental health services, others have less than half of that budgeted for student well-being. Some could not even provide a number for how much they spent on mental health services.\n\nPhoto credit: GEOFF CADDICK - Getty Images More\n\nPart of the difficulty in affecting change, is that student life is often considered an easy, boozy ride. But the reality is often one of debt, loneliness and terrifying uncertainty, which can be extremely tough for many of us.\n\nHere, five people share their experience of grappling with mental health problems while studying at university.\n\nAlexandra, 24\n\n\"I'd struggled with my mental health for years and when you go to university you want to give the best showcase of yourself, so I\u2019d already decided that no-one was going to want to be friends with the girl who was often crying or feeling down for no reason.\n\n\"But bottling my feelings up for my first year took its toll, and it was only when I moved in with close friends in second year that I really let my vulnerability show. They encouraged me to actually talk to someone and discuss medication. They could see that I wasn\u2019t myself; I lashed out, cried for no reason and eventually started removing myself from social situations.\n\nPhoto credit: Mixmike - Getty Images More\n\n\"I was scared to open up, but when I did, I discovered that I had massively underestimated those closest to me. Their support was invaluable and it turned out you\u2019re never the only one at university \u2013 it\u2019s a massive upheaval and although there\u2019s the good (hello \u00a31 Jager bombs and wearing your pyjama t-shirt to lectures) there\u2019s also a lot to adjust to. Looking back I\u2019ve realised just how brave it is to ask for help and admit how you\u2019re feeling, because you might just help someone else do the same.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Lesson 1: you're never the only one", "authors": ["Daniella Scott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2cbDNH_.HHsB1L2g8mKjgg--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/ae08b8bd97495198756a6d95843a4ed0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
