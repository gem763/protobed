Online services are \"increasingly ubiquitous and important in our daily lives,\" MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson wrote, yet the sector counted for the same fraction of gross domestic product in 2016 as it did 35 years earlier\n\nThe metric leaves out many relatively new digital goods due to their lack of upfront cost.\n\nThe researchers concluded that free digital goods \"provide substantial value to consumers even if they do not contribute substantially to GDP.\" Search engines were the highest valued service on average, and music was the least valued.\n\nHere's how much the average person needed to be compensated to give up the following eight popular online services for a year. They're listed in increasing order of cost.\n\nMessaging\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $155 (about R2,200)\n\nMusic\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $168 (about R2,400)\n\nSocial Media\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $322 (R4,700)\n\nE-Commerce\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $842 (about R12,000)\n\nVideo\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $1,173 (about R17,000)\n\nMaps\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $3,648 (about R53,000)\n\nEmail\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $8,414 (about R124,000)\n\nSearch engines\n\nMedian yearly valuation: $17,530 ( about R259,000)", "description": "The team of researchers found that free digital goods \"provide substantial value to consumers even if they do not contribute substantially to GDP.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/142f647947d14e41ad3c546e9290a2ec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
