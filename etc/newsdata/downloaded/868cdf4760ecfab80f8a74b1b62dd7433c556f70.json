Moscow has denied the claims.\n\nWhile in Odessa, Stoltenberg visited four NATO naval ships moored in the harbour and said they demonstrate the \"strong support of NATO to Ukraine\".\n\nMeeting Stoltenberg, Ukraine's deputy prime minister Dmytro Kuleba stressed that Ukraine had \"an ambitious goal to meet the principles and criteria for NATO membership within five years\".\n\nRussia strongly opposes Ukraine's pro-Western trajectory.\n\n\"Nato's doors remain open,\" Stoltenberg said as the two officials spoke in front of Ukrainian students.\n\n\"Sometimes you get the impression that whether Ukraine should be a member of NATO or not is for Russia to decide,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, \"Russia doesn't have a say,\" he added.\n\n\"They do not have any legal and real platform to have any influence over such decision.\"\n\nburs-jza/jj", "description": "NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday welcomed a pullback by the Ukrainian army and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, but reiterated calls for Russia to \"withdraw all their troops\".
