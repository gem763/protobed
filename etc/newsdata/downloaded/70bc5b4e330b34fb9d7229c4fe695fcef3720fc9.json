Reuters reports that an executive order prohibits selling, producing, importing, or advertising e-cigarettes. First offenders could receive up to one year in prison and a 100,000 rupee ($1,400) fine; later violations could cost up to three years and 500,000 rupees. The ban doesn\u2019t apply to actually using e-cigarettes \u2014 but it means users can\u2019t legally buy refills for their vapes.\n\nTraditional cigarettes are legal in India, although they\u2019re highly taxed. E-cigarettes, however, have held a less certain position. The government has been weighing a ban for years, despite concerns over the legality of stopping imports, and Reuters reported on a draft of this week\u2019s order back in August. \u201cThese novel products come with attractive appearances and multiple flavours and their use has increased exponentially and acquired epidemic proportions in developed countries, especially among youth and children,\u201d said a spokesperson from India\u2019s health ministry.\n\nYou can still smoke e-cigarettes, but you can\u2019t buy refills\n\nThis echoes long-standing concerns about e-cigarettes worldwide, particularly the fear that flavored vapes are encouraging young people to try tobacco. These fears intensified in August after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first death due to an unknown lung illness. The CDC has confirmed six more deaths since then, and regulators have pushed forward with plans to limit e-cigarette use. Michigan became the first US state to ban flavored e-cigarettes in early September, and New York followed up with its own ban this week.\n\nSingapore had already banned e-cigarettes, and Japan allows some vaping products but bans the sale of nicotine e-cigarette juice.\n\nReuters reports that India\u2019s health ministry expects its ban to be challenged in court, and supporters of vaping in the country have warned that a ban will deprive smokers of a potentially less dangerous alternative. Research has suggested that vaping is indeed safer than smoking cigarettes, but the full risks remain unknown \u2014 and regulators are being forced to decide whether the device\u2019s benefits for existing smokers outweigh the danger of e-cigarettes becoming a gateway drug to tobacco use.", "description": "India has banned selling, importing, advertising, and producing e-cigarettes amid growing concerns about their health risks and use among young people.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RjMnniG4RxVMfBGctXW80TpE3i0=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13432279/akrales_181108_3053_0047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
