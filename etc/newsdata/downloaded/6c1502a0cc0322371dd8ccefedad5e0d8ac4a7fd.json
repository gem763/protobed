Goldman owns the stake through funds managed by its infrastructure-investing arm.\n\nAbertis, a tollroad manager based in Spain, and GIC, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, have emerged as frontrunners in a competitive sales process for the asset, the people said.\n\nA consortium that includes the alternative asset manager Blackstone Group Inc. and airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac\u00edfico SAB de CV made an offer conditioned on regulatory approvals on tariff rates, the people said. China Merchants Bank Co. also bid, one of the people said.\n\nNo final decision has been made and Goldman could opt to keep the asset or sell it to other suitors, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for Goldman, Blackstone and GAP Airports declined to comment. Representatives for RCO and Abertis didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comments. Representatives for GIC and China Merchants couldn\u2019t be reached for comment outside of business hours.\n\nRCO, which oversees 11 highways spanning 877 kilometers (545 miles) made a cash distribution to shareholders last month of 7 billion pesos, according to its website.
