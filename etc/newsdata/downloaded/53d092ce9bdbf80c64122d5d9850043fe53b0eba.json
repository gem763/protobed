There are few like-minded fellow Senate Republicans, and he\u2019s facing withering attacks by the president\u2019s supporters, including from conservatives back home.\n\nBut Romney was just elected to the Senate last year and has five more years before he faces voters, blunting any immediate blowback despite the president\u2019s calls to \u201cimpeach\u201d him (and, of course, because senators can\u2019t be impeached). He also has a larger mission in mind: Propping up what remains of the GOP\u2019s independence from Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are many young people who might tend to think that the Republican Party is only represented by one point of view, the president\u2019s point of view, were there not people like myself,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWe are not a pup tent\u2026 rather a much larger tent. And we can accommodate different people with different views.\u201d\n\nYet today\u2019s party is not a forum for free-flowing debate about Trump. He\u2019s still popular with the conservative base, and as the GOP looks to defend its narrow Senate majority, most Republicans are riding with the president.\n\nIn fact, outside of foreign policy, Romney said he finds himself seeing \u201ceye-to-eye\u201d with the president on most issues. But stylistically they couldn\u2019t be more different, with Romney\u2019s measured, sometimes awkward style naturally at odds with the bombastic, erratic and combative tactics of Trump.\n\nPerhaps most ironically is that Romney says he and Trump get along fine on a personal level. He met with Trump about a Cabinet position after the 2016 election and Trump endorsed him in his 2018 Senate run and 2012 presidential bid.\n\n\u201cI knew him before politics. It was interesting and entertaining to hang out with him,\u201d Romney recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve been to football games with him. I flew on Trump aircraft from New York down to his home in Mar-a-Lago before it was a club. I\u2019ve had dinner in his home.\u201d\n\nThese days, Romney is staying neutral in the 2020 presidential race \u2014 currently refusing to endorse Trump\u2019s reelection while keeping the door slightly ajar because \u201ccircumstances can change.\u201d He hears the argument that dissent within the party could help a Democrat defeat the president, but says he\u2019s focused on motivating voters \u201cfrustrated or concerned about the president\u201d to not abandon the party writ large and find conservatives they can support.\n\nYet that the 2012 GOP nominee is unlikely to support his successor makes for a combustible relationship.\n\n\u201cI hate to see it. I\u2019ve got a world of respect for Mitt,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). But Trump \u201cthinks if you turn the other cheek too far, you just get it in the neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cCats and dogs,\u201d said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) of the two. \u201cHatfields and McCoys.\u201d\n\n\"Certainly got the fur flying,\" said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\nRomney felt the full force of Trump\u2019s wrath earlier this month after he said it was \u201cappalling\u201d that the president had called for China and Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets calling Romney a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019\u201d and a \"fool\" are among his most intense personal attacks on a sitting Republican. On Wednesday, Donald Trump Jr. shared a \u201cClub for Growth\u201d attack ad airing in Utah and called Romney \u201cbitter and angry.\u201d\n\nRomney is comfortable returning the favor.\n\nOn Thursday he excoriated Trump\u2019s Syria shift from the Senate floor, calling U.S. diplomacy \u201cso weak and so inept\" that Turkey is calling the shots.\n\nIn the interview, he bluntly criticized the president with little regard for a counter-attack, comparing Trump\u2019s Syria policy to a shattered vase that can\u2019t be put back together and saying the problems with Trump\u2019s demands for foreign probes of Biden are \u201cas plain as the nose on your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the administration to know how badly this decision has been received. And what the consequences of his decision are,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIs it OK for the president of the United States to ask a foreign country to investigate a political foe? The answer is no.\u201d\n\nFew Republicans are making the same declaration without qualifying it with an attack on Democrats or asserting that the president has not committed an impeachable offense. Romney notably is neither criticizing nor cheering on the House\u2019s impeachment probe.\n\nRomney\u2019s posture may be taking a toll back home among Trump-supporting Republicans, even though the president barely cleared 45 percent of the vote in Utah in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made some bad comments about Donald Trump, and Donald Trump has done everything we\u2019ve asked him to do,\u201d said Leland Pollock, a Garfield County commissioner. \u201cIf [Romney] decides to run in 2024, I\u2019ll even put my black hat in the ring. I would run myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people who are in love with Mitt Romney right now are the Democrats. And there aren\u2019t a lot of them in Utah,\u201d said Darin Bushman, a Piute County commissioner. \u201cI actually did vote for him. And I regret that to this day. If I had to do it over tomorrow, I would vote for the Democrat.\u201d\n\nRomney says he doesn\u2019t conduct polls in Utah and \u201cgave up trying to be popular in high school.\u201d And state Sen. David Hinkins (R) said that while his constituents wish Romney wouldn\u2019t so quickly criticize the president, there\u2019s also no upside to being a potted plant, either.\n\n\u201cA lot of people wouldn't think much of Romney if he didn\u2019t kick back a little. Trump\u2019s not been the most friendly,\u201d Hinkins said. Utahns know that \u201csometimes President Trump has it coming back to him \u2026 sad part is they love both of them.\u201d\n\nRomney\u2019s fundraising acumen is also still an asset to the party. He\u2019s aiding senators and Senate hopefuls as well as the Utah GOP in trying to take back the state\u2019s Fourth Congressional District won by Democrats in 2018.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to his support of the state party, there\u2019s no doubt that he is a team player,\u201d said Derek Brown, Utah GOP chairman.\n\nAt times, Romney\u2019s Republican colleagues in the Senate have rebutted him in real time as they seek to defend the president.\n\nSen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) called Romney a potential \u201cJeff Flake on steroids\u201d after Romney\u2019s op-ed in January questioning Trump\u2019s character. After Romney rapped Trump for his conversations with the Ukrainian president last month, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) compared Romney to Pelosi.\n\n\u201cThe first reaction shouldn\u2019t be a negative,\u201d Scott said Thursday of Romney\u2019s reactions to Trump. \u201cIt should be: How do we help somebody?\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Romney\u2019s \u201ca person before he gets sworn in the Senate saying [Trump] didn\u2019t have the character to be president.\u201d\n\nStill, few Republican senators wanted to talk about Romney\u2019s now long-running dispute with the president in interviews this week.\n\n\u201cTrump is just going after him with a bat. And I\u2019m struck that I\u2019m not seeing Republican colleagues come to Mitt\u2019s defense,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).\n\nRepublicans just don\u2019t see an upside to refereeing a fight between two of the party\u2019s most prominent figures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to decide to get involved in that. They are two very different guys, they\u2019ve got their issues with each other. That\u2019s their business,\u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who Trump has not lashed despite mild criticisms of the president\u2019s calls for foreign probes into Biden.\n\nYet Democrats must also choose their words carefully. With the president\u2019s allies dinging Romney as a threat to Trump\u2019s presidency, plaudits from the minority party aren\u2019t in Romney\u2019s interests, either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to praise him,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want him to get him in any more trouble than he\u2019s in.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/21/80/6944ad5841d3876e44117653a3fa/190530-mitt-romney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
