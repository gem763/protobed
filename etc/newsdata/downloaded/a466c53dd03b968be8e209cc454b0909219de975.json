The organization\u2019s mission is to preserve big cats and their ecosystems worldwide.\n\nDuring a recent sit-down interview with Penta, Kaplan discussed his endeavors in wildlife conservation.\n\nPenta: There are so many charitable causes to choose from, why wildlife conservation?\n\nThomas Kaplan: First of all, I am active in community and family philanthropy. I am the former president and chairman of the 92nd Street Y, a world-renowned community and cultural center. I\u2019m also on the advisory board of New York\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital Department of Internal Medicine, and have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami.\n\nBut I was passionate about wildlife conservation since a young age. I was born in New York and grew up in Florida. The iconic Florida panther inspired my dream to one day become a wildlife biologist. Around 11 or 12 years old, I started to realize that I didn't have a natural aptitude for science. But I had a very natural aptitude for history, which I studied at Oxford University with a focus on military history.\n\n\u201c We did everything that we could to apply really sound business principles to conservation. \u201d \u2014Thomas Kaplan\n\nI went into business after completing my doctoral degree in history. My relative advantage as a businessman was to be able to translate an understanding of history onto the present and financial markets, which gave me the opportunity to be unusually successful at being able to predict things.\n\nBut I made a vow when I went into business that one day if I was successful and if I had the opportunity, I would return to my first love, which was wildlife conservation.\n\nAnd I was very fortunate to meet a man named Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, who was already a hero of conservation before we met. And we created Panthera in 2006, starting as an idea as a venture capital startup. We did everything that we could to apply really sound business principles to conservation.\n\nWe endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, or WildCRU, creating the leading university-based felid conservation program.\n\nDr. Rabinowitz passed away in August 2018. He was a wonderful hero of wildlife conservation, of the big cats, particularly.\n\nBillionaire investor Thomas Kaplan has two great passions: wildlife conservation and collecting Rembrandt's works. Steve Winter/Panthera\n\nWhat has Panthera achieved so far?\n\nPanthera means \u201cgenus\u201d in Latin, it's the overall grouping of the animals and then the species. We want to be all encompassing.\n\nToday, we're in over 50 countries with 100 projects. We are the only non-government organization solely dedicated to the conservation of all the world's 40 species of wild cats, from the small ones all the way through to the biggest tigers, including jaguars, leopards, lions, cheetahs, and snow leopards.\n\nOne of our signature projects is the jaguar corridor, which has created a genetic biological corridor from Mexico all the way through Central America into South America down to Northern Argentina. And it's become a model for other corridor conservation programs.\n\nWe have a leopard program in South Africa that's very innovative. We discovered that there was a lot of poaching going on in South Africa of leopards to be used as skins for tribal religious rituals. We worked with the tribes and persuaded them to exchange the skins for leopard capes that we make in China. That program has saved thousands of leopards.\n\nTell us more about your partnership with Disney in protecting lions?\n\nDisney will be giving a group of conservation organizations, including Panthera, some of the proceeds from The Lion King. It will add up to several million dollars. But there hasn't been very much money which has been dedicated for lion conservation. At least with Disney, we're starting to see an example of a company doing something to give back to one of its brands.\n\nAnd the lion is the cat that's disappearing in plain sight, because the lion allows itself to be seen. People make the assumption that because it's easy to film them that the lion must be in good shape. The reality is that the population of lions over the last century has fallen from an estimated 200,000 to perhaps 20,000. There are only seven countries in Africa now with more than 1,000 lions. And it's likely that 40% of the remaining lions are located in one country, which is Tanzania.\n\nAdditionally, Panthera is also working with the Saudis to save the Arabian leopard, as part of the wider kaleidoscope of cat conservation. It very much goes with the mission of being local and global simultaneously.\n\nWhat do you find most challenging in wildlife conservation?\n\nVery little money goes to wildlife conservation. Maybe only 2% of global philanthropy goes to the environment at all; of that, species conservation is a very tiny amount.\n\nHowever, 90% of the work that we do as conservationists is working with people, not animals. We need to partner with experts, local communities, and other organizations. I welcome everyone who\u2019s interested in wildlife conservation to email me directly. And I will very happily go speak for other organizations\u2014regardless of whether we have a financial stake\u2014in order to help them raise money.", "description": "Panthera is on a mission to save lions and leopards from Africa to Saudi Arabia", "authors": ["Fang Block", "Thomas Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-119154/social", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
