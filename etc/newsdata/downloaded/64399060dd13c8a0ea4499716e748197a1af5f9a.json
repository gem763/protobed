Exxon\u2019s recent moves are an expansion of this trend at a time of heightened scrutiny facing oil companies and their role fueling climate change.\n\nTo critics, this corporate funding casts doubt on the scientific independence of research, especially from oil and gas producers with bottom lines to protect in the face of policies targeting their products.\n\nTo academics and executives involved, the partnerships are genuine and mutually beneficial as oil companies seek to adopt cleaner energy technologies and universities get deep pockets of money and expertise.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: Princeton University professor Lynn Loo has defended the $5 million she got from Exxon beginning in 2015 as part of her leadership of the school\u2019s Andlinger Center for Energy and Environment.\n\n\u201cWhen I first declared I was going to work with ExxonMobil, I faced a lot of backlash. I said, \u2018Look, they\u2019re an energy company. I want them at the table, and we have information that can help them make responsible decisions.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2014 Lynn Loo, Princeton University engineering professor\n\nWhere it stands: In 2014, Exxon began pursuing an internal goal to establish several partnerships with leading universities \u2014 roughly one per year \u2014 that go far beyond money. Exxon-employed scientists spend significant time at the universities. Many have offices, give guest lectures and co-author peer-reviewed research.\n\nSince 2014, Exxon has helped establish 5 energy centers with 6 universities, including:\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (2014), Princeton University (2015), University of Texas at Austin (2016), Stanford University (2018), and 2 schools in Singapore: Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore (2019).\n\nToday, Exxon announced a new collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology in two cities in India.\n\nEach agreement's funding ranges from $5 million to $25 million, for a total of at least $75 million.\n\nExxon\u2019s agreement with the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratory system, led by the Colorado-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory and announced in May, is unprecedented. At $100 million over 10 years, it\u2019s the largest single non-federal investment in NREL\u2019s 42-year-history.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of technology you see deployed in energy today started in academia. We need a line of sight,\u201d said Vijay Swarup, Exxon\u2019s chief scientist, in a recent interview at the company's research headquarters in Clinton, New Jersey. \u201cEverything we do in research is designed to give us a competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nThe complete reach of Exxon\u2019s university funding and that of other oil and gas companies is hazy.\n\nThe liberal Center for American Progress did a study on the topic in 2010, but public tracking of the trend doesn\u2019t appear to exist nor more recent data.\n\nmore recent data. That report scrutinized, among other agreements, a $100 million investment Exxon put into a Stanford energy initiative earlier last decade.\n\nExxon\u2019s research spans everything from solar panels to batteries, but its two biggest strategies to lower emissions are algae biofuels (to replace jet fuel, for example) and carbon dioxide capture technology, which could enable using oil and natural gas with far fewer emissions.\n\nMost of Exxon\u2019s collaborations appear to be touting cleaner-energy technologies as opposed to, say, extracting oil and gas more efficiently. But none of the actual contracts specify that the research should go toward any one type of technology.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our agreements have an element in them that is addressing the dual challenge: How to scale energy and how to scale energy with lower emissions,\u201d Swarup says.\n\nThe other side: Environmentalists and some academic experts view these collaborations with deep skepticism. They point to decades of oil companies resisting climate policy and claims by environmentalists that companies, especially Exxon, tried to muddle climate science for decades. Exxon denies such allegations.\n\nBenjamin Franta, a JD-PhD student researching this topic at Stanford University, said he wasn\u2019t aware of certain aspects of the collaborations, including Exxon scientists co-authoring papers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea for the fossil-fuel industry to be funding work that is supposed to ultimately put the fossil-fuel industry out of business. The case is made even stronger when you realize just how much disinformation and denial the industry has put out there for so many decades.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Benjamin Franta, Stanford University\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching: To what degree Exxon increases its funding and seeks to commercialize a particular low-carbon technology. Stanford\u2019s Loo says she pushes the company to spend more on research, pointing out that the amount is tiny compared to Exxon\u2019s profits: $21 billion in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just taking their money and are happy with what they\u2019re telling us,\u201d Loo said. \u201cWe\u2019re good partners because we challenge each other.\u201d", "description": "The oil giant is creating new partnerships with universities around the U.S. and the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/_WC7yKoKJ6s4FmYQxgvHhEYAR9E=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/11/1570812744373.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
