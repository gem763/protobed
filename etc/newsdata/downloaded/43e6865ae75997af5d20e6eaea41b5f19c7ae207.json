Beckham is one of the league\u2019s most dynamic receivers, when healthy.\n\nPerhaps this is gamesmanship and Beckham will look like his usual self against the Titans. But it\u2019s worth watching as Beckham makes perhaps the most anticipated debut for the Browns since they came back to the NFL.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
