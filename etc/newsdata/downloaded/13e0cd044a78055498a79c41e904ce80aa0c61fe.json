American says it\u2019s getting less than $20 million a year from its current alliance with Latam.\n\nDelta says it will pay $16 a share, funded with new debt and cash. Delta also is investing $350 million to kick-start the partnership.\n\nIt will get four Airbus A350 jets from Latam and take over its commitment to buy 10 more through 2025.\n\nThe deal needs regulatory approval.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Delta Air Lines is paying $1.9 billion for 20% of Chile's Latam Airlines Group as part of a broader deal that will expand the U.S. carrier's reach in South America.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
