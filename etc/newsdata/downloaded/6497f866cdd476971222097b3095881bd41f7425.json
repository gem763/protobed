Are you Charlie? The Sammie we saw really exists?\u2019\n\nA sheepish James replied: \u2018I don\u2019t know the girl\u2026\n\n\u2018The reason I went as a single mum is, I thought, \u201cWho do I adore more than anyone in the world?\u201d and it\u2019s my mum. She raised me on my own.\n\nGeorgina couldn\u2019t deal with the news (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nPaddy was speechless by the whole thing (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018I did it for all the right reasons. If my mum never had to worry about another bill, that\u2019s everything to me. I thought this character resonated with her really well.\u2019\n\nThe rest of the Circlers came in soon after and laughed off the fact they were all catfished, instead more shocked that Woody was actually real.\n\nIt was actually Ella, who had been blocked in last night\u2019s episode, that had the biggest reaction to Sammie\u2019s real identity.\n\nEmma Willis dropped the bombshell live at the finale, showing her a video of the catfish in action, plotting to take her down.\n\nEveryone was more baffled by Woody being real (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nElla\u2019s expression was the best (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018I had a feeling it was that f**ker,\u2019 she yelled. \u2018Does he even have a kid?\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s such an immoral little s**t! Oh my God, I fell for it hook, line and sinker!\u2019\n\nYou\u2019re not the only one, hun\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m such a moron because I do have little inklings\u2026,\u2019 she added to Emma, before insisting: \u2018There isn\u2019t any [bad blood].\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re already living for the next series.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
