The agency does not get funding from government.\n\nZimbabwe has in the past sold baby elephants to China saying it needed the money for conservation in Hwange.\n\nIn 2016, Zimbabwe put its wild animals up for sale, saying it needed buyers to step in and save the beasts from another devastating drought.\n\nDespite winning support from neighbours Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, Zimbabwe failed to lobby the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to lift a ban on ivory trade at a meeting in August.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
