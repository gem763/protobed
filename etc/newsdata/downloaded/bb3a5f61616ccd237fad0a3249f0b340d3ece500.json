All of those apps are already big battery drainers, since they simultaneously use your phone\u2019s GPS, cellular radio, GPU, and keep the screen on for long periods of time. Running at 90Hz would, in theory, suck up battery even faster. (And Niantic apparently capped Pok\u00e9mon Go at 30 fps earlier this year, anyway.)\n\nMaybe someday Google will let these apps run at 90Hz\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make as much sense why WeChat might not be allowed to run at 90Hz, but Google\u2019s source code for the Pixel 4 apparently says that the app has \u201cpoor performance\u201d at the higher refresh rate.\n\nSmooth Display hasn\u2019t gone over as smoothly as Google may have hoped. Earlier this week, some Redditors figured out that the Pixel 4\u2019s refresh rate falls to 60Hz if its screen is at 75 percent brightness or lower. Google told us that upcoming software updates will enable 90Hz \u201cin more brightness conditions,\u201d so in the future, you might be able to use Smooth Display when the screen isn\u2019t as bright.\n\nWe may now know why Google disabled 90Hz at lower brightness, by the way: commits found in Android 10\u2019s source code by XDA Developers say it\u2019s because you would have seen the screen flicker as the refresh rate changes. Here\u2019s a more technical explanation from one of the commits:\n\nThe display uses different gamma curves for different refresh rates. It\u2019s hard for panel vendor to tune the curves to have exact same brightness for different refresh rate. So flicker could be observed at switch time. The issue is worse at the gamma lower end. In addition, human eyes are more sensitive to the flicker at darker environment. To prevent flicker, we only support higher refresh rates if the display brightness is above a threshold. And the darker environment could have higher threshold.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that Google follows through with its software updates and finds a way to let you use Smooth Display at lower brightness levels \u2014 and, maybe someday, let the apps that are apparently locked at 60Hz take full advantage of the 90Hz screen in a battery-friendly way.", "description": "Google apparently won\u2019t let Google Maps, Pokemon Go, Waze, and WeChat use the Pixel 4\u2019s \"Smooth Display\" feature to run at 90Hz, according to an explicit blacklist that XDA Developers\u2019 Mishaal Rahman and 9to5Google found in apparent source code for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z9Qk8R9xCmgH5PjmHwPGYggCMNE=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19298763/akrales_191017_3725_0118.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
