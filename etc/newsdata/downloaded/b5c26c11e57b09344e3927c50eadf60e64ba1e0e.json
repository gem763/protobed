Biden\u2019s still in charge for now,\u201d Mr. Ashworth says, noting that his own analysis of assorted polls finds the former vice president still has 30% voter support, particularly from black voters.\n\nNow comes a moment of truth.\n\nThe nation is due for a \u201cLabor Day campaign reset,\u201d Mr. Ashworth predicts.\n\n\u201cAfter Labor Day, more Americans will be paying much closer attention to the 2020 presidential campaign. The Sept. 12 debate will, for some viewers, be the first time they take a serious look at the Democratic field and begin to form stronger opinions. The prior debates were watched by millions of viewers, sure, but being so early in the process, many voters were still keeping their minds open.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has winnowed down a list of 10 candidates who will take to the stage when the third prime-time debate airs on ABC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the smallest qualifying roster yet for a debate with 20 candidates still in the running,\u201d the network noted.\n\nMr. Ashworth predicts that the three-way race between Mr. Biden, plus Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernard Sanders will tighten, while melodrama erupts among the rest of the rivals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering campaign crazy season when the low-digit candidates must pull out the stops and give it one last-ditch effort to make an impact on the race before their fundraising runs out,\u201d Mr. Ashworth concludes.\n\nPONDERING THE LABOR SHORTAGE\n\nOur old friend \u201cDeep Woods\u201d \u2014 a longtime Washington Times reader who indeed lives in the far woods of the Northeast \u2014 offers a Labor Day observation on two seemingly unrelated issues: abortion and the U.S. work force. There\u2019s a correlation, he says.\n\n\u201cAs the summer winds down here in the north country, I have been reading of and listening to the lamentations of the open border, Chamber of Commerce types \u2014 who are wishing for more workers to show up and claim all the unfilled jobs around the nation. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we had an additional 15,000,000 educated, tax paying, English speaking U.S. citizens? That\u2019s what they say,\u201d Mr. Woods tells Inside the Beltway.\n\n\u201cIt occurred to me that we did \u2014 and we killed them,\u201d he declares.\n\n\u201cIn the 50 years since Roe v. Wade we aborted the lives of 50 million babies. Today about 30,000,000 would be working age, and with a labor participation rate of 60%, about 15,000,000 could have been productive taxpayers in our economy. The unintended \u2014 or intended \u2014 consequences of abortion on demand. Just saying,\u201d Mr. Woods observes.\n\nPATRICK PIZZELLA\u2019S SUMMATION\n\nOn the nation\u2019s 125th Labor Day, acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella has positive numbers that counter endless news coverage that masks economic gains made by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cOn this Labor Day, more than 157 million Americans are working \u2014 the highest number of Americans working ever recorded. 5.7 million jobs have been created since January 2017. Unemployment is at 3.7%, near a 50-year low, and has been at or below 4% for 17 months in a row. This is the lowest unemployment going into a Labor Day since 1969. Year-over-year earnings growth has been at or above 3% for a year straight and is currently 3.2%. There are 7.3 million open jobs and there have been more open jobs than job seekers for 16 straight months,\u201d says Mr. Pizzella.\n\nWHAT THE EMPLOYEES SAY\n\nA nationwide survey of 2,000 U.S. workers reveals they\u2019re feeling better about their jobs than they have in years. So says The Conference Board, which conducted the poll. It found that 54% of workers are satisfied with their employment \u2014 up 3 percentage points from similar research conducted in 2018.\n\n\u201cThat marks a near-record increase in the survey\u2019s history. Workers also report being much more at ease about their job security. Millennials have experienced a surge in confidence regarding their wages,\u201d the polls analysis said.\n\n\u201cThe results, however, include some cautionary signs for management. Amid a strong jobs market where individuals can more easily find new work, survey participants gave weak marks to the most important driver of job satisfaction: their current job\u2019s potential for future growth. In addition, over 60% feel dissatisfied with their organization\u2019s recognition practices, performance review process, and communication channels. Also noteworthy, men generally feel better than women about multiple financial components of their work, including wages and bonus plans.\u201d\n\nLABOR DAY LIBATION\n\nA cocktail, perhaps, for those reluctant to bid goodbye to summer. Behold, the Grilled Peach Cocktail. The recipe is courtesy of Wishfulchef.com.\n\nIngredients: 4 peach wedges, a small amount of olive oil, 2 teaspoons sugar, 2 sprigs fresh thyme, 2 dashes of Angostura bitters, 2 teaspoons Meyer lemon juice, 2 ounces bourbon.\n\nLightly brush olive oil on the cut sides of the peach wedges. Grill all the peach wedges on their sides until charred. Muddle two grilled peach wedges, sugar, thyme, Angostura bitters, Meyer lemon juice and bourbon in a cocktail shaker. Pour into cold, ice-filled glasses. Garnish with remaining peach wedges and thyme sprigs. Yield: two servings.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 10% of full- and part-time U.S. workers belong to a union.\n\n\u2022 Of that percentage, 37% of government workers belong to a union.\n\n\u2022 14% of workers with an annual income of $100,000 or more are members of a union.\n\n\u2022 11% of Republicans, 8% of independents and 15% of Democrats are union members.\n\n\u2022 6% of private sector employees are union, as are 3% of those earning under $40,000 per year.\n\nSource: A Gallup poll of 1,294 employed U.S. adults conducted Aug. 1-14 and released Friday.\n\n\u2022 Have a productive Labor Day, and thanks for reading Inside the Beltway.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
