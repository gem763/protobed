Bush painted John Boehner\u2019s portrait", "language": "en", "text": "When former House speaker John A. Boehner retired from Congress, he was gifted a portrait painted by a very famous artist: former president George W. Bush.\n\nBoehner revealed his likeness in an interview with Barstool Sports; podcast host Uncle Chaps tweeted out an image of the painting on Friday.\n\nMe and @katebarstool interviewed John Boehner yesterday. He let us see something that no one else had before. When he was leaving the position of Speaker of the House, he asked President George W Bush to paint his official portrait. Here it is pic.twitter.com/34T0PwjTdZ \u2014 chaps (@UncleChaps) September 13, 2019\n\nA Boehner spokesman confirmed the painting was a parting gift from the former president. It will not, however, be the official portrait hanging in the Speaker\u2019s Lobby.\n\nBush took up painting as a post-presidency hobby and first exhibited his portraits of world leaders, including one of a pursed-lipped Russian President Vladimir Putin. In 2017, he released a book called \u201cPortraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief\u2019s Tribute to America\u2019s Warriors,\u201d which was a tribute to the servicemen and women who served after 9/11.\n\nBoehner and Bush remain close in retirement. In a 2017 interview with Politico Magazine, Boehner referred to them as \u201ctwo peas in the same pod,\u201d noting how they both approached their stressful jobs with a similar easygoing manner.\n\nKate Mannion of Barstool Sports added a fun anecdote that Bush had originally painted Boehner with white hair. She tweeted that Boehner texted him something along the lines of \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d\n\nA few hours later, Bush sent an updated salt-and-pepper version.", "description": "Boehner revealed his likeness in an interview with Barstool Sports.", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uGlqg4kITpfAAhiQWa_SCm_iCF0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZL4DLPR5W4I6RFK3PUXBTN4ZMY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
