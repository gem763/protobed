Called the American Idea Foundation, the group\u2019s stated goal is to \u201cfight poverty, increase economic opportunity, and advance evidence based public policies\u201d, which the press release claims were the cornerstone values of Paul Ryan\u2019s political career.\n\nI recall Paul Ryan\u2019s congressional tenure quite differently.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn the 20 years Ryan spent in Congress, he championed plans, policies, and programs that actively disenfranchised poor people, including reducing and restricting safety net programs.\n\nAfter a literal \u201cpoverty tour\u201d in 2014, he still moved to cut access to food stamps. He and other Republicans attempted to cut access to healthcare via Medicare and Medicaid for thousands of poor and elderly Americans. Ryan also had a horrible record on gay civil rights, opposing gay adoption and voting \u2018yes\u2019 on a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. He voted to ban federal healthcare coverage that included abortion provision.\n\nNow, struggling working class people are supposed to look to Paul Ryan and the American Idea Foundation to privately help undo the damage he, as a legislator, helped cause? I certainly wouldn\u2019t trust that.\n\nPaul Ryan is not the hero he thinks himself to be. From including primarily black people in his non-profit launch ad, which is in no way an accurate representation of poverty in West Virginia, to taking food off the table of poor families, he reads more like a bad, slightly racist cartoon villain preventing good citizens from accessing food, healthcare, and safety. Indeed, people have never really liked Paul Ryan, as evidenced by low favorability ratings throughout his career.\n\nWhat Paul Ryan, the Republicans, and those who support them fail to understand is that people who cannot afford education, healthcare, or safe housing have no potential for what he refers to as \u201ceconomic opportunity\u201d. You cannot pull yourself up by your bootstraps when you have no boots.\n\nRyan wants to maintain our broken system of capitalism instead of overhauling it, knowing that under American capitalism poverty, homelessness, and healthcare inaccessibility will continue to be an issue. His non-profit is a band-aid solution to a problem caused by his past economic policymaking.\n\nA recent YouGov poll recently found that nearly half of all millennials and Gen-Z\u2019ers have an unfavorable view of capitalism. The same poll found that 7 out of 10 millennials would consider voting for a socialist.\n\nIf you\u2019ve struggled to understand why Bernie Sanders, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the rest of \u201cThe Squad\u201d appeal to young people, it\u2019s because millennials are spending all their money on rent, can\u2019t afford routine healthcare, and are drowning in student debt. Many young people are trapped in a capitalist system that doesn\u2019t feel sustainable, and democratic socialism offers a way out of that cycle.\n\nRyan may well believe that his American Ideas Foundation is going to help people get back on their feet, and I don\u2019t doubt it will help some people. But at the same time, if his nonprofit upholds Republican values and rejects the growing trend of democratic socialism, it will continue to support the system that creates the very economic inequality that Ryan claims to reject.\n\nWe tried the Republican way, and all that we saw were shrinking safety nets for those who needed them. Instead of private help, working class people would sooner vote for their interests: accessible healthcare, housing, and education. Only one plan addresses the root issue of poverty, and it's not the one that promises \u201ceconomic opportunity\u201d over genuine equity.", "description": "This week, Paul Ryan announced a new non-profit initiative.
