Deals where those investors end up with more than their real demand often trade poorly to begin with or have to be canceled as they are not allocable.\n\nInvestors have been wary of the impact of the trade war on the consumer sector, with Chinese consumers scaling back purchases on everything from smartphones to furniture, as income growth slows and debt levels creep higher.\n\n\"The company has been trying to sell a story about U.S.-China synergy, but several investors are concerned that trade tensions would weigh on its business prospects in both countries,\" said one of the sources. \"Even at the low end, the deal is still not appealing enough.\"\n\nThe marketed price range represented a multiple of 11.5-15 times JS Global's forecast 2020 earnings, said sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak on the matter.\n\nJS Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe IPO is the third sizable deal delayed in Hong Kong so far this year.\n\nAB InBev, the world's largest beer maker, pulled an IPO of its Asia-Pacific unit <1876.HK> in July but then last month floated the business in the city's biggest listing this year.\n\nESR Cayman Ltd <1821.HK>, a logistics real estate developer, which also canceled a deal worth up to $1.24 billion in June, on Monday relaunched a bigger Hong Kong IPO.\n\nMorgan Stanley is the co-sponsor of both JS Global and AB InBev Asia offerings. The bank is also leading the ESR float in its second listing attempt.\n\nBacked by Chinese private-equity firm CDH Investments, JS Global posted a net profit of $112 million last year, down 20% from a year earlier.\n\nCredit Suisse and ICBC International are the other two joint sponsors of the IPO.\n\nNone of the co-sponsors immediately responded to a request for comment on the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Julie Zhu; Editing by Stephen Coates and Alison Williams)", "description": "Household appliances maker JS Global Lifestyle Company Ltd  pulled its initial public offering of up to HK$3.62 billion ($464 million) on Saturday, the third float delayed in Hong Kong so far this year, two sources told Reuters.
