In a statement to Deadline, a Weinstein representative questioned Paltrow\u2019s claim of \u201cher job being at stake\u201d. \u201cGwyneth Paltrow comes from Hollywood royalty \u2026 Her father was a top producer, her mother a famous actor, her godfather is Steven Spielberg. She didn\u2019t need to make movies with Harvey Weinstein; she wanted to, and she won top awards and was the top paid female actor for nearly a decade, with Weinstein \u2026 Her narrative of her job being at stake is just gratuitous.\u201d\n\nKantor and Twohey also describe the activities of high-profile lawyer Lisa Bloom, who acted on Weinstein\u2019s behalf. A memo Bloom wrote in 2016 is quoted in the book. Bloom\u2019s memo outlined a plan to undermine allegations by Rose McGowan, citing her experience as a victims\u2019 representative, saying: \u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them \u2026 We can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she\u2019s discredited.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Variety, McGowan said: \u201cWhat these people have done to my standing in the world has been systematic \u2013 it\u2019s been evil \u2026 It\u2019s one of the worst cases of gaslighting I\u2019ve ever heard, and it\u2019s starring me.\n\n\u201cHer email is staggering. Staggering! This woman should never work again. Lisa Bloom should be disbarred.\u201d\n\nBloom apologised on social media, writing: \u201cWhile painful, I learn so much more from my mistakes than my successes. To those who missed my 2017 apology, and especially to the women: I am sorry.\u201d", "description": "A new book says the actor was scared of going on the record at first but then encouraged other women to speak out", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b55b38305a1bf327292e2e133d6ac93394787885/1037_38_2472_1483/master/2472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6cc09b2923ece6dd1164094617295aab", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
