His feet are strapped in but he can deliver power to his legs to ride and to steer and ... it\u2019s bloody amazing!\u201d\n\nEver the scientist, however, Alan cautions that much work lies ahead if progress is to be made in benefiting other people with spinal cord injuries. \u201cWhile the patient in Poland is a very good achievement, it\u2019s scientifically the conservative to say, \u2018Well that\u2019s one example. Give me some more examples,\u2019\u201d says Alan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s three years since he had the injury and the odds are that this is because he had these cells put in his spinal cord rather than some other effect but, you know, yes \u2014 you really need to repeat it to show that it\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Mackay-Sim led the world\u2019s first clinical trial using stem cells to treat spinal cord injury.\n\nAlthough retired, Alan remains emeritus professor at Griffith University and lists repeating the success that was had in Poland as one of his major goals. \u201cWe have a team whose intentions are to move the clinical trials forward,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m chair of a scientific advisory board for that so that\u2019s one goal \u2014 to see the next phase of clinical trials.\n\n\u201cMy other goal is to progress our clinical trials in a drug that we\u2019ve found for a disease called hereditary spastic paraplegia. We\u2019ve got a drug that we\u2019re going to take to clinics to phase one clinical trials, for safety trials. My goal would be to take that through to phase two, which is the efficacy trial, and to get that drug into the population.\u201d\n\nToday, Alan is acknowledged as having laid the foundation for the next generation of researchers in his field and says the future of medical science is immensely exciting.\n\n\u201cI started my university degree in 1970,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that time our understanding of neuroscience has multiplied 1000 times over. And with the technologies that are available, and with our application of all sorts of chemistries; all sorts of computing techniques, all sorts of machinery and instruments, technologies like the genome, the stem-cell technologies \u2014 these are all huge developments.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to be around and if we can afford the science I can definitely say can there\u2019s a rosy future for humanity ahead.\u201d\n\nCommBank have been proud partners of Australian of the Year Awards for over 37 years, celebrating and championing those who make our country a better place.
