(Either that or you really don\u2019t follow the news very closely at all.) In addition to that, smart devices with cameras installed are probably recording videos and pictures of you when you don\u2019t expect them to. But those are generally just instances of the people who make the devices looking for information to use when pitching ads to you. (Hopefully.)\n\nAs it turns out, however, hackers are able to come after you using the same systems by creating apps and hiding malware in them. As Ars Technica reports this week, developers were able to sneak apps into the app stores that were capable of recording your activities if you installed them on your devices. Isn\u2019t that just wonderful?\n\nThe threat isn\u2019t just theoretical. Whitehat hackers at Germany\u2019s Security Research Labs developed eight apps\u2014four Alexa \u201cskills\u201d and four Google Home \u201cactions\u201d\u2014that all passed Amazon or Google security-vetting processes. The skills or actions posed as simple apps for checking horoscopes, with the exception of one, which masqueraded as a random-number generator. Behind the scenes, these \u201csmart spies,\u201d as the researchers call them, surreptitiously eavesdropped on users and phished for their passwords. \u201cIt was always clear that those voice assistants have privacy implications\u2014with Google and Amazon receiving your speech, and this possibly being triggered on accident sometimes,\u201d Fabian Br\u00e4unlein, senior security consultant at SRLabs, told me. \u201cWe now show that, not only the manufacturers, but\u2026 also hackers can abuse those voice assistants to intrude on someone\u2019s privacy.\u201d\n\nThe details of what the whitehat hackers were able to do are disturbing, to say the least. They developed a series of apps for both Amazon and Google with malicious code hidden in them and were able to get all of them into the store and available to the public. This calls the companies\u2019 vetting processes into question at a minimum.\n\nIn one example, an app performed the seemingly harmless service of generating a random number for the user. Another provided your \u201clucky horoscope\u201d on any given day. Both of these apps appeared to function normally and then indicated that the process was complete and shut down. But the device was still listening, recording everything else said in the room and sending a transcript to the hacker\u2019s server.\n\nIn another example, an app appeared to fail to perform and \u201cshut down.\u201d But then in a fake voice sounding like the digital assistant, it announced that an update was available and asked for the user to say or enter their password. That too was sent to the hacker\u2019s server.\n\nCheck out this short video of one of the apps in action.\n\nThe linked article contains a detailed explanation of how these malicious apps pull off these tricks if you\u2019re interested in that sort of thing. But the point is that the intruders conducting this test were easily able to do it (in multiple languages) and get the malware accepted into the online stores every time.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to do with this information aside from only downloading apps from trusted sources. But who\u2019s a trusted source these days when even Amazon and Google have employees listening in on your activities. I have Cortana on my laptop because it came with that, but I\u2019ve never enabled it. I also have the \u201cokay Google\u201d function on my phone that I use sometimes, but I don\u2019t use all that many apps. This is apparently just one more risk you take every time you step out onto the information superhighway I guess.", "description": "They're listening", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Alexa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
