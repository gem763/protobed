He has paid off his mortgage and just came back from a two-week road-trip across America. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I can basically go where I want and not worry about the financials of it,\u201d Wane told MarketWatch. \u201cTwo years ago, I couldn\u2019t afford a taxi.\u201d\n\nWhat changed? Wane started an e-commerce business and used drop shipping \u2014 a practice in which a retailer keeps no inventory and a third-party supplier sends consumers the products \u2014 to handle orders.\n\n\u201cI heard about drop-shipping a couple of years ago, and I wanted to try it,\u201d Wane said. \u201cI really just wanted an extra 200 pounds a month to help pay the bills and maybe save up for a holiday.\u201d\n\nHe soon became a lot more successful than he originally envisioned. \u201cMy first five stores failed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my sixth store that really took off,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t want to reveal the name of the website but describes it as a \u201cgeneral store\u201d \u2014 think Amazon AMZN, -0.17% but with far fewer products. He says he has sold everything from snow goggles and sunglasses to lamps and garden products. With the store, he\u2019s brought in over $700,000 in sales, and made a $125,000 profit.\n\nAnd Wane isn\u2019t alone. Hundreds of these drop-shipping entrepreneurs have made GOOG, -0.68% GOOGL, -0.74% videos boasting about the millions of dollars they\u2019ve made from their businesses.\n\nMany, Wane included, offer courses that they promise will teach you how you can also make thousands selling products online without inventory. Part of the reason Wane chose not to reveal the name of his store to MarketWatch is that he didn\u2019t want to share the secrets of a successful drop shipping business with those who haven\u2019t paid for his $397 academy.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWane uses Shopify SHOP, -0.17% to sell his products. It costs $29 each month and allows individuals to build a website they can use to sell their products. Some e-commerce alternatives to Shopify include BigCommerce, whose standard monthly plans cost $29.95, and Volusion, which will set you back anywhere from $15 to $135 a month, depending on your plan.\n\nSellers build a website with the platform and find products to add to that website. These products typically come from Chinese retail services like AliExpress.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an app called Oberlo, which allows you to add products from AliExpress to your Shopify website,\u201d Wane said. \u201cYou basically find products, import them to your store, change the description so that they look more professional, and change the price.\u201d\n\nHow do you reach consumers once you have a website full of products? \u201cFacebook FB, -0.51% ads,\u201d Wane said.\n\nThat\u2019s the major hurdle for most people who want to get into \u201cdrop-shipping,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any inventory, so there\u2019s no cost there. You just have to pay $29 for a Shopify account and maybe $10 for a domain name. The first big cost is Facebook ads.\u201d\n\nIf your ads are successful and people choose to order your products, they will be sent directly from the supplier. \u201cYou don\u2019t pay for anything until a customer pays you,\u201d Wane explained. \u201cSay you\u2019re selling a product for $30 and it costs $10 from the supplier \u2014 you take $10 and pay the supplier for it. No bulk buys or anything like that. And then you get the supplier to ship it anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nThe downside: His business has a 2.59% customer return rate, according to his Shopify analytics Wane shared with MarketWatch.\n\n\u201cThe seller is just an intermediary or a middle man,\u201d Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon, told MarketWatch. \u201cThey never need to see the products they\u2019re selling.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is successful\n\nWane predicts the majority of people who open online drop-shipping businesses don\u2019t make a lot of money.\n\nThere are a few reasons they aren\u2019t successful, according to Wane. For one, they could be selling the wrong products. \u201cI look at trends, and I look at demand in products,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cThere was a high demand for sunglasses, especially in the UK because we had a really hot July.\u201d\n\nAnother reason: A poorly designed website. \u201cThe website is the brand,\u201d Wane says. \u201cPeople trust me because of my brand in the same way people trust Amazon. If your website looks unprofessional, people won\u2019t trust you.\u201d\n\nBut the most important factor is Facebook. \u201cMy first five stores failed because I didn\u2019t know how to use Facebook ads correctly. Facebook has so much information on you \u2014 the ads can be very specific and targeted. But if you\u2019re spending $1,000 on Facebook ads and targeting the wrong group of people, you won\u2019t make any sales.\u201d\n\nMany say it\u2019s a form of online trickery\n\nMost consumers first see these drop-shipped, Chinese products being advertised on social media sites like Facebook. And many who have bought them feel like they\u2019ve been tricked.\n\nAna Carlson, who lives in Los Angeles and runs a plant-decor store online, says her mom has been deceived twice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really noticed these ads on Facebook because I simply tune them out. They look sketchy to me,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cBut a lot of older people like my mom don\u2019t think they look shady.\u201d\n\nCarlson\u2019s mom first bought a dress from one of these drop-shipping sites, and it turned out to be far smaller than she had expected. She had trouble getting in contact with the site\u2019s customer service and decided to give the dress away.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell her daughter about the situation until she was fooled again. \u201cShe ordered a bra from one of these sites. When it arrived, it was so small that it would not fit any adult,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nThis time, Carlson looked at the site. \u201cThey were selling all sorts of things. It was a very messy and spammy looking site,\u201d she remembers. Eventually, she found an email and tried to contact customer service. The site responded with a message saying they didn\u2019t have a refund policy. Carlson\u2019s mom eventually received a refund on the bra from her credit-card company, but she never got any money back on the dress.\n\nThe same happened to John Frigo, who has run e-commerce stores in the past selling nutrient supplements. \u201cThe last item I bought that was clearly drop-shipped was a camping backpack,\u201d Frigo told MarketWatch. \u201cI saw it on Instagram, and it was advertised as high quality and super durable.\u201d\n\nAfter taking five weeks to arrive, the backpack turned out to be \u201csuper thin and flimsy,\u201d Frigo said. \u201cAnd the zipper broke within two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people who sell the products have never seen them,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in serving customers. They just want to make a quick buck.\u201d\n\nWane says he vets all of his suppliers and the products they produce before he advertises them. Only about 1 to 2% of his customers try to return their orders, he estimated. He first offers these customers a 15% discount. If they\u2019re still set on returning the product, he asks them to ship it to him and he refunds the order completely.\n\nWane doesn\u2019t mind the critics.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say you\u2019re just selling cheap Chinese products online,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the same products people are buying on Amazon, and people are quite happy buying them from there simply because they trust Amazon\u2019s name. But it\u2019s no different.\u201d\n\nAnd he emphasized that some of the products are good. \u201cWhen we had the heat wave in Europe, I started selling personal air conditioners. You find a product that solves problems for people, and you sell it \u2014 it won\u2019t sell well if it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Two years ago, I couldn\u2019t afford a taxi,\u2019 says independent online retailer Christopher Wane", "authors": ["James Wellemeyer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP582_Wane_ZG_20190815194342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
