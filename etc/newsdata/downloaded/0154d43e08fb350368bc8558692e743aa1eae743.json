It\u2019s a lesson that Coleen Rooney seems to have learned the hard way this week.\n\nShe announced in a scandalous post on Twitter that she had allegedly discovered who had been selling stories about her to The Sun newspaper based on information from her private Instagram posts.\n\nShe claimed that, by process of elimination, she thinks the culprit is her friend and fellow footballer\u2019s wife, Rebekah Vardy.\n\nThe sleuthing involved in this epic expose is incredible.\n\nIn the accusation \u2013 which Rebekah has since denied \u2013 Coleen says that she has \u2018saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nWhether the claim is true or not \u2013 what we can take away from this juicy mess of a situation is that friendships can be tough. And sometimes, people who you think have your back can be the first to stick a knife into it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us will, at some point, have experienced that hollow, sickening feeling of being betrayed by somebody close to you. And you don\u2019t have to be a celebrity with thousands of followers to know how much that hurts.\n\nWe asked people to tell us the stories of their worst friendship betrayals \u2013 including toxic jealousy, boyfriend stealing and all-round snakey behaviour. Strap in.\n\n\u2018Next thing I know, she comes back and tells me that my boyfriend kissed her\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nEmily* \u2013 \u2018She sold my story to a national paper for \u00a33,000\u2019\n\nI was seeing a minor celebrity for almost a year.\n\nI was getting calls from a couple of newspapers asking to \u2018clarify\u2019 my relationship with him. I didn\u2019t tell them anything and the guy I was seeing told me to ignore them but I was suspicious. Why would they care?\n\nSo I did some digging and finally found out that he was married by looking through his Instagram followers. I\u2019m rarely on Instagram so I genuinely had no idea.\n\nJulia*, a friend for 30-odd years, was dating someone who had a link with the ex-wife of the guy I had been seeing. And he convinced Julia to get evidence of our relationship.\n\nOne night she borrowed my phone, telling me she had run out of credit, and took screenshots of loads of text messages between the married guy and I. Some of them were very steamy\n\nShe sold the story to a national paper for \u00a33,000!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was accused by his wife of selling the story but I didn\u2019t.\n\nI lost my home, my job and was followed by reporters and made out to be a gold-digging, marriage-wrecking w****.\n\nIsobel* \u2013 \u2018She told me she had kissed my boyfriend\u2019\n\nI had been friends with Rosie* for about six months and I invited her to my boyfriend\u2019s birthday meal.\n\nShe got really drunk and was making conversation at the table but it was all of a sexual nature.\n\nMe and my other half were sat with her, trying to be friendly but also change the conversation.\n\nMy boyfriend then went to buy us all drinks and Lucy decided to follow him up to the bar and was chatting to him.\n\nNext thing I know, she comes back and tells me that my boyfriend kissed her! She said she felt really bad, but that he wanted to take her home and she didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nMy boyfriend then comes back to the table \u2013 completely unaware \u2013 and s*** hits the fan.\n\nThe next week at work she basically blanked me and starts bitching about me not being a good friend to everyone in the office!\n\n\u2018One night she borrowed my phone, telling me she had run out of credit, and took screenshots\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nFreddie \u2013 \u2018I would have taken a proverbial bullet for them\u2019\n\nThe male group of friends I made at uni were my closest mates, and I would have taken a proverbial bullet for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen my mental health issues came to a head and I finally had to address them, they were amazing with me, checked in on me regularly and made sure I was okay on nights out when I broke down or when I did CBT in final year when I was in a very dangerous mental state.\n\nA year after university, when we still saw each other once every so often for nights out and reunions, I suggested we all do a holiday together.\n\nI was renowned in the group for being the organiser, but I didn\u2019t want to be a keeno and put people off going, so I left it to them. But I always said \u2013 just let me know when things are sorted and I\u2019ll pay everything straight away.\n\nA few months went by and nothing seemed to progress. It seemed like the opportunity was lost, which I was a bit annoyed about as I had turned down another holiday with different friends to try and make it happen.\n\nIt transpired a few weeks later that, unbeknownst to me, all the group (except for one who refused to be involved) had created a separate group-chat and had \u2018debated\u2019 taking me on the holiday with them.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how long it had gone on for or how the conversations went.\n\nI was told that no decision could be reached so they put taking me to a vote, which went against me 3-2.\n\nI only found this out months after it happened and it crushed me, especially my mental health, as I didn\u2019t have any friends in secondary school and all the anxieties and paranoia I had back then about not fitting into groups came flooding back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI began to think; did they ever really like me in the first place? Was my personality so divisive and toxic that it needed to be debated whether I could be taken on a holiday?\n\nAt the start, I stayed in the original Whatsapp group as I felt too torn about leaving these friends I had thought were going to be life-long and always with me.\n\nNone of the boys reached out to me to apologise straight away or try to make an effort to make it up to me. Conversation in the groupchat just carried on as normal.\n\nEventually, I realised that even if I was to stay in the group, I could never trust them again, so I left the group.\n\nAt the time I had a range of emotions about it \u2013 sadness, anger, pain but now I just feel sorry and sad for them that they felt they had to do this and sacrificed my friendship for \u00a3600-800.\n\n\u2018They created a separate group-chat and had \u2018debated\u2019 taking me on the holiday\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nAleesha* \u2013 \u2018I don\u2019t know what she planned to do with the screenshots\u2019\n\nI come from a religiously conservative family (although my immediate family aren\u2019t as strict).\n\nOne of my cousins \u2013 who is a gossip queen \u2013 would stalk our social media profiles and screenshot pictures of us in \u2018revealing\u2019 clothes and keep them stored on her phone.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what she planned to do with them, but perhaps she was planning to spread them so she could have a gossip about how \u2018slutty\u2019 we were.\n\nAnyway, my sister came across pics of herself and promptly deleted them all.\n\nDana* \u2013 \u2018She was always jealous of me at school\u2019\n\nI was on a night out with a friend from school \u2013 Tasha*.\n\nShe always loves trying to belittle me \u2013 she was always jealous at school when we were younger if a guy fancied me and not her).\n\nOne of the guys who we met on the night out said to me (purely platonically) I was alright and that I was \u2018super funny\u2019, to which she immediately jumped in and replied; \u2018She\u2019s not funny at all, I\u2019m the funny one!\u2019\n\nJenny* \u2013 \u2018It felt worse than an actual heartbreak\u2019\n\nBella* was my best friend. We lived together for years, held wild parties, went on nights out and had movie marathons together.\n\nThe problems started when she moved out and I moved in with my boyfriend. Suddenly she didn\u2019t want to come over any more or hang out.\n\nI get that it can be tough hanging around with a couple if you\u2019re single \u2013 but my boyfriend and I were always very chill and I tried to make time to hang out with just her.\n\nI could feel that we were drifting slightly, but I still thought of her as my best friend. So when I was unwell and in a lot of pain \u2013 I called her, expecting her to come over and help me out \u2013 as I would have done for her.\n\nInstead, she made an excuse and didn\u2019t come and see me at all. When I called her out on it, she sent a string of awful messages on WhatsApp, screamed at me on the phone and then proceeded to blank me for an entire year.\n\nIt felt worse than an actual heartbreak. I tried so many times to reconcile and figure out what was going on \u2013 but ultimately I had to just leave it to protect myself from being hurt any more.\n\nEliza* \u2013 \u2018She had told the teachers that I was bullying her\u2019\n\nWhen I was 14, my year group was massive so they split us into two halves, and the separate halves never saw each other- separate breaks, lunches, lessons.\n\nLiterally all of my friends were put in the other half of the year, bar one girl, my best friend, who was in my class (I should add that my friends were also her friends, we were the nerdy, drama crew)\n\nIt was annoying, but at least we had each other.\n\nAt the beginning of the next school year, she\u2019d been moved to the other half as well. We had begged for both of us to be moved, together, so many times, but we were just told there was no space.\n\nSo I was like \u2013 how on Earth is she over there if there\u2019s no space?\n\nI was all by myself, and she was making better and better friends with our friendship group \u2013 I started to feel really excluded.\n\nI found out one day \u2013 because the head of year finally decided to talk to me about it \u2013 that she had told the teachers that I was bullying her so they had to move her!\n\nI was categorically not bullying her, she was my best friend.\n\nAbsolutely no one believed me that she was lying, even my godmother \u2013 who was a mutual friend of my mum and her mum. They said things like; \u2018they\u2019re teenage girls, they\u2019re both as bad as each other\u2019.\n\nIt affected our parents\u2019 whole friendship group as they were mates too.\n\nI even ended up moving schools because I just felt so alone.\n\nEventually, it came out that she was a compulsive liar \u2013 she had been ringing another friend up and telling her that her dad was abusing her and that her step mum had cancer, none of which was true.\n\nSo finally, everything came out.\n\nFaye* \u2013 \u2018She didn\u2019t say anything, she didn\u2019t defend me\u2019\n\nMy best friend at the time Alice* was dating this guy \u2013 we were at a festival and she had an argument with him. I had jumped in to defend her and he had a go at me.\n\nHe was awful, he called me a c***, he said that I was a privileged idiot and had no right to talk to him. He was horrific to me, basically.\n\nShe just sat there silently, she didn\u2019t say anything, she didn\u2019t defend me.\n\nThen, a few months later, on New Year\u2019s Eve we went out to a club in town. I was meant to be staying at her house that night. It turns out, that awful guy she was seeing was working at the bar we were going to \u2013 which she knew but didn\u2019t tell me.\n\nSo really, what we were doing was going to meet him, because she stayed with him.\n\nShe then dropped it on me that the plan was we were all going to stay at his house that night \u2013 we had such a huge fight about it and she went off and stayed with him, and left me.\n\nSo she essentially made me get a ridiculously expensive taxi all the way home, because I wasn\u2019t about to stay at that guy\u2019s house.\n\nElla* \u2013 \u2018I noticed how toxic and obsessive she was becoming\u2019\n\nRia* and I were best friends for six years and at this time I started seeing my now ex-boyfriend Jack*.\n\nShe was strangely jealous of us from the start and would ask me odd personal questions about our relationship and beg me to go into detail about our sex life.\n\nOne evening she even followed Jack and I home after a big night out (she wasn\u2019t invited \u2013 we ran into her at a bar).\n\nI feel like she purposely inserted herself into this scenario and wanted to basically find a way to sleep with Jack, even if that meant I was in the picture. I got this weird feeling so I made sure I called her an Uber home.\n\nI found her behaviour so strange that night because she was so desperate for the attention of my boyfriend.\n\nLater down the line, I cut our friendship off because I noticed how toxic and obsessive she was becoming.\n\nI also found out after I broke up with Jack that they had hooked up and made it known to our social circle so that it would most definitely get back to me.\n\nI even had mutual acquaintances reveal to me that she had slept with several of my ex-boyfriends over the course of our six-year friendship. Guess we shared more than I realised.\n\n*These names have been changed.\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Don\u2019t tell me to pick a side \u2013 I am mixed-race, so I am both\u2019\n\nMORE: Biker stops wedding car and begs his ex not to get married\n\nMORE: How to celebrate Dia de los Muertos without culturally appropriating\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The saga with Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy tells us one thing - friendships are hard.
