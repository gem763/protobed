Photo: DigitalGlobe\n\nAn attack on key oil installations in Saudi Arabia on Saturday has prompted fears of a major disruption in the world oil market and a wider geopolitical conflict in the Gulf. It was the most significant strike on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure \u2014 or any part of the global energy infrastructure \u2014 since the Gulf War nearly three decades ago. Though Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, the Trump administration is insisting that Iran is responsible, raising the spectre of U.S. military retaliation.\n\nMuch remains unclear about the attack and what might happen next. Below is what we know so far.\n\nThe attack and damage\n\nAccording to Saudi officials, a predawn barrage of \u201cprojectiles\u201d struck the Abqaiq oil-processing plant and the Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province on Saturday morning. Both are important facilities operated by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant that is the world\u2019s largest oil producer, but Abqaiq \u2014 the largest oil-processing plant in the world \u2014 is especially critical to the country\u2019s oil infrastructure.\n\nThe strikes triggered large fires at Abqaiq and Khurais. There are no reports of injuries to Saudi Aramco personnel, but the extent of the damage still wasn\u2019t clear as of Monday morning.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0641\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0623\u062a\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0628\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0629. pic.twitter.com/nOC5Yh0Jkr \u2014 \u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0623\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0631 (@QanatAhrar) September 14, 2019\n\nWho is responsible?\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebel group, which has been fighting Yemeni-government forces and their Saudi backers since 2015, claimed responsibility for the strikes on Saturday. On a television channel run by the group, a military spokesperson bragged of a \u201clarge-scale\u201d operation using ten explosive-laden drones to attack the facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais. A spokesperson called the attack a \u201clegitimate and natural\u201d retaliation against Saudi aggression in Yemen.\n\nThough the Houthis have previously carried out drone and short-range-ballistic-missile attacks on targets inside Saudi Arabia, there have been doubts that the group is capable of conducting such a precise and destructive operation so deep within Saudi territory \u2014 and there have been unconfirmed reports that missiles, not drones, were used in the attack, as well as unconfirmed reports that the strikes were launched from Iraq.\n\nThe level of sophistication shown in the attack is one reason U.S. officials are saying Iran, and not the Houthis, is responsible. Retired colonel Cedric Leighton, speaking to CNN, explained: \u201cThe precise nature of the intelligence used to conduct targeting, the mission planning that went into this to avoid radar detection, as well as the selection of the targets shows a robust capability that would most likely be the work of a government or government-sponsored group.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Trump-administration officials released satellite images of the attack in an attempt to further implicate Iran. The images, they said, show points of impact on the north and northwest sides of of the Saudi oil facilities. That suggests that the attacks originated from Iran or Iraq and not Yemen, which is to Saudi Arabia\u2019s south. \u201cIt is very difficult to see how these things could have come from anywhere\u201d else, an administration official told CNN.\n\nLOOK: The U.S. government released satellite images showing the surgical strike against the Saudi oil facility of Abqaiq pic.twitter.com/pHe3JXaTHV \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) September 16, 2019\n\nThe Saudis, unlike the U.S., haven\u2019t settled on Iran as the culprit in Saturday\u2019s attack. But the Saudi military is saying the attack was not launched from Yemen and, according to an early investigation, was carried out with Iranian weapons.\n\nIran has rejected the accusations that it carried out the attack. \u201cHaving failed at \u2018max pressure,\u2019 [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is] turning to \u2018max deceit,\u2019\u201d Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted Sunday.\n\nOne military commander has also issued a thinly veiled threat to the U.S. \u201cEverybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d said Amirali Hajizadeh of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps Aerospace Force.\n\nMeanwhile, Houthi rebels in Yemen insist they were behind the attacks and have warned that more may be coming. Per the New York Times, the Houthi news organization reported Monday that a military spokesperson \u201cwarned companies and foreigners not to be present in the factories that were hit by our strikes because we may target them again at any moment.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. response\n\nTrump pledges support and threatens Iran\n\nA White House spokesperson announced on Saturday that President Trump had called Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, the notorious Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to offer America\u2019s support following the attack. The statement also emphasized that the U.S. remained \u201ccommitted to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied.\u201d\n\nPompeo blames Iran\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, swiftly blamed Iran for the strikes. In a tweeted statement, the longtime Iran hawk accused the Islamic Republic of launching \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d and insisted there was \u201cno evidence the attacks came from Yemen\u201d \u2014 though he didn\u2019t provide any evidence to the contrary. Pompeo also sought to discredit the regime\u2019s peacemaking efforts, contending that \u201cTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while [Iranian president Hassan] Rouhani and [foreign minister Mohammad Javad] Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy.\u201d\n\nGraham urges U.S. strikes on Iran\n\nFellow Iran hawk and GOP senator Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, made it clear that he saw the attack as an opportunity to justify a U.S. military strike on Iran. \u201cIt is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment,\u201d Graham wrote on Twitter. The regime in Tehran \u201cwill not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president and his administration have remained steadfast in their support for bin Salman, the Saudi regime, and its brutal intervention in Yemen\u2019s civil war, despite growing opposition among U.S. lawmakers and allies, which reached a tipping point after Trump shrugged off the gruesome assassination of Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey last year.\n\nTrump\u2019s threats of war and the congressional response\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump began to escalate the rhetoric, tweeting that the U.S. has \u201creason to believe we know\u201d the source of the attack and that forces are \u201clocked and loaded\u201d once that source is verified by the Saudis.\n\nSaudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. is waiting on orders from Riyadh drew condemnation from many Democrats and at least one (former) Republican.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump, the Constitution of the United States is perfectly clear,\u201d Bernie Sanders tweeted. \u201cOnly Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 can declare war. And Congress will not give you the authority to start another disastrous war in the Middle East just because the brutal Saudi dictatorship told you to.\u201d Connecticut senator Chris Murphy tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s simply amazing how the Saudis call all our shots these days.\u201d And Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic candidate for president, tweeted: \u201cTrump awaits instructions from his Saudi masters. Having our country act as Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitch is not \u2018America First.\u2019\u201d\n\nFormer Republican congressman Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party, tweeted, \u201cUnder our Constitution, the power to commence war lies with Congress, not the president and certainly not Saudi Arabia. We don\u2019t take orders from foreign powers.\u201d\n\nThe impact on Saudi oil production and the world oil market\n\nSaturday\u2019s attacks struck the very heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure. The country produces 10 percent of the world\u2019s oil supplies, and Saudi Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq facility is the largest crude-oil-processing plant in the world and critical to the country\u2019s production capabilities. On average, Saudi Arabia exports roughly 7.4 million barrels of oil per day, and after the attack, Saudi Aramco officials announced that they would be forced to reduce that output by 5.7 million barrels because of the damage to Abqaiq. That means a single strike was able to knock out roughly 5 percent of the world\u2019s oil supply.\n\nSaudi officials have claimed that the disruption will not last long and that they could recover a third of the lost output by as early as Monday, but some energy-sector experts have speculated that it could take weeks for the country to recover full capacity. \u201cThis could take a longer time than the authorities initially are claiming,\u201d oil-market analyst Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen explained on Sunday. \u201cSaudi Arabia has also depleted its crude-oil stocks to the lowest levels in ten years, so the country alone does not have the same robustness to Middle East interruptions as it used to have,\u201d he added.\n\nOil futures in the United States, meanwhile, responded with the largest one-day price jump in almost four years, with the cost of a barrel of West Texas crude growing by 10 percent. While gas prices could to spike in the aftermath of the attack, the U.S. economy is expected to emerge from this episode unscathed. On Sunday night, President Trump announced the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \u201cto keep the markets well supplied.\u201d The last time the SPR was tapped was after a supply disruption following violence in Libya.\n\nOther variables remain. As MarketWatch noted, \u201cThe threat of further escalation involving the U.S. also holds the potential to drive crude prices higher still.\u201d As of early Monday morning, oil prices were at their highest levels since May. Tom Kloza, a chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, told CNN that the drone strike is \u201cthe biggest shock to the oil markets since [Hurricane] Katrina. And like Katrina it will likely haunt us for months, at least weeks.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe most significant response to Saturday\u2019s strikes would be a retaliatory attack on Iran by the U.S. While Trump\u2019s tweets indicate that he\u2019s ready to give the go-ahead, the minor issue of congressional authorization stands in the way.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is no congressional authorization for US military retaliation on behalf of Saudi Arabia, no treaty that calls for it, and no reason to think escalating the conflict by having a superpower intervene directly would do anything positive for anyone. \u2014 southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) September 16, 2019\n\nNext week, both Trump and Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani will be at the United Nations General Assembly meeting. The U.S. has previously said the two leaders could meet on the sidelines, but now Iran says that won\u2019t happen. \u201cNeither is such an event on our agenda, nor will it happen. Such a meeting will not take place,\u201d Abbas Mousavi, Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, said Monday. He added that if the U.S. \u201cstops economic terrorism and returns to the nuclear deal, then they may sit at a corner and be present within the framework of the nuclear deal member states.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration blames Iran, which is denying any role in the air strikes that have had a major impact on oil markets.", "authors": ["Chas Danner", "Adam K.
