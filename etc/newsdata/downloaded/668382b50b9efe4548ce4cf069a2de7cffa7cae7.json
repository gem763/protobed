REUTERS/Staff/File Photo\n\nMSCI\u2019s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.2%. The Euro STOXX 600 added 0.4%.\n\nThe positive mood in Europe mirrored gains in Asia. There, MSCI's widest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.3%, with Chinese shares .CSI300 gaining 0.3%.\n\nAppetite for riskier assets was also supported as markets judged the chances of a disruptive no-deal Brexit were receding, even after Britain\u2019s parliament delayed a vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s deal to exit the EU.\n\nJohnson will seek to put his Brexit deal to a vote on Monday, with the government proposing a debate on the agreement. Parliament was due to open at 1330 GMT.\n\nIt was unclear, though, whether parliament\u2019s speaker would allow a vote to go ahead. The decision should come around 1430 GMT, and any vote could come much later on Monday.\n\nInvestors in Asia earlier were boosted by comments on Friday by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He\u2019s comments that Beijing will collaborate with the United States to address mutual concerns on the trade war.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had also struck an optimistic tone on Friday, saying he thought a trade deal would be signed before an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Chile next month.\n\n\u201cThey seem to making progress,\u201d said Jeremy Gatto, an investment manager at Unigestion in Geneva. \u201cBut we have seen in the past that everything seems to look great and then a couple of days later seems to deteriorate again.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 U.S. presidential election was also influencing the talks, investors said, with Trump looking to avoid the possibility of tariffs imposed by China hurting his voters.\n\n\u201cTrump realizes that some of the tariffs that potentially could be implemented toward the end of the year could affect the consumer, which would be bad for the U.S. economy - and obviously bad for him,\u201d Gatto said.\n\nWall Street futures NQcv1EScv1 indicated gains of around 0.3%. U.S. markets are also gearing up for high-profile earnings reports this week from such companies as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively low bar for U.S. corporates to beat on earnings for this quarter,\u201d said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\nMarket players, he said, were watching out for how slower economic growth could affect companies\u2019 results.\n\n\u201cWhat will be most important for the market will be whether or not companies start to guide toward lower earnings expectations in the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nPOUND AT 5 1/2-MONTH PEAK\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 surged in early London trading to $1.301, recovering earlier losses of half a percent against the dollar.\n\nSterling had by Friday risen as much as 6.5% in seven trading days to a five-month high, underscoring market expectations that either a Brexit deal or delay was most likely. By late morning, it was trading at $1.2981.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it now sees the chance of a no-deal Brexit reduced to 5%, from 10% previously.\n\nStill, some investors said that sterling\u2019s medium-term prospects were limited, even if no deal is avoided.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too bullish, because there is still going to be a huge amount of uncertainty going forward, even if the current deal is agreed,\u201d said Tim Drayson, head of economics at Legal & General Investment Management.\n\n\u201cIf this deal does go through, ultimately it is still a relatively hard Brexit - we are out of the customs union - and it is still a deterioration in the UK terms of trade.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: A trader works as screens show market data at CMC markets in London, Britain, December 11, 2018.

The benchmark 10-year German government bond\u2019s yield rose as much as 4 basis points to -0.334% DE10YT=RR. Other yields from the euro zone core were also higher FR10YT=RR.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices held steady on Monday, recouping some early losses. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were down 62 cents, or 1%, to $58.80 a barrel by late morning.", "description": "World shares rose on Monday, as hopes for resolving the U.S.-China trade war and a belief that Britain will avoid a disorderly exit from the European Union gave investors cause for riskier bets.", "authors": ["Tom Wilson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443326358&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0TA", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
