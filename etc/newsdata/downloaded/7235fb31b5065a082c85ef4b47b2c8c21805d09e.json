To utter it during a breakup conversation is either a kind and helpful way to lessen the pain of parting or the cruelest part of the whole endeavor, depending on who you ask. An attempt to stay friends may be a kindness if it suggests an attachment or a respect that transcends the circumstances of the romantic relationship, for instance. It can be a cruelty, however, when it serves to pressure the jilted party into burying feelings of anger and hurt. And some would say that breaking someone\u2019s heart and then requesting the continued emotional investment that\u2019s inherent to an actual, functioning friendship is simply an unfair thing to do.\n\nAs a result, how to interpret or act on the suggestion of a post-breakup friendship is one of the great everyday mysteries of our time. Perhaps the emphasis there belongs on \u201cour time\u201d: Researchers and historians suspect that the impulse to stay friends, or the impulse to at least stay on good terms after a breakup, has developed only in the past few generations. As a recently common component of the eternally common practice of breaking up, \u201cI hope we can still be friends\u201d reveals truths about the modern state of both romance and friendship.\n\nThere are four main reasons, Rebecca Griffith and her colleagues found, why exes feel compelled to maintain a friendship or to suggest doing so: for civility (i.e., I want this breakup to hurt less than it will otherwise), for reasons relating to unresolved romantic desires (I want to see other people but keep you within reach in case I change my mind), for practicality (We work together/go to school together/share mutual friends, and thus we should stay on good terms to minimize drama), and for security (I trust you and want you to remain in my life as a confidant and supportive presence).\n\nTo some, perhaps, that will seem obvious; indeed, several of the results in Griffith\u2019s study, which was published in the research journal Personal Relationships, serve to confirm what many already know in a marrow-deep way to be true. For instance, Griffith and her team found that friendships resulting from unresolved romantic desires tended to lead to the most negative outcomes, like feelings of sadness, challenges moving on romantically, and disapproval from other friends. Friendships formed between exes for \u201csecurity,\u201d meanwhile, produced the most positive outcomes and the highest-quality friendships. (One surprising finding was that extroverted people were less likely to remain friends with an ex\u2013romantic partner. Because extroverts tend to make friends easily, this wasn\u2019t what Griffith and her team expected. \u201cBut maybe they\u2019re so good at becoming friends with people they don\u2019t need this [particular] friendship,\u201d she said.)", "description": "Is it a cruelty or a kindness to suggest friendship during a breakup?", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/StayFriendResize-1/facebook.jpg?1566221711", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
