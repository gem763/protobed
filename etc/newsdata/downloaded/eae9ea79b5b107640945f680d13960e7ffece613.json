I said \u2018My love, my life\u2019 and I ran, and thank God there was an ambulance on the corner,\u201d she continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why they were there, but I ran with her in my arms like a desperate mother, all bloody.\u201d\n\nThe nearby ambulance took the young girl to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center. However, medical staff could not revive her from severe head trauma.\n\nRELATED: California Father Dies After Being Crushed by Steel Plate at Disneyland Construction Site\n\n5-Year-Old Girl Killed After Stone Fence Falls on Her Head as Her Mom Watches on in Horror More\n\nSurveillance video from the building captured the heartbreaking incident on camera as it shows Alysson walk up to the fence with ornamental pillars beginning to teeter. As the 5-year-old nears the fence, they crash down, bringing her down with them.\n\nThe footage then shows Alysson\u2019s mother running over and scooping her daughter up from the rubble with other panicked witnesses. They proceed to run towards the street to look for help.\n\n\u201cThe baby did not climb on it, it just fell down,\u201d the building\u2019s landlord Harry Netchandro told ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to believe how the fence can drop like that.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Tennessee Teen, 15, Tragically Killed in Freak Accident While on a Missionary Trip to Mexico\n\nAlysson\u2019s family held a vigil for her on Friday night, and mourners gathered near the blood-stained sidewalk where the unsteady fence ended the girl\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cAll work needs to pass an inspection and I don\u2019t know how this managed to pass,\u201d Edgar Pinto, Alysson\u2019s father and Chaumana\u2019s estranged husband, told New York Daily News at the vigil.\n\nHe alleged that the pillars were haphazardly installed and never secured to the base of the fence. \u201cThere is nothing to hold it in, no screws or no cement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Department of Buildings ordered the landlords to take the fence down Friday and filed a violation for failure to maintain the property against the building\u2019s owner. The violation comes with fines ranging from $6,000 to $25,000, DOB officials told New York Daily News.\n\nThe family is calling for an investigation into the fence, which landlord Netchandro said was installed just a few months earlier, and the DOB said it did not receive any complaints about the fence prior to the incident.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea how it happened, everyone we\u2019ve talked to said it was sturdy,\u201d Netchandra told New York Daily News. \u201cWe would lean on it and everything. It\u2019s just something that happened, an accident. We feel horrible. We feel terrible. We saw the stepfather last night after it happened and we hugged and everything.\u201d", "description": "5-Year-Old Girl Killed After Stone Fence Falls on Her Head", "authors": ["Claudia Harmata"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oBKYlYNngAQKmfD_xASo_g--~B/aD0xOTcwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/b69d22e9234f78b11517b8f2416bde1e"}
