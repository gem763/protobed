It's complicated. And some local newsrooms, already struggling, are worried about being left behind.\n\n\"It's great that Facebook is willing to pay the New York Times and Washington Post, among other national news organizations, but while the tech giant is doing that, newspapers in smaller markets across the country are closing up shop and every day more of America is becoming a news desert,\" said Larry Gilbert, Jr., the audience engagement editor for the Sun Journal newspaper in Lewiston, Maine.\n\nOne of the Sun Journal's sister papers, Journal Tribune, ceased publication earlier this month.\n\nGilbert said Facebook has not contacted any of the sister papers, which represent most of Maine's big titles, about a distribution deal.\n\nLike many other journalists, Gilbert said he worries about the stories that won't be covered without local newspapers. \"What happens to rural states and small market cities when there's no one to cover them?\" he asked. \"Will there be none 10 or 15 years down the line because Facebook decided 'we're too small' for them?\"\n\nFacebook has anticipated the concern. The company says it intends to include a greater number of publishers in the future.\n\nFor now, Brown said, \"it's a range, from big publishers like CNN to more niche publishers that cover specific interests.\"\n\nThe payments \u2014 millions of dollars per year in some cases \u2014 are designed to make sure Facebook has access to all sorts of news coverage to fuel its algorithms.\n\nSkeptics say the payments, and the News section in general, are also intended to placate news organizations, to quiet some of the noise and criticism about Facebook's role in upending media business models.\n\nFacebook has de-emphasized links to news articles and prioritized friends and family content in the main News Feed -- because, the company says, that's what users say they want.\n\nHaving a dedicated News section may be a another move in that direction. And having the section doesn't mean that users will gravitate to it, of course.\n\nFacebook News on a phone screen\n\nLaunch partners include News Corp, CNN, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, BuzzFeed News, the Los Angeles Times, CBS, and Fox's owned-and-operated local stations.\n\nThe participation of two Rupert Murdoch properties \u2014 News Corp and Fox \u2014 is noteworthy because Murdoch and News Corp CEO Robert Thomson have been incredibly critical of tech giants like Facebook. The company is reportedly developing its own news aggregator to compete with Big Tech.\n\n\"If Facebook wants to recognize 'trusted' publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies,\" Murdoch said in January 2018.\n\nThomson will be at an event in New York City with Mark Zuckerberg on Friday in a show of public support for Facebook's News section.\n\nBrown, a former CNN anchor, declined to get into the details of the publisher payments.\n\n\"We want to make sure we are supporting their businesses,\" she said.\n\nThe potential upside for Facebook is obvious: A News section could make Facebook more valuable to its users.\n\n\"We think people can have a better news experience on the platform,\" she said. \"We also want to connect publishers with the people who are most interested in their content.\"\n\nThe addition of the new section also may mitigate some of the criticism that is constantly directed Facebook, from detractors who say the company's ad business has done untold damage to the news industry.\n\nRegarding Gilbert's concern about Maine, Facebook said in a Friday blog post that the initial test phase will include \"local original reporting by surfacing local publications from the largest major metro areas across the country, beginning with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington DC, Miami, Atlanta and Boston.\"\n\n\"In the coming months,\" Facebook said, \"we'll include local news from Today In, our local news and community information tab, which recently expanded to over 6,000 US towns and cities.\"", "description": "Facebook has a message for the skeptical news industry: We're here to help.", "authors": ["Brian Stelter", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191024225030-facebook-news-tab-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
