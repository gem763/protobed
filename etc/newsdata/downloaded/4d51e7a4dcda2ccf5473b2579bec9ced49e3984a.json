It doesn\u2019t have to be.", "language": "en", "text": "But that is not an accurate portrait. A lot of days my teen is all I think about. I\u2019m not uninvested, I\u2019m consumed. And one of the worst parts is that I can\u2019t talk to anyone about it because of the judgment and shame.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs much as some people would like to deny it, the fact is when your child is 17 and won\u2019t get up, there is nothing you can do. You can\u2019t drag a gangly, 6-foot-tall human from under their covers without being violent. What you can do is turn on a light, knock hard on their door, say their name louder and louder until they hear you. You can talk and plead, take their phone, ground them. You can ignore it and rely on natural consequences. Some or none of the time, some or none of those things might work.\n\nI used to think the baby years were so scary and vulnerable, but I had no context. I couldn\u2019t see into the teen years. I couldn\u2019t know how helpless those years would be; how untamed and unpredictable.\n\nMy teen didn\u2019t have tantrums when he was a toddler; he started throwing them at 6, when he was too tall and difficult to wrangle; when the stares and side-eyes from onlookers felt especially accusatory. At that point, I didn\u2019t have a parent group to draw on like I did when my kids were babies and toddlers. Those spaces virtually disappeared as my kids grew older. I often wonder why that happens, why there is such a perceived need for camaraderie and support for parents of young children but not for those of older kids and teens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParenting teens is this strange intersection of multiple layers of abandonment. My kids no longer want to hang out and talk like they used to. And alongside that totally normal developmental change, I also have lost the ability to discuss things with other parents.\n\nA couple of years ago I confided in another parent about some trouble my son had gotten into with a friend. She responded by insisting that my child was sweet and kind. The response felt like a chastisement, as though in expressing my concerns, I was somehow too narrowly focused or worrying needlessly. It\u2019s possible that I read into it, that she was merely trying to reassure me, make me feel better. That\u2019s the funny thing about the lack of communication among parents: The silence and judgment \u2014 perceived or otherwise \u2014 are effective deterrents and they feed on one another.\n\nThere is a right answer to the teacher asking, \u201cCan you help me?\u201d The right answer is, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll talk to him, yes I\u2019ll handle it, I\u2019ll make sure it never happens again.\u201d I stall. I could say the right answer and just pretend, but I don\u2019t. Instead, I tell her that it\u2019s tricky. I tell her that I\u2019m not sure what to do, but I\u2019ll try.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI pack up my things and drive home. I had planned on cramming another hour of work in before school lets out, but instead I climb the stairs to my room, pull on my pajamas and crawl into bed. Sometimes all I can do is collapse into a heap of exhaustion. I wonder about my own failure and let my thoughts sprint from one bad thing to the next. I start at the present then move through a mental list of accidents and mistakes, of divorce and traumas, of arguments and misunderstandings, of the push and pull of parent and child.\n\nI remember when his younger brother was born, I was shocked that no one had warned me about the impossibility of meeting two little humans\u2019 needs at once. Why was this difficulty \u2014 surely a common thing \u2014 some kind of guarded secret? I spent a full year repeatedly feeling like I was screwing up. I intentionally talked about those feelings and the difficulty a lot. I didn\u2019t want to scare parents, but I also didn\u2019t want them to be caught off-guard or to feel alone if they struggled, too.\n\nAs I think about my own challenges parenting a teenager, and my accompanying silence, I feel complicit in a way for not being more open about all of it. My fear of being a parenting failure is an ominous shadow, and I can\u2019t fathom enduring the criticism of another parent while I am so raw and tired. But I don\u2019t want someone else to suffer for my silence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTomorrow I\u2019ll be stronger, more prepared. I\u2019ll get out of bed, I\u2019ll try new approaches. I\u2019ll be more tender when I wake him up. I\u2019ll trip over the clothes and dishes on his floor and I\u2019ll keep my frustration over the mess to myself as I make my way to the edge of his bed. I\u2019ll sit and touch his arm and he\u2019ll open his eyes, slowly smile and reach for a hug. I\u2019ll think about how the difficult and the delicate moments interplay, how the battles wound and the gentleness soothes. Later, on a walk, I\u2019ll tell my spouse about it. And I\u2019ll think about ways to talk about these moments \u2014 the good and the ugly \u2014 with other parents who may be going through the same thing.\n\nKathi Valeii is a writer in southwest Michigan.
