Aechere Crump (left) and Pfc. Victor Alamo (right), Colorado native Ezra Maes, 21, was taking part in an overnight training exercise when he and his two crewmates fell asleep in their tank and awoke to find it speeding down a hill\n\nIt would later be discovered the 65-ton M1A1 Abrams had suffered a hydraulic leak, but with all operational systems failing, and with the tank hurtling down the hill at 90 MPH, Maes and his crew had no choice left but to brace for impact\n\n\u2018We realized there was nothing else we could do and just held on,\u2019 Maes said in a press release.\n\nAfter a number of sharp bumps, the tank crashed in an embankment at full speed, throwing Maes forward and causing his leg to get caught in the turret gear.\n\nThe armor crewman then felt the full force of the tank turret sliding onto his leg. He thought his leg was broken, but he remained more concerned about the injuries suffered by his crew mates.\n\nThe driver of the tank, Victor Alamo, was pinned down after smashing his head through the driver\u2019s hatch and braking his back.\n\nSgt. Aechere Crump, the gunner, had dislocated her leg and was bleeding profusely from a deep cut on her thigh.\n\nMaes immediately realized had ruptured her femoral artery.\n\nDetermined to assist his crew mates, Maes began twisting and turning trying to dislodge himself from the gearing believing his uniformed to be snagged on the on the mangled metal before him.\n\n\u2018I pushed and pulled at my leg as hard as I could to get loose and felt a sharp tear,\u2019 Maes said. \u2018I thought I had dislodged my leg, but when I moved away, my leg was completely gone.\u2019\n\nDetermined to assist his crew mates, Maes began twisting and turning trying to dislodge himself from the gearing believing his uniformed was snagged on the on the mass of mangled metal before him. \u2018I pushed and pulled at my leg as hard as I could to get loose and felt a sharp tear,\u2019 Maes said. \u2018I thought I had dislodged my leg, but when I moved away, my leg was completely gone.\u2019\n\nFreed from the pressure of the turret, blood began oozing from Maes\u2019 wound at a rapid rate, but with Crump and Alamo\u2019s lives on the line, Maes persevered through the panic and pain and pulled himself up and into the back of the tank to grab a medical kit.\n\nHalfway there, Maes said he started to feel lightheaded from the blood loss.\n\n\u2018I knew I was going into shock,\u2019 he said. \u2018All I could think about was no one knows we're down here.\u2019\n\nMaes added that he knew any hopes of survival rested on his shoulders.\n\n\u2018Either I step up or we all die,\u2019 he recalled thinking.\n\nMaes immediately started shock procedures on himself and his crew, ordering them to focus on their breathing and telling them to clinch their belts into makeshift tourniquets to stem any bleeding.\n\nThe tank\u2019s radio systems had been destroyed in the crash, and their cell phones were either dead or broken \u2013 all except one.\n\nIncredibly, Maes\u2019 phone started ringing. Cramp crawled towards it, with one leg broken and the other heavily cut, and tossed down to him, where he texted a friend to summon help.\n\nWhat happened next remains largely a blur for Maes, with his last memory of the incident an image of his sergeant major running up a hill carrying his leg on his shoulder.\n\n\u2018I wanted to keep it, see if it could be reattached, but it was pulverized,\u2019 Maes reflected.\n\nFreed from the pressure of the turret, blood began oozing from Maes\u2019 wound at a rapid rate, but with Crump and Alamo\u2019s lives on the line, Maes persevered through the panic and pain and pulled himself up and into the back of the tank to grab a medical kit\n\nHe was then rushed to hospital, where doctors found he had also broken his ankle, pelvis in three places and his shoulder.\n\nBetween an infection he picked up in transit and nearly daily surgeries to fend it off, Maes spent four months in intensive care.\n\n\u2018I feel super lucky,\u2019 he said. \u2018My crew all does. So many things could have gone wrong. Besides my leg, we all walked away pretty much unscathed.\u2019\n\nOne year on, the 21-year-old is still undergoing physical and occupational therapy at the Center for the Intrepid, BAMC\u2019s rehabilitation center. He does yoga up to three times a week, kayaks, works with service dogs \u2013 and just about anything he can do to stay active.\n\nMaes is currently in the process of being fitted for a long-term prosthetic leg, a permanent implant that will allow him to \u2018clip in and go\u2019.\n\nDespite the life-changing outcome of that fateful night, Maes insists he\u2019s been given a second chance at life and believes it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to him.\n\nI'll probably say that for the rest of my life,\u2019 he told Fox News. \u2018Every day I wake up and look at it, and I remember how close I was to losing it all. And I'm still here.\n\n\u2018I managed to survive, and this is just the scar I walked away with.\u2019\n\nMaes, whose great-grandfather served in the Army, now hopes to become a prosthetist and help others regain their mobility.\n\n\u2018When something like this happens, it's easy to give up because your life won't be the same, and you're not wrong,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Life will take a 180, but it doesn't have to be a bad thing. Don't let it hinder you from moving forward.\u2019", "description": "Ezra Maes, 21, was taking part in an overnight training exercise when he and his two crewmates fell asleep in their tank and awoke to find it speeding down a hill, before crashing at 90 mph.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/14/19955082-0-image-a-2_1571576408125.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
