But can he really turn his back on Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) and leave Neighbours?\n\nMark and Aaron (Matt Wilson) return from Adelaide and Aaron tells David (Takaya Honda) he has something to confess. David\u2019s heart stops when he thinks his husband is about to tell him they need to move away to help look after his mum, but it soon becomes clear Mark is the one who\u2019s chosen to leave.\n\nMark is ready to leave Ramsay Street, but he\u2019s planning on bowing out with minimal fuss. He can\u2019t bear the idea of emotional farewells and things just slinking off will be best for everyone. Aaron and David try to encourage him to say his goodbyes, but they\u2019re floored when he drops a bombshell on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile he\u2019s of course keen to get to Fay and help her as her condition worsens, he\u2019s in fact devastated to be leaving Erinsborough. He\u2019s packing up and leaving with a very heavy heart and cannot bear telling his loved ones to their faces that he\u2019s leaving his life behind.\n\nAs Mark tries to come to terms with his decision, a run-in with Roxy and advice from his brother start to make him see things differently \u2013 though he can\u2019t bring himself to say goodbye, he decides instead to record heart-breaking messages for everyone who meant something to him.\n\nMark is turning his back on Ramsay Street (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nThough Mark has kept it mostly to himself, Elly (Jodi Anasta) twigs something is going on and tries to get information out of Aaron. He cracks and tells her the truth, so she legs it to the lake where she finds Mark ready to beg him to stay. He\u2019s there saying his goodbyes to Sonya and Kate.\n\nElly is crushed that he\u2019s decided to leave, weighed down by the guilt of her own actions. He wouldn\u2019t be leaving if it wasn\u2019t for her, in fact he could have been enjoying a blissful life if she\u2019d remained faithful.\n\nBut is she about to try and stop him from going? Is there something still there for these two after all, or will Mark really just walk away?\n\nScenes air from Monday 14th October at 1.45pm and 5.30pm on Channel 5.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mark's ready to leave but is Elly ready to say goodbye?", "authors": ["Katie Baillie"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Neighbours_8109_EMBARGO_13_MAY_8-7126_1570190165.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
