Kamala Harris (D-CA) unsuccessfully tried at Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate to win Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over to her push for Twitter to ban Donald Trump, an issue that is quickly becoming a signature of Harris\u2019 presidential bid.\n\nHarris told Warren that she was \u201csurprised\u201d the Massachusetts senator hadn\u2019t backed her call, issued in early October, for Twitter to ban Trump from its site. In her letter to Twitter, Harris cited Trump\u2019s attacks on the Ukraine phone call whistleblower and his tweet about \u201ccivil war\u201d as reasons for Twitter to deplatform the president.\n\n\u201cI would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice,\u201d Harris told Warren during the debate. \u201cAnd he and his account should be taken down.\u201d\n\nWarren demurred, saying that she was focused on beating Trump in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI want to push him out of the White House. That\u2019s our job.\u201d\n\nHarris continued to press Warren to call for Trump to be banned from Twitter.\n\n\u201cSo join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cNo?\u201d Harris said.\n\nTwitter announced new rules Tuesday for tweets from Trump and other world leaders that may violate the site\u2019s rules. The new rules include a provision making it harder to share tweets that violate Twitter policies.", "description": "Harris repeatedly urged Warren to join her calls for Trump to be de-platformed, only to be met with a blunt response: \u201cNo.\u201d", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571193711/RTS2RBXW_sdyhsw", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
