They broke streetlights. They started fires. They tied wires across sidewalks to trip people.\n\nA Takoma Park, Md., girl nearly lost an arm after being hit with a stone by Halloween-inspired kids in 1939. A man nearly lost his eyesight after he was hit in the face with a stone in 1932, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nIn Fairfax County, Va., in 1929, roving bands of boys set off dynamite on their school grounds. Another group pulled boards and a large stone into the road and then covered it with leaves, causing a traffic accident. A similar prank killed three people in Waukegan, Ill.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were costing cities millions of dollars even in the early \u201930s,\u201d said Lisa Morton, author of \u201cTrick or Treat: A History of Halloween,\u201d in an interview with The Post. \u201cThere were a lot of cities that were really considering banning the holiday at that point. It was really, really intense.\u201d\n\nParents and civil groups needed a solution. A distraction. Or a bribe.\n\nAnd from this cauldron of parental panic, they pulled out an idea that, to this day, is part of what defines American Halloween.\n\nAD\n\nThey thought to throw the kids a party, but \u201cbecause this was the Great Depression, a lot of people didn\u2019t have the money \u2026 so one of the first things they did was called \u2018house-to-house parties.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe entire block would chip in. At the first house, you might get a costume \u2014 perhaps a sheet to be a ghost. The next house might give you some candy.\n\nAD\n\nIf that sounds like our modern-day trick-or-treating, yes, Morton said, that\u2019s where it comes from.\n\n\u201cOne of the most common misconceptions about Halloween is that trick-or-treating is some ancient ritual that goes back thousands of years,\u201d Morton said. \u201cNo, it really is less than 100 years old.\u201d\n\nBut the denouement would be the house with \u201ca simple haunt situation set up, often in their basement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey would take the kids down the stairs, and it would be really dark. And they would play that classic thing where they might tell the kids to put their hands in a bowl of peeled grapes and tell them it was eyeballs, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nA 1937 party pamphlet Morton quoted in her book offered tips on how to create a low-cost but terrifying experience:\n\n\u201cHang old fur, strips of raw liver on walls, where one feels his way to dark steps. \u2026 Weird moans and howls come from dark corners, damp sponges and hair nets hung from the ceiling touch his face. \u2026 At one place \u2018Tige\u2019 who is a guard dressed as a dog, suddenly jumps out at him, barking and growling.\u201d\n\nPretty soon, the civic group called the Junior Chamber, also known as the Jaycees, got in the action. They sponsored \u201ctrails of terror\u201d \u2014 basically outdoor versions of house-to-house parties in an open field.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe plan worked terrifically, and within a few generations the dangerous pranks were nearly eradicated, replaced by haunted houses and trick-or-treating.\n\nIn 1969, Disneyland opened its newest attraction, the Haunted Mansion. Though \u201cdark ride\u201d attractions have a long history at carnivals and amusement parks, the Haunted Mansion inspired folks to kick up their local, Halloween-related haunted houses a notch.\n\nThe Jaycees upped their game, but in the 1970s, no one did it better than the Christian group Campus Life. They had mazes, costumed actors and lots of gore in charity haunted houses all over the country.\n\n\u201cI went through one when I was, like, 12, and it was kind of traumatic at that point,\u201d Morton said. \u201cYou would sit down on a bench to watch an operation, and the bench had actually been wired to give you little electrical zaps.\u201d\n\nItsi Atkins, whom The Post\u2019s John Kelly wrote about in 2016, claims to be one of the first people to open a professional, interactive haunted house business. He opened Blood Manor in St. Mary\u2019s County, Md., in 1971.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHaunted attractions nowadays have to follow safety regulations, and offer all kinds of frights. There are haunted houses in abandoned prisons, \u201czombie\u201d strip malls and on-the-market real estate; \u201chell houses\u201d from evangelical groups who try to scare visitors into salvation; and even \u201chaunted trap houses\u201d that warn people about the real-life horrors of opiate addiction.\n\nScaring people, young and old, is a big business.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAD", "description": "By the 1930s, Halloween 'pranks' by teenage boys were turning deadly.
