His dealings have been very good so far.\n\n\"Give him the money other managers have had to get Man Utd players.\n\n\"Get another five or six players like that in, we will see a real difference.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"They are missing that creative player. It is no coincidence, the best performances have been against good teams. The lesser teams are always harder to break down.\n\n\"We are probably just a bit shy of them creative players and I think Ole recognises that.\"\n\nGiggs, who is currently the Wales international manager, has shrugged off any thoughts that Solskjaer should be sacked and instead thinks that anyone would have struggled after taking over from Jose Mourinho last December.\n\n\"It has been a difficult start,\" Giggs said. \"As far as Ole is concerned, I know him well, as a player and person.\n\n\"He is going to need time. Since the manager left, different philosophies and types of players and Ole is trying to turn that around.\n\n\"He is looking at the future and trying to win games at the same time. It is difficult.\n\n\"When you are in a league with Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola fantastic, established coaches.\n\n\"I don't care who came in, it was never going to be easy.\"", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has endured a rocky first full season as Man Utd manager but results have started to up turn", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "The United Stand", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20746082.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-28-at-223056.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
