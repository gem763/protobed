He\u2019s ready for it, but it\u2019ll be me who decides how he is introduced. We need to show calm and use our heads a bit.\u201d\n\nThere was more mixed news on the injury front for Real as James Rodriguez returned to full training, but Luka Modric came back from international duty with an adductor issue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s positives and negatives. We lose Luka but get other lads back,\u201d the French coach said.\n\nThe Croat\u2019s injury means Toni Kroos and Casemiro are the only fit central midfielders available to Zidane.\n\n\u201cThis is the squad we have and we can\u2019t make any changes to that. Everyone will get their chance to bring their qualities to this side,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHopefully Modric will be back quickly, but we have to accept that he\u2019s got no chance tomorrow.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.9006 euros)", "description": "Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said he will resist rushing Eden Hazard back from injury as he played down hopes of the Belgian making his long-awaited first start for the club when they host Levante in La Liga on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429428241&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C13F", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
