At the time, trademark attorney David Leichtman explained on Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM that it would be difficult to differentiate James\u2019 use of \u201cTaco Tuesday\u201d even with his celebrity status. There was also the added problem that a restaurant chain named Taco John\u2019s had already initially filed for the mark back in 1989.\n\nTORONTO, ONTARIO - AUGUST 02: NBA Player Lebron James attends the Uninterrupted Canada Launch held at Louis Louis at The St. Regis Toronto on August 02, 2019 in Toronto, Canada.

As such, James\u2019 application was denied for being \u201cconfusingly similar to the registered mark.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all bad news for the Los Angeles Laker. James could still respond to the USPTO filing with added or adjusted language within six months if he so chooses. And according to what someone in his circle reportedly told ESPN, James still may have achieved what he set out to do by establishing \u201cTaco Tuesday\u201d as a generic term to cover for any legal claims that could be brought against his use of the term.\n\nYou can read the USPTO\u2019s full response to James\u2019 trademark filing here.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
