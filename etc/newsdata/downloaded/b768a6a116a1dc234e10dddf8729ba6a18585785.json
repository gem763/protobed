It is not mentioned when the smartphone will come to Europe, though it will likely be around the same time as the US.\n\nA spokesperson for Samsung refused to confirm further details when contacted by The Independent.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold marks a major departure from the slab-like design of smartphones that has become standard over the last decade.\n\nOther smartphone makers have been developing foldable phones, including the world's second largest smartphone maker Huawei.\n\nThe Chinese manufacturer was also forced to delay the launch of the Mate Flex due to similar concerns about its design.\n\nOne of the main issues with the new design is with the integrated hinge and flexible screen that needs to survive thousands of folds within the typical life span of a phone without showing signs of wear.\n\nIn order to address these issues, Samsung said in July that it had added additional reinforcements to the top and bottom of the hinge area, as well as extending a protective layer placed over the screen.", "description": "Samsung's highly-anticipated folding phone may be\u00a0just one week away from being relaunched, following months of delays.
