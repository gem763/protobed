The president has frequently attacked CNN and just three months ago called for a boycott of AT&T. The network and the White House got into a dispute last week as controversy over Trump\u2019s claim that Hurricane Dorian threatened Alabama was raging. A CNN spokesperson tweeted the network had its highest August ratings on record last month.\n\nRead: White House tells CNN to \u2018study up on U.S. geography,\u2019 and the gloves are off.\n\nNew York Times reporter Maggie Haberman noted Trump\u2019s subsequent tweet bashing CNN as \u201cbad for the USA\u201d came as the network was reporting that the U.S. extracted from Russia one of its highest-level covert sources inside the Russian government, partly over concerns about how Trump handled classified intelligence.\n\nTALIBAN TALKS \u2018DEAD\u2019\n\nTrump called peace talks with the Taliban \u201cdead\u201d as he left the White House for a rally in North Carolina.\n\nTrump called off a secret meeting this weekend at Camp David with Taliban and Afghanistan leaders after a bombing in Kabul last week killed an American soldier.\n\nNow see: Trump reveals via tweet that secret Camp David meeting on Sunday with Taliban is canceled.\n\n\u2018THREE STOOGES\u2019\n\nTrump attacked a trio of Republicans who are challenging him for the GOP presidential nomination, dubbing them the \u201cThree Stooges.\u201d\n\nHe singled out former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford, the latest to announce his candidacy. Sanford joins former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld and former Rep. Joe Walsh.\n\nOn Twitter, Trump referenced Sanford\u2019s 2009 disappearance from South Carolina\u2019s capital, in which he later admitted he was in Argentina having an extramarital affair. \u201cBut now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go!\u201d Trump said. He also told reporters he would not debate the challengers. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to give them any credibility,\u201d he said.\n\nNow read: GOP won\u2019t give much help to Trump primary challengers.\n\nIn another tweet, Trump addressed a Politico story that said aircrews had occasionally stayed at his Scotland resort while refueling at a small commercial airport nearby. \u201cNOTHING TO DO WITH ME,\u201d Trump said \u2014 though he complemented the crew\u2019s \u201cgood taste\u201d for staying at one of his properties.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump says he welcomed the involvement of an activist investor in AT&T, suggesting it could lead to a stop to what he routinely...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG202_trump__ZG_20190322114202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
