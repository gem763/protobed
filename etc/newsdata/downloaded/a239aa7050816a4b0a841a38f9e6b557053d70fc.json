'It's just awful. Even though we're totally left-leaning, we don't want to admit it.'\n\nThe Washington Examiner first obtained the letter, which was uploaded to an anonymous account on the Scribd.com document-sharing website.\n\nIt suggests that CNN's only hope of avoiding litigation is to reach a civil settlement \u2013 including 'a substantial payment of damages' of the type that the president would likely trumpet on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump routinely singles out CNN as a purveyor of 'fake news,' and his rally crowds often erupt in chants of 'CNN sucks! CNN sucks!' before he arrives to speak.\n\nOne CNN reporter, Jim Acosta, has been openly combative with the Trump White House. He wrote a book this year that excoriates the president for calling journalists with their thumbs on the scales 'the enemy of the people.'\n\nTrump said Tuesday on Twitter that CNN was out to 'destroy' him, and asked: 'Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?'", "description": "In a statement to DailyMail.com, a CNN spokesman said: 'This is nothing more than a desperate PR stunt and doesn't merit a response.'", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/19/19897548-0-image-a-11_1571422880172.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
