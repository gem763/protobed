Even before Durham received his new powers, Democrats and others had expressed concerns that Trump wanted to weaponize the Justice Department to further his political aims.\n\nUntil now, Durham, who heads the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Connecticut, has been doing a review into U.S. counterintelligence activities conducted by the CIA, FBI and other agencies before and after the 2016 election, especially related to Trump\u2019s campaign and the early days of his presidency.", "description": "The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into whether Donald Trump or his 2016 presidential campaign was illegally spied upon, according to a person familiar with the matter, escalating the controversy surrounding an inquiry that has remained largely secret for months.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Emily Hill", "Nigel Farage", "John Longworth"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214054521-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqyH--JwBfI8iL9dN4Vc1pV74XqXPgYCdJPxFfhB2AJY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
