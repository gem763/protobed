Even when you don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re talking about, it will sound as though you do. Just remember that whatever you promise must be delivered. CALL 0904 470 1167 (65p per minute)*\n\nSCORPIO 24 Oct-22 Nov The Sun at odds with Saturn means you must confront and eliminate your emotional hang-ups. A new chapter in your life will begin once the Sun enters your sign later this month. Go into it with absolute confidence in who you really are. CALL 0904 470 1168 (65p per minute)*\n\nSAGITTARIUS 23 Nov-21 Dec Nothing is beyond you this week \u2013 if you can imagine it, you can achieve it. Even emotional relationships will be easier to handle. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for what you want \u2013 and don\u2019t be afraid to make use of it once you get it. CALL 0904 470 1169 (65p per minute)*\n\nCAPRICORN 22 Dec-20 Jan It takes planning and effort to turn dreams into reality \u2013 a tricky Sun-Saturn aspect means the hard work is about to start. Focus on the task you\u2019ve set yourself and refuse to be sidetracked by interesting but ultimately meaningless developments. CALL 0904 470 1170 (65p per minute)*\n\nAQUARIUS 21 Jan-19 Feb You\u2019ll get the opportunity this week to talk over any ego issues which may be harming a special relationship. Chances are that what you thought was an insoluble problem can easily be fixed once you stop looking at it in such a negative way. CALL 0904 470 1171 (65p per minute)*\n\nPISCES 20 Feb-20 March You cannot afford to antagonise those whose support you may need. Discussions about property, investments or legal issues will feature prominently this week, but you\u2019ll come through unscathed if you\u2019re not tempted to oppose everything you disagree with. CALL 0904 470 1172 (65p per minute)*\n\nARIES 21 March-20 April Don\u2019t try to leave tough decisions to others, as current aspects demand that you take a lead role in both personal and professional matters this week. You may be afraid of wielding so much power, but you are also uniquely equipped to use it wisely. CALL 0904 470 1161 (65p per minute)*\n\nTAURUS 21 April-21 May You are likely to be unusually withdrawn and unsociable this week. Don\u2019t wallow in it but don\u2019t fight it either, because the more time you spend thinking about the problems of the past, the less likely it is you will make the same mistakes in the future. CALL 0904 470 1162 (65p per minute)*\n\nGEMINI 22 May-21 June You have earned your share of the good things in life \u2013 now you must give yourself permission to enjoy them. For some reason, you are feeling strangely negative just now, when, in fact, you have every reason to be proud of your achievements. CALL 0904 470 1163 (65p per minute)*\n\nCANCER 22 June-23 July Mistakes have been made \u2013 some quite serious \u2013 but things are not as bad as they seem.

CALL 0904 470 1164 (65p per minute)*\n\nLEO 24 July-23 Aug Leos tend to be generous, but you may be finding the demands of others on your time and energy just too much. If so, don\u2019t be afraid to stand up for your rights \u2013 sadly you\u2019ll be respected more if you make a scene than if you discuss things rationally. CALL 0904 470 1165 (65p per minute)*\n\nVIRGO 24 Aug-23 Sept Whatever your age or circumstances, money and status are no longer enough. You need a job to get your teeth into \u2013 regardless of the pay \u2013 even if it means cutting back on existing commitments. Enjoyment counts for more than profit.
