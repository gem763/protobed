Sometimes it\u2019s because devices like iPhones, iPads and Mac computers are far more resistant to threats like viruses.\n\nFor instance, here\u2019s one of the great things about owning an iPad \u2014 unless you\u2019ve jailbroken it, the chance of it becoming infected with a virus is almost zero. That\u2019s great, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re completely in the clear.\n\nEven if a full-fledged virus can't take over your iPad, threats like malware still exist. You know those phishing scams that trick you into providing information like passwords on malicious sites? Those links can also be sent to your iPad as easily as they\u2019re sent to your computer.\n\nLuckily, there are a few ways to verify you\u2019re not looking at adware or a phishing scam, and they don\u2019t necessitate buying anything. I\u2019ll also tell you how to protect your iPad so you can avoid these issues altogether.\n\nChecking your iPad for malware and other problems\n\nTo check if you\u2019re looking at adware or a phishing scam on your iPad when you\u2019re browsing the internet, check the URL in your web browser. If the URL has misspellings or a lot of numbers and letters, it\u2019s very likely a scam and you should just exit the page.\n\nIf you keep encountering a page that says you have malware or a virus on your device, or you keep seeing a persistent pop-up ad, you may need to clear out your iPad\u2019s cache. Doing this will sadly eliminate most saved passwords from your browser, which can be annoying. Just make sure you have your passwords stored elsewhere, such as a password manager, before you follow the next steps so you can re-save them all and get back to normal iPad use quickly.\n\nOnce you have your passwords ready to go, go to Settings, then tap Safari in the left menu. Tap the \u201cClear History and Website Data\u201d link on the lower part of the page and tap \u201cClear\u201d to confirm your choice. That malware/virus warning should now go away altogether, as should any pop-ups.\n\nIf you\u2019ve received an odd notification in your email, rather than while browsing the internet, check the email address. Again, if the address has misspellings or isn\u2019t officially from somewhere where you have an account or subscription, it\u2019s very likely a scam and you should report it as spam, then delete it from your inbox.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your iPad\u2019s behavior after you\u2019ve jailbroken the device (which is not recommended), think back to any of your recent downloads. Were any of the apps from outside the App Store or from a company whose identity you have trouble verifying? Or is just one particular app acting oddly? The problem might be that app.\n\nCheck the developer\u2019s social media pages for any news of issues, and make sure you have the most up-to-date version of the app. If things are up to date, and there aren\u2019t issues being reported, uninstall the app and see if problems continue elsewhere on your iPad. If they don\u2019t, you found the culprit!\n\nTry to find an alternative app for that function in the future. If the problem persists, continue checking recent app downloads, or file downloads, and see if uninstalling these fixes your problem.\n\nWe also have tips to check if your iPads are giving bad information, or are genuinely compromised. Let\u2019s see how we can protect our iPads so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nKeep your iPad from being compromised\n\nWe\u2019ve already talked about checking URLs and email addresses before clicking links, or providing personal information. On top of doing this, it\u2019s incredibly important to keep your iPad, and your apps, up to date. Updates from Apple and app developers come with new security features, or direct responses to hacks or bad code. If you want to keep adware, malware and even some phishing scams off of your iPad, you need to stay on top of software updates, both for iOS and for each individual app.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s best not to jailbreak your iPad to keep it 100% safe and to keep it repairable, as most Apple Genius bars won\u2019t work to help a jailbroken device. If that is what you decide to do, however, make sure you take a few more safety precautions when you use it. Try using a VPN (such as ExpressVPN) while you browse the internet so it\u2019s harder for your device to be targeted or seen by outsiders.\n\nDownload apps only from reputable developers. Consider getting an anti-virus app like Bitdefender Mobile Security, which can provide a bit more security to your device in the form of remote locks, added web protection and device wipe features.\n\nAlso remember restarting your device can sometimes help reset it if bad software has gotten in, and that kick people accessing your device remotely off your iPad. Also consider clearing your cache periodically so adware gets flushed out before it tricks you, or becomes an annoyance when you use your tablet.\n\nThe last way to protect your iPad is to back it up regularly, to cloud storage or your computer. If malware gets in that necessitates you restoring your iPad to factory settings, you\u2019ll be less impeded if you have clean backups available, and your iPad can be back up and functioning that much sooner.\n\niPads are some of the safest devices when it comes to malware and viruses, but they\u2019re still vulnerable to some attacks. Keep your iPad safe by knowing what to watch out for, and protecting it in advance with the advice we\u2019ve provided.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?
