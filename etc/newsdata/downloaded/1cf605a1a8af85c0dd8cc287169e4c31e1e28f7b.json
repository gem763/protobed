Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defied Congress on Tuesday by attempting to block the depositions of five department employees called to testify in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe inquiry itself was sparked by a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations against former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son.\n\nIn each of these instances, the president or administration officials have strongly defended their conduct as proper and above board.\n\nBut taken together, they illustrate the sweeping reach of Trump\u2019s power and the culture he has spawned inside the government. The president\u2019s personal concerns have become priorities of departments that traditionally have operated with some degree of political independence from the White House \u2014 and their leaders are engaging their boss\u2019s obsessions.\n\n\u201cBarr and Pompeo are stuck in the fog machine. They seem captives of the president\u2019s perverse worldview,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, a historian and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. \u201cAuthoritarian regimes have this problem all the time . . . when all government activity is the product of the id of the leader. But in a republic, that\u2019s unusual.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost Republicans have stood by Trump. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), echoing many of them, told reporters it would be \u201cinsane\u201d to impeach Trump and said the exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was appropriate.\n\nTrump\u2019s moves underscore his transformation as president. He arrived in Washington a neophyte uncertain about how to operate the machinery of government. But now, in his third year in office, Trump has grown confident about exercising power, disposing of aides who acted as guardrails and elevating those who prove their loyalty by following his orders.\n\nAs the president said last month after John Bolton\u2019s abrupt exit as national security adviser, \u201cIt\u2019s very easy actually to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump was sworn in as the 45th president with less governmental experience than any of his predecessors. His advisers tried to tutor him about the three branches of government and the constitutional balance of powers. The general ethos among Trump\u2019s top aides then was to protect institutions and moderate some of the president\u2019s swings \u2014 to resist rather than follow his impulses, as described by one former senior White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment.\n\nAD\n\nSince then, Trump has become more emboldened to make decisions and has systematically dispensed with much of his early team, including former defense secretary Jim Mattis, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, former White House chiefs of staff Reince Priebus and John F. Kelly, former White House counsel Donald McGahn, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, former economic adviser Gary Cohn and others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there are many, if any, left who view as their responsibility trying to help educate, moderate, enlighten and persuade \u2014 or even advise in many cases,\u201d the former senior official said. \u201cThere\u2019s a new ethos: This is a presidency of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Trump unleashed, unchained, unhinged,\u201d this official added. \u201cHe continues to go further and further and further, and now I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody telling him, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s closest aides and friends strongly contest the suggestion that he is unbridled and pursuing his personal interests at the expense of the nation. Instead, they cast him as a politician who is curious, at times to a fault, about the investigations into his 2016 campaign and determined to reveal more about those efforts. They shrug off his moves as \u201cTrump being Trump\u201d and part of the president\u2019s showmanship in driving the national political debate as opposed to a possible constitutional reckoning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually very calm,\u201d said one White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cHe\u2019s not raging. He\u2019s not fuming. He can\u2019t stand what some people write or say on television, sure, but his presidency isn\u2019t consumed by that.\u201d\n\nSam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser, said the president has long wanted to be the sole driver of his message, with everyone else playing supporting roles \u2014 which is how he ran his business and 2016 campaign from his corner office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in New York.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be the one adjusting and taking the lead on where it goes, not adjusting to others,\u201d Nunberg said. \u201cIt goes back to how he navigated network TV, the tabloids and business publicity. That\u2019s his playbook.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome outside scholars have a different interpretation. Trump\u2019s moves represent a fundamental reorientation of American democracy, said Timothy Snyder, a Yale history professor and author of \u201cOn Tyranny,\u201d a resistance guide to what he describes as America\u2019s turn toward authoritarianism.\n\n\u201cRather than having the boring system we take for granted, where you have laws based on facts, instead you have a personality who makes up his own reality,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cAt first, that reality is just confusing and seems to gum up the works, but after a while, the leader starts to draw people into that reality by making them defend it or making them prove it. This is what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s Washington, many administration officials have calculated that if they do not enthusiastically wade into Trump\u2019s riptide of grievances and personal pursuits, they risk being ridiculed or sidelined by the president, as was the case with Bolton, a hawk whom Trump has mocked since his departure as \u201cMr. Tough Guy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe implicit day-to-day charge for many Trump advisers is simple, according to aides and other officials familiar with the president\u2019s Cabinet and West Wing staff: Figure out how to handle or even polish Trump\u2019s whims and statements, but do not have any illusion that you can temper his relentless personality, heavy consumption of cable news or thirst for political combat.\n\nAcquiescence is central to survival. Trump has bonded with aides who take his running complaints about the \u201cdeep state\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d seriously, along with his embrace of people and positions outside of the mainstream. The leading members of Trump\u2019s inner circle dutifully work to address his concerns, sometimes by directing federal resources.\n\nOfficials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, for example, have worked to block Democratic lawmakers and others from obtaining access to Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has refused to disclose publicly.\n\nThe list of Trump loyalists pulled into his maneuvers begins at the top. Vice President Pence traveled to Europe in early September and met with Zelensky and urged him to address \u201ccorruption,\u201d seeming to reiterate the message Trump communicated to Zelensky in July about investigating the Bidens. This was before promised U.S. military aid to Ukraine was released.\n\nBarr\u2019s role in the investigation into the Russia probe\u2019s origins, which is being conducted by U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut, is extraordinary in part because the probe seeks evidence of misconduct within his own Justice Department to support the conspiracy theory \u2014 embraced by Trump and advanced on Fox News \u2014 that the Russia inquiry was corrupt and predicated on undermining Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnalysis: Government-by-conspiracy-theory rides again\n\nSnyder said the investigation Trump sought and Barr is pursuing fits a pattern of behavior in which leaders try to disprove or undermine facts \u2014 in this case, the conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump win \u2014 with other investigations.\n\n\u201cThe idea of investigating the investigation is that you cast doubt on the boring factual staff,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t win with your adventurous fiction, you also win if your adventurous fiction casts doubt on the boring facts.\u201d\n\nThe White House and Justice Department have defended this review of the investigation into possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign as appropriate; Barr told Congress in April that he believed \u201cspying did occur.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBarr\u2019s interest in the probe is unsurprising to several of his associates, who said this week he is a headstrong and deeply conservative man who at this point in his career has grown disdainful of the Democratic Party, the federal government and the news media, criticizing them in private as biased and skewed against the president.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers say he respects Barr\u2019s approach and considers him \u201ctough,\u201d especially compared to former attorney general Jeff Sessions, who in 2017 recused himself from the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cWe have a great attorney general now,\u201d Trump said of Barr in July. \u201cHe\u2019s strong, and he\u2019s smart.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s personal concerns have become priorities of departments that traditionally have operated with some degree of political independence from the White House \u2014 and their leaders are engaging their boss\u2019s obsessions.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9v3MQBYi6SWzZ-U7cI_5hKzoy9o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7UG7XZXDWYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
