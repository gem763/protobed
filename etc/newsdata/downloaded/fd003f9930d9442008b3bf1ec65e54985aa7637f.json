How to improve your phone's battery life Show all 9 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. How to improve your phone's battery life 1/9 Limit notifications Notifications are incredibly useful, but they also drain battery life and not all of them are actually necessary. Switching off notifications for certain apps can help your phone\u2019s stamina. On Android, head into Settings, hit Apps and select those you don\u2019t need to be notified by. On iOS, go to Settings and then Notifications. 2/9 Disable auto-sync Certain apps, such as email and social networks, constantly run in the background even when you\u2019re not using them. This is so you see updated information and updates when you do open the apps, but the benefits can be offset by the amount of battery life auto-sync can eat up. On Android, you can turn off auto-sync by going to Settings, Accounts and hitting the menu button. On iOS, go to Settings, General and Background App Refresh. However, since auto-sync is genuinely useful, we\u2019d recommend disabling it when you know you\u2019re going to be running low on battery life, rather than switching it off all the time. 3/9 Switch off location services GPS is a huge drain on your phone\u2019s battery, as more and more apps use your location data to work out where you are, and shape your experience according to that information. Unless you\u2019re using a Maps app, you can get by without it. To turn off GPS on Android, go to Settings and Location. On iOS, go to Settings, Privacy and Location Services. 4/9 Lower brightness Your phone\u2019s display is responsible for the biggest impact on your battery life, but it\u2019s easy to limit how much energy it uses up. Auto-brightness is convenient, but often sets the screen brightness to a much higher level than it needs to be. Turning auto-brightness off, setting your display\u2019s brightness to a lower level and adjusting it when you need to is much more sensible. 5/9 Uninstall apps you don\u2019t need Some apps drain more battery life than others, and it\u2019s worth working out which ones you can do without. Facebook, for instance, is known to have a big impact on your phone\u2019s battery, and you can eliminate this by deleting the app and using the social network in your web browser instead. On Android and iOS, you can see the apps and processes that are affecting your battery by going to Settings and Battery. From there, work out what you can delete or replace with a less-demanding alternative. 6/9 Cut your assistant off Virtual assistants are becoming increasingly capable, and therefore increasingly important in tech companies\u2019 eyes. Not all consumers share the enthusiasm of Google and Apple though, and rarely - if ever - use Google Assistant and Siri. Whether you use them or not, by default the two assistants are always listening out for their trigger words, and this uses up battery life. On Android, you can switch this off by going to Settings, Google, Search, Voice and \u201cOk Google\u201d detection. On iOS, go to Settings, Siri and Allow \u201cHey Siri\u201d. 7/9 Stop vibrating Vibrate is a great middle-ground between a potentially disruptive ringtone and total, uncertain silence, but it also uses up the most battery life of the three options. You can go a step further by also disabling tap feedback, which can be reassuring, but is ultimately unnecessary. 8/9 Turn off connections If you\u2019re connected to a Wi-Fi network, switch your mobile data off, and vice versa. Similarly, remember to turn off Bluetooth and NFC when you\u2019re not using them. 9/9 Airplane mode Airplane mode isn\u2019t just for when you\u2019re on an aeroplane. If you know you\u2019re not going to have or won\u2019t need signal or a Wi-Fi connection for a good amount of time, it\u2019s worth enabling Airplane mode. Otherwise, your phone will use up battery life by pointlessly trying to connect to a network. 1/9 Limit notifications Notifications are incredibly useful, but they also drain battery life and not all of them are actually necessary.
