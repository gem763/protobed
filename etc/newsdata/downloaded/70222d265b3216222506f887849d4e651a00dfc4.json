Around three dozen of the trailers they once ferried between auto plants \u2014 packed with dashboards, engine components, lights and other parts for General Motors \u2014 are sitting in a lot with nowhere to go.\n\nIt\u2019s an increasingly familiar scene as the strike against GM by the United Auto Workers enters its fourth week. From suppliers to shippers to restaurants, the impact of the work stoppage is spreading through the web of businesses whose fates are tied to the biggest American automaker.\n\nI might lose the business next week Wael Tlaib of Phoenix Transit\n\nWael Tlaib, the owner of Phoenix Transit & Logistics, said he had laid off nearly his entire staff, including 80 drivers, and had dipped into his personal savings to keep his company afloat.\n\n\u201cI might lose the business next week,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\nThe most intense economic pain is being felt in the industrial Midwest, where GM\u2019s network of plants and suppliers is thickest. It is a difficult time for the region\u2019s manufacturing industry, which even before the strike was contending with slowing auto sales, a weakening global economy and the trade war.\n\nAn economic blow to the Midwest would have broad consequences in part because the region is an important political battleground that will help determine who wins the 2020 presidential election. In 2016, President Donald Trump\u2019s narrow victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin put him over the top in the Electoral College tally.\n\nThe state of the auto industry \u201cusually has political ramifications that are beyond its direct economic influence,\u201d said Matt Grossmann, a political-science professor at Michigan State University. \u201cA lot of Democrats here are running on the promise to help the factory workers and the working class, and saying Trump hasn\u2019t done it.\u201d\n\nNearly 50,000 UAW members walked off the job Sept. 16, the largest stoppage since GM workers went on strike in 2007. The union is pressing for more job security as well as the reopening of plants in the United States that the company has recently idled. GM wants workers to pick up more of their health care costs and agree to give managers greater flexibility in factory operations.\n\nAfter signs of progress over the last week, the two sides hit a roadblock last weekend on how production might be moved to the United States from Mexico. Terry Dittes, the UAW\u2019s lead negotiator, said Sunday that the talks had taken a \u201cturn for the worse.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the strike stretches from Mexico to Canada, where GM plants that depend on American factories have been shuttered, putting thousands out of work. Analysts estimate that GM has lost US$600 million as a result of the strike.\n\nIn the United States, 34 GM plants have gone dark. And striking workers are making do with a US$250-a-week subsidy from the union.\n\nIn the first three weeks of the strike, US$412 million in wages were lost, according to Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group.\n\n\u201cEach week the damage grows geometrically,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cFirst you lose your UAW workers, then the immediate suppliers, then the next tiers.\u201d\n\nMichigan has the most exposure to the auto sector, with roughly 8 per cent of the state\u2019s economy linked to the industry. Even after factory closures decimated employment in the car industry in recent decades, the state remains dotted with auto plants and suppliers.\n\nGabriel Ehrlich, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Research Seminar in Qualitative Economics, estimates that the Michigan economy is growing at an annual rate of 1.4 per cent. Without the strike, he said, that number could be 0.1 to 0.2 points higher.\n\nEven before the strike, manufacturing employment in Michigan fell by 1,300 jobs in the first eight months of the year. By comparison, manufacturers added 43,000 jobs nationally in the same period.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been real damage to the economy,\u201d said Charles Ballard, an economics professor at Michigan State. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been huge yet but the ripple effects will get bigger the longer this goes on.\u201d\n\nIn Flint, at least 1,200 truckers and production workers from suppliers have lost their jobs because of the strike. That includes hundreds from a supplier of seats to GM, Lear Corp., according to Duane Ballard, the financial secretary for UAW Local 659, which represents employees at that factory.\n\nA Lear spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany of those workers are new hires who have not worked at the Lear plant long enough to qualify for state unemployment insurance, Ballard said.\n\nOn a rainy night last week, more than two dozen people affected by the strike showed up at the Martus Luna Food Pantry in Flint, said Art Luna, who runs the pantry.\n\nThey \u201care the ones that are really hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious to go back to work.\u201d\n\nThe fallout has extended beyond the auto industry, disrupting local businesses that serve autoworkers.\n\nOn a typical Saturday night, Luigi\u2019s Restaurant, an Italian eatery a short drive from the Lear factory, sees around 350 customers. But in recent weeks, that number has fallen by as many as 60 people, according to Tom Beaubien, who runs the restaurant.\n\n\u201cAfter one week without pay, everybody starts to suffer, from McDonald\u2019s all the way to Luigi\u2019s Restaurant,\u201d Beaubien said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear just how many workers have been laid off by GM\u2019s suppliers. Magna International, one of the world\u2019s largest auto suppliers, has idled \u201ca few\u201d plants, according to a spokeswoman, Tracy Fuerst. \u201cWe attempted to keep our employees at these impacted plants working as long as possible through training, maintenance and inventory,\u201d she said.\n\nSome GM suppliers are finding creative ways to keep workers occupied, whether repairing machines or building an inventory of auto components to ship later.\n\n\u201cYour smarter suppliers are being very careful about how they lay people off,\u201d said Michael Robinet, an expert on the auto industry at IHS Markit. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to lose their better employees to a competitor or to another occupation.\u201d\n\nOf course, Michigan\u2019s economy is not as dependent on the auto sector as it was even two decades ago. Lansing has two GM plants but their economic weight is counterbalanced by the state government and the city\u2019s hospital system, said Andy Schor, the city\u2019s mayor. Another large employer, Michigan State University, is nearby.\n\n\u201cThe sooner they resolve this the better but I wouldn\u2019t say everything has shut down in Lansing,\u201d Schor said. Overall, GM and its suppliers account for 6,600 jobs with US$250 million in annual wages in the city, which has roughly 118,000 residents.\n\nSchor said autoworkers had been asking the city-owned utility for more time to pay their electric and water bills.\n\nYet even at companies that are not highly dependent on GM, the effect of the strike was immediate. Pridgeon & Clay, a component maker that sells to GM\u2019s suppliers, froze hiring right away.\n\n\u201cWe heard from our customers within hours,\u201d said R. Kevin Clay, the company\u2019s president. Business had already been a little soft at Pridgeon and Clay, which is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, when the strike began.\n\nGM suppliers account for about US$13 million of the company\u2019s US$300 million in annual revenue. Now parts destined for the automaker are piled up in corners of the company\u2019s distribution center.\n\nClay said he was determined to avoid layoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly eating into profitability but rather than cut people, you pinch every penny,\u201d he said.\n\nOther manufacturers, like Stripmatic in Cleveland, say manpower has been tight recently, and the strike has freed workers for other tasks.\n\nBut Bill Adler, the company\u2019s president, said business could suffer if GM\u2019s plants don\u2019t resume production soon.\n\n\u201cIf the strike goes on much longer, what started out as a very good year could turn into a mediocre year,\u201d he said.\n\nAround the country, GM dealers said inventories had grown somewhat tighter.\n\n\u201cWe had a pretty deep shelf when the strike started and are at about average inventory right now,\u201d said Mark Scarpelli, president of Raymond Chevrolet in Antioch, Illinois.\n\nGM said last week that its American dealers had 760,000 vehicles at the end of September, down 5 per cent from a year ago. That\u2019s enough to last several weeks, but dealers are nearing the time when they place orders for the brisk sales they usually see around the end of the year.\n\nBack in Dearborn, Tlaib of Phoenix Transit & Logistics is doing what he can to get trucks back on the road. He emptied five of his trailers into a warehouse, freeing them to carry parts for other companies. But that has made barely a dent in the GM inventory in his yard.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just sit down and smoke and watch the news.\u201d", "description": "GM\u2019s biggest strike in more than a decade has put thousands out of work", "authors": ["Nelson D.
