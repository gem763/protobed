With healthcare costs on the rise, and retailers looking for ways to get customers to come through their doors, merchants like Best Buy see an opportunity to expand in healthcare.\n\nBest Buy's healthcare strategy could unlock $11 billion to $46 billion in total revenue over time, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note on Monday.\n\n\"We believe Best Buy has a durable competitive advantage in senior care, its niche in the healthcare services market,\" the analysts said.\n\nWithin the next five years, Best Buy is hoping to get 5 million seniors into its programs, Asheesh Saksena, the president of Best Buy Health, said. In a presentation to investors on Wednesday, Saksena laid out how he planned to get the company there.\n\nRead more: Best Buy could have a $46 billion opportunity in healthcare. Here's how Morgan Stanley thinks the consumer-tech giant will attack the massive market.\n\nTo start, here's a look at how Best Buy's health division fits within the whole company. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said at the investor day that the company was making an effort to address people's everyday needs, like helping them communicate with one another or manage their house with the help of technology. Health, of course, is an integral part of that.\n\nBest Buy\n\nThen, Saksena spelled out the changes that have been happening in healthcare that give Best Buy the opportunity to jump in. First, he pointed to the growing market of consumer-grade health and fitness technologies. The devices and programs that fit under that umbrella make up a $50 billion market.\n\nThe brands listed on the slide, he said, are ones that Best Buy already offers, either in-store or online.\n\nBest Buy\n\nBeyond that, Saksena said the transition the healthcare system was making from being paid based on the amount of care given (often referred to as fee for service) to being paid based on how healthy it could keep people (known as value-based care) also gives Best Buy a chance to play ball by keeping people out of the hospital with its senior-focused technologies in the home.\n\nThat, combined with an emphasis on helping people age in their homes as the elderly population increases in the US, opens up a door for Best Buy.\n\nBest Buy\n\nThen Saksena got into how Best Buy planned to get into healthcare. He laid out a three-part approach.\n\nThe first, as previously mentioned, was the health-tech market. Beyond that, Saksena said he was planning to sell remote-monitoring programs to health insurers and provide a service that helps coordinate the care of seniors.\n\nBest Buy\n\nSaksena drew parallels to Best Buy's Geek Squad service, which helps people with their technical problems, both in the stores and in their homes. If the company is able to replicate that service in healthcare, it could be a big win for Best Buy's business.\n\nBut to get there, Best Buy needed to add workers with expertise in healthcare. In the past year, the company has spent $1 billion on healthcare acquisitions focused on senior care, including the emergency-device company GreatCall for $800 million and Critical Signal Technologies, a health-services company.\n\nBest Buy\n\nCombined, Best Buy is set up to hit on all three of the strategies, with GreatCall as the backbone of Best Buy's remote-monitoring strategy and CST serving as a way to coordinate patients' healthcare.\n\nThe hope with monitoring patients \u2014 in particular seniors \u2014 is that healthcare providers can catch issues with their patients sooner rather than later.\n\nSaksena showed a video in his presentation in which a lung-transplant patient wasn't going to the refrigerator as often as he used to. The change in pattern triggered GreatCall to call him up and check in, thereby learning that he didn't have an appetite. Because that could signal a bigger issue, the team was able to intervene.\n\nHere's a look at how Best Buy is monitoring the homes of seniors, with sensors in the bedroom, in the car, on the refrigerator, and in the living room.\n\nBest Buy\n\nTo pull the remote-monitoring piece of Best Buy's strategy off \u2014 as well as the care-coordination service \u2014 insurers will have to pay Best Buy to manage the health of patients. In particular, Best Buy is directing its monitoring service to the sickest patients in Medicare Advantage plans, which by its estimates, make up 11.5% of the market, driving $55 billion in spending.\n\nAbout one-third of people on Medicare, the federal health-insurance program for seniors 65 and older, is enrolled in private Medicare Advantage health plans. People can typically choose to enroll in Traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage plans when they turn 65. Either way, their health needs are largely funded by the US government.\n\nSaksena said the company \u2014 which provides the service for 1 million seniors \u2014 charged a monthly fee for each member enrolled in the service.\n\nBest Buy\n\nWithin the next five years, Saksena said, the plan is set to grow that 1 million to 5 million.\n\nAs other companies, from health systems to health insurers, look to provide similar services that take care of seniors, it remains to be seen if Best Buy will become the one to do it. But if it did, it could have a big impact on the longevity of the company.", "description": "Here are the key slides that show why Best Buy is moving into healthcare and how it plans to become embedded in helping care for seniors in the US.", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b8a592e22af360e19c6a1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
