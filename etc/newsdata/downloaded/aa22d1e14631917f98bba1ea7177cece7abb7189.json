David Mason considers: \u201cKierkegaard\u2019s struggles are inseparable from his Christianity. Auden said he was neither poet nor philosopher, but essentially a preacher, \u2018an expounder and defender of Christian doctrine and Christian conduct.\u2019 How then to read him? While I am intrigued by the character of Jesus, I do not qualify as a Christian, do not participate in the faith and its attendant rituals. So how is it I can still find Kierkegaard attractive and useful? My answer involves a poem, \u2018Leap Before You Look,\u2019 which Auden wrote in 1940, soon after arriving in the United States to begin a new life.\u201d\n\nFlamboyant French mathematician to run for mayor of Paris despite losing in the primary: \u201cAs President Emmanuel Macron prepares for one of the most important domestic battles of French politics \u2014 the fight for the mayoralty of Paris \u2014 his most doughty opponent is not Socialist incumbent Anne Hidalgo. It is a member of his own La R\u00e9publique en Marche party.\u201d\n\nEmily Holman reviews James Davison Hunter and Paul Nedelisky\u2019s Science and the Good: The Tragic Quest for the Foundations of Morality: \u201cScience and the Good stands against attempts of \u2018the new moral science\u2019 to reduce morality to evolutionary theory and to render the thorny question of how to behave a case for empirical calculation. For sociologist James Davison Hunter and philosopher Paul Nedelisky, this science assumes \u2018a world whose dominant feature is instrumental . . . and technical rationality, in which the ends of actions are pragmatic and the means are evaluated overwhelmingly in terms of results. If values intervene, they are arbitrary rather than intrinsic to the means and ends of action.\u2019 In this world, values are not unlike fairy tales, stories we may well come to cherish but whose objective grounds are nonexistent. There is little space here for the idea that something is the right thing to do, let alone the good.\u201d\n\nWill an Italian museum include Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Salvator Mundi in a show marking the 500th anniversary of the artist\u2019s death?\n\nThe King County Library System in Washington State is boycotting Macmillan e-books because of new policy: \u201cUntil this week, libraries could purchase unlimited copies of e-books (as they could for print books, audiobooks and other formats), though access was metered; in most cases, after two years, the library was required to repurchase the e-copy. When announcing the change in a memo earlier this year, Macmillan CEO John Sargeant referenced \u2018our growing fears that library lending was cannibalizing sales.\u2019 With Macmillan\u2019s new policy, libraries may now only purchase one copy of an e-book upon its original release, and may only buy additional metered copies after an eight-week waiting period.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn Commentary, Bruce Bawer skewers a bit of \u201cglobal citizen\u201d sausage and roasts it:\n\n\u201cOn September 24, Donald Trump told the United Nations General Assembly that \u2018the future does not belong to the globalists. The future belongs to the patriots.\u2019 Four days later, as if in a rebuke to his assertion, the Great Lawn in New York\u2019s Central Park was the site of the \u2018Global Citizen Festival.\u2019 This event brought together \u2018top artists, world leaders, and everyday activists to take action\u2019 (in the words of its website) and offered free tickets to \u2018Global Citizens who take a series of actions to create lasting change around the world.\u2019 Those \u2018actions\u2019 included writing tweets and signing petitions affirming their dedication to \u2018changing the world.\u2019\n\n\u201cFeaturing such entertainers as Alicia Keys and Hugh Jackman, the Global Citizen Festival was organized by a group called Global Citizen in partnership with firms such as Johnson & Johnson, Proctor & Gamble, and Cisco Technologies. Rarely have so many heavyweight corporations described their activities in such benign language: Verizon stated on the event\u2019s website that \u2018we focus our business and resources to uplift people and protect the planet.\u2019 Who knew?\n\n\u201cCovering the festival live, MSNBC hosts kept insisting\u2014between interviews with Democratic politicians and recitation of DNC talking points\u2014that it was \u2018not about politics.\u2019 Hurricane Sandy, Central American drought, and the fall of Venezuela, we were informed, were all caused by climate change. A Mexican official announced her country\u2019s new \u2018feminist foreign policy.\u2019 The head of some activist group took credit for the decline in U.S. poverty. Politicians from Norway, Barbados, and elsewhere waved their globalist credentials, while America\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris accords was cited as a sin against globalism and thus against humanity itself.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the whole event were the repeated reassurances by those onstage that everybody present was a \u2018global citizen\u2019\u2014and that this was something for which they deserved endless congratulation. Gesturing at the folks lolling around on the sunny Great Lawn, one reporter enthused over the magnificent \u2018commitment\u2019 they were making. Representative Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), calling the audience members a \u2018powerful\u2019 image of \u2018global citizenship,\u2019 was asked what, exactly, they could do to change the world. Glancing back at them lying on the grass, he enthused: \u2018They\u2019re doing it now!\u2019 To quote one MSNBC talking head: \u2018Tonight is about community, connection\u2014the world coming together!\u2019\n\n\u201cWelcome to the vapid but dangerous new world of global citizenship.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Bergamo\n\nPoem: Emily Grosholz, \u201cBlue\u201d\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
