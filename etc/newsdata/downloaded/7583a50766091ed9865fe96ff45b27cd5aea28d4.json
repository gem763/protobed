Black patients who were sicker were given equal risk scores to white people who were healthier, diverting health care resources away from Black patients in need.\n\nIn the study, researchers Zaid Obermeyer, Brian Powers, Christine Vogeli, and Sendhi Mullainathan said the bias was so significant that fixing the problem \u201cwould increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5%.\u201d\n\nAt its core, the risk-prediction tool works by inputting a person\u2019s insurance information and using their healthcare costs as a proxy for their overall health. The system uses that data to calculate a risk score, which can then determine who needs how much care. Healthcare systems then use \"high risk care management programs\" to give extra care to high-risk patients.\n\nThe problem is that insurance and healthcare systems are riddled with deep structural inequalities between Black and white patients. Black patients have always experienced problems while accessing health care, thanks to a racial wealth gap, transportation barriers, or the lack of trust between doctors and Black patients after the revelations of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. So, even though the algorithm doesn\u2019t take race into consideration directly, bias sneaks in when using cost as a proxy for health.\n\nIn an article accompanying the study, sociologist Ruha Benjamin, author of Race After Technology, points out that while cost is \"a seemingly benign choice of label\" it ends up yielding \"potentially life-threatening results.\"\n\n\u201cThe design of different kinds of systems, whether we\u2019re talking about legal systems or computer systems, can create and reinforce hierarchies precisely because the people who create them are not thinking about how social norms and structures shape their work. Indifference to social reality is, perhaps, more dangerous than outright bigotry,\u201d Benjamin said in an email.\n\nThe point is, she wrote in her article, that \"if individuals and institutions valued Black people more, they would not \u2018cost less\u2019, and thus this tool might work similarly for all.\u201d\n\nSo, while racial bias can be rooted out by shifting the variables used to manage access to healthcare access, we still need to root out those racial inequalities altogether.\n\nBy focusing on alternative labels such as health through \u201cactive chronic conditions\u201d or \u201cavoidable costs\u201d such as emergency visits, the results are dramatic: \"predicting health leads to the highest fraction of Black patients identified as high risk, predicting cost leads to the lowest, and predicting avoidable costs is somewhere in the middle,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThe study also suggests that this problem would persist no matter the type of healthcare system, public or private. Obermeyer, one of the authors involved in analyzing the algorithm\u2019s racial bias, told Motherboard that while \u201cthis [studied] population was entirely insured\u2014either good commercial insurance or Medicare\u201d the problems would \u201ccrop up anywhere\u201d due to structural inequality and differential treatment faced by people of color across the globe.\n\nIn an email to Motherboard, Obermeyer said that cooperating with the manufacturer to apply the alternative labels proposed by the researchers led to an 84 percent reduction in bias\u2014reflecting what the numbers would look like if Black people did not \u201ccost less\u201d in the eyes of a broken system.", "description": "A series of studies argue that by focusing on costs as a proxy for health, risk algorithms are ignoring the racial inequalities in healthcare access.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1fd103229ad008d98afa3/lede/1571952898780-GettyImages-1015130594.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8428xh;0xw,0.1008xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
