It\u2019s an occasion to once again look at Cohn and ask how much of him and his \u201csavage,\u201d \u201cabrasive\u201d and \u201camoral\u201d behavior is visible in the behavior of the current president. Trump, as has been well-established, learned so much from the truculent, unrepentant Cohn about how to get what he wants, and he pines for Cohn and his notorious capabilities still. Trump, after all, reportedly has said so himself, and it\u2019s now the name of this film: \u201cWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat Cohn could, and did, get away with was the very engine of his existence. The infamous chief counsel for the red-baiting, Joseph McCarthy-chaired Senate subcommittee in the 1950s, Cohn was indicted four times from the mid-\u201960s to the early \u201970s\u2014for stock-swindling and obstructing justice and perjury and bribery and conspiracy and extortion and blackmail and filing false reports. And three times he was acquitted\u2014the fourth ended in a mistrial\u2014giving him a kind of sneering, sinister sheen of invulnerability. Cohn, Tyrnauer\u2019s work reaffirms, took his sanction-skirting capers and twisted them into a sort of suit of armor.\n\nIt\u2019s the past quarter or so, though, of Tyrnauer\u2019s film that is perhaps most salient at this stage of Trump\u2019s first term. It deals with the less discussed but arguably much more trenchant lesson of Cohn\u2019s life\u2014not his decades of dark-arts untouchability but his brutal comeuppance. Cohn did not, in the end, elude the consequences of his actions. He could not, it turned out, get away with everything forever. He was a braggart of a tax cheat, and the Internal Revenue Service closed in; he was an incorrigibly unethical attorney, and he finally was disbarred; and only six weeks after that professional disgrace, six months shy of 60 years old, Cohn was dead of AIDS.\n\nNow, less than 14 months out from next year\u2019s election, with Trump facing historic legal and political peril, it\u2019s getting harder and harder not to wonder what he might or might not have gleaned from watching Cohn\u2019s wretched unraveling. Trump is beset by 29 federal, state, local and congressional investigations. Poll after poll shows he\u2019s broadly disliked. He could win reelection, obviously, but it\u2019s true, too, that he\u2019s an unusually endangered incumbent. Trump, to be sure, is not weakened by physical sickness, and he has not been pursued by prosecutors and other committed antagonists for nearly as long as Cohn was. And as powerful as Cohn was perceived to be at his peak, he was never, it almost goes without saying, the most powerful man in the world. Even so, the question looms: Will Cohn\u2019s most accomplished and attentive mentee ultimately suffer a similar fate?\n\n\u201cThe maddening thing about Cohn and Trump,\u201d Tyrnauer told me recently, \u201cis that they have this sort of Road Runner-versus-Wile E. Coyote knack, where you think the boulder is going to fall on them and crush them and they escape just in the nick of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain American romance to getting away with it. We all secretly admire the guy that can,\u201d said Jim Zirin, a former federal prosecutor who is a regular interviewee in the film and also has a book coming out next week, Plaintiff in Chief: A Portrait of Donald Trump in 3,500 Lawsuits, in which Cohn plays an unavoidably prominent role.\n\n\u201cBut I, as a lawyer, particularly,\u201d Zirin added, \u201cbelieve in justice, and I believe that at the end of the day, sooner or later, everyone has to pay for it.\u201d\n\nJust look at Cohn.\n\n\u201cWe had him. He wasn\u2019t getting out of this,\u201d Martin London, one of the lawyers who led Cohn\u2019s disbarment, tells Tyrnauer. \u201cHe was a pinned moth.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe government long had tried to take him down, \u201ca vendetta,\u201d Cohn thought, for his role with McCarthy\u2014and he had not fallen, or so much as flinched, and it had granted him, as a New York politician put it in Newsweek, a certain \u201cjugular mystique.\u201d Many came to view his checkered record as not noxious but enticing.\n\n\u201cHe was a prototypical Teflon man,\u201d Zirin writes in his book. \u201cThe more unscrupulous he became, the more his law practice grew. He was the man to see if you wanted to beat the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did whatever he wanted, and he felt he was good enough at everything to get away with it,\u201d Robert Cohen, who worked with Cohn at his firm, says in the film, \u201cand he did for a very, very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoy,\u201d according to an attorney in his office, \u201ccouldn\u2019t have given less of a shit about rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided long ago,\u201d Cohn once told Penthouse, \u201cto make my own rules.\u201d\n\nHe was acquitted in \u201964, and he was acquitted in \u201969, and he was acquitted in \u201971, all the while thumbing his nose at the feds, but Cohn\u2019s screw-you stance was a lifelong philosophy, entitlement plus boldness.\n\nHe was \u201can incredibly spoiled princeling of an only child,\u201d Cohn cousin David Lloyd Marcus told me. \u201cHe always got his way,\u201d recalled his favorite aunt. As an adult, the resting expression on his face, which was marred by a scar that ran like a scrape down the middle of his nose, was a mixture of \u201carrogant disdain\u201d and a \u201cwhipped-dog look,\u201d people observed, \u201ccaught somewhere between a pout and a challenging glare.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t pay his bills, all but daring his creditors to sue him for what he owed\u2014tailors, locksmiths, mechanics, travel agencies, storage companies, credit card companies, stationery stores, office supply stores. He didn\u2019t pay people back, \u201cfriend or foe,\u201d wrote his biographer, Nicholas von Hoffman, who reported that a captain of his yacht called Defiance \u201chad a mental map\u201d of \u201cports we couldn\u2019t go into because we owed thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t pay his taxes, either, racking up millions of dollars in liens. Taxes, he believed, went to \u201cwelfare recipients\u201d and \u201cpolitical hacks\u201d and \u201cbloated bureaucrats\u201d and \u201ccountries whose people hate our guts.\u201d He ceaselessly taunted the IRS, calling it \u201cthe closest thing we have in this country to a Nazi or Soviet-type agency\u201d\u2014subpoenas from which, he said, went straight into \u201cthe wastebasket.\u201d\n\nHe drank champagne spiked with Sweet\u2019n Low and habitually picked food off other people\u2019s plates, thinking that manners for some reason did not apply to him. He told his chauffeurs, the drivers of his Bentley and his Cadillac and his money-green Rolls-Royce, to run red lights. \u201cJust go!\u201d he would yell, reaching over to the steering wheel and pounding on the horn.\n\nHe was preening and combative, look-at-me lavish and loud. It was an act. The truth was he hated what he was\u2014a lawyer who hated lawyers, a Jewish person who hated Jewish people, and a gay person, fiercely closeted if haphazardly hidden, who hated gay people, calling them \u201cfags\u201d and expressing his conviction that \u201chomosexual teachers are a grave threat to our children,\u201d according to both his biography and autobiography. In his book, Zirin calls Cohn \u201ca quintessential hypocrite, a classic Tartuffe.\u201d He wanted the world to see only the person he \u201cshaped and invented,\u201d in von Hoffman\u2019s words, \u201ca secret man living a public life.\u201d\n\nAnd as a litigator, Cohn had earned a reputation as \u201can intimidator and a bluffer,\u201d attorney Arthur Liman would write, \u201cfamous among lawyers for winning cases by delays, evasions, and lies.\u201d He was unorganized and largely disinterested in specifics, relying less on preparation and more on his belligerence and his vast, nonpareil network of social and political connections that spanned parties and stretched from New York pay-to-play clubhouses to the backrooms of Washington as well as the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cPeople came to me,\u201d Cohn explained in Penthouse, \u201cbecause my public image was that I was unlike most other lawyers. Not the typical bill-by-the-hour, do-nothing, cover-up shyster but someone who won\u2019t be pushed around.\u201d His clients called him a \u201cpit bull\u201d and \u201ca shield\u201d and included mob bosses who met in his office to use attorney-client privilege to dodge potential wiretaps. \u201cHe\u2019ll bend the rules to the limit,\u201d a New York law professor once told Newsweek. \u201cHe will stop at nothing,\u201d a law school classmate once told Esquire.\n\nHis biographer likened him to Houdini.\n\nCohn, however, preferred a different comparison. \u201cIf you can get Machiavelli as a lawyer,\u201d he once said, \u201cyou\u2019re certainly no fool of a client.\u201d\n\nHe was roundly, practically fetishistically unapologetic, remorseless, shameless, \u201ctotally impervious to being insulted,\u201d said gossip columnist Liz Smith, living by a code of blunt, come-at-me audacity, accessible only to those unhampered by morality.\n\n\u201cHe made his legal and political career,\u201d in the estimation of the British historian Eric Hobsbawm, \u201cin a milieu where money and power override rules and law\u2014indeed where the ability to get, and get away with, what lesser citizens cannot, is what proves membership of an elite.\u201d\n\n\u201cCohn,\u201d Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Murray Kempton wrote, \u201cbrought an aura perfectly calculated to attract rich men who are not quite respectable.\u201d\n\nTrump found him irresistible.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u201cTrump,\u201d the late Wayne Barrett wrote in 1979, \u201cis a user of other users\u201d\u2014a keen, foundational insight, true then and true now. And with the exception of his father, whose fortune made possible the life he\u2019s lived, Trump used Cohn more than he used anybody.\n\nFrom 1973, when Cohn started representing the Trumps after the Department of Justice sued them for racist rental practices at the thousands of apartments they owned, through the rest of the \u201970s and into the \u201980s, when he served as an indispensable macher for Trump\u2019s career-launching maneuvers, Cohn became for Trump something much more than simply his attorney. At a most formative moment for Trump, there was no more formative figure than Cohn.\n\nTyrnauer and Zirin remind viewers and readers that Cohn imparted an M.O. that\u2019s been on searing display throughout Trump\u2019s ascent, his divisive, captivating campaign, and his fraught, unprecedented presidency. Deflect and distract, never give in, never admit fault, lie and attack, lie and attack, publicity no matter what, win no matter what, all underpinned by a deep, prove-me-wrong belief in the power of chaos and fear.\n\nTrump was Cohn\u2019s most insatiable student and beneficiary. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just educate Trump, he didn\u2019t just teach Trump, he put Trump in with people who would make Trump,\u201d Marcus, his cousin, told me. \u201cRoy gave him the tools. All the tools.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loved him,\u201d early Trump Organization executive Louise Sunshine told me.\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cHe was ruthless.\u201d\n\nSo, though, was Trump.\n\nCohn was diagnosed as HIV-positive in October 1984. He insisted his illness was liver cancer. \u201cEven at the end, he refused to admit that he was gay,\u201d Wallace Adams, one of his boyfriends, tells Tyrnauer, \u201cand he refused to admit that he had AIDS.\u201d But everybody who knew him knew. And when Cohn\u2019s feared, famed capacities started to sag, as he grew more and more weak and less and less useful, Trump began to transfer work to other attorneys. He called Cohn on occasion to express encouragement. He invited him to Mar-a-Lago for a dinner with others. But these gestures failed to paper over what some close to Cohn considered Trump\u2019s effective abandonment. \u201cDropped him like a hot potato,\u201d Cohn\u2019s secretary, Susan Bell, told me. \u201cHe really did.\u201d\n\nBy the end of 1985, Cohn was pale, frail and gaunt. His right eye was a maze of red lines. His mind wandered often, and his voice wavered to the point of a whisper. He would use one hand to stop the other from shaking. At his annual New Year\u2019s Eve party, limos double-parked outside his Upper East Side townhouse, the A-list guests ran the gamut as usual, from onetime Tammany Hall heavy Carmine DeSapio to gossip columnist Cindy Adams to celebrity artist Andy Warhol. Cohn bucked up enough to don a white dinner jacket with a red bow tie with sequins but fooled nobody. \u201cGod,\u201d thought Warhol, according to his diary, \u201che looked so sick.\u201d\n\nHis physical diminishment ran parallel to his legal jeopardy, gutting him of the wherewithal to mount the kind of fight for which he had been so vaunted. The IRS mobilized to seize the townhouse and his cottage in Greenwich, Connecticut, filing for $7 million in back taxes. Circling, too, was the New York State Bar, bringing to a head its three-year-plus disbarment proceedings based on accusations of \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation,\u201d stemming from four separate cases over the course of three decades\u2014that he didn\u2019t pay back a loan from a client until disbarment was underway, that he misappropriated escrowed property of a client, that he forged a signature on a client\u2019s will, and that he lied on his application to the Washington, D.C., bar.\n\nTrump, along with New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, TV personality Barbara Walters, attorney Alan Dershowitz, conservative columnists William Safire and William F. Buckley and others, testified on Cohn\u2019s behalf as a character witness. But in late June, Cohn was disbarred. His conduct, according to the top appellate court in the state, was \u201cunethical,\u201d \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cparticularly reprehensible.\u201d In public, he remained tough-front defiant. He called those who had made the decision a \u201cbunch of cheap politicians,\u201d a \u201cbunch of yo-yos,\u201d a \u201cbunch of nobodies.\u201d He said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less.\u201d He said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t bother me in the least.\u201d But he cared a great deal. And it bothered him a lot. He talked to law partner Thomas Bolan and cried. He knew what was coming. He wrote a will and tried to \u201cfinish it\u201d but fumbled pitifully with a bottle of pills.\n\nEarly that July, his secretary saw him just once. \u201cI had come in the front door, and he was just descending the stairs,\u201d Bell told me. \u201cAnd he was just coming down, and he had a man on either side of him helping him walk, and he was very, very thin. You could see every bone in his ugly face, and he had thrush all around his lips. And as I walked by him\u2014I had to go by him to get to the elevator\u2014he looked up at me, and he said, \u2018Hello, Sue.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, hi, Mr. Cohn.\u2019 And I got on the elevator, and I cried. And I didn\u2019t like him, but I\u2019ve never seen anybody so devastated.\u201d\n\nA month later, Cohn was dead.\n\nA crowd, his crowd, of some 400 people assembled for his memorial service at Town Hall, the landmark New York venue. Bolan and DeSapio and former mayors and borough bigwigs and businessman Bill Fugazy and Republican Senator Chic Hecht of Nevada and Rupert Murdoch and Roger Stone. And Trump. They remembered him as loyal and funny and smart. They remembered him as an anticommunist patriot with an \u201calmost insatiable interest in gossip.\u201d Bolan eulogized Cohn as a victim of \u201cthe liberal establishment,\u201d of \u201cfoes in the media,\u201d of \u201cpolitical enemies\u201d who \u201ctried to shoot him down.\u201d Fugazy said his longtime friend had \u201chopped the tables\u201d until he finally was felled. He said Cohn had \u201clived life at the edge of danger.\u201d Trump did not speak. He wasn\u2019t asked. He stood instead in the rear of the room, contemplating, perhaps, all that Cohn had done for him, and who might be able to replace him, who could build on what Cohn had bequeathed. But there was just one Roy Cohn, and Trump, even at 40, maybe more than anybody, had to know it.\n\nCohn\u2019s cousin doesn\u2019t believe in karma, but he can\u2019t help but think there is a final reckoning. \u201cYou can only outrun that fortune, and your own mistakes, and your own ego, and your own nastiness,\u201d Marcus told me, \u201cfor so long.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe open question,\u201d Tyrnauer said when we talked, \u201cis whether Trump\u2019s luck will hold up or whether\u2014like Cohn\u2014he\u2019ll run out of road and face a tsunami of legal difficulties that will diminish him or put an end to the game that he\u2019s played so effectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were all brought up to believe, whether it\u2019s an eye for an eye, it\u2019s religion, it\u2019s Greek tragedy, it\u2019s whatever, that justice is going to catch up with everybody,\u201d Zirin added. \u201cThe jury\u2019s still out on Donald Trump. We don\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll get his comeuppance.\u201d\n\nBut Tyrnauer reiterated the last lesson of Cohn.\n\n\u201cHe got away with it,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil he didn\u2019t.\u201d", "description": "The unrepentant political hitman who taught a younger Trump how to flout the rules didn\u2019t get away with it forever.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/67/6a/99e845db439b83a5335672eb9ecc/mag-kruse-cohn-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
