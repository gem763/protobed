Here is this week\u2019s question.\n\n\n\nQ. I'm looking at a property in Austin, Texas. What are the property taxes like there?\n\n\n\nA. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed extensive tax reform changes into law in June, meaning that homeowners across the state will be seeing changes to their bills, which will hopefully slow property tax growth in the future.\n\n\n\nHowever, those changes won\u2019t be reflected immediately, according to Jim Popp, a partner at the Austin, Texas-based law firm Popp Hutcheson. And it\u2019s unclear how much each individual\u2019s tax bill will change, he added.\n\n\n\nMore: Which U.S. Metro Areas Have the Lowest Property Taxes?\n\nProperties are assessed annually, and levies are charged on 100% of market value. Homeowners in Travis County, of which Austin is the largest city, pay taxes to the city of Austin and Travis County, plus the local school district, Mr. Popp said.\n\n\u201cFor somebody who lives in the city of Austin, that combined rate was about 2.25%,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn recent years, property values have risen, meaning many homeowners have seen bills increase even if rates have stayed the same or declined, he added.\n\nIn 2018, homeowners paid an average of $7,459 per year, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, a California-based data company.\n\nThe school district charged a flat rate of about 1.19% in 2018 for maintenance and operations and bonded indebtedness, and the city and county were allowed to raise the tax rates up to 8% without voter input, Mr. Popp said. If the rate increased more than 8%, voters could petition for a reduction, he said, adding it was a very rare occurrence.\n\nFrom Penta: Future Returns: Buying Municipal Bonds for Tax-Free Income\n\nBut, starting in 2020, the city and the county are limited in how much they can raise taxes, Mr. Popp said. The revenue collected by each entity will only be allowed to rise by no more than 3.5% each year. Voters have to approve any increase of over that amount.\n\nIn addition, for 2019, all school districts are required to reduce their rates by 7 cents, and in 2020 tax revenue statewide may increase by no more than 2.5%. That would put the total tax bill in 2019 at about 2.18% of the market value of a home, according to Mr. Popp.\n\nHowever, since the new city and county tax rules don\u2019t go into effect until 2020\u2014meaning it won\u2019t appear in tax bills until 2021\u2014the city of Austin and Travis County are expected to raise rates 8% in October, he said. That will impact the 2020 tax bill, but in 2019, that means homeowners will be paying about the same amount in property taxes.\n\n\n\nThis year\u2019s tax reform will have \u201cdifferent effects on individual properties,\u201d Mr. Popp added. But going forward, he\u2019s telling his clients to expect no more than a 3.5% annual increase in both county and city taxes, and a 2.5% yearly increase in school taxes, as compared to a more than 5.5% increase for each unit historically.\n\n\n\nClick to Read Tax Experts Share Answers and Advice for Readers\u2019 Pressing Tax Questions\n\nEmail your questions to editors@mansionglobal.com.
