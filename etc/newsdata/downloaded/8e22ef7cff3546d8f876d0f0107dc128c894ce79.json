For Kanye West, it is a marketing opportunity.\n\nAfter West missed a self-imposed deadline a month ago to release his latest album, the gospel-influenced \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d his fans went on high alert, tracking his every move and speculating about when, or whether, the album would ever come out. West further stoked the music and celebrity press by previewing the album at a series of public events, at which he portrayed the project as a major turning point.\n\n\u201cThis album has been made to be an expression of the gospel and to share the gospel and the truth of what Jesus has done to me,\u201d West told a Manhattan crowd late last month, after his first promised release date came and went. (To prevent leaks, fans\u2019 phones were secured in locked pouches.) \u201cWhen I think of the goodness of Jesus and all that he does for me, my soul cries out.\u201d\n\nThursday, Apple\u2019s Beats 1 online radio station broadcast a rambling two-hour interview in which West declared himself \u201cunquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time,\u201d spoke about the roots of what he said was a \u201cfull-on pornography addiction\u201d and called his dispute with Drake \u201cpainful,\u201d but barely talked about \u201cJesus Is King.\u201d West then tweeted that the album was coming at midnight \u2026 only to miss that deadline, too. (He was still working on a few songs, he said at 1:18 a.m.)\n\nAround noon on Friday, \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d his ninth LP, finally appeared on streaming services.\n\nBut the album\u2019s chaotic rollout, and West\u2019s evolving persona, may be as important as the music itself. It is the latest in a series of strange and fascinating spectacles that began three years ago with \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d \u2014 an album he first teased at a fashion event at Madison Square Garden, then tweaked and revised even after it had been released to the public.", "description": "After announcing, then missing, his deadlines, the rapper put out his ninth LP and an Imax film capturing one of the Sunday Service concerts that inspired it.", "authors": ["Ben Sisario"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/arts/25kanye/25kanye-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
