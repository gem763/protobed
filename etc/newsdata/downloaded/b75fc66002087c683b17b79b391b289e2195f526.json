Baghdadi was illusive for years, with reports of him being killed popping up occasionally as his \u201ccaliphate\u201d was destroyed by joint efforts of Iraqi, Syrian, Russian, American forces with the help of Kurdish and other militia groups.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russian MoD doubts Trump\u2019s announcement of killing ISIS chief al-Baghdadi, rejects claims it assisted US forces in op\n\n\u201cThe death of him, like bin Laden before him, was significant that it took out a very charismatic leader,\u201d said former Pentagon official Michael Maloof. Yet he expressed concern that it would \u201cgive it [IS] a fresh impetus to continue on.\u201d\n\nMiddle East expert Nicolas Davies suggests the killing as well as other raids may only inspire some people for more violence.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Syria\u2019s research has found that for instance \u2013 the study of civilians in conflict \u2013 found out that most people join one of these armed groups out of self-protection \u2013 to protect themselves, their families or their communities after their lives have been destabilized by these kinds of counter-terrorism operations or invasions of foreign forces,\u201d he argued.\n\nMaloof thinks that a lot depends on who would be the next leader, and whether he would be as charismatic and unifying because various IS fractions have different opinion on who should be the head. He even suggested that the group might unite with al-Qaeda again as the split was due to Baghdadi\u2019s personal fallout with its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nThere have been reports that Baghdadi\u2019s successor has already assumed symbolic reins over the now defunct \u201ccaliphate,\u201d however. Newsweek reported, citing a regional intelligence official, that the new terrorist-in-chief is Abdullah Qardash, the former Iraqi military officer who served under Saddam Hussein. In August, Qardash, also known under alias Hajji Abdullah al-Afari, was allegedly cherry-picked by Baghdadi to be in charge of the terrorist group\u2019s \u201cMuslim affairs.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the infamous ISIS leader\n\nThe reported death of Baghdadi comes amid an impeachment saga in the US. While the killing of the world\u2019s top warlord could help Trump \u201ctemporarily as a foreign policy victory,\u201d it is unlikely to \u201clessen the fervor of the radical Democrats\u201d to pursue impeachment proceedings, Maloof said.\n\nMoreover, \u201cthere might some arguments saying whether this all was \u201ctrumped up\u201d to throw everybody off on the impeachment thing,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhile Trump expressed gratitude to Moscow for facilitating the operation, the Russian Defense Ministry was seemingly taken aback by the US President\u2019s words, saying that it failed to register any US coalition strikes in the Idlib area at the time of the Saturday raid. The US leader\u2019s statement should be taken with a grain of salt, Davies agreed.\n\n\u201cYou know these are just gruesome macabre propaganda exercises really when they come before the cameras and announce that they\u2019ve killed \u2018the greatest terrorist in the world\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so maybe the whole thing is pure propaganda. That\u2019s entirely possible,\u201d he added.\n\nLike this story?
