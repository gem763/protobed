This in part reflects the big ramp-up in F-35 production, with deliveries set to climb to 141 next year from 91 in 2019. A final deal for the sale of more than 400 jets -- which at $35 billion would be the largest-ever military contract -- is expected in the next couple of weeks, he said.\n\nMr. Possenriede said the outlook for its Sikorsky helicopter units was improving, having been a drag on the company in recent quarters because of a downturn in demand for commercial choppers. Sikorsky is building the new presidential helicopter fleet, as well as new choppers for the Navy and the Air Force.\n\nHe said in an interview that staffing remains one of the biggest challenges, though the logjam of security clearances that has roiled the industry in recent years is clearing.\n\nHis comments came as Lockheed Martin reported forecast-beating quarterly profit and raised its full-year guidance.\n\nThe initial 2020 outlook fell just shy of analysts' expectations, and the shares -- which are up 45% so far this year -- fell slightly.\n\nProfit in the September quarter rose to $1.61 billion from $1.47 billion a year earlier, with per-share earnings climbing to $5.70 from $5.18, well above the $5.02 consensus among analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 22, 2019 14:27 ET (18:27 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
