Bixby wasn\u2019t included in any demonstrations of the Note 10\u2019s many new software tricks, productivity enhancements, and features designed with convenience in mind.\n\nIt was a remarkable exclusion from Samsung after years of trying to establish Bixby as central to Samsung\u2019s in-house software efforts and AI advancements. The absence was particularly noticeable since at this time last year, Samsung was showcasing Bixby 2.0 on stage in the very same room, listing off all the improvements it had made to the assistant\u2019s smarts and voice command processing. Surely a \u201cHey Bixby\u201d voice command could\u2019ve been squeezed into the presentation somewhere, right? It never came.\n\nThere are other signs that Bixby might be less of a priority for Samsung in 2019. Unlike its last several flagship phones, the Galaxy Note 10 does not include a dedicated Bixby button. Instead, users will be able to trigger Bixby with the power button. But you wouldn\u2019t know it, because this was never shown on stage.\n\nBy default, pressing and holding the power button will bring up Bixby \u2014 no matter how long you hold it down for. If you thought a standalone Bixby button was annoying before, this out-of-box behavior could be considered even worse. If you want to use the power button to, you know, turn the phone off, you\u2019ll have to disable Bixby altogether. There might be a power/volume button combo that lets you turn off the phone more easily (Apple does this on the iPhone X and later), but Samsung\u2019s default is going to result in more unwanted Bixby interactions and customer frustration.\n\nSo Bixby is still alive and well on phones. It\u2019s also on Samsung smartwatches, TVs, and refrigerators. But the Galaxy Home (a Bixby-powered smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod) remained absent from the keynote a year after being introduced at Barclays Center in 2018. Samsung missed the Home\u2019s April release target, and most recently the company has claimed it will ship sometime in the third quarter of this year. Maybe so, but this product is taking a long time to the point that it risks turning into Samsung\u2019s AirPower. Having remained a no-show at the Note event, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll finally hear more about the Galaxy Home at next month\u2019s IFA conference in Berlin. If nothing more is known by then, well...\n\nBixby was featured during the pre-event videos that were running in the arena even if it didn\u2019t earn a keynote mention. And in fairness, Samsung had a lot of ground to cover: in addition to hardware and buzzy industry topics like 5G, the company discussed a number of partnerships with Microsoft, Under Armour, Discord, and even the UN.\n\nDoes a lack of stage time mean Bixby is going anywhere? No, not at all. But it might indicate that Samsung\u2019s assistant is taking a back seat and will become something that\u2019s just sort of there \u2014 once you free your Note 10\u2019s power button from it, that is. The people who actually enjoy using Bixby for its deep integration with phone settings and multi-step actions will still have it at their disposal. But for everyone else, Bixby has always felt disposable. Today, it felt like Samsung got the message.\n\nOther things Samsung didn\u2019t mention on stage today:", "description": "Not once during today\u2019s Unpacked event for the new Galaxy Note 10 did anyone from Samsung say the word \"Bixby.\" Samsung\u2019s virtual assistant \u2014 positioned as an alternative to Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri \u2014 was never directly brought up.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lCtGBM-Oh8ttO3XHWIYYKtC3hY=/0x56:2040x1124/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10457665/akrales_180319_2395_0032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-07"}
