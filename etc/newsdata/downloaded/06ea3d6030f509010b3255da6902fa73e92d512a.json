There is a deal to be done here,\u201d Coveney said, adding that changes to the Withdrawal Agreement would have to achieve the same outcome of no border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s possible to do that with goodwill and energy on all sides, and I think we\u2019ll get that next week.\u201d", "description": "Negotiations to strike a new Brexit deal are not \"mission impossible\" and can succeed, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said on Friday, but any new agreement must also secure an open Irish border.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
