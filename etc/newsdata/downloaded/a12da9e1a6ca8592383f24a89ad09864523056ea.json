This is a violation of the law. Shortly thereafter, press reports began to break of a phone call by the president of the United States, calling upon a foreign power to intervene in his election.\n\nThis is a breach of his constitutional responsibilities. The facts are these. The intelligence community inspector general, who was appointed by President Trump, determined that the complaint is both of urgent concern and credible, and its disclosure, he went on to say, relates to one of the most significant and important of the director of national intelligence\u2019s responsibility to the American people.\n\nOn Thursday, the inspector general testified before the House Intelligence Committee, stating that the acting director of national intelligence barred him from disclosing the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThis is a violation of law. The law is unequivocal. \u2026 It says the DNI, director of national intelligence, shall provide Congress the full whistleblower complaint.\n\nFor more than 25 years, I\u2019ve served on the Intelligence Committee as a member, as the ranking member, as part of the Gang of Four, even before I was in the leadership. I was there when we created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2014that did not exist before 2004. I was there even earlier in the \u201990s when we wrote the whistleblower laws and continued to write them, to improve them, to ensure the security of our intelligence and the safety of our whistleblowers. I know what their purpose was, and we proceeded with balance and caution as we wrote the laws.\n\nI can say with authority the Trump administration\u2019s actions undermine both our national security and our intelligence and our protections of the whistleblowers, more than both. This Thursday, the acting DNI will appear before the House Intelligence Committee. At that time, he must turn over the whistleblower\u2019s full complaint to the committee. He will have to choose whether to break the law or honor his responsibility to the Constitution.\n\nOn the final day of the constitutional Convention in 1787, when our Constitution was adopted, Americans gathered on the steps of Independence Hall to await the news of the government our founders had crafted. They asked Benjamin Franklin: What do we have, a republic or a monarchy? Franklin replied, \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d Our responsibility is to keep it. Our public endures because of the wisdom of our Constitution, enshrined in three coequal branches of government serving as checks and balances on each other.\n\nThe actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution, especially when the president says, \u201cArticle II says I can do whatever I want.\u201d For the past several months, we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so the House can gather all of the relevant facts and consider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity \u2014 approval of articles of impeachment. And this week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed a dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\n\nTherefore, today, I\u2019m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I am directing our six committees to proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\n\nGetting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote, \u201cThe times have found us.\u201d The times found them to fight for and establish our democracy.\n\nThe times have found us today, not to place ourselves in the same category of greatness as our founders but to place us in the urgency of protecting and defending our Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. And the words of Ben Franklin, to keep our republic.\n\nI thank our chairmen \u2026 Chairman Nadler of Judiciary; Chairman Schiff of Intelligence; Chairman Engel, Foreign Affairs; Chairman Cummings of Oversight. And Chairman Cummings I\u2019ve been in touch with constantly \u2014 he\u2019s a master of so much but including inspector generals and whistleblowers. [Congressman] Richie Neal of the Ways and Means Committee. Congresswoman Maxine Waters of the Financial Services Committee. And I commend all of our members, our colleagues, for their thoughtful, thoughtful approach to all of this, for their careful statements.\n\nGod bless them, and God bless America. Thank you all.", "description": "\"The president must be held accountable.
