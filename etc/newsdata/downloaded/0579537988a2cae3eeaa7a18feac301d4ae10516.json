Price tag: $16.3 trillion. That\u2019s right, trillion \u2014 with a \u201ct.\u201d\n\nThat kind of number makes fellow Dems look like pikers. Joe Biden, for example, would only devote $1.7 trillion over 10 years for climate change. Miserly Elizabeth Warren has proposed a \u201cpaltry\u201d $2 trillion.\n\nFact is, no other hopeful comes even close to Bernie\u2019s eye-popping, all-in, 14-figure mega-tab.\n\nJust how much money are we talking about? Consider that the entire federal budget is less than $4 trillion; Bernie\u2019s Green New Deal would be more than four times that. That sure is a Green New Deal.\n\nWhere would the money come from? Not to worry, says Sanders. The plan would \u201cpay for itself over the next 15 years.\u201d\n\nHe sees evil billionaires and large corporations footing the bill through new taxes, fees and penalties. If not, of course, there\u2019s always fairy dust.\n\nThe money would go to convert the nation to \u201c100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030.\u201d It would also ensure \u201ccomplete decarbonization\u201d (whatever that is) \u201cby 2050, at the latest.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s cash, too, for all those who\u2019d lose their jobs in the fossil-fuel industry: For \u201cevery displaced worker,\u201d vows Sanders, \u201cwe will provide five years of a wage guarantee, housing assistance, job training, health care [and] pension support.\u201d How thoughtful.\n\nAs for cheaper, more realistic ways to cut down on carbon, Sanders wants none of it: His plan bans new nuclear-power plants in pursuit of 100 percent \u201csustainable\u201d energy.\n\nsee also Bernie Sanders unveils $16 trillion climate plan Bernie Sanders released a climate plan on Thursday that would...\n\nNo \u201cfalse solutions, like nuclear, geoengineering, carbon capture and sequestration, or trash incinerators\u201d for him, he says.\n\nIt\u2019s classic Bernie: Propose something so radical it makes you look bold and serious \u2014 even if it\u2019s so out-of-touch that no one can actually take it seriously.\n\nHis timing\u2019s good, too: The plan comes just as Democratic voters may be looking for a new climate-change champ, now that Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee has quit the race.\n\nAnd remember: Climate change isn\u2019t the only area where Sanders vows to spend other people\u2019s money by the planet-load. His Medicare-for-All plan, for example, would run, by some estimates, as much as $40 trillion. That\u2019s 10 times the US budget.\n\nNo doubt, Sanders will lock up the Spend-Till-You-Drop vote. Democrats looking for someone more serious, on the other hand, might want to look elsewhere.", "description": "If Democrats pick their 2020 nominee based on how much cash they\u2019d spend, Bernie Sanders\u2019s got the primary sewn up.\nOn Thursday, the Vermont senator...", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "August"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/election_2020_bernie_sanders_climate.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"}
