Shirtless male students with painted faces and cheerleaders in skirts with pompoms cheered in front of the band. The sun set behind the town\u2019s water tower, which is painted with the football team\u2019s block \u201cD\u201d logo. And the announcer bellowed the traditional call \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s Friday night in Damascus!\u201d \u2014 as the Swarmin\u2019 Hornets stormed the field to play Einstein.\n\nIt felt like old times for a football-proud community, yet this was the first time the team was back on its home field after a sexual assault made national headlines and led to an administrative overhaul at the school. Damascus has a new principal, athletic director and junior varsity football coach and is under probationary oversight by Montgomery County Schools as part of the fallout from last year\u2019s horrific case, in which members of the junior varsity team were accused of sexually assaulting several teammates with a broomstick in the locker room.\n\nOne key administrator who remains in place is longtime varsity coach Eric Wallich, a decision that has invited scrutiny from some in the community while also drawing robust support from others who believe Wallich and the football team have been cast in an unfair light. His teams have maintained the backing of their powerful booster club and the town\u2019s youth football organization, yet even those supporters have grappled with a central question: How does this football-loving town move on without forgetting?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think the community learned a lot of lessons and had a good long look at itself after,\u201d said Ed O\u2019Brian, a Damascus football parent who is also the booster club\u2019s membership coordinator. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong; there\u2019s people in the community who want to see the football team shut down \u2026 but all you would do is punish 55 to 100 kids who did nothing.\u201d\n\nA football locker room, a broomstick and a sex assault case roil a school\n\nThe school has not lost any boosters because of the scandal, according to O\u2019Brian \u2014 the booster club is still the largest and most active in Montgomery County, with several hundred members \u2014 but Wallich and the community are bracing for the impact of an ongoing external review of the school\u2019s reporting practices and supervision of athletics and extracurricular activities, which is being conducted by law firm WilmerHale and is expected to be released in the coming weeks. The firm will be paid up to $250,000 for its work.\n\nThe football team will remain under probationary oversight for a year after last year\u2019s assault on Halloween, when several junior varsity players pinned down teammates and sexually assaulted them with a broomstick in the locker room, which was unsupervised for a 25-minute window that afternoon before the team\u2019s final practice of the season. Four players were charged with first-degree rape; each suspect was originally charged as an adult, but each later had his case transferred to juvenile court. The suspects and victims were all 14 or 15 at the time.\n\nEach of the suspects has pleaded to being involved in the attacks, but because juvenile hearings have not been opened for the full proceedings, it is not clear what charges the teens have pleaded to or what punishment or rehabilitation recommendation each of the defendants face.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe fallout at Damascus was swift last spring, when former principal Casey Crouse stepped down from her post and took a job in the school system\u2019s central office. Former athletic director Joe Doody and former junior varsity coach Vincent Colbert were replaced. The county announced in May that Wallich would be retained.\n\nAll four of the adults were informed of the assaults on the night they occurred; Colbert spoke with Wallich, who passed information about the alleged assault to the athletic director and to Crouse, according to a group text message seen by The Washington Post. None called the police that night; The Post reported in March that school officials waited more than 12 hours to tell police about credible allegations that at least one player had been sexually assaulted with a broomstick.\n\nWallich declined to be interviewed for this story, writing in an email: \u201cI\u2019m not doing interviews with certain media including [The Post]. I lost respect for just about everyone during this media coverage last year. We have moved on and turned the page. I\u2019m done discussing the past.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe traditions of Damascus were ever-present in its 37-0 win over Einstein in the home opener, in which Wallich coached with his typical vigor in front of a packed crowd that wouldn\u2019t leave until the final whistle. Behind Wallich and in front of the student section stood new principal Kevin Yates, who was appointed in July after having taken over for Crouse on an interim basis in May. Roaming the sidelines was Elgin, hired in May to replace Doody.\n\n\u201cEric, he had a tough year, too,\u201d Elgin said of Wallich. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can to make sure they get what they need and that everything is being done correctly, with the supervision. We\u2019re checking in on all our programs. That\u2019s a countywide thing. That\u2019s just not Damascus.\u201d\n\nThere are some less convinced that the county has done enough to address the issues, and whether Wallich should still be the coach. WilmerHale, which has been investigating the school since April, is examining more than the 2018 incident and set out to review any other reports of sexual assault, bullying or hazing within the athletic department since 2017.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMontgomery County Schools officials have not commented on the decision to retain Wallich. The county\u2019s athletic director, Jeffrey Sullivan, declined to be interviewed.\n\n\u201cI know there have been calls for shutting down the whole program for a year, taking a break, wiping out all of the coaches and starting over,\u201d said Janis Sartucci, an activist with the Parents\u2019 Coalition of Montgomery County. \u201cAnd I think that goes to the question we see in all of these institutions where this has been an issue: Can there be real change if the same decision-makers are left in place? That\u2019s always the problem.\u201d\n\nDamascus has long been considered one of Maryland\u2019s most prominent high school football teams. The school\u2019s 10 state championships \u2014 all won after 1981 \u2014 are tied for second most in the state\u2019s history, and the school has consistently featured some of the D.C. area\u2019s top college prospects. This year\u2019s team features the top-rated recruit in the country, defensive lineman Bryan Bresee, who has committed to defending national champion Clemson.\n\nUnder the direction of Wallich, who graduated from Damascus in 1990 and became the head coach in 2008, the varsity team won a Maryland-record 53 straight games and three consecutive state titles from 2015 to 2017. That winning streak was believed to be the longest in the country before it was snapped with a loss to Oakdale in the state playoffs on a frigid Friday night in November, just 18 days after the sexual assault.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile other Montgomery County high school teams must fend off private school recruiting, Damascus has restocked talent consistently through its own pipeline: the Damascus Sports Association youth program.\n\n\u201cMost youth football organizations, their numbers are dwindling. And we\u2019re not. Damascus is very proud, old tradition,\u201d said Adam Cooley, the commissioner of the Damascus Sports Association. \u201cWe\u2019ve done what we\u2019ve done, supported the victims. \u2026 It\u2019s been tough, but we\u2019ve all kind of come together as a family. It\u2019s a big, giant football community.\u201d\n\nElgin watched that new community come together for the first home game last month and tried to keep it running as smoothly as possible. He grew up in Montgomery County, served as an assistant athletic director at Clarksburg and understands the history of the Damascus program, but to be a part of it on the first home game of the season was a wholly different experience. He stood on the field after the victory, near the kneeling players who listened to Wallich give his customary postgame speech.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEventually, Wallich was greeted by his family on the field, and his players celebrated as they ran back to the locker room. It was almost the end of another Friday night in Damascus, yet some are still grappling with the idea of moving on from last year\u2019s events.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re just ready to move on from it,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cI think people still have it in their minds. Most of these kids will until they\u2019re out of the school.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nOutside investigation of Damascus High sexual assault case takes longer than expected\n\nCases wind down for teens charged in Damascus High School locker room attacks\n\nDamascus football forced to forfeit first game after holding illegal practice\n\nAD", "description": "Game days \u2014 and the head coach \u2014 remain the same at this Maryland high school football powerhouse, as the community tries to move on but not forget.", "authors": ["Roman Stubbs", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V_h2dkiWajvrO6tdMc5mdHzxkI4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RY6VLSHCOUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg"}
