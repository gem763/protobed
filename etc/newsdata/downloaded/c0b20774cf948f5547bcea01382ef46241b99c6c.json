It has been held in one of the museum's collections since.\n\nDr Darby was studying this collection when he came across the then-nameless species.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Greta Thunberg has led a global climate protest movement, Fridays For Future\n\nBy naming the beetle after Ms Thunberg, he said, he \"wanted to acknowledge her outstanding contribution in raising awareness of environmental issues\".\n\nIt has now been formally named in the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine.\n\nDr Max Barclay, the museum's senior curator in charge of beetles, said the name was apt because \"it is likely that undiscovered species are being lost all the time, before scientists have even named them, because of biodiversity loss\".\n\n\"So it is appropriate to name one of the newest discoveries after someone who has worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species,\" he added.\n\nWho else has an animal named after them?\n\nFor scientists, naming a newly-discovered species after themselves is simply not done - which means they need to be a bit more creative.\n\nThis is how we now have a parasite named after Bob Marley (Gnathia marleyi), a genus of fish called after Richard Dawkins (Dawkinsia), and a small park's worth of species - both alive and extinct - named after Sir David Attenborough.\n\nSometimes animals are named after celebrities the scientists admire, as with the N. gretae beetle, or a spider called Spintharus leonardodicaprioi.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption John Cleese is a big fan of lemurs - although this particular species isn't named after him\n\nOther times, it's because the celebrity is known to have a particular fondness for that animal - as with the lemur named after John Cleese, Avahi cleesei.\n\nAnd sometimes the animals bear some resemblance to the celebrity they're named after.\n\nFor example, there is a golden-haired fly named after Beyonce - Scaptia beyonceae. There is also a moth called Neopalpa donaldtrumpi which, biologist Vazrick Nazari said in 2017, is known for its distinctive blonde head and \"comparatively small\" genitals.\n\nAnd just last year, Donald Trump had another animal named after him - an amphibian that buries its head in the sand. The Dermophis donaldtrumpi was so named because of the US president's comments about climate change.\n\nUnlike when you name a pet, however, scientific names last forever.\n\nThere is perhaps no starker warning of the dangers of this than the Anophthalmus hitleri, a blind cave beetle doomed to forever be named after Adolf Hitler by a German admirer in 1933.", "description": "The nelloptodes gretae - named after the teenage climate activist - is less than 1mm long.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F24/production/_109367830_ngretae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
