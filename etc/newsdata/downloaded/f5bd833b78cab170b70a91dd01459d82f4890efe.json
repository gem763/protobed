They employed it to marvel at the baffling behaviors of white folks, like a predilection for pumpkin spice anything. Over time, it became widely used internet shorthand for the ways in which white entitlement, flagrant displays of privilege and exceptions that eluded other groups weave their way through our society.\n\nThe thing about caucacity is that there are levels to it, and it is safe to say we are at an all-time high. Take, for example, everything about Elizabeth Holmes. The college admissions scandal. The desire to blame anything other than racism for the terror of the El Paso shooting.\n\nCaucacity isn\u2019t just something for Desus, Mero and their fans to process alone anymore. Lately, I\u2019ve been noticing a steady stream of cultural properties addressing whiteness \u2014 either head on, as in the case of the period drama \u201cThe Nightingale,\u201d or sideways, with a surrealist, abstract bent, as in the horror tale \u201cMidsommar,\u201d both made by white filmmakers.\n\nAnd what a relief. As a friend put it to me recently, \u201cThis is white people\u2019s job now,\u201d meaning that it\u2019s time for white people to start helping one another see themselves in terms of their race and all the undeserved, inherited privilege that comes with it. It\u2019s a self-examination that knows the difference between \u201cwoke\u201d and self-awareness, and leans toward the latter. It\u2019s not easy work. \u201cWhite progressives can be the most difficult for people,\u201d Robin DiAngelo writes in her groundbreaking book, \u201cWhite Fragility,\u201d because she and others \u201cdo indeed uphold and perpetuate racism, but our defensiveness and certitude make it virtually impossible to explain to us how we do so.\u201d", "description": "Movies as different as \u201cThe Nightingale,\u201d \u201cMidsommar\u201d and \u201cThe Last Black Man in San Francisco\u201d are all processing the legacy of privilege.", "authors": ["Jenna Wortham"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/arts/01whiteness1/01whiteness1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
