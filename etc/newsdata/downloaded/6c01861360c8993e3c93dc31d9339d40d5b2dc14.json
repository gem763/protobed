I shouldn't have done it.\n\n\"I should have known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognise it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Justin Trudeau told reporters: \"I should have known better, but I didn't\"\n\nWhen asked if there had been other occasions, Mr Trudeau told reporters that he also wore make-up while performing at a talent show in high school.\n\nAn image from that incident has since been posted to Twitter.

The wearing of blackface/brownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism and an Orientalist mythology which is unacceptable.\n\nThe council added that it recognised that \"people can change and evolve over two decades\", but said Mr Trudeau must \"immediately and unequivocally\" apologise.\n\nLater, the council issued a tweet thanking him for apologising promptly.\n\nAndrew Scheer, leader of the opposition Conservatives, said the picture was racist in 2001 and racist now.\n\n\"What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a total lack of judgement and integrity and someone who is not fit to govern this country,\" he said.\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, a Sikh, said the image was \"troubling\" and \"insulting\".\n\n\"Anytime we hear examples of brownface or blackface, it's making a mockery of someone for what they live and what their lived experiences are,\" Mr Singh told journalists on the campaign trail in Toronto.\n\nThe image was also criticised in a tweet by Green Party leader Elizabeth May.\n\nOpinion polls indicate that October's election will be a tough race for Mr Trudeau who is seeking a second term in office.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Four years of Justin Trudeau in two minutes\n\nHis campaign got off to a bad start after his plane was grounded by a scraped wing on the first day.
