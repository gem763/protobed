The department already collects social media information from immigrants as well as from some foreign visitors.\n\nThe plan would also be a violation of Twitter's rules. Twitter says it's still reviewing the new Homeland Security policy.", "description": "Federal agency lets employees create phony online accounts to monitor people trying to enter the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/03/f045ff43-3a1c-4156-839b-8679b3300824/thumbnail/1200x630/6dbf2eab9ae280dd2a06a23e42b54da1/fix-gettyimages-944207404.jpg"}
