The answers aren\u2019t coming easy right now.\n\nAfter a third consecutive anemic offensive showing led to an 8-1 blowout loss to the Washington Nationals in Game 3 Monday night, the St. Louis Cardinals are staring down a 3-0 deficit in the NL Championship Series and are one loss from being swept in the best-of-seven playoff.\n\nSt. Louis scored one unearned run on seven hits and has a total of two runs on 11 hits through three games. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, and now the Cardinals are on the brink of elimination going into Game 4 on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t scored,\u201d said Goldschmidt, who struck out four times in Game 3. \u201cWe haven\u2019t executed as an offense. I haven\u2019t really done anything this series, and the results speak for themselves, especially tonight. Just have to do a better job.\u201d\n\nTime is running out to turn things around.\n\nThrough the first two games of the series, pitching, defense and baserunning helped keep the Cardinals competitive. When all those elements abandoned them and the hitting never showed up Monday, it added up to a devastating defeat in front of 43,675 fans eager for the first World Series in Washington since 1933.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be down 3-0,\u201d second baseman Kolten Wong said. \u201cWe know how good we are, and we know how good they are. In the season we played them and we\u2019ve handled them pretty well. To come into this situation and just be where we\u2019re at, we expected better, but it\u2019s baseball.\u201d\n\nA comedy of errors in the field and on the basepaths and a rare off night for 23-year-old ace Jack Flaherty did little to relieve the pressure of a lineup still flummoxed by Nationals pitching.\n\nManager Mike Shildt opted not to shake up a lineup that had gone cold since a 13-run outburst in the clinching Game 5 of the NLDS at Atlanta, changing out only Matt Carpenter for Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez. That didn\u2019t work: Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg mowed down the Cardinals with 12 strikeouts and zero walks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys where when he\u2019s on, you\u2019ve got to really figure out ways to just scratch, claw and get on base,\u201d Wong said.\n\nThe Cardinals didn\u2019t do much of that.\n\nBeyond Goldschmidt\u2019s four Ks, leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and Marcell Ozuna struck out twice. When Ozuna doubled leading off the second inning, he stunted the momentum with a baserunning blunder that set the tone for the rest of the night.\n\nWith little developing at the plate and the Cardinals\u2019 margin for error razor thin, each mistake \u2014 like Ozuna missing a catchable ball in left field in the third inning \u2014 became more demoralizing.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our cleanest game,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cGot called off at second base trying to move a runner \u2014 could have gotten the lead at that point, trying to make a play. Not our cleanest game. \u2026 The Ozuna play, but that\u2019s not exactly a play you can expect a guy to make when he leaves his feet.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the starting pitching that kept St. Louis close in the first two games wasn\u2019t at the same level.\n\nAfter going 18 consecutive starts without allowing more than three runs, Flaherty surrendered four on four hits in the third inning alone. He then started off the fourth by giving up Kurt Suzuki\u2019s first hit of the playoffs and didn\u2019t make it to the fifth.\n\n\u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t execute to (Howie) Kendrick right there,\u201d Flaherty said of the two-run double he gave up in the third. \u201cIt just comes down to execution.\u201d\n\nBy the time Shildt turned to his bullpen \u2014 to fittingly terrible results \u2014 it was difficult to envision the Cardinals scoring enough runs to even make it interesting. The crushing combination of no hitting and flawed play all over the field put St. Louis on the brink of elimination with 25-year-old Dakota Hudson going to the mound trying to extend this season one more day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go out there and try to do anything that\u2019s out of my skillset,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI just want to give the best I have and stay within myself to where I have the best chance of success.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Paul Goldschmidt shook his head and blamed himself.
