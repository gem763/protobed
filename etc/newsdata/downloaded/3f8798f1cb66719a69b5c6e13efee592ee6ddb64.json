Your youngest forgot to mention their spelling test on Tuesday. Your eldest hasn\u2019t finished their report on the Second World War \u2014 and it\u2019s due tomorrow.\n\nAs you enter a screaming match and then attempt to scramble something together, you can\u2019t help but wonder: is homework really worth it?\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. More than a third of parents don\u2019t believe their primary school-aged child should be doing homework, according to the 2017 Ofsted Parents Panel Annual Report. And Telegraph columnist Judith Woods argues that homework puts families under undue stress.\n\nBut does it actually help? Are the family rows worth it because it helps children get ahead? We asked education experts to find out whether homework has merit.\n\nDeveloping independence\n\nAs well as helping to consolidate what a child has learnt in class, homework is \u201cpart and parcel of developing independent learning,\u201d according to Edward Balfour, headteacher at Beechwood Park School.\n\nBy setting challenging work that will \u201cgently push children out of their comfort zone\u201d, you prepare them for the future, as this \u201chelps towards developing independence and confidence in young children in preparation for adulthood\u201d.\n\nWhile often considered a teacher-led activity, Balfour adds that \u201chomework can be a liberation of pupils\u201d as it allows them to \u201cdemonstrate their flair and their ingenuity, their creativity and their character\u201d.\n\nIndeed, there has been a shift away from typical homework assignments in early education, according to Christopher King, chief executive of The Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS). \u201cI think that the more enlightened schools are moving away from homework in the traditional form, which often one felt was actually created for parents rather than the child, to something which is more effective \u2014 such as regular reading.\u201d\n\nOne such primary school that has implemented this new style of homework is Littletown Primary Academy in Honiton, which changed its homework policy last year. Now, instead of formal English and maths homework, children are expected to do 20 minutes of reading each evening and are given a list of optional activities each term, related to a topic they are studying.\n\nThis more laid-back approach has encouraged pupils\u2019 independent learning, according to the school\u2019s headteacher David Perkins. \u201cIt transfers the ownership back to the child and that\u2019s a really powerful thing to do.\u201d.\n\nImpact on lessons\n\nFor homework to be effective, it has to cater to all the pupils in the classroom. The \u201cskilled teacher\u201d will be able to \u201cprovide a task which has a number of different approaches to it, which will suit different learners,\u201d Balfour says.\n\nThis is easier said than done, according to Perkins \u2014 especially if there is a range of abilities in the classroom. \u201cTo actually get it spot-on for each child is an inordinate amount of workload, and I\u2019d rather have my teachers applying that focus somewhere else.\u201d\n\nSetting and marking homework can put extra pressure on teachers and \u201cat its worst extremes, it can actually deflect from the preparation of more imaginative lessons that engage the children in the classroom,\u201d according to King.\n\nFamily life\n\n\u201cWhat I think should be banned is setting homework for homework\u2019s sake,\u201d King says, as this is \u201cnot helpful and does bring stress to the family\u201d.", "description": "It\u2019s Sunday night and it's chaos.", "authors": ["Katie Russell", "Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez", "Zoe Strimpel", "James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/09/25/TELEMMGLPICT000154488508-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbNWtAZp4M83CNbYcU41Ja5PBtShq1Cx9HGnISD2SOrk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
