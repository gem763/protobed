For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Coming off his first loss since May in the World Series opener, Gerrit Cole wasn\u2019t going to let lightning strike twice.\n\nCole looked every bit the dominant starter he was during the regular season, allowing one run over seven innings Sunday night to lead the Houston Astros to the brink of their second World Series title in three years.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 7-1 victory over the Washington Nationals in Game 5 gave them a three games-to-two advantage and continued the streak of the visiting team winning every game in this year\u2019s World Series.\n\n\u201cI hope I go home with nothing left in the tank,\u201d Cole said on Saturday before Game 4. \u201cSo whether it's tomorrow is the last time I pitch or I get the opportunity to pitch another time after that, I just hope I'm just absolutely dog tired by the time I get home.\u201d\n\nCole certainly gave it his best effort, throwing 110 pitches, striking out nine and walking two.\n\nGAME 5: Nationals on the ropes with third straight loss\n\nTRUMP: Crowd in Washington was ready for President's arrival\n\nAn eagerly awaited rematch of Game 1 aces \u2013 which the Nationals won 5-4 \u2013 never materialized when Max Scherzer was scratched because of back and neck spasms. In his place, the Nationals turned to Joe Ross \u2013 who wasn\u2019t even on the roster for any of their other postseason series.\n\nRoss pitched well enough under the circumstances, making only two major mistakes in five innings of work. But those mistakes were big ones. Yordan Alvarez hit a two-run homer in the second inning and Carlos Correa added another two-run blast in the fourth to give Cole more than enough offensive support, before George Springer put the game out of reach with a two-run homer of his own in the ninth.\n\nAfter dropping the first two games of the Series at home, the Astros looked much more like the 107-win team they were in the regular season. In the three games played in Washington, Houston never trailed at any point.\n\nThe Nationals, meanwhile, failed to generate any offense for a third consecutive game. Juan Soto\u2019s solo home run off Cole in the seventh accounted for all their scoring. And their offense continued to struggle in key situations. With an 0-for-2 showing in those run-producing opportunities in Game 5, the Nats were 1-for-21 (.048) in their three games at home.\n\nThe Astros will have two chances to close out the series as the two teams return to Houston for Game 6 on Tuesday and Game 7, if needed, on Wednesday.\n\nGerrit Cole bounced back from his loss in Game 1 with a stellar showing in Game 5.

The Astros\u2019 regular DH after being called up in June showed just why he\u2019s the odds-on favorite for AL Rookie of the Year honors \u2013 playing a central role in Houston taking the early lead.\n\nWith a runner on first in the second inning, Alvarez drilled a 95 mph sinker from Ross 405 feet into the first row of the center field bleachers to give the Astros an early 2-0 lead.\n\nYordan Alvarez off RHP Joe Ross - 106.4 mph, 19 degrees (405 ft Home Run)\n\n95.2 mph Sinker#Astros @ #Nationals (T2) pic.twitter.com/9Q5JfdlXk9 \u2014 MLBBarrelAlert (@MLBBarrelAlert) October 28, 2019\n\nThen in the fourth, with Ross still on the mound, Alvarez lashed a two-out laser down the right field line for a single. He scored when the next batter, Carlos Correa, deposited a Ross sinker into the seats in left field to make it 4-0.\n\nAlvarez also added another single in the seventh inning before being taken out for defensive purposes.\n\nManager\u2019s special\n\nNationals skipper Dave Martinez was in a no-win situation with his pitching staff from the moment Scherzer couldn\u2019t get out of bed. The Nationals had the worst bullpen ERA in the majors this season (5.66) and he had to use four relievers to finish up an 8-1 loss the previous night.\n\nCole may have foiled any countermoves Martinez could have made anyway, but his decision to allow Ross to hit for himself in the bottom of the third inning with the Nats trailing 2-0 may have been the only button he could have pushed but didn\u2019t in an effort to generate some offense.\n\nPresidential appearance\n\nDuring every home game, the Nationals have a tradition of saluting the region\u2019s many members of the armed services by having fans wave their caps. As the cameras panned the crowd, one showed President Trump in one of the stadium luxury boxes.\n\nThe cheers turned to loud boos.\n\nBefore the fourth inning began, a chant broke out from the crowd: \u201cLock him up! Lock him up!\u201d\n\nObviously, Nats fans can\u2019t stand the thought of Anthony Rendon leaving as a free agent this winter and want him locked up with a long-term deal.\n\nState of the series\n\nThe World Series heads back to Houston for Game 6 on Tuesday night with the Astros looking to secure the franchise\u2019s second championship.\n\nThe homestanding Astros will send Justin Verlander to the mound against Stephen Strasburg of the Nationals.\n\nDespite his many career accomplishments, Verlander has never been the winning pitcher in a World Series game. In six previous Fall Classic starts, Verlander has an unruly 5.73 ERA over 33 innings. He allowed four runs and seven hits over six innings and took the loss against the Nationals in Game 2.\n\n\u201cI think there's adjustments both ways,\u201d Verlander said, looking ahead to the rematch. \u201cBut I think those opposing guys once they've seen you three, four at-bats, it's a little bit easier for them to make adjustments, and having seen your off-speed stuff and tracked it. You just need to execute a little bit better.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Strasburg is building a case as one of the game\u2019s best playoff pitchers. He\u2019s won all four of his starts this postseason with a 1.93 ERA, including his one appearance in relief.\n\n\u201cPitching at this point in the season, it's a tremendous honor,\u201d Strasburg said before Game 4, \u201cI'm going to go out there and compete and give it everything I have.\u201d", "description": "Houston won all three games in Washington after dropping the first two and are now one win away from their second title in three years.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
