I never had full awareness or answers about this condition.\"\n\nThank you, @selenagomez, for your tenacious work toward eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health and for warmly receiving the numerous attendees at our annual dinner this past Friday who wanted to share their story with you. #DeconstructingStigma #mentalhealthawareness pic.twitter.com/VnW8tOMMEq \u2014 McLean Hospital (@McLeanHospital) September 15, 2019\n\nGomez, who last year checked herself into a facility for mental health treatment, says, \"After a year of a lot of intense work ...
