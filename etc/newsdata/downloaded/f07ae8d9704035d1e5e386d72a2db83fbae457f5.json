REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo\n\n\u201cRegarding the Spanish economy, the latest data point to a gradual weakening of activity,\u201d Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos told a conference, adding that Spain\u2019s long-running political stalemate could weigh on economic prospects unless a Nov. 10 election produces a strong government.\n\n\u201cWe cannot rule out the possibility that the uncertainty about the future course of some internal economic policies ... or recent events in Catalonia, may also have a negative impact, if they persist over time, on the spending decisions of private agents,\u201d de Cos said.\n\nCatalonia has been convulsed by almost two weeks of mass, sometimes violent, pro-independence rallies since nine politicians and activists were jailed on Oct. 14 for up to 13 years for their role in a failed secession bid in 2017.\n\nMany shops in downtown Barcelona have been shut during the rallies and there are growing concerns in Spain\u2019s tourism capital about the impact of the unrest on business.\n\nThe Catalonia crisis has also further complicated the country\u2019s fragmented political environment, just as Spain is preparing for its fourth election in as many years after having been without a proper government or budget for months.\n\n\u201cIt is urgent that the government emerging from the election has the initiative and enough support to carry out reforms to tackle the vulnerabilities that still exist in the Spanish economy and to increase its capacity for growth,\u201d de Cos said, calling for \u201ca broad consensus\u201d among the political parties.\n\nMost opinion polls point to a stalemate after the Nov.10 election, with no clear majority in sight.\n\nThe economy has largely been immune to Spain\u2019s political woes, steadily exceeding the euro zone\u2019s average growth rate over the past few years, but its expansion has slowed of late.\n\nSpain\u2019s caretaker government earlier this month forecast gross domestic product (GDP) would increase 2.1% this year, down from its previous forecast of 2.2%, and slow to 1.8% in 2020.\n\nThe Spanish economy also faced additional risk factors such as Brexit and global trade tensions, de Cos said.", "description": "Unrest in Spain's wealthiest region of Catalonia and any further political uncertainty could affect private sector investment decisions, posing another potential risk to the economy, the head of the central bank said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Emma Pinedo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446183993&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S102", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
