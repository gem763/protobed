That was supposed to rebut President Donald Trump\u2019s mocking of the Massachusetts senator as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d but only intensified it.\n\nLast month, Warren offered a public apology to Native Americans, trying to show that the issue won\u2019t be a political drag on her White House campaign, which polls show on the rise lately.\n\nThe Comanches, who are holding their 28th annual Nation Fair Powwow, are a Plains Indian tribe of about 17,000 enrolled members, with headquarters just north of Lawton, in southwest Oklahoma. Powwows are important social events for many tribes, featuring traditional dance, songs, food, regalia and other customs, and Sunday\u2019s was held at the tribe\u2019s headquarters in the foothills of the Wichita Mountains.\n\nSanders, a Vermont senator, won Oklahoma\u2019s 2016 Democratic primary over Hillary Clinton. The state votes next year as part of the earlier and expanded \u201cSuper Tuesday,\u201d which comes on March 3 and includes neighboring Texas.\n\nUniversity of Oklahoma political science professor Keith Gaddie said Sanders\u2019 powwow visit was unusual because the tribe, while well-known, is not a particularly large Native American nation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason, in order to win the state, that you\u2019d have to go down to that event,\u201d Gaddie said.\n\nWarren has made her family\u2019s down-home, financial struggles after her father had a heart attack and couldn\u2019t work \u2013 forcing her mother to get a minimum wage job \u2013 a central theme of her campaign. She and Sanders are friends who agree on many policy issues, including the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d universal health insurance plan.\n\nBoth also have refused to attack one another politically, ducking questions about whether they eventually will have to compete for the Democratic Party\u2019s most liberal wing. But a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released Saturday showed Warren outpacing Sanders in Iowa, which launches the 2020 Democratic nominating contest on Feb. 3, and running about even with former Vice President Joe Biden, who had been the crowded field\u2019s front runner.\n\nStephanie Landeros, a Comanche Indian from nearby Apache, said she felt proud Sanders picked a Native American event near her hometown.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen a presidential candidate here,\u201d Landeros said. \u201cOklahoma, sure, but never the Comanche Nation Fair.\u201d\n\nLanderos said she supports Sanders because of his position on issues that are important to her, like civil rights, protecting the environment and programs for the poor.\n\n\u201cHe seems to be someone who is concerned about minorities.\u201d\n\nSanders also attended a rally at the University of Oklahoma before speaking at the powwow.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is on tap to address the largest annual gathering of the Comanche Nation in the state where one of his main rivals, Elizabeth Warren, was born", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Sean Murphy", "Will Weissert"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/Election_2020_Bernie_Sanders_07521.jpg-8e630_c0-120-3394-2098_s1770x1032.jpg?19477ec0b9ade3b27df695146566414a545bf6dc", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
