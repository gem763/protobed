Pete Sessions\u2019 climb back into Congress was already off to a rough start, with some in his own party suggesting he was carpetbagging by leaving the Dallas district he lost last fall to try to get elected in a far more rural and politically safe one.\n\nNow he may have bigger problems: a federal indictment that appears to link him to a campaign finance scheme and the Ukraine scandal at the heart of the impeachment investigation.\n\nSessions spent 22 years in Congress becoming a powerful Republican voice and the muscle behind the GOP\u2019s House takeover of 2010. But Texas\u2019 shifting demographics saw his once reliably red district become a tossup, and Sessions lost in November to Democrat Colin Allred, a former NFL linebacker.\n\nLast week, Sessions announced an attempted comeback in his boyhood hometown of Waco, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Dallas, running for a seat being vacated by Rep. Bill Flores, one of six Texas GOP congressmen retiring next year.\n\nWhat looked like a veteran Republican seeking greener pastures as the party increasingly loses support in cities and surrounding suburbs even in fiercely conservative Texas got further complicated Thursday, when two Florida businessmen tied to Rudy Giuliani and the Ukraine impeachment investigation were charged with federal campaign finance violations relating to a $325,000 donation to a group supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nBoth men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are Soviet-born, and Sessions said Friday that they had been past campaign contributors of his. In a statement Friday, he said he was donating what they gave him to \u201ccharities that serve abused women and children and the elderly in Central Texas.\u201d\n\nProsecutors allege that Parnas urged a congressman to seek the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the behest of Ukrainian government officials. That happened about the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician.\n\nThe indictment does not accuse Sessions of wrongdoing or mention him by name, simply referring to the person as \u201cCongressman 1.\u201d But donations made by Parnas and Fruman match campaign finance reports for Sessions.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s got Ukraine wrapped around his axle now adds to the steepness of the climb,\u201d Flores, the congressman whom Sessions is vying to replace, said in an interview Friday.\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened there. I am certainly not prejudging him. But in this political environment, if you have the word \u2018Ukraine\u2019 attached to your name and you\u2019re a candidate, it\u2019s certainly not helpful.\u201d\n\nSessions has said his first meeting with Parnas and Fruman was to discuss energy independence in Ukraine. He said he recalled \u201ca couple additional meetings\u201d over time but did not elaborate.\n\n\u201cThere was no request in the meeting, and I took no action,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nIn May 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and David Correia, his business partner who is also charged, with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office. The caption read: \u201cHard at work!!\u201d\n\nFlores, a 10-year House veteran, said Sessions\u2019 switch bears the look of a \u201ccareer politician\u201d fleeing to what is a starkly different place to represent.\n\nSessions was the congressman for Texas\u2019 wealthy elite in Dallas, where he was popular with the big-donor class. But he is now trying to shift to a district that is 90% rural and carpeted with farms and ranches while encompassing Texas A&M and Baylor.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t see it as a pickup opportunity in 2020, though Flores says it\u2019s not a \u201cslam-dunk\u201d district for Republicans.\n\nSimilarly, GOP operatives in Washington said few in the party there or in Texas were encouraging Sessions to run even before the revelations \u2014 arguing that last year\u2019s loss revealed him to be a flawed candidate.\n\nStill, Lance Phillips, chairman of the Republican Party in Limestone County, part of what would be Sessions\u2019 new district, said he polled area GOP leaders before urging Sessions to run and found a lot of support since no other major candidate was emerging to replace Flores.\n\nPhillips also said he and others were excited by Sessions\u2019 past experience and seniority in Congress, which would help restore some of the congressional clout Texas is losing with so many House retirements. He said Thursday\u2019s arrests won\u2019t change that \u2014 and suggested that the case was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been so flooded with the fake news on all of the different stuff that a lot of this doesn\u2019t really grab hold of anybody anymore,\u201d said Phillips, who added: \u201cThis is a swat at him. I\u2019m sure the Democrats don\u2019t want Pete back up there because he gave them a real hard time last time.\u201d\n\nSessions, 64, announced his plans to run in Flores\u2019 district without yet moving there. He was the House GOP\u2019s campaign chairman in 2010, when the Republicans took back the chamber in the first midterm election under then-President Barack Obama. He seldom faced a real reelection challenge until last year while serving as chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee.\n\nSessions says he\u2019s been friends with Giuliani for more than 30 years but does not know of his business or legal activities in Ukraine. He also says he could not confirm he was \u201cCongressman 1,\u201d but that if he was, he could not have had any knowledge or involvement in the scheme.\n\nSo far, no major Republican has emerged to run in the primary for Flores\u2019 seat against Sessions \u2014 though Texas\u2019 filing deadline is still two months away.\n\nWes Lloyd, among a handful of Republicans in the district considering a run, said Sessions should go back home if he wants a GOP majority again in the House.\n\n\u201cTake your talent and your money and all that and go run in a swing district like the one you just surrendered to Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Lloyd said.\n\n___\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.
