He completed just eight of 22 passes and finished with 100 yards passing.\n\nMayfield didn\u2019t get much help from his supporting cast either as the Browns committed four turnovers.\n\nSan Francisco rushed for 185 first-half yards on Monday, so it didn\u2019t matter that Garoppolo had thrown for only 46 yards.\n\nMayfield was intercepted and lost a fumble in the first 11 1/2 minutes before he completed a pass.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Jimmy Garoppolo threw for 181 yards and Matt Breida rushed for 114 as the San Francisco 49ers won their fourth straight to start", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/17ed82_jimmy-garoppolo-cocks-his-arm-pass-as-san-francisco-49ers-undefeated-streak-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
