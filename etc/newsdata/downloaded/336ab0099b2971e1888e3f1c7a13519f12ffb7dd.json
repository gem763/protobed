Google points out that helium was used in lighter-than-air travel, while argon was used to conserve the filaments in light bulbs.\n\nAs a result of his advancements, Ramsay was considered by many the \u201cgreatest chemical discoverer of his time\u201d.\n\nIn addition to being knighted in 1902, he was named the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1904.\n\nSir William Ramsay died on 23 July 1916, after changing the periodic table forever.", "description": "Google is paying tribute to the life and research of Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay with a Doodle on what would have been his 167th birthday.\u00a0 Born in Glasgow on 2 October 1852, Ramsay is best known for his eventual discovery of what are known as the noble gases.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/18/sir-william-ramsays-167th-birthday-5989542237569024-2x.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
