John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (R-La.), who is also cosponsoring the resolution, added that lawmakers \"can\u2019t just ignore centuries of precedent and the protections set up in our Constitution. Democrats musts think the American people are really stupid.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSpeier to run for Oversight gavel Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump House passes third bill aimed at preventing foreign election interference MORE (D-Calif.) has argued the rules don't require a vote. However, Republicans say it would give them more leeway to call their own witnesses and put swing-state Democrats on the record on launching the impeachment inquiry.\n\nGraham also blasted the media, saying they would be \"beating the shit out of us\" if Republicans were running a similar inquiry against a Democratic president.\n\n\"If we pulled this stunt you would be eating us alive,\" Graham said. \"I think if a Republican were doing to a Democrat what we're doing, you would be all over me and I think it says a lot about people in your business.\"\n\n\"I am confident that if we had an Intel committee inquiry involving a Democratic president where we selectively leaked stuff you would be calling us every kind of bad name, and we would deserve it,\" Graham added.\n\nGraham has emerged as one of the president's loudest supporters against the House impeachment inquiry. His press conference on Thursday came shortly after he went to the White House for lunch and a situation briefing on Syria.\n\nAsked about the lunch and Trump's mood, Graham said \"he felt like since the time he's become president, he's been hounded about things he didn't do. He feels like that it never ends.\"\n\nGraham first floated the idea of the resolution during an interview this week with Fox News's Sean Hannity Sean Patrick HannityThe Hill's 12:30 Report \u2014 Presented by Nareit \u2014 Trump lifting Turkey sanctions after claiming 'permanent' ceasefire Clinton 2020 whisper campaign hits new heights Graham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry MORE.\n\n\"This resolution puts the Senate on record condemning the House. ... Here's the point of the resolution: Any impeachment vote based on this process, to me, is illegitimate, is unconstitutional, and should be dismissed in the Senate without a trial,\" Graham told Hannity.\n\nUpdated at 4:43 p.m.", "description": "Senate Republicans introduced a resolution on Thursday condemning the impeachment inquiry against President Trump and calling on the House to hold a formal vote on the inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/grahamlindsey_092519gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
