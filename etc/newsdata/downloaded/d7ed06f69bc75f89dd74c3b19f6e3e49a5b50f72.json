At the time, the NFL had a double-touch rule that made it illegal for an offensive player to touch the ball if it was deflected by a teammate.\n\nFormer NFL supervisor of officials Art McNally ended the controversy in 2012, telling USA Today's Gary Mihoces two members of the officiating crew said the catch was legal because the ball was touched by Raiders defensive back Jack Tatum.\n\nHarris' 60-yard score gave the Steelers a 13-7 win over the Raiders and remains a staple of NFL highlight packages.", "description": "If a football play is so incredible that it is called the \"Immaculate Reception,\" it better rank high on any list of all-time greatest plays...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/829/255/hi-res-8d21f365871b079388ad656b1cbc94d9_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
