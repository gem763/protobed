It seemed like everyone was in a band and making art of some sort. Bands traded musicians like suburbanites at the time traded spouses.\n\nAnd all the participants dressed for the party. Ms. Harry scoured the city\u2019s thrift shops for prom dresses and other garments she might shred or otherwise interfere with and wear onstage. Tish and Snooky Bellomo, the sisters who opened Manic Panic, the punk atelier, on St. Marks Place in 1977, and sang with Blondie in its early days often accompanied her on these outings.\n\nHouston Street, lined with shops selling sunglasses one week or gaffer\u2019s tape the next, was another source. It was life as bricolage. \u201cI should put a disclaimer on the cover,\u201d Ms. Harry said of her memoir. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of this is real or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone was poor and it was very small and insular, and we were all each other\u2019s audience,\u201d Tish Bellomo said in a phone interview. \u201cIt was the school of punk rock. That the economy was so bad was a good thing, because we could never have done what we did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all wanted to be part of it,\u201d said Cyndi Lauper, who arrived in New York a little later. \u201cDebbie led the pack. She had so many setbacks, and she just kept going.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI should put a disclaimer on the cover,\u201d she said of her new memoir. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of this is real or not.\u201d", "authors": ["Penelope Green"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/fashion/28DEBBIEHARRY-2/28DEBBIEHARRY-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
