It\u2019s too political. It\u2019s too controversial.\n\nAll the fun is being killed by the politically correct pinheads.\n\nCNN has a web tool that allows you to check if your costume is appropriate for the current climate or not \u2014 and by climate, we\u2019re not talking weather.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your costume?\u201d the tool\u2019s first prompt asks.\n\nUsers can then click on \u201cA creative take on current events;\u201d \u201cA sexy version of an otherwise normal thing\u201d; or \u201cA hilarious visual gag.\u201d\n\nFor the first \u2014 \u201ccreative take on current events\u201d \u2014 users are then asked if it \u201ccapitalize[s] on a tragedy or crisis?\u201d Answer \u201cyes\u201d and the advisement comes: \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Answer \u201cno\u201d and users are asked if it is \u201csome sort of Internet meme you\u2019re going to have to spend the whole night explaining?\u201d\n\nSo goes the Q&A for the other potentials as well: \u201cIs it a beloved children\u2019s character? \u2026 You know, a sexy Mr. Rogers costumer DOES exist \u2026\u201d \u201cDoes it involve blackface? \u2014 yes \u2014 Don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s helpful.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s overkill.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s simply for amusement purposes; no harm, no overkill, no foul.\n\nBut here\u2019s one of the CNN test questions that\u2019s more telling than the rest \u2014 \u201cCould people see it as offensive?\u201d\n\nAnd therein lies a problem \u2014 the idea that if somebody sees something offensive in somebody else, that the rest of the somebodies in society are supposed to step in and do something. Where\u2019s society\u2019s sense of humor gone?\n\nThe phrase \u201cmind your own business\u201d has truly been replaced by \u201cyour business is my business.\u201d Even when it comes to something as simple as Halloween garb.\n\nRemember when costumes were just that \u2014 costumes? Fake, and therefore, non-threatening?\n\nEven the offensive ones, the ones with Hitler mustaches. Even the tasteless ones that went over-the-top with stereotypes \u2014 like Native Americans with showy feathers and body paint and rubber-blade tomahawks, or Arabs with fake explosives taped to their chests.\n\nThey may have raised eyebrows, sparked whispers, even expressions of shock and dismay.\n\nBut nobody called the national news. Nobody threatened lawsuits. Nobody organized petitions to politicians to put a stop to the costume-wearing practice.\n\nEverybody just went home and ate their candy. And laughed at the toilet paper hanging off Mrs. Smith\u2019s tree. Now?\n\nNow costumes must be preapproved. Halloween candy\u2019s been replaced by granola. And nobody dares string toilet paper out of fear the environmentalists will come haunting the other 364 days of the year. It may less offensive, more politically correct, and safer and healthier \u2014 but it sure as heck isn\u2019t half as fun.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
