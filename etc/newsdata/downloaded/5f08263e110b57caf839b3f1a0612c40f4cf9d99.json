Their argument is that the debt is illegal because the opposition-led National Assembly never approved its issuance. On Thursday, the Trump administration moved to temporarily shield the collateral from creditors.\n\n\u201cDespite all the efforts to date, the ad hoc administrative board of PDVSA hasn\u2019t achieved a reasonable arrangement with the bondholders,\u201d the board said in a statement. The board \u201cwill take legal actions aimed at protecting its rights based on the invalidity of the 2020 bonds.\u201d\n\nLooming PDVSA Default Pits Ashmore Against Venezuela\u2019s Guaido\n\nLuxembourg-based Clearstream Banking and Brussels-based Euroclear, the clearinghouses for the debt, didn\u2019t receive the $843 million in principal and $71 million in interest due Monday, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nGuaido, recognized by the U.S. and nearly 60 countries as Venezuela\u2019s interim president, scored a last-minute victory on Thursday when the Treasury Department updated its sanctions guidelines to block creditors from seizing their collateral for 90 days. With the Trump administration\u2019s support, Guaido and his allies effectively run Houston-based Citgo, yet have little operational control over its Caracas-based parent PDVSA.\n\nLondon-based Ashmore Group Plc holds about half of the PDVSA 2020 bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BlackRock Inc (NYSE: )., T Rowe Price Group Inc (NASDAQ: ). and the Royal Bank of Canada are among the other top reported holders.", "description": "Venezuela Defaults on Its Last Bond, Setting Up Legal Showdown", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picd5af910aec5076bf3c9149ee246dc1ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
