Max Rose (D-NY) said people \u201chate the Democrats\u201d for beating around the bush when it comes to the policies and positions they support.\n\nRose himself recently flip-flopped on opposing the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry after coming out against the investigation.\n\nThe New York Democrat lawmaker spoke about his party in an interview published Tuesday by Vanity Fair magazine.\n\nVanity Fair described the congressman, a former U.S. military veteran who served in Afghanistan, as a straight shooter who \u201clacks all pretense.\u201d\n\n\u201cRose is sick of politicians who jump on bandwagons such as the Green New Deal or Medicare for All, only to prevaricate when push comes to shove,\u201d Vanity Fair reported.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sign on to that [Green New Deal and Medicare for All] and then say that you are against parts of it,\u201d Rose told the magazine. \u201cTry to present that to folks that are here or anyone that we met today. You know? They will see right through you. That is why people hate the Democrats.\u201d\n\nRose indicated to the magazine that both parties have failed to keep their promises to their constituents. However, the self-described \u201cpopulist\u201d added that voters \u201cdon\u2019t trust Democrats as far as they can throw them.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of trying to understand their constituents, Rose argues, too many Democrats end up patronizing them. They pander during elections, then abandon voters when they get to Washington,\u201d Vanity Fair pointed out.\n\nLast year, Rose became the second Democrat in decades to win the seat in New York\u2019s pro-Trump 11th district. The New York Democrat now represents a district that President Trump won by ten percentage points in 2016. He won the election by painting him as an outsider.\n\n\u201cI have zero allegiance to the Democratic Party, zero,\u201d the freshman lawmaker told Vanity Fair.\n\nOn Monday, protesters flooded the New York Democrat\u2019s office over his newfound support of the impeachment inquiry, dismissed by the White House as a \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional\u201d investigation.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be something that anyone wants to do,\u201d Rose told Vanity Fair, referring to his support of the investigation.\n\nDemocrat leaders in the House are carrying out an impeachment inquiry devoid of the recognized standards governing similar efforts in the past, namely those involving Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has refused to hold a full House vote on authorizing an impeachment inquiry. During the Nixon and Clinton administrations, lawmakers did hold a vote.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters in Congress argue that such a vote is necessary to legitimize the investigation per the recognized standards of previous impeachment efforts.\n\nNot all of the 235 members of the House Democratic Caucus support the impeachment inquiry. Democrat lawmakers who represent Republican-leaning or Trump-friendly districts have come out against the investigation.\n\nAccording to a tally by the New York Times, ten Democrat House lawmakers oppose the impeachment inquiry.\n\nInternal polling suggests a storm is brewing for vulnerable Democrats in key congressional districts.\n\nPolling by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) shows most voters do not consider Trump\u2019s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart an impeachable offense.", "description": "Rep.
