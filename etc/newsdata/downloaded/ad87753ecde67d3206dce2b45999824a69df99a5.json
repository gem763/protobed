Since 2014, the local authority subjected him to a care plan which limits his freedoms due to his behaviour towards women and his lack of understanding of a woman\u2019s right to consent.\n\nHowever, the man has won his case to have the care plan lifted. A Court of Protection judge ruling that despite the dangers he poses to women, he has a \u201cfundamental right to sex\u201d, reports The Guardian on Thursday.\n\nMrs Justice Roberts said that insisting he understand consent before embarking on a sexual relationship was tantamount to discrimination because it would \u201cimpose on him a burden which a capacitous individual may not share\u201d.\n\nThe judge said the man \u201chas already made it abundantly clear that he wishes his experience of life to include sexual relations and the ability to find a partner\u201d.\n\n\u2018He is anxious to have a sexual partner and believes that the current restrictions represent an unfair and unwarranted interference in his basic rights to a private and family life,\u201d she added.\n\nThe judge acknowledged that as a result of her ruling the man might be exposed \u201cto the risk of criminal prosecution\u201d if he attempts intercourse with women against their will. But she said every person \u201cis entitled to make the same mistakes which all human beings can, and do, make in the course of a lifetime\u201d.\n\nJudge Said Foreign Criminal Could Stay as Gang Membership Proves Integration into British Society https://t.co/J8uqyuI5Nr \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 10, 2019\n\nA clinical psychologist had earlier submitted a report saying the 36-year-old presented a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d of committing a sexual offence against a woman.\n\nThe local authority had said in comments reported by the Metro that the man had been put on the care plan after he had been \u201cbehaving in a sexually inappropriate manner towards women\u201d.\n\nThe psychologist had noted that \u201cthis is most likely to take the form of sexual harassment through the form of repeated, unwanted sexually explicit messages\u201d. It was also revealed during the hearings that he had \u201climited social boundaries around women\u201d. This extended \u201cparticularly those who are vulnerable but also women in pubs or clubs whom he has approached whilst dancing\u201d.\n\nThe local authority warned that if unrestrained, the man might pose a \u201crisk to potentially vulnerable females\u201d.\n\nThe authority is expected to appeal against the decision.\n\nThis is not the first time British institutions have made decisions with potentially dangerous consequences when managing the care of people with diminished responsibility.\n\nLast year, The Times revealed that a court had authorised an autistic 23-year-old woman with an IQ of 52 to be \u201cpimped out\u201d for sex as part of a \u201clearning experience\u201d.
