In 2010, for example, scientists used the physicist\u2019s work in an experiment to turn information into \u201cpure energy,\u201d according to LiveScience.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "Scientists have discovered a previously unknown type of light wave using the theories of a 19th-century mathematician and physicist.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/JamesClerkMaxwellGetty2019.jpg"}
