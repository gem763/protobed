(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to \"look into\" Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 reelection rival, as well as the president's lingering grievances from the 2016 election, according to a rough transcript of a summer phone call that is now at the center of Democrats' impeachment probe.\n\nTrump repeatedly prodded Volodymyr Zelenskiy, new president of the East European nation, to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer. At one point in the July conversation, Trump said, \"I would like for you to do us a favor.\"\n\nThe president's request for such help from a foreign leader set the parameters for the major U.S. debate to come \u2014 just the fourth impeachment investigation of an American president in the nation's history. The initial response highlighted the deep divide between the two parties: Democrats said the call amounted to a \"shakedown\" of a foreign leader, while Trump - backed by the vast majority of Republicans - dismissed it as a \"nothing call.\"\n\nThe call is one part of a whistleblower complaint about the president's activities that have roiled Washington and led Democrats to move ahead with an impeachment inquiry of the Republican president on the cusp of the 2020 campaign.\n\nAfter being stymied by the administration, members of the House and Senate intelligence committees took their first look at the complaint late Wednesday. Republicans kept largely quiet, but several Democrats, including Intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, called the classified account \"disturbing.\"\n\nSome from both parties want it to be made public. Congress is also seeking an in-person interview with the whistleblower, who remains anonymous.\n\nTrump spent Wednesday meeting with world leaders at the United Nations, a remarkable TV split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump era. Included on his schedule: a meeting with Zelenskiy.\n\nIn a light-hearted appearance before reporters, Zelenskiy said he didn't want to get involved in American elections, but added, \"Nobody pushed me.\" Trump chimed in, \"In other words, no pressure.\"\n\nThe next steps in the impeachment inquiry were quickly developing a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the probe. A rush of lawmakers, notably moderate Democrats from districts where Trump remains popular, set aside political concerns and urged action.\n\nOne option Pelosi is considering, pressed by some lawmakers, is to focus the impeachment inquiry specifically on the Ukraine issues rather than the many others Congress has already been investigating.\n\n\"For me, that's what's important,\" said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., among the new lawmakers in Congress with national security backgrounds. She said it's \"just an egregious idea that the president of the United States can contact a foreign leader and influence him for dirt on a political opponent. ... That can't be normalized.\"\n\nPelosi announced the impeachment probe Tuesday after months of personal resistance to a process she has warned would be divisive for the country and risky for her party. But after viewing the transcript on Wednesday, Pelosi declared: \"Congress must act.\"\n\nTrump, who thrives on combat, has all but dared Democrats to move toward impeachment, confident that the specter of an investigation led by the opposition party will bolster rather than diminish his political support.\n\n\"It's a joke. Impeachment, for that?\" Trump said during a news conference in New York. He revived the same language he has used for months to deride the now-finished special counsel investigation into election interference, declaring impeachment \"a hoax\" and the \"single greatest witch hunt in American history.\"\n\nRepublicans largely stood by the president and dismissed the notion that the rough transcript revealed any wrongdoing by Trump.\n\n\"I think it was a perfectly appropriate phone call, it was a congratulatory phone call,\" said Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican. \"The Democrats continually make these huge claims and allegations about President Trump, and then you find out there's no there there.\"\n\nThe Trump administration also continued to raise questions about the whistleblower's motives. According to a Justice Department official, the intelligence community's inspector general said in letter to the acting director of national intelligence that the whistleblower could have \"arguable political bias.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "President Donald Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine to \"look into\" Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 reelection rival, as well as the president's lingering grievances from the 2016 election, according to a rough transcript of a summer phone call that is now at the center of Democrats", "authors": ["Lisa Mascaro", "Mary Clare Jalonick", "Julie Pace"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bu5eT5hgcMCbxJy06aDt_w--~B/aD0yNjY2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/f1680ed7c6d8f186a50ef7ddfbfbf470", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
