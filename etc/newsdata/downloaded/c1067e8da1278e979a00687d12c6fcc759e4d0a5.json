Instead, Apple is selling a separate $1,000 stand.\n\nPeople are freaking out about it, but they shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 it\u2019s more a mistake of messaging on Apple\u2019s part and a missed opportunity to frame the computer screen as $1,000 off for professional users that already own a stand.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nApple just announced a $5,000 computer screen that doesn\u2019t come with a stand. Instead, the stand costs an extra $1,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not made of carbon fiber or encrusted with jewels. Though the stand seems to be perfectly nice, it doesn\u2019t appear to stand out in any particular way.\n\nIt is exactly what it proposes to be: a computer-monitor stand.\n\ncaption Apple\u2019s new $5,000 Pro Display XDR. source Apple\n\nSome folks are very upset that Apple is selling a computer-screen stand for $1,000 \u2013 the same price as a new iPhone XS and even approaching the cost of a new entry-level MacBook.\n\nOne headline from a tech blog sums up much of the reaction: \u201cA $999 monitor stand is everything wrong with Apple today.\u201d\n\nAt the event where the monitor stand was announced, Worldwide Developers Conference 2019, the audience audibly responded to the lofty price tag:\n\nAnd yes, of course, $1,000 is a lot of money to spend on a computer-screen stand. After all, we\u2019re talking about a piece of metal that holds up a screen.\n\nMoreover, a computer-monitor stand \u2013 like a TV stand \u2013 is something most people think of as part of the monitor (or TV) itself. This is not only an expensive stand but also an extra cost for something people expect to be included.\n\nAnd this speaks to an existing feeling people have about Apple: The company charges luxury prices for relatively common items, and it nickel-and-dimes its customers for additional add-ons, like an iPhone fast charger, which isn\u2019t included in the box.\n\nBut in this particular case, that\u2019s not really what\u2019s happening.\n\ncaption iPhone owners complained about Apple nickel-and-diming them for the cost of the iPhone dongle. source Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\n\u201cThe truth is a lot of people doing professional video editing and things like that are using these displays that are mounted in place, and they have stands already,\u201d the popular tech vlogger Marques \u201cMKBHD\u201d Brownlee said in his latest video. \u201cWhen they upgrade displays, they take them out and put them in the same place, and they don\u2019t need to buy new mounts and new stands for them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a smart point, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s being lost in the outrage over Apple charging $1,000 for this monitor stand.\n\nHe continued: \u201cYou and me, and most people watching WWDC, and most normal people just think of a monitor and a stand together. So what [Apple] should have said was this is a $6,000 monitor, but if you want to buy it without the stand it\u2019s $1,000 off \u2013 $5,000.\u201d\n\nIn other words, instead of presenting the screen\u2019s stand as an add-on, Apple should have presented it with the full package price and an optional $1,000 discount for the professional video editors and developers watching that already own a compatible stand.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a measure of Apple overcharging for something \u2013 it\u2019s a measure of Apple selling a niche product with a niche customer and their niche budget in mind, and then failing to stick the landing during the announcement. Admittedly, Apple isn\u2019t known for creating a lot of niche products. But the Mac Pro line is an exception; it\u2019s a device made with a specific type of professional in mind, one who\u2019s in an industry where a $6,000 reference monitor is thousands cheaper \u2013 and in some cases, tens of thousands cheaper \u2013 than the competition.\n\nCheck out Brownlee\u2019s video right here for his full argument:", "description": "Business Insider - Apple is a victim of its own poor messaging \u2014 by separating the stand price from the display, Apple shot itself in the foot..
