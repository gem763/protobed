Also in the issue: Franklin Foer reports on Hungary\u2019s downward authoritarian spiral, through the lens of the attacks on its last independent educational institution, Central European University; an oral history of Donald Trump\u2019s bigotry, compiled from dozens of interviews with those who\u2019ve witnessed it firsthand; Darcy Courteau chronicles the story of Luz Mirella Zamora, an undocumented resident of the U.S. for 25 years who recalls her border crossings; and Shakespeare expert Elizabeth Winkler makes the case that the Bard\u2019s iconic works were penned by a woman named Emilia Bassano.\n\nOn the cover, Carroll makes the case for broad transformation of the entire Catholic ethos, ending the requirement of celibacy for priests and the Church\u2019s misogynist exclusion of women from the priesthood. The Church, he says, must bring lay people into positions of real power and foster equality for women as officeholders in the Vatican. \u201cYes to female sexual autonomy; yes to love and pleasure, not just reproduction as a purpose of sex; yes to married clergy; yes to contraception; amd, indeed, yes to full acceptance of homosexuals,\u201d Carroll writes. \u201cNo to male dominance; no to the sovereign authority of clerics; no to double standards.\u201d\n\nHe points to Vatican II as evidence that potential transformation is possible, recalling how the Church radically revised Catholic teachings about Jews following the Holocaust. \u201cThe formal renunciation of the \u2018Christ Killer\u2019 slandeer by a solemn Church council, together with the affirmation of the integrity of Judaism, reaches far more deeply into Catholic doctrine and tradition than anything having to do with the overthrow of clericalism, whether that involves women\u2019s ordination, married priests, or other questions of sexuality,\u201d Carroll writes. \u201cUnder the assertive leadership of a pope, profound change can occur, and it can occur quickly. This is what must happen now.\u201d\n\nEven so, Pope Francis likely won\u2019t make such drastic changes. Carroll recommends that Catholics like him\u2014worshipers appalled by what the sex-abuse crisis has shown the Church leadership to have become\u2014abandon the hierarchy, taking their faith back by holding their own services. \u201cAs ever, the Church\u2019s principal organizing event will be the communal experience of the Mass, the structure of which\u2014reading the Word, breaking the bread\u2014will remain universal; it will not need to be celebrated by a member of some sacerdotal caste,\u201d he writes. By abstaining from the pews, Catholics can remind themselves that the Church is not its power structure. Instead, \u201cThe Church is the people of God.\u201d\n\nPress Contact:\n\nHelen Tobin // The Atlantic\n\n646.539.6706", "description": "To save the Church, the former priest advocates for the end of clerical hierarchy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/a/theatlantic/img/default-thumbnail.png"}
