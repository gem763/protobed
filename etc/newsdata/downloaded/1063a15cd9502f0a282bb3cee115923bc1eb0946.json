For Mugabe, it was an \"unconstitutional and humiliating\" act of betrayal by his party and people, and left him a broken man.\n\nConfined for the remaining years of his life between Singapore where he was receiving medical treatment and his sprawling \"Blue Roof\" mansion in Harare, an ailing Mugabe could only observe from afar the political stage where he once strode tall. He was bitter to the end over the manner of his exit.\n\nOn the eve of the July 2018 election, the first without him, he told reporters he would vote for the opposition, something unthinkable only a few months before.\n\nEducated and urbane, Mugabe took power in 1980 after seven years of a liberation bush war and - until the army's takeover - was the only leader Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, knew since independence from Britain.\n\nBut as the economy imploded starting from 2000 and his mental and physical health waned, Mugabe found fewer people to trust as he seemingly smoothed a path to succession for his wife Grace, four decades his junior and known to her critics as \"Gucci Grace\" for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping.\n\n\"It's the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation, in which a dictator, as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife,\" Chris Mutsvangwa, leader of Zimbabwe's influential liberation war veterans, told Reuters after Mugabe's removal.\n\n\n\n\n\n'A JEWEL'\n\nBorn on Feb. 21, 1924, on a Roman Catholic mission near Harare, Mugabe was educated by Jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to South Africa's University of Fort Hare, then a breeding ground for African nationalism.\n\nReturning to then-Rhodesia in 1960, he entered politics but was jailed for a decade four years later for opposing white rule.\n\nWhen his infant son died of malaria in Ghana in 1966, Mugabe was denied parole to attend the funeral, a decision by the government of white-minority leader Ian Smith that historians say played a part in explaining Mugabe's subsequent bitterness.\n\nAfter his release, he rose to the top of the powerful Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, known as the \"thinking man's guerrilla\" on account of his seven degrees, three of them earned behind bars.\n\nLater, as he crushed his political enemies, he boasted of another qualification: \"a degree in violence\".\n\nAfter the war ended in 1980, Mugabe was elected the nation's first black prime minister.\n\n\"You have inherited a jewel in Africa. Don't tarnish it,\" Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere told him during the independence celebrations in Harare.\n\nInitially, Mugabe offered forgiveness and reconciliation to old foreign and domestic adversaries, including Smith, who remained on his farm and continued to receive a government pension.\n\nIn his early years, he presided over a booming economy, spending money on roads and dams and expanding schooling for black Zimbabweans as part of a wholesale dismantling of the racial discrimination of colonial days.\n\nWith black and white tension easing, by the mid-1980s many whites who had fled to Britain or South Africa, then still under the yoke of apartheid, were trying to come home.\n\n\n\n\n\nNO CHALLENGES", "description": "Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was feted as an African liberation hero and champion of racial reconciliation when he first came to power in a nation divided by nearly a century of white colonial rule.
