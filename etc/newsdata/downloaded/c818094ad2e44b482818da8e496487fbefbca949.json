The macaques breed of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT.\n\n\"They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages. Many of the animals have developed compulsive tendencies and are seen going round in circles.\"\n\n(Image: CEN/Cruelty Free International a)\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of protesters took to the streets to protest against the animal lab.\n\nMulln added: \"I have had goosebumps all day. Around 7,500 people took part in the demonstration and another 700 took part in a picket action in front of the lab.\n\n\"I didn't expect that many people.\"", "description": "WARNING: DISTRESSING FOOTAGE - There are fresh fears that the barbaric Hamburg centre has been relocated", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Cen Cruelty Free International A"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712512.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-CEN-MonkeyTests-12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
