Authorities have charged Meyer with murder.\n\nMeyer told police he saw someone trying to break into his storage shed around 5 a.m. after hearing a noise outside. He then grabbed his gun, went out and yelled that he'd shoot if the person came closer, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe person took several steps toward him, Meyer told investigators, so he fired. As the burglar dropped his pickax and ran toward a nearby park, Meyer fired another shot \"into the night\" in the direction of the park. Investigators wrote the suspected burglar posed no threat of serious bodily injury once he ran off, based on Meyer's account.\n\nAllegedly not knowing whether he shot anyone, Myer told police he went back to bed. He got up around 7 a.m. and told police he thought he saw a \"black bag\" in the park. It turned out to be the man's body, according to the affidavit.\n\nMeyer then told a 911 dispatcher he was the victim of a crime and that medical help was needed, the affidavit said.\n\nOnline jail records had no information about an attorney to speak for Meyer, who was no longer in custody Sunday. His bond was set at $150,000 Friday, The Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Dallas man went back to bed after shooting burglar: police", "description": "A 72-year-old Dallas man fatally shot a suspected burglar outside his home, authorities said, and went back to sleep\u00a0before calling police.", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
