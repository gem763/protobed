Ash's comments reflect growing scepticism on that score in some quarters.\n\nThe French foreign ministry declined to comment and the Elysee was not immediately available for comment. But French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Macron had gone out of his way to meet Zelenskiy before he was elected, something that was uncommon in normal protocol.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from German officials.\n\nZelenskiy, who held talks with Trump in New York on Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, had resisted calls for Ukraine to release details of the July 25 call with Trump during which the U.S. president asked him to investigate the son of Biden, the front-runner in the Democratic Party race for the November 2020 election.\n\nZelenskiy told reporters on Wednesday he had thought that only Trump's side of the call would be published and that he believed that details of such calls \"between presidents of independent countries\" should sometimes not be published.\n\nHe said he did not know the details of the investigation into Biden's son, saying it was one of many cases he discussed with world leaders if asked and that he wanted his new general prosecutor to investigate all cases without interference.\n\nZelenskiy also tried to smooth over things with Merkel and Macron, saying he was grateful for their help and that he had made his comments about them during \"a difficult period.\"\n\n\"I don't want to say anything bad about anyone,\" Zelenskiy said after meeting Trump. \"We thank everyone who helps us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDAMAGE DONE?\n\nBut some at home said the damage had already been done.\n\n\"Of course the background to relations with European leaders and especially Merkel will worsen,\" said Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta think tank.", "description": "KIEV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - For U.S. President Donald Trump, White House publication on Wednesday of a memo summarizing his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy fueled a domestic political crisis.
