It would be best for everyone. We are working on his transfer to a new team.\u201d\n\nBale is still upset by his treatment by Zidane, with little dialogue between the pair, who strangely left him out of the squad for last week\u2019s Champions League game against Club Bruges which ended in a 2-2 draw.\n\nIt would appear likely that Bale wants to leave having resolved to go to China, where he would have doubled his salary in a three-year deal, knowing he was not wanted by Zidane.\n\nHe is upset not just with the Frenchman but also with Real, believing he was not supported by the club during a difficult time and that the way he was treated was unnecessary. It is understood his feelings have not changed since the summer.", "description": "Gareth Bale remains \u201cbadly hurt\u201d by the way he has been treated by Real Madrid.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212140526-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqk--b1aDvxTQVszVMARw2xLCAXk_LxhDsjjs5_ukcFwc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
