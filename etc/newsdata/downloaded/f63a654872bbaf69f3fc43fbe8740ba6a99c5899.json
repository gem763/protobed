He was jailed in Vietnam in 2006 for molesting two girls, and on his return to the U.K. was placed on the sex offenders\u2019 register for life.\n\nView photos Gary Glitter's song appears in the new Joker film.

In the wake of his criminal charges, several sports teams that heavily used the instantly recognizable 1972 song during contests, removed \u201cRock and Roll Part\u201d from their playlists.\n\nNow movie-goers are concerned that the singer will receive royalties for the song's inclusion in the movie. However, a music industry expert says that is unlikely to be the case.\n\n\u201cArtists are usually paid a one-off \u2018synchronization fee\u2019 when their songs are used on movie soundtracks,\u201d Ray Bush, managing director of The Music Royalty Co. tells Yahoo Movies U.K.\n\n\u201cIt can range from \u00a3500 (about $615 U.S.) for smaller acts up to \u00a3250,000-\u00a3500,000 ($307,000 to $615,000 U.S.), depending on the artist and the importance to the narrative of the film. There are many middlemen involved, including the record label, Glitter\u2019s agent and sometimes a \u2018synchronization\u2019 agent, with artists sometimes only receiving a measly amount from the deal.\u201d\n\nHe added that Glitter\u2019s current status wouldn\u2019t have given him much leverage to push for a big payday from the deal.\n\nGlitter would receive residual royalties from the film\u2019s success if the song was included in an album release to promote the film, but as of now, the only soundtrack available for the film is an album featuring Hildur Gu\u00f0nadottir\u2019s orchestral score. The song is likely to receive a listening boost from its inclusion in unofficial fan-curated soundtrack playlists, but streaming services are likely to pay out only a nominal sum.\n\nView photos Gary Glitter on stage in London in 1975.
