Lendlease has commitments - either signed contracts or contracts provided - over half of the first tower's 317 apartments.\n\nThere have been more than 200 display suite inspections since the project was launched in September and more than 800 expressions of interest. Each inspection requires refundable deposits of $10,000.\n\nOf the commitments so far, 85 per cent have been from offshore buyers. Lendlease requires 30 per cent deposits from offshore buyers and 20 per cent from local purchasers.\n\n\"This aids in de-risking the project,\" wrote the Macquarie analysts, who have maintained an outperform rating on the stock.\n\nNo apartments numbers with no. 4\n\nAs well, Lendlease has removed floor numbers that use the number 4 an effort to appeal to a \"greater demographic of buyer\", according to the Macquarie.\n\nEast Asian cultures, including that of China, typically consider the number four to be unlucky because it sounds similar to the word for death.\n\nThe fact that entire Barangaroo zone is under a 99-year lease has not led to valuers or banks assessing the risk differently to freehold, according to Macquarie.\n\nThe healthy rate of sales at One Sydney Harbour is good news for Lendlease's bottom line the years to come, with as much as $400 million earnings from the first tower as settlements come in, likely to be in financial year 2024. The remainder of the project completes in 2024 and 2025.\n\nGiven the investment required to develop the three towers Lendlease may look to sell down a stake in the project or forward sell cashflows from it, according to Macquarie.", "description": "Property giant Lendlease is on the way to collecting $2 billion in revenue from the first tower alone in its three-building One Sydney Harbour development at Barangaroo and 85 per cent of buyers are offshore.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_826/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d2c9fc7e0042063f7917405fb51b05dcd9fa4a21", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
