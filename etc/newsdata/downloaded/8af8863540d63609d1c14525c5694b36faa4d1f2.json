The first space policy directive that Trump signed was an order for NASA to send people back to the Moon, and in March, Vice President Mike Pence called on NASA to expedite its lunar return by \u201cany means necessary\u201d \u2014 a challenge that supposedly came from the president. Last month, Trump even requested an additional $1.6 billion in his budget, so that NASA could go back to the Moon.\n\nFor all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2019\n\nIn response to the all of this pressure from the White House, NASA has branded its big lunar return \u201cArtemis,\u201d claiming that the agency will send the first woman to the Moon through the program. As part of the initiative, NASA plans to build a new space station around the Moon, where future astronauts can travel to and from the lunar surface. The space agency recently awarded a contract to a commercial company to start building parts of the lunar space station, called Gateway, and it soon plans to select companies to build lunar landers that can carry humans to the Moon.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet is also confusing, as he claims that the Moon is \u201ca part\u201d of Mars. It\u2019s possible that Trump may be referring to a common refrain from NASA that the Moon is a proving ground for Mars exploration. Many engineers and scientists argue that the lunar surface is a great place to test out technologies that will be needed to send humans to the Red Planet in the long run.\n\nThere it is: Trump seems to have been badly paraphrasing something he heard on a Fox segment. (\u201cHe was watching Fox\u201d is a common answer to \u201cwhy did he tweet that tweet?\u201d) https://t.co/dsxZ5v3W7G \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) June 7, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Trump tweeted this today. However, just this morning NASA announced that it is opening up the International Space Station to more commercial business opportunities, and NASA executives have been doing interviews on that topic, as well as commenting on the space agency\u2019s Moon plans. Just this afternoon, NASA\u2019s chief financial officer, Jeff DeWit, went on Fox Business, a channel Trump watches, and talked about the agency\u2019s Moon plans.\n\nDespite all this confusion, the White House seems to be standing behind Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cOur administration\u2019s goal has always been to get to Mars,\u201d a White House official said in a statement to The Verge. \u201cWe have asked Congress for additional resources to get to the Moon by 2024, which will enable us to get to Mars roughly a decade after creating a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. Under POTUS, America is leading again in space.\u201d And this afternoon, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted in favor of NASA\u2019s Mars missions.\n\nAs @POTUS said, @NASA is using the Moon to send humans to Mars! Right now, @MarsCuriosity and @NASAInSight are on Mars and will soon be joined by the Mars 2020 rover and the Mars helicopter. pic.twitter.com/Br1sTYfNzd \u2014 Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) June 7, 2019\n\nNASA is currently gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing in July. The Verge reached out to NASA for comment and will update when we hear back.\n\nUpdate June 7th, 5:30PM ET: This post was updated with a statement from a White House official and Bridenstine\u2019s tweet.", "description": "After years of the White House pushing NASA\u2019s human exploration programs back toward the lunar surface, President Trump tweeted today that the space agency should not be focused on the Moon, but instead on Mars, defense, and science.", "authors": ["Loren Grush", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfK614UMqKPEdrNfm0SBZ3aN3ZQ=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16277395/gateway_orion_approaching.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-07"}
