Black is watchin' child soldiers gettin' killed by other children,\" Dave hypnotically chants in the hit track \"Black\".\n\n\"The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice. A kid dies, the blacker the killer, the sweeter the news.\"\n\nDave first made headlines when Canadian superstar Drake remixed his 2016 single \"Wanna Know\".\n\nAdding another political twist, the Oxford rock band Foals wore Extinction Rebellion stickers and shared their support for the climate activists, led by the Swedish teen Greta Thunberg.\n\n\"Everyone can kind of unite over the environmental issues,\" Foals guitarist Jimmy Smith said.\n\n- Female voices -\n\nThis year's list of contenders included punk rockers -- a throwback to Britain's last era of political tumult under the late prime minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe politically-charged punks Idles' \"Joys as an Act of Resistance\" made The Times newspaper recall \"a gang of skinheads in 1981\".\n\nThe Irish punks Fontaines DC came up with \"Dogrel,\" an album bemoaning the gentrification of Dublin and -- in their eyes -- demise of its city centre.\n\nFemale voices were represented by the likes of Anna Calvi, a queer singer-songwriter whose \"Hunter\" explores gender issues -- and more.\n\n\"People recognise that your queerness is a big part of the energy you create. But it's not the only thing,\" she said upon the album's release.\n\nCate Le Bon, who mixes pop with folk on \"Reward,\" has won rave reviews and follows a year-long time out in which she studied furniture making.\n\nThe judges wrote that this year's award \"celebrates both the striking diversity of British and Irish music-makers and their shared purpose in exploring issues of identity and belonging at a time of division and disagreement\".", "description": "Angst-filled rapper Dave scooped up Britain's coveted Mercury Prize on Thursday in a politically-charged London finale that included an expletive shouted from stage at Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
