REUTERS/Ruben Sprich/File Photo\n\nIt is the first investment by Etihad in another airline since its \u2018equity alliance\u2019 strategy, which once saw it hold stakes in as many as eight other carriers, unravelled.\n\nAir Arabia Abu Dhabi will be an independent joint venture based at Abu Dhabi International, the hub of Abu Dhabi state-owned Etihad, the two carriers said in a statement.\n\nIt will be the capital\u2019s first budget carrier.\n\nFurther details such as when the airline would start flying or ownership structure were not disclosed. An Etihad spokeswoman said more information would be given in the near future.\n\n\u201cThis exciting partnership supports our transformation program and will offer our guests a new option for low-cost travel to and from Abu Dhabi, supplementing our own services. We look forward to the launch of the new airline in due course,\u201d said Etihad Group CEO Tony Douglas.\n\nEtihad has been pursuing a turnaround strategy since 2017 that has seen it downsize its operations, including cancelling dozens of Airbus and Boeing orders.\n\nUnder Douglas, who joined in 2018, Etihad has refocused on becoming a mid-sized carrier, while stepping away from its investments in some of the airlines it holds stakes in.\n\nEtihad, which has lost nearly $5 billion in the past three years, spent billions of dollars buying minority stakes in other airlines including insolvent Air Berlin, and Jet Airways.\n\nEarlier this month, a senior executive said Etihad expected to be profitable again by 2023.\n\nAir Arabia Abu Dhabi will be the UAE\u2019s fifth airline. Others include Emirates, one of the world\u2019s largest airlines, and Dubai discount carrier flydubai.\n\nAir Arabia, the UAE\u2019s only listed airline, has its main hub at UAE\u2019s Sharjah airport and also has operating bases in Egypt, Morocco, and UAE\u2019s Ras Al Khaimah.\n\nThe Egyptian and Moroccan operations are joint ventures.", "description": "Etihad Airways and Air Arabia are jointly setting up a low cost carrier in Abu Dhabi to tap into growing demand for budget travel from the United Arab Emirates' capital, they said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441481023&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F13Q", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
