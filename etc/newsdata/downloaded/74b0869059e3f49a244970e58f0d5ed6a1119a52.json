They don\u2019t want to be a burden.\n\n\u201cWe take away the burden, the stigma.\u201d\n\nWhile the business has a crowdfunding page, the plumber said he recently had to lay off two employees.\n\nBut despite accruing \u00a38,000 in debts, Anderson says he will continue offering help to those who need it, free of charge.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
