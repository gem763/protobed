REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nThe central bank described all regional economies as either expanding or recovering in its regional report, which it will closely scrutinise among various other surveys and indicators, in the run-up to its next policy-setting meeting on Oct. 30-31.\n\n\u201cDomestic demand has continued on an uptrend, although exports, production and business sentiment have been affected by a slowdown in overseas economies,\u201d the central bank said in a quarterly report analysing the economic conditions of the regional areas of Japan.\n\n\u201cA virtuous cycle from income to spending remains intact at both the corporate sector and households,\u201d it added.\n\nThe central bank raised its economic view of Hokkaido, northern Japan, to say it has been \u201cexpanding moderately,\u201d thanks to infrastructure spending on reconstruction from last year\u2019s natural disasters. Previously, the bank said the region\u2019s economy had been recovering moderately.\n\nOn the downside, reinforcing evidence that the bruising Sino-U.S. trade war and global slowdown were taking a toll on the export reliant Japan, the BOJ cut its view on factory output in the western Japanese region of Shikoku.\n\nThe central bank attributed the downgrade to slowing demand for production machinery and electronics parts and devices.\n\nHowever, the central bank stuck to its views on private consumption on all the nine regions, describing them as either staying firm, picking up, recovering or increasing moderately.\n\nIt also noted some fluctuations caused by the Oct. 1 sales tax hike in some regions.\n\nSolid consumption, weak exports\n\nFirmness in private consumption, which accounts for well over half of economic output, could bolster the BOJ\u2019s argument that solid domestic demand will offset the pain of weakening exports.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s main scenario is that external pressure will ease in the latter half of this fiscal year and next on the back of a recovery in demand for items such as IT-related goods.\n\n\u201cHowever, uncertainty over overseas economies, including U.S.-China trade friction, is large, so we must be vigilant to its impacts on Japan\u2019s exports and output,\u201d said Yasuhiro Yamada, BOJ\u2019s branch manager in Osaka, western Japan - home to electronic giants such as Panasonic Corp (6752.T).\n\n\u201cMany companies have voiced expectations that the tax hike impact will be smaller than the last time, thanks to various measures (the government has) taken to level out demand,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday the central bank would not hesitate to take additional easing steps if risks to the economy grow and threaten momentum towards its 2% inflation target.\n\n\u201cWe need to pay closer attention to the possibility that momentum towards achieving our price target will be lost,\u201d Kuroda said in a speech at a quarterly meeting of the central bank\u2019s regional branch managers.\n\nThe BOJ will also monitor the economic impact of Saturday\u2019s powerful typhoon and strive to maintain financial functioning and smooth settlement of funds, he added.", "description": "The Bank of Japan on Tuesday raised its assessment for one of the country's nine regions and stuck to its sanguine view on the rest, though frail factory production and exports suggested pressure for more stimulus is unlikely to ease anytime soon.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440910015&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E014", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
