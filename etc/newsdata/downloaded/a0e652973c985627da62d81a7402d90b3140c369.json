REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Picture\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - France has yet to decide whether to build new nuclear reactors and could yet pursue a long-term strategy of 100% renewable energy, Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Monday.\n\nThe minister was responding to questions on Europe 1 radio after the CEO of state-controlled power utility EDF (EDF.PA) last week said it is clear France is preparing to build new reactors.\n\nEDF operates all of France\u2019s 58 nuclear reactors, which account for more than 75% of the country\u2019s electricity needs.\n\n\u201cEDF does not determine French energy policy,\u201d Borne said, pointing to France\u2019s previously announced policy on reducing the nuclear power to 50% of the electricity mix by 2035 while increasing the contribution of renewables.\n\n\u201cThe decision on new reactors has not been made. There are different scenarios with new nuclear reactors in the mix. We are also looking at a scenario where we have 100% renewables,\u201d Borne said.\n\nBorne also said that President Emmanuel Macron has reiterated that there will be no decision on new reactors until the commissioning of EDF\u2019s Flamanville 3 EPR reactor under construction in the north of France.\n\nHer comments follow a report on the Le Monde website last week, in which Borne and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire were said to have sent a letter to EDF asking the company to prepare plans for the construction of six EPR nuclear reactors over the next 15 years.\n\nThe Flamanville 3 reactor - the latest generation of reactor with enhanced safety features put in place after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown in Japan - has been plagued by delays, technical problems and cost overruns. It is now expected to start operating in 2023, more than a decade behind schedule.\n\n\u201cWhat we expect from EDF is an explanation on the cost overruns and delays at Flamanville 3,\u201d Borne added.", "description": "France has yet to decide whether to build new nuclear reactors and could yet pursue a long-term strategy of 100% renewable energy, Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443315475&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0QA", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
