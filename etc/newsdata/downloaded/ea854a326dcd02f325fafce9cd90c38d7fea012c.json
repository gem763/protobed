It makes SO much sense. pic.twitter.com/5S76ezwIuD \u2014 Netflix Is A Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke) October 5, 2019\n\nThe character, named Ali, then boldly delivers an explanation of pansexuality, which she describes as attraction that\u2019s not limited by gender identity.\n\nWhen classmate Nick (Nick Kroll) asks if being pansexual is the same as being bisexual, Ali rejects the comparison, calling bisexuality \u201cso binary.\u201d\n\nShe continues:\n\n\u201cSome of you borings like tacos and some of you like burritos, and if you\u2019re bisexual, you like tacos and burritos. But I\u2019m saying I like tacos and burritos, and I could be into a taco that was born a burrito. Or a burrito that is transitioning into a taco.\u201d\n\nIn response to the clip, many from the queer community voiced concerns. Some felt the monologue implied bisexuality is not inclusive, while others felt it made trans people out to be a third gender altogether.\n\nBisexuality includes trans people; always has, always will. Thanks once again for the misinformation and further ostracisation of trans people in regards to sexuality. \u2014 Atlas (@elfmanatlas) October 6, 2019\n\nlisten i love big mouth but this is a gross misunderstanding of the actual differences between bisexuality and pansexuality. implying bi people can't be into trans people? not cool :/ \u2014 rabid catboy kim seokjin (@zamothac) October 6, 2019\n\nBISEXUALITY ISN'T BINARY, this episode was a disservice to the bisexual community \u2014 noah (@noahalina) October 6, 2019\n\nThis is a harmful and incorrect definition of bisexuality. @netflix \u2014 Rachel Walden (@rachel_w) October 6, 2019\n\nOne thing that\u2019s especially glaring / bad (imo) about them getting bi vs pansexual wrong is that this whole show is all about explaining sexual concepts no?\n\n\n\nLike if you\u2019re going to take up that mantle and peddle yourself as being knowledgeable then this is even worse. https://t.co/jvQyJZN1Er \u2014 Sophia Benoit (@1followernodad) October 8, 2019\n\nSee like here's the thing. I'm a trans woman and I'm straight. I pretty much only date men. A lot of those men are cis and also straight. And it's really hard to find dates when stuff like this keeps telling those guys that dating me makes them not straight. \u2014 Ghoulia \ud83d\udc80 (@JuliaFtacek) October 6, 2019\n\nThis bit was definitely written by a cis straight person. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Bisexuality includes binary trans people & always has. If she means she's attracted to nonbinary and two-spirit people then sure, maybe pansexuality is a better label, but the way they're explaining it here is so wrong. \u2014 Elliott \ud83c\udf3f (@BecomingElliott) October 7, 2019\n\nbig mouth slapped until they decided that bisexuality excludes transgender people which is INCORRECT delete the scene and try again y\u2019all \u2014 micah \u2642 (@micahxrutland) October 7, 2019\n\nI really love Big Mouth and just saw The Scene from the new season and wow what an easily-avoidable offensive massive fuck-up! \u2014 N is for Nicole, Who Fell Off a Cliffe (@Nicole_Cliffe) October 7, 2019\n\n2.) Even if later context improves the scene, sharing this sans context provides an inherently transphobic explanation of bi versus pansexuality. \u2014 Emily VanDerWerff (@tvoti) October 7, 2019\n\n4.) There are different definitions of panaexuality, but the one pan people have shared with me most is that they are attracted to people regardless of gender expression. Men, women, non-binary, and beyond.\n\n\n\nThese definitions are always personal! Don't take my word as gospel. \u2014 Emily VanDerWerff (@tvoti) October 7, 2019\n\nnot a single bisexual in the writing room this is pathetic \u2014 Allie \ud83c\udf83 CRIER\u2019S WAR OUT NOW (@alliewithbooks) October 6, 2019\n\n\u201cBig Mouth\u201d co-creator Andrew Goldberg responded to the backlash on Monday, posting a statement on Twitter on behalf of the show\u2019s creators and executive producers.\n\nGoldberg admitted the show \u201cmissed the mark\u201d with its \u201cdefinition of bisexuality vs. pansexuality.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy fellow creators and I sincerely apologize for making people feel misrepresented,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt also thanked the \u201ctrans, pan, and bi communities for further opening our eyes to these important and complicated issues of representation\u201d and promises to do better in the future.", "description": "\u201cMy fellow creators and I sincerely apologize for making people feel misrepresented,\u201d Andrew Goldberg said.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cd7f9210000e70633dd90.jpeg?cache=lhrjgiclbt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
