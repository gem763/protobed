Hitler\u2019s attitude towards the Jews had been explicit in Mein Kampf, a threat whose urgency was confirmed by the Nuremberg laws of 1935, excluding German Jews from Reich citizenship and prohibiting them from marriage or sexual relations with persons of \u201cGerman or related blood\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adolf Hitler and Nazi youth leader Baldur von Schirach inspect Hitler youth at the Nuremberg rally in 1934.

Indeed, such was the alarm over their treatment, in the first instance, that Britain\u2019s prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, within days of the Kristallnacht pogrom by SA troopers also in 1938, approved the Kindertransport to rescue unaccompanied German Jewish children.\n\nWhile a popular idea has taken root that somehow the discovery of death camps at their liberation was a surprise to an unsuspecting world, that was far from true.\n\nEven as the massacres of Jews by Nazi mobile killing squads began in summer 1941, in immediate wake of the surprise German attack on the Soviet Union, the first intimations of the Holocaust were being reported back to London and Washington by British military intelligence, by the Polish government in exile and by journalists and diplomats. On 14 August, 1941 Churchill made public fears of what was happening in areas captured by the Germans, referring in a radio broadcast to a \u201ccrime without a name\u201d to describe the slaughter of \u201cscores of thousands of civilians\u201d.\n\nSo why was the issue so hard for the allies to grasp?\n\nOver the years, historians, both critical and friendly, have offered competing explanations that have run the gamut from proposing that allied war leaders struggled to understand the scale of the crime unfolding to claims that Churchill and Roosevelt were simply indifferent. Others have pointed to the practical difficulties of intervention in the midst of total war, including the range of allied bombers, the diversion of resources required, and the view in allied governments that defeating the Axis powers was the best way to secure the safety of Europe\u2019s threatened civilians, including its Jews.\n\nBy the end of 1942, however, there was little doubt what was happening. On 13 December 1942, the celebrated US journalist Ed Murrow gave Churchill\u2019s \u201ccrime without a name\u201d a clear framing in a radio broadcast.\n\n\u201cMillions of human beings, most of them Jews, are being gathered up with ruthless efficiency and murdered,\u201d he said. \u201cThe phrase \u2018concentration camps\u2019 is obsolete\u2026 it is now possible only to speak of extermination camps.\u201d\n\nAnd as the author Dan Plesch \u2013 who has spent recent years studying forgotten and suppressed\n\narchives relating to the allied response to the Holocaust \u2013 points out, allied leaders were aware of the vast scale of the crime the Nazis were engaged in.\n\nIn a joint statement which would be read to a silent House of Commons four days after Murrow\u2019s broadcast by foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, allied governments revealed the ongoing Nazi effort to systematically transport and \u201cexterminate\u201d Europe\u2019s Jews, naming Poland as the \u201cprincipal slaughterhouse\u201d and threatening to hold German leaders to account.\n\nThe catch, however, was articulated almost in Eden\u2019s next breath as he answered MPs\u2019 demands for something to be done. \u201cIt would clearly be the desire of the United Nations to do everything they could to provide wherever possible an asylum for these people,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut the House will understand that there are immense geographical and other difficulties in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe reality is that even when confronted with hard evidence of the unfolding genocide, key institutions in Washington and London, including the state department and the Foreign Office, did not see intervention as a key priority, either through the antisemitism of key officials, because they didn\u2019t care, or saw other military and diplomatic issues as taking precedence.\n\nOn the British side, Viscount Cranborne, one of Churchill\u2019s ministers, felt able to tell his fellow lords he did not believe that Jews should be considered a special case and that the British empire was already too full of refugees to offer a safe haven.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jewish women and children get off coaches at their arrival in Auschwitz extermination camp on 20 January 1942.

Even as late as August 1944, senior Foreign Office officials were still urging scepticism over stories of atrocities that came from \u201cJewish sources\u201d.\n\nOn the US side, a similar story played out amid a toxic atmosphere towards immigration, not least European Jewish immigration, which began in the 1930s and that informed Roosevelt\u2019s public caution on the issue, not least when confronted by a Congress hostile to his stance on the threat from Nazi Germany. And like the Foreign Office, the US state department was regarded as a stumbling block to those seeking to help Jews; it was accused in January 1944 by US treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau of sabotaging the most modest relief efforts.\n\nYet even if air raids on the camps or railways, discussed by the Churchill\u2019s war cabinet, were deemed impractical, the most baffling moment of inaction remains the Bermuda conference in April 1943, called following public pressure in the US to discuss the rescue or relief of Europe\u2019s Jews including those still attempting to flee from from Europe. It ended with no change in stringent US quotas for Jewish immigration or Britain\u2019s ban on Jewish migration to Palestine, which could have saved at least some lives. In the end it was too little and too late; a conference designed not for action but to soothe public concerns.\n\nEight decades on, as the world marks the anniversary of the outbreak of war, it is still necessary to recall not only the allies\u2019 ultimate victory but their greatest failure when confronted with a vast catastrophe foretold.\n\nInside today: a 32-page magazine to mark the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of war.", "description": "Shock greeted the news that German tanks had rolled into Poland on September 1, 1939.
