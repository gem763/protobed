All Turkish military operations under the recent offensive known as Operation Peace Spring will pause during that time, and the operation itself will come to an end entirely upon the completion of the Kurdish withdrawal, under the terms of the deal.\n\nERDOGAN THREW TRUMP'S 'DON'T BE A FOOL' LETTER IN THE TRASH, SOURCES CLAIM\n\n\"This is a great day for civilization,\" Trump declared in a tweet following a press conference where Pence and Pompeo discussed the deal. \"I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this 'Deal' for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!\"\n\nTrump claimed that just three days ago, such an agreement \"could NEVER have been made,\" but that \"tough love\" was required to accomplish it.\n\nIn addition to agreeing to the terms of a cease-fire, both the U.S. and Turkey \"committed to defeat ISIS activities in northeast Syria,\" Pence announced during a press conference.\n\n\u201cTurkey and the United States agree on the priority of respecting vulnerable human life, human rights, and particularly the protection of religious and ethnic communities in the region,\u201d the vice president added.\n\nThe commander of Kurdish-led forces in Syria later told Kurdish TV they will abide by the deal, which Pence said was reached after more than five hours of negotiations with Erdogan and Turkish officials.\n\n\"We think the agreement today first ends the violence, which is what President Trump sent us here to do,\" Pence said. \"We achieved that.\"\n\nPence said that the U.S. did not approve of Turkey's military operation, but under the terms of the deal will lift sanctions against Turkey upon the fulfillment of the agreement from both sides.\n\nThe Turkish offensive began after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria. Trump was heavily criticized for the move by lawmakers from both parties.\n\nLast week, Trump sent a letter to Erdogan encouraging him to \u201cwork out a good deal,\u201d threatening to \u201cdestroy\u201d the Turkish economy if Erdogan continued his aggression against the Kurds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy.
