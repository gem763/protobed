It\u2019s not a console but it is a platform that plays its own games, that you have to buy separately just like a console or a PC. That format is Stadia and it was meant to be the future of gaming. But I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that it\u2019s going to be a footnote at best. Google has finally entered the video games business and they\u2019ve half-assed it in spectacular fashion.\n\nA couple of years ago there was a lot of fear and trepidation about giant tech companies, that previously had little or nothing to do with games, entering the games industry and making their own console or, as is more fitting nowadays, offering some sort of streaming service. Since they have their own games studios and own Twitch, Amazon was rumoured to be one of them but nothing has ever been announced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple were another and the result was Apple Arcade, which is\u2026 excellent. For \u00a35 you get access to a whole host of top quality mobile games that don\u2019t use microtransactions and are really great indie experiences. It\u2019s one of the best value deals I\u2019ve ever seen and absolutely the best way to enter the games business because it\u2019s something that didn\u2019t exist before and isn\u2019t some aggressive attempt at a hostile takeover.\n\nStadia isn\u2019t either, but that\u2019s not much of a comfort. When it was first announced everyone assumed it was the \u2018Netflix of games\u2019, a simple phrase that also seemed to be something that would be welcome and useful. The description got so overused that Google had to come out and specifically say that\u2019s not what it is. With Stadia you have to buy games for full price just like a regular console. The only benefit is you don\u2019t have to actually pay \u00a3400 for a console, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s enough.\n\nThe recent revelations about Stadia only really working properly with a TV are embarrassing, but the problem is that even if it did work properly Stadia doesn\u2019t seem to have any benefits beyond the no-console thing. There\u2019s the obvious problem that it\u2019s probably not going to work reliably with ordinary broadband connections, especially for those outside large cities, and if they can\u2019t even get a wireless controller working at launch I don\u2019t have much faith in any of their other technical promises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the other issue is that they have zero exclusive games so far. Maybe there\u2019s an indie one I missed but I don\u2019t think so and there\u2019s certainly nothing major that would count as a killer app. I mean, Destiny 2 is the game they\u2019re promoting as the first big free game. Destiny 2.\n\nThe reason I say that it\u2019s probably for the best that Stadia is going to fail is that Google just don\u2019t seem to understand gaming and nothing they have done so far has offered anything even slightly exciting for the average gamer. Where\u2019s all that picture-in-picture stuff from the reveal and talk of amazing new styles of games that can only be doing via streaming? That\u2019s not even being previewed at launch, let alone released.\n\nCompare what they\u2019re doing to Microsoft\u2019s Project xCloud, which is just quietly getting on with its beta tests at the moment and which I have much more faith in. They haven\u2019t made any wild promises, they\u2019ve just pointed to their worldwide servers and Game Pass, both things that are up and running and already known to be very good, and said that they\u2019ll try and combine the two together.\n\nThey\u2019ve even said that for the next generation consoles will still be more important, which seems very sensible and honest. Google, as happens so many times in the games industry, is just rushing through technology that isn\u2019t ready yet and which is actually going to put people off it (remember motion controls?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe worst thing is Google has a shocking track record of binning new ideas if they don\u2019t work out (check out this website: Google Graveyard \u2013 there\u2019s six they\u2019ve shutdown just this month, including a VR headset!). That seems to me to be the obvious fate of Stadia, after a year or so of false promises and wasting everyone\u2019s time.\n\nBy reader Hansom\n\nThe reader\u2019s feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.
