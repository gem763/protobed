Iran claimed it was enriching uranium only to fuel nuclear power plants, but the development of more advanced centrifuges would allow the country to develop nuclear bombs much faster.\n\nAn Iranian government spokesperson had said Monday the country would \"take a strong step\" away from the 2015 deal if Europe could not offer it new terms by the end of the week.\n\nRouhani said Wednesday that Iran would walk back any agreements made in the nuclear deal, in order to protect its rights and interests.\n\nROUHANI SAYS IRAN'S RESPONSE TO BILATERAL TALKS WILL ALWAYS BE 'NEGATIVE'\n\nThe agreement by Iran, the U.S., Britain, China, China and Russia -- and Germany -- had lifted economic sanctions in 2016 in exchange for Iran's ceasing nuclear activities. Iran signaled it wanted Europe to offer the country a way to sell its crude oil on the global market amid crushing sanctions enacted by the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal over a year ago, halting those sales and promising sanctions.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction, that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful, nuclear energy program,\" Trump said last year after fulfilling his campaign promise to withdraw. \"Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.\"\n\nU.S. TREASURY SANCTIONS TANKER FILLED WITH IRANIAN OIL AFTER FOX NEWS REPORT\n\nEarlier, Rouhani had expressed interest in negotiating a way out of the crisis with the U.S. Trump said last week there was a \"really good chance\" he would meet one-on-one with the Iranian leader on their nuclear impasse.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rouhani backpedaled and said he would refuse to meet the president until the U.S. lifted sanctions. \"If someone intends to make it as just a photo-op with Rouhani, that is not possible,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe two countries ratcheted up tensions earlier this year after the regime attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz and later shot down an unmanned American drone earlier. Trump ordered military strikes on the regime this past June, only to cancel them last minute when he heard the number of casualties they would cause.\n\nTrump said he would not go to war over the tanker attacks, calling them \"very minor\" in an interview with Time magazine, but said he would \"certainly\" go to war over nuclear weapons.", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani announced Wednesday that Iran will take its \"third step\" in scaling back commitments it made to the 2015 nuclear deal by developing centrifuges to speed up the enrichment of Uranium.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/ContentBroker_contentid-edf2f049b8384a5da0db84744b12743b.png"}
