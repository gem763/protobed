As a result, services on East Midlands Railway are reported to be extremely crowded.\n\nThe pressure on the Sheffield-London line was intensified by cancellations on the West Coast main line from Manchester to the capital.\n\nNational Rail says: \u201cA points failure between Crewe and Stockport means that all lines are currently blocked.\u201d\n\nSeveral trains between Manchester Piccadilly and Crewe have been cancelled. London-bound trains on the alternative route via Stoke-on-Trent have been delayed. And the line between Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent is currently closed because of flooding.\n\nMeanwhile the LNER website is still assuring passengers that the state-owned train operator is running a \u201cgood service\u201d on the East Coast line.\n\nFurther planned engineering work by Network Rail will disrupt early services on Sunday, with no fast trains northbound before 11am.", "description": "Thousands of passengers using key inter-city rail lines are having their journeys disrupted. \u201cStaff shortage\u201d has been blamed for the sudden cancellation of key express trains on Britain\u2019s flagship rail line.
