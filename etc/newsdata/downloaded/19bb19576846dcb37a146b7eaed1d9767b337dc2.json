Brexit may be changing all that.\n\n\"We're looking at a political earthquake here,\" says Raab's challenger, Monica Harding, in an interview.\n\n\"Raab is my MP, but I can't vote for him,\" an executive at a large US investment bank told Business Insider.\n\nA leafy town on the outskirts of London that's home to some of the City's top bankers and hedge fund managers is an unlikely hotbed of political revolution.\n\nBut one nonetheless may well be underway.\n\nIn the Esher and Walton constituency in the county of Surrey \u2013 a stronghold of Britain's Conservative party for decades \u2013 a London hedge-fund manager has been hard at work volunteering, recruiting neighbors, and donating cash to unseat the local member of Parliament, and Britain's current Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab.\n\nThe fund manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing fears of pro-Brexit backlash from clients and colleagues, is a resident in the district, where property prices average at around \u00a3759,000 ($935,000). He balances his efforts, he told Business Insider, with a day job managing about $2 billion from his fund's office in the City.\n\nHe is supporting Raab's challenger, Monica Harding of the Liberal Democrats, the only major British political party that has openly said it wants to stop Brexit and remain in the European Union.\n\nLast month, the fund manager said he attended a meeting with economists and strategists at a big investment bank in London. It was supposed to be a roundtable discussion about the global trade war. The subject instead swerved to the fund manager's trip to attend the Liberal Democrat party conference in Bournemouth.\n\n'Cheering around the conference room'\n\n\"They started cheering around the conference room,\" the fund manager said of the reaction to his Bournemouth trip. \"It was supposed to be a lunch with China expert. The first third of meeting was everyone grilling me,\" about the conference.\n\nAt stake is the Brexit threat to the fate of the City \u2014 London's financial industry is the British economy's cash cow and supports about 1 million jobs. Raab, who also serves as First Secretary of State under Johnson, backs the prime minister's \"no deal,\" leave-at-all-costs stance. It's an unpopular position in Esher and Walton, which backed 'Remain' in the 2016 Brexit referendum by 60% to 40%.\n\n\"We're getting seven new members per day in Esher and Walton, and a huge amount are working in financial services,\" Harding told Business Insider in an interview. \"We've raised, in the past two months, more than we've raised in the last two to three years, and the money is coming from the people you're describing,\" in hedge funds, banks, brokerages, and other City firms, she said.\n\nRaab's challenger, Liberal Democrat Monica Harding liberal democrats\n\nHarding said: \"It's a huge revolution. We're looking at a political earthquake here.\"\n\nHowever, polling numbers aren't quite as bullish. Raab has a majority of somewhere around 25,000 votes and the seat is number 58 on the party's target list for the next election, requiring a swing to the Lib Dems of more than 20% from the last general election. The latest polls suggest that nationally there has only been a swing to the party of around 12%.\n\nIt's a long shot by any measure. And as yet there is no date scheduled for an election.\n\nThe stockbroker belt\n\nEsher and Walton area is part of a ring of towns and villages around London known as the stockbroker belt, due to the large number of City workers who commute into the capital from there.\n\nNational polling suggests the Liberal Democrats are likely to have leapfrogged the Labour party, who were the previous main challengers in Raab's seat.\n\nLabour, who were once darlings of City figures during the leadership of former prime minister Tony Blair, now struggle to find support among banker types. Not helping them win over Remainers in the City is the fact that Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has taken an ambivalent position on Brexit, refusing to say whether his party would campaign for or against leaving the EU in a second referendum.\n\n'They don't want to lose their jobs'\n\nThe UK press is rife with headlines about \"disaster capitalists\" lobbying for Brexit while positioning themselves for profit. But a recent Financial News survey of more than 40 hedge fund managers found that, contrary to public opinion, most don't support Brexit.\n\n\"The pound will decline, the economy will have a recession, the banking system will be catatonic, the housing market will crash, the far right will rule, and everything will suck,\" the hedge-fund manager said.\n\nHarding said the sentiment behind the \"huge groundswell\" of support for her can be summed up more simply: \"They don't want to lose money, and they don't want to lose their jobs.\"\n\n\"In any Brexit, 1,600 jobs will be lost in Esher and Walton, we think it will be more than that,\" she said. \"If they do lose their job, it's taking longer to find a new job. They worry about paying their school fees, or not being able to afford the fees.\"\n\nAt first, \"we didn't even think to campaign in the big gated communities,\" she said. But since, \"floors have flung open and they're inviting me for tea and coffee, and they want to give me money, because they're incensed at the current government.\"\n\nBritain's Conservative party has held on to power in the area since it was established, but there are signs of shifting sentiment. The Tories lost three seats in a May local election in Elmbridge, in Surrey, including one to Liberal Democrat Ashley Tilling.\n\nTories 'paid the price'\n\nThe Tories \"unfortunately paid the price for the chaos that's going on at Westminster \u2014 the fact that we've not yet sorted out Brexit,\" the leader of the Elmbridge Conservatives, James Browne, told SurreyLive after the May vote outcome.\n\n\"There were a lot of residents who told us yesterday that they were not going to vote Conservative this year,\" he said.\n\nThe hedge-fund manager echoed the comments: \"Opinions are changing,\" he said, especially among what he called called \"low-tax Tories reluctant to defect to the Lib Dems but are appalled at the current government.\"\n\n\"Raab is my MP, but I can't vote for him,\" a separate London-based executive at a large investment bank told Business Insider, citing the government's handling of Brexit.\n\nBrexit supporters are rife\n\nIf it is a revolution, it may be a small, localized one. Elsewhere in the City, Brexit supporters are rife.\n\n\"I know a few Remainiacs in the City who have lost the plot,\" over what they assume will be catastrophe for the City because of Brexit, another London banker, who does not live in Surrey but in another leafy commuter town, told Business Insider. \"But most seem pragmatic and grateful for a bit of volatility. It's tricky to make money in very low-vol markets because nobody trades.\"\n\nEven if the Lib Dems never take power in Esher and Walton, change is afoot.\n\nOver a glass of distractingly delicious Rioja at a private members club in Mayfair, the hedge-fund manager described 10 of his neighbors \u2014 \"die-hard Tories their whole life,\" he said. \"When I advocated a pro Lib Dem stance on a community chat six months ago, these same 10 were berating me because they were Tory.\"\n\n\"Now, they are nicer and put up signs\" supporting the Lib Dems, he said. \"They didn't apologise, though.\"", "description": "\"Opinions are changing,\" says one hedge fund manager. Wealthy residents of the Tory stronghold of Surrey are \"appalled at the current government.\"", "authors": ["Trista Kelley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9094142e22af36ce699b98?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
