I never had to worry much out there.\"\n\nLee said he had a \"positive round.\"\n\n\"It got windy at the end, the last five holes, but my ball-striking has been really nice, and I and made some putts,\" Lee said. \"Unfortunately I bogeyed the last hole.\"\n\nAfter a 66 on Thursday, Jason Day bogeyed four of his last six holes Friday for a 73 and was eight strokes behind.\n\nLast year's runner-up Gary Woodland had a second straight 71 and was 11 behind at 2-under with Phil Mickelson, who shot 72. Defending champion Brooks Koepka had four bogeys on his first nine for a 75 and was 13 strokes behind.\n\nMickelson had the shot of the day, hitting a 353-yard tee shot which hit the flag on the par-4 14th, stopping 8 inches from the cup. That set up a tap-in eagle.\n\nThere are 78 players in the no-cut, limited-field event. It's the first of three PGA Tour events in Asia, continuing next week at the Zozo Championship in Japan which includes Tiger Woods, and ending with the World Golf Championship event in Shanghai.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
