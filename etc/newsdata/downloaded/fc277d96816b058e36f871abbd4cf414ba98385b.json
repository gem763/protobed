Weaving dramatic tales of a republic in peril, slinging charges with no established basis, she fell in line with the younger, brasher wing of her party before one word had been released from the Trump conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart. She heaped mounds of stigma onto the infamous \u201cwhistleblower\u201d report with no firm knowledge of what it says.\n\nThis seemed nervy, even from a party that has peppered the nation with endless impeachment teases. Pelosi\u2019s decision to pick up that hymnal is an important gesture, even though there is nothing concrete behind the \u201cinquiry\u201d she has announced. It\u2019s little more than the promise of a broader, busier gaggle of committees beating the drum they have flogged since soon after the inauguration.\n\nIt is important because it temporarily quiets the narrative that Pelosi is a desperate leader out of step with the modern party. At least in the short term, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll be hearing further snarky asides from radicalized freshmen about generational rifts. Madam Speaker is on board.\n\nBut is she really? Has she suddenly decided that impeachment is a wise 2020 campaign strategy, or was the writing so indelibly on the wall that she figured she\u2019d better satisfy the masses or risk irrelevancy?\n\nEither way, she is now the face of impeachment; her fate will rise and fall with its plausibility. The early news is not good.Cirque du Soleil in its most daring shows cannot rival the contortionists seeking to find something sinister in the quotes from the Trump phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Corruption and outright illegality exist in that memo only in the reddened eyes of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics.\n\nThis is not surprising in this latest season of illiteracy regarding the law. The whistleblower statutes are meant to provide cover within agencies for brave souls who sense malfeasance and seek to bring it to light without committing career suicide. It does not extend in any fashion to miscreants seeking to troll the president of the United States.\n\nThe phone call memo is dead on arrival as a force toward Trump\u2019s ruin. Now we may get to enjoy the spectacle of the leaker (a far better term) testifying before Congress. Please tell me who thinks this is a good idea. The Robert Mueller testimony may look positively coherent by comparison.\n\nThe arc of this story can certainly change. As the gaggle of House committees tries to avoid stepping all over each other, a hungry media climate will devour every development. This may or may not be of benefit to a Democratic Party that has telegraphed its doubts about any of its candidates\u2019 ability to beat Trump next year.\n\nThat 2020 field will spend the coming weeks talking about little else. The topical oxygen that would otherwise be devoted to their healthcare plans, their environmental forecasts and even their broad critiques of the Trump era will now be consumed by the minutiae of Ukrainegate. If that story collapses under the weight of its own silliness, Democrats may look back on this week\u2019s momentary glee and wonder if there is an exit strategy from a quagmire of their own making.", "description": "This shiny new \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d package placed under an early .09/26/2019 1:21:43AM EST.", "authors": ["Mark Davis", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/4eac3f1e-f209-4120-b351-68e1cf258b71.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
