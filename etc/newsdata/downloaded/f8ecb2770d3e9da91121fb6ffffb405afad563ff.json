When parents come with their kids they can find one or two things they used to have at home and show it to their kids, they can remember what it used to be like and I think it is a great experience for everyone,\u201d said curator Robert Vujtek.\n\nMany of the items here have been donated by the public. There is section dedicated to childrens\u2019 toys, another devoted to trekking and camping and even a room showing Communist-era fashion.\n\nAptly called Retro, the exhibition is housed in the famous Dancing House in Prague, designed by Frank Gehry and Vlado Milunic.\n\nIt runs until the middle of October 2016.", "description": "An exhibition celebrating Communist-era interior design and fashion has opened in Prague.", "authors": ["Robert Hackwill"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/342183/1000x563_342183.jpg", "published_at": "2016-08-25"}
