(AP) - After two straight losses - by 43 points one week, 36 the next - Syracuse coach Dino Babers remains upbeat.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re fine,\u201d Babers said Monday. \u201cI think that we have an opportunity to win every game that we have from here on out. I think the big thing that we need to make sure of happened last year - Clemson can beat you once, but you don\u2019t let them beat you twice.\u201d\n\nThe Orange (1-2, 0-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) lost 41-6 on Saturday night to the No. 1 Tigers before a sellout Carrier Dome crowd of over 50,000 that as the game unfolded was relegated to being a nonfactor against an opponent Syracuse has had recent success against. That setback came on the heels of a 63-40 loss at Maryland and dropped Syracuse into a tie for 111th in scoring defense despite a shutout over Liberty in the season opener.\n\n\u201cOur philosophy is there\u2019s always enough players to win,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThat\u2019s what coaching is for - to find a way to put them in the right spot. We\u2019ll keep working. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far off.\n\n\u201cThe guys that we were playing were really good. I thought for three quarters we played well. We didn\u2019t score enough points. We tried to find ways to create things. We tried to take chances to score points. We had to score some points to let them feel the pressure and have a chance.\u201d\n\nThe Orange didn\u2019t, though the defense gave the offense a terrific chance to make a game of it early in the third quarter while trailing by 11. Chris Fredrick intercepted Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence near midfield and returned the ball to the Clemson 9, prompting a deafening roar from the crowd.\n\nThe glee was short-lived, ending on the ensuing play when Syracuse quarterback Tommy DeVito was picked off at the 4-yard line, his fourth interception of the season. Three plays later, Lawrence completed a quick sideline pass to Amari Rodgers and he went 87 yards for a score and a 24-6 lead.\n\nStopping the run and making DeVito throw was the focus. He was sacked eight times by a defense that had 15 tackles for 71 yards in losses and also hurried DeVito seven times while passing. The Syracuse offense netted just 15 yards rushing on 42 attempts as Clemson outgained Syracuse 612-187 - and both teams ran 71 offensive plays.\n\nBabers says he expects defenses to continue to focus on stopping the run until DeVito, a redshirt sophomore with three starts under his belt, changes their minds. He\u2019s 60 of 101 for 678 yards and three touchdowns while the run game is averaging a paltry 2.4 yards per carry and 92.3 per game.\n\n\u201cIf you were going to play us right now, there\u2019s no reason for you to let the passing game get going,\u201d Babers said. \u201cYou want to take away the run and see if we can beat them with the pass. There\u2019s smart coaches out there. That\u2019s how they\u2019re playing us.\u201d\n\nSyracuse won 10 games last year for the first time in 17 years, going 6-2 after a heartbreaking 27-23 loss at Clemson in late September. The Orange also were 6-0 at home, only the fourth time they finished unbeaten in the Carrier Dome since the building opened in 1980. The Clemson loss broke that streak, and Babers used the moment as a reminder, taking the team back on the field after the game for a little character-building.\n\n\u201cThe guys were just disappointed, and they needed to be talked to, so I talked to them and brought them back out,\u201d Babers said. \u201cThat \u201cS\u201d in the middle of the field has a special meaning to us. That\u2019s home, and when you go home and you have a conversation, it normally means a lot more than having it at someone else\u2019s house. It was just a conversation that I wanted to have on the \u2018S\u201d\u2019.\n\nSyracuse will try to get back on track Saturday against Western Michigan in the Carrier Dome. The Orange also have home games against FCS school Holy Cross, Pittsburgh, Boston College, and Wake Forest, and travel to North Carolina State, Louisville, Florida State, and Duke.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After two straight losses - by 43 points one week, 36 the next - Syracuse coach Dino Babers remains upbeat.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/clemson_syracuse_football_19356_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
