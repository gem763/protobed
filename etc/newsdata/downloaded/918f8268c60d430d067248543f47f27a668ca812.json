At one point, she walks up to the camera and asks: \u201cHey man, can you spare a cigarette? Do you know of a place to sublet?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know where I could cash this check?\u201d she continued. \u201cI hate Chevrolet, I hate Norman Bates, I hate the United States.\u201d\n\nThe video, Alphabet City Serenade, was part of a series filmed for local television, which featured several poets including Burns, a Chemehuevi-Anishinaabe, who was active in the New York poetry scene.\n\nPrada in the desert: how a fake luxury boutique became a Texas landmark Read more\n\nThe voice of Burns and many more Native American New Yorkers are now in a new exhibition that recently opened at the Museum of the City of New York. It showcases over 30 years of artwork made by Native American artists in New York for Urban Indian: Native New York Now, which features tapestries, sculptures, videos, photography and community memorabilia alongside Burns\u2019 video work.\n\nThis exhibition coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Native Indian Community House, a non-profit that continues to promote the visibility of Native Indians in an urban setting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a flourishing Native presence here in New York,\u201d said co-curator Rebecca Hayes Jacobs. \u201cGiven the history of erasure, misrepresentation and appropriation of Native cultures by museums and other cultural institutions, we wanted to prioritize native self-representation, to let them speak for themselves to the greatest degree possible.\u201d\n\nAmong the works in the exhibition, Pena Bonita is showing a 2015 sculpture called Hanging Out on Iroquois and Algonquin Trails, which features a series of hanging bags, emblazoned with Manhattan street names, filled with shredded dollar bills.\n\n\u201cMoney enclosed in the hanging bags are references to the historical exploitation of New York and the current wealth that still profits from this,\u201d the artist writes in a statement.\n\nThere are several videos in the exhibition, including 1992 interviews with a group called We Wah and Bar Chee Ampe, one of the first LGBTQ Native American organizations in New York, and the clip is from an episode of the cable TV program, The Brenda and Glennda Show, which looked at queer politics through a humorous lens.\n\nOne photo features the life-sized diorama at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. The 1939-made scene shows a 17th century meeting between the Lenape tribe and Dutch settlers, which has been criticized by activists for its inaccurate cliches of Native representation, as well as ignoring violent colonization experienced by the tribe. The museum has added labels framing the diorama in a historical context, with the title phrase: Reconsidering This Scene.\n\n\u201cThese stereotypes are problematic, and they\u2019re still very powerful,\u201d said Bradley Pearce the visual historian at the museum. \u201cThey shape the American public\u2019s understanding of Indigenous people.\u201d\n\nAbove this photo, a banner hangs above, one from the Indigenous Kinship Collective, which reads: ReMatriate, resist and rise. An accompanying video shows some of the group\u2019s members explaining the importance of bringing together Indigenous women in New York, as one woman says: \u201cI was lacking having a kind of community who really understood where I was coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a self-organized, decentralized, woman\u2019s organization,\u201d said the co-curator, Jason Lujan, a Chiricahua Apache. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a building or a home, but they still operate. They\u2019re one of the different types of organizations in New York that all share a common goal.\u201d\n\nDennis RedMoon Darkeem, Flag, 2018 Photograph: Dennis RedMoon\n\nAnother video on view features Louis Mofsie, a Hopi-Winnebago New Yorker who is a co-founder of a group called the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers, who have been hosting annual celebrations since 1963.\n\n\u201cOur parents all came from reservations, but we were born here in the city,\u201d notes Mofsie. \u201cAs kids, our families taught us dances from our own tribes, but we were very interested in learning other dances.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a large tapestry, covered in patches of fabric. Covered in floral patterns \u2014 from pink and white, to orange and brown \u2014 as well as sewn-on buttons and stars, it was created in 2015, and used as a backdrop for a play at Spiderwoman Theater, a New York-based Indigenous women performance troupe that was founded in 1976. It\u2019s the oldest running Native, feminist theatre in the world, according to one of its co-founders, Muriel Miguel. \u201cOur mission has been to address and highlight cultural, social and political concerns in Indigenous and women\u2019s communities,\u201d she said.\n\nThere\u2019s also an artwork by Bronx-based artist Dennis RedMoon Darkeem, called Flag from 2018. The fabric wall piece has stripes, stars and plaid patterns. \u201cPart of his work is centered around the fact that he\u2019s African American and Native Indian,\u201d said Lujan. \u201cHe makes a lot of work around who is allowed to be Indian, as there are polarities presented in a black Indian.\u201d\n\nLastly, one wall is covered with replicas of magazine covers of Native Nations. It ran only for four issues in the early 1990s, featuring the works of Native writers who wrote about urban life in New York. Though it\u2019s gone today, it left a lasting impact.\n\nPartly because the magazine\u2019s first issue featured a painting by Lloyd Oxendine, dated from 1987. The artist was integral for building the Native art community in New York.\n\n\u201cLloyd was one of the catalyzing personalities in New York City, he basically jumpstarted the contemporary native art movement as we know it now,\u201d said Lujan. \u201cBefore that, it was just crafts from Santa Fe.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe brought together two sensibilities,\u201d he adds, \u201cthat urban living can live alongside traditionalism and being Native Indian, no matter where you were from.\u201d", "description": "In a new exhibition, the work of Native American artists in New York is being heralded in opposition to a \u2018history of erasure, misrepresentation and appropriation\u2019", "authors": ["Nadja Sayej"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3283d87264bd48678b161af3b9bbd978657e68c/114_532_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37830762a0c750185e9341699585f06a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
