I want to alleviate any awkwardness that might come from me admitting I go to therapy.\u201d\n\nSome divulgences go over better than others: \u201cMy last serious boyfriend acted a little defensive about it, as if my being in therapy was a direct response to some of his bad behavior.\u201d\n\nBut for the most part, the good responses outweigh the bad. Many people tell her they go to therapy too, which she appreciates: \u201cIt means the person is in touch enough with their emotions to know that they need some help figuring things out.\u201d\n\nThese days, Roscher\u2019s experience is a common one. With more and more millennials leaning into psychotherapy \u2015 they\u2019re not called the \u201ctherapy generation\u201d for nothing \u2015 breakthroughs and other session experiences have become common table talk on dates.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State University, which compiled data from 147 colleges and universities, the rate that students were using counseling centers climbed steeply in the preceding five years. Statistically speaking, you\u2019re bound to date some active therapygoers.\n\nWhile getting help for mental health has been stigmatized in the past (\u201cThey\u2019re in therapy? What happened?\u201d), these days, people recognize the value of seeing a therapist, especially when navigating the highs and lows of dating.\n\n\u201cI went out with someone last winter who excitedly shared how life-changing going to therapy has been for him, and someone else more recently who said they\u2019d found therapy to be very helpful when they came back from active duty,\u201d said Micki Cordova, a research associate in behavioral neuroscience in Portland, Oregon.\n\nTo young adults who have seen their parents navigate rocky personal lives (sometimes including multiple divorces), therapy is a badge of honor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how much damage holding in collective trauma did to our parents,\u201d Cordova said. \u201cSo many people are trying to end those cycles of pain by better managing their mental health needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you value honesty and transparency in relationships, you should tell them within the first few dates.\u201d - Kelifern Pomeranz, a psychologist in the Bay Area\n\nIn the Bay Area, where psychologist Kelifern Pomeranz works, having a therapist is akin to having a personal trainer \u2015 commonplace for those who can afford it. (Therapy can be pricey, but if you\u2019re looking for ways to make it more affordable, head here.)\n\nWhile therapy is common, Pomeranz reminds clients that revealing the fact that you\u2019re seeing a therapist depends on your dating goals.\n\n\u201cIs it a casual hookup? Probably not relevant,\u201d she said. \u201cLong-term relationship potential? If you value honesty and transparency in relationships, you should tell them within the first few dates. If it is going to be an issue, it is better to know sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nAs for how to broach the conversation, it might be as easy and casual as saying something like, \u201cHey, my therapist told me something interesting today.\u201d Or maybe you share an interesting breakthrough you made in your last session.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to therapy for trauma, you\u2019ll likely treat this conversation and its timing a little more seriously. As with any potentially sensitive disclosure, it\u2019s important to consider how the subject might be received, said Alicia H. Clark, a psychologist in Washington, D.C.\n\nTo get a sense of how your date might respond, draw on something from pop culture. For instance: \u201cKristen Bell said the smartest thing about depression and going to therapy in this article I was reading,\u201d or, \u201cWhat do you think about the therapy scenes in \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019? Why does everyone in Monterey go to the same damn therapist?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese conversation starters are useful \u2018test balloons\u2019 to throw out to see how a potential partner thinks about therapy,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThis way, you find out without the pressure of them knowing they should say the right thing.\u201d\n\nMostly, don\u2019t overstress it. You don\u2019t have to go into detail about why you go.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with being in therapy and you don\u2019t have to apologize or make excuses for it,\u201d Pomeranz said.", "description": "If you're unsure about how to bring up your experiences with your new partner, here's how to do it.", "authors": ["Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ea5682500008d000207a5.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
