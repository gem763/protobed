He was 95. He will be laid to rest in Harare at the National Heroes Acre, set aside for Zimbabweans deemed to have made significant sacrifices for the nation, which emerged from the end of colonial Rhodesia.\n\n\u201cComrade Mugabe will be buried at the Heroes Acre,\u201d the deputy information minister, Energy Mutodi said. \u201cThat is where he deserves to rest.\u201d\n\nRobert Mugabe obituary Read more\n\nLeo Mugabe, a nephew of Robert Mugabe and a family spokesman, said the date of the funeral and other details, including when Mugabe\u2019s body will be flown into Zimbabwe, were not yet finalised. \u201cArrangements are not in place yet,\u201d he said in a text message.\n\nThe plot, which is located on a hilltop, and built with the help of North Korean architects, features a huge bronze statue of three guerrilla fighters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Heroes Acre shrine, outside Harare.

He was an ex-guerrilla chief who took power in 1980 when Zimbabwe shook off white minority rule and ruled for decades while economic turmoil and human rights violations eroded its early promise.\n\nMugabe was forced to relinquish power by a previously loyal military in November 2017.\n\nFlags flew at half-staff on Saturday, but there were no public activities to mark the death of a man who shaped the once-prosperous country in his own image and created a repressive system that many critics say endures.\n\nZimbabwe's intellectual despot: how Mugabe became Africa's fallen angel Read more\n\nReaction to his death was mixed. The state-run Herald newspaper, which vilified Mugabe when he resigned and when he subsequently voiced support for the opposition, carried glowing tributes.\n\nIn a commemorative edition, the newspaper, which often acts as a mouthpiece of the government, carried a montage of his pictures on its front page and glowing reports throughout.\n\nIn an editorial, the newspaper praised Mugabe for \u201chis uncompromising stance when it came to the rights of Africans\u201d. \u201cWhatever happened towards the end of his leadership should not be used to rubbish the good things that he did during his life,\u201d the commander of the Zimbabwe defence forces and one of the commanders who led the military campaign to oust Mugabe after years of propping his rule, was quoted as saying in a separate story in the newspaper.\n\nOthers were less charitable. \u201c95 and out,\u201d read the privately-owned Newsday newspaper. \u201cDespite his intellectual prowess, Mugabe\u2019s failure to let go of power when it was time was his major undoing. In short, he was a liberator who turned villain. Leaders need to know when to draw the line,\u201d said the newspaper in an editorial.\n\n\u201cEnd of an era as Mugabe dies, leaves Zim poor, divided,\u201d read the front page headline of another privately-owned newspaper, the Daily News. \u201cNotwithstanding the many mistakes that he made, many Zimbabweans will probably agree that had he not held on to power beyond the 1990s, he would today be largely remembered as one of Africa\u2019s best leaders in history,\u201d it said.\n\nBoth newspapers were targets of Mugabe, with editors and reporters routinely arrested during his rule.", "description": "Former leader \u2018deserves\u2019 to be laid to rest at Heroes Acre, in Harare, says government", "authors": ["Associated Press In Harare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852ad0f3a1911a20522fe22b711d427459a3db23/0_895_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5986e4d6da78ab7ffbd721c4715d9bb0", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
