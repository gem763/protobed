Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham reportedly told reporters that someone from FEMA was briefing him on the hurricane every hour.\n\nTrump departed the course at 2:40 PM, according to his schedule, and received his scheduled full briefing at Camp David when he returned.\n\nRead more: T rump's golf outings have reportedly cost taxpayers more than $100 million\n\nThe White House hasn't explicitly acknowledged that Trump was playing golf or who his partners were during his visit to the club.\n\nVideo published by The Hill that is reportedly sourced from CNN footage appears to show Trump on the golf green Saturday.
