We have a solid foundation, sustainable growing power, and we are now building and investing into the future.\u201d\n\nLuring new merchants\n\nIts latest accounts show Tyro received $17.5 billion of payments through its terminals over the past financial year, delivering revenue of $189.8 million, up 28 per cent. Terminal numbers have grown at a compound annual rate of 23 per cent over the past five years. But growth has come at a cost: its loss for the past year was $18.3 million as it spends up to lure new merchants from the majors.\n\nTyro is also pushing harder into software and e-commerce, as it plans on using the banking licence won in 2015 to roll out lending to merchants, a similar strategy to US giant PayPal, which is also building on its payments core by offering small business loans.\n\n\u201cFinancial services globally is going through enormous change,\u201d Mr Thodey said. \u201cEvery part of the financial services sector, from forex to payments to neobanks, right across the world, is being enabled by innovative technology, cloud dynamics and better ways to manage the flow of information in more secure ways.\"\n\nLike Xero, of which he's also a director, Mr Thodey said Tyro has an opportunity to expand abroad. Tyro chief executive Robbie Cooke said a new middleware offering, known as Tyro Connect, was being designed to help retailers accept payments from an expanding array of online delivery services and platforms, and this could potentially be sold internationally.\n\nOpen banking regime\n\nGrowth plans also include pushing its terminals beyond its existing three core sectors of hospitality, retail and health (where its market share is closer to 10 per cent), into accommodation and services, including professional services and tradies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a desire for greater transparency and for the customers to have a different experience because banks have always been a bit of a black box,\u201d Mr Thodey said.\n\nWith the government's open banking regime extending to small business, he said \"data must always be owned by the customer, that's a fundamental principle whether it\u2019s a telco or a bank, and that's the only way to protect privacy and create trust and transparency\".\n\nAfter a career at the big end of town (he was at IBM before Telstra), Mr Thodey said he's fired up taking on the role of disrupter, and has always been \"an incredible believer in the power of technology to create differentiation for the customer and iterative ways of doing things\".\n\nNow he will hope potential investors back the vision.\n\n\"Australia has under-indexed the tech sector: we have had such a strong mining and minerals sector that a lot of risk capital has gone there,\" he said.\n\n\"But software moves quickly around the world and can be a big driver for the economy. We now have an opportunity with global, cloud-enabled platforms and software to do something different, industry by industry.\"\n\nTyro has appointed investment banks JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley and law firm Clayton Utz for the potential float. \u201cWe are getting ready, so we can make the decision, depending on how the market looks,\u201d Mr Thodey said.", "description": "Tyro\u2019s chairman-elect David Thodey says he\u2019s confident the company has laid the foundations to take on its more powerful rivals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3943%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_461%2C$y_279/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ca4c1adc735335aa2720871defe189d35fff3375", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
