I don't even eat meat.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\n\"So until UFC, USADA or whoever is f****** with me fixes it, I won't be competing.\n\n\"I'm not gonna play their game and try and hide it or keep quiet, as they suggested.\n\n\"I'm not gonna have my name tainted as a cheater like these other mother******* who keep quiet until after the fight just so that they can get paid. F***** cheaters.\n\n\"I don't give a f*** about some money over my dignity and my legacy. I'm not playing along with this bull****.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\n\"I'm not staying quiet and figuring it out after the fight. That's cheating.\n\n\"So fight game I'll see you when I see you.\n\n\"Sincerely, the realest baddest mother f***** in the fight game.\"\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nDiaz has twice been beaten by rival Conor McGregor in the past, but the Irishman announced his comeback on Thursday and claimed he wants to fight the winner of Diaz vs Masvidal, which is now in jeopardy.\n\nOutlining the second fight of his three-fight comeback plan, McGregor said: \u201cI will then look to compete against the winner of Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal. Obviously, I have history with Nate Diaz, we are set to have the trilogy bout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how that one goes, I feel Nate will get the better of that one and then we will contest the trilogy bout.\"", "description": "Conor McGregor's former rival Nate Diaz has thrown his career into doubt with an explosive statement", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Zuffa Llc", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12049651.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/UFC-Fight-Night-Alves-v-Millender.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
