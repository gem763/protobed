They claim the undergrowth of the trees are suffering from 'neglect'\n\nThe neighbours asked Fiona Galt to reduce the height of the trees that bored their homes in Dundee\n\nThe dispute has since been examined by Dundee City Council under high hedge laws, which rejected a demand that Mrs Galt axe the trees.\n\nMr Foggie led the complaint and said the arguments over the trees first emerged after a strip of land separating the houses was bought by Mrs Galt in 1995.\n\nMr Foggie said the previous owner had allowed cutting of the Laurel trees but that was halted when Mrs Galt purchased the ground.\n\nHe also claimed attempts at resolving the dispute had failed.\n\nRalph Foggie (pictured above) is believed to have spearheaded the campaign against Ms Galt on the trees\n\nThe growth of a laurel hedge depends on the soil it has been planted on and Ms Galt's neighbours want them to be reduced\n\nHe wrote: 'It is important to point out that following the purchase of the strip of land in 1995 our neighbour visited me to inform me that previous permission to maintain the height of the Laurels was withdrawn.\n\n'The whole area has since been totally neglected and the Laurels in particular allowed to grow freely to unacceptable levels without any consideration of light loss to our respective properties.\n\n'We of course have had no route to have the area managed to acceptable levels until the introduction o the High Hedges Act.\n\n'The loss of natural light is compounded by Laurel shrub overhang preventing full growth of plants and privet hedge along our southern garden area.\n\n'A deep carpet of creeping ivy growing out of control in the neighbour's garden also emphasises the level of neglect and total lack of maintenance.'\n\nIn general the growth of a laurel hedge will depend on the soil the plant has been planted on as well as the conditions for growth.\n\nA common laurel hedge can grow up to 2ft per year.\n\nA decision will be issued in due course.", "description": "The dispute has seen four fed-up homeowners in Dundee complain to their neighbour over the trees in the garden and the complaint has now reached the Scottish Government.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/11/19358666-0-image-a-18_1570358266414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
