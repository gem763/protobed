The captive population is essentially all that now remains.\n\n\"Is make or break time for the species in the UK. This breeding group needs to grow fast now to provide any kind of future\".\n\nAs well as wildcats, he has bred beavers for wildlife trusts to keep in fenced areas, and water voles to be released into the wild.", "description": "The first wildcat kittens in a new project to protect the species will be released in England for the first time in 150 years.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Benedict Spence", "Michael Gove", "Nick Timothy"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/27/EH0Aa73XkAAkmmz-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnbYuKKOR9MdfmCTBUhX495ut9nUk1H7v6_BKIaSlv1w.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
