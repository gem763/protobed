It is pretty similar, the voice I\u2019m gonna do, to Willem\u2019s.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell that\u2019s a pretty special insight into how RPatz is taking on the role, if we do say so ourselves.\n\nAdding a pirate\u2019s \u2018Aaargh!\u2019, the star had a laugh as he said: \u2018I think Batman has a sort of piratey kind of voice \u2013 I think that will really suit it.\u2019\n\nSo it seems he\u2019s taking the mick here and we\u2019re not all that sure he\u2019s going to be riffing on his co-star\u2019s tone any time soon, but it\u2019s made us no less amped for the project.\n\nAnd if you needed a little refresher on what Willem sounds like in The Lighthouse, have a goose and a gander at the trailer one more time:\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nRob took inspiration from Willem\n\nBack to the B-Man, Matt Reeves is set to direct the anticipated blockbuster after taking over from Ben Affleck who stepped down in 2017.

I sort of had an idea to do it, and I\u2019d been prodding Matt [Reeves]. I kept asking to meet him.\u2019\n\nAlthough, he was \u2018furious\u2019 when the news leaked as he hadn\u2019t even auditioned for the role.\n\nHe said: \u2018When that thing leaked, I was f*****g furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\u2019\n\nThe Batman is set to hit cinemas on 25 June 2021.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
