Historically, the company has waited until the technology is fully developed and reliable before adding it.\n\nThat\u2019s why the iPhone 11 can be considered a placeholder until Apple adopts some more-or-less common features from other smartphones.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nMuch of the anticipation I typically feel leading up to a new iPhone announcement revolves around one question: \u201cDid Apple finally add \u2018this\u2019 feature?\u201d\n\nFor the iPhone 11, Apple delivered on some features I expected, like an ultra-wide camera, and a new Night Mode for better photos in low-light situations. And finally, finally, a fast-charger included in the box, at least for the iPhone 11 Pro.\n\nAs for other features I was hoping for, like a universal USB-C port and a super-fast and smooth display, the iPhone 11 didn\u2019t quite deliver.\n\nI can fully understand why Apple didn\u2019t include most of the features below. Many of them might not be ready for Apple\u2019s adoption yet. When Apple feels comfortable enough to add these features, the iPhone will be totally different than it is today. That\u2019s why the iPhone 11 feels a bit more like a placeholder while the company works on adding some key, modern smartphone features to its iPhone.\n\nCheck out the features that some may have expected on Apple\u2019s iPhone 11, but ultimately didn\u2019t make an appearance:\n\nUSB-C\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nUSB-C is the undisputed modern standard when it comes to connecting and charging devices. Almost every Android device has a USB-C port now, and even Apple\u2019s iPad Pros and MacBook Pro laptops have USB-C ports.\n\nBut Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 series all come with Lightning ports, and you could say it\u2019s getting a little old. It would be nice for USB-C iPad and MacBook Pro owners to use the same charger and cables to charge their iPhones, too. Alas, iPhone owners still need a separate Lightning cable to charge the iPhone.\n\nThere have been some improvement to the USB-C situation with the iPhone 11 Pros, however. The \u201cPro\u201d iPhone 11 models come with Apple\u2019s 18W fast-charger and a USB-C-to-Lightning cable. That means you can finally plug an iPhone directly into a USB-C MacBook Pro without using an adapter.\n\nIncluding a USB-C-to-Lightning cable with iPhones is something Apple should have done since 2016, when the company introduced its USB-C-only MacBook Pros. Better late than never, I guess.\n\nA faster, smoother screen\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that would make the iPhone 11 phones \u201cfeel\u201d unstoppable, it would be a 90Hz screen.\n\nThe iPhone 11 has a 60Hz screen, which is fine. But 90Hz screens are faster and smoother, and they make a big impact on how premium the phone feels. It\u2019s not a necessity, but since phones from OnePlus, Razer, and Asus are coming out with 90-plus Hz screens, Apple\u2019s iPhones (and other phones from big names like Samsung) are starting to look outdated, despite all the fancy designs and tech they have.\n\nBut I can see why Apple hasn\u2019t adopted the 90Hz screen. Screens with higher refresh rates can use up more battery. Apple boasts better battery lives on the new iPhone 11 phones, which more people may value over a 90Hz screen, especially when the current 60Hz screen is good enough.\n\nFor reference, \u201cHz\u201d refers to \u201crefresh rate.\u201d The higher the Hz number, the higher the refresh rate, which means the more frames per second a screen can display. With a higher refresh rate and more frames per second, animations like opening and closing apps, as well as swiping around an operating system and apps, look smoother. It makes a surprisingly big impact to how premium a device feels.\n\nA no-notch design\n\nsource Apple\n\nDepending on who you talk to, the divisive notch is either a feature or a placeholder until Apple can figure out how to hide the iPhone\u2019s selfie camera and various Face ID sensors behind the screen.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Apple embraces the notch, or if the company eventually plans to ditch it in favor of a notch-less design without compromising the selfie camera quality and the Face ID sensor.\n\nNotch-less designs are currently possible, like the OnePlus 7 Pro\u2019s no-notch screen that looks stunning. OnePlus was able to hide the selfie camera by making it pop out of the top of the phone when you needed it.\n\nWith that said, Apple\u2019s Face ID facial recognition uses more sensors and is more advanced than a simple selfie camera, and the Face ID sensors occupy quite a lot of space. It\u2019s surely a difficult task to hide so many sensors. It\u2019s apparently so difficult that Google has simply decided to return to the old-fashioned wide top bezel for the Pixel 4, just so that it can include its \u201cSoli\u201d radar technology for the Pixel 4\u2019s upcoming advanced facial recognition.\n\nAn \u201cin-display\u201d fingerprint sensor\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThere is one way that Apple could ditch the notch to offer a no-notch iPhone, but it would likely mean ditching the Face ID sensors, and therefore Face ID.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall ask, but Apple could use in-display fingerprint sensors to unlock the phone and authenticate Apple Pay purchases instead of Face ID. With an in-display fingerprint sensor, there\u2019s arguably no need for Face ID.\n\nI can understand why Apple hasn\u2019t gone down the in-display fingerprint sensor route. The technology simply isn\u2019t quite there yet, at least for things like Apple Pay that demand the utmost security.\n\nI\u2019ve used the secure in-display fingerprint sensors that use ultrasonic technology on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 and Note 10 smartphones, and the experience isn\u2019t as smooth and seamless as it was with old-fashioned fingerprint sensors on bottom phone bezels or backs. The experience is different for different people, but for me, it\u2019s slow and inaccurate.\n\nAt the same time, my first experience with Face ID on the iPhone X put me off the technology entirely. I thought Face ID was slow and inaccurate compared to old-fashioned fingerprint sensors, too. I have yet to try Face ID on newer iPhones, though.\n\nReverse wireless charging, or \u201cbilateral wireless charging\u201d\n\nsource Apple\n\nReverse wireless charging is a recent feature that started popping up on Huawei phones in 2018, and most recently on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 and Note 10 phones in 2019.\n\nThe feature is designed to let you charge other wireless charging devices, like a smartwatch or wireless earbuds, from the back of your phone.\n\nThe iPhone 11 was rumored to include reverse wireless charging, which many said would be a compromise for Apple\u2019s now-cancelled AirPower wireless charging pad. It could have been useful for Apple Watch and AirPod owners.\n\nAlas, reverse wireless charging didn\u2019t make it to the iPhone 11. With that said, it\u2019s rumored that the iPhone 11 phones actually do have reverse wireless charging tech, but it\u2019s disabled by software.\n\nNo 5G support \u2014 but this is totally understandable\n\ncaption YouTuber Marques Brownlee testing 5G on a Samsung Galaxy S10 5G. source YouTube/MKBHD\n\nSome may be disappointed that the iPhone 11 phones don\u2019t support 5G, the latest standard in wireless communications.\n\nIndeed, 5G promises unrivaled speeds that will make waiting for things to happen on your phone a thing of the past.\n\nAt the same time, 5G is rolling out slowly \u2013 slowly enough that 5G is only available in a few cities across the US and the world at the moment. And in cities where it is available, 5G only covers \u201cparts\u201d of those cities, not even the entire city.\n\nWith that in mind, it can be strongly argued that 5G isn\u2019t a \u201cmust-have\u201d feature in 2019, especially if it means higher price tags on smartphones when connection to a 5G network isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nCheck out YouTuber Marques Brownlee\u2019s video on 5G and how it\u2019s great, but not quite here yet:", "description": "Business Insider - The iPhone 11 is holding the door for a future iPhone that will likely have some of the modern features from other smartphones..
