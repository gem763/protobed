A document seen by The Mail on Sunday showed that even members of the group have become concerned, saying that HMRC would \u201ccrawl all over us\u201d and that they expected fines from the government in the range of \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000.\n\nAs of 12:00hrs on Sunday, 13 October, there have been 1,309 arrests in connection with the ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests across London. \u2014 Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) October 13, 2019\n\nConservative MP David Davies called for an investigation into the group\u2019s finances, telling The Mail: \u201cIt is utterly outrageous if Extinction Rebellion is not paying its fair share of tax. These self-appointed, holier-than-thou guardians of the planet may think they are somehow above the law but they are not. What\u2019s needed now is a root-and-branch investigation of how this organisation operates, starting with an immediate inquiry into its tax affairs. I shall be writing to HMRC tomorrow to demand nothing less.\u201d\n\nThe news comes in the wake of over 1,300 arrests of Extinction Rebellion protestors in the last week alone. Nearly 500 protestors were arrested removed from their Trafalgar Square encampment on Tuesday, and more arrested after the group attempted to \u201coccupy\u201d London City Airport.\n\nExtinction Rebellion will conclude its \u2018Autumn Uprising\u2019 protests on Saturday, October 19th.\n\nWatch: Delingpole Savaged by a Tofu-Muncher at the Extinction Rebellion Protest https://t.co/LgAS3wA5TU \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2019", "description": "Extinction Rebellion protestors are paid up to \u00a3400 per week to \u2018shut down\u2019 Britain, with activists paid over \u00a3200,000 since its founding.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/extinction-rebellion-1-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
