Elizabeth Warren is the \u201cclear-cut person to beat\u201d President Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times published Friday, Mr. Soros stopped short of endorsing Ms. Warren, who is polling at 21.8% nationally, second to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, but he said the Massachusetts senator is the \u201cmost qualified\u201d for the presidency.\n\n\u201cShe has emerged as the clear-cut person to beat,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.\u201d\n\nMr. Soros said he\u2019s in favor of \u201ctaxing the rich,\u201d including instituting a \u201cwealth tax\u201d like the one proposed by Ms. Warren, which calls for a tax hike on households with a net worth over $50 million. He said, however, that he doesn\u2019t plan on formally endorsing any candidate ahead of the election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anybody because I want to work with whoever,\u201d he clarified. \u201cI don\u2019t express my views generally because I have to live with whoever the electorate chooses.\u201d\n\nMr. Soros said he\u2019s confident that the political pendulum will swing back in his favor next year, with Mr. Trump contributing to his own \u201cdemise\u201d by putting personal interests above the country.\n\n\u201cTrump is still doing a tremendous amount of damage,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, just the last week what he has done in the Middle East has been devastating for America\u2019s influence in the world,\u201d he said, referring to the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria.\n\nMr. Trump \u201cis an aberration, and he is clearly putting his personal interests ahead of the national interests,\u201d Mr. Soros said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it will contribute to his demise next year,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I am slightly predicting that things will turn around.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
