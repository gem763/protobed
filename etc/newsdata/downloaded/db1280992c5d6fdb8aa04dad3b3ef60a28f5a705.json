REUTERS/Hamad l Mohammed\n\n\u201cBe careful, a limited aggression will not remain limited. We will pursue any aggressor,\u201d the head of the Guards, Major General Hossein Salami, said in remarks broadcast on state TV. \u201cWe are after punishment and we will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday approved sending American troops to bolster Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defences after the Sept. 14 attacks.\n\nIran denies involvement in the attack, which was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement, a group aligned with Iran and currently fighting a Saudi-led alliance in Yemen\u2019s civil war.\n\nTrump\u2019s move drew fire in Washington on Saturday from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called it his \u201clatest outrageous attempt\u201d to circumvent Congress.\n\n\u201cThese unacceptable actions are cause for alarm,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement accusing Trump of turning \u201ca blind eye\u201d to Saudi violence against innocent Yemenis, human rights abuses and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\n\u201cThe United States cannot enable more brutality and bloodshed,\u201d she added. \u201cCongress will do our job to uphold the Constitution, defend our national security and protect the American people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Amirali Hajizadeh, who heads the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 aerospace branch, said any attacks on Iran would receive \u201ca crushing response\u201d, the official news agency IRNA reported.\n\nHajizadeh was speaking at a public exposition called \u201cHunting Vultures\u201d, where remains of drones which were downed in Iran or crashed there were displayed, along with the Iranian air defence system which shot down a U.S. military drone in June.\n\nThe exposition is part of annual events commemorating the start of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, which also includes air and naval displays in the Gulf and military parades on Sunday.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister meanwhile denounced renewed U.S. sanctions against its central bank following the Saudi attacks as an attempt to deny ordinary Iranians access to food and medicine, and said the move was a sign of U.S. desperation.\n\nThe United States on Friday imposed more sanctions, targeting the Central Bank of Iran, which was already under U.S. sanctions, the National Development Fund of Iran - the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund - and an Iranian company that U.S. officials say is used to conceal financial transfers for Iranian military purchases.\n\n\u201cThis is a sign of U.S. desperation ... When they repeatedly sanction the same institution, this means their attempt at bringing the Iranian nation to its knees under \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 has failed,\u201d Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters in remarks shown on state television.\n\n\u201cBut this is dangerous and unacceptable as an attempt at blocking ... the Iranian people\u2019s access to food and medicine,\u201d Zarif said, speaking after arriving in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly next week.\n\nSeparately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi rejected what he called \u201cunreal and repetitious accusations by certain Saudi officials\u201d about the attacks, state media said.\n\nA senior Saudi official said earlier that Riyadh would wait for the results of a probe before responding to the attacks on its oil facilities, for which it believes Iran is responsible.\n\nSANCTIONS\n\nZarif said he would on Wednesday meet foreign ministers of the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was agreed with Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia as well as the United States.\n\n\u201cAs we have said before, the United States can only attend if it returns to the (nuclear accord) ... and ends its economic war against Iran,\u201d Zarif said.\n\nThe United States withdrew from the accord last year and re-imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran.\n\nAfter reports on social media of a cyber-attack on some petrochemical and other companies in Iran, a state body in charge of cyber security denied there had been a \u201csuccessful\u201d attack.\n\n\u201cBased on our observations ... there has not been a successful cyber-attack on oil facilities and other critical infrastructure,\u201d said an official statement carried by IRNA.\n\nNetBlocks, an organisation that monitors internet connectivity, earlier reported \u201cintermittent disruptions\u201d to some internet services in Iran starting on Friday evening.\n\nThe group said the impact was limited, affecting only specific providers, and the cause was unclear. \u201cData are consistent with a cyber-attack or unplanned technical incident on affected networks as opposed to a purposeful withdrawal or shutdown incident,\u201d it said in a tweet.\n\nNetBlocks Director Alp Toker said they saw four Iranian networks falling offline over a three hour period on Friday evening. This began when the first reports emerged and ended shortly afterwards. The networks have been stable since.", "description": "Iran will pursue any aggressor, even if it carries out a limited attack, and seek to destroy it, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday, after attacks on Saudi oil sites which Riyadh and U.S officials blamed on Tehran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432413140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0RT-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
