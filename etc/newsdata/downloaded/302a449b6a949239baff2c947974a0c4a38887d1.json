The feud between Leida, Deavan, and Laura Jallali heats up and almost overshadows the upcoming Tell-All. In the midst of this, Laura still insists she fell pregnant, and it was an ectopic pregnancy and she lost the baby. That comes after allegations by Deavan that Laura lied about being pregnant. Plenty of TLC fans have a lot to say.\n\nAnd, now someone who claims to be an OBGYN weighed in with their thoughts about Laura's claim. And, it seems she thinks Laura's not telling the truth.\n\nA claim by '90 Day Fiance' fan to being an OBGYN - can't be verified\n\nBefore continuing, it should be noted by followers of the TLC show, that the claim by a fan who says they're an OBGYN can't be verified. Nevertheless, their opinion seems to indicate she disbelieves Laura.\n\nThe name of the account on IG is drlibby08. Over on their private account, the profile says, she's a \"PROUD OBGYN\" and indicates that she might be from Kansas.\n\nThe account shows her name as Libby Anne. Well, there are some Dr. Libby people on google search results, but multitudes of them could be this person, or not. That's taking into account people with similar initials as well. So, note that despite researching this, there's no conclusive evidence proving the \"90 Day Fiance\" fan is an OBGYN. So, it really can't be taken as gospel truth.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

This time, one post brought up Laura again talking about her pregnancy. There have been many comments since Laura first claimed an ectopic pregnancy. This time, the \"OBGYN\" reacted to the post after some \"90 Day Fiance\" fans agreed surgery was not always necessary for an ectopic incident.\n\nThe comment by '90 Day Fiance' Laura\n\nFans are unhappy that Laura seems nasty with Deavan who lost her own baby recently.\n\nLaura apparently criticized her because she allowed Leida (an alum from season 3) to babysit for the \"90 Day FianceTell All.\" Deavan claims that Laura said she's a terrible mother for allowing that. Laura denied she said anything horrid and asked fans why they had no sympathy for her baby loss. Once again, she stands by her claim she did suffer an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nA few fans said they caught their own ectopic pregnancies early, and it was done with some kind of medication.\n\nSeveral of them noted that in their instances it worked for them. So, they felt Laura not having painful surgery could be accounted for.

None of her info adds up and every detail she adds only further blows up her claims. 'SOMEBODY' needs 5 point restraints and Ativan STAT!\" Ouch!\n\nWhat do you think about the fan who claims to be an OBGYN disbelieving Laura's claim that she had an ectopic pregnancy?\n\nRemember to follow the Reality TV Channel on Blasting News for more news about the cast of \"90 Day Fiance.\"", "description": "While the feud between Laura, Leida, and Deavan grows, one doc feels Laura's not telling truth about her pregnancy.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Jane Flowers", "Susan B.", "Read More On The Same Topic Jane Flowers", "Day Fiance", "The Other Way ' Fans Choose Who They Want Back In A New Season", "Day Fiance'", "David Toborowsky Weighs In With Teasing About Colt'S Lost Love Post", "Avery Mills Reveals Omar'S American Connections"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/13/os/b_1200x630/90-day-fiance-feud-about-babies-picks-up-a-fan-claiming-shes-an-obgyn-weighs-in-on-laura-image-credit-tlcyoutube_2338423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
