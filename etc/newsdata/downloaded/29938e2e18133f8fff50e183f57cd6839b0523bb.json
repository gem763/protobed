The camera serves two purposes: it\u2019s a dash cam that can constantly record as you drive and save clips whenever it detects an impact or possible accident (there are two microSD slots for storage), and it\u2019s a driver safety device that alerts you when you get too close to the vehicle in front or if you drift outside the painted lines on the road.\n\nThe 6-inch display has a low, WVGA (800 x 480 pixel) resolution that would be laughable on a smartphone or tablet, but it\u2019s fine here. You\u2019re not reading email or watching video on the n\u00fcviCam, and since it\u2019s a few feet away when mounted in your car, you never actually see the pixels of the display. More important than resolution is that the display is visible in bright sunlight, and the n\u00fcviCam doesn\u2019t have any issues there.\n\nIf you used to (or still do) have a GPS unit, it was probably pretty bulky, not very attractive, and it likely had a resistive touchscreen that was obsolete the second the first iPhone was announced. The n\u00fcviCam is none of those things: it\u2019s a sleek, tablet-like device with a big, 6-inch capacitive display and a cool magnetic mount that snaps it to its windshield-mounted dock. It\u2019s metal instead of plastic, and while it\u2019s not as thin as the latest smartphones or tablets, it\u2019s certainly far better than the GPS units of yore. It still has a laughably short 30 minute battery life, which is really just there to let you restart your car without restarting the unit.\n\nThe dash cam functionality has questionable utility. If you\u2019re someone who finds yourself constantly getting into fender benders, it might be useful to have a record of what happened, including audio. But in my time using the n\u00fcviCam, I didn\u2019t get in any accidents (intentional or otherwise) and it mostly just kept a record of when I went over significant bumps in the road.\n\nThe lane guidance and collision detection features of the camera are a bit more interesting, as they are things you typically only see in newer vehicles. I don\u2019t drive a new German luxury car, but with the n\u00fcviCam, even my 12-year-old Toyota Corolla can tell me when I\u2019m getting too close to the person in front of me (when traveling over 30 mph) or drifting outside of the lanes. The n\u00fcviCam will flash yellow warnings and beep loudly whenever I cross the double yellow or solid white lines on the road. It\u2019s not very effective with dotted lines, however; I was able to drift across a three-lane highway without a peep from the n\u00fcviCam. That makes sense: you wouldn\u2019t want to have the thing light up and throw a fit every time you switched lanes on the road, though perhaps a more subtle notification would be appropriate for dotted lines. It\u2019d be more useful if the n\u00fcviCam let me know when a vehicle was in my blind spot on the left or right, but I can\u2019t see how it would do that with its current, single-camera setup.\n\nThe nuvicam can't escape the fact that it's mostly just a GPS unit\n\nBut even with its fancy dashcam and driver safety features, the n\u00fcviCam can\u2019t really escape the fact that it\u2019s still mostly just a GPS unit. Most people should just use their smartphone for navigation in their car (if their car doesn\u2019t already have a built-in system), but even if you have reasons for wanting a dedicated GPS unit, it\u2019s hard to justify spending $400 on this one. Garmin has an entire line of GPS units that cost hundreds of dollars less than the n\u00fcviCam and provide the same level of navigation, just without the dashcam or lane guidance features. And again, those features aren\u2019t good enough to justify the higher price.", "description": "Remember stand-alone GPS units for your car?
