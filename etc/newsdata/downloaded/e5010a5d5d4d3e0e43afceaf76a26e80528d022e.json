Domestic nonfinancial companies had $9.95 trillion in debt outstanding in the second quarter, an increase of $1.2 trillion from just two years ago. At 47% of gross domestic product, the level of corporate debt in relation to the economy has never been so high.\n\nThat certainly sounds ominous, but is it? While some economists, including Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren, have expressed concern about the high level of corporate debt, the general feeling had been that it didn\u2019t represent as great a risk as it appeared at first blush. This is because the debt level of American companies in relation to corporate profits didn\u2019t appear all that high compared with where it was before the past few recessions. On that basis, it seemed as if companies weren\u2019t in danger of struggling to pay off what they owed.\n\nBut in late July, the Commerce Department revised the profit figures economists were using to make their debt-to-income tabulations. After incorporating new and revised corporate tax-return data from the Internal Revenue Service, domestic nonfinancial companies\u2019 net operating surplus\u2014an income measure comparable to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda\u2014was about a tenth lower in the first quarter than previously reported.\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren has expressed concern about corporate-debt loads.

Adjusting for earnings cyclicality and companies\u2019 cash holdings, JPMorgan Chase economist Jesse Edgerton calculates that nonfinancial corporate debt came to 2.24 times Ebitda in the second quarter. That is a bit above the level reached in advance of the last recession, and approaching the levels reached before the previous two downturns.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that a recession is in the offing, and investors can take some solace in the fact that paying off debt isn\u2019t so onerous as it once was. Investment-grade corporate-bond yields are at their lowest levels since the 1950s, and many companies have taken advantage of the low-rate environment by refinancing their debt. Mr. Edgerton calculates that interest-coverage ratios are broadly in keeping with where they have been for the past 25 years.\n\nStill, high corporate-debt levels represent a vulnerability. If demand shows signs of faltering, companies could be quicker to ratchet down spending and hiring than they would be if they weren\u2019t so indebted, putting the economy at risk. If a recession hits, as eventually one will, riding out the downturn could become a whole lot harder.\n\nWrite to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "description": "High levels of corporate debt didn\u2019t look so bad because profits were so high.
