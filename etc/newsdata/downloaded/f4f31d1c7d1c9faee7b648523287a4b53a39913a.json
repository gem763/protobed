REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nAfter a freeze during months of sometimes violent protests, Asia\u2019s top financial hub looks to be back in business. The stock market is off its lows, Hong Kong\u2019s love affair with property is undimmed and companies are forging ahead with listing plans. Budweiser Brewing Company APAC (1876.HK) raised about $5 billion in its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, making it the second largest IPO in the world this year.\n\nBankers say at least three more major companies are set to list in Hong Kong this month, selling more than $3 billion (\u00a32.44 billion) worth of new shares.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s status as a gateway for global capital flowing into and out of China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, has seen many global banks and fund managers make its towering skyscrapers their regional homes.\n\n\u201cHow does this (unrest) affect you buying exposure to a good asset that has presence in China, and is growing? None of those things have any correlation with the Hong Kong protests,\u201d said a senior banker with a global investment bank.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have received even one phone call saying \u2018we shouldn\u2019t be doing this IPO because of what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong\u2019,\u201d said the banker, declining to be named due to sensitivity of the issue.\n\nCompanies raised $15 billion in new listings in Hong Kong in the first nine months of 2019, second only to New York, according to Refinitiv data. While the protests have hurt tourism and retail sectors, threatening to send Hong Kong into its first recession in a decade, its proximity to the massive Chinese market and locally listed firms\u2019 presence there are more important, bankers and analysts say.\n\nAlready, the Hong Kong stock market has shown signs of steadying after initial falls as equity investors look for bargain hunting opportunities, they said.\n\nThe benchmark Hang Seng stock index .HSI rallied about 1.4% last month, but is still down 6.1% since mid-June when the unrest began.\n\n\u201cI think people are getting used to the weekly events,\u201d Steven Leung, executive director for institutional sales at brokerage UOB Kay Hian, said of the protests. \u201cThe impact was seen in the initial one to two months in share prices, and mostly in retail, property and tourism,\u201d he said. \u201c(But) the index mostly reflects onshore Chinese market and economy. Hong Kong companies\u2019 share is not that big.\u201d\n\nFUNDRAISING NEEDS\n\nWhat started as protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial have evolved into broader calls for greater democracy, among other demands in Hong Kong.\n\nDemonstrators are frustrated at what they see as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip over the former British colony, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nAfter the initial nervousness about the unrest, things are looking up again in the financial markets, partly aided by hopes that Beijing would not take any step that would imperil the prospects of its only offshore financial centre, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether people think there is a replacement. Hong Kong still has quite a big investor pool,\u201d said Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis.\n\nAs many as 40 companies have filed IPO applications with the Hong Kong stock exchange in September, according to information available on its website, the highest pace of filing since March this year.\n\nIn addition to the Budweiser APAC IPO, Topsports International Holdings, the sportswear business of Chinese footwear retailer Belle International, last week launched a Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.2 billion. Companies expected to launch Hong Kong IPOs within a month include ESR Cayman Ltd, a developer and manager of logistics facilities, planning to raise about $1 billion, and a $1 billion-plus float of Prague-based consumer lender Home Credit. ESR and Home Credit declined to comment.\n\n\u201cA deal can always get done if the price is right, no matter what the market conditions are,\u201d said James Wang, co-head of equity capital markets in Asia ex-Japan, at Goldman Sachs, referring to the broader IPO market. \u201cAn IPO\u2019s timetable is driven more by the company\u2019s need to raise capital so in most cases, market conditions have to be severe to override that need and delay a deal.\u201d\n\nSOLID DEMAND\n\nInvestors including sovereign wealth funds and large global funds that invested in recent offerings are enthused by the lower valuations as well as long term business prospects, bankers said.\n\nBudweiser, which relaunched its IPO last month after cancelling plans for a bigger float in July, priced the offering at the low end of the indicative range.\n\nE-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA.N) in August also delayed plans for a $15 billion listing in Hong Kong because of the political turmoil.\n\nBut such caution has not badly dented the demand for new and listed stocks.\n\nIn another sign of solid demand, net purchases on southbound stock connect that allows mainland-based investors to buy Hong Kong stocks - reached $8 billion in August, the most since January 2018. Other markets in Hong Kong are also holding up.\n\nDemand from homebuyers in the world\u2019s most expensive property market has shown little signs of weakening due to the protests. Property firm Wheelock (0020.HK) sold 80% of its 816 flats in the development since late August, lower than sales at other launches this year, but \u201cstill good\u201d given the current environment, property agents said.\n\nStill, other factors including the U.S.-Sino trade war and slowing global growth have been affecting financial markets and asset prices in Hong Kong, as they have elsewhere.\n\nSean Taylor, APAC chief investment officer at fund manager DWS said Hong Kong could benefit more than most if China and the United States reach an agreement on trade. In the meantime, investors needed to be patient.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to accept the situation that tourism levels are down, retail sales are down, property prices may come down a bit \u2013 you\u2019re going to be in a slow environment for a while,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n(Chart - MSCI HK, China, Asia ex-Japan rebased link: here)\n\nAn anti-government protester throws a molotov cocktail during a demonstration on China's National Day, in Wong Tai Sin, Hong Kong, China October 1, 2019.
