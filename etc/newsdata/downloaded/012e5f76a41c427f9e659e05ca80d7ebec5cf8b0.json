Council Member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), who introduced the bill to ban flavored e-cigarettes. \u201cThe industry targets young people with blatantly youth appealing flavors like cotton candy and gummy bears, and the strategy works.\u201d\n\nAnti-tobacco advocates are pressing states and localities to restrict e-cigarettes, even though the federal government is already doing so.\n\nE-cigarettes spawn teen addiction worrying doctors, parents and schools\n\n\u201cThe tobacco industry will do everything it can to delay, weaken and defeat the FDA\u2019s proposal and is certain to challenge it in court,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cThat means it\u2019s more important than ever for cities and states to protect kids by prohibiting the sale of all flavored e-cigarettes.\u201d\n\nThe District already has some of the nation\u2019s toughest tobacco laws with a smoking age of 21, nearly $5 in taxes on a pack of cigarettes and a prohibition on vaping in bars.\n\nE-cigarettes have been pitched as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes because vaping involves heating nicotine into inhalable vapor without tar and other chemicals. But nicotine remains addictive and vaping has been linked to lung disease, according to federal data.\n\nMaryland, Virginia are among states reporting vaping-related illness\n\nGregory Conley of the American Vaping Association said bans on flavored e-cigarettes are misguided because the flavors are also attractive to adults looking to stop using traditional cigarettes.\n\n\u201cA ban on flavored vaping products will lead to fewer adults quitting and will not succeed at impeding youth access,\u201d Conley said in an email.\n\nCheh said she is not convinced that adults need fruity flavors to make the switch.\n\n\u201cEven if there were some narrow slice of adults for whom that would be determinative, it\u2019s more important we protect the children,\u201d Cheh said.\n\nShe said she is also considering legislation to prohibit vaping and similar shops from opening within a half-mile of a school, in response to a store that recently opened within walking distance of Alice Deal Middle School and Woodrow Wilson High School in her district.\n\nA majority of the Council introduced the flavored e-cigarette ban, including Cheh, Gray, Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), David Grosso (I-At Large), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Anita Bonds (D-At Large) and Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8).\n\nGray\u2019s bill to restrict e-cigarette sales to pharmacies and marijuana dispensaries had less support, with Grosso, Cheh, Allen and Bonds co-introducing it.\n\nAides to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) did not return a request for comment.\n\nFDA unveils sweeping anti-tobacco measures to curb youth vaping\n\nIn a statement, Juul said the company would \u201ccontinue to combat youth usage, while supporting reasonable access to vapor products for adults looking to switch from combustible cigarettes.\u201d\n\nThe council also voted Tuesday to authorize the city to petition D.C. Superior Court to enforce subpoenas in an internal ethics probe of D.C. Council Member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2).\n\nEvans is also the target of federal grand jury investigation into possible conflicts between his public duties and his private business interests.\n\nCouncil Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), said the move was necessary because key witnesses in the investigation refused to comply with subpoenas issued by a law firm hired by the council to investigate Evans.\n\nEvans, who has cooperated with investigators, did not recuse himself from the vote on Tuesday. He cast the lone \u201cno\u201d vote, citing his earlier opposition to the investigation.\n\nLawmakers also introduced bills to overhaul the District\u2019s minority and local business contract preference program and to extend rent control rules set to expire next year.\n\nIn deadly rowhouse fire, D.C. agencies missed repeated chances to save lives\n\nBowser leads statehood rally as House hearing nears\n\nWhen a black-owned funeral home in gentrifying D.C. has no one else to bury\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The measures come as President Trump pledges a nationwide e-cigarette crackdown.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
