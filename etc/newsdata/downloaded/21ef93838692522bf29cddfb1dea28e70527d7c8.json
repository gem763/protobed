On top of that, the tourist tax will come to \u20ac15.97 -- \u20ac9.97 for the room tax plus \u20ac3 per occupant.\n\nIn Berlin, where the tourist tax is 5%, the most expensive hotel on that date -- the Hotel Adlon Kempinski, where past guests include Barack Obama, Angelina Jolie and Michael Jackson, who infamously dangled his baby off a balcony there -- charges \u20ac249.35 for the room, and \u20ac11.65 in tourist tax.\n\nRome currently has the highest fixed price tax in Europe, at \u20ac7 per person per night in a five star hotel. That means that even a room at the Hotel de Russie, which costs \u20ac815 on March 28, will incur a lower levy -- \u20ac14 -- than the one-star Amsterdam property.\n\nDortmund in Germany has the highest percentage tourist tax, at 7.5% of the cost of a room. That same night, staying at the most expensive hotel in Dortmund -- the Fountain Loft, which costs \u20ac249.02 -- will incur just \u20ac14.02 in tourist tax.\n\nEven in January, the lowest season, a night at Booking.com's top rated one-star hotel in Amsterdam -- the Hotel International -- will incur a higher tourist tax than staying in one of Paris's 11 \"palais\" hotels -- those judged so \"exceptional\" that they are beyond five stars.\n\nIn January, a room for two at Hotel International would cost \u20ac62, plus \u20ac4.05 tourist tax and \u20ac6 for both occupants.\n\nIn contrast, the Mandarin Oriental Paris -- which costs \u20ac1,435 for a room on the same night -- would charge just \u20ac10 in tourist tax for two.\n\nChildren under 16 are exempt from the new Amsterdam levy, and campsites will charge just \u20ac1 per adult.\n\nAnd if you're staying in an Airbnb or rental property, don't think you'll be exempt -- instead, the existing tax will be raised to 10% of your rental.\n\nRelated content How Amsterdam is fighting back against mass tourism\n\nA city on the brink\n\nAmsterdam is banning tours of the red light district Anoek De Groot/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmsterdam has been plagued by overtourism, with 18 million annual visitors descending on its 867,000 residents.\n\nThe authorities have taken measures to deter overzealous tourists, by dismantling the \"iamsterdam\" sign -- a former selfie spot -- outside the Rijksmuseum in December 2018 and announcing a ban of \"disrespectful\" tours of the red light district in March 2019.\n\nThat ban -- as well as a cap on group numbers in the medieval center to 15 people -- comes into effect January 1 2020.\n\nNow the extra charges will join them on New Year's Day.\n\nA spokesperson for Amsterdam city council denied that the raised taxes were planned to deter tourists, calling it a point of \"principle\" to make visitors pay their way in the city.\n\n\"Visitors will contribute more to the high costs of keeping the city safe and clean, and of keeping the public space like pavements, quays, bridges and streets, in a good state,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe move follows an agreement in 2018 to increase tourism revenue from \u20ac80m to \u20ac105. The city board had pressed for the additional \u20ac3 charge, and it was ratified by the city council in July.\n\nAmsterdam also imposes a \u20ac8 arrival tax for visitors who arrive by boat, and \u20ac0.66 for passengers taking a sightseeing boat or bus tour.\n\nTaxes that have \"impact\"\n\nJustin Francis, CEO of Responsible Travel, hailed the move as a positive step. He told CNN: \"Our right to travel simply does not outweigh the rights of local people to enjoy their homes, or the need to preserve the environment. Tourist taxes need to be set at a level that will have an impact.\"\n\nTim Fairhurst, director of policy for the ETOA (European Tourism Association), said:\n\n\"Annual increases are not news, but their relentless rise is cause for concern. Flat-rate tax increases are regressive, disproportionately affecting lower-priced accommodation and the visitors who stay there.\n\n\"In addition to ensuring clear benefit is felt, the city must do more to help operators and suppliers plan ahead. Such short-notice increases cannot easily be passed on, and cut commercial margins in what is already an economically stressed industry.\"\n\nAlso next year, Venice has announced plans to introduce a daily entrance fee of up to \u20ac10 on peak season days -- but it is expected to hit day-trippers, and be waived for those staying overnight (who already pay a tourist tax of up to \u20ac5 per person per night.", "description": "The Dutch capital has added a \u20ac3 per person rate to its current 7% tax on hotel rooms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190315131613-07-netherlands-happiest-coutries-2018-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
