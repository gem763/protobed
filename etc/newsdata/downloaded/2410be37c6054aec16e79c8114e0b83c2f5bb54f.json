(Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press)\n\nIn the report, Viens said it is \"impossible to deny\" Indigenous Peoples are victims of \"systemic discrimination\" in accessing public services.\n\nHe said improvements are needed across the spectrum, including in policing, social services, corrections, justice, youth protection and mental health services, as well as to the school curriculum to properly reflect the history of First Nations and Inuit in the province.\n\nViens's inquiry was launched in 2016 by the then-Liberal government, following a Radio-Canada investigation into allegations of police misconduct against Indigenous women in Val-d'Or, a city 500 kilometres northwest of Montreal.\n\nIndigenous leaders and advocates welcomed the apology from the premier, but they also stressed the importance of making concrete changes to government services.\n\n\"We've been ready for many, many years to work with the government. And now, this announcement today, we'll see how far it'll go,\" said Verna Polson, grand chief of the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council.\n\nShe called on the premier to ensure the women who came forward in Val-d'Or aren't overlooked, as well.\n\n\"The women, they need their justice. We're always going to talk about it. We're always going to push for it.\"", "description": "Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u00a0has apologized for how Quebec has treated Indigenous Peoples, following through on the first of 142 recommendations in a damning report that concluded they are subject to \"systemic discrimination.\"", "authors": ["Benjamin Shingler Covers Politics", "Immigration", "Social Issues For Cbc Montreal.
