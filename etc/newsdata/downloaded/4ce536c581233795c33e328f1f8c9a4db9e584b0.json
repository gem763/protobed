Of course it can.\"\n\nMacri lost serious ground in the Aug. 11 primary election to Peronist opposition candidate Alberto Fernandez, who is now widely expected to win the election. The stunning results of the primary - a nearly 16-point lead by Fernandez- sparked a market sell-off and eventually led the government to introduce currency controls in order to stop a slide in the peso currency.\n\nOn Saturday supporters held blue and white balloons, waved Argentine flags and carried signs reading \"yes, we can,\" the slogan Macri has used in his social media posts to garner support for his campaign.\n\nThe march, which was also attended by several prominent politicians from Macri's coalition, represents his first major campaign effort since his primary election defeat. Recent polling predicts that Fernandez has enough support to win the election outright in October.\n\nThe next march for Macri's campaign is scheduled for Monday in Buenos Aires province, with others scheduled later in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces.", "description": "Argentina's Macri launches election push with Buenos Aires march", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8R0T4_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
