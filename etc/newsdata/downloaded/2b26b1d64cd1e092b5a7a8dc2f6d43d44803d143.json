I think she did it. Sadly I really do. It's a shame as she probably didn't think she was going to get caught out.\n\n\"I think that if she was feeding the press, maybe she would get more headlines for herself.

She is just fuming that I 'didn't get Jamie recruiting' for her like she asked me to...\"\n\nAnd then Danielle accused her of being The Sun's Secret Wag columnist who anonymously writes scathing articles about footballers' wives and girlfriends.\n\nShe posted: \"@RebekahVardy do you mean like how the sun recruited you Luv! #secretwag.\n\n\"We are all entitled to our opinions and we all know it came from your account.\ufe0f Attacking me won\u2019t take that away another low blow by you #notagirlsgirl.\"\n\nNicola McLean\n\nTeam Rebekah\n\nNicola McLean, 38, came out in support of Rebekah on The Jeremy Vine Show on Thursday morning.\n\nShe claimed her mate \"cannot stop crying\" and has been forced to take her kids out of school because of the backlash.\n\nThe 38-year-old, who is married Tom Williams, said: \"I don't know Coleen but I do know Rebekah and what she's going through is what nobody should have to go through so publicly.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"She's got people saying they hope her baby dies inside her, she's seven months pregnant, she's had to take her daughter out of school.\"\n\nNicola believes all of the memes and trolling isn't justified, and thinks people should stop talking about the issue until it's proven that it was Rebekah behind the leaks.\n\nShe added: \"She's devastated she doesn't see the funny side of this but we're all sitting here and laughing about it.\"\n\nLizzie Cundy\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nNeutral\n\nDespite believing Coleen has \"100% proof\" of Rebekah's actions, Lizzie Cundy, 49, is on the fence.\n\nSpeaking on This Morning, she said she hoped to mediate between the pair.\n\nShe said: \"I just hope we can sort this out. I think we should sit round a table and get to the bottom of it rather than get all legal and public.\n\n\"Coleen is a very honest and lovely girl. She would never have gone and outed someone publicly like this if she didn't have 100% proof.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nLizzie, who was married to former Chelsea striker Jason Cundy, admitted she was shocked by the revelations.\n\nShe added: \"I couldn't quite believe it.

Things that he'd bought me, places we'd been, things I was wearing were popping up in the newspapers.\n\n\"It is heartbreaking to think that someone so close to you would sell stories and leak things like that so I totally get where [Coleen's] coming from.\"", "description": "Coleen accused Rebekah of selling stories about her after she allegedly caught her lifting posts from a private account", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Rebekahvardy Twitter", "Twitter", "Daily Mirror", "Itv", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549587.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-Wales-Euro-2016-Stade-Bollaert-Delelis-16616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
