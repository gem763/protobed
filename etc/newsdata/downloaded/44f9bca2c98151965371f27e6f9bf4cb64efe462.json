The Houthi authorities are also placing restrictions on imports.\n\n\u201cAs a result, ships carrying fuel have stopped docking, and prices have shot up due to the lack of supply,\u201d the group said.\n\nThat has meant in the Yemeni capital Sanaa petrol prices have tripled since August, it added.\n\nThe soaring costs have meant that 11 million people relying on water supplied by piped networks and four million people who depend on water trucked in by private companies have seen a massive drop in heir water supply.\n\nCentral water systems have completely shut down in three major cities, Ibb, Dhamar and Al Mahwit, home to around 400,000 people.\n\nAirstrikes and shelling have also worsened the crisis. Eight of the water systems installed by Oxfam been damaged or destroyed in the fighting, cutting off water supplies to more than a quarter of a million people.\n\nAttempts at a ceasefire have reached a deadlock. This is despite the fact that United Arab Emirates - a leading partner in the Saudi-led coalition - announced a drawdown of its presence in Yemen in the summer.\n\nThe UN has warned hopes are still \u201cfragile\u201d and reported that September was the deadliest month for civilians in Yemen this year with reports of 388 killed or injured.\n\nMeanwhile the fighting has been complicated by an entirely new and separate conflict within the anti-Houthi fighting coalition.\n\nSouthern separatists, trained and armed by the UAE, seized Aden, the country\u2019s de facto capital, from government forces in August.\n\nThe Southern Transitional Council, which is leading the fight for southern independence, is still in talks with Hadi\u2019s government to hammer out an agreement.", "description": "15 million people in Yemen are at risk of deadly diseases like cholera after their water supplies have been severely cut, Oxfam has warned.
