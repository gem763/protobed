Bowie 3 years and 10 months.\"\n\nCharley, who plays Debbie Dingle in the ITV soap, then took to her Story to share a picture of her eldest son Buster who also appeared to had a trip to the hairdresser.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Buster dressed himself this morning,\" she told her followers, alongside a pic of her boy clad in a purple jumper and striped leggings while holding a matching purple umbrella.\n\nCharley, who also has three-month old Ace with her partner Matthew Wolfenden, often shares pictures of her boys to her social media.\n\nShe recently revealed how she had come under fire from cruel trolls and mummy-shamers after letting her sons' hair grow long.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShe explained: \"I get asked so many times on here why my kids have got long hair. \u2018Why don\u2019t you cut it?\u2019 Or, \u2018they look like girls\u2019. The answer is really simple, because we like it and more importantly they like it.\n\n\"I absolutely don\u2019t feel like I need to explain it to anyone who has an opinion but I just think life would be so much easier if we all just focused on our own lives. Don\u2019t let my kids hair worry you.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe mum went on: \"I think people think they have a right to have an opinion because of social media. Maybe you do. But try keeping it to yourself, it\u2019s not important to us what you think of how our kids look. Or how we look. Or their names or whatever it is you might want to comment on.\n\n\u201cI was always taught, if you\u2019ve got nothing nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all. Try practicing it peeps. There\u2019s enough awful stuff in the world without being mean to each other. They\u2019ve got another t shirt that says, I\u2019m a boy, I\u2019ve just got better hair than you. True dat.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram/CharleyWebb)\n\nCharley then decided to spoil her middle child Bowie by taking him to the spa with her.\n\n\"Like Mother. Like Son,\" she wrote, alongside a snap of her son getting his hair washed.", "description": "The Emmerdale actress said a small minority of followers said her eldest sons looked like girls", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Instagram", "Getty Images", "Instagram Charleywebb"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article20638062.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_charley-social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
