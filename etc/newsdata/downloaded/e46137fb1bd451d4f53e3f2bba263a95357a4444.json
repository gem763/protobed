The situation was worsened recently by three major train breakdowns.\n\nAnd Mr Panelo's boss, President Duterte, was not spared from criticism, either.\n\nHis government recently bought an ex-US military plane for $39.9m (\u00a332m), to use as his private jet.\n\nThe government said the jet, set to be delivered next year, would also be used by other senior officials and in crisis situations. But that didn't pacify some Filipinos.\n\n\"Manila traffic is getting worse and worse and [the administration] is rewarding themselves with junkets and jets. It's insane,\" said one tweet.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Filipinos at a traffic light in Manila\n\nManila - which, in the wider metropolitan area, has a population of more than 12 million - is one of the most densely populated cities in the world.\n\nIt suffers from gridlock and in 2015 was named the worst city to drive in. But Mr Panelo seemed less than sympathetic.\n\n\"What do they mean by transportation crisis? I just see traffic,\" local media quoted him as saying.\n\n\"There is transportation, we all manage to get a ride. People get to where they need to go.\n\n\"There is a solution here, if you want to arrive early (at) your destination, then you go there earlier.\"\n\nHis comments were not received well.\n\nRead more about the traffic in Manila:\n\n\"There is a transport crisis in Manila, there always has been,\" student activist John Gemuel Maramba told the BBC.\n\n\"Students leave at 5am for an 8am class. Millions rely on public transport to get to school and work, yet are subjected to the horrors of excruciatingly slow traffic, overcrowded public vehicles and malfunctioning trains.\n\n\"There is a lot of stress and rage that stems from the poor systems.\"\n\nThe traffic problem was compounded recently by three major train breakdowns - leaving some commuters with no choice but to walk the remainder of their journeys.\n\nMany Filipinos took to social media to express outrage at Mr Panelo's \"insensitive\" remarks and air their views about the \"failing\" system.\n\n\"The mass transportation crisis is real,\" wrote one Twitter user. \"Don't agree with some high official who tells who otherwise, who himself doesn't even use public transportation to get around.\"\n\nAnother tweeted: \"On a scale of 1 to Sal Panelo, how out of touch with reality are you?\"\n\nActivists and political groups also hit back at Mr Panelo's \"ignorance\" about the \"daily sufferings\" faced by commuters.\n\n\"It only shows that he, as a palace official, obviously has no knowledge of the lives of commuter and mass transport crisis,\" said the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) alliance.\n\nStrong words also came from transport activists on Facebook. One wrote: \"He knows nothing about our hell commutes.\"\n\nMr Panelo has since promised to take public transportation to the presidential palace on Friday.\n\n\"The challenge to commute is accepted,\" he said. \"I'll take the jeepney [a type of bus] and the train in going to work.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @NiccoDoesStuff Hello fellow taxpayers, we just bought Duterte a jet.\n\n\n\nCant wait to celebrate the fact when i get in a really old jeepney that's about to be replaced with a new unit that no average person could pay for. \u2014 Niccolo Manahan, but spooky \ud83d\udc7b (@NiccoDoesStuff) October 8, 2019 Report\n\nMany Filipinos also brought up President Rodrigo Duterte's private plane.\n\n\"The budget for health and education was cut for this,\" tweeted medical student Iya Elago.\n\nThe resentment continued on Facebook, with many Filipinos sharing their experiences of commuting in Manila.\n\n\"Allow at least two hours for travel one way,\" said Manuel Cortez in a top comment on Facebook. \"Leave your family and work and don't rest anymore. That's quality life.\"\n\nBut one commenter did offer a solution - for her, at least.\n\n\"I just work from home,\" she said. \"It eliminates the need for me to deal with people and stress.\"", "description": "In one of the world's most gridlocked cities, the president's spokesman says: \"Leave earlier.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A286/production/_109160614_gettyimages-1166897620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
