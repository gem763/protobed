Now Its Rising and Analysts Are Upbeat.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nCostco Wholesale stock, which had edged down in premarket trading Friday, were moving higher after Wall Street analysts defended the retailer\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter report.\n\nCostco stock (ticker: COST) has climbed more than 40% in 2019, well ahead of the S&P 500\u2019s 16% gain. The company has won praise for a string of good sales reports, its overseas expansion plans, competitive positioning in the grocery space, and strong management. (Barron\u2019s named Costco\u2019s CEO one of the world\u2019s best this spring). Valuation remains a concern, although it doesn\u2019t bother bulls who point to Costco\u2019s continued success.\n\nReturns like that, however, can raise expectations to the point where even a small miss on, say, sales, can be too much. And that was the case for Costco. Late Thursday, Costco reported fourth-quarter results, saying it earned $2.69 a share on revenue of $47.5 billion in its fourth quarter, while analysts were looking for EPS of $2.55 and revenue of $47.7 billion. (The company\u2019s bottom line excluded a 22 cents per-share tax assessment.) Comparable sales rose 5.1% in the quarter: U.S. same-store sales climbed 6.1%, while online sales were up 19.8%.\n\nCostco stock dropped 1.3% in after-hours trading following the release but was up 0.7% to $291.04 at 11:42 a.m. Friday. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% at 2936.50, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 225.29 points, or 0.9%, to 26,426.33.\n\nMaybe it has something to do with the analyst reaction? While the market appeared to be disappointed early on, they found plenty to like about the quarter.\n\nCowen & Co.\u2019s Oliver Chen kept his Outperform rating and $325 price target intact. \u201cWe continue to believe COST is better positioned to handle dislocation in a rising tariff environment with recession risk,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nGordon Haskett\u2019s Chuck Grom reiterated an Accumulate rating and $330 price target, writing that \u201c with renewal rates at all time highs, favorable gross profit margin performance, and continued strong top-line momentum on its side, we continue to view Costco as a core holding.\u201d\n\nStifel\u2019s Mark Astrachan has a Buy rating and $310 price target on the shares. \u201cOverall we view the result as solid and reflective of Costco\u2019s continued focus on improving the customer value proposition to drive sales growth which increases earnings flexibility,\u201d he said.\n\nTelsey Advisory Group\u2019s Joseph Feldman reiterated an Outperform rating and raised his price target by $10 to $315 following the report. \u201cCostco is operating at a high level, and better than most in retail,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe continue to expect Costco to remain a share gainer, with its solid sales and traffic trends, high membership renewal rates, and square footage growth of low-single digits.\u201d\n\nJefferies\u2019 Christopher Mandeville is one of the few analysts with a Hold rating on Costco stock but even he found something to like. \u201cRenewal rates have reached all-time highs and the Costco brand is resonating w/ consumers domestically and abroad,\u201d he writes. Concerns about tariffs and valuation keep him on the sidelines.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "The giant retailer released its results for its fiscal fourth quarter late on Thursday.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-78993/social", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
