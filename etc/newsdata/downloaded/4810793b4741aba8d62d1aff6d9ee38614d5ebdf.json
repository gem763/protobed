At least 5 million are buried there in this city of crypts and brick boxes covering more than 1,000 hectares. Wadi Al-Salam, which means \u201cValley of Peace\u201d in Arabic, also has strong claims to being the world\u2019s oldest graveyard, having been in use for over 1,400 years.\n\nWadi Al-Salam graveyard in Najaf, Iraq, is the world\u2019s largest and oldest cemetery. Five million people are thought to be buried here.\n\nImam Ali, the founder of Shia Islam, is buried there, so many Shiites from Iraq and beyond choose Najaf as their final resting place. Proximity to Ali is believed to lead to his intercession, shortening the suffering of the grave and reducing the period between death and resurrection.\n\nThe gravediggers who make Najaf cemetery work are often following in their fathers' footsteps.\n\nFour hundred undertaker offices service the site. Staff share camaraderie, a macabre sense of humour and the perspective they gain from encountering death every day. One gravedigger has worked there for 60 years. He explains how his time as a soldier during the Iran-Iraq war erased all his fear of dying. At that time, the number of burials in Najaf surged, as it did again during the Kuwait war, the American occupation and most recently during the ISIS insurgency.\n\nIn recent years, the numbers buried in Najaf have shot up. The deceased are often members of militias who died fighting US forces or ISIS.\n\nOne section belongs to the \u201cSaraya Salam\u201d militia, formerly known as the \u201cMahdi Army\u201d that rose up to resist US forces in Iraq and then started fighting ISIS. All too frequent military funerals highlight the insurgency\u2019s high cost in young human lives. A militia spokesman tells RTD how he ended up joining the group and what he believes needs to happen to stem the flow of bodies into Najaf.\n\nWorking as a gravedigger requires physical strength and detachment but also tact.\n\nYoung grave diggers are tactfully professional when mourners are carried away by their grief. They admit it was lack of prospects, as well as family-tradition, that drove them to the occupation. Still, they dream of different lives for their children, far away from Wadi Al-Salam.", "description": "The world\u2019s largest and oldest graveyard, Wadi Al-Salam cemetery in Najaf, Iraq, is filling up, because of the country\u2019s endless wars.
