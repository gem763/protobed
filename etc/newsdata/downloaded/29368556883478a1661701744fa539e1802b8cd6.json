REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\n\nPrevious European Commissions have resisted calls, led by steelmakers and traditionally protectionist France, for a carbon levy on imports to protect Europe\u2019s relatively clean and expensive manufacturers from competition from cheaper production elsewhere.\n\nBut fresh momentum has come from increased prices in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the European Union\u2019s flagship instrument for making polluters pay, as well as a rising tide of protectionism led by the United States.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Benchmark European carbon price - here)\n\nUntil now, the Commission has handed out free ETS permits to tackle industry\u2019s complaints it is subject to \u201ccarbon leakage,\u201d the term used to refer to the possibility high EU compliance costs will drive manufacturing to lower-cost parts of the world.\n\nBut from 2021, companies will receive fewer free permits, boosting their costs just as they face investing in expensive new technology to enable the EU to reach a goal of climate neutrality by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement on curbing global warming.\n\nSome lawyers say the Commission must be prepared to be pulled into trade conflicts or European industry will be destroyed.\n\n\u201cEither the EU prepares itself for and accepts the risk of retaliation or it simply allows other countries to continue with a major artificial advantage which will increasingly destroy EU manufacturing,\u201d Laurent Ruessmann, Brussels-based partner at Fieldfisher law firm, said.\n\nHistory suggests major powers will respond if the Commission\u2019s proposal ever becomes law.\n\nThe United States, China, Russia and other foreign governments, accused the EU of acting beyond its jurisdiction when it tried to include international aviation in the EU ETS.\n\nThe attempt to charge all aircraft for their pollution led to threats from China to withhold multi-billion-dollar orders for Airbus aircraft, forcing the EU to suspend the law in 2012.\n\nThe United States mission in Brussels, which follows EU policy on behalf of the U.S. government, said it had no comment. No-one from the Chinese government could be reached for comment.\n\nRussian industry leaders said they were introducing their own measures to curb emissions following Russia\u2019s ratification of the Paris climate accord and in principle any EU tax could be discriminatory.\n\n\u201cThe ratification of the Paris Agreement, in my opinion, suggests that we cannot be discriminated against,\u201d Alexandra Panina, head of the Russian Council of Electric Power Producers, said.\n\nPanina is also a member of the management board of InterRAO, which supplies power to EU countries, namely the Baltic states.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF DESIGN\n\nMuch could depend on the design of any border tax, which so far is entirely unclear and in any case would require years of EU policy-drafting and debate to become law.\n\nIn policy guidelines, Ursula von der Leyen, the German president-elect of the new Commission, said she would introduce a carbon border tax, starting with selected sectors.\n\nAcknowledging possible challenges, she said it \u201cshould be fully compliant with World Trade Organization rules\u201d.\n\nItaly\u2019s Paolo Gentiloni, who is expected to oversee economic affairs in the new Commission, would have a leading role in the policy debate.\n\nHe said last week the design of a border levy must be \u201ccarefully crafted to exert political pressure on climate laggards to take action, to ensure that EU companies can compete on a level playing field\u201d.\n\nHarro van Asselt, professor of climate law and policy at the University of Eastern Finland, said trade disputes could be avoided.\n\n\u201cLimiting the measure to trade-exposed, energy-intensive industries is sensible from an economic, environmental and legal point of view,\u201d he said, adding it was also important for the European Union to consult other countries about the measure\u2019s potential impact.\n\nThe steel industry, represented by industry body Eurofer, said it welcomes the proposed border tax without commenting further.\n\nIndividual companies active in heavy industry in many cases said consideration of how such a complex proposal could be implemented was high on their agendas but it was too soon for public comment.\n\nArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s biggest steelmaker, has said it wants a carbon border tax, but did not respond to questions for this article.\n\nIndustry has not yet said whether it would accept losing other support, in the form of free ETS permits, as demanded by environmental organizations.\n\nThe upstream mining sector, which provides coking coal and iron ore to make steel, has acknowledged it needs to address emissions from the use of its products. It has previously called for a global carbon price but so far has been ambivalent about a carbon border tax.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading miner BHP, when asked about the idea, referred back to comments from CEO Andrew Mackenzie in July in London.\n\n\u201cI am a free trader. Naturally, when you start talking about border taxes, I get a little bit anxious,\u201d Mackenzie said.\n\nThe green lobby, meanwhile, worries that riling China \u2014 which, unlike the United States, remains engaged in the ongoing U.N. effort to reduce global emissions \u2014 could be counter-productive.\n\n\u201cYou risk setting up a massive climate protectionism mechanism and it would not move decarbonization on,\u201d Sam Van den plas, policy director at Carbon Market Watch said.", "description": "The new European Union executive risks inflaming international tensions over trade and the environment even before it takes office in November by promising a carbon border tax to shelter its industry from the cost of cutting emissions.", "authors": ["Susanna Twidale", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436582964&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911AS"}
