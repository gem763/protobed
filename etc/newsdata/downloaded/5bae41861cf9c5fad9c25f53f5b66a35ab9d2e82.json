Reaching \u201crich\u201d status isn\u2019t easy, it isn\u2019t quick, and it certainly doesn\u2019t come cheap. For those looking to be wealthy, you have to have a lot of time and dedication for reaching that goal.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it necessarily has to be complicated. When I say it isn\u2019t easy, I mean it\u2019s not easy to find, say, the next Amazon (NASDAQ: ) while it\u2019s still trading around $30.\n\nWhat\u2019s better is finding a strategy that has a bit more stability, though you\u2019ll have to wait for the payout. My strategy combines a few methods of making money. The first comes from looking at the market as a whole and seeing what\u2019s doing well.\n\nRight now, that would be the e-commerce industry. Rather than go for the top and buy stocks that already have proven value (again, see Amazon), it might be better to look at other businesses that could benefit from this booming industry. According to Meticulous Research, the global e-commerce market is expected to grow by 11.1% per year between 2018 and 2025, reaching just over $24.3 trillion by 2025!\n\nSo what companies stand to benefit from such a boom? In short: light industrial properties. I know, boring! But as the e-commerce business expands, so too will the need for storage and shipping facilities. The global marketplace will need sites around the world, and right now only a fraction of what\u2019s needed is available. That\u2019s why looking into companies that have such capabilities is a great place to start if you\u2019re looking for strong long-term growth.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll want a stock with dividends. Dividends are important, because they mean the company is strong enough to keep rewarding shareholders, and you can use that cash to reinvest in your portfolio. That will increase you bottom line for the foreseeable future, and help you get to that millionaire marker a lot quicker.\n\nSo what stock would I recommend, that encompasses all these qualities? WPT Industrial REIT (TSX:WIR.U). WPT already has 70 light industrial properties across the U.S. in use by companies such as Amazon. It is also expanding its operation, making acquisitions, and buying up properties all over the place to increase its presence. The company is completely set up to take advantage of the e-commerce industry, and as it blossoms so too should its share price and dividend yield.\n\nThe company is new, and that means there are a lot of investors who really haven\u2019t caught on to WPT\u2019s future worth. Herein lies the risk. A company like WPT doesn\u2019t have a long history to fall back on for proof that it has what it takes going forward. But if you do your own research and are confident in the company\u2019s financials and future outlook, then I would say WPT is a smart way to reach millionaire status. While it might not be the sexiest way you get there, it\u2019s certainly the easiest.\n\nIn fact, if WPT grows at the same rate as e-commerce, that would mean today\u2019s share price of $13.65 could be worth $35 by 2025. That would make an investment of $63,500 (your TFSA contribution room) worth $185,468.41, with dividends reinvested, by 2025. And that\u2019s only the beginning.\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.
