Nissan claim a range of 378km, and charging time to 80% (quick charging \u2013 50kw) takes 40 to 60 minutes, while it\u2019s of seven and a half hours from 0 to 100% with a 7kW wallbox.\n\nI enjoyed how sharp the Leaf handled the twisty Rhodes Drive where I drove it and was impressed by how good it powered out of corners with a dollop of torque accessible instantly.\n\nInside, the Leaf has a 17cm, full-colour (TFT) display highlights key features, including information from the audio and navigation systems.\n\nA longer stint in the Leaf is definitely needed to get a better impression, but I was impressed. All we need now is for the government to invest in more charging stations and reduce the tax on electric vehicles imported by foreign automakers.", "description": "As part of the EV mobility tour, Nissan South Africa had a couple of \u2018leaves\u2019 for motoring media to take for a brief drive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9460/fbc1bc96d5cd4bffb70ca2d0b4266d3b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
