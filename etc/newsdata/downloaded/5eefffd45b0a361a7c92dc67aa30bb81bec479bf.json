The two allegedly donated to Sessions amid efforts to remove Yovanovitch, but Sessions has denied that he took any official action as a result of meetings that he had with the two Florida businessmen.\n\nSessions in a statement this month said it was only after \"several congressional colleagues reported to me that the current U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was disparaging President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE to others\" that he wrote a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump hotel cancels Christian aid group's event to support the Kurds: report Pence on Syria: 'Our troops are coming home' House calls on Russia to release Paul Whelan or else provide evidence of wrongdoing MORE raising concerns about the diplomat.\n\n\u201cMy entire motivation for sending the letter was that I believe that political appointees should not be disparaging the President, especially while serving overseas,\" he said at the time.\n\n\"I have been friends with Rudy Giuliani for more than 30 years,\u201d he said, adding that he does not \"know what his business or legal activities in Ukraine have been.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for SDNY did not return a request for comment.\n\nSessions is said to also be under subpoena to provide documents and other information to federal investigators, according to reports, as they seek to examine whether there was a scheme to funnel foreign money to U.S. politicians.\n\nThe subpoena also reportedly is seeking information about Giuliani and his two business associates, who had been helping Giuliani investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenSupport for impeachment inches up in poll Overnight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Democrats say they have game changer on impeachment MORE before their arrest.\n\nHouse Democrats are also examining the circumstances surrounding the Trump administration's contacts with Ukraine, particularly whether Trump and Giuliani withheld nearly $400 million in financial aid to Ukraine as leverage to get a commitment from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, one of his top 2020 political rivals, as well as interference in the 2016 election.\n\nMultiple witnesses have testified behind closed doors in recent weeks, voicing disappointment and frustration about Yovanovitch's sudden removal.\n\nYovanovitch earlier this month also delivered damning testimony in a nearly 10-hour closed-door meeting before House investigators, accusing top Trump officials of staging \"a concerted campaign\u201d against her based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me,\u201d she said, according to her prepared remarks. \u201cBut individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "Federal prosecutors have\u00a0subpoenaed a longtime aide to former Rep.
