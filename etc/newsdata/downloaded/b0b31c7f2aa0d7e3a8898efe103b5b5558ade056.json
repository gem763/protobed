In the US the figure is estimated to be as high as 65 items a year, compared with between 40 and 50 in the 1990s and almost 70 in 2005.\n\n\"Put simply, consumers would rather spend their marginal dollar on, say, going out for a meal, than on buying a 60th item of clothing in a year,\" Morgan Stanley said.\n\nWhile the report refers to large global companies including H &M, Zara parent Inditex Group, GAP, Abercrombie & Fitch and online retailers ASOS and Zalando, it augers poorly for the long-term outlook of the Australian sector, led by Premier Investments, Myer, David Jones, Noni B and discount department stores Kmart, Target and Big W.\n\nEarnings forecasts for the world's largest clothing retailers \u2013 led by ASOS, Zalando, Macys and Marks & Spencer \u2013 have been downgraded by almost 40 per cent since the beginning of 2016, yet their share price performance suggests they are poised for profitable growth.\n\n\"If clothing volumes are plateauing in developed countries, the only way the\n\napparel markets there can grow is if clothing prices go up,\" the report said.\n\n\"But (potential US tariff impacts aside) we think it more likely that they will continue to fall ... as production continues to shift from China to lower-cost countries in the region (such as Vietnam and Bangladesh),\" it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS clothing prices have fallen by 0.8 per cent a year since 2001, while UK prices fell for 13 consecutive years until 2010.\n\nBut volumes in the UK have more than doubled since 1998 and US volumes have grown almost 50 per cent since 2001, driving 28 per cent market growth.\n\n\"Expecting consumers to buy clothing in ever-larger volumes, in response to ever-lower prices, was never likely to be sustained in the very long term,\" Morgan Stanley said.\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\nConsumers might become even more reluctant to buy new clothes if they understand the true impact of their fashion addiction on the environment.\n\nWhile 98 per cent of UK consumers claim to 'recycle' clothes by donating them to charities, putting them in recycling bins or passing them onto friends and family, a recent UK inquiry into fast fashion heard that less than 1 per cent of clothing globally is recycled into new clothes and only 13 per cent is recycled at all. The vast majority (73 per cent) of clothing ends in landfill or is incinerated.\n\nRetailers such as H &M are offering customers vouchers if they return clothing for recycling and launching new collections using sustainable materials.\n\nIn Australia, consumers are being encouraged to donate past purchases to charities every time they buy new clothing to help reduce the 311,040 tonnes of clothing waste generated each year.\n\nMoving the Needle, a program aimed at reducing the amount of clothing sent to landfill, was launched this week by the Minister for the Environment, Sussan Ley, Salvos Stores, St Vincent de Paul, Australian Red Cross and the National Association of Charitable Recycling Organisations.\n\nThe average Australian buys 27 kilos of new textiles a year and accounts for 23 kilos of textile waste that goes to landfill. Move the Needle is targeting a 20 per cent reduction in textile waste by 2022.", "description": "Clothing volumes are starting to peak, while prices are likely to keep falling.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a99dcd13b707727fbb47d1925a0ee82642344af3", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
