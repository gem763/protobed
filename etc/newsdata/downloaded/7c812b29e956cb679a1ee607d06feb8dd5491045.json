(Picture: @courteneycoxofficial/Instagram)\n\nWe hope she washed her hands.\n\nIsla then entered the frame looking like a 1970\u2019s sheriff with her aviators and filter-assisted moustache.\n\nShe smirks at Courteney before telling her to be \u2018Lovely\u2019.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, we didn\u2019t get the joke and neither did a lot of their celebrity friends.\n\nActress and comedienne Whitney Cummings commented: \u2018I have questions\u2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Burn Notice\u2019s Garret Dillahunt wrote: \u2018I feel strange\u2019.\n\nAt least Queer Eye\u2019s Tan France understood the joke as he commented: \u2018LITERALLY SNORT LAUGHED\u2019.\n\nWe still don\u2019t get it.\n\nIn a less strange series of events, Courteney recently gave us the Friends nostalgia gift we have all been waiting for.\n\nAfter spending the show\u2019s 25th anniversary celebrations having a dinner party with Lisa Kudrow (who played Phoebe) as well as Charlie Puth and Judd Apatow, Courteney became the host for two more friends \u2013 Jennifer Aniston (Rachel) and Matt LeBlanc (Joey).\n\nUnderneath, she wrote: \u2018A rare night and I love it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooks like she is the real-life Monica of the group, keeping in touch with all of her former co-stars and throwing parties (that we\u2019re totally jealous we\u2019re not invited to).\n\nOur hearts are full and now we can\u2019t wait for a full reunion.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
