She says she gets laughed at for acting \u2018too white\u2019, but she thinks your identity isn\u2019t about how other people see you.\n\n\u2018My mum was born in Liverpool and my Dad is from Leeds. My mum\u2019s parents are from Cork in southern Ireland, and my Dad\u2019s parents are from Kingston in Jamaica,\u2019 Tiegan tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018Both sets of my grandparents came over to England for the same reason \u2013 a better quality of life. It just so happens that they came from different parts of the world.\u2019\n\nTiegan says she looks like both her parents. She says she has an uncanny resemblance to her mum, but that\u2019s often difficult for people to accept.\n\n\u2018I have colour in my skin like my Dad, and the freckles of my Irish mum,\u2019 she explains. \u2018I have most of my mum\u2019s features. Those who know me, constantly tell how much I look my mum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have the same curly hair (but mine is black and hers is ginger), we have the same smile, nose and shape of face. We look very alike.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m letting my black side down. But I can\u2019t change who I am\u2019 (Picture: Jerry Syder for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018So, it never fails to surprise me how when people look at us, often they are shocked we are related.\n\n\u2018I remember being eight years old, and on a holiday in Jamaica. Whilst in the airport on the trip home, mum and I were separated by the security guards. I was taken into a room and repeatedly asked (nicely) who I was travelling with.\n\n\u2018I replied, \u201cMy mum,\u201d obviously. But, the security guards struggled to believe me, and I have vivid memories of them encouraging me to be honest with them.\u2019\n\nTiegan says that at the time she was completely oblivious to what was happening, and the severity of it. But the discomfort she could sense in her mum is still fresh in her mind.\n\n\u2018It was an intense, uncomfortable situation for her,\u2019 recalls Tiegan.\n\n\u2018How crazy and unbelievable that in this day and age, a white woman cannot be believed to have a mixed-race child. It frustrates, angers and confuses me.\u2019\n\nTiegan was raised by her mum in a white, suburban area in Lancashire.\n\n\u2018I went to church on Sundays with my mum and grandparents. I went to a very academic school, it was a very safe neighbourhood,\u2019 says Tiegan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says that she feels her upbringing is world\u2019s away from the images of black culture we repeatedly see in the media \u2013 which is more often urban and working class. But Tiegan doesn\u2019t think that there\u2019s one \u201cright\u201d way to be black.\n\n\u2018I have colour in my skin like my Dad, and the freckles of my Irish mum\u2019 (Picture: Tiegan Byrne)\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know a single thing about black music, I have never tried any traditional Caribbean food. The most I know about black history is what I learnt in school,\u2019 says Tiegan. \u2018Do I identify with it? Yes. Because I know it must have affected members of my family, but have I seen it or witnessed it? No.\n\n\u2018This is something that I only thought of as strange when I turned eighteen and moved to London. Suddenly, it was thought of as abnormal that I didn\u2019t know \u201cmy\u201d culture, \u201cmy\u201d music, \u201cblack food\u201d.\n\n\u2018But surely, my culture is my mum\u2019s culture. But I was consistently told that I needed to learn about my black roots.\u2019\n\nWhen Tiegan moved to London she made a more diverse group of friends for the first time in her life, but she says that they didn\u2019t always make her feel entirely welcome.\n\n\u2018I will admit I constantly felt like the butt of the joke. I didn\u2019t understand \u201cblack girl problems,\u201d\u2018 she explains.\n\n\u2018Those who know me, constantly tell how much I look my mum\u2019 (Picture: Tiegan Byrne)\n\n\u2018The issues of having a weave, or how to gel your hair, for example. Or the difference between the taste of jerk chicken and curry goat. I had never heard of Bammy. I had never listened to Bob Marley. And I still, to this day, do not understand what a weave is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have so many questions for black and mixed-race people, but never felt like I could ask them because I would be alienating myself even more.\u2019\n\nTiegan understands that there is a knowledge-gap there, and it makes sense. She had a very different upbringing to a lot of her new friends and hugely different cultural experiences.\n\nBut what she doesn\u2019t like is the fact that she is ridiculed for being different to them, or the occasional implications that she is \u2018too white\u2019.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a joke within a group of my friends that there are white people who are blacker than me. And I find this very interesting and very bizarre,\u2019 Tiegan tells us.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s kind of a sly dig at my upbringing and my interests. Mostly I find it a really irritating joke because it suggests that there are people better at being me than me.\n\n\u2018How can someone who is not at all black, be blacker than me, when I\u2019m part black? It\u2019s a crazy concept and I know people say it to annoy me.\n\n\u2018Whether you like it or not, I am part black. Nobody can take away that my Dad is black, regardless of the fact that I my interests don\u2019t always fit your stereotypes.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I think \u2013 maybe it\u2019s true, maybe I\u2019m not as black as I should be. So, I laugh along at the joke. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m letting my black side down. But I can\u2019t change who I am.\u2019\n\n\u2018When I look back at pictures of my childhood, or think back to important memories I see a sea of white faces\u2019 (Picture: Tiegan Byrne)\n\n\u2018Another joke my friends have is that I can have my \u201cblack card\u201d taken away depending on what I do. It may be do a stupid dance, or flirting with the wrong person, sometimes something as stupid as ordering a Prosecco. Something very me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So they take away my \u201cblack card\u201d. Because I no longer deserve to be black, because what I did was \u201cunblack\u201d.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, do black people not like Prosecco or doing stupid dances? And where is this handbook I apparently need to read? It constantly frustrates and upsets me, because, once again, I\u2019m the butt of the joke. And it\u2019s ridiculous to think that you have to act a certain way to be black.\u2019\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been entirely plain sailing with her white friends either.\n\nLooking back, Tiegan can identify some problematic and othering remarks from the people closest to her growing up and, although she doesn\u2019t believe the intention was ever malicious, the effect it had on her was very real.\n\n\u2018I realise that when I look back at pictures of my childhood, or think back to important memories I see a sea of white faces,\u2019 says Tiegan.\n\n\u2018I am always the only non-white person in that picture, or in my immediate family, or in my group of friends.\n\n\u2018I sometimes feel like those pictures and friendships would be so much more aesthetically pleasing without me there, the family would fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. But I am there, and that will never change.\n\n\u2018And no one wants it to change, I know that. At this point, I am so used to being the only ethnic person in a white room.\n\n\u2018In fact, I have never lived in a house with another person of colour, I have never kissed or dated a person of colour. I am constantly surrounded by white people and usually, I don\u2019t think twice about it.\n\nTiegan with her dad and younger half-sisters (Picture: Tiegan Byrne)\n\n\u2018Growing up, my white friends would ask to touch my hair, or they would say; \u201cWow, you\u2019re so brown.\u201d I didn\u2019t see it as racism at the time, but these comments have separated me from feeling like I\u2019m part of the group.\u2019\n\nTiegan says that dating white guys has thrown up its fair share of problems too. She says she is frequently approached by men who tell her that mixed-race girls are their \u2018type\u2019. What a chat-up line.\n\n\u2018Once, a boy I was dating said: \u201cYou have the body of a black girl, but the mind of a white girl.\u201d I ended the relationship immediately \u2013 out of shock, anger and discomfort,\u2019 says Tiegan.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been told I am the perfect balance \u2013 the curves of a black girl, but more personality than a white girl, a bigger bum than a white girl, but not as \u201coverwhelming\u201d as a black girl. Men tell me this and think it\u2019s a compliment, I find it disgusting, insulting and degrading.\u2019\n\nTiegan is a working actress. A tough, unpredictable job for anybody. But she says that being mixed-race puts her at an advantage in some respects due to the current cultural \u2018coolness\u2019 of being racially ambiguous.\n\n\u2018Being mixed has helped, improved and driven my career,\u2019 explains Tiegan. \u2018Being mixed raced is very fashionable at the moment, and it has got me into hundreds of rooms in just over a year since I graduated.\n\n\u2018Which is almost unheard of for my fellow actors I have trained with. I am beyond grateful, excited and enthusiastic about my career.\u2019\n\nBut there are also some specific drawbacks that come with having Tiegan\u2019s look in the world of acting. She often feels forced down a path dictated by narrow assumptions about her abilities and casting potential.\n\n\u2018I have always wanted to learn to do a Newcastle accent, but I was repeatedly told that it was \u201cnot my casting.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been told I am perfect balance \u2013 the curves of a black girl, but more personality than a white girl\u2019 (Picture: Tiegan Byrne)\n\n\u2018They said nobody would expect to see a Geordie mixed-race girl on their TV, and that I should learn a London accent or an African accent instead.\n\n\u2018When I disagreed with other black actors or teachers that I wasn\u2019t interested in Nigerian accents, instead I wanted a Geordie or a Scottish accent \u2013 they were genuinely speechless. They seemed hurt and confused.\n\n\u2018Teachers told me there was no point in me learning northern accents, that I\u2019d never be asked to do it. I am still baffled by that assertion. I am a perfect example of a northern, Liverpudlian, mixed-raced girl \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t I be?\n\n\u2018Acting is completely about stereotypes. The stereotype of a mixed-raced girl, I have found, is either young and pregnant, doing drugs, or very working class.\n\n\u2018I have been asked more times than I can count to be seen for a role as a mixed, cocaine-addicted, young mum. Which is a damaging stereotype.\n\n\u2018But we are so much more than our stereotypes. I am mixed-race, I am intellectual, passionate and an adventurous romantic. But I am very rarely seen for a role of that nature.\u2019\n\nTiegan is proud of who she is, from the ginger tints in her black, curly hair, to the stories of her family members from all over the world. What she wants is for people to stop making assumptions about who she is based on how black or white they perceive her to be.\n\n\u2018I think the world has a long way to go to completely accepting that being mixed-race is more than just having brown skin,\u2019 says Tiegan.\n\n\u2018Being mixed has its own culture and way of being.\n\n\u2018There are no sides, you can\u2019t be blacker or more white depending on your upbringing and your heritage isn\u2019t something that people can take away from you.\u2019\n\nMixed Up Being mixed-race is so much more than just black and white (Pictures: Jerry Syder) Mixed Up is our weekly series that gets to the heart of what it means to be mixed-race in the UK today. Going beyond discussions of divided identity, this series takes a look at the unique joys, privileges and complexities that come with being mixed-race - across of variety of different contexts. The mixed-race population is the UK's fastest-growing ethnic group, and yet there is still so much more to understand about the varied lived experiences of individuals within this hugely heterogenous group.
