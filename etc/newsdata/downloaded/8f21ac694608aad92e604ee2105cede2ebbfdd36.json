By then it was too late - even if we had left immediately we wouldn't have made the match.\"\n\nInstead, Rob and Lee, who did not want to reveal their surnames, watched the Reds beat Genk 4-1 in a bar - where a local radio station Radio 2 Oost-Vlaanderen photographed them commiserating their mistake.\n\nThey revealed they had forked out \u00a3130 each on rail tickets, as well as \u00a360 on match tickets.\n\nRob said they had originally planned to travel to Genk with two other friends, but the person in charge of the travel had dropped out at the last minute, so they had hastily booked travel and accommodation themselves.\n\nHe said: \"Me and Lee have a bit of a track record for this. Last time we tried to watch Liverpool we got on the wrong train - instead of taking the fast train, we ended up on the slow train which took six hours.\n\n\"I think next time we will let someone else book the travel.\"\n\nThey have now been invited back by Genk football team, to watch the Ghent versus Genk match in January as VIPs with a dinner and guided tour of the stadium.\n\nRob said: \"We would love to go.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Two Liverpool fans were left red-faced after travelling to Ghent instead of Genk and therefore missing their side's Champions League match on Wednesday.
