Policy positions often are just a way of signaling where a candidate stands on the political spectrum. But 2020 is shaping up to be different, the most ideas-driven election in recent American history. On the Democratic side, a robust debate about inequality has given rise to ambitious proposals to redress the imbalance in Americans\u2019 economic situations. Candidates are churning out positions on banking regulation, antitrust law and the future effects of artificial intelligence. The Green New Deal is spurring debate on the crucial issue of climate change, which could also play a role in a possible Republican challenge to Donald Trump.\n\nYahoo News will be examining these and other policy questions in \u201cThe Ideas Election\u201d \u2014 a series of articles on how candidates are defining and addressing the most important issues facing the United States as it prepares to enter a new decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile data suggests that one in five adults deals with mental illness, many Americans feel that their insurance providers offer too thin and, in some cases, no coverage to meet their demanding and sometimes debilitating health concerns \u2014 a conundrum that forces patients to pursue pricey out-of-network care. A 2017 study conducted by the consulting firm Milliman found several discrepancies in the way both patients and doctors who work within the realm of mental health were treated; for example, in 2015, patients were four to six times more likely to be provided behavioral care out of network than in network.\n\n\n\n\n\nLack of treatment has a serious impact on consumers\u2019 wallets \u2014 the American Journal of Psychiatry estimated back in 2008 that serious mental illness cost the country $193.2 billion a year in lost earnings. And federal funding wasn\u2019t keeping up the pace, according to Time magazine, which reported that merely 6.2 percent of total U.S. health care funding in 2008 was allocated to mental health treatment. Lawmakers attempted to reconcile the discrepancy in the same year with the bipartisan Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) \u2014 an extension of similar legislation passed in 1996 \u2014 as well as a rider tacked onto the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n\n\u201cEach year the economic cost of untreated mental illness is staggering \u2014 over $100 billion on untreated mental health disorders and $400 billion on addiction disorders,\u201d Rep. John Sullivan, R-Okla., told Time. \u201cOur country cannot afford to continue losing $500 billion a year to these treatable diseases.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama signs the 21st Century Cures Act.

Obama-era policies advanced the ball a bit, with provisions in the Affordable Care Act building on the MHPAEA by applying regulations to individual \u2014 rather than group \u2014 plans, though state governments also play a hand in enforcing or expanding the legislation.\n\nStill, despite provisions, the cost of treating mental disorders can be overwhelming, as access to necessary services shrinks year to year; a special report from USA Today discovered that states had slashed $5 billion in mental health services from 2009 to 2012. To make matters more dire, those who needed in-patient psychiatric care had fewer places to stay, as at least 4,500 public psychiatric hospital beds were eliminated in the same period. As the size of provider networks and resources has continued to shrink, the rate of suicide has ticked up: From 1999 to 2016, the national suicide rate increased more than 25 percent.", "description": "With a national mental health crisis costing about $444 billion a year, presidential candidates have put forth several proposals to combat high premiums and coverage black holes.", "authors": ["Brittany Shepherd", "National Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PmsO2Iml6IYLpL0oNtrLEg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/39cd1b20-cfee-11e9-9cd7-7e2851edd151", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
