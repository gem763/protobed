His impeachment is imperative | Robert Reich", "language": "en", "text": "Amid the impeachment furor, don\u2019t lose sight of the renewed importance of protecting the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nTrump impeachment inquiry sparks 'bedlam' at Fox News Read more\n\nThe difference between Richard Nixon\u2019s abuse of power (trying to get dirt on political opponents to help with his 1972 re-election, and then covering it up) and Donald Trump\u2019s abuse (trying to get Ukraine\u2019s president to get dirt on a political opponent to help with his 2020 reelection, and then covering it up) isn\u2019t just that Nixon\u2019s involved a botched robbery at the Watergate while Trump\u2019s involves a foreign nation.\n\nIt\u2019s that Nixon\u2019s abuse of power was discovered during his second term, after he was re-elected. He was still a dangerous crook, but by that time he had no reason to inflict still more damage on American democracy.\n\nTrump\u2019s abuse has been uncovered 14 months before the 2020 election, at a time when he still has every incentive to do whatever he can to win.\n\nIf special counsel Robert Mueller had found concrete evidence that Trump asked Vladimir Putin for help in digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton in 2016, that would have been the \u201csmoking gun\u201d that could have ended the Trump presidency.\n\nWilliam Barr is working for Trump, just like Rudy Giuliani and all the other lapdogs, toadies and sycophants\n\nNow Trump is revealed to have asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, for dirt on Joe Biden in the 2020 election, who\u2019s to say he isn\u2019t also soliciting Vladimir Putin\u2019s help this time around?\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump told two Russian officials in a 2017 meeting in the Oval Office he was unconcerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the US election because the US did the same in other countries. This prompted White House officials to limit access to Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nTrump is in a better position to make such deals than he was in 2016 because as president he\u2019s got a pile of US military aid and international loans and grants that could make a foreign rulers\u2019 life very comfortable, or, if withheld, exceedingly difficult.\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned, Trump uses whatever leverage he can get, for personal gain. That\u2019s the art of the deal.\n\nWho can we count on to protect our election process in 2020?\n\nCertainly not William Barr. We\u2019ve seen the transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call where he urges Zelenskiy to work with the attorney general to investigate Biden \u2013 even telling Zelenskiy Barr will follow up with his own call.\n\nWe also know Barr\u2019s justice department decided Trump had not acted illegally, and told the acting director of national intelligence to keep the whistleblower complaint from Congress.\n\nThis is the same attorney general, not incidentally, who said Mueller\u2019s report had cleared the Trump campaign of conspiring with Russia when in fact Mueller had found that the campaign welcomed Russia\u2019s help, and who said Mueller had absolved Trump of obstructing justice when Mueller specifically declined to decide the matter.\n\nBarr is not working for the United States. He\u2019s working for Trump, just like Rudy Giuliani and all the other lapdogs, toadies and sycophants.\n\nFortunately, some government appointees still understand their responsibilities. We\u2019re indebted to the anonymous intelligence officer who complained about Trump\u2019s calls to the president of Ukraine, and to Michael Atkinson, inspector general of the intelligence community, who deemed the complaint of \u201curgent concern\u201d.\n\nBut if the 2020 election is going to be \u2013 and to be seen as \u2013 legitimate, the nation will need many more whistleblowers and officials with integrity.\n\nAll of us will need to be vigilant.\n\nWilliam Barr: attorney general plays Republican spear-catcher again Read more\n\nOver the last two and a half years, Trump has shown himself willing to trample any aspect of our democracy that gets in his way \u2013 attacking the media, using the presidency for personal profit, packing the federal courts, verbally attacking judges, blasting the head of the Federal Reserve, spending money in ways Congress did not authorize, and subverting the separation of powers.\n\nHe believes he\u2019s invincible. He\u2019s now daring our entire constitutional and political system to stop him.\n\nThe real value of the formal impeachment now under way is to put Trump on notice that he can\u2019t necessarily get away with abusing his presidential power to win re-election. He will still try, of course. But at least a line has been drawn. And now everyone is watching.\n\nRegardless of how the impeachment turns out, Trump\u2019s predation can be constrained as long as his presidency can be ended with the 2020 election. If that election is distorted, and if this man is re-elected, all bets are off.", "description": "Watergate brought down a second-term president.
