It represents the latest effort by Trump\u2019s administration to crack down on immigration, a signature issue during his presidency and 2020 re-election bid.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and others who challenged the administration\u2019s policy in federal court said it violates U.S. immigration law and accused the administration of failing to follow the correct legal process in issuing the rule, which was unveiled on July 15.\n\nRelated Coverage El Salvador sends hundreds of police to border to thwart migrants\n\nIn her dissent, Sotomayor said that the government\u2019s rule may be in significant tension with the asylum statute.\n\n\u201cIt is especially concerning, moreover, that the rule the government promulgated topples decades of settled asylum practices and affects some of the most vulnerable people in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 without affording the public a chance to weigh in.\u201d\n\nEight days after the rule went into effect in July, California-based U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar issued a nationwide injunction blocking it.\n\nThen began a back-and-forth between Tigar and the 9th Circuit, which scaled back the injunction so that the Trump rule was blocked in the border states of California and Arizona while in effect in Texas and New Mexico.\n\nTigar ruled to restore the nationwide ban on Monday, but the 9th Circuit scaled it back again on Tuesday night.\n\nThey were both trumped by Supreme Court, which will allow the asylum restriction to remain in place until the underlying legality of the rule is determined at trial.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A plaque commemorating U.S. President Donald Trump hangs on the U.S.-Mexico border fence as Trump visits the U.S.-Mexico border in Calexico, California, U.S., April 5, 2019.

The rule would keep asylum protections for Mexican citizens.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said the Trump administration was \u201cpleased\u201d by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which he said rejected an \u201cerroneous\u201d ruling by the lower court judge.\n\nBut Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 Judiciary Committee, and Zoe Lofgren, the head of the judiciary panel\u2019s immigration subcommittee, called the court\u2019s decision disappointing.\n\n\u201cLives will be lost. This rule will result in those fleeing fear and persecution to be turned away at our doorstep and will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the region,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nGOVERNMENT ARGUED RIGHT TO SET POLICY\n\nThe rule drew legal challenges including from a coalition of groups represented by the ACLU who accused the administration of pursuing an \u201casylum ban\u201d and jeopardizing the safety of migrants fleeing persecution.\n\nIn the administration\u2019s request to fully enforce the rule, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco asked the Supreme Court to issue a stay blocking the injunction while litigation over the issue proceeds because the judge\u2019s order interferes with the government\u2019s authority to establish immigration policy.\n\nThe administration said the rule screens out asylum claims that are unlikely to succeed and \u201cdeters aliens without a genuine need for asylum from making the arduous and potentially dangerous journey from Central America to the United States.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday granted a request by President Donald Trump's administration to fully enforce a new rule that would curtail asylum applications by immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, a key element of his hardline immigration policies.", "authors": ["Lawrence Hurley", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428852984&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1XU", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
