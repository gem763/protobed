They cite articles with headlines such as \"The Smartest People in the World Are All Men\" and \"Data: Young Muslims Are a Ticking Time Bomb in the West.\"\n\nA number of advertisers have fled the site recently.\n\nBreitbart spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore issued a statement to the Times saying the company is \"one of the most pro-police, pro-law-enforcement news organizations in America.\"\n\nHours after the police chief raised concerns about the job listing that says \"Choose your future! LAPD is hiring!\" the city's personnel department issued a statement saying the recruitment ad had wound up on \"sites that do not reflect the city's values.\"\n\nCity of Los Angeles personnel department spokesman Bruce Whidden told the Times that his agency buys job ads through Google on behalf of the LAPD and other city departments. The department is now reexamining its ad filters, he said.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
