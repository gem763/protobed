Anything going on that might be upsetting or any reason that you know of that she might go missing at all?'\n\nLacomba replied: 'Like I said like, I, I, nothing, well obviously I, I, I find out about like her sort of seeing quite a few blokes sort of thing, erm...'\n\nHe then spoke of how Sarah had been slapped and scratched by a work colleague, and then pinned to a wall the same colleague's boyfriend.\n\nLacomba said this incident had occurred just four days before he had gone missing and been reported to police.\n\nThe court also heard of the fruitless attempts made by Mr James and several members of Sarah's family, including her mother Ann Reid and her 22-year-old son to contact her throughout October 10.\n\nHer phone was going to voicemail and there was no activity on WhatsApp or her Facebook account.\n\nAt one stage Mr James sent a message to his girlfriend asking 'Are you alive?'.\n\nHe and her son also contacted Lacomba in their desperate bid to track Sarah down and said they would be contacting police to search for her.\n\nProsecutors say the movements of a taxi they believe is Lacomba's after Ms Wellgreen went missing show he was her killer, despite her body having never been found\n\nLacomba denies murder, claiming he went to bed on October 9 and woke to find Sarah missing at 7am the next day.\n\nHowever, the prosecution allege he murdered her and then disposed of her body 'in a calculated manner, designed to avoid detection'.\n\nIt is said he was motivated by the potential loss of the home they shared and having only limited access to their children as a result.\n\nAt the time she disappeared Sarah had landed a new job with a better salary and was in the process of buying him out of the property.\n\nEarlier the court heard how, having gone to bed shortly after returning home at 8pm on October 9, she sent numerous messages to Mr James and two other male friends, Anthony Garnham and Joe Eleini.\n\nIn one message to Mr James she spoke of how 'a huge weight' had been lifted from her after securing her new job.\n\nThe footage filmed at several houses and farm buildings near the beautician's home in Kent\n\nReferring to Lacomba, she told Mr James: 'The fat t**t [Lacomba] said ''Oh that means you won't get benefits for the kids' so he asked to claim them. WTF.'\n\nAsked by Mr James why she went to bed so early she replied: 'I don't like to sit downstairs with Ben so I go to bed.'\n\nIn the same conversation she added: 'I told him that I know he claims working tax credits and they have given him a lump sum. He's been very quiet since I got back...the truth hurts.'\n\nIn a further message to Mr Eleini they arranged to meet the following Tuesday for a 'play date'.\n\nShe then added in one of her very final messages sent at about 10pm: 'There is always something to look forward to you just need to open your eyes a bit more and dream X'.\n\nLacomba told police investigating Miss Wellgreen's disappearance that she switched off the CCTV at their home on the night she vanished so he 'wouldn't know who she was going out with or where'.\n\nHe also claimed that when his former partner moved back into the house with him in May last year, she wanted them to 'get back together'. He said he knew she would 'absolutely not' have left her children.\n\nPolice during the search for Ms Wellgreen. She has never been found and prosecutors say she was murdered\n\nPC Rachel Manley, the first officer to visit Lacomba after he reported Miss Wellgreen missing, said he was 'calm and relaxed' when she spoke to him at his home.\n\nHowever he also 'repeatedly' tried to show her messages on his ex-partner's phone.\n\nThe police officer said he was 'persistently' trying to show her texts that Miss Wellgreen had been sending other men, adding: 'He said on numerous occasions that he believed she was messaging other men.'\n\nThe officer left the property about 90 minutes later and told Lacomba other officers might carry out a more detailed search, but found it 'strange' that he spoke of 'going back to work'.\n\nShe explained: We had established Sarah didn't have keys and didn't have any way of contacting him or getting back inside if she returned. But he was adamant he was going back to work.'\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Ben Lacomba contacted Kent Police more than 24 hours after the 46-year-old beautician had disappeared from the home they shared in New Ash Green, Kent, in October last year.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19398014-0-image-a-102_1570456079287.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
