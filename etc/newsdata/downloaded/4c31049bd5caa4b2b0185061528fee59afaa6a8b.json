Now home to thousands of people who have fled conflict and poverty in their own countries, Bosnia is heading for a humanitarian catastrophe that no one is talking about.\n\nWalking into the Vu\u010djak migrant camp, which lies on Bosnia\u2019s north-west border with Croatia, it\u2019s hard to know what to feel most shocked about. The diarrhoea covering the floor outside the tents? The signs warning of landmines just a few feet away? The hundreds of people sleeping on filthy mud \u2013 six people huddling under one blanket?\n\nThe migrants living here call it a jungle and it is. Everyone spoke about the Calais Jungle, but Bosnia\u2019s Jungle is unheard of, perhaps because it\u2019s that little bit further from our own doorstep. But the crisis here is real, I have seen it and it\u2019s only getting worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalking through the camp I hear the same sentence repeatedly, \u2018this is no place for animals, let alone humans\u2019.\n\nThe sense of desperation is overwhelming \u2013 people are literally begging for help, most without proper shoes or warm coats and the majority barely surviving on just one small meal a day. One young man told me that he thought nothing could be as bad as his life in Afghanistan, but then he came to Vu\u010djak.\n\nThere are no toilets, no running water, no electricity, no medical services, and as winter approaches bears and wolves are making their way down from the surrounding mountains into the valley where the camp has been steadily growing for the past four months.\n\nNo one wants to live here, but official UN camps in the area are full.\n\nVu\u010djak migrant camp lies on Bosnia\u2019s north-west border with Croatia (Picture:Freya Carr)\n\nIn the past few days Vu\u010djak has seen a massive influx of people, growing from housing about 700 people to 2,000 people in just 48 hours. But the size of the camp itself has not grown \u2013 stretching its borders risks moving even closer to landmines. The \u2018dining room\u2019 has been dismantled to accommodate more sleeping bodies on the floor, but many are being forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures.\n\nThe Red Cross, driven purely by its humanitarian mandate to help the most vulnerable people, is the only organisation currently providing any assistance in Vu\u010djak. Other organisations have refused to enter because the conditions are so inhumane and inappropriate for any human to exist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the camp was established in June, our local volunteers have been providing two meals a day to its residents. But the sudden influx of people has diminished supplies and forced us to cut back our support to just one meal a day. Migrants are halving their meals to share with the new arrivals \u2013 a sight that is both heart-breaking and uplifting all at once.\n\nNot only is this camp pushing the thousands of people living here to breaking point, but it is exhausting the volunteers working here and presenting them with one of the most challenging decisions they have ever faced.\n\nDo they push themselves to breaking point and continue to work as the only actor in such a challenging environment, or do they pull out of the camp and hope it forces authorities to find a better alternative?\n\nThis is the agonising decision our teams are trying to make right now.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know what the future holds for people in Vu\u010djak, what we do know is that they will not survive there much longer. Winter is coming and a safe alternative to Vu\u010djak must be found to save lives and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nTo support the British Red Cross to help more refugees and migrants across Bosnia and Herzegovina, donate to the charity\u2019s Global Refugee Fund.\n\nMORE: Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has genocide sentence extended to life\n\nMORE: International athlete drowns trying to get to Europe on refugee boat\n\nMORE: Child dead in fire at Greek refugee camp as rioting breaks out", "description": "One young man told me that he thought nothing could be as bad as his life in Afghanistan, but then he came to Vu\u010djak.", "authors": ["Freya Carr"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JBR-Vucjak-BRC-03102019-43-4608_1572007013.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
