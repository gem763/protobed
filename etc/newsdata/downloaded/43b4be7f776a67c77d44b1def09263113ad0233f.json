She told MMA Junkie on Wednesday that it\u2019s as automatic as waking up in the morning.\n\n\u201cAre you confident that you\u2019re going to wake up tomorrow?\u201d Jedrzejczyk said at the UFC Tampa open workouts. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d\n\nIf there was a tone of annoyance in the former champion\u2019s voice, it\u2019s because the topic of how her weight cut is going swallowed all other news related to the card after reports surfaced Wednesday which claimed she wasn\u2019t going to be able to hit 116 pounds by Friday.\n\nWaterson\u2019s apparently rebuffed attempts to change the terms of the fight, and Waterson (17-6 MMA, 5-2 UFC) herself believes she may have caught Jedrzejczyk, a former flyweight, trying to get a subtle edge on Waterson, a former atomweight.\n\nBut Jedrzejczyk (15-3 MMA, 9-3 UFC) says there\u2019s nothing to reports that she\u2019s not going to make weight, and reminded everyone she has plenty of time to prove herself right.\n\n\u201cDid I miss something? Did I miss today? Did I miss tomorrow? No, Friday (is the weigh-in),\u201d she said. \u201cSo please, give me the time and space to make weight, too easy to make weight and fight Michelle Waterson on Saturday.\u201d\n\nThe South Floria resident by way of Poland, who challenged Valentina Shevchenko for the flyweight belt last time out in a unanimous-decision loss at UFC 231, said that fighters\u2019 bodies can react differently every time they cut weight.\n\n\u201cI was super light a month ago, then my weight went a little bit up and down again,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cBut then the fight before Valentina Shevchenko, I was super light, Every weight cut, your body show up different. Our bodies are clever beasts every like I said, every weight cut every time is totally different, different thing.\u201d\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve never been through the process, well, Jedrzejczyk, who has never missed weight once in her 18-fight career, says to keep your yap shut and just wait and see her make weight.\n\n\u201cThere are always some troubles with the weight cut even come, there\u2019s always some risk, we\u2019re definitely, the fighter, your body just shut down, make the weight,\u201d the former champion said. \u201cI know people are smart and think it\u2019s that easy to, \u2018hey, go run for 10 hours or don\u2019t eat,\u2019 but it\u2019s not like this, you know? So people who are not important who don\u2019t know a lot about it should just stay quiet and just weight until the end, the results.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nYou can see Jedrzejczyk\u2019s open workout in the video above, and watch her full media scrum below.", "description": "The former strawweight champion said everything will be great when she makes weight for her fight.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/joanna-jedrzejczyk-ufc-231-ceremonial-weigh-ins1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
