The ban went into effect on Tuesday.\n\nGun rights groups had filed separate appeals to Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, requesting a temporary hold on the ban. Roberts denied one appeal earlier this week; Sotomayor referred hers to the full court, which denied it on Thursday, allowing the ban to proceed while challenges to it move through the courts.\n\nBump stocks gained national attention after they were used in the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, where a gunman used bump-stock outfitted rifles to kill 58 people at an outdoor concert.\n\nThe ban requires bump stocks to be destroyed \u2014 such as by melting, shredding or crushing \u2014 or handed over at an office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. The ATF recommends making an appointment with the ATF office beforehand.\n\nAs NPR's Bill Chappell reported on Wednesday, the anticipation of a ban spurred sales of the devices:\n\nRW Arms, a prominent bump stock retailer based in Fort Worth, Texas, says its entire remaining inventory of 60,000 bump stocks has now been turned over to the ATF's custody. The items will be \"shredded and recycled under the supervision of ATF agents,\" the company said. In the run-up to the total ban, RW Arms had rushed to sell as many bump stocks as it could, posting a countdown clock on its website to warn customers of the impending change. Its bump stocks were priced at between $179 and $199; the website now says they're out of stock. The ATF isn't saying exactly how many bump stocks have been turned in so far \u2014 in large part because there are many ways for gun owners to comply with the law. But the agency's chief of public affairs, April Langwell, says bump stock owners have turned the accessories in at ATF field offices \"all across the country.\"\n\nSome states and cities banned the devices more than a year ago.", "description": "Gun rights groups had a sought a hold on the ban, which went into effect on Tuesday.
