Nigeria's film industry draws global entertainment brands\n\n* \"Nollywood\" is world's second-largest film industry\n\n* Investors seek access to industry's content, audience\n\n* African states offer \"rare\" pay-TV growth opportunity\n\nBy Alexis Akwagyiram\n\nLAGOS, Sept 10 (Reuters) - \"Oya!\" shouts the director in\n\nNigerian Pidgin English. Actors take their marks. Lighting\n\nblinks on. The film crew snaps into action after the order to\n\nhurry up.\n\nIt's another day in Nollywood, the affectionate nickname for\n\nNigeria's film industry - the world's second most prolific after\n\nIndia's Bollywood, producing hundreds of films and TV episodes\n\neach month.\n\nFor decades it was a factory churning out visual pulp\n\nfiction destined for the market stalls of DVD pirates. But\n\nNollywood is increasingly grabbing the attention - and financing\n\n- of global entertainment brands.\n\nSome, like French group Vivendi's Canal+, seek to\n\nharness Nigerian hustle and know-how to extend the lifespan of\n\nthe traditional pay-TV model, which is bleeding customers in\n\ndeveloped markets but still has a future in Africa.\n\nOthers, including South Africa's MultiChoice , are\n\nusing Nigeria as a testing ground for introducing streaming\n\nplatforms in African markets with poor communications\n\ninfrastructure and low income levels.\n\nIn both cases, it's local production that's benefiting.\n\n\"Ten years ago Nollywood was very different,\" Mary Njoku,\n\nwhose ROK studios was acquired by Canal+ in July, told Reuters\n\nas the film crew worked in an abandoned hotel in Nigeria's\n\nmegacity Lagos. \"Today we shoot with better cameras... We do\n\nthings differently.\"\n\nA room on the hotel's top floor was standing in for a\n\ncollege dorm on \"What Are Friends For?\", an ROK comedy series\n\nthat will be among new shows aired by Canal+ in coming months.\n\nThe company first dipped its toe into Africa's most populous\n\ncountry six years ago, buying up local films, dubbing them and\n\nairing them on a dedicated channel, Nollywood TV, to viewers in\n\nFrench-speaking Africa.\n\nThat success led to the creation of a second channel.\n\nThe deal with ROK secures a steady supply of new films and\n\nseries as the firm eyes a further expansion of African content,\n\nsaid Fabrice Faux, Canal+ International's chief content officer.\n\nSince it was founded six years ago, ROK has produced more\n\nthan 540 films and 25 series. Under the Canal+ deal, Njoku says\n\nit aims to increase production from next year to around 300\n\nfilms and 20 series annually.\n\nCanal+'s pivot to Africa - a golden opportunity for ROK - is\n\na business necessity for the French company.\n\n\"It is one of the very rare pay-TV markets that is growing\n\nand is growing very fast,\" Faux told Reuters. \"When I joined\n\nCanal+ International back in 2014, we had half a million\n\n(African subscribers) and now we have 4 million.\"\n\nCompare that to mainland France where, as of last year, it\n\nhad lost some 1.3 million individual subscribers since\n\n2013. Much of that decline arose from losing broadcasting rights\n\nto popular sporting events. But it also reflected stiff\n\ncompetition from streaming services such as Netflix and\n\nAmazon . However, Faux believes such rivals pose no\n\nthreat in Africa due to a widespread lack of 4G coverage or\n\nfixed broadband internet on the continent.\n\nTo properly develop African markets, however, Canal+ must\n\ncater to their diverse audiences, Faux said.\n\nFrancophone Africa has no Nollywood equivalent. Producing\n\nshows there has been slow and expensive, as Canal+ has been\n\nforced to bring in film crews from Europe to shoot on location,\n\nFaux said. He now hopes Canal+ can use ROK to clone the\n\nNollywood model.\n\n\"The best knowledge and expertise is there in Nigeria. So it\n\nis our intention to try to bring some producers, technicians,\n\ndirectors to French-speaking Africa, for us to try to develop\n\nnew production methods,\" Faux said.\n\nTEMPORARY GLITCHES?\n\nIf Canal+ sees little threat from streaming services in\n\nAfrica, MultiChoice - the first major entertainment group to\n\nrealise Nollywood's potential - is out to prove it wrong.\n\nIn its infancy in the 1990s, Nollywood churned out cheap\n\nfilms ranging from bawdy comedies to morality tales about\n\nwitchcraft and infidelity.\n\nLow on production quality but high on entertainment value,\n\nthese movies quickly garnered a fanatical following across\n\nAfrica and its diaspora. And in 2003, MultiChoice launched\n\nAfrica Magic - a Nollywood channel that would grow into a\n\nsubscription package on its DStv satellite network.\n\nIn July, Showmax, MultiChoice's fledgling video-streaming\n\nservice, launched in Nigeria.\n\n\"The Nollywood phenomenon makes it quite interesting from a\n\ncontent development point of view. You have a huge base of very\n\nloyal fans,\" said Niclas Ekdahl, CEO of MultiChoice's connected\n\nvideo division.\n\nShowmax - also available in South Africa and Kenya - is not\n\nalone in Nigeria's video-on-demand market.\n\nU.S. streaming giant Netflix released \"Lionheart\", its first\n\noriginal film produced in Nigeria, in January. It is also\n\nnegotiating licence deals for Nigerian films such as \"Chief\n\nDaddy\", a comedy that debuted on the platform in March.\n\nBut bringing streaming to African audiences won't be easy.\n\nExpensive mobile data and low incomes make regular streaming\n\nunaffordable for many on the continent.\n\nOne gigabyte of data, enough to watch about three films,\n\ncosts the equivalent of around $2.80 in Nigeria, while most\n\npeople live on less than $2 a day.\n\nThe experience of Malaysian streaming platform iflix is a\n\ncautionary tale.\n\nIt launched in Nigeria in 2017, then expanded to Kenya,\n\nGhana and Zimbabwe following a tie-up with Kwese TV, a\n\nsubsidiary of Zimbabwe's Econet Media Limited.\n\nHowever, data discounts and a pay-as-you-go option were not\n\nenough to sustain the business. In December, iflix sold its\n\nAfrica business to the Econet group, which shut down the\n\nstreaming service last month.\n\nShowmax's Ekdahl remains undaunted, passing the challenges\n\noff as \"temporary glitches\". The potential payoff - a largely\n\nuntapped audience of 1 billion - is worth the effort of\n\ntailoring a business to African markets, he believes.\n\nShowmax partnered with mobile phone operators Vodacom\n\n, MTN and Telkom in South Africa and\n\nSafaricom in Kenya to offer reduced data and\n\nsubscription fees. It aims to do the same in Nigeria.\n\nIt is also experimenting with installing wireless internet\n\nin public transport, so viewers can download content during\n\ntheir daily commutes without incurring data costs.\n\nThe boom in interest in Nigeria's film industry can only be\n\na good thing, says Joshua Richard, a barrel-chested actor who\n\nplays a fanatically religious student on \"What Are Friends For?\"\n\nForeign investment will, he hopes, help Nollywood shake off\n\na reputation for shoddy camerawork and muffled sound, while also\n\nleading to greater artistic recognition overseas.\n\n\"It exposes African actors to a bigger audience,\" he said.\n\n\"We have lots of good content in Nollywood, but it doesn't get\n\nthe credit it deserves.\"", "description": "Action!
