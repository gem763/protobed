Source: 48 Hours\n\nParents of a cheerleader who buried her newborn baby in the family\u2019s garden after giving birth in the bathroom have spoken out for the first time since she was acquitted of murder.\n\nKim and Scott Richardson, parents of Brooke Skylar Richardson, told US program 48 hours they had no idea their daughter had been pregnant and then secretly disposed of the body.\n\nRichardson was last week convicted of gross abuse of a corpse but was given a three year probationary sentence following her trial in Lebanon, Ohio.\n\n\u2018We missed everything\u2019\n\nThe parents presented photos during the programme from when their daughter would have been heavily pregnant but barely displayed any physical signs. The then 18-year-old wore a bikini on a family holiday months prior to the birth, and her mum showed photos of Richardson with her athletics team where \u201cyou can\u2019t tell\u201d she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s her track (team) photo. This was track season in April \u2014 and you can\u2019t tell. Seriously, we missed everything,\u201d Mrs Richardson said.\n\nDays before giving birth, Richardson also attended her ball wearing a form-fitting dress.\n\nConversations surrounding her weight were also out of the question, given Richardson had endured long battles with various eating disorders.\n\nThe Richardsons said they sought help from doctors, therapists and nutritionists, and eventually Skylar was diagnosed with body dysmorphia, but ultimately this didn\u2019t help and the family grew fearful of discussing her appearance.\n\n#48Hours has the real story behind the headlines in \u201cThe Case Against Brooke Skylar Richardson,\u201d Saturday at 10/9c. https://t.co/Ilyt26xWcB pic.twitter.com/0P80Vc7oaG \u2014 48 Hours (@48hours) September 27, 2019\n\nThe remains of Richardson\u2019s daughter, who she named Annabelle, were found in May 2017 - Richardson said the baby was stillborn but she was accused of crushing the child to death and setting her on fire before burying the infant in a shallow grave.\n\nIn a surprise bargain deal during her trial, the state offered a plea deal that would have seen the charge of aggravated murder removed if she pleaded guilty to the rest of her charges.\n\nRichardson refused the deal, which still could have seen her spend 15 years behind bars.\n\n\u201cIt was a Sunday morning and she woke up \u2014 and I can still see her sitting on the couch. And she goes, I\u2019m not going to plea to something I didn\u2019t do. And in my heart I got sick \u2014 but it has to be her decision. End of day, she has to live with this,\u201d Mrs Richardson said.\n\nHow could it happen?\n\nWhen she finally heard the truth of what had happened, Mrs Richardson said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t feel my body\u201d.\n\n\u201cI could not get up. \u2026 How could that happen? I\u2019ve seen her every day. I look at her. I talk to her. I hug her. I was a grandmother and I never had any of the benefits of it.\u201d\n\nThe defense shows these pictures.\n\n\n\nPhoto right from Feb 2017\n\nPhoto left from May 5th, 2017. #BrookeSkylarRichardson\u2019s delivery date was May 7th, 2017.\n\nSame dress in both photos-no alternations. #OHvRichardson#courttv pic.twitter.com/j2YuV193en \u2014 Chanley Sh\u00e1 Painter (@ChanleyCourtTV) 4 September 2019\n\nMr Richardson said the actions of his daughter were hard to comprehend, but in the given circumstance, it\u2019s possible she thought she was doing the right thing.\n\nAccording to a gynaecologist, the foetus was affected by intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), a condition that restricts the child from growing at a normal rate, WCPO reported.\n\nGiven the symptoms associated, the specialist said it was possible the condition had caused Richardson\u2019s baby to be stillborn.\n\nRichardson, who now goes by her middle name Skylar, will complete an eating disorder treatment program with the intention of beginning a university course next year.", "description": "Parents of accused baby killer Brooke Skylar Richardson have spoken of the ordeal for the first time, saying they had no idea she was ever pregnant.", "authors": ["Yahoo Uk Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nJ5zaIIm09idfe607CW7VA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/3947fa90-e28f-11e9-874f-27d96c918498", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
