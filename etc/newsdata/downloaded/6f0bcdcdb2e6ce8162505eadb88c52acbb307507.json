Results revealed a joint dislocation in his left ankle which has caused damage to the peroneus longus tendon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The player will meet for further consultations with Professor Ramon Cugat in Barcelona on Wednesday, where they will seek to reach a decision on whether surgical intervention is necessary.\u2019\n\nSanchez has been plagued by injury problems over the past year, missing a number of games for United due to separate hamstring, thigh, knee and ankle issues prior to his move away.\n\nThe winger\u2019s international manager Reinaldo Rueda, meanwhile, suggested that he could be unavailable for the next three months depending on what course of action Inter decide to take.\n\n\u2018If he has surgery you will lose him for two to three months, if not, it can be weeks, that depends on the club,\u2019 Rueda said.\n\n\u2018You always want to have them all here and losing Alexis is a shame, he was cheerful and super motivated.\u2019\n\nSanchez\u2019s only goal for Inter so far came during a 3-1 win over struggling Sampdoria in September (Picture: Getty)\n\nRegardless of how well Sanchez performs during his time in Italy, it appears unlikely that he has any sort of future at Old Trafford following a disastrous 18-month spell at the club.\n\nAccording to reports last week, United are hoping to recoup a \u00a325m fee for Sanchez which seems ambitious unless he can rediscover his best form during his stint at Inter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Alexis Sanchez looks set for a prolonged period on the sidelines after suffering a dislocated ankle and accompanying tendon damage while playing for Chile against Colombia on Saturday.
