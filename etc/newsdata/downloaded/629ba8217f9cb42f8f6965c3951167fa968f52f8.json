REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo\n\nA leading foreign policy hawk, Bolton was widely known to have pressed the Republican president not to let up pressure on North Korea despite diplomatic efforts. He had also argued against the president\u2019s suggestions of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership and advocated a tougher approach on Russia and, more recently, Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. and foreign lawmakers, officials and policy analysts reacted swiftly to the unexpected news:\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, a top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of John Bolton. I\u2019ve worked very well with him, and in my view he did a good job. But ultimately that\u2019s the president\u2019s decision to make. He has the right to have people around him that he wants.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s emblematic of President Trump\u2019s style. He wants people who basically are yes-men. I may not have agreed with Ambassador Bolton on a whole host of issues and his bellicose views, but the one thing about him is he obviously presented counterviews at times for his (Trump\u2019s) consideration. That\u2019s not something the president wants.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the White House:\n\n\u201c.... I don\u2019t think that any leader around the world should make any assumption that because some one of us departs that President Trump\u2019s foreign policy will change in a material way. ... There were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed, that\u2019s to be sure, but that\u2019s true for lots of people with whom I interact.\u201d\n\nIranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei wrote on Twitter:\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton had promised months ago that Iran would last for another three months. We are still standing and he is gone. With the expulsion of the biggest proponent of war and economic terrorism, the White House will face fewer obstacles in understanding Iran\u2019s realities.\u201d\n\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cThis firing of the national security advisor is just the latest reminder that the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy is in complete disarray. ... American leadership is desperately needed around the world. Instead, our national security decision-making process is in chaos and America is less safe.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described Bolton as a friend, and told Reuters:\n\n\u201cI think the president honestly thinks he can negotiate a deal with Iran. And I think Bolton has his own views that you can\u2019t negotiate with the Taliban, you can\u2019t negotiate with the ayatollah. And I think that fundamentally that\u2019s at odds with where the president wants to go, in terms that he wants to negotiate a better relationship with our enemies.\u201d\n\nNorbert Roettgen, chairman of the foreign policy commission of the German parliament and senior lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party, told Reuters:\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity, not leastly for the trans-Atlantic relationship.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea expert Harry Kazianis, a senior director at the Center for the National Interest think tank, said in an email:\n\n\u201cFor anyone like myself who wants the United States to return to a more restrained and realist foreign policy, the firing of John Bolton was long overdue and a smart move for Team Trump. ... Trump is now free to find a national security adviser who is against wars of regime change, a smaller footprint in the Middle East, some sort of diplomatic track with North Korea and a much bigger focus on the rise of China.\u201d\n\nRichard Gowan, International Crisis Group U.N. director, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cBolton brought his trademark dislike of the U.N. and other international institutions like the ICC (International Criminal Court) to the White House. On his watch, the U.S. has ensured that the U.N. has been marginalized on crises from Libya to Venezuela. The Trump administration was highly sceptical of multilateralism before Bolton\u2019s arrival, and is unlikely to embrace it warmly now he has gone. But the U.S. may devote a little less time and energy to weakening U.N. institutions.\u201d\n\nSenator Ben Cardin, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters:\n\n\u201cYou know, I would normally say \u2018shocked\u2019 but nothing in this administration shocks you today. Mr. Bolton and I didn\u2019t agree on a lot of issues. But he was a straight shooter. He knows the circumstances. I\u2019m sure he told the president what was going on. The president may not have liked to hear it. And it\u2019s unfortunate if the president won\u2019t accept professional advice.\u201d\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, who is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, wrote on Twitter:\n\n\u201cA symptom of the problem is gone. The root cause of authoritarianism remains.\u201d\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, a Democratic member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton was the wrong choice and the silver lining to this instability is that there will be fewer people whispering war chants in the president\u2019s ear. But no one of any quality is going to take a job in the nation\u2019s national security cabinet so long as everyone\u2019s head is permanently hovering slightly above the chopping block.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, like every other president, has the right to a National Security Advisor of his own choosing. I hope the president will choose someone with a strong background in national security and a world view that there is no substitute for American power when it comes to world order and that strength is better than weakness.\u201d\n\nAsked earlier in the day who would now speak to U.S. allies from the White House, Graham said:\n\n\u201cProbably Trump.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has fired national security adviser John Bolton amid disagreements over how to handle foreign policy challenges such as North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Russia.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428413756&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891V7", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
