Well worth the price of an op-ed arguing with a straight face that high drug prices that often result in ordinary people dying are socially valuable. Another poorly-written op-ed from the same day criticizes Democrats for trying to stop the Trump administration from allowing states to sell junk health insurance plans, courtesy of the president of the Buckeye Institute, a right-wing, Koch-funded think tank.\n\n\n\nAgain, these op-ed efforts are targeted at less than 500 people roaming the Beltway fiefdom. Outside of this minute population, literally nobody cares about, let alone reads, the ruminations of the senior fellows who staff Washington\u2019s ersatz think tanks, churned out to satisfy the whims of dotty donors. No one. Not even their mums care. This content doesn\u2019t excite Google\u2019s algorithms. Your friends are never going to excitedly pollute your Facebook feeds with these great works.\n\nNevertheless, The Hill persists in being a platform for this boring garbage. The site also publishes op-eds from liberal think-tanks and advocates. These tend to be fewer, however, as the right simply has more money to waste on this stuff. Just check out the balance of their opinion pieces on, for example, Medicare for All to see this in action.\n\n\n\nBut above all else, The Hill\u2019s opinion section just reeks of the same laziness Solomon displays. In 2016, the paper ran an op-ed from Michael Flynn about how great Turkey\u2019s government is without disclosing that Flynn was a paid agent of said Turkish government. In 2018, the paper ran an op-ed from former senator Norm Coleman praising the Trump administration for junking the Iran nuclear deal, without noting in his bio that Coleman was a long-time paid agent of Saudi Arabia. In 2015, a truly asinine op-ed written on behalf of for-profit education companies was published with an aside written by the piece\u2019s ghostwriter left in: \u201c(or from an employer perspective, if that fits the writer).\u201d Whichever public affairs firm drafted this piece didn\u2019t even know who was going to stick their name on it when they wrote it! If you are going to run an opinion section that serves as a platform for the lies of frauds and lobbyists, you could at least do them the courtesy of checking their copy for embarrassing mistakes.\n\nWe have here a collision of two bizarre media ecosystems. First, the conservative media fever swamp-to-mainstream media pipeline\u2014which is by no means new to the Trump administration; it\u2019s how we got years of absurd Benghazi investigations under Obama. Second, the role of The Hill as what seems to be a publication with imperceptible editorial standards for the opinion section, where anyone, whether it\u2019s a paid-off think tank goon or the paper\u2019s executive president, can really just say any old nonsense they like.\n\n\n\nThose who profit most handsomely in Washington have long benefited from organizations that will transform their naked financial interests into simulacra of compelling public interest, from think tanks that spout the views of their industry funders, to media outlets that will publish those industries\u2019 thin justifications for their greed\u2014or partner with them to do boring but slick panels and festivals, where everyone pretends to listen and eats the free breakfast. It shouldn\u2019t be a shock when one of the worst offenders for idea-laundering turns out to be an equally fruitful platform for batty right-wing nonsense. To no one\u2019s surprise, muck unleashed from the heights of our K Street redoubts eventually flows down The Hill.", "description": "John Solomon's role in laundering Trump's Ukraine scandal is just the latest black mark on the dodgy D.C. newspaper.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/820b1715adb505ec6cce6dc351f04cb976f774de.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
