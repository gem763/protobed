ABC's Kyra Phillips has more for us. Good morning, Kyra. Good morning, Eva. Well, agency the president resists democratic attempts to produce documents and administration witnesses for this impeachment inquiry, the clash between two branches of government intensifies. Reporter: For several long hours, the inspector general of the Intel community Michael Atkinson testified behind closed doors on capitol hill. It was Atkinson that deemed the whistle-blower complaint at the center of the impeachment inquiry an urgent concern. Democratic lawmakers seem pleased with the inspector general's testimony. But for his reporting this to congress, the efforts of the white house and the justice department to cover it up might have been successful. Reporter: Meanwhile Republicans took aim at the chairman of the committee, representative Adam Schiff. Chairman Schiff should be disqualified from running an investigation where his committee, members or staff, are fact witnesses about contact with the whistle-blower and the whistle-blower process. Reporter: Democrats, though, are undeterred. Now pursuing a new target in the trump Ukraine drama, vice president Mike pence. The committees leading the impeachment probe sent a letter Friday requesting a laundry list of documents and communications to determine pence's knowledge of trump asking Ukraine to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden. The committee's also asking for requests, suggestion, proposals or other communications surrounding the president's decision to not send his vice president to zelensky's inauguration in may. Now, pence's office is rejecting this demand, dismissing it as, quote, a do nothing Democrats move, slamming the party for trying to call attention to what pence's office termed a partisan impeachment. Dan. Kyra, thank you very much. Kyra Phillips on capitol hill for us. So much to talk about here so let's bring in our ringer, ABC news chief political analyst Matthew dowd. Matt, great to have you on set. Did you add the extra hour just because of what's going on? Yes, exactly, we want to give you room to breathe. Let's go back to \"The New York Times\" report that there may be a second whistle-blower about to come forward. To you, what's the significance of this? I think every time there is a new witness to what happened, a new witness to say what the president say he did what they say he also did raisesed odds that the president is going to get impeached. I don't think right now it raises the odds he would get convicted in the senate but I think today if you looked at the house of representatives today and if a new whistle-blower appears and does confirm what happened, the president will get impeached in the house if that happens. Also the Republicans have been trying to discredit the original whistle-blower. If there had been two it's maybe harder to discredit both of them at the same time. Let me talk about Joe Biden. We saw in David Wright's piece he's making his most extensive comments since this story broke. How is he doing in the light of this story and is this likely to help or hinder him? I think he was having difficulty in this campaign process because of the energy that Elizabeth Warren had created. I think this gives him a moment that can only help him. He basically becomes the opponent to Donald Trump in the midst of this conversation and all the Democrats seem now to defend him in this process. It has to help him in this. I don't think it'll fundamentally change the nature of the race which puts him in a position of running against Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and others but it's got to help when he pivots one-on-one against Donald Trump. And let's finally talk about the Republicans. We've seen a few come out to criticize the president, Mitt Romney, Ben sasse. Do you expect others will break or is there going to be a red wall here? Well, until there's more U.S. Republican senators than whistle-blowers coming out, it's going to be difficult for the Democrats to get this done. I think it all depends on the facts that emerge. Does it confirm in a distinct way that there was a quid pro quo, if this new whistle-blower, I think you can see a number of senators, I have a serious doubt if it will ever get up to 20 Republican senators going against the president. And that's what's needed to convict him in the senate and remove him from office. That's what's needed to convict him but if you get three or four Republican, they can change the rules in how the process happens in the united\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "House Democrats are moving forward with the impeachment inquiry, seeking new documents and gathering testimony from key witnesses.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191005_gma_phillips_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
