the footsteps of his family\u2019s political dynasty. He is the grandson of the former attorney-general Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 while running for the White House. Former President John F Kennedy and the late Senator Edward M Kennedy are both his great-uncles, while his father, Joseph P Kennedy II, was a representative in Boston.\n\nWhereas the former president successfully managed to challenge incumbent President Jimmy Carter for the party\u2019s nomination in 1980, Mr Kennedy may find his path to the Senate slightly-more complicated under Mr Markey.\n\nThe senator is popular in his home-state and across the country, having received endorsements from top liberal and progressive politicians nationwide. Elizabeth Warren, another Massachusetts senator who is running for president, has thrown her support behind Mr Markey \u2014 even as Mr Kennedy campaigns for her in their home-state.\n\n\"I couldn't ask for a better partner in the United States Senate than Ed Markey. He's worked very hard on a lot of issues for a very long time,\u201d she told CBS News last week.\n\nIn response to Ms Warren\u2019s decision to endorse Mr Markey, Mr Kennedy told reporters: \u201cPrimaries get messy. And I totally understand that. I respect her and the position of other folks in the delegation.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In a campaign video posted by Mr Markey, the popular freshman Democrat shared a story of how the senator welcomed her ideas to Capitol Hill with open arms, eventually co-sponsoring the Green New Deal initiative.\n\nBoth Mr Kennedy and Mr Markey are considered progressive Democrats, though they aren\u2019t entirely identical. While Mr Kennedy comes from one of the most prominent American political families in history, Mr Markey comes from a working class family in Malden, Massachusetts.\n\nStill, Mr Kennedy will have a clear advantage against several other candidates in the primary race according to the latest polling. In a five-person race, the 35-year-old representative reportedly bests Mr Markey with a 9 per cent lead.", "description": "Joe Kennedy seemed to have his sights set on the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination when he delivered the official response to Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address last year.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/15/joe-kennedy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
