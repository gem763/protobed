He had full security clearance in an office that coordinated counter-terrorist intelligence-gathering in the capital.\n\nCounter-terrorist investigators are now investigating what led him to launch a knife attack on police officers he worked with, whether it was premeditated and whether he entered the building with his own knife.\n\nAt lunchtime on Thursday, deep inside the vast police complex near Notre Dame in the centre of Paris, the man took a ceramic knife and launched a killing spree which lasted only a few minutes. First, in an office in his own department, he killed three police intelligence officers. Then he took a stairway, killing another staff member and injuring two more before heading towards the exit. A young intern police officer, who had worked in the building for only a few days, called for the man to drop the knife. When he did not, the young officer shot him in the head, killing him.\n\nThere were no surviving witnesses from the room where he first attacked and killed three officers, so it is not clear what he may have said to them before the attack.\n\nInitially the killings had been treated as homicides and investigated by regular police. As searches and checks continued at the assailant\u2019s home, the counter-terrorism force was called in and police officials said nomotive was being ruled out.\n\nPolice on Friday continued to search the attacker\u2019s home in a small town near Charles de Gaulle airport north of the city. Data from his computers and phones was also being assessed. Within hours of the attack, investigators in balaclavas were seen removing computer equipment from the property.\n\nThe assailant, who was French and born on the island of Martinique, had converted to Islam 18 months ago, but initial searches at his home were reported to have shown no sign of any radicalisation. He had not been on any watchlist.\n\nThe government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said on Friday morning that the possibility of a terror motive \u201chas clearly not been ruled out\u201d. But she added: \u201cIt is important to emphasise you are not a terrorist because you are Muslim and converting to Islam is not an automatic sign of radicalisation.\u201d She told France Info radio: \u201cThe facts need to be looked at carefully.\u201d\n\nThe interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said the assailant had \u201cnever shown any behavioural problems\u201d and never aroused the \u201cslightest reason for alarm\u201d. The attacker was said to be a quiet and unassuming member of staff, and no change in his behaviour had been noted in the weeks before the attack.\n\nParis\u2019s police chief, Didier Lallement, said on Friday that the force would be \u201cforever marked by this drama. We will not forget.\u201d\n\nThe attacker\u2019s widow told investigators that her husband, who had a severe hearing disability, displayed \u201cunusual and agitated behaviour\u201d the night before his crime, a source close to the investigation told AFP. She was questioned all day on Friday.\n\nThe attack came a day after thousands of officers marched in Paris to protest against low wages, long hours and an increasing suicide rate in their ranks.", "description": "State employee killed four colleagues at police headquarters before being shot dead", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec932398e411f854e8711d3d267899897f00c4c8/0_303_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=244818752a41519909b48208a6a96805", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
