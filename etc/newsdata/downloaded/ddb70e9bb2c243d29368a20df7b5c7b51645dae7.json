His comments came after the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the deliberations, that an \u201cinterim\u201d chief executive would be installed by March if President Xi Jinping decides to carry out the plan.\n\n\u201cThey recently assessed that this could go on for a while,\u201d Tien said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cDragging this thing out is actually bad for everyone, for Hong Kong, the police. So now they need to sort of take action. And I have heard it\u2019s going to be next year, probably February or March.\u201d\n\nLam\u2019s replacement wouldn\u2019t necessarily stay on for a full five-year term. Tien said Beijing was weighing two different scenarios: Either appointing a \u201ccaretaker\u201d who would serve the remainder of Lam\u2019s term, or try out someone who could conceivably stay on after the next election for chief executive in 2022. Tien said a replacement would need to be elected by the 1,200-member election committee.\n\nA spokesman for Lam\u2019s office declined to comment on the speculation over her position.\n\nThe Financial Times said Norman Chan, former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Henry Tang, who previously served city\u2019s No. 2 official, were leading candidates to succeed Lam. Both Tang and Chan declined to comment on the FT report Wednesday.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry on Wednesday said the central government still firmly supports Lam, reiterating Beijing\u2019s long-standing position.\n\n\u201cThis is a political rumor with ulterior motives,\u201d spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular briefing.\n\nReplacing Lam would represent a delicate reversal for Xi\u2019s Communist Party, which doesn\u2019t want to give a victory to protesters demanding direct elections. Still, Beijing is under pressure to ease months of unrest, which has helped push the city toward recession and provided ammunition to the party\u2019s critics from Taipei to Washington.\n\nLam\u2019s introduction of legislation allowing extraditions to China sparked months of increasingly violent protests against Beijing\u2019s tightening grip over the city. Her moves to withdraw the bill -- which formally took place Wednesday -- and invoke a colonial-era emergency law to ban face masks have done little to stem the chaos.\n\n\u201cBusiness should not expect that the removal of Lam will end the civil unrest,\u201d Verisk Maplecroft, a consultancy that advises businesses on political risk, said in a note on Wednesday. \u201cNo matter who the next chief executive is, the protesters will continue to demand an independent investigation into police conduct amid widespread dissatisfaction with how the authorities are managing the demonstrations.\u201d\n\nLam told a gathering of business people that she had caused \u201chuge havoc\u201d and would quit \u201cif I had a choice,\u201d according to audio excerpts released by Reuters last month. She subsequently told reporters that she never asked China for permission to resign over the historic unrest rocking the city.\n\nIf Lam resigns, responsibility for leading the city of 7.5 million would fall immediately to Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, who can act as chief executive for as long as six months. Before that interim period ends, the city\u2019s 1,200-member Election Committee comprised overwhelmingly of Beijing loyalists must meet to select a new leader.\n\nIn 2005, Hong Kong\u2019s first post-colonial leader, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned after mass protests forced him to withdraw China-backed national security legislation. Tung, a shipping magnate, held onto the job for more than a year after the demonstrations peaked as the party settled on a succession plan.\n\n\u2018New Face\u2019\n\nOpposition lawmaker Claudia Mo said last week that Lam\u2019s resignation could help ease tensions.\n\n\u201cShe can go, if she wants to,\u201d Mo told Bloomberg Television. \u201cYou might say, \u2018What\u2019s the point of having Carrie Lam gone? There would just be another puppet in place.\u2019 But at least we can have a new face, and let\u2019s have a restart, if possible, between the government and the people.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese government is considering a plan to replace Hong Kong\u2019s Carrie Lam as chief executive, pro-establishment lawmaker Michael Tien said, in a potential strategy shift by Beijing as pro-democracy demonstrations continue to rock the Asian financial center.Tien said he has information", "authors": ["Blake Schmidt", "Iain Marlow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TyjPgUt5xTRTO4Y15VBSpw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f165dad4024462cf46eda397cddec65d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
