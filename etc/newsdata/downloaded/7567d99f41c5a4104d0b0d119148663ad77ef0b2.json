Encore, now eleven minutes longer, differs from the original film mostly in the way it preserves Coppola\u2019s early, unique depiction of American race culture. This version expands on the opening line of The Godfather: \u201cI believe in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoppola takes on the anthropological irony of a white-owned club in Harlem where blacks performed yet were not allowed to attend and mix with the segregated audience. Encore\u2019s opening scene shows a black doorman (played by Woody Strode, the legendary star of John Ford\u2019s race epic Sergeant Rutledge) refusing admission to a black woman who passes for white. (David Levering Lewis\u2019s When Harlem Was in Vogue recounts that even W. C. Handy was turned away.) Meanwhile, white musician Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere) and black dancer Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines) partake of the establishment\u2019s ironic apartheid work policy.\n\nThis paradox at the core of the film\u2019s concept (juxtaposing white and black society) is responsible for its oddity and explains why it still doesn\u2019t work. Coppola hired New York folk-novelist William Kennedy to do a Ragtime-style adaptation, and though the story\u2019s biracial narrative predates the concept of \u201cwoke,\u201d it remains uneven. Encore exposes \u201cwokeness\u201d (self-satisfying social progress) as deeply delusional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEncore distills American ambition through the violent and artistic contrasts of complementary brother duos (Gere and Nicolas Cage, Gregory and Maurice Hines) who take divergent paths toward power and self-realization.\n\nCoppola\u2019s prismatic narrative reflects both Hollywood and New York history when Dixie becomes a George Raft\u2013inspired film star and the Williams brothers evoke the Nicholas brothers. Behind-the-scenes gangster drama reflects the private struggles performed on stage by segregated performers who hide their anguish in art. Musical numbers by Lonette McKee and Diane Lane of \u201cAm I Blue,\u201d \u201cIll Wind,\u201d and \u201cStormy Weather\u201d recalled 1920s anxieties in the face of Reagan-era aspiration \u2014 now post-Obama disappointment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Encore re-edit underscores Coppola\u2019s unsentimental awareness of the complexities in American culture and the ambition of citizens confronting its system. He restores and lengthens certain scenes (a family dinner conflict, a romantic tiff, and an Apache dance) to emphasize ethnic and gender complexity \u2014 the same ingenuity that would later enrich The Godfather, Part III (1990) while disappointing some viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHollywood establishment figures don\u2019t get sufficient credit for their humanitarian screen efforts that are easily scoffed at as cornball. The Cotton Club was an experiment in commercialism and aesthetics that tested Hollywood\u2019s commitment to social consciousness. Coppola addresses racism in the aftermath of that stinging Godfather line about blacks (\u201cLet them lose their souls, they\u2019re animals anyway\u201d). It follows the alarming Do Long Bridge scene of Apocalypse Now where a troop of black soldiers are desperately, hopelessly lost in a quagmire \u2014 Coppola\u2019s daring metaphor for America\u2019s urban ghettoes.\n\nIt was commercial custom that forced Coppola to focus The Cotton Club on the white characters \u2014 Gere, Lane, the gangsters Dutch Schultz (ferocious James Remar), Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins), and Frenchy Demange (Fred Gwynne), the latter two depicted as a pair of brotherly cut-throat entrepreneurs. Coppola, who had directed the film version of the pioneering race musical Finian\u2019s Rainbow, attempts to correct the imbalance of this Robert Evans production by making the musical numbers Brechtian \u2014 as in the closing montage intercutting a Harlem stage performance. The contrast of the stage and the train station is an alienated (post-Cabaret) concept of entertainment, mixing multiple real and surreal leavetakings at Grand Central Station. This is the film\u2019s most successful experiment, but it would take Robert Altman\u2019s 1996 masterpiece Kansas City to get this all-American mayhem right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoppola shows off sex and race dynamics in scene\u2019s where Gere\u2019s and Lane\u2019s bodies are covered by a Bertoluccian lace scrim and a didactic speech by Harlem gangster Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne): \u201cI ain\u2019t got to do nothin\u2019 but be black and die. The white man ain\u2019t left me nothin\u2019 out here . . . that is where I dance.\u201d\n\nEncore is a social-consciousness musical, brought back to challenge an era in which social consciousness itself isn\u2019t enough.\n\n* * *\n\nEncore may outlast Coppola\u2019s recent statement siding with Martin Scorsese\u2019s critique of Marvel film culture: \u201cWhen Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he\u2019s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesting the social meanings of film is something Marvel movies resolutely don\u2019t do. When Coppola says, \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again,\u201d he is also explaining his desire to make The Cotton Club relevant to a new millennium. Speaking from an outdated era, Coppola \u2014 joined so far by Ken Loach, Brian De Palma, Pedro Almod\u00f3var, and Fernando Mierelles \u2014 supports Scorsese. Consider The Cotton Club Encore re-edit a defiant artistic stance.", "description": "A review of 'Cotton Club Encore', directed by Francis Ford Coppola", "authors": ["Armond White", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
