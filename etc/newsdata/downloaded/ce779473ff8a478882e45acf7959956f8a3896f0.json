There is widespread revulsion amongst the Scottish public that these birds continue to suffer greatly at the hands of wildlife criminals. Our published data from Birdcrime 2018 shows that this damage is both current and significant, and reinforces why robust regulation of driven grouse shooting is urgently needed.\u201d\n\nGrouse moor estates are increasingly drawing criticism for their effect on native wildlife and climate change, with many calling for shoots to be banned.\n\nThis latest report comes just weeks after a Channel 4 report suggested hundreds of animals, including weasels, badgers, goshawks and buzzards were being killed on grouse moors.\n\n\u201cThe Scottish Government has led the way in the UK by commissioning an independent review into the impacts of driven grouse shooting,\u201d said Mr Orr-Ewing. \u201cThis is a seminal moment and a chance for Scottish Government to tackle raptor crime by bringing grouse moor management under regulation, and giving greater recognition to the public interest in the way such sporting estates are managed.\n\n\u201cSanctions to remove licences to shoot should be available to act as a strong deterrent to those who currently break wildlife protection laws, and engage in other damaging land management practices.\"\n\nIn England, there were 67 recorded incidents \u2013 with just five in Wales and three in Northern Ireland.\n\nOf the 87 in 2018\u2019s report, only one has resulted in a prosecution \u2013 with only one prosecution from 68 recorded incidents in 2017.\n\nThe figures do not include incidents where no bodies were recovered, however, with RSPB Scotland referencing a number of cases of satellite-tagged birds going missing in suspicious circumstances.\n\nA Scottish Gamekeepers Association spokesman said the group would \u201cawait the official independent statistics from Scottish Government\u201d, lamenting how the RSPB\u2019s \u201cunofficial report each year gets overtaken by the official figures approved by the relevant agencies.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have been pleased to see the official statistics showing an establish pattern of year on year decline in raptor poisoning in Scotland, including the lowest figures ever recorded, in last year\u2019s Government statement. The SGA has a proven stance against wildlife crime, removing eight members in seven years for wildlife crime convictions. We do not condone raptor crime.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with RSPB regarding Muirburn (Code) and their views on mountain hares, which stem from a study which has since been scientifically proven to have utilised the least reliable count method available. Until independent agencies monitor satellite tags, which the SGA is petitioning Parliament for currently, we regard RSPB\u2019s claims regarding satellite tags as speculative and lacking in verifiable evidence.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "Illegal killings of birds of prey in Scotland has more than doubled in a year and all of the incidents happened on or near land used for driven grouse shooting, according to the\u00a0Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).\u00a0 The charity's\u00a0Birdcrime\u00a0report\u00a0found there were at least 12 incidents in 201, up from five the previous year.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/29/16/istock-961619810.jpg"}
