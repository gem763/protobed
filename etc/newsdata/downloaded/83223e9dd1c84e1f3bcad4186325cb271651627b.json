Instead of waiting around, Tim decided to go straight for his carry-on behind his row and as soon as passengers were allowed to stand \u2014 and another passenger openly expressed her disapproval toward his actions.\n\n\u201cI took matters into my own hands and I would do it again,\u201d Tim said coldly.\n\nReaders, is Tim a monster? The Washington Post recently covered this subject of deplaning etiquette and who has the right to get to the gate first. The basic rules of getting off a plane shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, assuming you\u2019re on a flight with a single exit in front: Passengers in front, followed by those in the back.\n\nAnd aisle seats first, followed by those in the middle and window seat, which should go without saying. (A passenger in front always has precedence over those behind them, even if they\u2019re in an aisle.) The main reason for these rules is to allow passengers to deplane with the least amount of friction in the process, and to ensure a smooth transition between flights.\n\nThere are several exceptions I\u2019d make to these rules, however. For one, if you\u2019re taking an especially long time to unbuckle your seatbelt, it\u2019s perfectly ok for others to proceed before you. No one should have to wait on you and it might take the pressure off you if you\u2019re struggling to get up from your seat.\n\nIf you have a quick connection, I\u2019ll also let you through, assuming you make that request known to other passengers; yes, you\u2019ll meet a passenger who will grumble at the request, but for the most part, we\u2019ve all dealt with the experience of rushing to a gate. (The Post recommends letting an attendant know this in advance, so they can provide you with gate information or find you a seat up front upon landing.)\n\nTim\u2019s situation is a unique one and he makes a strong case; after all, he would have had to deplane last had he not preemptively grabbed his bag. Unfortunately, it\u2019s just not what would be considered a best practice.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, overhead compartment space is a first-come, first-serve commodity; if you board last, you\u2019re shit out of luck. And if you board late and are forced to stow your bag behind you, sorry Tim, you were knee-deep in shit.\n\nOn the other hand, he did have several alternative solutions to his problem. The first answer would have involved some polite shoving, while informing his fellow passengers of the need to grab his bag. If the bag was close enough to his seat, he could have also asked a passenger to assist him. (He wouldn\u2019t have made friends doing this, admittedly, but others might\u2019ve been more sympathetic.)\n\nThe other, easier option would have been to wait until he saw an opportunity to go for his bag when those behind him were stalled. Granted, there\u2019s only so much you can do if your bag is that far behind you, but it might have been worth a shot.\n\nSo to our readers, we ask: Do you get annoyed when passengers bolt up from their seats upon landing? What\u2019s the correct way to deplane a flight? And is Tim an unfeeling sociopath?", "description": "Back in August 2018, two passengers on a Frontier Airlines flight exchanged threats, which eventually turned into a brawl, while disembarking their plane; according to witnesses, one passenger bumped into the other while trying to grab his bag from the overhead compartment bin, sparking the fight....", "authors": ["Whitson Gordon", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/a1hepsimdsemxpdciszq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
