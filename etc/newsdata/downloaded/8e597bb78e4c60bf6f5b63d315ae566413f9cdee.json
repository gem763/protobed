Each of them has a conscience. Maybe they can\u2019t live with giving Trump a free pass on using military aid money to press another country to find dirt on his Democratic rival, Joe Biden Joe BidenKamala Harris calls for Twitter to suspend Trump account over whistleblower attacks Clinton jokes she 'never' had to tell Obama not to 'extort foreign countries' John Dean: 'There is enough evidence' to impeach Trump MORE.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the risk of sounding cynical, it does occur to me that Senate Republicans for the first time see Trump\u2019s scandal possibly costing them their majority.\n\nNext year, 23 Senate Republicans will be up for reelection with Trump at the top of the ticket.\n\nMurphy warned that, given Trump\u2019s antics, Senate Republicans are thinking they are \u201cgoing to lose Colorado with Cory Gardner Cory Scott GardnerThe policy-driven presidential campaign could be drowned out by impeachment Juan Williams: Trump's grip on GOP Senate may come loose Embracing President Mike Pence might be GOP's best play MORE. We\u2019re going to lose Maine with Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsYes, President Trump, we do have a homelessness crisis and you're making it harder for us to address The policy-driven presidential campaign could be drowned out by impeachment Flake tells GOP: Trump 'does not deserve reelection' MORE. We\u2019re going to lose Arizona with Martha McSally. And the Democrats will put the Senate very much in play.\u201d\n\nAt one time, Trump kept Capitol Hill Republicans in line by threatening to have his supporters back a primary challenge to any dissenting GOP member seeking reelection.\n\nNow, that threat has to be weighed against the increasing fear of a weakened president handing the Senate to Democrats.\n\nThere is evidence that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellOvernight Defense: Dems subpoena Giuliani for Ukraine docs | DOJ says Trump contacted foreign countries over Russia inquiry | Top Armed Services Republican Thornberry to retire | Milley sworn in as top general The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump steps up attacks on whistleblower, Schiff US sanctions Russian individuals for interference in 2018 elections MORE (R-Ky.) sees impeachment imperiling his majority next year.\n\nLast week, McConnell showed independence from Trump by coming out publicly in support of continuing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMore important, he also pushed the White House to share the whistleblower complaint with Congress.\n\nAnd McConnell has to deal with a well-known Senate Republican daring to separate himself from Trump on the Ukraine scandal \u2014 Sen. Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyTo win the federal paid family leave debate, allow states to lead the way Democrat argues GOP had 'no deep love or loyalty' to Trump Flake tells GOP: Trump 'does not deserve reelection' MORE (R-Utah).\n\nRomney said he is \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d to see reports of Trump pressuring the Ukrainian president to damage Biden. And he later told reporters: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine being in the Senate or in any other position of responsibility and looking around to see who\u2019s with you. You stand for what you believe in.\u201d\n\nLoss of the majority might prompt Republican senators to start their own version of the wave of retirements \u2014 15 so far \u2014 that have hit House Republicans since Democrats claimed that majority in the 2018 midterms.\n\nTeam Trump knows it has a problem. The president last week tweeted out a video of Romney\u2019s sad, losing face on the night of the 2012 presidential election.\n\nAnd Donald Trump Jr. Donald (Don) John TrumpJuan Williams: Trump's grip on GOP Senate may come loose Giuliani spars with Stephanopoulos over whistleblower report: 'Donald Trump was framed by the Democrats' Trump has done 38 retweets and counting ahead of intelligence official's testimony MORE described Romney as \u201cforever bitter that my father succeeded where he so embarrassingly failed.\u201d The son added that Romney is straying from the president because he is \u201cdesperate to be loved by the left and the media.\u201d\n\nBut Romney is not the only Republican willing to speak out.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse Benjamin (Ben) Eric SasseDemocrat argues GOP had 'no deep love or loyalty' to Trump Juan Williams: Trump's grip on GOP Senate may come loose GOP senators attack whistleblower's credibility MORE (R-Neb.) \u2014 who was recently endorsed for reelection by Trump \u2014 is on the record as saying Republicans \u201cought not just circle the wagons.\u201d\n\nAnd outside the Senate, Republican voices challenging Trump for the GOP nomination suddenly, thanks to impeachment, have a larger platform.\n\nFormer Massachusetts Gov. William Weld William (Bill) WeldJuan Williams: Trump's grip on GOP Senate may come loose Republicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump Tulsi Gabbard calls for foreign policy-focused debate MORE, one of three Republicans challenging Trump for the GOP nomination, said Trump\u2019s telephone call with the Ukrainian president amounted to \u201ctreason, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe shifting political dynamic among Republicans is a budding version of the sudden shift among moderate Democrats in the House that led Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiJohn Dean: 'There is enough evidence' to impeach Trump Ocasio-Cortez blasts McCarthy as a 'bumbling, sloppy, dishonest mess' over Trump defense DOJ says Trump contacted foreign countries to assist Barr's Russia inquiry MORE (D-Calif.) to announce the start of impeachment.\n\nPelosi shifted only after seven moderate freshman Democrats \u2014 several from districts Trump won in 2016 and all with national security backgrounds \u2014 penned an op-ed for The Washington Post calling for impeachment.\n\nUntil those moderates stood up, Pelosi had a clear reason to resist calls for impeachment. She was protecting them, and in doing so, boosting her own chances of keeping her House majority.\n\n\u201cAs members of Congress, we have prioritized delivering for our constituents \u2014 remaining steadfast in our focus on health care, infrastructure, economic policy and our communities\u2019 priorities,\u201d the seven freshmen wrote. \u201cYet everything we do harks back to our oaths to defend the country. These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nNow more than half the members of the US House of Representatives \u2014 223 as of Saturday \u2014 have come out in support of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThese politicians know how to read polls. And the polls are shifting in favor of impeachment, too.\n\nBefore Pelosi\u2019s announcement a majority of Americans opposed impeachment.\n\nLast week, an NPR/PBS/Marist poll found 49 percent backing for an impeachment inquiry and 46 percent opposition.\n\nThe preservation of political power, pure self-interest \u2014 from both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 is at the heart of the start of impeachment proceedings against the 45th president of the United States.\n\nCORRECTION: Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, members of Congress can force a vote every six months on Trump's declaration of a national emergency. The vote cannot be prevented by GOP leadership.
