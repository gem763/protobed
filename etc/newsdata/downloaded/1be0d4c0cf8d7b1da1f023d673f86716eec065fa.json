But there was one notable absence: Drake.\n\n\u201cDrizzy... Champagne Papi I\u2019m waiting for you,\u201d Andreescu revealed during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThere are a couple reasonable explanations that come to mind as to why the Toronto rapper may not have offered a salute.\n\n1) Drake has publicly supported Williams dating back to 2011. The two also had a romantic relationship in 2015. Perhaps the Grammy winner didn\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers by showing love to Andreescu, who has now won two titles at Williams\u2019 expense.\n\n2) Drake has been recovering from the Toronto Raptors\u2019 championship summer and simply doesn\u2019t have enough left in the tank for another epic celebration. Although the opportunity of bringing Andreescu and the U.S. Open trophy on stage at a concert like he famously did with the Larry OB seems too good to pass up.\n\nWhatever the reason for the silence, the ball is firmly in your court, Drake.
