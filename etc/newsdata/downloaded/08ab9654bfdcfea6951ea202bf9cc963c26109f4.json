even including using bird of prey kites - but how well do they work?\n\n\"It is important to point out that no deterrent is always 100% effective, and more than one gadget is sometimes needed for the desired effect,\" said the RSPB Scotland spokeswoman.\n\n\"RSPB has not tested gull deterrents and as such we cannot recommend any in particular.\n\n\"A deterrent must not prevent a bird access to an active nest, or trap a bird or injure it,\" she added.\n\nImage caption Queen of the South have tried a number of measures to address their problems\n\nIndeed, she stressed that the birds enjoyed protection which adds to the difficulty of dealing with them once they become an issue.\n\n\"All gulls are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981,\" she said.\n\n\"But the law also recognises that control measures may be necessary under certain conditions when non-lethal methods have been exhausted and are unable to resolve human conflict.\"\n\nAt that point, permission to kill the birds could be given.\n\nA licence to cull?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"General licences can be issued to prevent serious damage to agriculture and disease spread and to preserve public health and safety, or to conserve other wild birds,\" she explained.\n\n\"Nuisance or damage to property are not legitimate reasons for gull control.\"\n\nScottish Natural Heritage said there were two main ways for a local authority to control gulls.\n\n\"Exclusion is one - stopping the use of nests or using bird spikes - and the other is removal of nests with eggs,\" said a spokeswoman.\n\n\"In some cases, some types of gulls can be culled, but only under licence and only as a last resort when public health is at risk and all other options have been attempted.\"\n\nSend in the falcons?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dumfries and Galloway Council tried using birds of prey to keep gulls away from the town centre\n\nDumfries and Galloway Council is one local authority that already offers a free egg and nest removal system.\n\nIndeed, it has been something of a leader in field, with Dumfries having hosted a national \"gull summit\" back in 2008.\n\nThe following year an egg removal scheme was offered free of charge in the area for the first time.\n\nIt has been credited with driving numbers down - particularly in the town centre.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Litter from ripped open rubbish bags has been a problem\n\nHowever, problems with the birds have continued including:\n\nDirect stealing of food from people's hands\n\nSwooping and dive-bombing to protect chicks\n\nNoise issues, particularly at first light in residential areas\n\nMess on cars, buildings, washing, footpaths and people\n\nLitter caused by refuse bags being ripped open\n\nA number of different methods to tackle the problem have been tried out over the years in addition to the egg and nest removal.\n\nFalcons once flew in the skies over the town in a bid to deter roof-nesting gulls but it was deemed only a \"partial success\".\n\nThe installation of water sprayers on buildings was unsuccessful as infra-red sensors lost effectiveness in the summer.\n\nSpecial \"gull proof\" bin bags have also been offered to businesses.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Problems have reduced at Queen of the South's recent home games\n\nHowever, the local authority has repeatedly urged the public to help play its part in keeping the birds at bay.\n\nNew signs were put up in 2017 in a bid to stop feeding of the gulls and community safety officers also tried to discourage people from giving them food.\n\nA similar plea from Queen of the South - not to give the birds a half-time pie or chips - has appeared to help tackle their problems too.\n\nIn that way, perhaps, the Scottish football club might get more media coverage for its on-the-field exploits in future rather than having to rely on its feathered friends.", "description": "A Scottish football club has been plagued with issues -
