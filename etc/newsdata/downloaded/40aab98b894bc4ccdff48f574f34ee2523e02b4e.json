Sportsmail examines what the north London side need to do in order to pull off what appears to be impossible.\n\nJurgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino will meet for the first time since the Madrid final\n\nRestrict the full-backs\n\nSuch is the way Klopp sets up his Liverpool side, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold become absolutely vital cogs in the machine.\n\nStopping the flying full-backs is paramount, though by no means an easy task.\n\nSpurs should look to how Manchester United set up against the league leaders at Old Trafford last weekend to glean some inspiration.\n\nAndy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold are hugely impactful players for Liverpool\n\nWhile United remained largely passive in midfield, the formation used by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saw a back three with the use of additional wing-backs.\n\nBy playing in this way United were able to flood the space on the flanks and, most importantly, restrict these areas high up the field.\n\nBy constantly having Aaron Wan Bissaka and Ashley Young pressing up at Liverpool's end, both Robertson and Alexander-Arnold were denied their usual freedom to bolt forward and sequence in balls for the deadly trident of attack.\n\nIf Spurs overlook this potential tactical switch and simply look to play Liverpool at their own game, the consequences could be dire. By eliminating the full-backs though, the landscape of the match will be flipped.\n\nMan United almost kept Robertson quiet at Old Trafford, but for the crucial final minutes\n\nKlopp's side will have the benefit of the home advantage, though a 60,000 strong Anfield urging the players up the field could be just what Spurs need. Pochettino will be acutely aware he needs to place his opponents in a position whereby they are taking risks.\n\nThings cannot be made comfortable for Liverpool, and cutting the source of free-flowing football from the creative full-backs would be a prime area to begin.\n\nTarget Dejan Lovren\n\nCroatian centre-half Lovren has made his way back into Klopp's plans in recent weeks, due to an unfortunate injury to Virgil van Dijk's first-choice partner Joel Matip.\n\nMatip returned for the most recent trip to Old Trafford, though Lovren came back into the side in midweek against Genk in the Champions League.\n\nKlopp is understood to be ready to hand Lovren another start against Pochettino's side, and Spurs must quickly make a note of this.\n\nHaving divided opinion on Merseyside ever since his arrival, Lovren frequently blows hot and cold on the football pitch.\n\nDejan Lovren has come back into the side in recent weeks following injury to Joel Matip\n\nA defensive masterclass one weekend can be followed by an error-strewn panic the next. This trait of inconsistency, paired with the fact Lovren is short on recent first team action, presents Spurs with an option to capitalise.\n\nIt was Lovren's mistake in Belgium on Wednesday which allowed Genk to sneak a consolation goal.\n\nDallying on the ball on the touchline, Lovren was shouldered out of possession by Jere Uronen who quickly found Dieumerci Ndongala. Another swift pass and substitute Stephen Odey had scored.\n\nAt Anfield, Lovren will be up against markedly stronger opponents. Though Harry Kane will be watched like a hawk by Van Dijk, Spurs must attempt to usher him into solo encounters with Lovren.\n\nWith the stakes as high as they currently are, any mistake could be crucial.\n\nGet in behind\n\nThis season Liverpool are playing a noticeably higher defensive line, and squeezing the life out of their opponents in the process.\n\nEven during the games in which they have not quite clicked into top gear, the Reds have always been a threat simply because they are relentlessly on top of their opponents.\n\nPochettino will be aware of this, and has no doubt spent the last week working out how to possibly counter this to his own benefit.\n\nThough it is usually Fabinho who drops in to help the central defenders as Liverpool push forward, spaces can often appear out wide as the full-backs stretch the play.\n\nThe pace of Son Heung-Min and the movement of Harry Kane must be utilised by Tottenham\n\nSpurs can exploit this space, when it presents itself, and certainly have the personnel to do so.\n\nTurning a counter-attack around quickly should not prove too difficult with players such as Harry Winks and Christian Eriksen boasting sublime passing ability.\n\nIn Son, Spurs have one of the most electric forwards in the Premier League. Perhaps only the likes of Sadio Mane and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang can rival the South Korean for pace, and his goalscoring record proves he has the finishing ability to match.\n\nWith Kane's hold-up play also set to be pivotal, don't be surprised if Son begins his searching runs from the get-go.\n\nUnhinge the Brazilian metronomes\n\nWhile each man plays an important and specific role for league leaders Liverpool, it can be argued that no players fulfill more unique demands than Roberto Firmino and Fabinho.\n\nThe Brazilian duo are central pivots for this Liverpool team, and opponents have frequently targeted the pair as a result.\n\nIn midfield Fabinho acts as the lighthouse for his side, signalling danger and communicating to others how to remedy situations.\n\nFabinho's role for Liverpool has become vital, and huge portions of play hinge on his input\n\nThe former Monaco man forms a water-tight base at the root of midfield, and allows his usual playing partners Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum to support the attack.\n\nSpurs could have the edge in dictating tempo, should they allocate record signing Tanguy NDombele the task of taking on Fabinho. The Frenchman was the sort of player Spurs were crying out for in the Champions League final, as Liverpool imposed themselves and took control of the tie.\n\nFurther up the field, Firmino is the axis upon which Mane and Mohamed Salah completely rely upon.\n\nIt's a huge ask, but if Spurs can nullify Fabinho while also taking Firmino out of the game, Liverpool will have some huge questions to answer.\n\nRoberto Firmino makes everything tick for Liverpool in the final third, and must be monitored\n\nFirmino's drifting into midfield to pick up the ball before feeding in one of his fellow assassins up front usually ends in one thing only. Goals.\n\nThis was also considered by United at Old Trafford last weekend, with the 28-year-old generally starved of service. At the one opportunity Firmino did get, when picked out in the area by Mane, he shot tamely at David De Gea.\n\nIf Spurs can limit him in a similar way, the advantage will quickly become apparent.\n\nPlay the game, not the occasion\n\nJust as they were inside Atletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano in June, the stands will be dominated in deep red on Sunday.\n\nSpurs must have their game face on from the off, completely casting the nightmare of Madrid from the mind.\n\nWhile this is a chance at redemption, and a shot at closure, they musn't dwell on that. It's easier said than done however it is paramount Pochettino's men play the game, not the occasion.\n\nSpurs must get Madrid out of the system and concentrate on silencing an intimidating Anfield\n\nThough they recently inflicted a mighty 5-0 defeat on Red Star in the Champions League, Spurs actually enter this fixture off the back of a disappointing draw to Watford. Before that, a dismal defeat to Brighton.\n\nThe men from north London need to take on Liverpool with nothing else in mind other than getting their season back on track with a positive result at Anfield.\n\nShould they quiver in the opening moments, replay Madrid in their minds and allow the noise of Anfield to fill their ears, Spurs will be fighting an uphill battle from the off.", "description": "Tottenham travel to Anfield on Sunday afternoon to face a foe they know all too well.
