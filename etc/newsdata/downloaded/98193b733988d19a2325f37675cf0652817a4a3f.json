Leavelle, the Dallas police detective wearing a white Stetson while handcuffed to Lee Harvey Oswald in one of the most dramatic news photographs ever taken, capturing the moment when the alleged assassin of President John F. Kennedy was fatally shot in 1963, died Aug. 29 at a hospital in Lakewood, Colo. He was 99.\n\nHis daughter Tanya Evers said he broken his hip earlier in the week while visiting another daughter in Colorado. He died of a heart attack after surgery.\n\nOn Nov. 24, 1963, two days after the Kennedy assassination, Mr. Leavelle (pronounced luh-VELL) was escorting Oswald through the basement of the Dallas police station, in preparation for a transfer to the county jail.\n\nMr. Leavelle was on Oswald\u2019s right, with his left wrist handcuffed to Oswald\u2019s right wrist. Oswald\u2019s hands were secured by a second pair of handcuffs. Another detective, L.C. Graves, was on Oswald\u2019s left, gripping his upper arm.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Lee, if anybody shoots at you, I hope they are as good a shot as you were,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Leavelle said in 2005, \u201cmeaning, of course, that they would hit him and not me. He kind of laughed and said, \u2018You\u2019re being melodramatic. Nobody is going to try and shoot at me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs they walked past a group of reporters and photographers, nightclub owner Jack Ruby stepped out of the crowd with a pistol and fired a single shot into Oswald\u2019s midsection.\n\n\n\nDallas detective Jim Leavelle, in white hat, as Jack Ruby shoots Lee Harvey Oswald on Nov. 24, 1963. (Bob Jackson/AP)\n\nIn a moment captured by Dallas Times Herald photographer Robert H. Jackson, Ruby\u2019s hand is extended, holding the gun, as Oswald grimaces in pain. Mr. Leavelle, wearing a light-colored suit, leans back, startled by the gunshot, looking directly into Ruby\u2019s face.\n\nMillions of people watched the shooting on live television, but Jackson\u2019s photo, which won the Pulitzer Prize, remains one of the most indelible images of the 20th century.\n\n[Jim Leavelle was attacked twice: at Pearl Harbor, then handcuffed to JFK\u2019s killer]\n\nMr. Leavelle, who had his left hand around Oswald\u2019s belt, saw Ruby approaching but was too late in jerking his prisoner out of the way.\n\n\u201cI tried to pull him behind me,\u201d Mr. Leavelle said in a 2002 oral history for the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, \u201cbut all I succeeded in doing was turning his body, so that instead of hitting him dead center, it hit him just about four inches to the left of the navel.\u201d\n\nAs Oswald collapsed, Mr. Leavelle used his free hand to grasp Ruby\u2019s left shoulder. Graves, the other detective, grabbed Ruby\u2019s right arm with one hand and placed his other hand over the cylinder of Ruby\u2019s .38-caliber revolver, preventing it from firing.\n\nWith cameras recording the chaotic scene, officers pounced on Ruby, placing him under arrest. Mr. Leavelle unlocked the handcuffs and stayed with the dying Oswald as he was put in an ambulance and taken to Parkland Hospital, where Kennedy had been pronounced dead two days earlier.\n\n\u201cI was holding onto his arm trying to get a pulse,\u201d Mr. Leavelle said in 2005. \u201cAbout halfway to Parkland he groaned and went limp.\u201d\n\nAt the hospital, Mr. Leavelle asked if the fatal bullet could be retrieved from Oswald\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cThey pinched the skin and the bullet just popped out in a tray, like a grape seed,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times in 2004.\n\nMr. Leavelle\u2019s involvement in the case began after Oswald was arrested at a movie theater in connection with the killing of a police officer, J.D. Tippitt. Oswald was captured 88 minutes after Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\nAt first, police did not link the two slayings, but Mr. Leavelle and other detectives became suspicious of Oswald\u2019s responses to their questions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t shoot anybody,\u201d Oswald said.\n\n\u201cMost suspects would say \u2018I didn\u2019t shoot that cop,\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t shoot that guy,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Leavelle told the Daily News. \u201cThen I got to thinking, well, he knew what happened, and he was getting his denial in early.\u201d\n\nOne day after Oswald\u2019s killing, Mr. Leavelle transported Ruby to the Dallas County Jail.\n\n\u201cThis time, we didn\u2019t alert the media,\u201d he said. Afraid he might be shot at, Ruby \u201ccrawled in the back seat on his hands and knees and got down on the floorboard. That\u2019s where he wanted to stay. I had my feet on his back as we drove to the jail.\u201d\n\nJames Robert Leavelle was born Aug. 23, 1920, in Bogota, Tex., and grew up on farms in northeastern Texas. After graduating from high school in Detroit, Tex., he joined the Navy. He was serving aboard the USS Whitney, a destroyer tender anchored about two miles from the principal targets of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.\n\nMr. Leavelle was not hurt in the attack but later suffered serious injuries in a shipboard accident. During his recuperation, he met a nurse, Taimi Trast, and they were married in October 1942.\n\nAfter the war, Mr. Leavelle held a series of odd jobs in California and Texas before joining the Dallas Police Department in 1950. He retired in 1976 and later ran a polygraph business and worked in security for banks. He lived in Garland, Tex.\n\nHis wife died in 2014. A son, James C. Leavelle, died in 2009. Survivors include two daughters, Tanya Evers of San Antonio and Karla Leavelle of Evergreen, Colo., and St. Petersburg, Fla.; three grandchildren; and a great-grandson.\n\nA granddaughter, filmmaker Kate Griendling, made a 2013 documentary, \u201cCapturing Oswald,\u201d featuring interviews with Mr. Leavelle and other police officers.\n\nHe had numerous close calls during his 26 years on the Dallas police force, but all were overshadowed by his connection to the Kennedy assassination. At Ruby\u2019s trial in 1964, he testified that he heard Ruby say after the shooting, \u201cI hope the son of a bitch dies.\u201d\n\nMr. Leavelle spent months investigating the Kennedy assassination and whether Oswald had any collaborators.\n\n\u201cWe never found anybody else connected with it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe believed Oswald acted alone out of a twisted sense of personal vainglory and had little patience with the myriad conspiracy theories that have sprung up in the wake of the assassination, including in Oliver Stone\u2019s 1991 film \u201cJFK,\u201d for which Mr. Leavelle was a technical adviser.\n\n\u201cThe only person they haven\u2019t accused yet of pulling the trigger has been Jackie Kennedy,\u201d he told the Dallas Morning News in 2002. \u201cIf you had asked me in \u201963, I would have said that all this would blow over by about \u201964. I\u2019m as amazed as anyone that 40 years later, there is still this interest.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons Mr. Leavelle\u2019s presence in the Oswald shooting was so memorable was that, alone of all the people gathered in the basement of the Dallas police building, he was wearing an off-white Stetson and light tan suit from Neiman Marcus. Both are now in the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas, along with the handcuffs he used with Oswald.\n\n\u201cOn my salary of $300 a month, I couldn\u2019t buy a Neiman Marcus suit,\u201d Mr. Leavelle told the Morning News. \u201cIt was given to me by a friend who had gained too much weight and couldn\u2019t wear it anymore . . . I owned three suits and I wore this one because it came up next in the rotation.\u201d", "description": "He was cuffed to Lee Harvey Oswald when the alleged presidential assassin was killed by Jack Ruby.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5qlMIo6d01IscQD7dyjpLNLIRGc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ERTVLZGLGMI6TIP6ZJDORVLTYA.jpg"}
