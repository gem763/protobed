REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nThe meeting will be Boris Johnson\u2019s first and last EU summit as prime minister of Britain if an agreement on his country\u2019s Oct. 31 divorce can be sealed with the other 27 member states and approved by parliament at a special session on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe basic foundations of this agreement are ready and theoretically we could accept a deal,\u201d said European Council President Donald Tusk, who will chair the summit.\n\nOfficials said that almost all of the differences between the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading bloc over their split had been resolved after marathon talks in Brussels.\n\nHowever, Johnson is struggling to win the parliamentary backing he needs from politicians dismayed by concessions made over how to treat the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nIf Johnson fails to win approval in London, he will almost certainly have to seek another delay of the departure date, more than three years after Britain voted in a referendum to leave.\n\nThe leaders will also contend at the summit with other challenges facing the EU, which has been torn in recent years by euroscepticism and economic disparities.\n\nThey will discuss the crisis in Syria touched off by Turkey\u2019s incursion against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces. Earlier this week, the bloc agreed to limit arms exports to Turkey over its offensive, but stopped short of a bloc-wide embargo against their NATO ally.\n\n\u201cThis is a deep, durable and multi-faceted crisis,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat, adding that there is serious concern among EU member states that the crisis will flush out foreign Islamic State militants who could come to Europe.\n\nTENSIONS OVER ENLARGEMENT\n\nDifferences over plans for the EU\u2019s first enlargement since 2013 will be exposed at the summit, with France determined that Albania and North Macedonia are not ready for membership talks.\n\nParis says challenges facing the EU - including Brexit, the emergence of China as a strategic rival and security threats posed by Russia - are already too extensive to admit two more states from a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult and political debate,\u201d said a second senior EU diplomat, describing it as an effort to find a balance between stabilizing the Balkans and risking the functioning of the bloc itself.\n\nAnother key issue will be the EU\u2019s budget for 2021-2027, called the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), with the biggest problem how to cover the shortfall when Britain leaves.\n\nMember states have yet to agree how much individual countries should contribute, a question made all the more difficult by proposals to end a system of rebates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a discussion that will end in consensus, but the first time that they will enter into the numbers game,\u201d said a third senior EU diplomat. \u201cThe positions are clear, but obviously there is division.\u201d\n\nThe summit will also be a chance for EU leaders to find common ground on climate targets ahead of a U.N. summit in Chile in December.\n\nThere is broad, though not unanimous, support for the EU to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, but there are differences among members over how much progress should be made by 2030. In 2018, the majority of EU states agreed on a 40% reduction, a goal some have criticized as not ambitious enough.", "description": "European Union leaders' two-day summit in Brussels starting on Thursday will be dominated by last-gasp efforts to seal a deal on Britain's exit from the bloc despite a raft of other pressing issues, from the crisis in the Middle East to the bloc's budget.", "authors": ["Marine", "Strauss", "Philip Blenkinsop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441656118&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F21U-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
