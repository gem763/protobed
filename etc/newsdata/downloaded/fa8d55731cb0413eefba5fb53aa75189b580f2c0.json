I was five.\n\n\u201cEither he has got massive memory loss and he genuinely thinks his dad hasn\u2019t seen him in concert or maybe he wants to believe that.\u201d\n\n(Image: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror)\n\nCarpenter Geoff reckons it is all part of his brother failing to accept responsibility for his life.\n\nStanley split with Elton\u2019s mum Sheila in 1962 and went on to have four more children with second wife Edna. First child Stan, now an accountant, was followed by Robert, who works for the Lottery operator Camelot.\n\nGeoff came next and finally Simon, who is now a civil engineer.\n\nAs the boys grew up, Elton became a glamorous uncle figure \u2013 but for large sections of his adult life, Elton rarely saw their father. And in the book, he recalls how Stanley snubbed his offer to help him when he was dying.\n\nHe writes: \u201cMy father had a heart problem and needed a quadruple bypass. I phoned and offered to pay for him to have the operation done privately. He flatly refused. It was a shame... but he didn\u2019t want my help.\u201d\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nBut Geoff hit back: \u201cDad was getting treated by the NHS and Elton offered him private treatment. But the NHS group knew my dad, they knew his conditions, what are you going to do? Just spend money on a private guy who he didn\u2019t know?\n\n\u201cThere are some things money can\u2019t buy. There was no agenda or malice from my dad, he was like \u2018Life isn\u2019t just about me, there are other people involved as well\u2019.\u201d\n\nElton also claims his dad never told him he was proud of him. And Geoff admits Stanley never told him he loved him until he was about to die \u2013 but insists it was down to his tough post-war upbringing.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for EJAF)\n\nHe said: \u201cI had this terrible comedown after a night out. I was thinking about my dad and thinking \u2018You weren\u2019t there for that, you didn\u2019t do that\u2019. My mind found every way to destroy him. Then my mind eased up. I thought, \u2018But then you have given me that strength.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for ourselves. I could turn round to Elton and say \u2018You\u2019ve actually had it really good\u2019. But if all you see is the negative, you are not seeing the positive.\n\n\u201cThe anger he feels towards his father and mother, I could allow myself to be the same but I wouldn\u2019t pin it on my parents. I would pin it on the culture out of which they came.\n\n\u201cHe is playing the blame card. But our parents came from war, where men had to be men and women had to be women. It\u2019s a different world.\u201d\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nWhen Stanley was on his deathbed in 1991, it was Geoff and his brothers who nursed him. Geoff said: \u201cMy dad... I can remember him saying \u2018I love you\u2019 but it was on his deathbed. There were four of us brothers there \u2013 Elton wasn\u2019t. When my dad was dying in hospital, he said, \u2018Take me home, I don\u2019t want to die here\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhen I took him home, I said, \u2018Dad, I love you\u2019. And he said, \u2018Yes, love is what it is all about\u2019. That\n\ngeneration just didn\u2019t express emotion in the same way we do now.\u201d\n\nElton\u2019s book is also critical of mother Sheila, who died aged 92 in 2017. Elton \u2013 played by Taron Egerton in this year\u2019s biopic Rocketman \u2013 claims she tried to ruin his 2014 wedding to David Furnish, \u00adwriting: \u201cOne of Mum\u2019s moods \u00adappeared to be upon us.\u201d\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nGeoff said: \u201cHe has bottled this up. Maybe she was the one person he could never upstage. Elton has been critical of my dad for a while. But now his mum is not around, she can\u2019t scare him into not saying anything.\u201d\n\nBut Geoff believes fatherhood has been the making of Elton, who is\n\nraising Elijah, six, and Zachary, eight, with David. He said: \u201cI think he needs children in his life.\u201d\n\nAnd Geoff\u2019s simple life is a far cry from Elton\u2019s, based in a remote cottage that has a huge board of star signs on the wall while a Hindu trident sits on the \u00adwindow ledge.\n\nHe recalls a time his van broke down near Elton\u2019s Windsor mansion \u2013 and he met David for the first and only time.\n\nHe said: \u201cDavid came along in a Bentley and wound down his window. He smiled and said, \u2018Jealous?\u2019. He drove off. It\u2019s the only time I met him. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. It really shocked me.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nGeoff, jailed at 18 over a botched burglary, says being Elton\u2019s brother was difficult at times. \u201cElton is a rock star who happens to be related to me. It is inescapable. In prison, I was hit by this fella who knew I was Elton\u2019s brother. He split my jaw.\u201d\n\nBut despite everything, Geoff insists he is proud of Elton \u2013 who was born Reginald Dwight. \u201cHe is a Dwight boy, of course I am proud of him. He\u2019s gone out and rocked it and fair play to him.\n\n\u201cMy dad was proud of him, you could see when Elton popped up on TV, his eyes lit up.\u201d\n\nBut as he gets ready to go foraging for mushrooms in the Welsh countryside, Geoff adds: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll read the book. I\u2019ve got a better read on now about Norwegian wood chopping.\u201d\n\nElton\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cElton stands by what he said in the book about his dad never seeing him perform. David has never spoken to or met Geoff, and the alleged incident did not happen.\u201d\n\nA rep for Elton said: \u201cElton stands by what he said in the book about his dad never seeing him perform as Elton John. David has never spoken to or met Geoff, and the alleged incident on the driveway did not happen.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Our dad was proud of the Rocketman but just didn't now how to say 'I love you'", "authors": ["Halina Watts", "Image", "John Gladwin Sunday Mirror", "Mirrorpix", "Getty Images For Ejaf", "Wireimage", "Corbis Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565818.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_23rd-Annual-Elton-John-AIDS-Foundation-Academy-Awards-Viewing-Party-Inside.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
