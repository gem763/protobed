Nor do they mind being woken up at 7 a.m. by the sound of their teammate tap-tapping his bat on the floor, because he\u2019s decided to practice in his hotel room. After a decade, they barely notice his habit of fidgeting like a murder suspect when he bats.\n\nBy now, Australia\u2019s cricketers know that Smith just needs to be left alone.\n\nBecause all of the tics, all of the compulsive behavior and eccentric techniques, are part of Smith\u2019s single-minded approach to the art of racking up runs. They have helped make him, without question, the most dangerous batsman in the game. For his obsessive skill and dedication to craft, he is the Mike Trout of Test cricket, the highest form of the game.\n\nBut even that doesn\u2019t do him justice. With the attention he brings to his craft, Smith is perhaps the most obsessive striker of a ball in any sport in the world.\n\n\u201cThis might sound odd,\u201d said Trent Woodhill, his on-and-off batting coach of 15 years, \u201cbut Steven loves batting more than anyone else.\u201d\n\nAnd more than anyone else, the 30-year-old Smith loves batting against England. His performances in the Ashes, the 137-year-old series between England and Australia, have prompted slews of articles in the British press wondering whether it was even possible to get Smith out. The answer: almost always no.\n\nThrough four matches in the 2019 Ashes, Smith has single-handedly scored 29% of Australia\u2019s runs, despite missing 1\u00bd of the matches with a concussion after taking a ball to the head. It turns out that that was more or less the only way to move him, because since the 2019 Ashes began, Smith has dug in to face 998 balls and batted for a combined 26 hours.\n\nIn baseball terms, that\u2019s the equivalent of around 250 at-bats. For Steve Smith, it was five innings.\n\n\u201cNot sure [England] know how to bowl to him,\u201d Australian great Shane Warne tweeted during one of Smith\u2019s demolitions.\n\nThrough four matches in the 2019 Ashes, Smith has single-handedly scored 29% of Australia\u2019s runs.

He only returned this summer from a one-year suspension from Test cricket for his part in a ball-tampering scheme involving Australian bowlers and a piece of sandpaper shoved down their pants. Smith, the team\u2019s captain at the time, accepted his ban in a tearful press conference that launched a thousand memes.\n\nPredictably, on his return to England in the first match of the Ashes, Smith was booed mercilessly. Predictably, he also notched a century.\n\nNow, with one more Test to play and Australia already guaranteed to retain the Ashes, his batting average is the third highest in series history, behind only Don Bradman (the Babe Ruth of cricket) and himself. Not that Smith has much time for record books.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the game for personal accolades,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m here to do my job and score as many runs for the team as I can.\u201d\n\nExcept no one has done his job in this sport quite the way Smith does. Like Stephen Curry or Ichiro Suzuki, Smith\u2019s technique is unique in the sport. Not for its particular beauty\u2014in fact, there\u2019s not much fun to be had actually watching Smith\u2014but for its unorthodoxy.\n\nBeyond his Rafa Nadal-esque routine of patting his pads, cup and helmet before every ball, Smith\u2019s stance sets him apart. Whereas batsmen are traditionally taught to stand just off the stumps and square to the bowler with their bat down, Smith holds his bat cocked and takes a risky step directly across the stumps to better whip his wrists around the ball. (And the taped shoelaces thing is to stop himself from staring at them.) It\u2019s enough to make cricket purists cringe.\n\nFor the men who shaped him in the game\u2014his father, Woodhill, and later an Australian coach named Michael Di Venuto\u2014there was never a question of tweaking his mechanics.\n\n\u201cI was more interested in the player than how the player should look,\u201d Woodhill said. \u201cI was around to protect his technique.\u201d\n\nBut his ungainly swing helps explain why Smith was never marked for otherworldly batting greatness in his early career. When he was first called up to the Australian national team, in 2010, it was as an all-rounder\u2014someone who could bat and bowl without necessarily specializing. His orders, he said, were to \u201ccome into the side and be fun.\u201d\n\nOne of Steve Smith\u2019s biggest strength is he never switches off. Photo: carl recine/Reuters\n\nIt took three years for him to become a one-man wrecking ball. Beginning in 2013, his numbers exploded. Only the suspension, followed by elbow surgery, slowed him down.\n\n\u201cThere were times throughout the last 15 months where I didn\u2019t know if I was ever going to play cricket again,\u201d Smith said during the Ashes. \u201cI lost a bit of love for it at one point, particularly when I had my elbow operation.\u201d\n\nOnce the brace came off his elbow, though, he snapped back. \u201cRight I\u2019m ready to go again,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is already the 2019 Test season\u2019s leading run-getter, even though his season started in August.\n\nThe closest comparison Woodhill could think of for Smith\u2019s relentless consistency was Mike Trout, another supremely gifted hitter obsessed with his craft. But even Trout doesn\u2019t seem as submerged by the moment as Smith. Between balls, Smith has a habit of re-enacting the shot he just made, almost as if to log it in his mind. Then, with a sweep of the arms, he pushes aside what he\u2019s just done and starts the fidgeting process again.\n\nSmith can do this for hours on end. Which is why he\u2019s at his most effective in Test cricket, the game\u2019s five-day format. He has time to outlast bowlers and carefully choose which balls to attack.\n\nAbove all, Smith never switches off. Last week in Manchester, windy conditions sent a beach ball rolling from the stands directly into Smith\u2019s path. With all the poise and focus of a man hard-wired to knock balls a long way away, he swept it toward the boundary as if it were a four-run shot.\n\nAnd obviously, he got it there.\n\nWrite to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "description": "Steve Smith\u2019s monstrous batting performances have guaranteed that Australia will retain the Ashes against England.", "authors": ["Joshua Robinson", "Joshua.Robinson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105103/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
