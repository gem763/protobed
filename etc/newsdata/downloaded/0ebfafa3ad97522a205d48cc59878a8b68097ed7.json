Baby Loss Awareness Week 2019 takes place from Wednesday 9 October to Tuesday 15 October. Each day, The Independent will be publishing a new story to shed light on people\u2019s experiences.\n\nWhen a loved one has experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth, it can be difficult to know what you can do to show your support in their time of need.\n\nEven if you are unable to directly relate to their distressing experience, it is important to make it clear you are there for them by remaining present in their lives and doing whatever you can to help them process their pain.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Some may take this as an indication that they should also keep their distance. However, saying or doing nothing at all can make grieving parents feel even more alone.\n\nKaren Burgess, CEO of baby loss counselling charity Petals, explains that stillbirth is the \u201cbig taboo in this whole area of work\u201d. \u201cI think people literally recoil from it,\u201d Karen says. \u201cSo you get these really strong, extreme reactions where people will literally walk away from someone because they can\u2019t bear to hear it.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, 37-year-old Alyx Elliott, director of strategy at Petals, experienced the stillbirth of her baby daughter, Skye, at 37 weeks, and suffered an early miscarriage a year later. Alyx, from Cambridge, says she felt \u201cshocked\u201d when some people in her life \u201cjust disappeared\u201d following the death of her first child.\n\n\u201cNothing. Silence. People who were incredibly close to us, just disappeared and still have,\u201d Alyx says. \u201cI\u2019m still lost to understand why, but I\u2019ve learnt since that it\u2019s quite common. And that\u2019s sort of a wound on top of everything else.\u201d\n\nThe disappearance of people in her life led Alyx to automatically question whether they thought she was at fault in some way. \u201cWhen you\u2019re this vulnerable the thoughts automatically go to, \u2018It\u2019s me, and it\u2019s because my baby died inside my body and they can\u2019t bear to look at me.\u2019 That was really eye-opening for me and it\u2019s really shaped the relationships I have with people now in my life.\u201d\n\nDo: Just listen\n\nBeing there for someone who has experienced a miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal loss doesn\u2019t have to mean instinctively knowing the right words to say, because there is no one right phrase that is applicable for all. Demonstrating your willingness to listen can relay to grieving parents that you are willing to be there for them and hear about their baby, says Nicola Rash.\n\nNicola, a 33-year-old lab manager from Suffolk, has experienced two miscarriages. The first, a missed miscarriage, occurred on the same day that Meghan Markle announced her pregnancy during Baby Loss Awareness Week in October 2018, and the second occurred at the end of March this year. Nicola explains how friends who she wasn\u2019t close to at the time offered her kindness by empathising with her and listening.\n\n\u201cThey told me about their own miscarriages, or their own losses, and were just there for me. And that was all I needed really, someone to say, \u2018I understand\u2019, and listen. And not to try and minimise it, because a lot of people try to minimise your pain. Just people coming forward to listen to you, and being there,\u201d Nicola says.\n\nRuth Bender-Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, outlines how listening to those in pain can enable friends and family to better understand the support their loved ones need. \u201cThe most important thing to do is simply to say something like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to hear your news,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u2019 and then to listen. Because you\u2019ll know from the response in which direction to go,\u201d Ruth states.\n\nDon't: Worry about feeling uncomfortable\n\nDespite the increased awareness of miscarriage in recent years, pregnancy and baby loss are topics that many people still find uncomfortable speaking about openly. This level of discomfort may be the reason that some people draw themselves away from friends or family when they learn of their losses, rather than understanding that just because something is painful, that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be spoken about.\n\nYou can\u2019t get enough talking about your child, whether they\u2019re living or dead\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about stepping into their own discomfort and their own fears about feeling this and being able to put themselves in the shoes of the person who has experienced it,\u201d Karen states. \u201cThat will mean going towards rather than pulling away from them.\u201d\n\nOne of the comments Alyx received from people who expressed their condolences following the death of her daughter Skye was along the lines of, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through,\u201d a statement she took offence to. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018You can actually, but you just don\u2019t want to because it\u2019s so awful,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t want people to know what it\u2019s like, but please at least imagine it for a few seconds, just put yourself in my shoes. It\u2019s the people that did do that and did go there, even if it was just for a few seconds, who said the right things.\u201d\n\nDon't say: \"Don't worry you'll have another baby\"\n\nOften when a person hears bad news, they may automatically try to find a silver lining in the sadness, a way of making the individual who is in pain feel better. However, parents say that the devastation of losing a baby is not something that can be softened with an optimistic statement.\n\nWhen paediatric nurse Alice (32) and IT professional Dave Bailey\u2019s (32) daughter Vera was stillborn at 38 weeks in 2016, they received comments such as: \u201cDon\u2019t worry you\u2019ll have another baby\u201d, and \u201cThere was probably something wrong with her.\u201d \u201cI remember one person saying, \u2018You just need to get back to your normal life and then it\u2019ll all be fixed,\u201d Alice says.\n\nKatie Ingram, whose baby daughter Ottilie Eve Ingram was stillborn at full term in April, outlines how those who are trying to offer grieving parents support \u201ccan fall into the easy trap of telling someone how they can or should feel\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur desperation to make someone feel better often results in, \u2018You mustn\u2019t think that,' or, \u2018Don\u2019t do that to yourself,\u2019 but it isn\u2019t that helpful,\u201d Katie says. \u201cIf someone has exposed their raw feelings to you, then listening and understanding is more supportive than trying to correct them. Grief isn\u2019t a rational process.\u201d\n\nDo: Ask questions\n\nIf you are unsure how to begin a conversation with someone who has experienced pregnancy or baby loss, then asking them what they would like to tell you about their baby or how they would like them to be referred could make them feel comfortable opening up to you about their child. \u201cYou can\u2019t get enough talking about your child, whether they\u2019re living or dead,\u201d Alyx says.\n\nIt is important to follow the lead of the parents, Alyx explains, rather than make assumptions about what statements you believe may be comforting.\n\n\u201cI think people really just need to be led by the parents and the language that they use. Because it\u2019s not for everybody,\u201d she states. \u201cSome people who\u2019ve had a miscarriage may not want to refer to it as their baby. Some people will have named their baby, and other people won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAsk them, \u2018How would you like me to talk about your baby?\u2019 I think I\u2019ve maybe been asked that once, and I would have loved it if everybody had asked me that, because then I could have just been like, \u2018I\u2019d love it if you said her name.\u2019 Because every time I hear her name it\u2019s like music in my ears.\u201d\n\nAlice adds that people \u201cshouldn\u2019t be afraid\u201d to ask questions about a baby who has passed away.\n\n\u201cAsk them about them. Ask them what they looked like. Ask them how the birth was. Ask them how you came up with the name,\u201d she says. \u201cJust like you would if the baby was ok, you would ask how much they weighed, or what colour their hair was. No one ever asked us that.\u201d\n\nKate Holmes, support and information manager at The Lullaby Trust, adds that many families \u201cfind comfort in saying their child\u2019s name and sharing memories of the time they had together\u201d.\n\n\u201cTalk freely about the special qualities of the child and do not avoid mentioning the subject,\u201d Kate says.\n\nDo: Think carefully about your choice of words\n\nIn addition to following the parents\u2019 lead when talking about their baby, it is essential that you are vigilant about the language you use. While certain phrases may seem like they are comforting, they may in fact be the exact opposite.\n\nEvery time I hear her name it\u2019s like music in my ears\n\nNicola says one of the phrases that was voiced to her frequently following her miscarriages was: \u201cNext time just try and relax, and then it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think well, it\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Nicola says. \u201cI found that one really frustrating, that implied blame that somehow it\u2019s always the mother\u2019s fault. That if you just didn\u2019t stress so much, or if you worked less, then it wouldn\u2019t happen. But of course it still happens.\u201d\n\nFor Alyx, the terminology some people have used to refer to her daughter has been a cause of great upset.\n\n\u201cWe have to use the terms miscarriage and stillbirth to refer to these things, but I have had a few occasions when people have actually referred to Skye as \u2018the stillbirth\u2019, as in \u2018the stillborn\u2019, rather than my baby,\u201d she says.\n\nDo: Continue to show support\n\nWhen a parent experiences pregnancy or baby loss, the mental impact of the trauma can be overlooked if they are seen returning to work or going about their everyday routine as they did before. However, just because they may seem as though they are coping doesn\u2019t mean that they should not still be receiving support from their loved ones.\n\nFollowing the death of their daughter Vera, Alice and Dave underwent counselling sessions with Petals. Their regular counselling sessions led some to believe that they had \u201cmoved on\u201d, as did the subsequent birth of their son.\n\n\u201cWhen we had our son afterwards, people kind of thought alright now, they\u2019re fixed,\u201d Alice says.\n\nAlyx says that while the majority of people sent her a sympathy card and said nice things to her and her husband Jonny, \u201cthat was it for a very long time\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about them constantly,\u201d Alyx adds.\n\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, you can contact stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands on 0808 164 3332 or email helpline@sands.org.uk.
