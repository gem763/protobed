REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe departure of Kerkhoff, who is set to be replaced on an interim basis by Supervisory Board Chairwoman Martina Merz, adds to the turmoil at the industrial conglomerate, which is struggling to cope with falling steel prices, a weak car market and a declining German economy.\n\nThe company has been trying to restructure itself by selling or listing all or parts of its elevators unit, its most profitable business, in a bid to rake in cash to fund pension liabilities and a turnaround of its other units.\n\nBut progress has been slow and the implementation of the strategy failed to create momentum, a supervisory board source told Reuters. \u201cThat\u2019s why Thyssenkrupp\u2019s key owners had to hit the \u201cemergency brake\u201d,\u201d the person said.\n\nShares in the group fell 0.8% in early trade.\n\nThe overhaul at the top comes after mounting scepticism over Kerkhoff\u2019s ability to turn around the group, with shares having fallen 40% since he took over as CEO in July 2018, hitting their lowest levels since 2003 last month.\n\nLars Foerberg, founding partner of Thyssenkrupp\u2019s second-largest shareholder, Cevian, said he fully supported the appointment of Merz.\n\n\u201cWe expect that the new leadership will speed up the transformation process that Thyssenkrupp so urgently needs, and improve the quality of implementation. We are confident that Thyssenkrupp will now finally get a crystal clear strategy and a well-defined plan of action,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this year the group admitted that some of its units would be better off under different owners and that the company needed to improve margins.\n\n\u201cThe realignment of the group announced in May 2019 and unanimously approved by the supervisory board will be systematically continued. The focus will be on the three areas \u2018performance first\u2019, \u2018flexible portfolio\u2019 and \u2018efficient organization\u2019,\u201d Thyssenkrupp said in a statement.\n\nUnder Kerkhoff\u2019s tenure, Thyssenkrupp cut its earnings forecast four times, dropped out of Germany\u2019s benchmark stock index and scrapped plans to spin off its capital goods business and efforts form a joint venture with Tata Steel (TISC.NS).\n\nThyssenkrupp did not elaborate on the decision, but said it would propose Merz, a former Bosch manager, as interim CEO for no longer than a year. She would be replaced by board member Siegfried Russwurm as chairman on an interim basis.\n\nRelated Coverage Top shareholder Cevian backs new Thyssenkrupp CEO Merz\n\nThe company said it would also recommend that Klaus Keysberg, head of the group\u2019s Materials Services business area, join its management board.\n\nThe supervisory board will decide on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting shortly, the company said.\n\nKerkhoff, who joined Thyssenkrupp as finance chief in 2011, took over as CEO last year following tumultuous weeks during which the conglomerate\u2019s former CEO and chairman departed due to mounting investor pressure over strategic issues.", "description": "Thyssenkrupp is preparing to replace its chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, whose brief tenure at the German submarines-to-car-parts group included four profit warnings and two failed restructuring efforts.", "authors": ["Christoph Steitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433670848&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0H1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
