It is still unclear what caused the fire.\n\nThe boat's captain and four crew members escaped the wreckage by jumping on to a small boat. Authorities believe there are no other survivors.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency investigating the incident, described in a media briefing on Thursday the \"harrowing story of the moments before the fire erupted.\"\n\nAccording to NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy, investigators have been interviewing the survivors to try and understand what transpired.\n\nOne crew member told the NTSB that he awoke to noise from the galley area below where he was sleeping, and left his bunk to investigate. He discovered flames erupting from the area, which was above the guest's sleeping quarters.\n\nHomendy said the ship's galley houses the kitchen, stove area, wiring and electrical systems, and gear charging stations, all of which could potentially have caught fire.\n\nCrew members say they tried to get down a ladder to the guest's quarters, but could not get through because of the flames.\n\nThey then attempted to get to the main deck via the bridge of the ship, with one crew member breaking their leg in the process.\n\nRead more: A boat was engulfed in flames off the California coast, claiming at least 20 lives.

Two other crew members were rescued and taken to a nearby vessel before they called for help.\n\n\"At that point, they left the vessel and returned back to the Conception in the skiff to try and rescue any survivors,\" Homendy said.\n\nDid the crew make the right choices?\n\nCalifornia boat fire More", "description": "Investigators have interviewed the surviving crew members and are trying to piece together whether the right safety measures were taken.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.j2AL4f8D_83Ry9uU9IqlQ--~B/aD02MDA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/58ac96124ea31a368117da50a1dff315", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
