I thought I had a good chance of winning, but I had been a judge myself and know the decision can hang on a word. It\u2019s a long evening, and so much depends on it. I was keyed-up but calm, prepared to win or lose. I\u2019d had plenty of practice at losing and keeping a smile on my face.\n\nWhen the announcement came, everything happened very fast. Within a blink I had made my speech (prepared, of course) and was being interviewed live on stage, surrounded by technicians trying to get a line to America. I couldn\u2019t hear America\u2019s questions, and the broadcasters were upset and showed it. Down in the body of the hall, all my folk were hugging each other, but I was surrounded by sweating strangers shouting at me. I felt lonelier than I ever had in my life, sealed off as if behind a screen of glass.\n\nThen I pulled out my useless earphones, stepped down into the melee, and all the rest began: three days of incessant talking. Sometimes I feel I\u2019ve been talking ever since. But the prize was very good for me. It boosted my confidence as a writer and gave me financial security after some bad years. I said I\u2019d spend the money on sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. I can\u2019t disclose too much, but ask yourself why I needed to win again three years later\u2026", "description": "Wolf Hall was published in April 2009, and as the year advanced, the wind filled its sails.", "authors": ["Hilary Mantel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/books/2019/10/09/GettyImages-91505121-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjZCqkh21MTy1LvXE-PcUNQgWqwm85JEWpGVhFb46TTg.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
