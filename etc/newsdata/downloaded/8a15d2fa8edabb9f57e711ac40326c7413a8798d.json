But jobs risk being displaced, people's privacy risks being exposed and inequality may be perpetuated by AI being fed biased data, with cities at various stages of readiness for the new future.\n\nIn determining how prepared global cities are for this disrupted future, New York-based research outfit Oliver Wyman Forum's inaugural Global Cities AI Disruption Index, released on Thursday (Sept 26), scored cities on 31 metrics across four broad categories: vision, activation ability, asset base and growth trajectory.\n\nSingapore received the best overall score of 75.8, bolstered by its strong performance in the vision category, which measures the presence of plans to respond to technology changes and plans to upgrade labour skills and infrastructure such as mobile networks.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nSingapore also did well in the asset base category, which assesses the amount of intellectual property, labour productivity, tech talent, venture capital investments and the education level of the population, among other things.\n\n\"Singapore stands out for its vision; it has a whole-of-government view on how AI is to be deployed across the society and has a high-level steering committee for this,\" said Mr Jacob Hook, managing partner of management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, which owns the research outfit.\n\nIt is one of the few governments in the world to have developed an AI governance framework to address ethical dilemmas, he added. Singapore's framework to promote the ethical use of AI was released at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January this year.\n\nOther recent developments that worked in Singapore's favour include its data protection laws and cybersecurity strategies to maximise the impact of digital technologies on the economy.\n\nThe other cities in the top 10 on the index are London (75.6), New York (72.7), San Francisco (71.9), Paris (71.0), Stockholm (70.4), Amsterdam (68.6), Boston (68.5), Berlin (67.3), and Sydney (67.3).\n\nChina cities, known for the widespread roll-out of AI technologies, did not appear in the overall top 10, pulled down by relatively lower scores in most of the categories.\n\nBut Chinese cities Shenzhen, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Hangzhou scored the highest in the growth trajectory category, which measures how fast technology infrastructures evolve, city administration effectiveness and the size of venture capital investment.\n\nFor one, gait and facial recognition technologies are already in use by law enforcement in Beijing and Shanghai to help identify individuals even when their faces are obscured.\n\nMeanwhile, Shenzhen is home to telecommunications equipment giant Huawei, which is leading the world in 5G technology developments, and Hangzhou is home to global e-commerce titan Alibaba.\n\nAlibaba's AI-powered technology is also automating traffic management in Hangzhou such as turning traffic lights in favour of ambulances.\n\nThe difference in their privacy mindset creates a strong runway for Chinese cities to deploy AI, giving them a stronger growth trajectory, said Mr Hook.\n\nTHE STRAITS TIMES", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [SINGAPORE] Singapore is the most prepared for the next wave of technology disruption that will be brought about by artificial intelligence (AI), according to a new index on AI readiness that ranks 105 global cities. .
