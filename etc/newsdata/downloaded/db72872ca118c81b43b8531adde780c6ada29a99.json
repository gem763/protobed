Well, this is good news: John Crowe Ransom finally gets not one but two variorum editions of his work: \u201cMany readers will wonder whether Ransom is a poet worth troubling over, these decades after his death, the great movement in American poetry and literary criticism he helped to incite having been, by and large, routed in the academy and in the broader culture. The answer is, yes, indeed.\u201d\n\nAlso good news, I think: Flannery O\u2019Connor documentary receives $200,000 grant: \u201cA new film about the life and writings of Flannery O\u2019Connor will receive the first Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film. The award was announced on Wednesday by the Better Angels Society, the Library of Congress and the Crimson Lion/Lavine Family Foundation.\u201d\n\nJim Antle reviews Rand Paul\u2019s The Case Against Socialism: \u201cMuch of Paul\u2019s book is devoted to pointing out that when socialism is taken to its most radical conclusions, it degenerates into starvation and death camps, not playing cute AOC videos on your iPhone or wearing a Che Guevara t-shirt on your college campus.\u201d\n\n2018 saw a big jump in the number of self-published books according to Bowker\u2019s annual survey: \u201cIn its report, \u2018Self-Publishing in the United States, 2013-2018: Print and E-books,\u2019 the total number of print and e-books that were self-published in 2018 was 1.68 million, up from 1.19 million in 2017. Bowker measures the size of the market based on the number ISBN\u2019s registered and thus does not include self-published e-books by Amazon\u2019s Kindle division, which uses an Amazon identifier.\u201d\n\nWhy red means red in almost every language: \u201cWhen Paul Kay, then an anthropology graduate student at Harvard University, arrived in Tahiti in 1959 to study island life, he expected to have a hard time learning the local words for colors. His field had long espoused a theory called linguistic relativity, which held that language shapes perception. Color was the \u2018parade example,\u2019 Kay says. His professors and textbooks taught that people could only recognize a color as categorically distinct from others if they had a word for it. If you knew only three color words, a rainbow would have only three stripes. Blue wouldn\u2019t stand out as blue if you couldn\u2019t name it. What\u2019s more, according to the relativist view, color categories were arbitrary. The spectrum of color has no intrinsic organization. Scientists had no reason to suspect that cultures divvied it up in similar ways. To an English speaker like Kay, the category \u2018red\u2019 might include shades ranging from deep wine to light ruby. But to Tahitians, maybe \u2018red\u2019 also included shades that Kay would call \u2018orange\u2019 or \u2018purple.\u2019 Or maybe Tahitians chunked colors not by a combination of hue, lightness and saturation, as Americans do, but by material qualities, like texture or sheen. To his surprise, however, Kay found it easy to understand colors in Tahitian. The language had fewer color terms than English. For example, only one word, ninamu, translated to both green and blue (now known as grue). But most Tahitian colors mapped astonishingly well to categories that Kay already knew intuitively, including white, black, red, and yellow. It was strange, he thought, that the groupings weren\u2019t more random.\u201d\n\nBanksy opens online store, and it is predictably sardonic in that belabored way that characterizes most of Banksy\u2019s work.

As he described it in one poem, he was \u2018[a]way in the loveable west, / On a pastoral forehead of Wales.\u2019 It was here at St. Beuno\u2019s, a few days after writing \u2018The Starlight Night,\u2019 that Hopkins delivered his earliest extant sermon.\n\n\u201cIf the setting for the sermon was a friendly one, so was the audience. The attendees were Hopkins\u2019s Jesuit brothers, the aim of the sermon being to gain him practice before his first assignment as a parish priest. The stakes, in other words, were low.\n\n\u201cHopkins, however, was not one for halfhearted pursuits. He had no intention of taking it easy on himself. He opened with a grand metaphor, one designed to make his hearers reflect on the act of hearing. \u2018Lend me your ears,\u2019 he said, and then presented an image of the Sea of Galilee as \u2018a man\u2019s left ear.\u2019 The River Jordan, he began, \u2018enters at the top of the upper rim [and] runs out at the end of the lobe.\u2019 The city of Bethsaida Julias rests, he said, \u2018above the ear in the hair.\u2019 He described the Apostles Peter, Andrew, and Philip as coming from \u2018against the cheek where the bow of the ear ends.\u2019 The city of Tiberias he situated \u2018on the tongue of flesh that stands out from the cheek.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd on he goes. And on. And on. As though the image were not complex enough, he fancifully transposed the ear/map composite onto the Welsh landscape surrounding St. Beuno\u2019s. He connected Holy Land locations with Welsh places like Rhuddlan and Llannefydd, and finally he made the spot where his listeners sat on the slope of Maenefa, the very site where the biblical story they were about to hear took place.\n\n\u201cA metaphor bringing together the Holy Land, Wales, and an ear is a surprising feat of the imagination \u2014 and a playful one, too. But there is no reason to think Hopkins did not also mean for it to inspire. Surprise, in fact, is integral to his strategy. He wants to collapse time and space, to thrust his reader into the scene, making the Gospel story a vivid, felt reality. This much is certain: Hopkins missed his mark. Hearing their left ears compared to the Sea of Galilee, his listeners did not sit in silent amazement. They guffawed. And as Hopkins disentangled himself from his baroque opening metaphor, he encountered fresh difficulties.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Chiru in a snow-covered desert\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
