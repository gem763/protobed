It was Neumann\u2019s charisma, conviction, and unfettered ambition\u2014he has spoken about WeWork Mars, running for president of the world, and becoming the first trillionaire\u2014that built WeWork into one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups, with operations spanning 111 cities in 29 countries.\n\nThen, in August, WeWork filed for an initial public offering, and in doing so exposed a raft of curious and troubling details about the inner workings of the company, which rebranded earlier this year as The We Company, or We.\n\nSome, like the $900 million WeWork lost in the first half of 2019 and the outsized control co-founder Neumann wielded, were par for the course for a buzzy private technology company these days. Others, like rampant self-dealing\u2014Neumann owned several properties he leased back to the company, received personal loans and a credit line secured by his WeWork stock, and sold the trademark to \u201cWe\u201d to the company for $5.9 million when it rebranded\u2014shocked even jaded startup observers.\n\nFurther reporting revealed Neumann\u2019s very un-CEO-like conduct: how he smoked marijuana on a transatlantic private jet flight, handed out trays of tequila shots after mass layoffs, and made impulsive, sweeping decisions like a company-wide ban on meat with little to no rationale.\n\nLast week, WeWork shelved its IPO after reports that the company\u2019s valuation could fall as low as $10 billion, a dramatic plunge from its last private valuation of $47 billion. But the final blow came today, when WeWork said Neumann was stepping down as CEO, effective immediately. Neumann will stay on as non-executive chairman of the board, while two top internal executives\u2014Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham\u2014become co-CEOs.\n\n\u201cWhile our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\u201d Neumann said in a statement.\n\nNeumann has lost more than a title. The Wall Street Journal reported that he is also ceding majority control of the company, with his voting power slashed to 3 votes per share, down from 10. (His voting rights were previously reduced to 10 votes per share from 20 in WeWork\u2019s initial IPO filing.) He has lost the backing of Softbank, WeWork\u2019s biggest cheerleader and investor, which began calling for his ouster over the weekend. He may even have lost a $500 million line of credit, provided by the banks underwriting WeWork\u2019s IPO and secured by his own shares.\n\nTravis 2.0\n\nThe stunning rise and fall of Neumann echoes the trajectory of Travis Kalanick, the brash co-founder of Uber who built a multibillion-dollar company and then was pushed out by his board in 2017, amid multiple sexual harassment scandals and federal probes into the company\u2019s conduct. Once the full extent of mismanagement at Uber and WeWork became clear, investors and the public were quick to turn against both Kalanick and Neumann. But before it all came out\u2014the scandals, the self-dealing, the wildly inappropriate conduct\u2014those same investors embraced the co-founders for their vision and audacity.\n\nArrogance, ambition, a blatant disregard for the rules, and fondness for \u201cpissing people off\u201d cost Kalanick his job. It also made Uber great. Boldness, grandiosity, zeal, and ambition bordering on megalomania convinced many people to invest in Neumann\u2019s WeWork, and also, eventually, that he had to be removed from it.\n\nVenture capitalists, the gatekeepers to success in Silicon Valley, often talk about investing in people not ideas. In recent years, as financing has flowed to a select group of startups in ever-bigger rounds at ever-greater valuations, the cult of the founder has grown as well. More power, more money, more unshakeable certainty in their own right to total control over their company. WeWork is the logical endpoint of this: Silicon Valley\u2019s great unicorn bubble. Neumann\u2019s wildest ambitions found a fellow traveler at Softbank, whose enigmatic CEO Masayoshi Son showered him with cash and told him to make WeWork \u201cten times bigger than your original plan.\u201d (Yes, WeWork is based in New York and not technically part of Silicon Valley\u2014but its rise directly follows a Silicon Valley playbook and involves many of the same principal actors.)\n\nStory continues", "description": "The stunning rise and fall of the WeWork co-founder echoes the\u00a0trajectory of Travis Kalanick, the brash co-founder of Uber who was also pushed out by his board.", "authors": ["Alison Griswold"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JcbnRdG4PgeM_JDhwc7V6A--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/12befaf4619535e6e9f00d17cf0f9ae0", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
