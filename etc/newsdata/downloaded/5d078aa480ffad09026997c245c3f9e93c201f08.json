He also did not vote for Trump in 2016\n\nThe Austrian-born American citizen said he 'could' vote for progressive Elizabeth Warren\n\n'I would just have to see what her program is, what her vision is for the future of America, because I think the most important thing is we keep America No. 1,' Schwarzenegger, who was born in Austria, added of the progressive 2020 contender.\n\nIt's questionable why the life-long Republican would support such a far-left candidate just because he doesn't agree with the views of the Republican incumbent. It would be far more likely for a never-Trumper to opt for more moderate Democratic candidates like Joe Biden.\n\nWarren, however, has been climbing the ladder lately \u2013 even beating out Biden for the No. 1 spot among likely Democratic primary voters in some polls.\n\n'He and I used to be friends,' Schwarzenegger told Stern of his relationship with Trump, adding that the then-businessman supported his 2003 gubernatorial run.\n\nUltimately, the climate activist said, 'I couldn't really go with him because of his philosophy about the environment and some of the other issues.'\n\n'I told [Trump] before the election in 2016, I said, 'Look, I would love to endorse you, but I can't because I worked too hard on environmental issues and you tried to bring coal back. This is like bringing Blockbusters back.''\n\nSchwarzenegger, 72, has been highly critical of the president, and didn't vote for Trump in the last presidential elections either.\n\nTrump and Schwarzenegger used to be friends, but have sparred several times on social media in the past few years. The president went after the actor for his brief, low-ratings period hosting 'The Celebrity Apprentice' \u2013 which Trump previously hosted\n\n'For the first time since I became a citizen in 1983, I will not vote for the Republican candidate for president,' Schwarzenegger posted in an October 2016 statement on his Twitter.\n\n'But as proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else \u2013 American,' Schwarzenegger said in the statement at the time. 'So I want to take a moment today to remind my fellow Republicans that it is not only acceptable to choose your country over your party \u2013 it is your duty.'\n\nIn the 2016 Republican primary race, Schwarzenegger said he voted for then-Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nTrump and Schwarzenegger have repeatedly quarreled on Twitter, with Trump lambasting the 'Terminator' star for his brief, low-ratings period of hosting 'The Celebrity Apprentice' \u2013 which Trump previously hosted.\n\n'He's in love with me,' Schwarzenegger reasoned of Trump's attacks in a Men's Health interview last month.\n\nSchwarzenegger's most recent film, 'Terminator: Dark Fate,' is set to release in theaters November 1.", "description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger said Monday that for the second time ever since becoming an American citizen, he will vote Democrat in the 2020 presidential election.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495016-0-image-a-2_1570630731674.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
