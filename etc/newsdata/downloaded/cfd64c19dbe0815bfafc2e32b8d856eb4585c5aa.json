That\u2019s the reality of it. With Trump, he wants to be me.\u2019 Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nThat\u2019s Arnold Schwarzenegger, in an interview with Men\u2019s Health, talking about how his relationship with the president has evolved over the years.\n\n\u201cI remember that in the old days, when we went to the wrestling matches, the way he admired people with bodies, and the way they would jump around in the ring, and to perform physical stunts and stuff like that \u2014 he had great admiration for that,\u201d the movie star and former governor of California said, adding that Trump was also fascinated with how Schwarzenegger managed to navigate stardom.\n\nBut those were happier times for the duo, before Schwarzenegger\u2019s short-lived stint as the replacement host on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nOf course, it was Trump\u2019s Twitter finger that started it all:\n\nYes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017\n\nSchwarzenegger returned fire:\n\nAnd just this past weekend, Schwarzenegger hit Trump over his rollback of environmental protections, writing in an op-ed for the Washington Post that, \u201cTrump can\u2019t erase a decade of clean-air progress with a Sharpie.\u201d\n\nClearly, Schwarzenegger, a U.S. citizen since 1983, isn\u2019t shy about discussing the president\u2019s shortcomings. Still, he remains an optimist about the country.\n\n\u201cPeople everywhere, no matter how much they dump on America, no matter how much people laugh at Trump right now all over the world \u2014 they want to come to America,\u201d he explained in the Men\u2019s Health interview. \u201cBecause they know that one president, one man, cannot change this country.\u201d\n\nFrom the MarketWatch archives (2015): Donald Trump\u2019s replacement on \u2018Celebrity Apprentice\u2019 is Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nAnd (2017): Trump slams Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u2018Apprentice\u2019 departure: \u2018He was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings\u2019", "description": "The former governor, in an interview with Men\u2019s Health, talks about how his rock relationship with the president.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR027_arnold_ZG_20190910142202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
