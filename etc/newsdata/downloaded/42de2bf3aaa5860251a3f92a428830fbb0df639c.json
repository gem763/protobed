'Anthony [Martial] has been out for eight weeks now. So he's had to play loads more football than I'd hoped.\n\n'Marcus is a centre forward who can play left, right and as a No 10. He wants to be able to play all the positions.\n\n'I want him to be facing the goal, I want to be direct and attacking quickly, so at the moment I see him coming in off the left or as part of a two up front.'\n\nThe 21-year-old has found it tough to carry the weight of expectation to provide all the goals\n\nSpeaking to Gary Neville (left) before Sunday's game against Liverpool, Solskjaer opened up\n\nMARCUS RASHFORD 2019-20 CLUB STATS Games: 10 Minutes: 803 Goals: 3 Assists: 2\n\nMartial's absence seems to have particularly impacted Rashford's game, with the weight of expectation proving to be too much as United have struggled with the Frenchman out injured.\n\nRashford has scored just once from open play for United this season - three in total, with penalties against Chelsea and Leicester City - but did get a goal for England in the 6-0 rout of Bulgaria.\n\nA return for Martial could see Rashford return to a wide role on the left, where he appears to be more comfortable, and while he will not be allowed to sit the game out, it may revitalise him after his goal in the international break.\n\nSolskjaer knows at just 21, Rashford is still developing his game, and only because he arrived with a bang under Louis van Gaal as a teenager has expectation soared.\n\n'Marcus' movement is great, but maybe we just need to give him a game or two of rest because he's played a lot,' Solskjaer added.\n\nAnthony Martial has helped ease pressure on Rashford and the pair have a strong relationship\n\nMartial plays as the side's No 9 due to his clinical finishing and he is set to return on Sunday\n\n'Sometimes, because he's a young boy with lots of expectations on his shoulders, he's played four or five seasons now, and yet he's still not even 22 yet.\n\n'He's a scorer of great goals, as he did for England. I want him to become a great goalscorer - and that's a different mentality. At the moment, he's learning his trade.'\n\nUnited are slumped in 12th after the opening eight matches and know that defeat to rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford would see an 18-point gap open up between the two sides.", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has admitted that he 'can't really give Marcus Rashford a break' due to Manchester United's limited options in attack but accepts the forward is worn out right now.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/09/19826852-0-image-a-4_1571300742558.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
