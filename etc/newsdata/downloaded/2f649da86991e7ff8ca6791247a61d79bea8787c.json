They decided it was the right time to move on and focus that show online \u2013 and also, in TV terms, to keep the whole focus on the main show.\n\n\" BGT \u2019s younger audience have a huge appetite for consuming content via digital platforms - clips of the show now reach millions of people so it\u2019s a no brainer for producers to make this move.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"The decision was nothing to do with Stephen, he is the heart and soul of BGMT and a much-loved member of the BGT family \u2013 and everyone loved him on the show. And he is, of course, still incredibly busy with lots of exciting projects for ITV.\"\n\nA BGT spokesperson said: \"As our 18-34 audience share continues to grow and viewing habits are changing, naturally we are listening to our viewers and focusing more on digital platforms in support of the main show.\"\n\nThis weekend saw dance duo Twist and Pulse crowned winners of Britain's Got Talent: The Champions.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnd the lads - Ashley Glazebrook and Glen Murphy - admitted it had been very difficult to hide their victory after they were pictured with the trophy.\n\nThey had their picture taken with the coveted trophy outside Wembley Arena, and they battled to keep the snap from doing rounds on social media.\n\nSince then, Ashley and Glen have dedicated a huge amount of time deleting fans' tweets of the photo so they didn't spoil the show for others.\n\n(Image: Tom Dymond)\n\nAshley revealed to The Mirror : \"It's one of those things when you've got that many people in the crowd.\n\n\"Some people uploaded videos of it and screenshots, it's so hard. We used to just perform and leave the building and that's it and hope it didn't come out.\"\n\nHe added: \"We wanted to keep it so fans could experience the show the way it's meant to be done rather than spoiling it because it takes the fun out of it.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
