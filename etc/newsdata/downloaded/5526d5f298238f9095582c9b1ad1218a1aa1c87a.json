But even his lawyers say a victory for him would likely have more value for others. Malvo also received six life sentences for Maryland murders, and he could be prosecuted in other states.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was one of the biggest skeptics.\n\n\u201cSo, if he can demonstrate, as a result of good behavior in prison, for example, that he has been rehabilitated, then he must be released?\u201d asked Alito.\n\n\u201cNo. No, absolutely not,\u201d said Washington lawyer Danielle Spinelli. She said that even with new hearings, \u201cthere are occasions when juvenile offenders are resentenced to life without parole. Even if he were given parole eligibility, that would not mean that he would be released.\u201d\n\nBeyond Malvo, the case could signal an expansion \u2014 or a retreat \u2014 from the court\u2019s rulings that say even the most violent juvenile offenders must be treated differently. But those rulings came in cases where Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the court\u2019s liberals.\n\nAD\n\nKennedy retired last year and has been replaced by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, and it appeared from questioning in the hour-long oral argument that Kavanaugh will play a decisive role in the outcome.\n\nAD\n\nVirginia Solicitor General Toby J. Heytens argued that Malvo was not entitled to a new hearing. The Supreme Court\u2019s precedents, he said, were founded on the notion that mandatory life without parole for juvenile offenders violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Supreme Court has found the commonwealth\u2019s law is not mandatory.\n\nBut the court\u2019s liberals found that finding questionable. The jury that convicted Malvo for the murder of Linda Franklin outside a Home Depot store in Fairfax County was deciding between recommending life without parole and the death penalty, which in 2004 had not been ruled out for juveniles.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe jury had only two choices, death or life without parole,\u201d said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cAnd nobody seemed to have appreciated at the time of Malvo\u2019s convictions that there was any discretion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe asked whether any Virginia judge ever reduced the life sentence for a juvenile. Heytens said he did not know of any.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor also pressed about a judge\u2019s discretion. \u201cThat really is the nub of this case,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan wrote the majority opinion in Miller v. Alabama that said mandatory life sentences without parole were prohibited for juvenile offenders. She told Heytens that it required more than a determination of whether the sentence was mandatory.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 30-page opinion, and it can be summarized in two words, which is that \u2018youth matters,\u2019 and that you have to consider youth in making these sorts of sentencing determinations,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cOf course, it talks a lot about mandatory schemes because a mandatory scheme was in front of it, but the entire reasoning was about how much youth matters and how a judge or a jury, whoever the sentencer is, has to take that youth into account.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKavanaugh said one way to look at the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents is that \u201cyou can\u2019t impose life without parole on someone who\u2019s merely immature as opposed to incorrigible.\u201d And if that\u2019s the rule, he asked, is it enough that a state has a discretionary sentencing scheme, or must the sentencer indicate in some way that question has been considered?\n\nJustice Department lawyer Eric J. Feigin said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which ruled for Malvo, was wrong when it said a discretionary scheme was not enough. It is, Feigin said, although the department believed the case should be remanded for another look at whether that accurately characterizes Virginia\u2019s law.\n\nAD\n\nSpinelli reminded the court that Malvo\u2019s sentencing took place before any of the court\u2019s relevant rulings on juvenile offenders. She said Virginia\u2019s laws were not discretionary, but that \u201cthe theoretical opportunity to consider youth, when it wasn\u2019t actually considered, simply can\u2019t be squared with the language of\u201d the court\u2019s more recent precedents.\n\nAD\n\nKavanaugh pointed out the precedents don\u2019t require a finding of fact, only consideration. And it is presumed that judges consider the factors that are required.\n\nSpinelli said: \u201cBut this is not a case where the judge was required to consider anything. And, in fact, she did not consider imposing any lesser sentence than life without parole.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlito and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch pushed Spinelli on whether the court\u2019s precedents were as broad as she read them; both seemed to say it was enough to find that a sentencing scheme was discretionary.\n\nSpinelli resisted. \u201cThe question is whether the juvenile committed the crimes based on transient immaturity or permanent incorrigibility,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what we are asking for is a hearing in Virginia court where the Virginia sentencer will make that determination.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere is no dispute that Muhammad met Malvo when the boy was an abandoned 14-year-old in Antigua. He brought him to this country, trained him as a sniper and enrolled him in a bizarre terror scheme.\n\nAD\n\nThey shot at least 22 people around the country, killing 14 of them, including the 10 homicides in the Washington area. Muhammad was executed in Virginia in 2009.\n\nSince the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings, advocacy groups say about 1,950 inmates have received new hearings or relief from new laws. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have now prohibited life sentences without parole for juveniles.\n\nMalvo, now 34, is one of 12 people sentenced as juveniles and serving life in Virginia.\n\nTom Jackman contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Attorneys for Lee Boyd Malvo, whose 2002 shooting spree terrorized the Washington region, argue he deserves resentencing because his age was not considered when he was sent to prison for life.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M_qWyhIriX9LQpa9n7isXhKABhw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HGQRTPXQLUI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
