Surprisingly, yes", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s an interesting question that\u2019s generated a lot of debate lately. Is there really any such thing as a formal \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d and can it be initiated by way of the Speaker of the House holding a press conference? Keith E. Whittington at Lawfare digs into the matter and comes up with a surprisingly simple answer. As it turns out, the Constitution says almost nothing about it and without any firm guidelines, the House can do pretty much whatever it wants when it comes to impeachment.\n\nIs it constitutionally acceptable for the House speaker to initiate an impeachment \u201cby means of nothing more than a press conference\u201d? In short, yes. The constitutional text on this issue is spare. The Constitution simply says that the House has the sole power of impeachment. Ultimately, if the House wants to impeach someone, it needs to muster a simple majority in support of articles of impeachment that can be presented to the Senate. How the House gets there is entirely up to the chamber itself to determine. There is no constitutional requirement that the House take two successful votes on impeachment, one to authorize some kind of inquiry and one to ratify whatever emerges from that inquiry. An impeachment inquiry is not \u201cinvalid\u201d because there has been no vote to formally launch it, and any eventual impeachment would not be \u201cinvalid\u201d because the process that led to it did not feature a floor vote authorizing a specific inquiry.\n\nSo the bottom line appears to be that there\u2019s really no formal definition of anything called an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d in the Constitution or anywhere in federal law. But the House, having the \u201csole power of impeachment\u201d regularly holds hearings and inquiries on all manner of subjects, so impeachment could be something they inquire into. In other words, there\u2019s no such thing as an impeachment inquiry unless the House majority decides there is.\n\nThat\u2019s not a terribly satisfactory answer, but it\u2019s about as close as we\u2019re going to get. Of course, that doesn\u2019t answer the underlying question as to whether or not there are grounds for an actual impeachment vote, but again, there are no rules to this game. Impeachment is a unique feature in our Constitution and it exists outside of normal judicial proceedings. Congress makes up the rules as they go until it comes to an actual vote.\n\nJust as the old saying informs us that \u201cyou can indict a ham sandwich\u201d if you want to, the House can attempt to impeach a president, a Supreme Court justice or any other eligible official for any reason they like. There doesn\u2019t even have to have been evidence of a law being broken, what with the whole High Crimes and Misdemeanors thing. And it\u2019s looking more and more like the Democrats have painted themselves into a corner and will have to move forward with a vote to impeach Donald Trump for the High Crime of taking part in a phone call with another world leader.\n\nOn a related note, the most recent poll from Scott Rasmussen finds that 51% of Democrats now believe that it\u2019s either somewhat likely or very likely that Donald Trump will be removed from office. 27% of independents and 20% of Republicans agree.\n\nBefore anyone, including the President, loses too much sleep over this, we should keep one thing in mind. None of this Ukraine insanity appears to have shifted the playing field significantly in terms of Trump\u2019s GOP support in the Senate. They might get a couple of Senators, maybe Collins and Romney for example, to vote against Trump, but that still leaves them miles short of 67 votes. I\u2019m guessing the Democrats want to stretch out this \u201cinquiry\u201d as long as possible to keep the media talking about it nonstop and embed the image into the minds of the public. And so far the cable news networks have been more than happy to comply.", "description": "It's as clear as mud", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PelosiShrug.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
