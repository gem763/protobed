When made especially for you by magnificent wielders of knitting needles, a nostalgic and sentimental rush of knowing you are loved by somebody with some serious skills.\n\nSweater weather, as it has been dubbed (and ruined by this song, and mocked by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d), marks all these things as much as it does the changing of our food habit to soothe seasonal colds and moods as well as abate the chilling of fingertips and noses.\n\nWe\u2019ve pulled our best recipes for sweater season. Get ready to get cozy.\n\nTim\u2019s Macaroni and Cheese, above. Can you talk about comforting without mac and cheese? Maybe you can, but we can\u2019t. This version has a whole lot of cheese, plus a smoky backbone of roasted Anaheim peppers for a slight kick. There are also 10 (ten!) cloves of garlic, which don\u2019t end up tasting like too much. If you can\u2019t find Anaheims, feel free to substitute poblanos. If you\u2019re craving mac and cheese but have gone meatless, this Green Chile Mac will do the trick.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick/The Washington Post)\n\nCreamy Tomato Soup With Popcorn. Classic tomato soup gets a slightly lighter \u2014 and fresher \u2014 twist here. With all the creamy textures you love but less sugar and salt, you can sip as much as you want. A handful of fresh popcorn on top makes for a fun textural addition you\u2019ve probably never thought of and will absolutely repeat.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nNew-Style Polish Hunter\u2019s Stew (Bigos Revisited). Bigos is a hearty, meaty Polish soup that should be on your fall/winter recipe roster. This version, via the hit show \u201cQueer Eye\u2019s\u201d cooking expert, Antoni Porowski, adds a splash of red wine for a little French twist.\n\n\n\n(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nNot-Quite Matzoh Ball Soup. No, it\u2019s not quite matzoh ball soup, but it is gluten-free and deliciously similar to the classic.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nKale and Mushroom Lasagna. If you\u2019re bracing for a moody Monday, then let Garfield guide you to a lasagna. Specifically, this vegetable-packed and ultra-cheesy number.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nCheesy Chicken Enchiladas. This warm dish doesn\u2019t get lost in the sauce, though you just might! Fill with beans instead of chicken to make it vegetarian.\n\n\n\n(Photos by Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick/The Washington Post)\n\nVegetarian Mapo Tofu. Some of us find solace in super-spicy dishes, so satisfy that craving at home with this totally plant-based mapo tofu.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nKabocha Squash and Peanut Stew. It\u2019s always gratifying to break down a squash, and even more so to pair it with warming spices in this creamy vegan stew.\n\n\n\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nCinnamon Challah French Toast. Get cozy at breakfast with this gorgeous French toast. You can serve a crowd with these decadent slices that, with their cinnamon sugar top, verge into brulee territory.\n\n\n\n(Photos by Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nTriple Hot Chocolate. The best hot drink gets even better with triple the chocolate! Top with marshmallows if desired \u2014 or, better yet, turn to our homemade Peppermint Marshmallows.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nThink beyond pie with these 6 spectacular apple dessert recipes\n\nA new survey about American breakfast preferences is stuck in the past\n\n10 autumnal cocktail recipes for a cozy night-in or holiday cheer", "description": "We want recipes that are as warming and soft as our favorite sweater.", "authors": ["Kari Sonde", "Editorial Aide For Food", "October At Pm", "Kari Sonde Is The Editorial Aide For The Food Section", "Where She Helps With Recipes", "Cooking Questions", "Food Styling.
