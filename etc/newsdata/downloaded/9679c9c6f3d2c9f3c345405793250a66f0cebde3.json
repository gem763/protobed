Maxine Waters: Trump 'setting some of us up to be killed'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Maxine Waters said Wednesday that President Trump\u2019s verbal attacks are putting Democrats in danger and that she\u2019s had to hire round-the-clock security due to death threats.\n\nThe California Democrat told MSNBC that she can\u2019t go to public places like the grocery store without a security guard due to threats she\u2019s received since the president\u2019s been in office.\n\n\u201cHe is setting some of us up to be killed. I have death threats constantly. There are a number of people who have been convicted for threatening to kill me,\u201d Ms. Waters said. \u201cI can\u2019t go to the grocery store anymore by myself. I have to pay for security all the time. I can\u2019t move around the country without security.\u201d\n\nMs. Waters\u2018 complaints were mocked by conservatives on social media who pointed out that the congresswoman just last year encouraged her supporters to harass Trump administration officials in public.\n\nHer comments came one day after she said impeachment was \u201cnot good enough\u201d for Mr. Trump and that he needed to be imprisoned and \u201cplaced in solitary confinement\u201d over his controversial July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump has previously attacked Ms. Waters as an \u201cextrordinarily low IQ person.\u201d\n\nLife comes at you fast\u2026\n\n\n\nJust months after @RepMaxineWaters instructed her fans to harass anyone serving in the Trump admin. wherever they are seen, (\u201cdepartment store, gas station, restaurant\u2026\u201d) she complains on @MSNBC that she can\u2019t go to the grocery store without security. pic.twitter.com/xRghSecGGU \u2014 The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) October 3, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
