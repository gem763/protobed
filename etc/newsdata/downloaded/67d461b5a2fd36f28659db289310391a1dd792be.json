LOUIS \u2014 A Missouri man was executed Tuesday for killing a man during a violent 1996 crime spree, despite concerns that the inmate\u2019s rare medical condition would cause a gruesome lethal injection.\n\nRussell Bucklew was executed at the state prison in Bonne Terre. It was Missouri\u2019s first execution since January 2017.\n\nBucklew had twice previously been within hours of execution, only to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant last-minute reprieves over concerns that he might suffer during the execution process. He had a condition called cavernous hemangioma and had blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. He breathed with help from a tracheostomy tube.\n\nBucklew\u2019s attorneys said in a clemency request to Gov. Mike Parson that a throat tumor could burst, causing Bucklew to choke and die painfully and in violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nBucklew looked around and twitched his feet beneath the sheet as he lay on the gurney just before the lethal injection. He suddenly took a deep breath and all movement stopped.\n\nThere were no outward signs of distress.\n\nAdding to the concern was Missouri\u2019s secretive execution drug. The state uses a single dose of pentobarbital but refuses to say where it gets it. The source is believed to be a compound pharmacy since large pharmaceutical companies prohibit the use of their drugs in executions.\n\nThe Supreme Court stepped in to halt Bucklew\u2019s execution in 2014 and again in 2018. But in April, the high court gave the go-ahead for Bucklew to be executed.\n\nHuman rights groups and death penalty opponents, including all four Roman Catholic bishops in Missouri and the American Civil Liberties Union, urged Parson to grant clemency and remand Bucklew to life in prison without parole. The ACLU and Missourians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty presented the governor\u2019s office on Thursday with petitions that they said included more than 57,000 signatures.\n\nBut Parson, a Republican who worked in law enforcement for more than 20 years and a staunch death penalty supporter, decided early Tuesday that the execution could proceed.\n\nInmates\u2019 medical conditions have affected other recent execution attempts.\n\nIn 2017, the execution of twice-convicted killer Alva Campbell, who suffered from smoking-related breathing problems, had to be halted in Ohio when a usable vein couldn\u2019t be found to administer execution drugs. He died in 2018 at age 69.\n\nIn 2018, Alabama halted the lethal injection of Doyle Lee Hamm when the execution team had trouble getting the intravenous line connected. Hamm had damaged veins because of lymphoma, hepatitis and drug use. A doctor hired by Hamm\u2019s lawyers wrote in a report that Hamm had at least 11 puncture sites and bled heavily from his groin during the attempts to connect the line.\n\nBucklew\u2019s girlfriend, Stephanie Ray, left him on Valentine\u2019s Day 1996. Over the next few weeks, according to court records, he harassed her, cut her with a knife and punched her in the face.\n\nRay feared for her life and the lives of her children, so she moved into the Cape Girardeau County mobile home that her new boyfriend, Michael Sanders, shared with his children.\n\nOn March 21, after stealing his nephew\u2019s car and taking two pistols, handcuffs and duct tape from his brother, Bucklew followed Ray to Sanders\u2019 home. Sanders confronted Bucklew with a shotgun inside the home. Bucklew fired two shots, one piercing Sanders\u2019 lung. He bled to death.\n\nBucklew then shot at Sanders\u2019 6-year-old son and missed. Court records say he struck Ray in the face with the pistol, handcuffed her and dragged her to his car. He later raped Ray before heading north on Interstate 55.\n\nA trooper spotted Bucklew\u2019s car and eventually became engaged in a gunfight near St. Louis. Both men were wounded. Bucklew later escaped from the Cape Girardeau County Jail. He attacked Ray\u2019s mother and her boyfriend with a hammer before being recaptured.\n\nBucklew\u2019s attorneys, Cheryl Pilate and Jeremy Weis, said in a statement that Bucklew was remorseful for his crimes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Russell Bucklew has been executed for killing a man during a violent 1996 crime spree, despite concerns that the inmate's rare medical condition would cause a gruesome lethal injection.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Salter"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/03/18/missouri_execution_12185_c0-113-2560-1605_s1770x1032.jpg?c606acce904439a6eacc735edb97e34154690b72", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
