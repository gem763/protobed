This is in light of the increase in strike pay which has given UAW GM workers new energy to keep on striking GM until workers get a fair contract,\" the source said.\n\nThe striking workers plan to distribute leaflets at the dealerships, as well.\n\nThe UAW board voted on Saturday to bump up workers' strike pay by $25 a week and allow them to take part-time jobs and still qualify for the benefit.\n\nStarting on Sunday, workers who perform picket duty will get $275 a week in strike pay. Strike pay was $250 a week and was already set to rise to $275 in 2020.\n\nThe UAW lashed out at GM on Friday, accusing it of undermining its good-faith efforts to end the strike.\n\n\"The company's strategy from day one has been to play games at the expense of the workers,\" the UAW said in a statement out Friday. \"It has released half-truths, ripped away health care in the middle of the night and it reverted to previously weak and unacceptable proposals in response to the UAW\u2019s comprehensive solutions.\"\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % GM GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY 35.57 +0.91 +2.63%\n\nThe harsh language comes after GM sent a letter earlier Friday to its employees, updating them on its new offer to the UAW.\n\nThe automaker said that on Oct. 7 it presented an updated offer to the UAW, which would increase compensation and preserve health care benefits without raising out-of-pocket expenses. The offer also gives workers enhanced profit-sharing with unlimited upside and improves their ratification bonus. Temporary workers would also receive a clear path to permanent employment.\n\nFOX Business' inquiry to GM was not returned at the time of publication. UAW declined to comment.\n\nFOX Business' Jonathan Garber contributed to this report.", "description": "The striking workers plan to distribute leaflets at the dealerships, as well.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19282829188705.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
