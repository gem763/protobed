(Photo: Pamela Dorman Books)\n\nThe thwack of a book striking a man\u2019s head, the crack of a gunshot and an escape on horseback signal the stellar start to Jojo Moyes\u2019 new book, \u201cThe Giver of Stars\u201d (Pamela Dorma Books/Viking, 400 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four stars).\n\nRather than the story of a single romance, as in her best-selling 2012 hit \u201cMe Before You,\u201d \u201cGiver\u201d is a love story of an unlikely group of women who defy society\u2019s norms to deliver library books to people in the mountains of Kentucky during the Great Depression, a real-life program launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nMargery O\u2019Hare is the fearless leader of the Horseback Librarians of Kentucky. She reaches out for more women willing to saddle up horses to serve people whose circumstances won\u2019t allow them to make it to town for books. First to volunteer is Alice Van Cleve, the newlywed British wife of Bennett Van Cleve, whose father owns the local mining company. Alice fled a dull life in Britain into handsome Bennett\u2019s arms. But life with Bennett proves even duller; he shows little interest in his wife, either in or outside the marital bed.\n\nMore: 'Pursuit' another creepy, suspenseful thriller from prolific master Joyce Carol Oates\n\nAlice flings herself into delivering books as a way to avoid home and her deeply disapproving father-in-law. Moyes\u2019 descriptions of the women\u2019s travels to impoverished families are affectionate and so vivid, you can practically smell the smoke curling from chimneys.\n\nMargery is a moonshiner\u2019s daughter, the child of an abusive home and a woman of few words but great warmth toward the people of the hollows \u2013 and the local mine\u2019s fire chief, Sven Gustavsson.\n\nMoyes\u2019 new book illustrates why she is a two-time winner of Romance Novel of the Year Award from the Romance Novelists\u2019 Association. The yearning devotion Sven has for marriage-averse Margery despite her attempts to keep him at bay, and the slow-burning passion between Alice and the man who owns the library building, are heart-rending and real.\n\nThe librarians risk community outrage as early proponents of sex education by delivering a book to women who ask about marital intimacy. Yet Moyes is coy about two characters who could be gay; maybe that\u2019s a topic for another novel.\n\nAuthor Jojo Moyes.

When one of the librarians is brutally beaten, Margery says the worst thing about being hit by a man is \u201cthat it don\u2019t matter how smart you are, how much better at arguing, how much better than them, period. It\u2019s when you realize they can always shut you up with a fist.\u201d Until, she says, you learn to fight back.\n\n\u201cThe Giver of Stars\u201d is a richly rewarding exploration of the depths of friendship, good men willing to stand up to bad and adult love. Moyes celebrates the power of reading in a terrific book that only reinforces that message.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/07/giver-stars-jojo-moyes-book-review-historical-fiction/3882254002/", "description": "An unlikely group of women defy society's norms to deliver library books during the Great Depression in Jojo Moyes' stellar \"The Giver of Stars.\"", "authors": ["Patty Rhule", "Special To Usa Today", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Vince Flynn", "Kyle Mills", "Rick Riordan", "Demi Moore", "Bill O'Reilly", "Published A.M.
