There\u2019s low-budget footage out there on the internet of the protagonist facing obstacles and reaching climax (not the movie\u2019s).\n\nAnd if you went to watch Joker, then you might have had a gander online to see what the porn world has to offer in the way of lovable villains.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone, you clown fetishist (or Joaquin Phoneix stan).

Margot Robbie\u2019s rendition of Harley Quinn stole the show.\n\nIn fact, Pornhub revealed that the colorful gymnast reigns supreme when it comes to comic book porn favourites.\n\nEven after two years, Harley Quinn is still the most popular movie or game character on Pornhub with over 10 million searches in 2018 alone.\n\nThat number\u2019s probably only going to increase given the latest edition of the franchise, Birds of Prey, is set to drop in 2020.\n\nWe\u2019ve added the trailer below to those who can\u2019t get enough of the villainous badass known as Joker\u2019s girlfriend.\n\nBut no jerking off to it though.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMORE: Children as young as 7 are seeing porn online, survey shows\n\nMORE: International Talk Like a Pirate Day is making horny people search for pirate porn\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "In the first four days of Arthur Fleck's reintroduction to the world, there were more than 741,000 searches on Pornhub involving 'Joker'.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90111701_1571216199.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
