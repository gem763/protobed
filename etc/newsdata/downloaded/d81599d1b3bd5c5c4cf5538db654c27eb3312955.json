Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she\u2019s taken than about how this plan is going to be funded.\u201d\n\nSeveral polls showed support dropping or plateauing for Medicare for All throughout the summer. Those shifts in public opinion came amid Democratic debates that spent significant time on the issue, and a well-funded opposition campaign launched by the health care industry.\n\nThe declining support creates a challenge for Warren, who gambled on not devising her own health care plan, like other candidates, but instead telling voters \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d on Medicare for All.\n\nThe overall plan, authored by Sen.

I think it\u2019s a possibility that people hearing more of that discussion and hearing more of those arguments could be leading to a softening in support,\u201d said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research for KFF.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArguments from Republicans and moderate Democrats that Medicare for All would increase taxes for the middle class and eliminate private health insurance appear to be breaking through with voters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said at Tuesday\u2019s debate, addressing Warren.\n\nSupport for Medicare for All typically declines when voters are told it would end private insurance. Sanders\u2019s proposal would ban the sale of private insurance plans that cover the same services as the new national health care plan.\n\nWarren and Sanders argue that private insurance companies profit by denying care to their customers, driving up health care costs for millions of Americans.\n\nBut Warren sidestepped questions Tuesday, as she did in previous debates, about whether Medicare for All would lead to tax increases for the middle class. She argues overall costs would go down for middle class families because Medicare for All would do away with the deductibles, copays and premiums associated with private insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, industry groups such as the Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future, a coalition of doctors, hospitals and insurers opposed to Medicare for All, are spending millions of dollars on ads attacking the proposal in early voting states like Iowa. The group has also aired ads before, during and after some of the debates.\n\n\u201cI do think it has had an impact on public opinion. But what\u2019s interesting is how much money it\u2019s taking to try to sow doubt in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Rep.

Fifty-six percent in April said they supported it.\n\nThat support mainly comes from Democrats and independents, but it\u2019s dropping among both groups: 71 percent of Democrats and 51 percent of independents said they supported Medicare for All in October, compared with 77 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independents who said the same last month.\n\nStill, support for Medicare for All varies depending on how questions are asked in polls.\n\nA CBS poll released Tuesday, and conducted in late September and early October, showed 66 percent favored a Medicare-like \u201cnational, government-administered plan\u201d that would \u201ccover all individuals.\u201d\n\nOnly 32 percent said they thought a national health insurance system would work better if it replaced private insurance.\n\nBut a Morning Consult poll conducted June 29 to July 1 showed that 46 percent of voters surveyed said they supported Medicare for All if it \u201cdiminished\u201d the role of private insurers.\n\nWhen asked if they would support a Medicare for All plan that diminished the role of private insurers but allowed patients to keep their \u201cpreferred doctor and hospital,\u201d support shot up to 55 percent.\n\n\u201cIt really depends on how you word it and frame it,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a leading Democratic pollster. \u201cIf you talk about Medicare for All in the positive \u2014 that there is no copay, you get to choose your own doctor and everyone is covered, that is very positive with voters.\n\n\u201cIf you talk about it doing away with insurance, raising taxes \u2026 then of course it\u2019s unpopular.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
