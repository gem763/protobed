He's a great loss for us.'\n\nMatic captained United for the first time in their unconvincing 1-0 Europa League group stage home win over Astana on September 19.\n\nMatic will find familiar company should he sign for Inter, who bought Romelu Lukaku in August\n\nChile forward Alexis Sanchez also moved to Inter from United in August on a season-long loan\n\n'To be the captain of Manchester United is something special, of course, and brings a lot of responsibility,' he said after leading an inexperienced team to a late victory.\n\n'I hope that it is not the last time - as I said, it's a big responsibility and I'm proud of that.\n\n'There are a lot of young guys in the team. After Sergio Romero, I think I was the oldest, which was strange - but this is life.'", "description": "The Serbia stalwart has been out of favour since the appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on a permanent basis in March, making just three Premier League appearances so far this season.", "authors": ["Ben Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/17/19630112-0-image-a-13_1570897041312.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
