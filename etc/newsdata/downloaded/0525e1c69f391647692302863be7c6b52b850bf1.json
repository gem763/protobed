I just can't point to the planet yet and tell you which one it is,\" says NASA exoplanet scientist Steve Howell.\n\nWhat's next? Scientists need new tools in order to know if they've found a world truly like our own.\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), expected to launch in 2021, might be able to investigate the atmospheres of small planets, though it's likely best suited for dissecting the atmospheres of larger, gaseous planets.\n\nIt will probably take until the generation of telescopes after JWST to enable scientists to find a truly habitable exoplanet.\n\nThe Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor is a NASA concept for a space-based observatory that could directly image a small planet's atmosphere for the first time.\n\nWhile the public and other researchers might be impatient to find another Earth, exoplanet scientists are in it for the long haul.", "description": "Some of the most convincing evidence that a planet is Earth-like may come if scientists can detect atmospheric water vapor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/d-gUtzFJCWl5UY3h8EbH5MGtGMI=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/05/07/1557249137148.gif", "published_at": "2019-05-07"}
