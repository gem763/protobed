Have something to say? Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost.\n\nIf anyone was questioning whether or not Aethero was the real deal \u2026 \u2013 @HarrisonBurt5\n\nJohn Moore was smiling like the Cheshire Cat in the aftermath of Aethero\u2019s stunning victory at Sha Tin on Saturday.\n\nNot only did the boom three-year-old justify all the hype with a track-record breaking performance and lower the colours of the highly rated Voyage Warrior, the legendary trainer filled his pockets in the process.\n\nMoore is not known as a big punter, but he couldn\u2019t resist the odds on offer for his rising star Aethero at Sha Tin on Saturday.\n\nNo doubt Aethero and Voyage Warrior were the two stand-outs in what shaped as the race of the season so far and while opinions were divided, the price discrepancy was surprising.\n\nA dash of history!\n\n\n\nAethero dips inside the great Sacred Kingdom's course record set in 2007 (54.70s), scorching the track in 54.69s for John Moore and Joao Moreira. #HKracing pic.twitter.com/XjqELuA0eq \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 12, 2019\n\nVoyage Warrior jumped at $1.70 with Aethero going around at $4.35 and Moore couldn\u2019t believe his luck, insisting to his wife Fifi that they needed to invest heavily.\n\n\u201cI told Fifi to open the safe,\u201d Moore joked afterwards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often I have a bet with my own money. It was a crazy price. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had a win this big.\u201d\n\nBut the reality is the giant smile afterwards wasn\u2019t about the cash (although that is always nice) \u2013 it was about Moore putting his neck on the line and being proven right.\n\nThe 69-year-old has been spruiking the ability of Aethero for a while now \u2013 \u201che has all the makings of a superstar\u201d \u2013 but was left a little flat after everything went wrong first-up.\n\nComing out on top against a horse who also harbours Group One expectations the very next start is worth plenty \u2013 which is perhaps a good lesson for those fans of Voyage Warrior, it was only one run, things didn\u2019t pan out and he can bounce back.\n\nBut crucially for Moore, Aethero\u2019s devastating victory ensured he got a big ratings boost (up 13 points to 102) and secured a spot in next month\u2019s Group Two Jockey Club Sprint and after that (hopefully) the Group One Longines Hong Kong Sprint.\n\nIt\u2019s even more important when considering this will be Moore\u2019s last Hong Kong International Races as he is being forced into retirement.\n\nBut now it looks like he will enter the showcase meeting with not only the best horse in Hong Kong in Beauty Generation, but also the most promising young sprinter in town.\n\nNo wonder Moore was beaming.\n\nHe\u2019s back. Allied Agility gets his second win from five starts \u2013 @NickyWongMM\n\nWhen the HK$3.7 billion Conghua racecourse was officially opened last year, one of the big selling points was the 1,000m uphill gallop to provide trainers with another tool to get the best out of their horses.\n\nIt is an 1,100m chute above the back straight \u2013 the first of its kind available to Hong Kong-based horses \u2013 and was meant to mimic the iconic uphill gallops in jurisdictions like Japan and Britain. The problem is it hasn\u2019t really caught on yet.\n\nSome handlers with stables at Conghua are reluctant to use it \u2013 the thought being the 100m pull-up area is not long enough \u2013 but others are beginning to experiment with it more and more.\n\nRicky Yiu Poon-fai is one who has been testing it out and it paid dividends at Sha Tin on Saturday when Allied Agility prevailed in the second race.\n\nAfter winning his first start down the Sha Tin straight, the gelding struggled in his following three runs, with Yiu making the decision to send him to Conghua.\n\nThe trainer galloped Allied Agility twice uphill during his three-week stint in the mainland \u2013 they were his two most serious pieces of work \u2013 before returning to Hong Kong for Saturday\u2019s contest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only slow work but it\u2019s something different for them \u2013 sometimes they need a change. It makes them use their hindquarters a bit more,\u201d Yiu said. \u201cAllied Agility, since he\u2019s been to Conghua he\u2019s a more relaxed horse than before.\u201d\n\nGiven the type of horses who come to Hong Kong and the fact trainers are still working out the best way to use the Conghua facilities, it is unlikely we will see a legion of world-class stayers coming through like those who march up and down similar hills in Japan and Britain.\n\nBut the uphill gallop certainly looks to have helped a Class Four sprinter rediscover his best form and it is a small win that could encourage more to take advantage of the underutilised track.", "description": "Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing.
