With his unique look, memorable voice, and knack for witty dialogue with a devastating delivery, Shawn\u2019s performances in films like My Dinner With Andre, The Princess Bride, and Clueless \u2014 not to mention his efforts as a voice actor in the Toy Story franchise \u2014 have made an indelible impression on the pop-culture landscape.\n\nIn addition to writing for the theater and his big-screen performances, Shawn has made a career of popping up for an episode or two on just about every TV series you can think of. Recently, however, he\u2019s had a gig on CBS\u2019s Young Sheldon that\u2019s provided him with something he hasn\u2019t had in a long time: a recurring role. Shawn plays Dr. John Sturgis, a physics professor who, over the course of the series\u2019 run to date, has become romantically entangled with Sheldon\u2019s beloved Meemaw, played by Annie Potts.\n\nShawn spoke with Vulture about having a rare long-term gig, his appreciation of his young co-star, and his uncertainty about what the future holds for him and Ms. Potts on the series, but he also took time to reflect on the weirdness of being approached by fans when you don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re a fan of, and why he hasn\u2019t owned a TV in over 40 years.\n\nYou\u2019ve had plenty of TV roles over the years, but you haven\u2019t really had a substantial recurring role like on Young Sheldon in a long while.\n\nNo, I\u2019ve never done anything like this. There was a TV series of Clueless shortly after the film came out, and I did that for about a year. But I\u2019ve done this for many more episodes, I think. By now I must have filmed, I don\u2019t know, 18 or 19 episodes of Young Sheldon? So I don\u2019t particularly want to know why they invited me. For me, it\u2019s a wonderful thing, I\u2019m very lucky. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s happened, but it\u2019s been very good fortune for me.\n\nIn regards to your young co-star, Iain Armitage, you two seemed to have a great onscreen rapport from the get-go.\n\nOh, well, he is not only an outrageously talented actor \u2014 because he\u2019s absolutely nothing like this character that he plays \u2014 but he\u2019s very \u2026 Well, I can only say I adore working with him, and I\u2019m thrilled when I see that I\u2019m going to be doing a scene with him. He\u2019s an amazingly warm person.\n\nAnd Annie Potts, you\u2019ve been in a voice cast with her several times now, but this is the first time you\u2019ve actually worked with her.\n\n[Laughs.] Yes, absolutely! I\u2019m blessed. I\u2019m really very blessed. It\u2019s been a joyful experience to have her as a partner.\n\nWhen it comes to your own TV viewing, do you tend toward sitcoms? Given your work as a playwright, my instinct is that the answer is \u201cno,\u201d but you never know.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve never owned a television, and I still don\u2019t, so I really haven\u2019t understood anything that people have said to me for the last 40 years. I don\u2019t understand references to TV shows, famous TV commercials, important sports events \u2026 So I\u2019ve acted on sitcoms more than I\u2019ve watched them, really! But it\u2019s certainly been a very, very congenial forum for me to work in. I\u2019ve done some very wonderful sitcoms, including The Cosby Show and Murphy Brown. I was even on a couple of episodes of Taxi! I\u2019m definitely sort of in awe of the best of these short little dramas.\n\nEven going back to my childhood, when my parents did have a television, I saw, for instance, The Honeymooners, some of the episodes of which I watched again recently. In some ways, I admire those episodes more than the plays of that period. Certainly the acting of Jackie Gleason and Audrey Meadows \u2026 These people were great actors, maybe better than the people who won the Tonys and the Oscars at that time.\n\nForgive me, but I\u2019m very curious about this never-owned-a-TV thing. Since your parents did have a TV, was it originally an act of rebellion for you to not have one?\n\nWell, I think it was maybe an instinct. A fear of brainwashing? I don\u2019t know. My girlfriend and I both grew up in a certain generation that was somewhat rebellious about TV. We didn\u2019t know each other then, but when we were 12 or 13, we both were very influenced by George Orwell\u2019s book 1984, which sort of had a frightening and somewhat accurate view of the TV screen as having an overwhelming influence.\n\nI think I thought it might be not so beneficial to watch the regular news shows and the commercials. I think I was afraid of it. I do find television very seductive. I mean, I spend a certain amount of time in hotel rooms, and sometimes I just don\u2019t ever turn on the television, and sometimes I become obsessed and watch many, many shows in a row. So I didn\u2019t want to spend my time watching television, and my girlfriend didn\u2019t really find television very appealing. We didn\u2019t have a very big apartment, and we just didn\u2019t get into it. And we never have! Although now we have computers, so you can watch a TV show if you want to. Maybe not at the time it\u2019s being shown to the general public, but if you want to look up a TV show, it\u2019s easy to do now.\n\nYour original career path had not been toward acting. What led you that direction? Did you just see it as an extension of being a playwright?\n\nWell, my close friend Wilfred Leach asked me to perform in a translation I had done for him at the Public Theater in New York, and he offered to pay me to perform in the play. And the part theoretically was not too difficult, so I said yes. And it sort of developed from there. I realized I could really support my life as a playwright by being an actor, at least for a little while. And each time the acting has seemed to be fading out and I\u2019ve thought, Maybe I should figure out some other way to make a living, it\u2019s revived!\n\nYou\u2019ve got a few signature films in your back catalogue, but is there a favorite project you\u2019ve worked on over the years that didn\u2019t get the love you\u2019d hoped it would?\n\nWell, Andre Gregory and I spent 17 years working on our production of Ibsen that became the film A Master Builder, directed by Jonathan Demme, and I would say there are quite a few people out there who\u2019ve never seen that movie, if you can believe it!\n\nThankfully, it\u2019s been released by Criterion, which certainly ups its chances of being seen.\n\nYes, it\u2019s definitely on Criterion, and no one is stopping anyone from seeing it.\n\nYou and Andre have collaborated a number of times over the years. When you and he first met, did you get along immediately, or did it take some time to find a groove while working together?\n\nHe was the first person in professional theater to like my writing, so that was an overwhelming thrill for me. Because I was so absolutely determined that I wanted to spend my life writing plays, but I hadn\u2019t yet found anyone who actually worked in the theater who liked what I was writing. So that was a very big deal for me.\n\nA friend of mine moderated a panel that you did a few years ago, and he was surprised that you were surprised that people were actually aware of My Dinner With Andre.\n\nWell, it\u2019s had periods where it was less spoken about or known about. But, yeah, in the Trump period, it\u2019s become much more popular. Andre makes some rather prescient comments in that film, and people have thought, Wow, he predicted the future! How did they know in 1981? But there have been some bits of My Dinner With Andre that have been seen on social media a shocking number of times.\n\nPlus, once The Simpsons slipped a My Dinner With Andre video game into an episode, it\u2019s probably fair to say that most of the world at large at least now knows it exists.\n\nExactly!\n\nThe Princess Bride and Clueless have cemented your place on the mainstream pop-culture landscape. Do people who call out lines from your characters while you\u2019re walking down the street?\n\nYes, there\u2019s \u2026 a certain amount of that. I have a lot of different lives going on at the same time. So I may be walking down the street, thinking very angry political thoughts, and people stop me and say lines of mine from a movie I made 30 years ago! And, you know, I\u2019m briefly startled and look at them as if they\u2019re insane. But that\u2019s my life. That\u2019s my destiny, it seems.\n\nI can only tell you that, in responding to the fact that I was going to be talking to you today, I\u2019m sure no less than 75 people uttered the \u201cI\u201d word.\n\nWell, you know, we don\u2019t get to choose what other people think about us. Of course, an actor is sort of seen as responsible not only for the things he himself has done or said or thought, but also what the characters that he\u2019s played have said or thought. So it\u2019s a peculiar destiny. But apparently it\u2019s my destiny.\n\nEven my political writings are a little bit known. I mean, they\u2019re known to one out of maybe 100,000 people. But people do sometimes come up and say, \u201cI really appreciate what you\u2019ve done.\u201d And, you know, it\u2019s a lovely feeling in a way, but for me, I am a little bit confused, and I don\u2019t quite know what to say, because it\u2019s hard to say, \u201cWell, which of my great accomplishments have led you to say that?\u201d [Laughs.] But on the other hand, if I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m at a little bit of a loss for even how to respond. But obviously, in a roughly general way, you could say it\u2019s pleasurable to have people compliment you on the street. I mean, I have also had the experience of being criticized on the street \u2026 and elsewhere! I think to some extent, whatever harm it\u2019s done to my ego to be complimented as an actor is slightly compensated for by the hostility I\u2019ve received as a writer. So I\u2019m hoping that I come out not overly bloated with arrogance because of the experience of having been amusing in different movies.\n\nWell, if there\u2019s ever been a time for political writing, we\u2019re definitely living through it right now. Not that there haven\u2019t been plenty of times prior to this as well, but this is definitely one of them.\n\n[Laughs.] Yes, although it\u2019s challenging to write about the time that you\u2019re living in. And this is a particularly tough one in some ways because of the crudeness of the evils. It was very hard to know whether there was anything new or interesting to say in the George Bush era in the area of \u201cI think torture is bad.\u201d How do you say something new and interesting along the lines of \u201cRacism is evil\u201d and \u201cActually, climate catastrophe is real\u201d? I mean, to write, you want to say something new and valuable and interesting, and in a funny way, the stupider the target, the more difficult it is to write valuable criticism of it. You know, aside from just sort of yelling, \u201cUgh!\u201d\n\nTo circle back to Young Sheldon, will we be seeing you again soon? Where do things stand with you and your character\u2019s relationship with Annie Potts?\n\nWell, we just don\u2019t know! My character has suffered a great loss of confidence, as can happen if you have a mental collapse, and the relationship of our characters gets disrupted by my character going into the mental hospital, so as far as what happens going forward \u2026 Well, it\u2019s up to the writers. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see!", "description": "An interview with Wallace Shawn about his role on \u2018Young Sheldon,\u2019 getting recognized by fans on the street for Clueless and The Princess Bride (and sometimes even My Dinner With Andre), and why he doesn\u2019t own a TV.", "authors": ["Will Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-wallace-shawn-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
