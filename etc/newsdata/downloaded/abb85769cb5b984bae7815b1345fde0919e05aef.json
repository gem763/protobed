(Image: Delacorte Press)\n\nIn 2018, we were thrilled to share the first peek at Skyward, the brand-new YA book from acclaimed sci-fi and fantasy author Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn, Stormlight Archive). Now, Gizmodo has another treat for Sanderson fans: the first excerpt from Skyward\u2019s sequel, Starsight.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of Starsight.\n\nAll her life, Spensa has dreamed of becoming a pilot. Of proving she\u2019s a hero like her father. She made it to the sky, but the truths she learned about her father were crushing. The rumours of his cowardice are true \u2014 he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them. Spensa is sure there\u2019s more to the story. And she\u2019s sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the stars \u2014 and it was terrifying. Everything Spensa has been taught about her world is a lie. But Spensa also discovered a few other things about herself \u2014 and she\u2019ll travel to the end of the galaxy to save humankind if she needs to.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the full cover, followed by the excerpt:\n\n1\n\nI slammed on my overburn and boosted my starship through the middle of a chaotic mess of destructor blasts and explosions. Above me extended the awesome vastness of space. Compared to that infinite blackness, both planets and starships alike seemed insignificant. Meaningless.\n\nExcept, of course, for the fact that those insignificant starships were doing their best to kill me.\n\nI dodged, spinning my ship and cutting my boosters midturn. Once I\u2019d flipped around, I immediately slammed on the boosters again, burning in the other direction in an attempt to lose the three ships tailing me.\n\nFighting in space is way different from fighting in atmosphere. For one thing, your wings are useless. No air means no airflow, no lift, no drag. In space, you don\u2019t really fly. You just don\u2019t fall.\n\nI executed another spin and boost, heading back toward the main firefight. Unfortunately, manoeuvres that had been impressive down in the atmosphere were commonplace up here. Fighting in a vacuum these last six months had provided a whole new set of skills to master.\n\n\u201cSpensa,\u201d a lively masculine voice said from my console, \u201cyou remember how you told me to warn you if you were being extra irrational?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said with a grunt, dodging to the right. The destructor blasts from behind swept over the dome of my cockpit. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I did anything of the sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said, \u2018Can we talk about this later?\u2019 \u201d\n\nI dodged again. Scud. Were those drones getting better at dogfighting, or was I losing my touch?\n\n\u201cTechnically, it was \u2018later\u2019 right after you spoke,\u201d continued the talkative voice\u2014my ship\u2019s AI, M-Bot. \u201cBut human beings don\u2019t actually use that word to mean \u2018anytime chronologically after this moment.\u2019 They use it to mean \u2018sometime after now that is more convenient to me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Krell drones swarmed around us, trying to cut off my escape back toward the main body of the battlefield.\n\n\u201cAnd you think this is a more convenient time?\u201d I demanded.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re in combat!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I would think that a life-and-death situation is exactly when you\u2019d like to know if you\u2019re being extra irrational.\u201d\n\nI could remember, with some measure of fondness, the days when my starships hadn\u2019t talked back to me. That had been before I\u2019d helped repair M-Bot, whose personality was a remnant of ancient technology we still didn\u2019t understand. I frequently wondered: Had all advanced AIs been this sassy, or was mine just a special case?\n\n\u201cSpensa,\u201d M-Bot said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be leading these drones toward the others, remember?\u201d\n\nIt had been six months since we\u2019d beaten back the Krell attempt to bomb us into oblivion. Alongside our victory, we\u2019d learned some important facts. The enemy we called \u201cthe Krell\u201d were a group of aliens tasked with keeping my people contained on our planet, Detritus, which was kind of a cross between a prison and a nature preserve for human civilisation. The Krell reported to a larger galactic government called the Superiority.\n\nThey employed remote drones to fight us\u2014piloted by aliens who lived far away, controlling their drones via faster-than-light communications. The drones were never driven by AIs, as it was against galactic law to let a ship pilot itself. Even M-Bot was severely limited in what he could do on his own. Beyond that, there was something that the Superiority feared deeply: people who had the ability to see into the space where FTL communication happened. People called cytonics.\n\nPeople like me.\n\nThey knew what I was, and they hated me. The drones tended to target me specifically\u2014and we could use that. We should use that. In today\u2019s pre-battle briefing, I\u2019d swayed the rest of the pilots reluctantly to go with a bold plan. I was to get a little out of formation, tempt the enemy drones to swarm me, then lead them back through the rest of the team. My friends could then eliminate the drones while they were focused on me.\n\nIt was a sound plan. And I\u2019d make good on it . . . eventually. Now, though, I wanted to test something.\n\nI hit my overburn, accelerating away from the enemy ships. M-Bot was faster and more manoeuvrable than they were, though part of his big advantage had been in his ability to manoeuvre at high speed in air without ripping himself apart. Out here in a vacuum that wasn\u2019t a factor, and the enemy drones did a better job of keeping up.\n\nThey swarmed after me as I dove toward Detritus. My home-world was protected by layers of ancient metal platforms\u2014like shells\u2014with gun emplacements all along them. After our victory six months ago, we\u2019d pushed the Krell farther away from the planet, past the shells. Our current long-term strategy was to engage the enemy out here in space and keep them from getting close to the planet.\n\nKeeping them out here had allowed our engineers\u2014including my friend Rodge\u2014to start gaining control of the platforms and their guns. Eventually, that shell of gun emplacements should protect our planet from incursions. For now though, most of those defensive platforms were still autonomous\u2014and could be as dangerous for us as they were for the enemy.\n\nThe Krell ships swarmed in behind me, eager to cut me off from the battlefield\u2014where my friends were engaging the rest of the drones in a massive brawl. That tactic of isolating me made one fatal assumption: that if I was alone, I\u2019d be less dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn back around and follow the plan, are we?\u201d M-Bot asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to try to fight them on your own.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cJorgen is going to be aaaaaangry,\u201d M-Bot said. \u201cBy the way, those drones are trying to chase you along a specific heading, which I\u2019m outlining on your monitor. My analysis projects that they\u2019ve planned an ambush.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cJust trying to keep you from getting me blown up,\u201d M-Bot said. \u201cBy the way, if you do get us killed, be warned that I intend to haunt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaunt me?\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re a robot. And besides, I\u2019d be dead too, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy robotic ghost would haunt your fleshy one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would that even work?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpensa, ghosts aren\u2019t real,\u201d he said in an exasperated tone. \u201cWhy are you worrying about things like that instead of flying? Honestly, humans get distracted so easily.\u201d\n\nI spotted the ambush: a small group of Krell drones had hidden themselves by a large chunk of metal floating just out of range of the gun emplacements. As I drew close, the ambushing drones emerged and rocketed toward me. I was ready though. I let my arms relax, let my subconscious mind take over. I sank into myself, entering a kind of trance where I listened.\n\nJust not with my ears.\n\nRemote drones worked fine for the Krell in most situations. They were an expendable way to suppress the humans of Detritus. However, the enormous distances involved in space battle forced the Krell to rely on instantaneous faster-than-light communication to control their drones. I suspected their pilots were far away\u2014 but even if they were on the Krell station that hung out in space near Detritus, the lag of radio communications from there would make the drones too slow to react in battle. So, FTL was necessary.\n\nThat exposed one major flaw. I could hear their orders.\n\nFor some reason I didn\u2019t understand, I could listen into the place where FTL communication happened. I called it the nowhere, another dimension where our rules of physics didn\u2019t apply. I could hear into the place, occasionally see into it\u2014and see the creatures that lived there watching me.\n\nA single time, in the climactic battle six months ago, I\u2019d managed to enter that place and teleport my ship a long distance in the blink of an eye. I still didn\u2019t know much about my powers. I hadn\u2019t been able to teleport again, but I\u2019d been learning that whatever existed inside me, I could harness it and use it to fight.\n\nI let my instincts take over, and sent my ship into a complex sequence of dodges. My battle-trained reflexes, melded with my innate ability to hear the drone orders, manoeuvred my ship without specific conscious instructions on my part.\n\nMy cytonic ability had been passed down my family line. My ancestors had used it to move ancient starfleets around the galaxy. My father had had the ability, and the enemy had exploited it to get him killed. Now I used it to stay alive.\n\nI reacted before the Krell did, responding to their orders\u2014somehow, I processed them even faster than the drones could. By the time they attacked, I was already weaving through their destructor blasts. I darted among them, then fired my IMP, bringing down the shields of everyone nearby.\n\nIn my state of focused concentration, I didn\u2019t care that the IMP took down my shield too. It didn\u2019t matter.\n\nI launched my light-lance, and the rope of energy speared one of the enemy ships, connecting it to my own. I then used the difference in our momentum to spin us both around, which put me into position behind the pack of defenseless ships.\n\nBlossoms of light and sparks broke the void as I destroyed two of the drones. The remaining Krell scattered like villagers before a wolf in one of Gran-Gran\u2019s stories. The ambush turned chaotic as I picked a pair of ships and gunned for them with destructors\u2014 blasting one away as a part of my mind tracked the orders being given to the others.\n\n\u201cI never fail to be amazed when you do that,\u201d M-Bot said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re interpreting data faster than my projections. You seem almost . . . inhuman.\u201d\n\nI gritted my teeth, bracing, and spun my ship, boosting it after a straggling Krell drone.\n\n\u201cI mean that as a compliment, by the way,\u201d M-Bot said. \u201cNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with humans. I find their frail, emotionally unstable, irrational natures quite endearing.\u201d\n\nI destroyed that drone and bathed my hull in the light of its fiery demise. Then I dodged right between the shots of two others. Though the Krell drones didn\u2019t have pilots on board, a part of me felt sorry for them as they tried to fight back against me\u2014an unstoppable, unknowable force that did not play by the same rules that bound everything else they knew.\n\n\u201cLikely,\u201d M-Bot continued, \u201cI regard humans as I do only because I\u2019m programmed to do so. But hey, that\u2019s no different from instinct programming a mother bird to love the twisted, featherless abominations she spawns, right?\u201d\n\nInhuman.\n\nI wove and dodged, fired and destroyed. I wasn\u2019t perfect; I occasionally overcompensated and many of my shots missed. But I had a distinct edge.\n\nThe Superiority\u2014and its minions the Krell\u2014obviously knew to watch for people like me and my father. Their ships were always on the hunt for humans who flew too well or who responded too quickly. They\u2019d tried controlling my mind by exploiting a weakness in my talent\u2014the same thing they\u2019d done to my father. Fortunately, I had M-Bot. His advanced shielding was capable of filtering out their mental attacks while still allowing me to hear the enemy orders.\n\nAll of this raised a singular daunting question. What was I?\n\n\u201cI would feel a lot more comfortable,\u201d M-Bot said, \u201cif you\u2019d find a chance to reignite our shield.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo time,\u201d I said. We\u2019d need a good thirty seconds without flight controls to do that.\n\nI had another chance to break toward the main battle, to follow through with the plan I\u2019d outlined. Instead I spun, then hit the overburn and blasted back toward the enemy ships. My gravitational capacitors absorbed a large percentage of the g-forces and kept me from suffering too much whiplash, but I still felt pressure flattening me against my seat, making my skin pull back and my body feel heavy. Under extreme g-forces, I felt like I\u2019d aged a hundred years in a second.\n\nI pushed through it and fired at the remaining Krell drones. I strained my strange skills to their limits. A Krell destructor shot grazed the dome of my canopy, so bright it left an afterimage in my eyes.\n\n\u201cSpensa,\u201d M-Bot said. \u201cBoth Jorgen and Cobb have called to complain. I know you said to keep them distracted, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep them distracted.\u201d\n\n\u201cResigned sigh.\u201d\n\nI looped us after an enemy ship. \u201cDid you just say the words resigned sigh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI find human nonlinguistic communications to be too easily misinterpreted,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m experimenting with ways to make them more explicit.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that defeat the purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously not. Dismissive eye-roll.\u201d\n\nDestructors flared around me, but I blasted two more drones. As I did, I saw something appear, reflected in the canopy of my cockpit. A handful of piercing white lights, like eyes, watching me. When I used my abilities too much, something looked out of the nowhere and saw me.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what they were. I just called them the eyes. But I could feel a burning hatred from them. An anger. Somehow, this was all connected. My ability to see and hear into the nowhere, the eyes that watched me from that place, and the teleportation power I\u2019d only managed to use once.\n\nI could still distinctly remember how I\u2019d felt when I\u2019d used it. I\u2019d been on the brink of death, being enveloped by a cataclysmic explosion. In that moment, somehow I\u2019d activated something called a cytonic hyperdrive.\n\nIf I could master that ability to teleport, I could help free my people from Detritus. With that power, we could escape the Krell forever. And so I pushed myself.\n\nLast time I\u2019d jumped I\u2019d been fighting for my life. If I could only re-create those same emotions . . .\n\nI dove, my right hand on my control sphere, my left holding the throttle. Three drones swept in behind me, but I registered their shots and turned my ship at an angle so they all missed. I hit the throttle and my mind brushed the nowhere.\n\nThe eyes continued to appear, reflected in the canopy, as if it were revealing something that watched from behind my seat. White lights, like stars, but somehow more . . . aware. Dozens of malevolent glowing dots. In entering their realm, even slightly, I became visible to them.\n\nThose eyes unnerved me. How could I be both fascinated by these powers and terrified of them at the same time? It was like the call of the void you felt when standing at the edge of a large cliff in the caverns, knowing you could just throw yourself off into that darkness. One step farther . . .\n\n\u201cSpensa!\u201d M-Bot said. \u201cNew ship arriving!\u201d\n\nI pulled out of my trance, and the eyes vanished. M-Bot used the console display to highlight what he\u2019d spotted. A new starfighter, almost invisible against the black sky, emerged from where the others had been hiding. Sleek, it was shaped like a disc and painted the same black as space. It was smaller than normal Krell ships, but it had a larger canopy.\n\nThese new black ships had only started appearing in the last eight months, in the days leading up to the attempt to bomb our base. Back then we hadn\u2019t realised what they meant, but now we knew.\n\nI couldn\u2019t hear the commands this ship received\u2014because none were being sent to it. Black ships like this one were not remote controlled. Instead, they carried real alien pilots. Usually an enemy ace\u2014the best of their pilots.\n\nThe battle had just gotten far more interesting.\n\nStarsight by Brandon Sanderson goes on sale November 26; you can pre-order a copy here.", "description": "In 2018, we were thrilled to share the first peek at Skyward, the brand-new YA book from acclaimed sci-fi and fantasy author Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn, Stormlight Archive).
