I don't think she contributes anything to the show and she lacks local knowledge,' he said.\n\n'She's not able to guess who the right person is, not that it's easy, but she keeps putting up LA people who couldn't possibly be on the show.'\n\nHowever the news of Lindsay's return to the program hasn't all been negative, with another commentator telling News Corp that she's 'very good talent'.\n\nDaily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Ten for comment.\n\nPeter Cox told The Daily Telegraph's Confidential: 'She's not able to guess who the right person is, not that it's easy, but she keeps putting up LA people who couldn't possibly be on the show'\n\nOn Thursday, Channel Ten's chief content officer Beverley McGarvey confirmed a second season, telling News.com.au: 'Despite what you may have read, we will have exactly the same judging lineup and exactly the same host.'\n\nMcGarvey said the network is 'thrilled [all the judges] are coming back', adding that season two of The Masked singer 'will be really exciting'.\n\nFeminist blog Jezebel, formerly part of the now-defunct Gawker Media company, published an article last week mocking Lindsay's skills as a celebrity guesser.\n\nA post titled 'Lindsay Lohan Has Been Unmasked as a Terrible Judge on The Masked Singer Australia' claimed that she had 'failed to identify a single Australian celebrity contestant' on the show.\n\nReturning: Channel Ten confirmed all four judges of The Masked Singer will return for a second season in 2020. Pictured from left to right: Dannii Minogue, guest Luke McGregor, Jackie O Henderson, Lindsay and Dave Hughes\n\nThis is actually incorrect, as she did correctly identify Wendell Sailor as the Rhino.\n\nThe same website also repeated The Blast's claims about Lindsay's supposed 'feud' with Jackie O, using the headline 'Lindsay Lohan Is Already Feuding With Someone on The Masked Singer Australia'.\n\nLindsay previously denied the reports that her diva demands were making waves behind the scenes.\n\nSpeaking on the Kyle and Jackie O Show earlier this month, Lindsay chalked the rumours up to people who were just digging for 'negativity'.\n\n'People want to find the negative for no reason. There was nothing negative about [filming The Masked Singer],' she said.\n\nRadio host Jackie O Henderson, who is also a judge on The Masked Singer, added that production was 'the best experience' and 'so much fun'.\n\nLindsay has previously criticised the U.S. tabloid media over its fascination with her, especially during her 'wild' days in the late-2000s.\n\nShe told The New York Times last year: 'People have to just let go of [my past] and stop bringing it up because it's not - it's gone. It's dead.'", "description": "Channel Ten confirmed on Thursday that all four judges of The Masked Singer will return for a second season in 2020.", "authors": ["Kristy Johnson For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/15/19656820-0-image-a-100_1570975852426.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
