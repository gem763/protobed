Murkowski that it would have been inappropriate to withhold the military aid unless this political investigation was pursued?\n\nPOMPEO: George, I'm telling you what I was involved with. I'm telling you what I saw transpiring and how President Trump was working to make the evaluation about whether it was appropriate to provide this assistance.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: What I'm asking is would it be appropriate to --\n\nPOMPEO: George, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals and secondary things based on what someone else has said.

Pompeo said that it's his policy not to discuss internal deliberations publicly, despite the fact that Giuliani does not work for the administration.\n\nPompeo also refused to answer whether Giuliani was reviewed for potential conflicts of interest, amid revelations that he had business interests in Ukraine at the same time he was pushing officials to open an investigation into Joe Biden.\n\nGiuliani is reportedly under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in New York that he once ran.\n\nGo deeper: EU ambassador testifies he was \"disappointed\" with Trump's Ukraine approach", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
