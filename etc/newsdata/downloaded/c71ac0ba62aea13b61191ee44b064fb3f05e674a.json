Police say five videos were uploaded to the porn site only months ago. The report of the \"peeping Tom\" behavior says the videos' angle suggests the camera was on a sink.\n\nThe four-year college near the North Carolina border is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of Spartanburg.\n\nA college statement released Wednesday says it's assisting in the investigation. Reports say a suspect hasn't yet been identified. It's unclear if law enforcement has notified the women in the videos.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
