REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n\u201cThere was no discussion about anything else,\u201d Morrison, who made a state visit to the White House on Friday, told journalists, according to a transcript.\n\n\u201cThere was an appreciation of our involvement in that particular operation which was I remind everyone is about freedom of navigation in the Straits of Hormuz. That\u2019s what that is about. The other matters that are being pursued by the United States are matters that they\u2019re pursuing.\u201d\n\nTrump last week approved sending U.S. troops to bolster Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defenses after the largest-ever attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities, which the United States has squarely blamed on Iran.\n\nTension between the United States and Iran has been rising since President Trump abandoned the Iranian nuclear agreement last year and the attack on the oil facilities has spurred concerns of an escalation into a new war.\n\nThe U.S. president had signaled he would raise with Morrison a possible military contribution in Iran, although later he said the topic had not been discussed.\n\nIn August, Australia joined the U.S-led International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) in support of freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear when we announced our involvement in that arrangement that it was very much about that freedom of navigation issue and that\u2019s what it is about and that\u2019s appreciated,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nHe also praised Trump for what he said was a \u201crestraint\u201d in relation to Iran.\n\n\u201cAnd it was good to have the opportunity to confirm that again in the course of our discussions,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cSo I think that should provide some assurance. I mean Australia will make its decisions in our national interest.\u201d", "description": "Australia is not getting involved with the United States in its pursuit of aims in relation to Iran, beyond a commitment to freedom of navigation in the region, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Lidia Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432528906&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L044", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
