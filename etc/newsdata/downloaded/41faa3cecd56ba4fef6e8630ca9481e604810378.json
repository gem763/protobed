After her junior year in high school, she interned at the tech giant\u2019s Poughkeepsie, N.Y., campus, 20 miles north of her hometown, for $17 an hour. For a year, Rodriguez has worked 40-hour weeks as an apprentice test technician, examining IBM mainframes to confirm they work before shipping them to customers. In January, she\u2019ll move to a permanent position with a future salary that she says, is \u201cdefinitely much more than I ever thought I\u2019d be making at 19.\u201d\n\nRodriguez\u2019s opportunities with IBM came to her thanks to her high school, Newburgh Free Academy P-TECH. It\u2019s part of an innovative public-school model that combines grade 9-12 education with internships and tuition-free community college. P-TECH, which stands for Pathways in Technology Early College High School, has spread to 10 states and 17 countries since its founding in Brooklyn in 2011. The P-TECH network is growing fast. By the end of 2019, there will be 220 P-TECH schools in operation. With 93,000 students nationwide, it is one of the most extensive career and technical education programs in the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor public school districts, starting P-TECH schools is a way to try to address the \u201cskills gap\u201d\u2014American education\u2019s often-elusive goal of tying vocational training to what actual employers such as IBM and Cisco and Microsoft want. It focuses on the much-valued STEM subjects\u2014science, technology, engineering and math. It aims to prepare students for so-called new collar jobs: work in tech that requires more than a high school diploma, but not always a four-year college degree. And at a time when free college education is surging toward the top of the progressive agenda, it\u2019s an affordable free-college program that\u2019s taken root in poorer cities, boosting high school graduation rates and two-year-college completion rates among students of color and immigrants.\n\n\n\nP-TECH interns showed off their projects at an exposition hosted by IBM in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nIn 2014, Newburgh, an industrial city of 28,000 in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley, was struggling with widespread abandoned properties and the state\u2019s highest murder rate. A majority-Hispanic city where 31 percent of people are impoverished, Newburgh embraced a statewide expansion of the P-TECH program as a strategy for building opportunity. It launched its P-TECH school with a class of 50 ninth-graders.\n\nDid you have a non-traditional college experience? Leave us a voicemail at (202) 922-6112 and we might share your story.\n\nRodriguez signed up. \u201cSince none of my family had ever really graduated from high school or college,\u201d she says, \u201cI was very interested in the aspect of getting a free college degree.\u201d Rodriguez and 16 classmates who jumped onto P-TECH\u2019s fast track finished the six-year program in four years.\n\nIn spring 2018, Rodriguez graduated with both a high school diploma and an associate\u2019s degree in cybersecurity from Orange County Community College. An undocumented immigrant, Rodriguez couldn\u2019t get federal financial aid to attend a four-year college. But she\u2019s authorized to work through the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program, so she took advantage of another part of P-TECH\u2019s model: a job interview with IBM after graduation. This August, she became the first Newburgh P-TECH grad to get a full-time job with IBM. Earlier this year, she spoke, along with IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Rodriguez is now a night-school student at Dutchess Community College, with a goal of getting a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in two years, and a master\u2019s in five years.\n\nNewburgh, N.Y. has struggled with unemployment and crime. Mayor Torrance Harvey, bottom right, believes the P-TECH program can help the city improve its economic profile by training students to fill well-paying jobs in the area. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nRodriguez is the first Newburgh graduate to go from IBM intern to apprentice to full employee, but others are likely to follow soon. IBM, which helped launch the first P-TECH school in 2011, is now affiliated with at least 30 P-TECHs worldwide. It has hired 30 of the 240 students who\u2019ve graduated from IBM-affiliated P-TECHs so far, paying each a starting salary of at least $50,000.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThe P-TECH experience really helped me feel more confident overall, and it helped me learn a lot of skills that I am still today using,\u201d says Rodriguez, \u201clike collaborating and communicating, professional e-mail writing, and knowing when to ask questions and when to just listen.\u201d\n\nNewburgh\u2019s mayor, Torrance Harvey, is also a full-time P-TECH history teacher. He says the school helps Newburgh\u2019s efforts to recover from its early-2010s crime epidemic. \u201cPublic safety is always our No. 1 priority, but the next thing is how to create meaningful employment for our residents,\u201d Harvey says. Newburgh P-TECH students complete associate\u2019s degrees in either computer networking or cybersecurity\u2014fast-growing fields, Harvey notes, whose importance has grown after Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election and enormous data breaches suffered by corporate giants such as Target and Equifax.\n\n\u201cThese are inner-city Newburgh kids,\u201d the mayor says of his P-TECH students, \u201cand this program has changed the trajectory of their earning potential and their career potential and their education.\u201d\n\nNewburgh\u2019s P-TECH campus opened in 2014. Principal Kevin Rothman talks to Mayor Torrance Harvey, who also teaches history at P-TECH. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nNewburgh\u2019s trajectory is changing too. Gun violence has declined 80 percent since 2015. City Hall has launched an aggressive revitalization plan, bulldozing buildings that had stood abandoned for decades. \u201cWe were able to get businesses to return back to the city,\u201d Harvey says. \u201cWe were able to get new home ownership. People are investing in our city like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe P-TECH idea was invented in 2010, when then-IBM CEO Sam Palmisano was chatting up his friend Joel Klein, then New York City\u2019s schools chancellor. During a rain delay at the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Palmisano told Klein that the tech industry was having trouble finding young people with the skills it needed. Klein proposed opening a six-year school with the City University of New York and curriculum input from IBM. Students could work IBM internships and, if they passed a company certification test, would be first in line for job interviews at IBM. Palmisano agreed. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced the plan in September 2010 and gave the partners a year to open the school.\n\nWhen Klein and Palmisano shook on the deal, vocational education was just beginning to emerge from the academic backwater where it had languished for decades. Conceived a century ago so high school students could learn a trade if they weren\u2019t going to college, vocational education had developed a reputation as a dumping ground for students who weren\u2019t doing well in regular academics. Harvard\u2019s influential Pathways to Prosperity report, released in 2011, warned that nearly two-thirds of new jobs of the 2010s would require more than a high school education\u2014yet only 40 percent of Americans had obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree or associate\u2019s degree by their mid-20s.\n\nDowntown Newburgh has been hit hard economically. Vincent Lacertosa, 18, from Newburgh, is a P-TECH graduate and an apprentice at IBM where he tests main frame computers. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nBy contrast, the report noted, 40 to 70 percent of high school kids in many European countries spent three years in career programs that combined classroom and workplace experience, where they earned diplomas or certificates strongly valued in the labor market. Eight years later, critics of American career and technical education, as it\u2019s called today, still complain that it needs to become more academically rigorous, better prepare students for education beyond high school, and provide actual work experience based on the needs of today\u2019s employers.\n\nThe first P-TECH, in Brooklyn, emulated the workplace learning focus of European vocational education while eliminating tuition costs. It established design principles that still apply to all the 200-plus P-TECH schools today. The entire program, including the community college courses, is cost-free. (P-TECH schools are funded through various combinations of local tax dollars, state funding, federal career-ed grants, and cost-sharing with local community colleges.) They\u2019re open-enrollment schools, with no testing or grade requirements for admission, and they focus on disadvantaged youth. The high school, the community college and the industry partner work together. The curriculum includes workplace skills, such as public speaking, as well as company mentors and paid internships. Graduates are first in line for job interviews at the partner company.\n\nSuriana Rodriguez, 19, is the first Newburgh P-TECH graduate to get a full-time job offer from IBM. She\u2019s currently an apprentice at IBM\u2019s campus in Poughkeepsie, above. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nPolitical leaders quickly embraced the model, excited by its combination of career and technical education, paid internships and early college. Barack Obama praised Brooklyn\u2019s P-TECH in his 2013 State of the Union address and visited the school later that year. \u201cThis is a ticket into the middle class, and it\u2019s available to everybody who\u2019s willing to work for it,\u201d Obama said in an address at the school.\n\nA year earlier, in 2012, Chicago\u2019s then-mayor, Rahm Emanuel, had inked a deal with IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Verizon and Motorola to open five P-TECHs there. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo debuted a state P-TECH program in 2014, pledging $28 million over seven years for 18 new schools, including Newburgh\u2019s. Connecticut opened its first P-TECH school, in Norwalk, in 2014, with then-Gov. Dannel Malloy cutting the ceremonial ribbon. P-TECH schools are popular in Northeastern cities and states, but have also caught on in Dallas, Baton Rouge and Colorado. Though Democratic governors and mayors have championed them, their public-private collaborations have also won over Larry Hogan, Maryland\u2019s Republican governor.\n\nDanille Jager is the liaison between Newburgh P-Tech and IBM. At a recent exposition for P-TECH interns, attendees got their passports stamped after they heard presentations from the students. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nIn Baltimore, a conversation between Hogan and Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels, soon after the city\u2019s 2015 riots, led to the creation of two P-TECH schools in 2016. One is affiliated with IBM, while the other, located on the edge of Johns Hopkins\u2019 hospital campus, is focused on health care, with the hospital and Kaiser Permanente as industry partners. This summer, 10 of its 200 students completed internships at the University of Maryland\u2019s shock trauma center and John Hopkins\u2019 anesthesiology, neurology and orthopedics departments.\n\nNow, eight P-TECH schools are operating in Maryland, including four in Baltimore, with some state funding. The Maryland Chamber of Commerce has organized a consortium of 400 businesses to offer mentors, internships and job interviews to P-TECH students. \u201cThe challenge in the P-TECH schools is not whether or not the individual jurisdiction wants to do it,\u201d says Keiffer Mitchell, a special adviser to Hogan. \u201cIt\u2019s just finding enough businesses that can take on internships for the kids, and also have ideas [about] hiring those kids.\u201d\n\nThis May, Hogan signed a bill allowing for three more P-TECH schools in Maryland, after the state Senate killed his proposal to remove a state cap on the program\u2019s expansion. \u201cWe\u2019re not against it,\u201d Paul Pinsky, chairman of the Maryland Senate\u2019s education committee, told the Baltimore Sun. \u201cIt\u2019s just we haven\u2019t gotten the data back about whether it\u2019s working or not.\u201d\n\nResults have taken a while to emerge, since P-TECH schools are six-year programs, and most aren\u2019t six years old yet. But the inaugural class at the original P-TECH in Brooklyn achieved a stunning 100 percent high school graduation rate, followed by 87 percent for the second class and 93 percent for the third\u2014compared with graduation rates of 71-74 percent for their peers across New York City. Fifty-seven percent of the first class and 39 percent of the second class also graduated with the no-cost associate\u2019s degree in a computer science field. Brooklyn P-TECH\u2019s principal, Rashid Davis, notes that many students who didn\u2019t get the associate\u2019s degree took college courses, then transferred the credits to four-year colleges.\n\nAt Norwalk High School in Connecticut, P-TECH students study web design. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nAbout 70 percent of the Brooklyn P-TECH students are low income. Just under a third of the student body female and 55 percent of the students are black males. And P-TECH is not achieving those high graduation rates by taking it easy on the students. Davis says students at the open-enrollment Brooklyn P-TECH are achieving results on New York state college-readiness tests that are comparable with New York City\u2019s screened and specialized high schools.\n\n\u201cStudents are buying into the culture,\u201d Davis says. \u201cOur attendance rate still hovers above 90 percent. That is as key indicator that students are wanting to be in this environment.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nVocational education used to teach students how to weld or how to fix a car. Today\u2019s career and technical education means something much different. Students are learning to code software, design websites, or operate robots and AI systems that have replaced manual-labor jobs across much of the economy.\n\nChina Tinnen and Nico Tullio are juniors in the P-TECH program at Norwalk High School. As part of the six-year program, P-TECH students take classes at nearby Norwalk Community College. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nThis August, rising seniors at the P-TECH high school in Norwalk, Conn., gathered at Norwalk Community College for the P-TECH Norwalk Intern Expo. To mark the end of their summer internships, the students gave presentations on their work for their parents and their IBM mentors.\n\nBianca Velez and Pongsa Tayjasanant, both 17, stood behind a table and told passersby what they did with their summer. For eight weeks, at IBM\u2019s offices in White Plains, N.Y. (a half-hour from Norwalk via school bus), they worked in IBM\u2019s digital sales team. They used the company\u2019s Watson Language Translator, an artificial intelligence tool, to translate sales documents for IBM employees around the world.\n\nBianca Velez and Christian Tapper, both P-TECH students, take classes at Norwalk Community College. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cInstead of translating word for word like Google Translate, it looks at a document holistically,\u201d Tayjasanant explained, his polished presentation reflecting the public-speaking element in P-TECH\u2019s curriculum. \u201cIt\u2019s able to keep the tone, able to keep the diction, the nuances to language that are so important.\u201d\n\nVelez and Tayjasanant have each taken seven college courses already. They\u2019re on track to graduate next spring, in four years instead of six, with associate\u2019s degrees as well as high school diplomas. At first, says Velez, \u201cthe personal draw to me was, obviously, free college.\u201d Then she embraced P-TECH Norwalk\u2019s path toward an associate\u2019s degree in web development. \u201cI\u2019m really into things like design. I was thinking, maybe learning how to code and design websites was something I would really like to do.\u201d Now she knows she likes coding websites, but she\u2019s also considering careers in chemistry or chemical engineering, attending a four-year college, and working with IBM.\n\nVelez\u2019s mother, Annette Velez, says P-TECH, especially its college classes and public-speaking course, have helped her daughter grow as a student. \u201cShe was a very timid child,\u201d she recalls. \u201cNow she\u2019s very open, loves talking, sharing ideas.\u201d\n\nKaren Amaker, principal of Norwalk High School, in a P-TECH web design class. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nKaren Amaker, has been the principal at P-TECH Norwalk since 2014, when it was founded as Norwalk Early College Academy and adopted the P-TECH curriculum. She says the model works for students like Velez and Tayjasanant\u2014\u201cour high flyers who are on that fast track\u201d\u2014 and for the typical P-TECH student, who completes the program in 5\u00bd to six years. \u201cFor those families for whom college wasn\u2019t necessarily in their plan\u2014not because they didn\u2019t want it, because they didn\u2019t see it as accessible\u2014I think P-TECH makes that accessibility and opportunity very much visible.\u201d Most P-TECH Norwalk students go on to pursue a four-year degree, Amaker says, and some choose careers outside tech. For instance, a recent graduate, accepted into the Rhode Island School of Design, didn\u2019t finish the associate\u2019s degree, but transferred her college credits to her new school.\n\nThe Norwalk school, one of four P-TECH schools in Connecticut, launched with state funding. When that dried up after a year, Norwalk Community College\u2019s then-president used discretionary funds to pay for the students\u2019 free college courses. Now P-TECH receives an extra $1,000 per pupil from the Norwalk school district to help cover the cost. Pell grants also help, as does federal funding from the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest mistakes I\u2019ve seen in education is this trend to do away with technical skills,\u201d Amaker says. Instead, she says, schools need to \u201chelp students to develop those skills, be that auto mechanics, computer science, [or] now culinary arts, and all the things in between. We have to move away from this cookie-cutter model of doing education as rote memorization and really think about project-based learning and design thinking.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Education", "description": "With schools across 10 states, the P-TECH program prepares its students for good jobs that corporations pay well for.", "authors": ["Shawna Chen", "Erick Trickey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a1/83/34b8d32c4de6a20cff0fb7d1ccdb/trickey-lede.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
