But, because of Brexit, decades of seafaring could soon come to an abrupt end.\n\nBenoit Beernaert, the owner of the Mare Nostrum trawler, makes half his annual catch in UK waters. And nobody knows whether his boat can continue to fish those seas after 31 October.\n\n\u201cIf I lose half my fishing ground why should I invest? It could be better to finish,\u201d he said. Feelings don\u2019t come into it: \u201cI would finish, rather than go bankrupt. It\u2019s a rational decision, it\u2019s not an emotional decision.\u201d\n\nThe uncertain future of Mare Nostrum (Latin for \u201cour sea\u201d) is a microcosm of the threat facing Belgium\u2019s 65-strong fishing fleet, which also catches half its fish in UK waters.\n\nAdding to the anxiety is the sharper tone from London, after the arrival of Boris Johnson as prime minister, who has pledged \u201cdo or die\u201d to quit the EU on 31 October.\n\n\u201cWe feel that in Downing Street there is a hardline government,\u201d Beernaert said. No-deal Brexit was \u201cthe most disturbing issue of all: there is no clear or clean answer\u201d.\n\nThe mess room of the Mare Nostrum, moored at the Belgian port of Zeebrugge for engine maintenance, is a snug, spare wooden space, with formica tables where the crew of six eat their meals at sea. The Mare Nostrum and its staff spend half the year in British waters. The ship cannot fish inside the UK\u2019s 12-mile exclusive economic zone, so it never gets too close.\n\nThirty-five species including sole, brill, ray, cod and haddock are trawled from the seabed, gutted on a deckside conveyor belt, and packed in ice-laden crates in the zero-degree chill of the fish hold.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benoit Beernaert will be heading to Danish waters instead of British ones from November.\n\nWith its 67km strip of blustery coastline along the North Sea, Belgium has one of the EU\u2019s smallest fishing fleets, but is proud of its seafaring tradition. Flemish fishermen have been hunting these seas, long before the state of Belgium was created in 1830.\n\nEmiel Brouckaert is the chief executive of Rederscentrale, the Belgian fishing industry organisation. During the second world war, his grandfather \u2013 like Beernaert\u2019s \u2013 came to England as a refugee, and settled in the Devon fishing town of Brixham. As fishing was a reserved occupation, the Belgians fished the surrounding waters to put food on the country\u2019s tables.\n\n\u201cThe future of fisheries in the UK and in Belgium will always remain intertwined,\u201d Brouckaert said. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, he believes it would not take long before talks resume about reciprocal fishing rights.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a form of cooperation, there needs to be a form of reciprocal access,\u201d he said.\n\nYet fishing is one area in which the EU stands to lose more from Brexit than the UK. Under the common fisheries policy, EU-based fleets land about eight times as much fish in UK waters as British fishermen do in EU waters \u2013 a \u201cpoor deal\u201d says the UK government, which has promised to overhaul the current system.\n\nThe politically-charged topic is also being deployed by Westminster, as it bids to re-open the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Ministers urging Brussels to rethink its refusal to renegotiate the exit deal have cited the Belgian fishing industry as one example of how the EU will be damaged by a no-deal Brexit.\n\nFishing industry groups around the North Sea are aware of the threat. Soon after the 2016 referendum, they formed a special lobby group to speak for their interests, the European Fisheries Alliance (Eufa).\n\n\u201cWe are more dependent on UK waters than vice versa,\u201d said Gerard van Balsfoort, the chair of Eufa, who called suggestions that British fishermen had got a bad deal in the fish quota negotiations of the 1970s and 80s \u201ca myth\u201d.\n\nEufa estimates that failure to reach a long-term deal on reciprocal fishing rights would cost 6,000 jobs in catching, processing and selling fish in the participating countries. While that could devastate coastal villages, fishing is a small part of the EU economy, raising concerns it could get sidelined in Brexit talks. \u201cWe are a relatively small sector compared to chemicals, IT, so we didn\u2019t want to be a pawn in any negotiation,\u201d Van Balsfoort said.\n\nThe message has hit home. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called fishing rights a \u201clever\u201d to ensure the EU gets what it wants from the future trading relationship. The EU\u2019s 2018 guidelines for negotiating a trade deal spell out that zero-tariffs on goods should be tied to maintaining current access to waters \u2013 an opening bid deemed outrageous by British negotiators.\n\nEurope\u2019s dependence on British waters is balanced by the UK\u2019s desire to sell seafood to the EU. Two thirds of fish caught by British boats \u2013 often valuable seafood, such as prawns, mussels and lobsters \u2013 are exported to EU countries. If the British fishing industry is going to thrive, it needs continued access to those markets.\n\nFrom November, the Mare Nostrum will not be sailing the Channel for its usual autumn voyage. Beernaert will instead head to Danish waters.\n\n\u201cWe have been thinking for the last two or three years whether we could have other fishing grounds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut where else do you go? There is no possibility left.\u201d", "description": "Amid prolonged political wrangling, families fishing in UK waters for decades are forced to reassess", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/619b655ecf7c7735a35389e4fb1d7ea09f9bbac2/0_283_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=851d231f84c2a484adeeed8a48c64e13", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
