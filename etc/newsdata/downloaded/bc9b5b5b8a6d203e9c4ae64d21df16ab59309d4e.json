Prosecutors argued they should serve half their time before having such privileges.\n\nAll nine were found guilty of sedition in their efforts to break Catalonia, an autonomous community in northeastern Spain, away and become its own state \u2014 but none were convicted of rebellion, the most serious of the charges they faced. Three others were found guilty of disobedience but will not serve prison time.\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court said the nine were involved in \u201cundeniable\u201d acts of violence in connection with Catalonia\u2019s efforts to declare independence from Spain, but none rose to the level of rebellion. The trial included testimony from more than 400 witnesses.\n\nOriol Junqueras, leader of the Catalan Republican Left party, faces the greatest prison term, 13 years. After receiving his sentence, Junqueras said Catalan independence was \u201ccloser than ever.\u201d\n\nDefense attorneys said they will appeal to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Some of the defendants have called for a referendum for Catalan independence.\n\nSix former government officials, including premier Carlos Puigdemont, have left the country and have not faced any charges in court related to their months-long attempts to secede from Spain.\n\n\u201cA total of 100 years of prison. How horrible. Now more than ever, we will be with you and your families,\u201d Puigdemont tweeted Monday. \u201cFor the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish Supreme Court is expected in the coming months to reactivate an international arrest warrant for Puigdemont and the other Catalan leaders who escaped prosecution.", "description": "Oct. 14 (UPI) \u2014 The Spanish Supreme Court sentenced nine Catalan separatists to several years in prison Monday stemming from government attempts to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
