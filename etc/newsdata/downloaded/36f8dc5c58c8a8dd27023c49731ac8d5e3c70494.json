For years we\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s on its way out, but who among us has not found an errant Flash video or widget in the last month or two? To hasten its demise Google is taking the understandable step of\u2026 pretending it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nYes, Google Search will stop indexing Flash content starting later this year. Why was it even doing so today, years after any sane webmaster stopped using it? Well, there\u2019s a lot of legacy content out there. Probably Google wanted to give the long tail a chance to curl up.\n\nDeindexing Flash doesn\u2019t mean if you have website that serves it, it\u2019ll be ignored entirely. But any information accessed through that Flash container, like a storefront, video description, game, or what have you will be skipped over by Google\u2019s crawlers.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re honest, you\u2019ll probably get demoted pretty hard by the algorithm too.\n\nMost people probably won\u2019t notice any change, partly because Flash-serving websites aren\u2019t often very high on the list anyway, and of course the major browsers all block Flash by default. Even Adobe is giving it up.\n\nIf you want to play some of those old Flash games, and really some of them were pretty awesome, you\u2019ll still be able to find them if you search directly for them \u2014 there are sites collecting them that will want to show up for Google and as such will work to appear prominently in search results for things like \u201ccool old flash games\u201d and the like.\n\nSo is Flash dead now? Probably not, but I wouldn\u2019t call what it\u2019s doing living, either. Still, I imagine we\u2019ll get a few more uses out of that top image.", "description": "The death of Flash has been a long time coming... and a long time going on, too.
