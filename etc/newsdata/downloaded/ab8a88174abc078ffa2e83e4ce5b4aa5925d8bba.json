His try and two conversions played a crucial part in driving the Welsh fightback after a Jacob Stockdale double and penalty try had put the visitors ahead.\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt Rhys came on and did a good job,\u201d Gatland added. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot easier coming on off the bench with no pressure on you. He scored tries, kicked well, so he\u2019s done well. And it\u2019s hard for Jarrod if the team isn\u2019t going as well as it could. So [you\u2019ve] got to put those things into perspective.\u201d\n\nGatland is also confident that he\u2019ll be taking his strongest-ever squad to a World Cup, having overseen two previous campaigns as head coach of the Welsh national side \u2013 both of which ended in disappointment.\n\nWhen asked if this would be best set of players at a World Cup, he said: \u201cI think so, yes.\n\n\u201cThe pleasing thing about these guys is that they showed some great character. They showed what it means to play for Wales. They were disappointed with the first half. They can take a lot of pride out of the fact they didn\u2019t give up, they kept on trying \u2026 we were pretty positive towards the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat team will be a lot better for it.\u201d", "description": "Warren Gatland has said he \u201cgot what he wanted\u201d from Wales\u2019 World Cup warm-up clash with Ireland, despite seeing his side succumb to a 22-17 defeat at the Principality Stadium.
