This Wednesday, September 25, you can celebrate with all the crustaceans your heart desires, while maybe also telling the people you love they're your lobster. Ross Geller would certainly approve.\n\nWhile it may not be as widely celebrated as, say, the cookie days of the year, you better believe Red Lobster is joining the party. Come Wednesday, the restaurant is offering a 1 1/4 pound lobster deal for $19.99. Right now, that amount of lobster costs $36.49 at New York City locations (price can vary by location/season), which means NY diners are saving more than fifteen bucks. Not bad for a seafood dinner!\n\nTo note, the offer is available while supplies last, so you probably don't want to show up just before closing time in case the lobster sells out.\n\nIn conjunction with the National Lobster Day celebration, Red Lobster is also unveiling a new Key Lime Pie recipe, since that national day is September 26. They've been serving Key Lime Pie for decades and thought it was time for a revamp, so they recreated the recipe with help from Tampa, FL bakery called Mike's Pies. It uses Nellie & Joe's Key Lime Juice, which is the good stuff used in Key West.\n\nIf you do partake in the lobster day festivities, grab a slice of the tart, creamy pie to go with your dinner. And if you're eating at the restaurant, you should probably order a Lobsterita too. When in Rome!!!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Bring in the dancing lobsters!!!", "authors": ["Madison Flager"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9.UmyUi5nUCHfGnl36nZMQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/delish_597/0591e690a6f80e9ad4cee229b5d8eebd", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
