We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nUnderground THC sales are risky. U.S. embrace of legalized pot may have to wait until consumers are confident the only thing in their weed is weed.\n\nOne of the unintended consequences of Prohibition during the 1920s was contamination. Hundreds of thousands were sickened and thousands died after drinking poisonous bootleg alcohol.\n\nIn a macabre twist on that history, one of the unintended consequences of marijuana legalization might be the new epidemic of lung illness associated with vaping bootleg cannabis oil. Six deaths have been linked to vaping,and hundreds of people have been sickened. Most have been teens and young adults. Most were vaping illegal THC oil.\n\nI have been covering the story of contaminated THC for The Marijuana Times since spring. The trail began in April with a $5 million cache of illegal cannabis vape cartridges seized by the sheriff of Mendocino County, California, in a region where the lion\u2019s share of theblack market cannabis consumed by Americans is grown and processed.\n\nWeed toxic enough to kill\n\nSheriff Thomas Allman decided on a hunch to have the oil tested. The lab reported it was contaminated with a stew of pesticides and a particular fungicide that, when heated to more than 400 degrees, breaks down to release deadly hydrogen cyanide. For that reason, it is banned for use on tobacco in the United States and \u2014 in Canada, Washington, Oregon and Colorado \u2014 on marijuana. According to the lab, the concentration of that fungicide \u2014 myclobutanil \u2014 in the batch Allman had tested was 7,300 times the limit set by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.\n\nVaping in Portland, Maine, Aug. 28, 2019.

I wondered at the time how many black market batches had escaped interception, and whether the oil in those cartridges was as dangerous as it sounded. The answer could be upon us, and David Kurzfeld may have a key piece of evidence.\n\nContaminated cannabis is Kurzfeld\u2019s bread and butter. He is one of four partners who own a highly specialized business in Willits, California. Modular Processing Systems cleans contaminated oil for licensed producers. Kurzfeld says some of the oil they have processed arrived so filthy with pesticides, fungicides and other toxins that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare get it on my skin, let alone vape it.\u201d\n\nResearch lagging:Doctors and patients are flying blind as medical marijuana use rises\n\nKurzfeld, a fourth-generation Mendocino rancher and farmer, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge out here that if a legit grower has weed that won\u2019t pass the state test for contaminants, they just sell it into the black market.\u201d\n\nThese growers might be callous, but even if they were mindful they\u2019d run into a paradox \u2014 you can\u2019t have your illegal marijuana tested in a state licensed lab if you don\u2019t have a state license to grow or handle marijuana.\n\nAs for the state inspectors responsible for monitoring such things on the ground, Kurzfeld says there are too few to even take reports about contamination, let alone investigate them: \u201cFor some reason they don\u2019t last long. They either quit or get fired.\u201d\n\nAmerica's pot experiment is failing\n\nWhile public health officials try to pinpoint the chemistry or mechanism causing vaping-associated pulmonary illness, it seems an appropriate moment to call out an inconvenient truth about marijuana legalization: America\u2019s noble pot experiment is failing miserably.\n\nAs the largest producer of cannabis in the country, California ought to be setting the standard for oversight. Instead, cheap black market cannabis is so abundant, and scofflaws so bold, that a Los Angeles Times investigation in June found that more than half of that city\u2019s 400 or so dispensaries were unlicensed pop-up shops, and that they proliferate faster than the police can shut them down. Less visible are the hundreds, if not thousands, of private delivery services and individual dealers of outlaw cannabis.\n\nVaping dangers:Unregulated vaping spawns new teenage nicotine addicts. And now adult vapers are dying.\n\nLegitimate growers, processors and retailers \u2014 with layers of regulatory and other expenses that make it impossible to compete on price \u2014 fume about lost sales. State officials in California and elsewhere who based their budgets on rosy predictions of marijuana tax revenue are scrambling to deal with shortfalls in the hundreds of millions. One study found that a dollar generated in cannabis taxes is far outweighed by health and other costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the black market is booming. New Frontier Data, which tracks cannabis sales and trends, estimated this spring that as much as 80% of the marijuana sold in California comes from the black market. In major urban markets like New York, the figure is certainly at least as high.\n\nRegulatory chaos breeds illegal market\n\nIn its 2018 annual report, the California Cannabis Advisory Committee cited \u201cfragmented and uncoordinated\u201d enforcement, which it said \u201cis creating a thriving environment for the unregulated 'underground market.' \u201d\n\nMultiply all that by 50. Because marijuana is still illegal by federal law, each state has had to legislate and build its own regulatory scheme, with all the idiosyncrasies involved with local politics. Now build a wall around each state, because transportation of THC across state lines is a federal crime. Finally, give each municipality in each state the right to just say no to having a dispensary within its borders. It is a regulatory nightmare \u2014 \u201ca s--t show,\u201d in the words of Miriam Carrero, director of the lab at Modular Processing Systems.\n\nHarris Damashek, until recently chief branding officer for one of the largest legitimate cannabis marketers \u2014 Acreage Holdings \u2014 described the challenge thus: \u201cImagine if, to create a bottle of Coke, in each state you had to grow the sugar cane and you couldn\u2019t use it in any other state; you had to process it within each state; you had to package it to meet each state\u2019s regulations; and so on. ... It\u2019s at least as complicated as the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d\n\nWhatever the outcome of efforts to pinpoint the cause of this outbreak, it seems likely that the national embrace of cannabis-as-medicine, which seemed so inevitable just two months ago, may have to wait until consumers feel confident that the only thing in their weed is weed.\n\nFoster Winans is the senior editor of The Marijuana Times.
