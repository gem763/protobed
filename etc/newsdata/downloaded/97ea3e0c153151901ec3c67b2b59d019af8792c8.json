It was their sixth 16-plus-point triumph in seven games, and they became the first team in modern NFL history to outscore their first seven opponents by more than 160 points.\n\nThe defense is operating at a historic pace\u2014that unit has surrendered just 4.3 points per game if you account for three defensive touchdowns by New England opponents\u2014and the offense has scored 30 or more points every week except one.\n\nAnd the Patriots humiliated a division rival Monday night, which they deserve credit for considering New York's recent performance against Dallas. Few expected the Jets to pull off another upset, but quarterback Sam Darnold posted the fifth-lowest single-game passer rating this decade as the Pats registered six takeaways and controlled the ball for more than 38 minutes.\n\nIt was the 12th-most-lopsided road victory in the NFL this century.\n\nBut the six opponents New England has crushed (including the Jets twice) are a combined 6-26. The only team they didn't beat handily\u2014the Buffalo Bills\u2014is 5-1. And they benefited from an injury to Bills quarterback Josh Allen as well as a special teams touchdown in that six-point victory.\n\nIf New England's early success has more to do with the quality of its opponents outside of Buffalo, the Pats could be in for a rude awakening in the weeks to come.\n\nAdam Hunger/Associated Press\n\nWeek 8, vs. Cleveland Browns: The Browns are only 2-4, but there's no denying they have talent. They'll be desperate, and they'll be coming off their bye week. That could make life difficult on the Patriots, who might be tempted to think about an impending trip to Baltimore.\n\nWeek 9, at Baltimore Ravens: Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has emerged as an MVP candidate and one of the league's toughest players to defend. If he's on his game at home in prime time, a team that will also be coming off its bye could give New England trouble. The Ravens have quietly won three in a row, and the defense looked rejuvenated in Marcus Peters' debut Sunday in Seattle.\n\nWeek 11, at Philadelphia Eagles: An experienced, talented and well-coached team could also be desperate at this point. It could also be healthier, and it'll also be coming off its bye. At least in this case, so will the Pats.\n\nWeek 12, vs. Dallas Cowboys: The defending NFC East champions again lead that division following a big win over Philadelphia. This could be a tough spot for Dallas following a game in Detroit, but nobody would be surprised if it hung with New England.\n\nWeek 13, at Houston Texans: The Texans played the Patriots tough in Foxborough last September, and quarterback Deshaun Watson has made progress since then. Houston is up and down, but when the Texans are in a groove, they're one of the toughest outs in the league. They're one week removed from a road win against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWeek 14, vs. Chiefs: ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Sunday that reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes could return from his knee injury \"in three weeks, if not sooner.\" That means the superstar quarterback should be fully healthy for a return to Foxborough. Last time he and the Chiefs were there, they put up 40 points in a three-point loss in Week 6 of the 2018 campaign.\n\nUncredited/Associated Press\n\nIt's far from ideal that the Patriots' next three opponents will be coming off bye weeks, and the juxtaposition between the quarterbacks New England has played (Ben Roethlisberger, Ryan Fitzpatrick/Josh Rosen, Luke Falk, Allen/Matt Barkley, Colt McCoy, Daniel Jones, Darnold) and the quarterbacks it's slated to play (Baker Mayfield, Jackson, Carson Wentz, Dak Prescott, Watson, Mahomes) is almost comical.\n\nA team that has been favored by more than a touchdown five times already this season won't likely lay that many points again until it visits the Cincinnati Bengals in mid-December before finishing up the regular season at home against the Bills and Dolphins.\n\nWill the Pats still be perfect at that point? Will the AFC East already be theirs? Buffalo's schedule is a little more forgiving, but a team that has been limited to 17 or fewer points in three of six games could have trouble sustaining things.\n\nSo, the Patriots are on track to easily secure another first-round bye. That's the luxury of playing in a bad division within the weaker of the two conferences.\n\nStill, how they perform in these next six games against teams that are a combined 23-18 will reveal if this is a contender that was enjoying a cakewalk start or an utterly dominant powerhouse that should be heavily favored to become the first repeat Super Bowl champion in 15 years.\n\nThe table has been set, and New England couldn't have done a better job setting it. But now it's go time.\n\nBrad Gagnon has covered the NFL for Bleacher Report since 2012.\n\nFollow @Brad_Gagnon", "description": "The New England Patriots have comfortably and definitively done everything asked of them in the 2019  NFL  season...", "authors": ["Brad Gagnon"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/834/375/hi-res-cf989c699fba19f7b0c7b0e6f86a61bc_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
