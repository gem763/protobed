Rams and Seattle. Late-running Sunday afternoon football also helped Fox.\n\nWith the ever-increasing number of people watching prime-time programs on a delayed basis, it inflates the importance of live events like football in the weekly ranking. But Fox also had strong showings from \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d and its drama, \u201c911,\u201d with a popular tsunami story line.\n\nNBC won the ratings race last week, and was a close second this week, Nielsen said.\n\nUnlike Fox and NBC, former long-time champ CBS doesn\u2019t have an NFL prime-time game. The network\u2019s \u201cNCIS\u201d was the week\u2019s most popular scripted show, while \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d was the favorite comedy.\n\nFox averaged 6.7 million viewers for the week, followed by NBC\u2019s 6.5 million, CBS at 6.2 million, ABC at 4.7 million, Univision with 1.3 million, ION Television had 1.2 million, Telemundo had 1.1 million and the CW had 790,000.\n\nESPN averaged 2.86 million viewers to be the most popular cable network for the week. Fox News Channel had 2.65 million, TBS had 2.51 million, MSNBC had 2.04 million and TLC had 1.07 million.\n\nABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d topped the evening newscasts with an average of 8.2 million viewers. NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d was second with 7.4 million and the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d had 5.2 million viewers.\n\nFor the week of Sept. 29-Oct. 6, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: NFL Football: Indianapolis at Kansas City, NBC, 18.13 million; \u201cNFL Postgame,\u201d Fox, 17.49 million; NFL Football: L.A.
