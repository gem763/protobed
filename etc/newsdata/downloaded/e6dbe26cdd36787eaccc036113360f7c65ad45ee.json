During a recent webcast, he revealed that the portfolio reduced its allocation of US stocks to 10% from 15% and lifted its cash holding to 15% from 10%. He said that was the largest share of cash he has allotted since 2011.\n\nWien remains confident as ever that the bull market is not on the brink of ending. However, the fact that the stock market has performed so well this year in the face of \"problematic circumstances\" is cause for concern.\n\n\"I have more optimism than you do, but I recognize the dangers that are lurking,\" Wien said to Joe Zidle, Blackstone's chief investment strategist and the cohost of the webcast. The firm oversees $545 billion in assets.\n\nRead more: Nobel laureate Robert Shiller forewarned investors about the dot-com and housing bubbles. Now he tells us which irrational market behaviors have him most worried.\n\nWien and Zidle then proceeded to walk their audience through some of these dangers on their radar.\n\nThe risk of a recession\n\nTop of their minds \u2014 and on the minds of many investors this year \u2014 is the risk of a US recession.\n\nOf the three primary indicators that Wien and Zidle track, two are flashing a recession signal. Leading economic indicators are deteriorating, while the yield curve between two- and 10-year Treasurys has inverted for the first time since the most recent recession. However, average hourly earnings growth is still above water.\n\n\"The yield curve is one that I consider to be most important,\" Zidle said. \"But I would note here it doesn't really take more than one of these indicators to trip a recession warning. Certainly, more than one becomes of a greater concern. But the yield curve is the one that I consider to be the most predictive.\"\n\nWien concurred that it was a concerning signal, though he had a slightly more optimistic take on the dreaded recession indicator.\n\nHe noted that the curve usually inverts because the Federal Reserve nudges short-term rates above longer-term ones. This time, however, it was long-term rates that fell below short-term rates because of an abundance of liquidity that investors parked in the bond market.\n\nThis dynamic suggests a recession may not happen as soon as the inversion implies, Wien said.\n\nBut that does not mean the coast is clear enough to be taking on more portfolio risk.\n\n\"We're now in optimistic territory, so the market can make some further progress,\" Wien said. \"But we're definitely not in the ideal position to be a heavy buyer \u2014 and that's one of the reasons we raised a little more cash for the radical asset allocation.\"\n\nThe shift from US stocks to cash was the only big change in the radical-asset-allocation portfolio. Beyond that, Wien continues to advice investors to seek yield in the fixed income and mortgage markets. And for individual investors, he says municipal bonds are still attractive.", "description": "The Blackstone vice chairman recommended other areas of the market beyond US stocks to find yield today.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/53d797ac6bb3f71264d9348d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
