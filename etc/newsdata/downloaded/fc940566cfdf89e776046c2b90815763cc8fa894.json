Too bad he can't talk about race without sounding like a Disney character", "language": "en", "text": "I appreciated what Pete Buttigieg said about his time in the military at the third Democratic presidential primary debate in Houston, Texas. The significance of a candidate who identifies as queer describing his experience as a Navy reserve officer during the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell policy\u201d can\u2019t be understated. For some watching at home, it may have very well meant the world to hear another gay man with Mayor Pete\u2019s profile confess that when it came to his choice of coming out, \u201cI had to wonder if just acknowledging who I was, was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback.\u201c\n\nBut, for a man now trying to bill himself as both a generational alternative to Joe Biden and a more moderate and purportedly more \u201cunifying\u201d figure than progressive candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, when it came to the issue of race, Buttigieg sounded just about as antiquated as some of the older white moderates he shared the stage with.\n\nI suppose some would say that Buttigieg deserves credit for saying that anyone who supports President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and rhetoric is supporting racism, but I wouldn\u2019t, because to me it\u2019s obvious. And no, Buttigieg doesn\u2019t get bonus points either for communicating his message in Spanish (\u201cEs racismo y es sencillo\u201c). Certainly not when he follows with the rather banal observation that \u201dthe only people who actually buy into this hateful rhetoric against immigrants are people who don't know any.\u201c\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Donald Trump has seen all types of people all his life, and he still says racist things.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s line derives from the school of thought that proximity to diverse groups begets less racist attitudes from white people. If only we were all a little closer, things would be easier! Unfortunately, that wonderful-sounding theory really doesn\u2019t check out. New York didn\u2019t just give us Donald Trump; it also gave us Rudy Guiliani. Buttigieg is a millennial, so at this point, he ought to know better by now.\n\nButtigieg wasn\u2019t the worst on race, though.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Worse, Klobuchar continues to tout her white moderate Midwestern appeal while continuously overlooking the reality that the Midwest includes cities like Detroit, Flint, Cleveland, Milwaukee, St Louis, Chicago \u2014 places which are not white and moderate, but are very much needed to win a presidential election.\n\nStill, not being the worst offender doesn\u2019t make Buttigieg\u2019s remarks any less, uh, goofy.\n\nIn fact, his comments about Trump supporters supporting racism last night are a deviation from more favorable comments made about them earlier in the year.\n\nIn an interview with USA Today published in April, Buttigieg said of Trump voters: \u201cWell, I think it starts with a certain amount of humility and recognizing that how you voted doesn\u2019t make you a good person or a bad person, and we shouldn\u2019t think of ourselves as better human beings because of how we voted.\u201d\n\nButtigieg did acknowledge his Douglass Plan, which he has previously said would help dismantle racist systems and structures. Yet, the plan comes in the wake of criticism of his handling of the South Bend Police Department. Buttigieg needs the support of black voters to have an actual chance of winning the nomination, so strategically, he has to appeal to us. So here\u2019s a tip: sound less like a Disney character when addressing American bigotry.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke may be nearly a decade older than Pete Buttigieg, but when it comes to how to talk about racism in this country and how to handle it, he sounded miles more progressive than his millennial counterpart. The former Texas congressman called Trump a white supremacist, noted racism is \u201cendemic to our country,\u201d and promised to sign Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee\u2019s reparations bill into law.\n\nFunny enough, at one point, Buttigieg told another candidate who answers questions about racism better than he does, Juli\u00e1n Castro, \u201cThis is why Presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. It reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. Scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each that \u2018my plan, your plan.\u2019\u201d\n\nCastro interrupted him by saying, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called a Democratic primary election. That\u2019s an election.\u201d\n\nButtigieg may not have liked Castro\u2019s tone all night, but when it comes to reasons why presidential debates can be unwatchable, he might want to consider his own banal and detached musings about racism in this country first before casting judgment on the competition.", "description": "I appreciated what Pete Buttigieg said about his time in the military at the third Democratic presidential primary debate in Houston, Texas.
