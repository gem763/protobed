One fan tweeted she was \u201coffended on Adele\u2019s behalf\u201d, while another asked: \u201cDoes Adele know that Donald Trump plays her songs at his rallies? I have a feeling she would not be pleased.\u201d\n\nThe property tycoon, who is known to millions of Americans through the US version of The Apprentice, annoyed many Adele fans when he jumped the queue at a concert she gave at the Radio City Music Hall in November.\n\nMatt Bellassai (@MattBellassai) I can't believe Donald Trump got to walk right into the Adele concert and I'm still waiting in line @Adele fix it\n\nNow the singer has become the latest pop star to tell Trump to stop pinching her tunes for his campaign.\n\n\u201cAdele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning,\u201d her spokesman said.\n\nThat should come as no surprise to the Trump campaign. In 2011, Adele called David Cameron \u201ca wally\u201d, describing herself as a \u201cLabour girl through and through\u201d.\n\nNeil Young and the Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler have also told Trump to stop using their music. Attorneys for Tyler sent a cease and desist letter to Trump\u2019s campaign committee, which said Trump did \u201cnot have our client\u2019s permission to use Dream On\u201d or any of Tyler\u2019s other songs and that it \u201cgives the false impression that he is connected with, or endorses, Mr Trump\u2019s presidential bid\u201d.\n\nREM\u2019s Michael Stipe used more forthright language: \u201cGo fuck yourselves, the lot of you \u2013 you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign,\u201d he said in a statement after Trump used It\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It (and I Feel Fine) at a rally.\n\nBut Steve Gordon, an entertainment lawyer and author of The Future of the Music Business, told the Guardian that in the US artists cannot do much to stop candidates playing their music.\n\nEssentially, to play a recording of a song a political event the promoter simply gets a license from a licensing agent (either ASCAP, BMI or SESAC).\n\nBecause of US federal government laws, the licensing agent cannot deny a license to anyone who applies.\n\nThere are three things artists regularly try to sue for when their songs appear somewhere they don\u2019t want, said Gordon: trademark infringement, right of publicity and unfair trade practises.\n\n\u201cIf I, as a reasonable person, at a Trump or [Mike] Huckabee rally where Adele was played thought that Adele was endorsing the campaign she should have a cause of action,\u201d said Gordon.\n\nBut Gordon added that simply playing a recording of a song did not count as a sufficient endorsement.\n\nPlus, Adele declaring that she \u201chas not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning\u201d means that it\u2019s even clearer to voters that she did not support him.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s coming out publicly against using her music, then she\u2019s not endorsing him so no one would think she was. If I was his lawyer, he\u2019s got a strong case, and she\u2019s got a BS claim. If they tried to do anything legally \u2026 at the end of the day, she\u2019d lose,\u201d said Gordon.\n\nWas there anything artists could do to make sure someone with completely different political views to them stays away from their music?\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Gordon.", "description": "Record-breaking star joins long list of musicians \u2013 including Neil Young, REM and Aerosmith \u2013 who have asked presidential hopeful to leave their songs alone", "authors": ["Mark Tran", "Amber Jamieson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a180ca68a3a1f2c54aa587aa56ec07bd7938cf0e/0_199_2514_1511/master/2514.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e91fb301f67f3aa54665e666a100a79c", "published_at": "2016-02-01"}
