Men there die a full seven years earlier than their counterparts in other UK cities. Until recently, the causes of this excess mortality remained a mystery.\n\nThe phenomenon has become known as the Glasgow Effect. But David Walsh, a public health programme manager at the Glasgow Centre for Population Health, who led a study on the excess deaths in 2010, wasn\u2019t satisfied with how the term was being used. \u201cIt turned into a Scooby-Doo mystery but it\u2019s not an exciting thing. It\u2019s about people dying young, it\u2019s about grief.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to work out why Glaswegians have a 30% higher risk of dying prematurely \u2013 that is before the age of 65 \u2013 than those living in similar post-industrial British cities. In 2016 his team published a report looking at 40 hypotheses \u2013 from vitamin D deficiency to obesity and sectarianism. \u201cThe most important reason is high levels of poverty, full stop,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cThere\u2019s one in three children who are classed as living in poverty at the moment.\u201d\n\nBut even with deprivation accounted for, mortality rates in Glasgow remained inexplicable. Deaths in each income group are about 15% higher than in Manchester or Liverpool. In particular, deaths from \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d \u2013 drug overdoses, suicides and alcohol-related deaths \u2013 are high. In the mid-2000s, after adjusting for sex, age and deprivation, there was almost a 70% higher mortality rate for suicide in Glasgow than in the two English cities.\n\nWalsh\u2019s report revealed that radical urban planning decisions from the 1950s onwards had made the physical and mental health of Glasgow\u2019s population more vulnerable to the consequences of deindustrialisation and poverty.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nShifting theories of city planning have profoundly altered people\u2019s lives everywhere, and particularly over the past half-century in Glasgow. The city\u2019s population stands at about 600,000 now. In 1951, it was nearly double this. Glasgow\u2019s excess mortality, the report suggests, is the unintended legacy of urban planning that exacerbated the already considerable challenges of living in a city.\n\nStudies have consistently linked city living with poorer mental health. For example, growing up in an urban environment is correlated with twice the risk of developing schizophrenia as growing up in the countryside. By 2050, 68% of the world\u2019s population will live in cities, according to UN figures. The consequences for global health are likely to be significant.\n\nCan we learn from what happened in Glasgow? As an increasing number of people move to or are born in cities, questions of fragmented communities, transient populations, overcrowding, inequality and segregation \u2013 and how these affect the wellbeing of residents \u2013 will become more acute.\n\nAre urban dwellers doomed to poor mental health or can planners learn from the mistakes of the past and design cities that will keep us healthy and happy?", "description": "Glasgow is notorious for the same ills that plague city dwellers everywhere. Is urban life itself harmful to humans \u2013 or can we rethink cities so that they can help us to thrive?", "authors": ["Fleur Macdonald"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/9y/p07r9y6x.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
