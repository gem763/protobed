Mark Dayton and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges expressed less enthusiasm at the prospect than their peers elsewhere. Dayton said the state\u2019s bid for Amazon, due Oct. 19, would be \u201crestrained\u201d and both leaders cited conversations with Target and Best Buy, who together employ about 20,000 people at headquarters in the Twin Cities.\n\nSome executives said Wednesday that they fear the deference to those companies shows that officials are more concerned about the state\u2019s present than its future.\n\n\u201cUnrestrained isn\u2019t wise with taxpayer dollars, but I hope we are not holding back due to the current incumbents,\u201d said John Tedesco, chief executive of Leadpages, one of the most successful startups in Minneapolis this decade. \u201cThe city has to continue to evolve and the companies that come here have to continue to evolve.\u201d\n\nTwin Cities Pioneer Press: Minnesotans\u2019 incomes are up, poverty is down, but successes remain uneven\n\nFollowing a national trend, Minnesota families in 2016 had more money in their pockets, were less likely to be poor and were more likely to have health insurance, data released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau show.\n\nYet those successes were not felt equally. Large gaps remain between the income, poverty and insurance rates of many Minnesotans of color and their white neighbors.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s median household income rose 3.3 percent between 2015 and 2016 to $65,599, the census found. Asian and white households had the highest incomes, while Hispanic, American Indian and black families earned considerably less.\n\nBlack households did see a 10 percent increase in income over 2015 but still earned just $33,436, or roughly half of the state\u2019s median household income.\n\nMinnesota Post: Minneapolis\u2019 Hodges uses city budget address to tout efforts on police reform, housing, and Trump\n\nIncumbents running for re-election have some unique handicaps, and being a target is one of them. Challengers can criticize while offering only generalized examples of what they might do differently.\n\nIn the 2017 Minneapolis mayoral race, Betsy Hodges has certainly experienced that from her 15 opponents, some more than others.\n\nBut incumbents running for re-election also have some unique advantages. Mayors get to be mayor \u2014 with all of the attention and standing that brings. Hodges\u2019 challengers rarely get the full attention of media coverage when they make pronouncements, and they don\u2019t get to deliver their remarks amid the trappings of the office.\n\nHodges took full advantage of that on Tuesday, when she delivered her fourth Minneapolis city budget address in City Council chambers. In a speech that came a month after the city charter says it should have \u2014but also a month closer to election day \u2014 the 45-minute address both bragged about her accomplishments and promised to continue to work on a list of priorities: equity, cultural change in the police department, addressing a housing affordability problem and establishing cities like Minneapolis as a fighter of climate change.", "description": "Minneapolis StarTribune:\u00a0Some business leaders protest \u2018restrained\u2019 approach to Amazon bid\nTarget .09/02/2019 3:19:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
