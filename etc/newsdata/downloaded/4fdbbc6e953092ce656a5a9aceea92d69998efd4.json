(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cCoeur\u201d) (NYSE: CDE) today announced third quarter 2019 production of 99,782 ounces of gold, 3.0 million ounces of silver, 4.2 million pounds of zinc and 4.5 million pounds of lead. Metal sales for the quarter totaled 100,407 ounces of gold, 3.0 million ounces of silver, 4.1 million pounds of zinc and 4.3 million pounds of lead.\n\nThe Company is reaffirming full-year 2019 production guidance of 334,000 \u2013 372,000 ounces of gold, 12.2 \u2013 14.7 million ounces of silver, 25 \u2013 40 million pounds of zinc and 20 \u2013 35 million pounds of lead.\n\nQuarterly Production Results\n\n\u201cAs anticipated, our third quarter operational results reflected the beginning of a strong second half that is expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year,\u201d said Mitchell J. Krebs, Coeur\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWharf bounced back from a slow first half to deliver a strong quarter, while Palmarejo and Kensington generated solid operational results to help drive a 15% quarter-over-quarter increase in Companywide gold production. At Rochester, we are beginning to see initial results from the newly-installed high-pressure grinding roll (\u201cHPGR\u201d) unit that are consistent with third-party test work and our internal expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Silvertip, quarterly production rates declined as we took advantage of favorable weather to extend planned downtime to complete several key surface projects. Additionally, we bolstered the internal and external resources at site to address remaining mill projects that will allow for a higher and more sustained level of mill availability,\u201d continued Mr. Krebs. \u201cOverall, we expect to achieve production guidance at each of our operations with the Companywide goal of returning to positive free cash flow in 2019.\u201d\n\nOperations\n\nThird quarter production and sales highlights for each of Coeur\u2019s operations are provided below.\n\nPalmarejo, Mexico\n\n3Q 2019 2Q 2019 1Q 2019 4Q 2018 3Q 2018 Tons milled 442,464 447,727 378,987 378,389 300,116 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.09 0.07 0.07 0.08 0.10 Average silver grade (oz/t) 4.88 4.74 4.64 5.96 6.26 Average recovery rate \u2013 Au 81.7% 87.7% 83.4% 97.6% 88.8% Average recovery rate \u2013 Ag 79.6% 81.8% 72.8% 84.0% 82.2% Ounces Produced Gold 31,779 28,246 23,205 31,239 27,885 Silver (000\u2019s) 1,720 1,735 1,278 1,893 1,544 Ounces Sold Gold 32,731 28,027 27,394 23,667 29,830 Silver (000\u2019s) 1,747 1,709 1,405 1,534 1,572 Average realized price per gold ounce $1,269 $1,210 $1,154 $1,148 $1,082 Average realized price per silver ounce $17.05 $14.86 $15.39 $14.57 $14.75\n\nThird quarter gold production increased 13% to 31,779 ounces, while silver production remained consistent at approximately 1.7 million ounces compared to the prior quarter. Year-over-year, gold and silver production increased by approximately 14% and 11%, respectively\n\nHigher gold production during the quarter was primarily driven by the improvement in average grade, partially offset by lower recoveries. Consistent quarter-over-quarter silver production reflected higher grade offset by slightly lower recoveries and mill throughput. Lower recoveries during the quarter reflect additional in-circuit inventory and adjustments on final settlements of dor\u00e9 sales\n\nProduction began at La Naci\u00f3n, located within the Independencia mine complex, in the beginning of the third quarter. La Naci\u00f3n is anticipated to continue ramping up through the end of 2019 as infrastructure projects are completed, adding approximately 400 tons per day of additional mill feed\n\nCommissioning of a new thickener was completed on-budget and on-schedule in the third quarter. The project is expected to increase metallurgical recoveries for both gold and silver by approximately 2% and has an estimated one-year payback\n\nApproximately 33% of gold sales in the third quarter, or 10,785 ounces, were sold under Palmarejo\u2019s gold stream agreement at a price of $800 per ounce. Full-year gold sales under the stream agreement are expected to remain around similar levels\n\nFull-year 2019 production guidance remains unchanged at 95,000 \u2013 105,000 ounces of gold and 6.5 \u2013 7.2 million ounces of silver\n\nRochester, Nevada\n\n3Q 2019 2Q 2019 1Q 2019 4Q 2018 3Q 2018 Tons placed 2,516,353 2,786,287 2,667,559 3,674,566 4,061,082 Average silver grade (oz/t) 0.43 0.45 0.46 0.46 0.52 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.004 0.003 0.003 0.004 0.004 Ounces Produced Silver (000\u2019s) 982 971 960 1,466 1,290 Gold 7,901 8,609 8,256 15,926 14,702 Ounces Sold Silver (000\u2019s) 951 962 1,000 1,391 1,248 Gold 7,651 8,642 8,511 15,339 14,257 Average realized price per silver ounce $17.02 $14.83 $15.31 $14.53 $14.70 Average realized price per gold ounce $1,476 $1,295 $1,299 $1,234 $1,204\n\nTons placed in the third quarter decreased 10% quarter-over-quarter and 38% year-over-year to approximately 2.5 million tons. Fewer tons placed reflects the commissioning of the new three-stage crushing circuit during the quarter\n\nSilver production remained consistent quarter-over-quarter at approximately 1.0 million ounces, while gold production decreased 8% to 7,901 ounces. Year-over-year, silver and gold production decreased 24% and 46%, respectively\n\nSilver production was impacted by slightly lower average grade, while gold production decreased largely due to fewer tons placed. Side slope leaching on the Stage III and Stage IV leach pads as well as the stacking of run-of-mine material early in the quarter were used to supplement production\n\nInitial recovery results from bottle roll and column tests on HPGR-crushed ore observed during the quarter were encouraging and in-line with original expectations. The Company plans to continue monitoring and benchmarking results against third-party test work to further validate recovery rates associated with the HPGR unit\n\nProduction in the fourth quarter is anticipated to benefit from the stacking of additional tons, reflecting a full quarter integrating the new crushing circuit. The Company began stacking HPGR-crushed material close to the liner of the Stage IV leach pad in September, with breakthrough expected later this month. Additional run-of-mine material may be used opportunistically to supplement production through the remainder of 2019\n\nCoeur is maintaining full-year 2019 production guidance of 4.2 \u2013 5.0 million ounces of silver and 40,000 \u2013 50,000 ounces of gold\n\nKensington, Alaska\n\n3Q 2019 2Q 2019 1Q 2019 4Q 2018 3Q 2018 Tons milled 166,475 160,510 164,332 166,310 167,964 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.22 0.23 0.20 0.23 0.17 Average recovery rate 93.2% 93.0% 90.2% 93.0% 91.8% Gold ounces produced 34,156 34,049 29,973 35,335 26,809 Gold ounces sold 35,452 34,415 31,335 33,202 25,648 Average realized price per gold ounce $1,485 $1,312 $1,286 $1,246 $1,161\n\nCommercial production at Jualin was declared on December 1, 2018. The figures shown in the table above include pre-commercial production\n\nContinued strong gold production during the third quarter totaled 34,156 ounces, consistent with the prior period. Year-over-year gold production increased 27%\n\nJualin accounted for approximately 15% of Kensington\u2019s third quarter production, compared to approximately 17% in the prior quarter. Jualin is now anticipated to account for approximately 15% of Kensington\u2019s total production in 2019, largely due to an expected increase in production from the Kensington Main deposit\n\nDuring the quarter, 9,784 ounces were sold under Kensington\u2019s $25.0 million prepayment agreement. Coeur anticipates a working capital outflow of approximately $15.0 million associated with these sales in the third quarter and expects the remaining $10.0 million working capital outflow during the fourth quarter\n\nFull-year 2019 production guidance is unchanged at 117,000 \u2013 130,000 ounces of gold\n\nWharf, South Dakota\n\n3Q 2019 2Q 2019 1Q 2019 4Q 2018 3Q 2018 Tons placed 1,503,021 919,435 1,090,510 1,644,168 1,127,391 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.027 0.023 0.020 0.020 0.023 Ounces produced Gold 25,946 15,680 16,902 16,960 19,437 Silver (000\u2019s) 18 12 13 13 13 Ounces sold Gold 24,573 15,301 18,086 15,306 19,874 Silver (000\u2019s) 17 12 14 11 12 Average realized price per gold ounce $1,481 $1,311 $1,317 $1,247 $1,198\n\nGold production in the third quarter increased 65% quarter-over-quarter and 33% year-over-year to 25,946 ounces\n\nHigher production during the quarter was largely driven by the placement of additional tons and improved grade. Tons placed increased 63% quarter-over-quarter to 1.5 million, while average gold grade increased 17% to 0.027 ounces per ton\n\nOperational results reflect better crusher performance and improved weather conditions. Strong crusher performance and the placement of higher-grade ore are expected to drive solid production results in the fourth quarter\n\nThe Company is maintaining full-year 2019 production guidance of 82,000 \u2013 87,000 ounces of gold\n\nSilvertip, British Columbia\n\n3Q 2019 2Q 2019 1Q 2019 4Q 2018 3Q 2018 Tons milled 53,145 59,689 62,051 38,802 28,080 Average silver grade (oz/t) 7.54 7.48 5.50 6.06 7.29 Average zinc grade (%) 7.6% 7.5% 5.9% 5.8% 8.0% Average lead grade (%) 5.4% 5.4% 3.7% 3.9% 4.6% Average recovery rate \u2013 Ag 74.8% 77.0% 69.9% 60.5% 47.0% Average recovery rate \u2013 Zn 51.7% 59.1% 50.5% 69.1% 49.1% Average recovery rate \u2013 Pb 78.4% 77.3% 66.8% 54.7% 44.4% Produced Silver (000\u2019s ounces) 300 344 239 142 96 Zinc (000\u2019s lbs) 4,197 5,322 3,719 3,083 2,207 Lead (000\u2019s lbs) 4,478 4,980 3,077 1,658 1,159 Sold Silver (000\u2019s ounces) 290 365 215 127 131 Zinc (000\u2019s lbs) 4,076 5,303 4,723 2,552 1,772 Lead (000\u2019s lbs) 4,331 5,186 2,748 1,444 1,645 Average realized price per silver ounce, gross $19.94 $15.18 $14.98 $15.54 $14.62 Treatment and refining charges per silver ounce $1.63 $1.18 $1.24 $1.38 $3.34 Average realized price per silver ounce, net $18.31 $14.00 $13.74 $14.16 $11.28 Average realized price per zinc pound, gross $0.82 $0.83 $1.50 $1.07 $1.20 Treatment and refining charges per zinc pound $0.35 $0.34 $0.31 $0.24 $0.27 Average realized price per zinc pound, net $0.47 $0.49 $1.19 $0.83 $0.93 Average realized price per lead pound, gross $1.02 $0.87 $0.92 $0.87 $0.97 Treatment and refining charges per lead pound $0.07 $0.05 $0.06 $0.07 $0.07 Average realized price per lead pound, net $0.95 $0.82 $0.86 $0.80 $0.90\n\nSilvertip achieved commercial production on September 1, 2018. The figures shown in the above table include pre-commercial production\n\nThird quarter silver production decreased 13% to 0.3 million ounces quarter-over-quarter, while zinc and lead production decreased 21% and 10%, respectively, to 4.2 million pounds of zinc and 4.5 million pounds of lead. Lower production was largely driven by planned and unplanned downtime, which impacted mill availability during the quarter\n\nPlanned downtime was extended to take advantage of favorable weather conditions to address key projects to improve mill availability. Additional third-party maintenance resources were added during the quarter to accelerate mill stabilization efforts\n\nThe Company also deployed a coordinated human resources strategy to further enhance the operation\u2019s leadership team, improve recruitment and retention efforts, and bolster training of mill operators. These efforts, combined with the accelerated mill maintenance plan, have resulted in significant improvements in mill availability late in the third quarter and month-to-date\n\nThe permit amendment application to operate at a year-round mining and milling rate of 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tonnes) per day is in the final stages of the approval process and expected to be received in the fourth quarter\n\nFull-year 2019 production guidance is unchanged at 1.5 \u2013 2.5 million ounces of silver, 25 \u2013 40 million pounds of zinc and 20 \u2013 35 million pounds of lead\n\n2019 Production Guidance\n\nCoeur\u2019s 2019 production guidance remains unchanged from its guidance published on August 7, 2019.\n\nGold Silver Zinc Lead (oz) (K oz) (K lbs) (K lbs) Palmarejo 95,000 \u2013 105,000 6,500 \u2013 7,200 \u2014 \u2014 Rochester 40,000 \u2013 50,000 4,200 \u2013 5,000 \u2014 \u2014 Kensington 117,000 \u2013 130,000 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Wharf 82,000 \u2013 87,000 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Silvertip \u2014 1,500 \u2013 2,500 25,000 \u2013 40,000 20,000 \u2013 35,000 Total 334,000 \u2013 372,000 12,200 \u2013 14,700 25,000 \u2013 40,000 20,000 \u2013 35,000\n\nFinancial Results and Conference Call\n\nCoeur will report its second quarter financial results on November 4, 2019 after the New York Stock Exchange closes for trading.
