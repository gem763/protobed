Here's what Congress is set to do when they come back to D.C.", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Members of Congress have had a long six weeks away from the nation's capital but they're coming back on Monday and there's a lot on their collective plate.\n\nQuite a lot has happened over the month of August, which has changed the legislative priorities in Washington. When senators and representatives were in recess, numerous mass shootings heightened the stakes for tackling gun violence. And still, the clock ticks on lingering priorities, such as a vote on a new North American trade deal and keeping the government from another shutdown.\n\nHere are some of the issues you can expect to hear about as Congress comes back to D.C.\n\nGuns\n\nThere have been four high-profile mass shootings since the House left for recess and three since the Senate left.\n\nThe most recent, a shooting spree in the area of Midland-Odessa area of Texas, left at least seven dead on Aug. 31. That shooting followed back-to-back-to-back massacres in Gilroy, Calif., El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. The four shootings left a total of 43 people dead and many more injured.\n\nThe Democratic-led House is expected to focus on the issue, holding news conferences, a forum and floor speeches in an attempt to pressure the Senate to take up gun-control measures that have already passed the House. House leaders have been most vocal about a bill on background checks that passed the Democratic-controlled House earlier this year.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has a hearing scheduled later this month on assault weapons. The panel is also expected to hold a meeting this week on a trio of measures. One would prevent those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes from being eligible to purchase firearms, another entices states to create \"red flag\" programs and a third bans high-capacity magazines. The bills could come up for a vote in the coming weeks.\n\nBut, the Senate isn't expected to take up any of these measures and has instead been discussing alternatives, including legislation addressing mental health, video games and a proposal that would provide grants to states that create \"red-flag\" programs. Politico reported Thursday that a variety of proposals were being considered by the White House, including the death penalty for mass shooters, allowing more records for background checks and tougher penalties for so-called straw purchasers, those who buy weapons for people who aren't legally allowed to have a gun.\n\nAt the forefront of the discussions are Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and President Donald Trump, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urges them both to pass the House-passed measures.\n\nMcConnell has maintained a noncommittal stance on the future of any gun-control legislation, explaining that he is looking to President Donald Trump, who appeared to support expanding checks but has since gone back and forth on the issue, on what sort of legislation the administration could support.\n\nTrade\n\nIt has been 10 months since the top leaders of U.S., Mexico and Canada signed off on a new North American trade deal, and Republicans \u2014 along with even some Democrats \u2014 are growing restless to ratify the deal.\n\nSupporters on Capitol Hill are hopeful the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement, known as USMCA, could come up for a vote in the fall but House Democrats are still working with the administration on a number of concerns, including enforcement mechanisms and labor standards.\n\nThe clock is ticking and the chances of the deal passing Congress in 2020, a sensitive election year, will drop significantly. There's also the possibility of Trump withdrawing from NAFTA without a new deal in place \u2014 something he has threatened as a way to get Congress to move on the agreement.\n\nThe deal, which would replace the Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has been a priority for Trump and would fulfill one of his campaign promises. But it's still up in the air whether Congress will ratify it.\n\nThe governments of Mexico, Canada and the U.S. must ratify the agreement in order for it to take effect. So far Mexico has done so and Canada has started the process but has yet to ratify the deal.", "description": "Quite a lot has happened since Congress went on recess, most notably four mass shootings that have heightened the stakes for tackling gun violence.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LmjWJfcmRSAN2Kfq0o29rQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/d0a95279f267fd5eae17aefd9b9af1c5", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
