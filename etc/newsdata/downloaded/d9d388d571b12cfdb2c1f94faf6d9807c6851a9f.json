Reluctantly, bewildered and shaken, the ailing president stood down. His last weeks in power had been dominated by a power struggle between his wife, Grace, and the former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, a long-serving veteran of Zimbabwe\u2019s 1970s liberation wars who had always been viewed as a likely successor. The news of Mugabe\u2019s departure was greeted with rejoicing across the nation.\n\nFor the other two questions there are clues, but no easy answers, to the making of this dictator.\n\nHe was abandoned by his father as a boy; he suffered the deaths of a three-year-old son and a compassionate wife; then there was his warped fascination with Britain.\n\nMugabe was awarded an honorary knighthood by the Queen then stripped of the honour, an insult he never forgave. The former colonial power shaped his dress code, manners and vision to the end. \u201cCricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe,\u201d he once said. \u201cI want ours to be a nation of gentlemen.\u201d\n\nTimeline Robert Mugabe Show Hide Mugabe is born in what was then British-ruled Southern Rhodesia. He is educated at Catholic schools and attends South Africa's University of Fort Hare. During the 1940s and 50s he teaches in Zambia and Ghana, where he is influenced by African independence movement leaders. After campaigning for Zimbabwe's independence, he is imprisoned for political agitation. While incarcerated, he earns two law degrees from the University of London. Released from prison, he escapes to Mozambique where Zimbabwe African National Union guerrilla fighters elect him to lead their struggle against white minority rule. Mugabe's Zanu-PF party wins independent Zimbabwe's first election and he takes office as prime minister. Mugabe deploys North Korean-trained troops to crush an insurgency by former guerrillas loyal to his liberation war rival Joshua Nkomo. Government forces are accused of involvement in the killing of 20,000 civilians, which Mugabe denies. Mugabe becomes president with sweeping executive powers after changes to the constitution and signs a unity pact with Nkomo, who becomes one of his two deputies. In 1990, Zanu-PF and Mugabe win further parliamentary and presidential elections. An economic crisis marked by high interest rates and inflation sparks riots. Zimbabweans reject a new constitution in a referendum, Mugabe's first defeat at the ballot box. Thousands of independence war veterans and their allies, backed by the government, seize white-owned farms, saying the land was illegally appropriated by white settlers. The US puts a financial freeze on Mugabe's government in response to land seizures, beginning a wave of sanctions against his regime. Mugabe wins a disputed presidential vote, which observers condemn as flawed. Zimbabwe is suspended from the British Commonwealth over accusations of human rights abuses and economic mismanagement. Hyperinflation reaches 500bn per cent, forcing millions of people to leave the country. Mugabe loses a presidential vote but wins the run-off after opponent Morgan Tsvangirai withdraws, citing violence against his supporters. A power-sharing agreement is signed. Despite reports saying Mugabe has been seriously ill with cancer, he wins another disputed presidential vote. Western observers cite multiple accounts of electoral fraud. After protesters stage the biggest show of defiance against Mugabe in a decade, he is forced to resign following an army coup and is replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mugabe dies aged 95.\n\nZimbabwe is a nation whose gentleness and articulacy seem at odds with the catalogue of torture and thuggery; a fertile land with the best climate in the world brought to the edge of ruin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Mugabe in 1976: leader of the Zimbabwean African National Union, one of the two armed liberation movements.

He rose with quiet determination and ruthlessness.\n\nRaised a Catholic and educated at missionary schools, he moved to Fort Hare University in South Africa for the first of his seven degrees and became a teacher in Ghana.\n\nWhen he returned to the then Rhodesia in 1960, his political activism earned him a 10-year prison term for \u201csubversive speech\u201d, after which he fled to neighbouring Mozambique to lead the guerrilla forces of the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu) \u2013 which had split from Joshua Nkomo\u2019s Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (Zapu) \u2013 in a protracted war against Ian Smith\u2019s government that left 27,000 dead.\n\nThe 1979 Lancaster House agreement in London brought independence to Zimbabwe and Mugabe returned home a hero.\n\nHe announced a policy of reconciliation and invited whites to help rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cIf yesterday I fought you as an enemy, today you have become a friend,\u201d he told them. \u201cIf yesterday you hated me, today you cannot avoid the love that binds me to you.\u201d\n\nHe initially ran a coalition government with Nkomo, his fellow freedom fighter, but the pair fell out.\n\nThen came the biggest counter-argument to the notion that Mugabe was a good man slowly corrupted by power: Gukurahundi, or \u201cthe rain that washes away the chaff before the spring rains\u201d.\n\nAs early as 1982 his North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade crushed an armed rebellion by fighters loyal to Nkomo in the province of Matabeleland. His rival\u2019s party, Zapu, was ethnically largely Ndebele, while Zanu was predominantly Shona. This divide underlay the vicious ethnic cleansing that ensued in the mid-80s, when at least 20,000 people died in Matabeleland, a series of massacres classified as genocide by the US-based Genocide Watch.\n\nFew in the west noticed, or wanted to. They preferred to see an economy that was growing as agriculture boomed and Mugabe built clinics and schools, turning Zimbabwe into one of the healthiest, best-educated and most hopeful countries in Africa.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Mugabe saluting supporters in Salisbury (now Harare) after returning to the country from exile to fight the general election.

Trade unions and political activists began organising what would become the first viable political threat to Mugabe, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). But it was partly bankrolled by white farmers, which allowed Mugabe to whip up militancy against it.\n\nIn 2000 Mugabe began a land reform programme, billed as an attempt to correct the unresolved colonialist legacy by giving white-owned farms to landless black people. Many saw it as a crude attempt to sideline the MDC, which commanded wide support among farm workers.\n\nWhite farmers were forcibly evicted by self-styled war veterans, many too young ever to have fought in the liberation war, and their properties handed to Zanu-PF cronies or black Zimbabweans who lacked the skills and capital to farm.\n\nThe ensuing chaos undermined the economy, which shrank to half the size it had been in 1980. The one-time \u201cbreadbasket of Africa\u201d became dependent on foreign aid to feed its masses. Hyperinflation turned the national currency into a standing joke \u2013 a hamburger cost 15m Zimbabwe dollars \u2013 and it had to be abolished as the US dollar became the de facto currency.\n\nSchools and hospitals fell apart, once-eradicated diseases returned and life expectancy crashed from 61 to 45. Millions of people moved to neighbouring South Africa and other countries, a monumental flight of intellectual capital.\n\nThe political environment also became hostile, with activists and journalists persecuted, jailed or murdered. The MDC claims that 253 people died in political violence in the 2008 election. The party\u2019s leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, widely seen as the vote\u2019s real winner, was forced to join Mugabe in an uneasy power-sharing agreement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, and president, Robert Mugabe, at a rally to mark Zimbabwe\u2019s 31st anniversary of independence in 2011. It was an uneasy relationship. Photograph: Reuters\n\n\u201cHe started very well but ended up disgraced because he eroded his own legacy by collapsing a once-vibrant economy, by violence, by appearing to tendencies of dictatorship and one-man rule,\u201d Tsvangirai told the Guardian in a 2011 interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what his record will reveal.\u201d\n\nMugabe could not bear to relinquish power even when the democratic current turned against him two decades ago, he added. \u201cI think the turning point of Mugabe was when he lost the support of the people, when it dawned on him the people no longer supported him. Then he became reactionary. He reacted to the people\u2019s will by enforcing his will on the people. That was around the late 90s.\u201d\n\nQuite when, and why, Mugabe \u201cmoved from a hero to a villain\u201d will be debated for many years to come. Denis Norman, a white farmer who became his agriculture minister from 1980 to 1985, said: \u201cHe was such a complex character who was very difficult to fully understand and analyse. He was a very intelligent man who ruthlessly pursued his goals and ambitions, which during his rise to power must have injured many who were also competing for top positions.\n\n\u201cI have always maintained that his driving force was the desire to control and remain in power, and once achieved to remain in that position. I am well aware of the allegations of corruption that have surrounded him, but without any evidence as opposed to rumours, I don\u2019t believe that the creation of wealth was ever his motive; the same cannot be said for many of those who surround him.\n\n\u201cThe softer side of his nature was rarely if ever seen, but it certainly used to exist, along with a warm sense of humour, but I believe he guarded both very carefully in case they are interpreted as a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nNorman added: \u201cI don\u2019t think history will judge him favourably. He will be remembered for all the events that have taken place during his latter period in power: the land invasions, the rigged elections, the beatings in the townships and the ineptitude of the courts.\u201d\n\nAnother insight is offered by Simba Makoni, who toured Europe with Mugabe in the late 1970s and served in his government. \u201cI know of two Mugabes: the early Mugabe and the later Mugabe.\n\n\u201cThe first Mugabe of the liberation struggle and the first 10, 15 years of independence isn\u2019t the Mugabe we have today. I didn\u2019t know him to be cruel, I didn\u2019t know him to be uncaring in the time that I worked closely with him in the early years.\u201d\n\nHe said the status Mugabe \u201cdeserves of a national hero on the basis of his role in the liberation of the country\u201d was \u201ctotally wiped out\u201d by his conduct after.\n\nMakoni, a former finance minister, identifies three factors which led to the change in the leader\u2019s character: the accord with Nkomo that in effect destroyed any meaningful opposition \u2013 \u201cit removed the only alternative to Mugabe so he had no reason to look over his shoulder\u201d; his switch from prime minister to president in 1987; and the death of his Ghanaian-born first wife Sally in 1992.\n\nAll of these happened after the Gukurahundi massacres. Makoni conceded: \u201cI accept yes, you won\u2019t find a rational explanation why a caring, compassionate leader would allow 20,000-30,000 of his citizens to be annihilated under the auspices of Gukurahundi. That notwithstanding, I would say the greater part of Mugabe would come through as a caring, compassionate, committed leader who wanted the best for his people \u2013 with the deviation or the aberration of Gukurahundi.\u201d\n\nMany of those who knew him describe an inner conflict between Mugabe the African nationalist and Mugabe the child of British colonialism.\n\nHeidi Holland, who interviewed him for her book Dinner with Mugabe, described him as having tears in his eyes when discussing the royal family. Tendai Biti, another former finance minister, called him \u201ca British gentleman in a proper Victorian sense\u201d.\n\nMakoni, who quit Zanu-PF to lead his own party, Mavambo Kusile Dawn, after a failed attempt to defeat Mugabe, said: \u201cI would say Britain is a passion, not an obsession. He loves the place and its character, its mannerisms.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emmerson Mnangagwa, known as \u2018the crocodile\u2019, in 2002. Photograph: Obed Zilwa/AP\n\n\u201cI remember once his crew did the longest single flight because Mugabe left New York to go to Wellington in New Zealand and he came via London. You would fly from New York to the west coast across the Pacific to New Zealand, but he had to come back to London first. Every opportunity he had, when he still could go through London, he would go through London.\u201d\n\nMugabe was stripped of his honorary knighthood in 2008 and subjected to targeted sanctions that prevented him travelling to Britain and other countries. He could no longer shop on Savile Row for his beloved suits and descended into what Tsvangirai describes as an \u201canti-British paranoia\u201d. As the years wore on, he became increasingly bellicose in denouncing Britain while repeating the mantra: \u201cZimbabwe will never be a colony again.\u201d\n\nMakoni said: \u201cAll this vituperation, my reading of it, is like grapes are sour. My sense is all the anger about the illegal sanctions and all that \u2026 the fact that he hasn\u2019t been able to go to London, I think it irked him a lot.\u201d\n\nThere is one man who will forever cast a shadow across Mugabe.\n\nNelson Mandela\u2019s life and career paralleled Mugabe\u2019s in many ways until the South African president relinquished power after one five-year term. Mandela is revered as the greatest statesman Africa has produced; Mugabe, who clung on to power beyond his time, is seen as its fallen angel.\n\nAllister Sparks, the late South African journalist, recalled a conversation with Mandela: \u201cWe got to talking about Mugabe, whom he really profoundly disliked, and I think it was reciprocated. He said, \u2018You know Allister, the trouble with Mugabe is that he was the star \u2013 and then the sun came up.\u2019\u201d", "description": "A complex character who ruthlessly pursued his goals, Mugabe leaves a mixed legacy: an independence leader who built his country up, then helped destroy it", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30196ccdcb01eb9a031d8bffac224f9fa7f301d/0_182_2736_1641/master/2736.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=beda63bc5c5380542e385622c21fab59", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
