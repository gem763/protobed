The utility said the protective blackouts could last two days.\n\nSteve Volmer, the chief fire behavior analyst at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said the Kincade fire was threatening to jump to the west of U.S. 101, where there have been no fires since the 1940s.\n\n\u201cThe fuels in that area are extremely dense, they\u2019re extremely old and decadent and they\u2019re extremely dry,\u201d he said.\n\nBy early on Sunday, more than 3,000 firefighters and other crew members were battling the Kincade Fire, which had scorched 30,000 acres (12,141 hectares), burned down 79 structures and threatened 31,175 more, Cal Fire said. Only 10% of the fire area was contained, it said.\n\nA forecast for slowdown in wind speeds to 20 to 40 miles per hour (32 to 64 km per hour) during the day on Sunday could aid firefighters before higher gusts are expected to return overnight.\n\nNo fatalities were attributed to either the Kincade or Tick fire, and the causes of both have yet to be determined.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the fire department said it had contained 65% of the Tick Fire near the city of Santa Clarita, about 35 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, which has charred 4,615 acres, including 22 structures, since Thursday.\n\nMost of the more than 40,000 residents who had been ordered to evacuate were allowed to return to their homes by Saturday afternoon, the county fire department said.\n\n(Writing and additional reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "The southward march of a Northern California wildfire toward the more populated areas above the San Francisco Bay led officials on Sunday to raise the number of residents ordered to leave their homes in the area to 180,000.
