Not in Zumba Strong\u2019 | Zoe Williams", "language": "en", "text": "Zumba Strong is a new discipline, which is how I fetched up in a class for instructors. Ha. An hour before it, I would have been using the word \u201cdiscipline\u201d facetiously, to indicate my ironic distance from the wildfire fitness industry that likes to style itself as somewhere between a martial art and a PhD. An hour afterwards, still panting, I understood that instructors really do have discipline up the wazoo. They are a fascinating bunch, but that\u2019s an anthropological deep dive we\u2019ll have to go on some other time.\n\nIf you\u2019re expecting dance moves, you\u2019re in the wrong scene. The class is divided into four sections, all of them aerobically very intense, but not like traditional aerobics, except for a grapevine here and there. There are a lot of boxing moves \u2013 jabs, upper cuts, footwork, feints backwards and forwards, and more lunges than I think I\u2019ve ever done in a single hour.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t just be listening to pop songs,\u201d the head instructor promised at the start, and I felt downhearted, as I used to love going to pump in the 90s and dropping weights on myself while listening to banging house tunes. It was the only time I knew what was in the charts. This programme has bespoke tracks for each section, and the difference is incredible. Just when you\u2019re at the point of slackening off, the music takes on an extra dimension to push you through.\n\nFit in my 40s: can I become a strongwoman? Read more\n\nI\u2019m always incredibly easy on myself during squats and lunges, clinging on to some ancient knee injury to exculpate myself when I give up halfway through. I did not give up once during this class; if anything, I got progressively more energetic as each section went on, which I swear had nothing to do with any decision I may have made, and everything to do with the music. It was discovered in 1911 that cyclists went faster when they listened to music than they did in silence; almost exactly a century later, it was demonstrated that cyclists used 7% less oxygen when the movement occurred synchronously with the music, than when the tempo lagged behind. The effect is greater than simple feel-good motivation: it improves our efficiency, probably (this is my guess) by unifying mind and body. The instructor talked about the uniqueness of the tracks, composed by a Grammy award winner. I didn\u2019t find any of it memorable \u2013 I couldn\u2019t hum it now \u2013 but it worked.\n\nBy the time we got to the mat work (planks, crunches, push-ups, side-planks, your basic nightmare) I was pretty well spent. If I\u2019m honest, I prefer Zumba Classic, which is easier and more playful. But I was bowled over by how well Zumba Strong tricks you into working harder than all your instincts dictate.\n\nWhat I learned\n\n\n\nGetting to the ground (for a burpee, a bear crawl, a suicide push-up) is a savage request in a high-aerobic class; brilliant for your fitness.", "description": "I couldn\u2019t hum any of the music back to you \u2013 but it somehow pushed me through", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c07aee88f7f367a277d4bf9809b1f1baab80181/0_9_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69146b02a0b1db9c1c99e4b0c6727a09", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
