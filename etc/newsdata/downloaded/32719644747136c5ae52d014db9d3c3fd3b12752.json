The 80 or so mostly white males who ate the venison agreed to participate in the study carried out by the Oneida County Health Department and experts at the State University of New York-Binghamton.\n\nWhile researchers found no significant health changes, they did report that the group overall ate less venison. Health conditions like vision loss, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, weight changes, high blood pressure and arthritis were attributed to old age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only study I\u2019m aware of that has this progressive follow-up of a known point source contamination where we know the people ate a contaminated animal,\u201d researcher Ralph Garruto, professor of biomedical and biological sciences at Binghamton, told USA Today.\n\nResearchers check back in with the group every two years and plan to do so again in the spring, Garruto said.\n\nHe said as time goes on, the chances of a human developing CWD get slimmer, but there\u2019s always a lingering chance.\n\n\u201cIt only takes one case,\u201d he said.\n\nThe results from the 2014 study are a sigh of relief, as CWD continues to ravage wildlife in at least 24 states \u2014 with the majority of cases in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas.\n\nThough there are no known human cases of CWD, a Minnesota health expert recently warned that the disease might one day be found in people. He pointed to mad cow disease, which turned up in humans as Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in 1996, as an example.\n\nBut other experts say there\u2019s no risk of crossover.\n\n\u201cRight now, most scientists believe there is a pretty strong \u2018species barrier,\u2019 which means that it\u2019s unlikely the disease will jump to a new species,\u201d said Krysten Schuler, a wildlife disease ecologist and co-director at the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab.\n\nCWD affects deer, elk, reindeer, sika deer and moose and causes the animals to lose weight and walk in repetitive patterns. They also lose their fear of humans and stumble before ultimately dying.\n\nLawmakers are scrambling to pass legislation that would call for a federal study of the brain-eating disease.", "description": "Researchers examined about 80 people who\u2019ve feasted on the meat of deer that tested positive for chronic wasting disease -- a fatal illness that causes zombie-like behavior in the animals.", "authors": ["February"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/deer-zombie-meat-758.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-02-22"}
