Chief: Islamic State Remains Resilient in Afghanistan", "language": "en", "text": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the Islamic State extremist group remains resilient in Afghanistan despite \u201ca high pace\u201d of operations against it by government and international forces \u2014 and is urging all armed groups not to interfere in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nThe U.N. chief said in a report to the Security Council circulated Monday that between mid-June and early September 183 incidents were attributed to Islamic State fighters \u2014 nearly double the 93 incidents during the same period in 2018.\n\nGuterres\u2019 report was written before U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly ended a nearly yearlong effort to reach a political settlement with the Taliban on Saturday. Trump said Monday that U.S. peace talks with the Taliban were now \u201cdead.\u201d\n\nIn the report, the secretary-general says the U.S.-Taliban talks, a dialogue between Afghan parties in Qatar and strengthened efforts \u201cto build a regional consensus on peace have given rise to cautious optimism that a formal peace process may soon begin.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The Security Council is scheduled to discuss Guterres\u2019 report Tuesday.\n\nGuterres appealed to all Afghan leaders and candidates \u201cto display leadership in discouraging fraud and to take firm action to prevent it.\u201d He said the election \u201cmust be contested on a level playing field, without unduly favoring any candidate.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the public commitments of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah \u2014 both candidates for the top job \u2014 to contest the election fairly.\n\nHe also noted the steps taken by the government to separate functions of the state from the presidential race. But, he added, \u201cAt the same time, allegations of misuse of state resources and perceptions of interference in the work of the electoral management bodies are concerning.\u201d\n\nGuterres urged candidates not to make \u201cspurious or sweeping allegations of fraud without sufficient evidence,\u201d but to report serious allegation to appropriate authorities.\n\n\u201cThose who attempt or commit fraud must be held to account,\u201d he said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Antonio Guterres says the Islamic State extremist group remains resilient in Afghanistan despite \"a high pace\" of operations against it.", "authors": ["Edith M.
