Intended to transform and modernize the military\u2019s cloud computing systems, the contract is considered more important than its size because of its centrality to new forms of war. Much of the military operates on 1980s and 1990s computer systems, and the Pentagon has spent billions of dollars trying to make them talk to one another.\n\nThe decision was a surprise because Amazon had been considered a front-runner to win the contract. But that was before Mr. Trump began his criticisms of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and, for the past several years, the owner of The Washington Post \u2014 a news organization the president refers to as the \u201cAmazon Washington Post.\u201d\n\nA speechwriter for former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who over time became an enthusiast of moving Pentagon operations to the cloud, alleged in a book scheduled for publication next week that Mr. Trump had wanted to \u201cscrew\u201d Amazon and give the contract to another company. In public, Mr. Trump said there were other \u201cgreat companies\u201d he wanted to make sure had a chance at the contract.", "description": "Amazon was considered a front-runner for the cloud computing project before President Trump began criticizing the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos.", "authors": ["Kate Conger", "David E.
