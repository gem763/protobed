The identity of the man has not yet been revealed, but police said he has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and suspicion of manslaughter. 20-year-old man from Northern Ireland: The man was arrested after getting off a ferry on Saturday afternoon.A blue Scania truck that he was driving has been impounded by the police.\n\nRobinson, from Co Armagh, Northern Ireland, whose partner is expecting twins, did not enter any pleas and spoke only to confirm his name, address and his date of birth.\n\nAt the end of the five-minute hearing he was remanded in custody until November 25, where he will appear at the Old Bailey in London.\n\nDistrict Judge Timothy King remanded Robinson into custody, saying: 'You have heard the nature of the allegations you face and the majority of these can only be dealt with in the crown court.\n\n'I therefore allocate all matters to the Central Criminal Court'.\n\nRobinson's solicitor Julian Hayes made no application for bail.\n\nThe trucker is understood to have called 999 after opening his rear doors on an industrial estate in Thurrock, Essex, to find piles of dead bodies in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nFour others have been arrested by police - including the Irish couple who were the last known owners of the lorry, Joanna and Thomas Maher, from Warrington, Cheshire, who have been bailed.\n\nA 48-year-old man, who had not been named, was arrested at Stansted Airport on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and suspicion of manslaughter on Friday night.\n\n24 hours later a 20-year-old man from Northern Ireland was held after getting off a ferry in Dublin on Saturday afternoon, where police impounded his blue Scania lorry.\n\nThe names of eight suspected victims feared dead by their families, are: Pham Tra My, 26, Hung Nguyen, 33, Anna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26, Le Van Ha, 30, Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, Joseph Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, and Hoang Van Tiep, 18.\n\nTheir horrific stories have started to emerge as their families revealed they had not heard from their loved-ones since the tragedy on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.\n\nThe victims appear to mainly be from Vietnam, travelling on fake Chinese passports provided by traffickers based in the Fujian region east of Hong Kong, dominated by the so-called 'Snakeshead' gangs.\n\nIn Belgium, police are hunting the driver who delivered the trailer to Zeebrugge, the port it left before arriving in the UK.\n\nAll of the victims have now been moved from the truck in Tilbury Docks to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, for post-mortem examinations to be carried out.\n\nEssex Police initially believed they were all Chinese nationals, but Vietnamese men and women are now feared to be among the dead.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore said the nationality of the victims is not yet known, but the focus is now on the Vietnamese community - although 'there may be other nationalities involved'.\n\nJoanna and Thomas Maher, arrested in connection with Essex lorry deaths because of historic links to the lorry. They have now been released on bail\n\nOn Saturday police seized three expensive cars and a motorbike belonging to an Irish haulage company boss and his wife from their drive in Warrington\n\nRobinson arrived in the UK at the weekend after a ferry from Dublin to Holyhead. He picked up the trailer, which had been shipped from Zeebrugge to Purfleet. Minutes later, he pulled into the Essex industrial estate and the alarm was raised\n\nWhat is Northern Irish lorry driver Mo Robinson charged with? 39 counts of manslaughter of 'persons unknown' on or around October 24 One count of conspiracy to commit human trafficking between December 1 2018 and October 24 2019 One count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between December 1 2018 and October 24 2019 One count of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property One count of acquiring criminal property\n\nHe said there were 'very, very few' identity documents recovered and that police will share fingerprints with Vietnamese authorities in a bid to identify the bodies.\n\nThe BBC said it has been in contact with six Vietnamese families who fear their relatives are among the dead, with some having the smuggling fees repaid.\n\nIt is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, where temperatures can be as low as minus 25C if the fridge is activated, or the exact route it travelled.\n\nBelgian officials said the trailer arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm on Tuesday and left the port the same day en route to Purfleet.\n\nThe trailer arrived at Purfleet at around 12.30am on Wednesday, and was picked up by the cab, known as the tractor, which arrived from Northern Ireland via Holyhead in North Wales on Sunday.\n\nThe lorry left the port at Purfleet shortly after 1.05am before police were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park on Eastern Avenue in Grays at 1.40am.\n\nFaces of the migrants who died in truck tragedy while trying to enter UK\n\nThe bodies of eight women and 31 men could have been frozen in the truck for several days when they were discovered on Wednesday in Grays, Essex, after the container criss-crossed the Channel via refugee hotspots.\n\nIt is now thought that as many as 25 of the 39 victims are Vietnamese and from the same impoverished coastal region of Yen Than. Relatives said most were going to work in nail salons.\n\nVietHome, a British organisation which tries to help UK-based Vietnamese residents, said it had been sent 20 photographs and names of people feared to have been inside the lorry container.\n\nEight suspected victims have so far come to light: Hung Nguyen, Anna Bui Thi Nhung, Nguyen Dinh Tu, Le Van Ha, Vo Ngoc Nam, Pham Thi Tra My, Joseph Nguyen Dinh Luong and Hoang Van Tiep.\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Vietnam paid an agent over $10,000 with the hope of entering the U.K.\n\nThe nail technician who paid \u00a38,800 to make it to Britain\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Vietnam paid an agent over \u00a38,000 [$10,000] with the hope of entering the U.K. to work as a nail technician, according to a relative.\n\nHer mother and a sister today cried as they set up an altar with incense and a photo of the suspected victim where family and friends can pray at their home in Do Thanh village.\n\nThe family heard from a friend living in the UK that 'Nhung is one of the victims,' said one of her relatives, who was visiting the missing teen's mother.\n\nNhung and many others from Yen Thanh district, where the village is located, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Hanoi, travel abroad looking to make the type of money they cannot earn back home. One of their main goals is to send back enough to allow their families to build large homes that they would otherwise be unable to afford.\n\nOn October 21, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged, Nhung wrote in a Facebook post: 'Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face.'\n\nA relative looks at an image of Nhung. The 19-year-old wanted to work as a nail technician, according to a relative\n\nNhung's family said she first left Nhung on her journey overseas in August. She went to China first, before eventually making her way to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she boarded the fated truck.\n\n'I just want a peaceful life,' Nhung wrote in a caption beneath a photo of her smiling in a green field a few weeks after leaving Vietnam.\n\nLate on Saturday night, Nhung's family, devoid of hope, set up an altar in her memory, with her photo next to her father's.\n\nHer father died of cancer a few years ago. Her mother was unable to work because of health complications and so her loved ones clubbed together to finance a new life overseas, Nhung's family said.\n\n'Nhung didn't have the qualifications to get a good job with handsome pay. Nor do her friends and many others here,' said Nhung's uncle, Hoang Binh.\n\n'Going abroad and sending back money was the only choice,' he added.\n\nBy early September, it was not clear where she was, but Nhung was already well into her trip, and reflecting on her next steps.\n\nBeside a stock image of two children flying kites at sunset, she posted: 'As I grow up, I see that life is not as peaceful as I used to think. When I grow up, I want to go back to my childhood, when I lived freely'.\n\nTon Quang Tuan, one of Nhung's friends living in Berlin, said that 'We went out a few times when Nhung was in Berlin' and added that 'she was in a good mood, very happy,' but they lost contact after she said she had to leave for Britain.\n\nIt was not clear how Nhung had travelled from the Vietnamese countryside to China and then Berlin, but the German capital has emerged in recent years as a staging ground for Vietnamese and other migrants looking to start new lives in Britain.\n\n'I feel lonely in the place I used to dream of everyday,' Nhung wrote on September 25.\n\nIt was unclear where she was - Vietnamese smugglers are said to advise their subjects to live discreetly and not to give away too many clues in order to evade detection from the authorities.\n\nA few days later, Nhung was pictured outside Berlin Cathedral with a cup of bubble tea in her hands.\n\nBy late October, Nhung was in Belgium. She posted photos of herself, again with a cup of bubble tea in her hand, excitedly exploring the sights of Brussels, including the old stock exchange and the bustling Rue Auguste Orts thoroughfare.\n\nIt was from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge that the doomed container eventually departed. Her family believe that she was on board.\n\nIn Berlin, Nhung wrote: 'Back in Vietnam, I thought Europe was pink. But it turns out it's black'.\n\n\n\nThe 'VIP' traveller who paid \u00a330,000 believing she would travel to Britain by plane and car and sent harrowing messages to her mother as she died in the back of a freezing lorry crossing the North Sea\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, from Vietnam sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed.\n\nThey claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'.\n\nShe is from Ha Tinh, an impoverished province in a part of Vietnam where many of the country's illegal migrants come from.\n\nNguyen Thi Phong and Pham Van Thin, told CNN it was 'very painful' to receive the text - saying she must have known she was going to die when she sent it.\n\n'I've lost both my loved one and my money,' her father Pham said, claiming he and his partner scraped together the money to pay for their daughter to travel to the UK.\n\nThe pair, who make around $400 a month between them, said the smugglers did not tell them how their daughter would be transported to the UK.\n\n'The smugglers said that this was a ... safe route, that people would go by airplane, car ... if I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,' Pham added.\n\nA human rights worker in Vietnam, who has spoken with Tra My's family, revealed she made the perilous journey because her family was in debt and she was desperately trying to help them.\n\nHer family claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'\n\nIn text messages sent at 10.28pm GMT on Tuesday, two hours before they were all found dead, Pham Thi Tra told her mother, 'I love you so much...I'm sorry' (pictured)\n\n'She had just returned from Japan where she was working to try and pay off the debt. And that was not enough and so she looked for a better future,' she told the BBC.\n\nAsking to remain anonymous, the human rights worker continued: 'For this girl it is very sad that she took the risk because she was dealing with debt that was created by another man in the family.\n\n'And I also learnt that the service that she was using was called 'very important service' and so it is like a business class ticket on the lorry and with that she had to pay double or three times the price of the cheap ticket.'\n\nThe human rights worker added that migrants are told they can vast amounts of money by moving to the UK, and the 26-year-old may have been convinced to purchase a 'VIP ticket' to get there.\n\nHe family mortgaged the house to get that money for her, the human rights worked added.\n\nPham Thi Tra's last text messages were sent at 10.28pm BST on Tuesday - two hours before the truck reached the UK, as it was en route from Belgium.\n\nShe told her mother: 'I'm sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn't succeeded. Mum, I love you so much. I'm dying because I can't breathe.'\n\nTra My's brother told the BBC on Friday that his sister had told them not to contact her because 'the organisers' did not allow her to receive calls.\n\nHe said she flew to China from her home in Can L\u1ed9c, a rural district of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province in Vietnam, then left for France and initially attempted to cross the border into the UK on October 19, but 'got caught' and turned back.\n\nNguyen Dinh Luong, 20, pictured at Montmartre in Paris planned to work in a nail salon when he got to Britain\n\n20-year-old impoverished Vietnamese province with dreams of a better life in a British nail bar\n\nAnother of the suspected victims was revealed to be Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20.\n\nHis father Nguyen Dinh Gia said his son told him two weeks ago he planned to travel to Britain from France, where he had been living illegally since 2018.\n\nHe said he would pay \u00a310,000 [$14,000] for the journey and planned to work in a nail salon when he got to Britain.\n\nBut Gia got a call several days ago from a Vietnamese man saying 'Please have some sympathy, something unexpected happened,' he told AFP.\n\n'I fell to the ground when I heard that,' Gia told AFP.\n\n'It seemed that he was in the truck with the accident, all of them dead,' he added.\n\nHis father told The Associated Press he had not been able to reach him since last week. He had said he would join a group in Paris that was trying to reach England.\n\n'He often called home but I haven't been able to reach him since the last time we talked last week,' Nguyen Dinh Gia said. 'I told him that he could go to anywhere he wants as long as it's safe. He shouldn't worry about money, I'll take care of it.'\n\nHe said his son left home in central Ha Tinh province to work in Russia in 2017, then on to Ukraine. In April 2018, he arrived in Germany then traveled to France. He told his family that he wanted to go to the UK.\n\nLuong's older brother, Pham Dinh Hai, said that Luong had a tattoo of praying hands on a cross on his right shoulder. The family said they shared the information with local authorities. Luong is also from Ha Tinh.\n\nOne of the newly named suspected victims, Nguyen Dinh Tu\n\nThe ex-soldier who left his wife and young son at home\n\nOne of the newly named suspected victims, Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26, had a few months ago asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise \u00a311,000 ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.\n\nMs Hoang revealed he had been working illegally in Romania and Germany and had begged her for money to get to the UK.\n\n'I lost contact with him on October 21,' Thuong said with tears in her eyes. 'I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything'.\n\nTu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick him up.\n\n'They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but they called and said Tu was in that truck,' Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, said.\n\n'I haven't heard anything from my son'.\n\nTu had a few months ago asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong (pictured with her son) to help him raise \u00a311,000 ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom\n\nFather-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, is also feared to have been in the ill-fated container\n\nFather-of-two who called his family on day of tragedy asking them to pray for his safe journey to Britain\n\nFather-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, is also feared to have been in the ill-fated container.\n\nHis wife, Ta Thi Oanh, told Vietnamese media that he had called her last Tuesday afternoon to say he was on the truck going to Britain.\n\nHe asked her to call her parents and ask them to pray for him, but has not been heard of since.\n\nMr Nam's father, Vo Ngoc Luyen, said: 'After reading information about the 39 people in the container in the UK, my family is extremely shocked. We are anxiously waiting for official information from the authorities.'\n\nNam is believed to have travelled to Romania, before Germany and France, to find work.
