First-time buyers are exempt from stamp duty if their purchase costs less than \u00a3500,000.\n\n\n\nFor purchases of more than \u00a31.5 million, rates were hiked from 7% to 12% in 2014.\n\n\n\nOverall transaction levels across England since the changes have fallen by 0.8%, the report said.\n\n\n\nBut transaction declines were the worst in Kensington and Chelsea. The London borough is the most expensive enclave in the country, with the average house price currently standing at \u00a32 million, according to a recent house price index. Transactions in the neighborhood have dropped 21.2% since the new rates were introduced, the report said.\n\n\n\nThe City of Westminster, the next most expensive area in England, where homes cost an average of \u00a31.4 million, has seen the second largest declines in transaction levels, down 20.5%.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Basquiat\u2019s Works to Headline Major Auctions During Frieze London\n\nThe two affluent neighborhoods were followed by London\u2019s Tower Hamlets where transactions have dropped 20.2% since the stamp duty changes; in wealthy Elmbridge, Surrey, transactions fell 18.7%; and in Cambridge they dropped 18%.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s re-shuffle has dented buyer sentiment across the board, particularly at the top end of the market,\u201d said Marc von Grundherr, director of Benham and Reeves, in the report. \u201cOf course, those buying a home at the highest-price threshold may be better able to afford stamp duty, but a steep increase has left many thinking twice.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe government should seriously consider scrapping their archaic money grab to help stimulate an otherwise weary housing market, as tinkering with the nuts and bolts has done nothing to help,\u201d Mr. von Grundherr said.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has already been mulling reversing the increased rates of stamp duty on homes sold for over \u00a31.5 million, as well as abolishing the tax on homes sold for less than \u00a3500,000, Mansion Global previously reported.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-108908?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
