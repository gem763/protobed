LiDAR technology harnesses a laser to measure distances to the Earth\u2019s surface and can prove extremely valuable to study what is hidden in areas with thick vegetation.\n\nThe 2011 map, which covers 4,400 square miles of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Chiapas, was published by Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the Times reported.\n\n'FIRST OF ITS KIND' ANCIENT MAYA TOOL DISCOVERED IN LAGOON\n\nInomata told Fox News that the discovery followed his research at the site of Ceibal in Guatemala, where a ceremonial complex dating back to 1000 to 900 B.C. was found. \u201cWe then went to this area (Tabasco) thinking that there may be similar ceremonial complexes of this period,\u201d he explained, via email. \u201cIt was great to see that there [are] more sites of this type than we expected. It is also remarkable that they had very standardized rectangular formations.\u201d\n\nAlthough visible on LiDAR maps, many sites, such as one dubbed \u201cLa Carmelita\u201d are difficult to find in ground-based surveys, according to the Times.\n\nThe discovery of the 27 lost Maya ritual sites sheds new light on the ancient culture. \u201cThis is the period when people were just starting to use ceramics and adopting a sedentary way of life,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe presence of these formal ceremonial complex in this early period indicates that certain rituals and religious ideas spread over a wide area as people accepted new ways of life.\u201d\n\nINCREDIBLE MAYA DISCOVERY: ANCIENT KING'S MASK UNCOVERED IN MEXICO\n\nThe Mexican Institute of Anthropology and History also participated in the project.\n\nThere have been a number of fascinating Maya discoveries across central America in recent years.\n\nExperts recently discovered a unique ancient tool that was used by Maya salt workers more than 1,000 years ago. Fashioned from the mineral jadeite, the chisel-style implement was found at the site of Ek Way Nal, a Maya salt works in southern Belize that is now submerged in a saltwater lagoon.\n\nMYSTERIOUS LOST MAYA CITIES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALAN JUNGLE\n\nLast year an ancient mask depicting a 7th-century Maya king was discovered in southern Mexico.\n\nAlso in 2018, archaeologists harnessed sophisticated technology to reveal lost cities and thousands of ancient structures deep in the Guatemalan jungle, confirming that the Maya civilization was much larger than previously thought.\n\nLiveScience reports that hundreds of Maya artifacts that may have been used in ritual animal sacrifices have also been discovered at the bottom of a Guatemalan lake.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFrom its heart in what is now Guatemala, the Maya empire reached the peak of its power in the sixth century A.D., according to History.com, although most of the civilization\u2019s cities were abandoned around 900 A.D.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.", "description": "An eagle-eyed archaeologist has used a freely available online map to locate 27 Maya ceremonial sites in Mexico.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/LidarElSaraguato.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
