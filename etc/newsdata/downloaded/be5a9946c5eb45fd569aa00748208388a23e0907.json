Take it off\u2019. I responded, \u2018Are you serious? This is my hijab\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhat happened next left Iqbal feeling humiliated, upset, and wondering if she\u2019d been racially discriminated against due to her religion.\n\nAccording to a Facebook comment from the Paragon account, the bouncer was trying to ID Iqbal and mistook her hijab for a \u201chead scarf\u201d. But Iqbal says the bouncer did not ask to see her ID at any time, and if he had, he would have seen that she wears a hijab in her ID photograph, anyway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had an establishment ask me to remove my hijab [before],\u201d she told P.TV.\n\nIt is unlawful for a venue to refuse entry to a person on the basis of their religion, with NSW Department of Liquor and Gaming guidelines specifically advising that refusing entry to someone wearing a religious head covering could put the venue in breach of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977.\n\n\u201cI felt threatened and a bit scared,\u201d Iqbal said of the bouncer. \u201cIt was very aggressive and he\u2019s a big guy and I am actually a very small girl, so I was definitely threatened.\u201d\n\nIqbal says that when she was finally able to speak with Paragon management that night, they didn\u2019t offer an apology, instead standing by their bouncer.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of gaslighting. [It was] very humiliating and frustrating and also makes you feel a bit worthless to be told your anger isn\u2019t justified,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than a dozen police officers attended the incident, which P.TV understands was likely due to Extinction Rebellion protests having taken place earlier that day.\n\nIn a statement, NSW Police said they were satisfied there was no criminal activity during the incident, and provided advice to the group on how to lodge a formal complaint.\n\n\u201cPolice remained at the location to prevent any breach of the peace,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe group later dispersed without incident.\u201d\n\nIt was only after Iqbal posted about her experience to Facebook that she received an apology, but one in which she says the events are being misconstrued.\n\nA comment from the Paragon Facebook account, which is attributed to Ryan\u2019s Hotel Group operations manager Craig Wesker, \u201cunreservedly\u201d apologises for the bouncer\u2019s mistake.\n\n\u201cAs this was [the bouncer\u2019s] first shift on the venue, he no doubt wanted to impress the venue management with his professionalism and attention to detail in carrying out his duties and responsibilities diligently,\u201d a comment from the Paragon Facebook account reads, which is attributed to Ryan\u2019s Hotel Group operations manager Craig Wesker.\n\n\u201cDue to this diligence when checking you (sic) ID and trying to ensure he had facial recognition, he asked you to remove you (sic) hijab interpreting it as only a head scarf.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably you were taken aback by the request and then by virtue of the fact that there was quite a number of people trying to enter the venue, he asked you to step to one side so he could talk to you further about it. This action appears to have been interpreted you (incorrectly) as the Security Personal denying you entry for you refusing to remove your hijab.\u201d\n\nIqbal said she felt like the apology was trying to shift the blame back onto her.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty insulting they were standing by the bouncer\u2019s actions and referring to him as diligent and professional,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a post written for blog 5why about her experience, Iqbal said it was the first time she\u2019d had a negative interaction with a bouncer.\n\n\u201cMost bouncers see my hijab and are happy to let me in, because they know that I don\u2019t drink, so I won\u2019t be causing any problems. I usually end up chatting to the Muslim ones, and we have a nice moment of feeling like there\u2019s a community of us out there,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWomen wearing Islamic headwear are the most likely people to be the target of Islamophobic incidents, research from the Centre for Islamic Studies and Civilisation, Charles Sturt University and the Islamophobia Register of Australia found in 2017.\n\nNeither Wesker nor Paragon responded to requests for comment from P.TV by the time of publication.", "description": "Sydney woman Soaliha Igbal said she was left humiliatied and disappointed after being told to remove her hijab by a bouncer at the Paragon Hotel.", "authors": ["Alex Bruce-Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/hijab-lead.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
