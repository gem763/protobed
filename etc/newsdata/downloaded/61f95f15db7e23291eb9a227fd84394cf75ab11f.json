Times defends delay in reporting Trump\u2019s suggestion that migrants be shot", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cJulie Davis and Mike Shear took a leave from The Times to report \u2018Border Wars,\u2019\u201d the Times spokesperson wrote. \"Their reporting for the book, like all reporting, was subject to conditions agreed to with their sources. When they could, they shared newsworthy and imminent information with The Times for its continuing coverage of immigration. This news was best suited for the book excerpt.\u201d\n\nTrump, who sat for an interview with Davis and Shear over the summer, ripped the book on Wednesday with a familiar \u201cfake news\u201d jab. Davis noted that the authors brought detailed accounts of what they were reporting to the White House in advance of publication and that pushback Wednesday from the deputy press secretary was \u201cnot a denial\u201d of the facts.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for reporters to provide behind-the-scenes anecdotes in books published months after the end of political campaigns or major news events. But the Times story drew more criticism because of the nature of the revelations and potential for harm if the president\u2019s suggestion to shoot migrants had been carried out.\n\nNewsrooms have long grappled with how reporters juggle beat reporting and book projects, though the issue is especially pronounced these days at the Times. Vanity Fair reported in May that around two dozen journalists, including many covering especially newsy beats, had landed book deals.\n\nThere\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule for how Times editors handle books. The Sunday Business section ran an excerpt of Mike Isaac\u2019s book on Uber, \u201cSuper Pumped,\u201d while Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey\u2019s follow-up on their reporting on the Harvey Weinstein scandal, \u201cShe Said,\u201d was covered as a news story.\n\nThe Times came under fire last month for its handling of revelations from Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly\u2019s book on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, including a new allegation of sexual misconduct. The paper faced criticism for running Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s piece in Sunday Review, an opinion section, and for omitting a key factual detail, which led to an editor\u2019s note.\n\nPresident Donald Trump seized on the editor\u2019s note to attack the book as \u201cfake news\u201d and called for the resignation of everyone at the Times involved in the \u201csmear\u201d story.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b9/31/9ab78dbf42048ff902334e7ecfa2/190916-nyt-getty-773.jpg"}
