Instead, he'd beg his mom to take him to the video store to browse the horror section.\n\n\"That was my playground,\" he said.\n\nHorror movies were a comfort. He could be himself while watching them. They were therapeutic, he said.\n\n\"They're an opportunity for us to to maybe face our own deaths without actually dying,\" Wylde said. \"It helps a lot.\"\n\nJC Wylde crafts mostly in his apartment in Regina, Sask. (Heidi Atter/CBC)\n\nWylde has been through difficult times. He has struggled with alcohol and drugs. He has been imprisoned. He said it wasn't until he started sculpting that he truly made a change.\n\nIn 2007, Wylde saw some handcrafted masks based on some of his favourite horror icons online. He decided he wanted to learn how to make them himself.\n\nFinding this was one of the things that saved me. - JC Wylde, Creeping Death Productions\n\n\"I had never touched clay before. I had never painted on anything before, so it was all brand new,\" Wylde said. \"I just went out and bought everything and just said 'I'm going to try it.'\"\n\nSculpting made it easier to stay home instead of going out drinking, he said. He filled his days by refining his skills and was able to see he had talent and worth, he said.\n\nJC Wylde hopes to inspire others through his art. (Heidi Atter/CBC)\n\n\"It's very therapeutic. It's very stress relieving and I cannot think of a place I feel more comfortable than when I'm sculpting or painting,\" Wylde said. \"Finding this was one of the things that saved me.\"\n\nWylde said he has been getting praise from Hollywood, including the actors who play the characters he sculpts. He's made movie props and sells his sculptures around the world \u2014 mostly to the United States.\n\nJC Wylde's latest piece is a tribute to Captain Spaulding from Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses.
