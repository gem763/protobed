The Imperial family\u2019s own events used to be more modest,\u201d said historian and monarchy expert Eiichi Miyashiro, who is also a journalist.\n\nThe ceremony was originally modeled after one by the ancient Tang dynasty of China and is the second of a three-part process following the May succession. Next month sees the highly religious and divisive ritual of the Grand Harvest. Some experts have raised questions over the government\u2019s funding of 16 billion yen ($150 million) for ceremonies that contain religious rites.\n\n___\n\nA PROCLAMATION AND A BANZAI\n\nDespite the time, cost and effort put into it, the ceremony itself will last only 30 minutes. Its climax is the emperor\u2019s proclamation before some 2,000 guests.\n\nNaruhito will wear a formal brownish-orange robe that has been dyed in sappanwood and Japanese wax tree bark and a black headdress decorated with an upright tail - as his father did 30 years ago - in a ceremony at Matsu-no-ma, the Imperial Palace\u2019s most prestigious hall.\n\nHe will make his proclamation from the Imperial Throne \u201cTakamikura,\u201d a 6.5-meter (21-foot) -high decorative structure resembling a gazebo or something from the Forbidden City in China. It was transported from the former Imperial Palace in Japan\u2019s ancient capital of Kyoto, where emperors lived until 150 years ago.\n\nA sword and a jewel - two of the \u201cthree sacred treasures\u201d that Naruhito has inherited from Akihito - will be placed beside him, while the third treasure, a mirror, stays at the Ise Shrine, the holiest place in the Shinto religion.\n\nNaruhito\u2019s wife, Empress Masako, also dressed in an elaborate traditional costume, will stand in a slightly smaller structure, the \u201cAugust Seat of the Empress,\u201d a modern-day addition first used by Naruhito\u2019s grandmother.\n\nNaruhito is expected to follow a 1990 proclamation made by his father, who pledged to fulfill his duty as a state symbol under the constitution and wished his people peace and prosperity. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, after making a brief congratulatory statement, will lead three \u201cbanzai\u201d cheers for Naruhito.\n\n___\n\n\u2018REIWA\u2019 STYLE\n\nNaruhito and Masako have been warmly welcomed by the Japanese public.\n\nThe couple won praise when they chatted with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump without an interpreter at a banquet in May.\n\nNaruhito has pledged to follow his father\u2019s commitment to pacifism and sympathy for those facing hardship.\n\nNaruhito is a historian, a viola player and an expert on water transport who studied at Oxford. Masako, a Harvard-educated former diplomat, has struggled for more than 10 years since developing \u201cadjustment disorder\u201d after giving birth to their only child, Princess Aiko, and facing pressure to produce a boy.\n\n___\n\nTOYOTA, NOT ROLLS ROYCE\n\nNaruhito is largely following his father\u2019s examples, but not in the choice of a royal car for his parade.\n\nWhile Akihito used a Rolls Royce Corniche III imported from Britain 30 years ago, Naruhito and Masako will be in a Toyota Century convertible, customized with raised rear seats to provide well-wishers a good view from the roadside during the couple\u2019s half-hour motorcade on the 4.6-kilometer (3-mile) route from the palace to the Akasaka imperial residence.\n\nThe parade, originally planned for Tuesday afternoon, was pushed back to Nov. 10 due to the extensive damage from Typhoon Hagibis, which hit central and northern Japan earlier this month.\n\n___\n\nPARDONS\n\nTo mark the occasion, Abe\u2019s Cabinet is granting pardons to about 550,000 people convicted of petty crimes such as traffic violations and election fraud. The pre-war custom of clemency by the emperor has triggered criticism as being undemocratic and politically motivated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anachronistic,\u201d said Setsu Kobayashi, a Keio University constitution professor. \u201cIf their penalties need to be reconsidered or reduced, they should be examined individually and legally, not in the name of the emperor.\u201d\n\nThe amnesty will take effect Tuesday. When Naruhito\u2019s grandfather Hirohito died in 1989, more than 10 million people were pardoned, and 2.5 million were given amnesty to celebrate Akihito\u2019s enthronement.\n\n___\n\nCOURT BANQUETS\n\nNaruhito will host a 3\u00bd-hour court banquet Tuesday night, attended by foreign dignitaries and representatives from Japan\u2019s administrative, legislative and judicial branches and their spouses.\n\nForeign guests will be escorted to observe the Imperial Throne and the Empress\u2019 seat on display at the Pine Hall before entering the banquet hall, where a dinner will be served while traditional Japanese court music is performed live, ceremony organizers said.\n\nNaruhito and Masako will also have after-dinner drinks with foreign guests in another room. The couple will host three more banquets through the end of October.\n\n___\n\nABE\u2019S DIPLOMACY RUSH\n\nThe enthronement ceremony is also being used for diplomacy by Abe, who is separately hosting a dinner Wednesday, though Naruhito and Masako won\u2019t be there.\n\nGuests include Britain\u2019s Prince Charles, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon. Abe\u2019s expected meeting Thursday with Lee will be the highest-level talks between the two countries since tensions escalated in July over wartime history and trade controls.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Japan is abuzz ahead of a ceremony Tuesday marking Emperor Naruhito's ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mari Yamaguchi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/japan_enthronement_glance_87818_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
