Save up to $30: Instant Pots in three colors\n\nThis is the best Instant Pot deal we've seen in at least a month.

The classic black option is $20 off, but you can get the more recently released teal and white models for nearly $30 less than usual. These aren't the lowest prices we've ever seen, but Instant Pots always start to sell out as we get closer to the holiday season.
