Both episodes were cited in the censure resolution.\n\nRepublicans have also complained that Democrats are holding close-door depositions in their impeachment inquiry and have yet to formally authorize their probe, which has become their central argument in the impeachment fight.\n\n\u201cNo more secret proceedings. No more Soviet-style proceedings,\u201d Biggs said on the floor.\n\nRepublicans initially struggled to respond to allegations that Trump asked foreign leaders to dig up dirt on his political rivals, but the GOP has shifted their response to focus on process and procedure concerns as well as to demonize Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nAnd in the absence of a centralized defense strategy from the White House, GOP leaders have sought to fill the messaging void by hosting regular impeachment briefings for members featuring various special guests. The first briefing will take place Wednesday afternoon with Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a top Trump ally.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9c/62/b8265f5941149db63edee3e3fc2f/20191016-andy-biggs-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
