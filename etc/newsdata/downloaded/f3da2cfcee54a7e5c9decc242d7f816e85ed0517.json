It's the rare case,\" he said. \"Those are private conversations between world leaders. And it wouldn't be appropriate to do so, except in the most extreme circumstances. There's no evidence that that would be appropriate here at this point.\"\n\nRead more: Another whistleblower has come forward, this time alleging 'inappropriate efforts' to influence Trump's tax audit\n\nThe secretary of state was grilled again about the State Department's involvement in the Ukraine controversy on September 26 after the White House released a summary of the call.\n\nA reporter pointed out to Pompeo that Giuliani had publicly said the State Department asked him to get involved with Ukraine and reach out to Zelensky and his advisers: \"If so, what exactly was he told to do by the State Department, by whom? And just more broadly, the whistleblower complaint does not appear to suggest any allegation of impropriety from people in the State Department. Is that correct? Are you confident that none of your staff \u2014 that you or none of your staff did anything improper in this whole situation?\"\n\nAs a participant in the phone call at the center of the reporter's question, Pompeo was presumably well-positioned to shed light on his own involvement in the matter.\n\nBut he didn't, instead narrowing his answer to focus on the whistleblower's complaint, which had been released shortly before the news conference.\n\n\"I haven't had a chance to actually read the whistleblower complaint yet,\" Pompeo said. \"I read the first couple of paragraphs and then got busy today. But I'll ultimately get a chance to see it. If I understand it right, it's from someone who had secondhand knowledge.\"\n\nHe failed to mention, of course, that he had firsthand knowledge of the events described in the complaint.\n\nRead more: The White House is 'paralyzed' and 'teetering on the edge of a cliff' as it grapples with Ukraine fallout and 'Hurricane Rudy'\n\nPompeo's role in the controversy isn't limited to his participation in the Trump-Zelensky phone call. The secretary of state also appears to be intricately involved in efforts to prevent State Department officials from cooperating with the House of Representatives' formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pompeo sent a letter to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees, telling them their requests to depose department officials connected to the whistleblower's complaint are \"not feasible\" and \"do not provide adequate time for the Department and its employees to prepare\" for testimony.\n\n\"I'm concerned with aspects of the Committee's request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe added, \"Let me be clear: I will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers hit back shortly after, telling Pompeo \"any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2014 including State Department employees \u2014 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nThey also accused Pompeo of \"intimidating Department witnesses\" to shield himself and Trump from scrutiny. They added that Pompeo's participation in the Zelensky call made him \"a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nThe public will likely get more details about Pompeo's alleged efforts in the near future. The State Department's inspector general, Steve Linick, on Tuesday requested an \"urgent\" briefing with lawmakers to \"discuss and provide staff with copies of documents related to the State Department and Ukraine.\"\n\nPBS NewsHour's Yamiche Alcindor reported shortly before Linick's testimony on Wednesday that it would center around \"retaliation against State Department officials who are trying to cooperate with House Democrats.\"", "description": "Pompeo made at least four misleading statements in recent days about his knowledge of the contents of a whistleblower's complaint about the call.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5aa81c073be59f22008b464f?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
