One-bedroom apartments with a study are selling for $450,000 and advertise $450 rent a week, also 5 per cent.\n\nBuyers are also being offered $20,000 cash \u201cincentives\u201d.\n\nMany developers are also upgrading bathroom and kitchen fixtures and offering high-end furniture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent research found that Melbourne high-rise apartment prices are underperforming houses by more than 50 per cent in most suburbs over the past 10 years because of concerns about construction defects.\n\nHouse prices grew by an average of more than 90 per cent compared with less than half of that for high rises, according to the analysis by Propertyology. In Sydney, high-rise apartments underperformed by more than 50 per cent.\n\nBut the commissions appear to be less than when the entire residential market was struggling because of low auction clearance rates, falling prices and tough lending conditions, despite low rates.\n\nDevelopers were earlier this year offering advisers commissions of nearly 10 per cent, or up to $90,000 plus GST for recommending a $1 million property.", "description": "The payments reflect a growing division in the nation's property markets between 'hot' stock in low-rise inner suburbs and hard-to-sell high-rise and outer suburban property.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_12/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ca1f095f367f65d4b1ffec3ad92daeb1fdb0f653", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
