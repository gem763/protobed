It ultimately led to their early deaths and crushed their spirits so brutally that the dogs \u201clost the will to work,\u201d the report says.\n\nAt least 10 dogs provided to Jordan died of \u201cvarious medical problems\u201d out of at least 100 canines sent there between 2008 and 2016, the report found, and surviving dogs were starved in kennels smeared with feces and dirt. Dogs were overworked in the desert, suffered hip dysplasia and other conditions. Engorged ticks ringed their ears.\n\nZoe, another Belgian Malinois, died of heat stroke on the Syrian border in 2017, less than a year after her arrival. Veterinarians told investigators that such deaths are not accidental and pointed to negligence on the part of Jordanian handlers.\n\nThe report reveals an alarming and fast collapse of dogs that arrived healthy and strong in Jordan, only to be fighting for their lives in a matter of months.\n\nMencey and Zoe were both dead before they marked a year of work. Athena, a 2-year old Belgian Malinois, was found starved in Jordan by U.S. dog handling officials and evacuated to the United States for recovery.\n\nPhotos in Jordan show Athena\u2019s malnourished body. Feces covered her kennel floor, her water bowl bone-dry. The State Department had two full-time dog handling mentors on the ground \u201cduring the entire time\u201d Athena was in Jordan, the report found, but her condition did not set off any alarms until a site visit in April 2018.\n\nBy then, the State Department knew for two years \u2014 after an April 2016 site visit \u2014 that Jordan was unable to adequately care for and protect dogs carrying out dirty, hot and dangerous work to find explosives in violent places like the Syrian border.\n\nYet at least 60 dogs arrived in six waves through 2018 after the assessment, the report found, including Mencey, Zoe and Athena.\n\nThe site visit to a Jordanian police facility concluded that dogs were under constant threat of parvo, a deadly gastrointestinal illness, and were worked well past their retirement age, the report found.\n\n\u201cThe police are losing canines frequently to the disease and do not have the medical care required to treat it, or even maintain healthy canines,\u201d officials wrote in their assessment. \u201cThe training observed was well below the needed methods to maintain a minimal standard.\u201d\n\nSeveral canines had hip dysplasia and arthritis, they wrote, \u201cand have lost the will to work.\u201d\n\nA visit to another facility revealed other bleak conditions. \u201cThe teams are additionally over worked, and required to search large numbers of vehicles without proper shelter, sanitation, and care,\u201d the officials wrote.\n\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), a member of the State Department and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, called on the State Department to immediately take steps to ensure dogs it has provided overseas are treated humanely.\n\n\u201cThe funds we provide to help countries like Jordan locate and remove unexploded bombs has saved countless lives,\u201d Leahy told The Washington Post. \u201cBomb sniffing dogs are indispensable to that process, they cost a lot of money to train, and their lives are put at risk every day in the field. It is imperative that they are properly cared for.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has sent explosive detection canines to partner nations for two decades, relying heavily on dogs provided and trained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In 2016, the State Department established its own facility, the Canine Validation Center, in Winchester, Va., staffed by contractors, the report said.\n\nA 30-day foreign handler course for 15 trained dogs costs approximately $450,000, including the provisions of those animals, the report said.\n\nIn a statement, the State Department said it has taken action on four of the five recommendations made by investigators, including more clearly defined operating procedures and agreements on canine care and treatment.\n\nFind the bomb! Good boy! Man\u2019s best friend may be our best bet for staying safe.\n\nThe agency said it provided written strategic health and welfare plans to Jordan as part of the recommended actions, though it did not provide any proof to investigators, the report said.\n\nA State Department official declined to say if it was confident in the safety and welfare of dogs bound for Jordan in the future.\n\nThe agency also disagreed with the investigative recommendation that the program should be halted in Jordan to implement plans to ensure the health and welfare of the animals.\n\nIt responded in the report that it could not halt the program because of \u201cnational security related efforts focused on protecting American interests\u201d and because \u201cassisting Jordan in combating active terrorist threats would be negatively impacted by such a move.\u201d\n\nInvestigators balked at that defense, suggesting that mistreatment harmed their ability to detect threats in the first place.\n\n\u201cCanines lose their effectiveness when their quality of life is poor,\u201d the report said in response.\n\nThe United States had provided 169 to 189 active working dogs to nine countries as of September 2018, the report found: Bahrain, Egypt, Indonesia, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Jordan and Oman. Jordan received by far the highest number, with 89 active dogs.\n\nBut no one really knows exactly how many because of \u201cinsufficient and contradictory documentation,\u201d the report found. Dogs were also provided to the Dominican Republic and Afghanistan, but the program \u201cdoes not maintain documents related to the welfare of dogs in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nAgency officials said in the report that it has improved focus on canine care, and in 2018, sent a veterinarian and a veterinary technician to Jordan for a year at a cost of $540,000. Other handler/mentor deployments will cost millions.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\n3 trainers accused of using cayenne pepper to get show dogs to perform.
