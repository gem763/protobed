This was on my mind during the penultimate stop on our Peruvian adventure, in the now less-trammelled Colca Valley.\n\nIt\u2019s a region that was off the tourist path for over a decade in the Eighties and Nineties while controlled by the Maoist guerrilla group Shining Path, but which is now gradually returning to itineraries.\n\nWe\u2019d left our tranquil room at the Belmond hideaway Las Casitas to a deafening dawn chorus of birdsong. Now, an hour\u2019s drive later under a cloud-scattered sky, we were watching condors line up like jets at Heathrow on a Monday morning, swooping one by one over our heads with a whoosh of their giant wings as they surfed the currents above the depths of the Colca Canyon, the second-deepest land canyon in the world.\n\nOur two-week itinerary had taken us to the heights of the Inca Trail and through the Sacred Valley on a luxury train. We had travelled across Lake Titicaca to visit ancient civilisations and, lastly, embarked on a gourmet adventure in the Peruvian capital Lima. Each new day only transported us to further heights.\n\nIf Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos has his way and Earth is designated a residential zone, then Peru will certainly qualify in a top five of global recreational parks. With its awe-inducing Andean peaks dropping abruptly down to desert, culminating in a surf-bashed rocky coastline, this is a country of epic scale.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mariella Frostrup"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/September/peru-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
