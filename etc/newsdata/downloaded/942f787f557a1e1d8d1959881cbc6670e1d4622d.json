The supply of certain types of fresh foods and essential medicines would decrease, prices would go up and poor people would be hit hardest, it said.\n\nThe paper also describes major disruption for travelers between Britain and the EU, uncertainty for U.K. citizens living in Europe, and says attempts to maintain an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would probably fail. It also says a no-deal exit could trigger major protests and even riots.\n\nThe government refused to comply with another part of Parliament\u2019s demand \u2014 that it hand over emails and texts among officials and aides discussing the government\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament for more than a month before the Brexit deadline. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, said the request was inappropriate and disproportionate.\n\nJohnson insists the country must leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a divorce deal to smooth the way. But many lawmakers fear a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating, and are determined to stop him.\n\nOpposition lawmakers and rebel Conservatives have dealt the government\u2019s Brexit plans a series of blows. They passed a law that orders the government to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if no agreement has been reached by late October, rejected Johnson\u2019s call for a snap general election and ordered the release of the Yellowhammer document.\n\nThen on Tuesday, Johnson suspended Parliament for five weeks until Oct. 14, sparking outrage among legislators and several legal challenges.\n\nThe U.K. Supreme Court is set to consider next week whether the shutdown should be reversed, after conflicting rulings in lower courts.\n\nLast week, the High Court in London said the decision was inherently political and \u201cnot a matter for the courts.\u201d But Scotland\u2019s highest civil court ruled Wednesday that the shutdown was illegal \u201cbecause it had the purpose of stymieing Parliament.\u201d\n\nA court in Northern Ireland is due to rule on a related case Thursday, and the Supreme Court is set to make the final decision after a hearing next week.\n\nJohnson says he suspended Parliament so that he can launch a fresh domestic agenda at a new session next month. He said he had \u201cabsolutely not\u201d misled Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 whose formal approval was needed to suspend Parliament \u2014 about his motives.\n\nJohnson said he was \u201cworking very hard\u201d to strike a new deal with the bloc after the agreement made by his predecessor Theresa May was rejected three times by Britain\u2019s Parliament.\n\nJohnson\u2019s envoy David Frost has been holding talks in Brussels this week but no breakthrough has been made, and the EU says it is still waiting for firm proposals from the U.K.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told reporters that \u201cwe are still ready to examine objectively any concrete and legally operational proposals from the U.K.\u201d", "description": "The British government insisted Thursday that its assessment there could be food and medicine shortages, gridlock at ports and riots in the streets if there...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR159_french_ZG_20190912061800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
