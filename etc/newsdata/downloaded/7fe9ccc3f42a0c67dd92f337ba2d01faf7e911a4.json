At least as to the argument that the current inquiry is invalid because there has been no formal vote by the House of Representatives, there should be little doubt that Cipollone is wrong. No such vote is necessary because the Constitution dictates no fixed process for impeachment investigations or trials. This know from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of Judge Walter L. Nixon\u2019s challenge to his impeachment more than twenty years ago.\n\nNixon was convicted on two counts of making false statements before a grand jury. The grand jury investigation followed reports that Nixon had \u201caccepted a gratuity from a Mississippi businessman in exchange for asking a local district attorney to halt the prosecution of the businessman\u2019s son.\u201d Even after he was sentenced, Nixon refused to resign his office as a United States District Court Judge. No resolution by the House authorized the subsequent investigation into Nixon. The House ultimately adopted three articles of impeachment, charging Nixon with giving false testimony and with \u201cbringing disrepute on the Federal Judiciary,\u201d and the Senate convicted him on the first two.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s involvement stemmed from a lawsuit Nixon filed in an effort to invalidate his impeachment. He argued that the Senate\u2019s process was defective because his conviction did not result from the kind of trial that resembled a judicial proceeding.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNixon pinned his hopes on the constitutional text authorizing the Senate to \u201ctry\u201d all impeachments. But the court noted that the word \u201ctry\u201d has multiple meanings \u2014 and it would not choose among them. Rather, the court concluded that the framers had assigned to the Senate the exclusive discretion to determine how best to adjudicate charges contained in duly adopted articles of impeachment. And, where the Constitution clearly makes such an assignment, it was not for the judiciary to second-guess the Senate\u2019s judgment about how to proceed in a particular case.\n\nThe court in Nixon v. United States accordingly confirmed that, when the Constitution expressly assigns to one department of government \u2013 or, in the case of impeachment, one part of one department \u2013 the responsibility for a particular function, that department can decide for itself how to fulfill its responsibility. While Nixon concerned the Senate\u2019s role in the impeachment process, the same reasoning applies to the House and the constitutional mandate that it \u201cshall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nIf the House has the sole discretion to adopt articles of impeachment, it follows that it has the discretion to determine how to launch and conduct any preceding inquiry and investigation. This conclusion finds support in another textual mandate in the constitution: that each House \u201cmay determine the Rules of its Proceedings.\u201d Notably, there is no impeachment exception to this provision.\n\nThat impeachment inquiries and investigations are left to the House\u2019s discretion makes sense. The House is the most democratically representative department of the federal government, and the framers reasonably could have concluded that no impeachment investigation would occur unless a majority of the House membership approved. Given the potential political obstacles to assembling a majority of the House to act on any matter, much less an issue as fraught as impeachment, the framers likely understood that the power to investigate and, potentially, adopt articles of impeachment would be used cautiously.\n\nConcurring in the Nixon court\u2019s judgment, Justice David Souter nonetheless suggested that an entirely arbitrary process by the Senate would raise constitutional concerns\u2014if, for example, the Senate decided whether to convict based upon a coin toss. Similar reasoning could be applied to the House: If a majority decided to adopt articles of impeachment absent any inquiry whatsoever into the underlying circumstances, it is not clear the House\u2019s judgment should be respected.\n\nBut it cannot be right that the impeachment process or its result should be deemed arbitrary simply because the president says so. In light of the publicly available evidence of the president\u2019s actions in respect to Ukraine, moreover, there is no good argument that the House has undertaken the current investigation on a whim. Indeed, the quantity of evidence suggests that, at this point, it would be constitutionally irresponsible for the House not to continue to pursue its investigation into whether the president\u2019s conduct qualifies as a high crime or misdemeanor.\n\nLawrence Friedman teaches constitutional law at New England Law | Boston and is the author, most recently, of the second edition of \u201cModern Constitutional Law.\u201d", "description": "The quantity of evidence suggests that, at this point, it would be constitutionally irresponsible for the House not to continue to pursue its investigation into whether the president\u2019s conduct qualifies as a high crime or misdemeanor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/memo_trumpimpeachmentdivision_092719hillillustration.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
