REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures were at $62.36 a barrel, down 3 cents, or 0.1%, from the previous close, by 0659 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were 9 cents lower, or 0.2%, to $56.40 a barrel.\n\nBrent and WTI prices have dropped 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively, since their close on Monday, weighed down by a surprise 2.4 million-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories last week, and a faster-than-expected recovery of Saudi output capacity after the Sept. 14 attacks on two of its oil processing plants.\n\nPrices found slight support on hopes that the U.S.-China trade dispute may ease, potentially boosting oil demand.\n\nU.S. President Trump said on Wednesday - a day after a stinging rebuke to China for its trade practices - that Beijing wanted to make a deal \u201cvery badly\u201d and that a deal \u201ccould happen sooner than you think\u201d.\n\nTrump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also signed a limited trade deal that would open up Japanese markets to some $7 billion worth of U.S. products annually.\n\nAnalysts said there was little else besides the slightly more positive outlook on the trade talks to help lift crude futures higher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not too much to be cheery about on oil markets today,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is restoring production much faster than expected (and) the EIA crude inventories came in higher,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Brent and WTI on Wednesday fell to their lowest since the attacks on Saudi Arabia.\n\nCrude futures were also pressured by sluggish economic data in leading European economies and Japan, analysts said.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, a much weaker than expected Germany manufacturer PMI data painted a tepid outlook for energy demand,\u201d said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\n\u201cThis bearish outlook is further strengthened by a rise in U.S. crude oil stockpile in the past weeks,\u201d said Yang.\n\nA firmer dollar .DXY, which posted its sharpest daily gain in three months overnight and held steady in Asian trade, also weighed on oil prices as it makes dollar-traded fuel imports more costly for countries using other currencies.\n\n\u201cBarring new inputs to adjust price expectations, both contracts are in grave danger of fully unwinding their Saudi attack rallies and retesting their pre-attack lows, around $60.00 (for Brent) and $54.00 (for WTI),\u201d Halley said.", "description": "Oil prices edged lower on Thursday, extending losses from the previous two sessions, as Saudi Arabia quickly regained production volumes after an attack on its oil facilities and amid increasing signs of slowing demand.", "authors": ["Roslan Khasawneh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433977828&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P03X", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
