As recently as the 50s it was branded \u201cthe shame of Italy\u201d, after a writer called Carlo Levi was exiled by Benito Mussolini\u2019s fascist regime to a town close to Matera in 1935. He was appalled by what he found \u2013 a level of poverty that made Dickensian London look luxurious. Residents lived in the caves, with big families and livestock crammed into one lightless hovel. Malaria was rife. There was no electricity, plumbing nor running water. Children died young either of disease or starvation. Not even Francis Bacon could have dreamt up such misery.\n\nLevi\u2019s book, Christ Stopped at Eboli, changed the course of Matera\u2019s history. The Italian authorities were forced to stop ignoring the issue, and relocated residents to a nearby rural development \u2013 a well-intentioned, but ill-conceived idea that failed to acknowledge the nuances of Materan life and many displaced locals found it difficult to adjust to their new conditions. It looked as if ancient Matera, possibly the third oldest city in the world after Aleppo and Jericho, had finally been abandoned.\n\nBut then the creatives moved in, many of which were children and grandchildren of those who had been moved out of the caves, led by a group of young people called La Scaletta, who made it their mission to uphold Materan cultural traditions and heritage. It turned out that the ruined rock churches and caves made for great art exhibition spaces, and the reputation of the town took a positive twist. It transpired that the poor were worth saving, after all. In 1993, it was given UNESCO World Heritage Site status. Filmmakers began to see the potential of a largely empty hilltop Italian town \u2013 especially one as good-looking as Matera - and it was used as the setting for ancient Jerusalem, including Mel Gibson\u2019s Passion of the Christ (2004) and Timur Bekmambetov's Ben-Hur (2016). Since then, its featured in Wonder Woman and will also have a starring role in the new Bond film \u2013 exposure that will doubtlessly boost the city\u2019s fortunes. The breadth of Matera\u2019s achievement, from slum to a cultural hub, is staggering.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of attractiveness, Matera is supermodel-level beautiful. It\u2019s not easy to stand your ground in a country as madly photogenic as Italy, the place that invented Botticelli, Positano, Sofia Loren, and Tuscany\u2019s sexy curves. Even its numerous varieties of policemen wear the most beautiful uniforms in the world. But this hilltop tangle of sand-coloured alleys is beyond compare. Depending on your cultural preferences, it looks like a cross between Jim Henson\u2019s Labyrinth or MC Escher\u2019s Relativity print. In fact, the latter\u2019s lithograph inspired Henson\u2019s cult film. This maze-like golden city is like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen to before, in Italy or otherwise. Houses tumble down the hillsides, stacked on top of one another, the limestone broken by late summer flowers and terraces with creeping vines. These sit on top of millennia-old caves that have been excavated and transformed into varying levels of luxury hotels that perch on the edge of a ravine. The paths are narrow and windingly confusing, the steps are wonky and worn-down, sometimes leading to tunnels and caverns, or sheltered by Romanesque flying buttresses. There are very few secret fairytale destinations left on earth, but Matera is as close as it gets.\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThere is no shortage of places to stay in Matera \u2013 Airbnb occupies a big chunk of the rental market \u2013 but without doubt the most luxurious hotel is Sextantio le Grotte della Civita, a 13th century church and 18 former cave dwellings. It took owner Daniele Kihlgren 10 years to painstakingly renovate the three-floor plot into impeccable high-end accommodation that imbues restrained elegance of the highest level.\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nLike so much of the restoration of Matera, a great deal of effort has gone into making sure that the grottos preserve their original character \u2013 underfloor heating, electricity and plumbing have been installed in each of room, but not before every flagstone was numbered, lifted and replaced back to its original location, ensuring that the traditional design remains intact The high-ceilinged rooms vary in size, but each is sensuously lit by beeswax candles and beds are made with local Italian linen. The antique wood furniture is all sourced from Matera and from its neighbouring towns, yet even the few touches of modernity \u2013 for example the huge, egg-shaped Philippe Starck bathtubs \u2013 blend perfectly with the simplicity of these cavernous spaces. You\u2019ll never sleep more deeply than at Sextantio, enhanced by flickering candles and cool air, where the sun is kept out by thick stone walls and a heavy wooden door.\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nThe consecrated church is now a breakfast room, offering an impressive morning spread with Matera\u2019s famed breads, along with locally-made delicious pastries, fruits and cheeses. The understated, sun-dappled stone terrace overlooking a ravine is the perfect spot to enjoy a glass of wine or an Aperitivo. Sextantio could have gone overboard and dressed up its caves like a Christmas tree, but it chose not to. The result is a true architectural accomplishment that blends style with simplicity.\n\nWhat to see\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from a city crowned a culture capital, there are a lot of excellent museum and gallery spaces in Matera. Start with Casa Noha \u2013 named after the Noble family who used to live there - which documents the city\u2019s story from ancient times through to its crisis point in the 50s and ending at its recent renaissance. Using video as its medium, the powerful, tear-jerking retelling is projected onto the walls, floors and ceiling of the rooms, and communicates just how impressive the city\u2019s journey has been.\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nEveryone will tell you to go to MUSMA, the contemporary sculpture gallery located in a 16thcentury former family home, and you should. The brainchild of the La Scaletta (the group pf artists who first came together in the late 60s), MUSMA houses the work of artists, both local and international, in atmospheric caverns. Lesser known but just as fascinating is Casa Ortega, which is dedicated to Spanish artist Jos\u00e8 Ortega. After moving to Matera, Ortega was inspired by the ancient papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 techniques employed by local craftsmen and it became his speciality \u2013 think Picasso crossed with Matisse, creating bold, often colourful works that acted as social commentary. Public art has a rightful place in Matera and its 2019 cultural celebrations include five giant Salvador Dal\u00ed reproductions scattered around the town.\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nDon\u2019t leave Matera without visiting La Palomba \u2013 an abstract sculpture park, situated in an abandoned quarry at the foot of the city, obscured from the surrounding roads. It was first conceived in 2013, when world-famous sculptor Antonio Paradiso hosted an exhibition there, sparking the idea for an open-air art space. His sculptures, some of which use the rubble of 9/11, are still on display, alongside works from five other artists inspired by the region of Basilicata. Free from crowds, this surreal spectacle is best visited at sunset when the twisted metal structures and esoteric works, are showered in golden light. The space is also used for live music and light shows, so keep your eye on what\u2019s happening when you visit.\n\nWhere to eat and drink\n\nMatera sits in the quiet terrain of Basilicata, and its restaurants boast classics of the region \u2013 a type of Lucanica sausage seasoned with salt, pepper and fennel seeds; Matera bread made with local grains that tastes like a more intense version of sourdough; and handmade Orecchiette pasta, shaped like little ears.\n\nFor excellent typical food head to Osteria al Casale, based in a high ceilinged cave with a terrace that stretches out onto a piazza. Chef Fabio Paolicelli is truly passionate about preserving the culinary traditions of the region, and his orecchiette pasta with turnip-tops and anchovies is not to be missed. The Scialatielli pasta served with cardoncelli mushrooms, cheese and sweet pepper of Senise is another mouthwatering treat, but make sure you make room for the house dessert \u2013 the whipped ricotta, fig and hazelnut mousse. For another atmospheric, charming restaurant with excellent food, visit Trattoria del Caveoso, which is built into the rock face. Try the caprese salad and the simply-made sausage pasta, washed down with local Aglianico wine. The staff here are excellent, imbuing the signature conviviality that Italians are known for.\n\nPhoto credit: Poppy Hollis More\n\nPhoto credit: Courtesy More\n\nDon\u2019t miss Area 8, unarguably Matera\u2019s coolest bar. An agency and production house by day and a lively caf\u00e9 and bar by night, Area 8 is a meeting point for filmmakers, actors and locals \u2013 both Wes Anderson, L\u00e9a Seydoux and Joaquin Phoenix have been spotted there. Its owner, Mikeala Bandit, has impeccable taste, sourcing furniture from all over the world. Outside on the terrace, a permanently parked 1955 Piaggio Ape scooter serves as a DJ booth, while inside sits an eclectic array of vintage furniture \u2013 from leather armchairs and a 70s lava lamp tables to wooden bookcases and elegant candelabras. A cinema, hidden within a vaulted cave, hosts films screenings. If you\u2019re looking for the perfect place to sip cocktails and snack on light bites, then Area 8 is an ideal spot.\n\nPrestige Holidays offers a week\u2019s stay at Sextantio Le Grotte Della Civita from \u00a3869 per person (November departure) including return flights from Stansted to Bari on Ryanair and accommodation in a classic cave on BB plus private resort transfers.
