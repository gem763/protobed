And other Democrats who relied on traditional, big-dollar fundraisers also slipped, presaging difficulties financing robust campaigns.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris\u2019 reported haul of $11.6 million came in slightly lower than her second quarter. And though South Bend Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg posted $19.1 million, that number was down, too, from the previous three months, when he raised $24.8 million.\n\n\u201cThe fact that progressives combined to raise $50 million without one fundraiser is mind-boggling,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant who advised Cynthia Nixon in her primary campaign against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo last year. \u201cAnd really exciting, because they showed there\u2019s a better way to do this.\u201d\n\nThe quarterly fundraising reports marked a victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. And its effects were felt more broadly than on the candidates\u2019 bottom lines. Freed from the time constraints of traditional fundraising, Warren spent hours in photograph lines at campaign events throughout the summer, while Sanders \u2014 before his hospitalization this week \u2014 maintained a frenetic pace on the trail.\n\nAnd as the campaign accelerates this fall, Warren and Sanders are poised to compound the effect of their small donors. Unlike contributors who give the maximum amount at exclusive donor events, small-dollar contributors can re-up repeatedly.\n\n\u201cAnybody whose core model is big-money fundraisers will get tapped out at some point and have diminishing returns,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, \u201cwhereas 10- and 20-dollar donors can keep coming back to the table over and over again.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

The latest Morning Consult survey put him at 32 percent, with Warren and Sanders at 21 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\n\nWilliam Owen, a Democratic National Committee member from Tennessee who has endorsed Biden, said that despite \u201ca huge amount of money\u201d for both Sanders and Warren, \u201cJoe is still in the lead with the voters.\u201d\n\nAnd the flurry of financial reports suggested an opening at the periphery of the top tier for other candidates. Sen. Cory Booker raised more than $6 million in the third quarter amid a surge of support in late September. Businessman Andrew Yang raised $10 million. And Harris\u2019 campaign said it has nearly that much on hand.\n\n\u201cThis is where the campaign season, I think, takes on a different kind of urgency,\u201d Buttigieg said when he arrived at a gun control forum in Las Vegas this week. \u201cSomething about fall, I think, brings a certain focus to it.\u201d\n\nVoters, Buttigieg said, are \u201creally getting into decision mode.\u201d\n\nLesser-fundraising candidates \u2013 and many observers \u2013 can recount a litany of well-funded candidates who have failed before in presidential elections. And Matt Bennett of the center-left group Third Way, said Friday that the 2020 primary may require less money than most elections.\n\n\u201cIn a primary like this one where the frontrunners have pretty significant name ID,\u201d he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t need to introduce themselves to voters.\u201d\n\nBiden, Warren and Sanders will all have enough money to fund robust field operations, he said, and \u201cbeyond that, the marginal difference between $25 million and $15 million, I think, is relatively small.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think the money matters in the second tier, but it matters less at the top tier,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, online fundraising can fluctuate wildly. While Warren\u2019s ascent has proved relatively steady \u2013 what Gretchen Dahlkemper, a Democratic strategist based in Philadelphia, described as \u201clike a duck \u2026 kicking underneath and keeping calm\u201d \u2014 other candidates who have relied on small donations have faltered.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, who has not yet announced his third-quarter fundraising, raised more than $80 million in his near-miss Texas Senate run last year and followed that with $6.1 million in the 24 hours after he announced his presidential campaign in March. But by July, O'Rourke \u2014 who like many candidates relies on a mix of online and traditional fundraisers \u2014 reported a dismal $3.6 million in the second quarter.\n\nLes Francis, a Democratic strategist and former deputy White House chief of staff in the Carter administration, said it is an open question \u201cwhether or not there\u2019s a ceiling to that progressive donor base. In other words, does it get exhausted at some point? And, I don\u2019t know the answer to that. We\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, for centrists, Biden\u2019s figures are \u201ctroubling when you combine it with the numbers of the other so-called moderates in the race.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy definition, moderates are hard to get excited,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThat reveals itself not only in fundraising, but in volunteer activity and all the rest.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3f/0c/6ae6d0f2483fbb6ec4de05a27bc0/190826-sanders-warren-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
