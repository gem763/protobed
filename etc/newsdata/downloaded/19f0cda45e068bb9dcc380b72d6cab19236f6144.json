It won't deliver certainty and the people should have the final say,\" Corbyn said.\n\nHe had earlier reiterated that Labour MPs would vote against the revised withdrawal agreement in a post on Twitter.\n\nBoris Johnson's sell-out deal risks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers' rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US corporations.\n\n\n\nToday, @UKLabour will reject it. \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) October 19, 2019\n\nTime to 'move on': Johnson\n\nOpening the session with a statement urging MPs to back his deal, Johnson said it was time to \"move on and build a new relationship\" with Europe.\n\nHe added that the new withdrawal agreement could help heal the rift in British politics opened up by the country's 2016 referendum on membership of the EU, saying any further delay to Brexit would be \"pointless, expensive [and] corrosive\".\n\n\"I hope ... that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us,\" Johnson said.\n\nSpeaker selects Letwin amendment for debate\n\nThe speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, said he had selected for a vote a proposal to withhold support for Johnson's Brexit deal until formal ratification legislation has passed.\n\nThe amendment was put forward by former Conservative MP Oliver Letwin and is backed by a cross-party alliance of opposition MPs. If it passes, it would force Johnson to request an extension to Brexit by the end of Saturday.\n\nRead more about the amendment in our explainer on Saturday's special parliamentary session, here.\n\nBrexiteer MP tells Conservative faction to back deal\n\nSteve Baker, the head of a hardline Brexit faction in Johnson's Conservative Party, has told his European Research Group (ERG) eurosceptic allies that they should vote for the prime minister's Brexit deal.\n\n\"Vote for Boris's deal in the national interest,\" Baker told ERG members in a post on Twitter.\n\nERG advice to MPs:\n\n\n\n1. vote for Boris's deal in the national interest\n\n\n\n2. support the legislation to completion in good faith, provided it is not spoiled by opponents of Brexit\n\n\n\n3. vote with Boris throughout to give him maximum opportunity to deliver for our country https://t.co/WKPwBP5Yz8 \u2014 Steve Baker MP (@SteveBakerHW) October 19, 2019\n\nUK has no intention of asking for longer Brexit transition, minister says\n\nBritain has no intention of extending the transition period that follows Brexit past the current December 2020 end date, Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said.\n\n\"We have no intention of going beyond December 2020,\" Barclay told BBC News.\n\nAsked if Prime Minister Boris Johnson would ask the European Union to delay Brexit past the current October 31 deadline if the law required it, Barclay said Johnson would comply with the law.\n\nDUP will consider backing amendment to Brexit deal\n\nJohnson's Northern Irish allies will consider backing an amendment which would delay any immediate decision on the British prime minister's Brexit deal when it comes before parliament.\n\n\"Were going to look at that very closely,\" Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), told BBC radio when asked if they would support the amendment put forward by expelled Conservative lawmaker, Oliver Letwin.\n\nThe DUP had already said it would not vote in favour of the deal because of its customs implications for Northern Ireland.\n\nRead previous updates here.", "description": "UK parliament to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's newly-brokered Brexit deal with the European Union.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/993d0c3794374b019f3dbea7fb97a1d8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
