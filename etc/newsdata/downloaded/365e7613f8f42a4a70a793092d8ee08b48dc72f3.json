They're for sale as a set for $50 million.\n\n\"The ranches are beautiful, but when you combine them, we're combining a modern Western lifestyle [in Arizona]... with an 'Old West' lifestyle in Montana,\" Morton told Business Insider in 2018, when the ranches were first listed. \"Montana is essentially very much like the 'Old West' was, and Scottsdale's the 'New West.' When you combine them, you can live both lifestyles.\"\n\nBut the younger generation doesn't seem to be as interested in the ranch lifestyle.\n\nMillennials aren't buying baby boomers' sprawling ranches, leaving a glut of luxury ranches for sale out west, as Business Insider's Hillary Hoffower previously reported.\n\nThe two ranches the Fleischers are selling, which span about 7,100 acres combined, have been sitting on the market for over a year.\n\nThe package includes the MorDo Ranch in Scottsdale and Horsethief Basin Ranch just outside of Lewistown, Montana as a joint listing by Walt Danley Realty in Scottsdale and PureWest Real Estate in Bozeman, Montana, as exclusive affiliates of Christie's International Real Estate.\n\nAll of the equipment and staff on both ranches will stay on for the buyer. \"This is a package,\" Morton said. \"It's all set for them. They don't have to do anything.\"\n\nHere's a look at the two ranches.", "description": "For $50 million, you can buy two luxury ranches in Montana and Arizona that span a total of 7,100 acres \u2014 here's what the money will get you.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ba2baf9b354cdc3048b546b-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
