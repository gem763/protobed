I think we have to be careful about how we draw judgement on the performance.\"\n\nAfter her 1,500m triumph on Saturday, Hassan said she was winning races well before she joined the NOP in 2016.\n\n\"It was a very tough week and I had a lot of things in my head but I have a good manager and he really supported me,\" Hassan said. \"I show the world I am a clean athlete.\"", "description": "Watchdog will take close look at USADA report into Salazar ban: Coe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF96004_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
