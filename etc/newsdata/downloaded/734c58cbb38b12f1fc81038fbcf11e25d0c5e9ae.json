It\u2019s @jerseymikes, not Fallujah,\u201d @CombatCavScout captioned the photo. \u201cYou think you need a 1911 and an M&P to get a sub, but the thing that\u2019s gonna kill you is cholesterol. Also, zero retention on that M&P. If I could walk up behind you in line and take your gun, you shouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nAs the tweet started gathering steam, Jersey Mike\u2019s fired off at least eight responses making light of the situation, Business Insider reported.\n\n\u201cIf the laws were up to us, we\u2019d make it so everyone had to eat Jersey Mike\u2019s Subs on Sunday,\u201d the sandwich chain wrote.\n\nThe tweets have since been deleted, but not before Mr. Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, took notice.\n\n\u201cAs most who follow me know, my daughter was a victim of gun violence,\u201d Mr. Guttenberg tweeted. \u201c@jerseymikes, I will never eat in one of your restaurants again. Mocking the desire of customers to be safe when eating is a bad idea. Thankfully, the laws are not up to you.\n\n\u201cHere is a photo of the customer that started this. @jerseymikes should ban open carry in their restaurants and here is why,\u201d he added. \u201cThis customer was to incompetent to even properly secure this weapon and @jerseymikes turn that into a joke. Somebody could have died because of this.\u201d\n\nHere is a photo of the customer that started this. @jerseymikes should ban open carry in their restaurants and here is why.

We apologize. We always want to do better,\u201d Jersey Mike\u2019s tweeted. The company has not made any other statements regarding the controversy.\n\nMr. Guttenberg told Business Insider that he has not heard further from Jersey Mike\u2019s, \u201cother than the unacceptable form response.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy advice to them would be to take this more seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThis customer could have gotten somebody killed. Failure to address this with a policy change will not only lead to loss of customers but increased liability as they are on record as choosing to do nothing but joke about it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
