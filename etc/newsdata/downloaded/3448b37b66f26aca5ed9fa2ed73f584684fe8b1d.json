Barnum of America.\"\n\nAfter the election, the self-made billionaire felt he could help the country by becoming a trusted confidant to the new President and his team.\n\n\"If the goal is to help your country, it is almost always worth doing,\" he writes.\n\nIt worked.\n\nIt's clear that Trump respects Schwarzman immensely, according to former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett.\n\n\"During White House meetings on trade, Trump and others on his economic team would regularly quote from conversations they had with Schwarzman,\" said Hassett, now a CNN contributor.\n\nThe White House did not comment.\n\nIn some ways, Schwarzman is the perfect intermediary between America and its biggest trading partners. Over the last decade, he earned the trust and respect of world leaders, especially in China, where Schwarzman has extensive business and philanthropic ties. Schwarzman also has fans on the American side.\n\nSchwarzman is good friends with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The two men are neighbors -- both have apartments in the same New York City building, writes Schwarzman. And the two are among the only free trade advocates left among the President's inner circle, especially after the departure of White House economic advisor Gary Cohn.\n\nYet even with the advice of experienced Wall Street veterans, Trump has found himself unable to close many deals, instead sowing chaos and uncertainty in his many negotiations.\n\nDuring talks over a replacement for the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, Canadian and Mexican officials emailed and tested their ideas on Schwarzman before raising them directly with the administration, Schwarzman writes. In 2018, when the three countries reached an impasse, Schwarzman privately warned Trump about the dangers of fighting a multifront trade war with Asia, Europe and the Americas.\n\nThe rest of the world's economies \"would figure out a way to band together and make us miserable,\" Schwarzman says he told Trump. He advised that the US should start cutting some deals, beginning with NAFTA.\n\nBut Trump's replacement deal, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, is stalled in Congress, and his threat to pull out of NAFTA unilaterally still looms.\n\nSimilarly, Schwarzman was hopeful the United States and China could agree to a trade deal early on and avert a full-scale clash. In his book, Schwarzman describes meeting with top Chinese brass in an attempt to defuse economic tensions. He tried to explain the US position to the Chinese officials, including to China's President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn 2018 alone, Schwarzman made eight trips to China on behalf of the administration, he writes.\n\nThe ties between Schwarzman and the Chinese government run deep. China's newly created sovereign wealth fund announced a $3 billion investment in Blackstone ahead of the firm's IPO in 2007. In exchange, the Chinese government received nonvoting shares that amounted to a roughly 10% stake in the firm. In 2018, China's fund sold its stake, ending an 11 year investment in the firm.\n\nBut Schwarzman describes several instances when the Chinese felt exhausted and slighted. They wanted to understand why US perceptions of China had changed so drastically.\n\nSchwarzman writes that he helped broker a Chinese visit to Washington last September. But three days before the scheduled talks, President Trump announced new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\n\"It was another huge blow,\" write Schwarzman. \"The Chinese lost face and told me they didn't know what to do or whom to trust anymore.\"", "description": "Billionaire dealmaker Stephen Schwarzman, the head of Blackstone Group, thought after the 2016 election that he could help Donald Trump navigate some of the most complex negotiations in history.", "authors": ["Cristina Alesci", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190619100404-stephen-schwarzman-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
