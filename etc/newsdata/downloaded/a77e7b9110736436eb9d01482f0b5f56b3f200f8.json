It will now probably move up their agenda. Anger at Mr Johnson for \u201cshutting down parliament\u201d might persuade some Tory MPs to support the move as a last resort.\n\nThe problem: there is no agreement on who should take over as caretaker prime minister if a no-confidence vote succeeds. Mr Corbyn would not have the support of a majority of MPs. If no alternative PM emerges within 14 days, a general election would be held \u2013 and Mr Johnson would choose the date. He would opt for a November poll \u2013 so the UK would leave the EU during the campaign.\n\nLegislation\n\nUntil Mr Johnson\u2019s dramatic move, the preferred option of no-deal opponents was to pass a law forcing him to seek an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership. Although it will now be difficult to create enough parliamentary time for a bill to pass the Commons and Lords, MPs have not given up hope. They will probably try to seize control of Commons business when MPs return from their summer break on Tuesday.\n\nThe Queen\n\nMr Corbyn asked the Queen for a meeting before she granted Mr Johnson\u2019s request to prorogue parliament. Despite that, it was approved. Buckingham Palace and the civil service will continue to keep the monarch above the political fray: the rule is that she takes advice from her prime minister, so that any criticism is directed at them. The Queen is unlikely to intervene.\n\nThe courts\n\nAn attempt by more than 70 MPs and peers to stop parliament being prorogued before Brexit was already underway in Scotland\u2019s Court of Session. The politicians will now ask for a hearing due on 6 September to be speeded up. Labour\u2019s legal advice suggests that suspending parliament is unlawful. It is based on the 2017 Supreme Court ruling, in a case brought by the campaigner Gina Miller, that parliament rather than the government had the authority to implement the 2016 referendum decision. However, Downing Street argues that it is normal practice for parliament to be prorogued before a Queen\u2019s Speech, saying MPs will still have ample time to debate Brexit before 31 October.\n\nLegal experts believe Mr Johnson\u2019s move takes the UK into uncharted constitutional waters. The Supreme Court may soon have to make another important ruling.\n\nThe speaker\n\nJohn Bercow was quick to join those condemning the suspension of parliament as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. The speaker was not consulted in advance \u2013 no surprise, given the tension between him and ministers. They have previously accused him of ripping up the Commons rulebook to aid backbenchers trying to block Brexit. Mr Bercow cannot prevent prorogation but will almost certainly be a thorn in the government\u2019s side as MPs try every trick in the book to stop no deal.\n\nAn election\n\nSome Tories believe Mr Johnson might seek an election before 31 October to seek a mandate to leave then with or without a deal. That would give Remainers a chance to stop Brexit, or at least no deal. The Tory machine is certainly gearing up for an election. But Boris is unlikely to propose one, judging it would be better for him if an election were imposed by the Commons so he could fight on the side of \u201cthe people versus parliament\u201d.\n\nA Final Say referendum\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But there is not yet a Commons majority in favour. In any case, the move would require government legislation. It would take six months to organise, meaning an extension to the UK\u2019s EU membership, which Mr Johnson opposes.\n\nA deal\n\nMr Johnson insists he is still pursuing a revised Brexit deal and has convinced some EU leaders he wants one. The Queen\u2019s Speech will come three days before a summit at which EU leaders might offer changes to the withdrawal agreement. Boris could then rush a bill through parliament before 31 October, including a transitional period ensuring that little would change on 1 November. However, several ministers believe no deal remains more likely than a deal.", "description": "MPs trying to stop the UK crashing out of the EU on 31 October were dealt a blow by Boris Johnson\u2019s decision\u00a0to cut the number of Commons sitting days before then by holding a Queen\u2019s Speech on 14 October.
