(AP) - It\u2019s been a strange season for Atlanta United.\n\nThey\u2019ve added more two more cups to their collection.\n\nThey\u2019ve endured some rather baffling losses.\n\nAfter all that, the defending MLS Cup champions are heading into the postseason from essentially the same position as last season.\n\nAtlanta, which was runner-up in the Eastern Conference, will host the New England Revolution on Saturday in the opening round of the playoffs, a rematch of their Oct. 6 game to close out the regular season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put ourselves in a pretty decent spot, as strange as the season has maybe been,\u201d midfielder Julian Gressel said Wednesday after a training session. \u201cWe\u2019ve already won two trophies, and now we have a chance for a third.\u201d\n\nIn mid-August, United broke out the champagne after a 3-2 victory over Mexican powerhouse Club Am\u00e9rica to capture the Campeones Cup.\n\nA couple of weeks later, they were celebrating again with a 2-1 victory over Minnesota United in the U.S. Open Cup final, guaranteeing a spot in next year\u2019s CONCACAF Champions League.\n\n\u201cI felt like we were always there and pretty much at our best in those games,\u201d Gressel said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m pretty confident we\u2019ll be at our best when it really matters.\u201d\n\nBut there are reasons to be concerned. Atlanta struggled badly in some league games - especially on the road - and rarely looked like the dynamic team that won the MLS Cup in just its second year under former coach Tata Martino.\n\nWith Frank de Boer now at the helm, United got off to a sluggish start and spent much of the season juggling lineups and switching up tactics in a desperate bid to find some consistency. Atlanta never put together an unbeaten streak longer than five games - it had three such stretches a year ago - and finished with 58 points, 58 goals and a plus-15 goal differential. All were short of the 69 points, 70 goals and plus-26 differential from the 2018 season.\n\nStill, United\u2019s second-place showing in the East behind New York City FC matches last year\u2019s finish, guaranteeing the team at least one home game in the playoffs and another in the conference semifinals should it beat the Revolution.\n\nThat\u2019s a crucial edge for a franchise that has essentially broken every MLS attendance record and again averaged more than 52,000 per game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, doubling up every team in the league except Seattle and Cincinnati. In 17 home games, Atlanta lost only twice.\n\nWhile United closed out the season with a 3-1 victory over New England, the Revolution has been one of the league\u2019s hottest teams over the second half of the season.\n\nAtlanta will be further tested by the possible absence of its best defender, Miles Robinson, who is dealing with a strained left hamstring sustained during a workout with the U.S. national team last week.\n\nIf Robinson can\u2019t go, United will have to change up their lineup once again and possibly adopt a more defensive approach to Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIf I do push up, it\u2019s more so getting back a little faster than I normally would, things like that,\u201d said midfielder Darlington Nagbe, one of those who may be affected if Robinson can\u2019t go. \u201cJust feel the game out and see how it plays out.\u201d\n\nIn the regular-season finale, Ezequiel Barco got the start over Pity Martinez, a lineup that de Boer might go with again in the playoffs.\n\nBarco played only 15 league games this season because of injuries and a lengthy stint with Argentina at the FIFA U-20 World Cup, but he provided the sort of spark de Boer was looking for against New England. Martinez, who was the 2018 South American player of the year and Atlanta\u2019s major acquisition during the last offseason, has struggled to find his nice in MLS with just five goals in 32 appearances.\n\n\u201cWe have to see,\u201d de Boer said. \u201cThe only thing that concerns me is to win the playoffs.\u201d\n\nMLS switched up the playoff format this season. Instead of the top two teams from both the East and the West receiving byes and two-legged rounds to determine the winner of conference semifinals and finals, only the first-place finisher gets the opening round off and every step of the playoffs is a single-game elimination.\n\nThere is no room for error.\n\n\u201cIf you have an off day, you might be out,\u201d Gressel said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a format that favors the underdog a bit more, or gives the underdog a bit more hope.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's been a strange season for Atlanta United.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/atlanta_united_defending_the_cup_soccer_78014_c0-93-2239-1399_s1200x700.jpg?8b928a08910dff6d67c0663ec7a56b8ee7aeb45d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
