Mitt Romney (R-UT) over his secret Twitter account, saying that his chosen pseudonym of \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d sounded more like \u201csomething from French-Canadian soft-core porn.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend Romney was profiled in an Atlantic article titled \u201cThe Liberation of Mitt Romney,\u201d where he revealed that he had a secret Twitter account. Slate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg later unearthed the account under the name \u201cPierre Delecto,\u201d which Romney confirmed was his own.\n\n\u201cI know sounds more a mid-seventies erotic novella, but is actually more about Romney\u2019s role as a critic of Donald Trump,\u201d said of the article on Monday\u2019s night\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cYes, Pierre Delecto!\u201d Colbert said of Romney\u2019s Twitter account name. \u201cIt sounds like something from French-Canadian soft-core porn. This is the most embarrassing reveal since we found out Lindsey Graham\u2019s secret Twitter handle is \u2018Wolfgang Scrumptious.'\u201d\n\n\n\nColbert also noted how Romney followed a number of late-night television hosts including Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon, while his own name wasn\u2019t mentioned.\n\n\u201cIt turns out Conan is not the only late-night host he follows. He also likes Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon,\u201d he said to groans from the audience. \u201cNo, no, I get it. And I\u2019m proud to launch our new ad campaign, \u2018Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon, The Choice of Mitt Romney \u2013 Watch the late show only on CBS.'\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Axios on Sunday evening, Romney admitted to feeling embarrassed after being called a \u201clurker\u201d by interviewer Michael Allen.\n\n\u201cI have two official accounts \u2014 one is a Senate account and the other is the Mitt Romney account and those accounts are not ones I look at regularly,\u201d he explained. \u201cI do follow them, but I have an anonymous account, which is the one that I look at two or three times a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so you\u2019re a lurker?\u201d Allen responded, to which Romney said: \u201cIs that what they\u2019re called? I\u2019m embarrassed to be called a lurker. I\u2019ve been called a lot of things, but being called a lurker is a new low.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Head to the Breitbart Store to commemorate the 2012 national disgrace that was Mitt \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d Romney\u2019s failed presidential campaign with a new collection of merchandise.", "description": "CBS \"Late Show\"\u00a0host Stephen Colbert ripped Sen.
