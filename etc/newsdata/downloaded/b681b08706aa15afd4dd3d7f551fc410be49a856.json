Asa Hutchinson said during a March 17 radio interview.\n\nHutchinson officially opposes the 2010 federal health law. But, like Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Hutchinson supports the law\u2019s new federal spending to put working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on Medicaid.\n\nHutchinson echoed Kasich\u2019s faith-based Obamacare rhetoric in an interview with Doc Washburn on Newsradio 102.9 KARN, insisting his Arkansas Works plan would use Medicaid expansion funding to help the poor.\n\nWithout Medicaid expansion, Hutchinson said, \u201cwe\u2019re ending any type of coverage for that waitress in the diner that\u2019s struggling to make a living, that for the first time has some health insurance. But we\u2019d be continuing to subsidize that middle-income person who goes on the exchange to get their insurance that the government helps pay for.\u201d\n\nUnder Obamacare, Arkansans with incomes ranging from 100-400 percent of the poverty line can purchase subsidized health insurance through HealthCare.gov. Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion covers anyone with income at or below 138 percent of the poverty line.\n\n\u201cThat is fundamentally unfair,\u201d Hutchinson continued, \u201cand I think it\u2019s quite frankly unbiblical that we would forget the least of these and say we\u2019re going to continue to provide taxpayers\u2019 money to help the more wealthy or those that have more income.\u201d\n\nKasich \u2014 a fellow Republican \u2014 frequently uses the Bible to threaten Obamacare critics as he travels the country promoting Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWhen ya get to see St. Peter he\u2019s not gonna ask, \u2018Did you balance the budget?\u2019\u201d Kasich said during an October 2014 campaign stop. \u201cHe\u2019s going to say, whether he\u2019s Peter or whether he\u2019s Jacob, \u2018What\u2019d you do for the least of those?\u2019\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kasich says the Bible supports Obamacare\n\nHutchinson also told Washburn that rejecting Medicaid expansion would mean \u201csending our money to Washington, we\u2019re getting nothing for [it],\u201d a common refrain from Kasich as he pushed for Medicaid expansion in Ohio.\n\nGovernor Steve Bullock, a Democrat, borrowed a similar Kasich talking point to pressure Republican lawmakers into expanding Medicaid in Montana last year.\n\n\"Turning down your money back to MT on an ideological basis\u2026doesn't make a lot of sense to me,\"-OH Repub Gov Kasich http://t.co/czPrW919BK \u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) January 22, 2015\n\nIn Ohio, Kasich ultimately circumvented the General Assembly for his Medicaid expansion after failing to persuade legislators to support it. Hutchinson\u2019s Arkansas Works plan centers on waivers meant to make the proposal more palatable to Republican legislators.\n\nArkansas Works would replace the state\u2019s Private Option, a budget-busting Medicaid expansion program Hutchinson agreed to end this year. Any waivers for enrollee work requirements or cost-sharing would require approval from the Obama administration, which has rejected similar requests from other states.\n\nState Rep. Josh Miller, a Republican from Heber Springs, has been fighting the Private Option since before its launch in 2014. Miller thinks Hutchinson\u2019s recent comments prove his Arkansas Works waiver requests are primarily for show.\n\n\u201cYou can never negotiate a deal that works well for you when you show up with your hat in your hand,\u201d Miller told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cWhen I ran a bill to eliminate waiting lists for 3,000 Arkansans who have severe developmental disabilities, the governor came out in opposition to that,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI wish he\u2019d had his same dedication to the scriptures in regard to those 3,000 Arkansans who are truly our most vulnerable population.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the governor said smells a lot like dedication to line the pockets of big insurance companies, and it also smells a lot like bovine defecation,\u201d Miller said.\n\nCiting the bill to resolve Medicaid waiting lists for the disabled, Miller\u2019s opponent in the March 1 primary \u2014 who was endorsed and funded by Hutchinson \u2014 ran a radio ad painting Miller as an Obamacare supporter. Miller won the primary by 50 points.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cridiculous,\u201d Miller said, \u201cto call into question members of the legislature\u2019s faith who think we don\u2019t need to put our state and our nation into more of a tailspin of unmanageable debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the governor did himself any favors with the legislature,\u201d he added.\n\nTo win lawmakers\u2019 support for Arkansas Works, Hutchinson has sought to distinguish his plan from the Private Option, and the Private Option from Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nBefore Hutchinson declared rolling back Medicaid expansion \u201cunbiblical,\u201d Arkansas radio host Paul Harrell noted in February that the governor \u2014 a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 said Medicaid expansion wasn\u2019t part of Obamacare only days before conceding it was a key component of Obamacare.\n\nThe governor has a receptive audience for Arkansas Works in the State Senate, where Private Option supporters Jane English, Lance Eads, and Eddie Joe Williams won contested primaries this month with Hutchinson\u2019s help.\n\nHutchinson\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Part 16 of 16 in the series Kasich's Obamacare Roadshow\r\n\r\nCUES .09/02/2019 3:15:58AM EST.", "authors": ["Jason Hart", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/03/AR-asa-hutchinson-2016-03.jpg"}
