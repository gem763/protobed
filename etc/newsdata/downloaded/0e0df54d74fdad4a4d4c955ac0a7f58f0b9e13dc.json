A potential third-party spoiler? A Russian asset? Just sincerely pissed at the DNC?\n\nDemocratic Party insiders have some guesses, but really, they\u2019re just deeply confused about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s latest campaign moves. In a year when several lower-tier presidential candidates seem to be confoundingly staying in past their campaigns\u2019 expiration dates, Gabbard may be the one causing the most head-scratching.\n\nAnd this week was her biggest and most confusing one yet.\n\nThe Hawaii congresswoman, who\u2019s been polling anywhere between 1% and 3% in the 2020 Democratic primary, has spent the past week lashing out at Hillary Clinton and the DNC, after Clinton said on a podcast that Gabbard was \u201cthe favorite of the Russians.\u201d Gabbard then appeared on Fox News with Sean Hannity to cast suspicion about how her House colleagues are conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTo top off the week, she announced she\u2019s betting the farm on her presidential candidacy. In a slickly produced video, she said she\u2019d forego another run for her congressional seat: \u201cI believe I can best serve the people of Hawai\u02bbi and our country as President and Commander-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nREAD: How Tulsi Gabbard hacked the right-wing media feedback loop\n\nZac Petkanas, a former Hillary for America campaign aide, fiercely criticized Gabbard for excoriating Clinton in a widely-circulated campaign web video, and later on Hannity\u2019s show. He said he believes she is \u201ceither wittingly or unwittingly\u201d carrying water for Russians with her non-adversarial stance toward Syrian strongman Bashar Assad and hesitancy to support impeaching President Donald Trump..\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning, Tulsi has positioned herself to try to be a spoiler in every election that she\u2019s participated in this cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the primary campaign, she\u2019s existed solely to throw outrageous attacks, to undermine Democratic candidates in the field, and now, to no one\u2019s surprise, she\u2019s talking about working to reelect Donald Trump by being the Jill Stein of the 2020 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see this as being anything other than her intent and goal from Day One,\u201d he added.\n\nTo be clear, Gabbard has said she will not run as a third-party candidate \u2014 so staff at the DNC is taking her at her word and proceeding as such. Gabbard\u2019s campaign declined a request for comment.\n\nSpeaking Thursday on the podcast \u201cAngry Americans with Paul Rieckhoff,\u201d a veterans advocate, Gabbard reiterated that she would take her campaign all the way to the Democratic convention \u2014 and that she wouldn't launch a third-party bid.\n\n\u2018My goal is to actually strengthen the party\u2019\n\n\"I will not. No,\" she said, calling Clinton's claims baseless. \"My interest and goal is not to just leave the party and run separately, as I've said. My goal is to actually strengthen the party.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly novel for a candidate to use the DNC as a foil. Inside the DNC, Gabbard\u2019s machinations are being viewed as little more than that: trying to bolster her flagging campaign by pitching it as her against the system.\n\nIf that were the case, it could explain some of the unconventional campaign moves. As of Friday, Gabbard is on the outside looking in for the November debate. She has reached the threshold for at least 165,000 individual campaign donors but has yet to meet the 3% cutoff in enough polls. She has one qualifying poll with that result, but she needs four.\n\nYet even as the DNC projects a shoulder shrug, there\u2019s a feeling that they\u2019d rather not engage with Gabbard, lest they poke the bear or give her line of attack any more attention. That does indicate some level of unease with a candidate who could be a wild card.\n\nEd Rendell, the former DNC chairman and Pennsylvania governor who is supporting the Biden campaign, predicted that if Gabbard\u2019s goal is to be a disruptive force at the convention, she is likely to fall flat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she can be a factor. She\u2019s not going to have many votes and our people have learned. I really believe that,\u201d he said, pointing out that a contingent of Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 supporters only managed to disrupt the Democratic National Convention because he had so many delegates there in the first place due to his strong primary campaign. Gabbard is currently polling in the low single digits and on pace to win zero delegates.\n\nA third-party run worried him more, but Rendell said he thought liberals were less likely to bolt given what happened last election.\n\n\u201cI hope that our folks have learned their lesson from 2016. Jill Stein and the Green Party ticket got more votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania than Hillary lost by,\u201d he said.\u201d I think our people are not going to make that mistake again.\u201d\n\nDespite Gabbard\u2019s assertions she won\u2019t run as a third-party candidates, campaign prognosticators have begun asking whether a Gabbard third-party run would even hurt Democrats, rather than hurt President Donald Trump by drawing disaffected Republicans to a campaign of someone promising a better way.\n\nThere might be more evidence to back that up, said ballot-access expert Richard Winger. He said research and campaign postmortems have shown that a third-party candidate is not a factor in siphoning away votes from a similar major-party candidate.\n\n\u201cThese people who throw around \u2018spoiler\u2019 are ignorant of the research that contradicts their thinking,\u201d Winger said. \u201cIt just drives me crazy. There\u2019s all this sophisticated psychological research and historical data that gets ignored and people just assume that a Green [Party candidate] or somebody like that hurts Democrats automatically.\u201d\n\nHe also added that there would be significant institutional hurdles to get Gabbard on state ballots, namely state-level qualifications and sore-loser laws, which vary from state to state but are fairly strict in some key states.\n\nUnless Gabbard ran as a candidate of an established third party, like the Green Party or the Libertarian Party, she\u2019d have a hard time getting on the ballot anywhere. Her ideology doesn\u2019t exactly square with either of those parties, though, and their conventions are held in May and July respectively \u2014 before the DNC\u2019s July convention \u2014 meaning they would have named their nominees before Gabbard would even have a chance to be spurned by the DNC one final time.\n\nDavid Uberti contributed reporting.\n\nCover: Democratic presidential candidate and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard greets guests at the Polk County Democrats' Steak Fry on September 21, 2019 in Des Moines, Iowa.
