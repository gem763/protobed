The sell-side were earlier talking up illion's infrastructure-like properties in an effort to capture the attention of a cashed-up core-plus fund.\n\nArcher Capital is understood to be asking for binding bids in late November, which means a reasonably tight auction timetable that should play into the private equity firms' hands.\n\nillion is expected to be worth about $1.5 billion, based on $89 million forecast EBITDA in the 2020 financial year and a high-teens multiple. Interested parties were also told to expect $226 million revenue this fiscal year.\n\nInvestment bankers will be circling the shortlisted parties in coming weeks, seeking to lock down buy-side mandates. The private equity firms will no doubt be after some big promises on debt pricing and terms. Similar businesses offshore are geared at about seven-times EBITDA.\n\nShould the auction pan out as expected, illion may well be the next in a growing number of secondary Australian private equity deals. Only last week we saw Affinity Equity Partners sign TEG's $1.3 billion sale to Silver Lake.", "description": "The auction for data registries and analytics\u00a0business illion is the hottest private equity shootout this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4099%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d9d32464ddc0fc17de1a09ea27547053104f3ce9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
