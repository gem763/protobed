(Doug Kapustin for The Washington Post)\n\nDown in the basement of a dining hall at the University of Maryland, closer to academic buildings than any athletic facility, Jeffrey Russo readies for his quick, choreographed routine. A cavernous bowl filled with caramelized graham cracker bits sits on a stainless steel table next to a bucket of caramel; soon, he will distribute those ingredients into a few cups to prepare for the main act.\n\nRusso, the executive pastry chef for university\u2019s dining services, describes making ice cream as an art and a science. He can rattle on about the importance of each step, from the methods and machines to the precise storage temperatures. But Russo calls the brunt of the labor \u201cvery, very low tech.\u201d He and an assistant shake the cups of graham cracker bits and caramel into a three-gallon tub as the machine dispenses ice cream. They manually rotate the bucket as it fills quickly with the Maryland Dairy\u2019s newest flavor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a dance than anything else,\u201d said Russo, who wore a white apron embroidered with his name and a Maryland logo.\n\nThe process takes just a few minutes and then it\u2019s off to the storage freezer for these buckets labeled: FOOTBALL.\n\nWhile the morning routine of making ice cream begins in a small, windowless room, its origin story has roots in the football facility, where Coach Michael Locksley brainstormed his ideal ice cream flavor this summer and eventually chose the final product after a taste test with five options.\n\n[Maryland QB Josh Jackson and RB Anthony McFarland Jr. expected back from injuries]\n\nThe dairy, which is housed inside the student union and uses milk from local cows, sells ice cream of typical flavors, others that are seasonal or more obscure, and six dedicated to coaches on campus. The coach-inspired variations began in 2004 with Ralph Friedgen\u2019s vanilla that included fudge, brownies and chocolate-covered cashews. More than a decade later, the sweet honor spread to Maryland\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball coaches. In recent years, the dairy added flavors dedicated to the leaders of three of the most successful programs on campus: men\u2019s soccer, field hockey and women\u2019s lacrosse.\n\nCoach Sport Flavor Debut Mark Turgeon Men\u2019s basketball Turge Turtle Crunch Summer 2015 Brenda Frese Women\u2019s basketball Brenda\u2019s Peanut Butter Frese Summer 2015 Sasho Cirovski Men\u2019s soccer Sasho\u2019s Crew Crunch Fall 2017 Missy Meharg Field hockey Terpresso Fall 2018 Cathy Reese Women\u2019s lacrosse Cathy Reese\u2019s Victory Swirl Spring 2019 Michael Locksley Football Pop, #LOCKedIn, Drop It Summer 2019\n\nApart from football coaches like Locksley, who received his flavor before his team played a game, the rest earn their ice cream through a meritocracy of sorts. There\u2019s no precise rule for who gets one, but it\u2019s obvious that success of the program plays a role. Only some of the teams\u2019 venues can sell ice cream at games, which also becomes a factor, according to Lori Dominick, the general manager for the dining services portion of the student union\u2019s food court.\n\nStaff members from either dining services or the athletic department begin the conversation about creating an ice cream flavor. Once the dairy decides to move forward with a new variation, Russo receives the details about the coach\u2019s preferred sweets, flavors or other mix-ins. Frequently, he said, those correspond with their childhood favorites. Locksley much prefers vanilla to chocolate, while Mark Turgeon\u2019s finished product resembles the Jamoca Almond Fudge flavor at Baskin-Robbins.\n\n\u201cBut the great thing about it is everyone has a lot of interest in it,\u201d Russo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really just, \u2018Make me something.\u2019 They all want to be a part of it because it\u2019s their namesake.\u201d\n\nNo coaches have requested a flavor combination that Russo has worried about being able to pull off. (\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for ice cream not to work, when you really consider it,\u201d he said.) While developing the options, Russo first considers quality: What will create the best taste? What will please the coach and consumers? Russo also ensures that the ingredients will always be available. For instance, if a supplier stopped making the caramelized graham cracker bits needed for Locksley\u2019s flavor, Russo could make those himself until he finds a new purchasing option.\n\n\n\nLocksley's flavor features vanilla ice cream, caramelized graham cracker bits and a salted caramel swirl. (Doug Kapustin for The Washington Post)\n\nFor his taste test, Locksley enlisted help a handful of staffers, including the director of player development, a team nutritionist and his executive assistant. Locksley said the decision was essentially unanimous in favor of the version sold today. Women\u2019s lacrosse coach Cathy Reese let all her players take part in the tasting before the flavor debuted last spring. Naturally, her creation includes Reese\u2019s Pieces and Reese\u2019s Cups. Reese joked the taste tests were the best part, adding how the ice cream that honors women\u2019s lacrosse is \u201csomething that we can do that\u2019s fun that can embrace the whole community.\u201d\n\nThe tradition is still young, so it hasn\u2019t faced many crossroads despite the turnover rate in the results-oriented business of coaching. Plus, most of the coaches who have an ice cream named for them are fixtures at Maryland.\n\nBut when the university last year placed football coach DJ Durkin on administrative leave in the wake of the death of offensive lineman Jordan McNair and troubling reports about cultural issues within the program, dining services had its own scrambling to do. Dominick said her department quickly realized, \u201cOh, this is happening, let\u2019s take care of anything on our end that we can.\u201d So the dairy changed the name of Terpin\u2019 Durkin Crunch to Pretzel Logic, which is no longer sold.\n\nIf a coach with a popular ice cream flavor leaves the school, Dominick said the dairy \u201cwould probably just rename it and keep carrying it, see if people kept ordering it.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s basketball coach Brenda Frese\u2019s flavor, which is packed with brownie bites and peanut butter cups, is the most popular of the coach creations. Turgeon\u2019s vanilla, which includes crushed almonds and a chocolate swirl, is not far behind. Frese shows visiting recruits the dairy \u2014 \u201ckind of a fun little selling point,\u201d she said \u2014 and her ice cream appears at events for women\u2019s basketball donors, too. The new Locksley-inspired variation is one of Russo\u2019s personal favorites.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cYou should try it.\u201d\n\nCoaches usually take part in the flavor\u2019s unveiling; Locksley scooped his concoction for students at an event just before the football season began. Sometimes love for a team or appreciation of a coach might prompt someone to try a flavor. But when they stop by the dairy for more, that\u2019s less so for the name on the label than for the creation itself.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland basketball will begin the season ranked No. 7\n\nJohn Feinstein: Iowa State is finally a winner under Matt Campbell.
