Mandatory Credit: Dennis Wierzbicki-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nESPN reported the Cubs will make the official announcement Thursday.\n\nRoss, 42, has no managerial experience at any level. A catcher, he played with seven teams over 15 seasons, including the Cubs. He was part of Chicago\u2019s 2016 World Series-winning team, and he also won a title with the Boston Red Sox in 2013.\n\nRoss retired following the 2016 season and served as a Cubs special assistant to baseball operations and an ESPN analyst.\n\n\u2014Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels and Christian Yelich of the Milwaukee Brewers were selected as winners of the Hank Aaron Award, which goes to the top offensive player in each league.\n\nYelich won the National League honor for the second straight season and is in position to repeat as NL MVP. Trout won the American League honor for the second time \u2014 2014 was the first \u2014 and is one of the favorites to win his third AL MVP award.\n\nTrout hit a career-best 45 homers, led the majors with a .438 on-base percentage and led the AL with a .645 slugging percentage. He batted .291 with 104 RBIs in 134 games. Yelich led the NL with a .329 batting average and .429 on-base percentage and led the majors with a .671 slugging percentage. He set career-highs of 44 homers and 30 steals and also drove in 97 runs in 130 games.\n\n\u2014The Pittsburgh Pirates parted ways with team president Frank Coonelly and will name his successor early next week, the club announced.\n\nThe decision to move on from Connelly comes a few weeks after the Pirates fired manager Clint Hurdle after nine seasons. The team also announced earlier this month that pitching coach Ray Searage and bench coach Tom Prince would not return next season.\n\nCoonelly, 59, has been with the Pirates since 2007. Prior to joining Pittsburgh, he served as the senior vice president and general counsel of labor in the MLB commissioner\u2019s office.\n\n\u2014George Springer\u2019s failure to immediately run out a long drive in Game 1 of the World Series didn\u2019t sit well with AJ Hinch, though the Houston Astros manager is backing his team\u2019s potent slugger.\n\nSpringer ended up with a double on an eighth-inning play on Tuesday but may have able to reach third if he had run from the outset. The lack of hustle was magnified when Jose Altuve followed with a fly to right \u2014 a play in which Springer could have tried to score from third \u2014 with the Astros trailing by one in the eventual 5-4 defeat.\n\nHinch and Springer discussed the play twice. Springer called the manager late Tuesday night when he was surprised at the public backlash and the two met face-to-face on Wednesday. Hinch said prior to Wednesday\u2019s Game 2 that it was \u201ca mediocre baserunning play\u201d as opposed to \u201can egregious showmanship kind of pimp job, as they call it.\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Chicago Cubs will name David Ross as manager, succeeding Joe Maddon, according to multiple reports Wednesday morning.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444318306&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N01S-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
