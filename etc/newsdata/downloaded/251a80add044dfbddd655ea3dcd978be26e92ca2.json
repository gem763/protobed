Most occurred along Highway 60 between Huntsville and Barry's Bay, Nolan said.\n\n\"[It's] not only those looking at the leaves, but people that are half pulling off the road, maybe doing a U-turn after they've pulled off the road and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 just stumbling into traffic to take that picture,\" he said.\n\nHeavy visitor volumes led to the temporary closure of one Gatineau Park entrance on both Saturday and Sunday. (Kim Valli\u00e8re/Radio-Canada)\n\nAlgonquin Park, Gatineau Park both overrun\n\nPart of the issue is the sheer number of vehicles in the area, often driven by people unfamiliar with the sometimes narrow and winding roads.\n\nThere were about 4,000 cars and 23 coach buses in Algonquin Park Sunday, an official said.\n\nCloser to Ottawa, the National Capital Commission had to temporarily close one of the Gatineau Park entrances on both Saturday and Sunday to manage the number of visitors.\n\nAlong with asking drivers to concentrate on the road and not the trees, Nolan suggested stopping in small towns or going to parks to get photos rather than stopping on the side of the road, no matter how bright or vibrant the colours are.\n\nTraffic is backed up on Highway 60 in Algonquin Park on Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019. Park officials say about 4,000 vehicles entered the park that day. (County of Renfrew Paramedic Service)\n\nHe also urged leaf-seekers to plan ahead and pick stops where it's safe to park and get out.\n\n\"Look on your map, figure out where your best shots will be,\" Nolan said.\n\n\"And recognize that with increased cottage traffic, Thanksgiving traffic and people out enjoying the leaves, that that's going to take a bit of planning ahead.\"", "description": "A county west of Ottawa is asking leaf-lovers\u00a0to use\u00a0common sense and focus on the road when they're hunting for fall colours, after three serious weekend crashes.", "authors": ["Laura Glowacki Is A Reporter Based In Ottawa", "Winnipeg.
