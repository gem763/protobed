And a timely book given the growing interest in international boundary issues following Brexit.\n\nHere we present a selection of the tome\u2019s astonishing revelations \u2013 and the maps that illustrate them - including the German town that\u2019s not in the EU, the French-Swiss border that passes through the double bed in a honeymoon suite and Spain\u2019s controversial territories in Morocco across the water from Gibraltar \u2013 one of which has the world\u2019s shortest land border.\n\nWe also bring tidings of the town split in two by the U.S\u2013Canada border and the capital city that\u2019s a ghost town.\n\nYou might also be interested to hear about the slice of Kentucky that may one day merge with Missouri.\n\nScroll down for a fascinating odyssey through a world of enclaves, counter-enclaves and loopy territorial loopholes.\n\nMedurjecje \u2013 it\u2019s in Serbia, but it belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe tiny village of Medurjecje sits firmly in Serbian territory, but it actually belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nThe tiny village of Medurjecje has 270 inhabitants, covers an area of just under 400 hectares and is in Serbia.\n\nExcept that in one important regard, it isn\u2019t.\n\nWhile it sits firmly in Serbian territory, it actually belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is just over half a mile away.\n\nMr Nikolic explains: \u2018According to a popular local story, during the time of the Ottoman Empire, a Bosnian local ruler gifted one of his wives 400 hectares of land and woods in the vicinity of Priboj in Serbia. When demarcation was established between Austria-Hungary and Turkey, this land was annexed to Bosnia, occupied at that time by the Habsburg Empire. Ever since then, this land has been classed as part of the municipality of Rudo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the meantime, the village of Medurjecje was built there.\u2019\n\nIn terms of practicalities, the upshot of all this is that because Serbia provides the infrastructure \u2013 roads and power supply and so forth - utility bills are paid to Priboj in Serbia, but taxes to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nChildren from the village, Mr Nikolic says, attend classes in the enclave\u2019s primary school along with Serbian children \u2013 and follow a Serbian curriculum.\n\nHe adds that Serbia proposes an exchange of territories with Bosnia and Herzegovina to \u2018correct\u2019 the border, while Bosnia believes that establishing a corridor between Rudo and Medurjecje would be a better solution.\n\nLlivia \u2013 it\u2019s in France, but it belongs to Spain\n\nLlivia is in France, just east of Andorra. But it belongs to Spain - thanks to a quirk of a 17th-century treaty\n\nThe inhabitants of Llivia \u2013 there are around 1,500 of them \u2013 \u2018often regard their town as the \u201cbirthplace\u201d of Catalonia'\n\nLlivia is in France, just east of Andorra and just over half a mile from the French-Spanish border.\n\nBut it belongs to Spain.\n\nWhy? Mr Nikolic explains: \u2018A significant factor was the granting of town status upon Llivia as far back as the early Middle Ages. It had been the ancient capital of one of the Catalan countries, Cerdanya. When a border agreement between Spain and France was drawn up in the 17th century, Spain was obliged to hand over all of the villages of Northern Cerdanya to France. However, as Llivia had the status of a town, Spain retained this detached piece of land.\u2019\n\nHe adds that the inhabitants \u2013 there are around 1,500 of them \u2013 \u2018often regard their town as the \u201cbirthplace\u201d of Catalonia, because their medieval ruler, Count Sunifred, ruling from Llivia itself, laid the foundations of the present-day Catalan identity\u2019.\n\nBusingen am Hochrhein \u2013 the German town that is not part of the EU\n\nThe town of Busingen am Hochrhein is German but it is part of the Swiss customs territory\n\nThe local football club in Busingen am Hochrhein, pictured, is the only German club competing in the Swiss league\n\nThe town of Busingen am Hochrhein is German.\n\nBut that\u2019s about as straightforward as things get with regard to its territorial status.\n\nIt\u2019s separated from Germany by Swiss territory that encircles it and which at its narrowest point is just 700 metres (2,300ft) wide.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not in the EU.\n\nBut it is part of the Swiss customs territory and the Swiss franc is the most commonly used currency, although it's possible to make payments in euros.\n\n\u2018Since the First World War, a few referendums were held in B\u00fcsingen in which close to 100 per cent of the population expressed their desire to join Switzerland,\u2019 says Mr Nikolic. \u2018Each time, Switzerland rejected this request as it lacked an appropriate territory to offer Germany in exchange.\u2019\n\nThe local football club, he adds, is the only German club competing in the Swiss league.\n\nBaarle \u2013 where the \u2018citizenship\u2019 of a house is determined by the position of its front door\n\nBaarle consists of two parts - the Dutch Baarle-Nassau and the Belgian Baarle-Hertog\n\nIn Baarle, where the boundary cuts through a house, its citizenship is determined based on whose territory the front door is facing\n\nBaarle is in the south of the Netherlands, close to the border with Belgium, but has a split personality \u2013 it\u2019s partly Belgian, partly Dutch.\n\nMr Nikolic says: \u2018The town consists of two parts: the Dutch Baarle-Nassau and the Belgian Baarle-Hertog. The Belgian part includes more than 20 enclaves within the Dutch section of the town, while inside these Belgian enclaves there are approximately 10 Dutch counter-enclaves. This means that the border intersects some of the streets several times, while some houses are partly in Belgium and partly in the Netherlands.\n\n\u2018In cases where the boundary cuts through a house, its \u201ccitizenship\u201d is determined on the basis of whose territory the front door is facing. Throughout history \u2013 and accompanying numerous changes of tax rates in the Netherlands and Belgium \u2013 relocating the front door was not unusual, in order that the owner could pay less tax.\u2019\n\nSpain\u2019s \u2018mini Gibraltars\u2019 and the shortest land border in the world\n\nSpain has its own tiny \u2018Gibraltars\u2019, just across the water from the UK's Gibraltar on Morocco\u2019s Mediterranean coast \u2013 and Morocco is not happy about it in the slightest\n\nSpain's rock fort of Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera, pictured, is where you'll find the world\u2019s shortest land border - it's just 278 feet (85 metres)\n\nThe Spanish really don\u2019t like the fact that the rocky peninsula of Gibraltar belongs to the UK.\n\nBut Spain has its own tiny \u2018Gibraltars\u2019, just across the water on Morocco\u2019s Mediterranean coast \u2013 and Morocco is not happy about it in the slightest.\n\nThey are essentially leftovers from Spain\u2019s war with Muslim forces in the 15th and 16th centuries, when Spanish generals took strategic pieces of land as their enemies retreated into Africa, partly for monitoring purposes.\n\nMr Nikolic explains that they are a \u2018few small islands and peninsulas\u2019 known as Spanish sovereign territories (plazas de soberan\u00eda).\n\nHe continues: \u2018Their collective name refers to the fact that they have been a part of Spain ever since the formation of the modern Spanish state in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\n\u2018The sovereign territories are fully Spanish and thus part of the European Union and the Schengen Area.\n\n\u2018One of those Sovereign territories, the rock fort of Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera (pe\u00f1\u00f3n means rock), was a small, natural, rocky island until the 1930s, when a storm deposited large quantities of sand between the island and mainland, turning it into a specific type of peninsula, known as a tombolo or \u201ctied island\u201d. The world\u2019s shortest land border is at that very point, only 85 metres long (278 feet).\u2019\n\nHe adds: \u2018The Moroccan authorities consider all of these territories to be the remainders of Spanish colonial occupation and that they should be returned immediately.\u2019\n\nOddities on the Canadian-U.S border \u2013 including the town that it splits in two\n\nThe border between the U.S and Canada is the world\u2019s longest and it\u2019s mostly a straight line. But there are a few quirks. One is the Northwest Angle\n\nThe U.S-Canadian border at one point runs down the middle of a settlement's main street, with Canadian Stanstead on one side and American Beebe Plain on the other (pictured)\n\nThe border between the U.S and Canada is the world\u2019s longest (5,524 miles) \u2013 and it\u2019s mostly a straight line.\n\nBut there are a few quirks.\n\nOne is the Northwest Angle, the only territory of the United States, except Alaska, that lies to the north of the 49th parallel, Mr Nikolic points out.\n\nHe reveals that the border crossing between \u2018the Angle\u2019, as it\u2019s known, and Canada is \u2018unusual\u2019.\n\nHe says: \u2018When someone crosses the border and enters the Angle from Canada, they are required to call U.S customs officials by videophone from a small booth and vice versa.\u2019\n\nAnother notable oddity is to the east, where the border runs down the centre of a main street, with Canadian Stanstead on one side and American Beebe Plain on the other.\n\nA library and opera house was built right on the border to bring the two countries together.\n\nMr Nikolic says: \u2018Since almost all of the books and the stage are located on the Canadian side, it is often said that this is the only American library without books and the only American opera without a stage. The border is marked with a black line across the inside of the building.\u2019\n\nDiomede Islands \u2013 separated by 2.5 miles of water, but a day apart\n\nThe Diomede Islands archipelago in the Bering Strait seemingly defies time and space\n\nOn a clear day you can stand on Little Diomede (above on the left) and see the next day on the neighbouring island\n\nThe Diomede Islands archipelago in the Bering Strait seemingly defies time and space.\n\nBig Diomede belongs to Russia and Little Diomede belongs to Alaska.\n\nBut only 2.5 miles of water separate them.\n\nThat\u2019s remarkable enough, but what adds to the intrigue is the fact that the International Date Line runs between them.\n\nSo, as Mr Nikolic reveals, \u2018on a clear day, from Little Diomede (also known as Yesterday Island), it\u2019s possible to see the next day on neighbouring Big Diomede (also known as Tomorrow Island)\u2019.\n\nPassport Island \u2013 the island created to connect two countries\n\nPassport Island sits in the middle of the 15-mile-long King Fahd Causeway\n\nThe 1.5-mile-long artificial island houses border stations for both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain\n\nDid you know that there\u2019s a land border between the island of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia?\n\nYou do now. It\u2019s called Passport Island and sits in the middle of the 15-mile-long King Fahd Causeway, which connects the two countries.\n\nThe 1.5-mile-long artificial island houses border stations for both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, says Mr Nikolic, along with the buildings of the Causeway Authority, two mosques, the coast guard towers of both kingdoms and two restaurants.\n\nMr Nikolic adds: \u2018The idea of linking Saudi Arabia and its little neighbouring island of Bahrain was born in the mid-1950s and construction of the bridge took from 1981 to 1986. The island was made in the shape of the figure \u201c8\u201d, where one extension belongs to Saudi Arabia, and the other belongs to Bahrain.\u2019\n\nThe Kentucky Bend \u2013 a peninsula that may one day become an island and join a different state\n\nThis peninsula may one day become cut off and turned into an island\n\nThe Kentucky Bend peninsula exists as a result of the meanders of the Mississippi River\n\nThe most southeasterly point of Kentucky is the Kentucky Bend peninsula \u2013 which is home to about 20 people.\n\nBut their peninsula may one day become cut off and turned into an island.\n\nMr Nikolic says: \u2018The Bend was formed as the result of great meanders of the Mississippi River. The only land connection of the forty-five-square-kilometre [17 square miles] peninsula is to the south, where it borders Tennessee. It is quite likely that the Mississippi River will fairly soon break through this connection with Tennessee, turning Kentucky Bend into an island, after which it will gradually connect with its northern neighbour, the state of Missouri.\u2019\n\nThe land border between Australia and Tasmania\n\nA tiny rock called Boundary Islet forms a land border between the state of Victoria in Australia and the island of Tasmania\n\nMr Nikolic describes Boundary Islet as a \u2018bare rock, whipped mercilessly by wind and waves in Bass Strait\u2019\n\nYes, you read that right. The land border.\n\nIt\u2019s a little known fact that a tiny rock called Boundary Islet forms a land border between the state of Victoria in Australia and the island of Tasmania.\n\nMr Nikolic describes it as a \u2018bare rock, whipped mercilessly by wind and waves in Bass Strait\u2019, which separates the two countries.\n\nHe continues: \u2018When the sea border between Tasmania and Victoria was defined, it was decided that the line would be drawn along the latitude of 39\u00b0 12'. It was only later that it was established that Boundary Islet did not lie further north, as was believed until then, but that it was situated exactly at that latitude, and thus it was given that name and the shortest boundary between the Australian states, only 85 metres (278ft) long.\u2019\n\nThe hotel with a border running through the double bed in its honeymoon suite\n\nThe border divides La Cure's streets and even some buildings, as this map shows\n\nLa Cure is on the border of France and Switzerland, about 18 miles north of Geneva. And the border situation attracts plenty of tourists, not least because in Hotel Arbez, the border bisects the honeymoon suite (pictured)\n\nLa Cure is a small village on the border of France and Switzerland, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of Geneva, with part of the village lying in Switzerland, and part in France.\n\nThe border divides the village, streets, and even some buildings, explains Mr Nikolic, with the most famous being Hotel Arbez.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the border, he reveals, even passes through the honeymoon suite, dividing the double bed.\n\nThe capital city that\u2019s a ghost town\n\nA huge volcanic eruption devastated swathes of Montserrat, including its capital, Plymouth\n\nPlymouth, pictured, is still technically the capital, even though it has been abandoned since 1995\n\nA huge volcanic eruption destroyed the southern half of the Caribbean island of Montserrat in 1995, including the capital, Plymouth.\n\nA new capital for this British Overseas Territory is being built in Little Bay, explains Mr Nikolic, and the temporary headquarters of the local government is in the town of Brades.\n\nHowever, despite being deserted, Plymouth is technically still the capital, \u2018making it the only ghost town that is officially the capital of a country or territory\u2019.", "description": "New book The Atlas of Unusual Borders, by Zoran Nikolic, is a truly eye-opening compendium of 'intriguing boundaries, territories and geographical curiosities'.
