This was an act of political theater\u2014the bill would not have changed very much\u2014but to everyone\u2019s surprise, Lieberman held out until Netanyahu\u2019s mandate to form a government expired. Legally, the president of Israel would then have had to task another member of Knesset with forming a government, essentially barring Netanyahu from the role. To prevent this, Netanyahu pushed the Knesset to dissolve itself and call for a second national election in less than six months.\n\nWith 98 percent of the votes counted in these September results (final results may differ marginally from these, but not in their overall significance), the opposition Blue and White, headed by Gantz, leads at 33 seats, with Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party trailing slightly, at 31 seats. Third is the Joint List, an amalgam of four parties representing mostly Arab citizens of Israel, with 13. The leading ultra-Orthodox parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, came in at nine and eight, respectively. Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beitenu has eight. The right-wing Yamina gained seven. Labor\u2014the old party of David Ben-Gurion and later Yitzhak Rabin\u2014received a paltry six. And the Democratic Union, composed of the left-wing Meretz, former prime minister Ehud Barak, and former Labor parliamentarian Stav Shaffir, rounds out the Knesset with five. To the credit of Israeli voters, Otzma Yehudit, an extreme right-wing party and successor to Meir Kahana\u2019s racist Kach, failed to pass the minimum threshold of 3.25 percent of the vote.\n\nFor an inconclusive mess, the election results actually appear quite neatly arranged. The anti-Netanyahu and the pro-Netanyahu camps are near even, with 57 to the center-left and 55 to the right-religious bloc. And Lieberman is at the pivot, precisely where he hoped to be.\n\nThe math seems clear then: No one has the majority necessary to form a governing coalition. Netanyahu will have the backing of the full 55 (or so) seats of the right wing, but unless he can entice Lieberman to re-join him or someone from the opposition to defect\u2014a possibility, for the right price, but one which Lieberman and others discount\u2014he will fall short of the magic number of 61.\n\nShould Gantz receive a mandate from Israel\u2019s president to try to form a coalition, he would not be able to form one with the Joint List (they have ruled each other out for now). Nor would he be able to bring both Lieberman and the Democratic Union into the same government. Nor would the ultra-Orthodox parties\u2014which sometimes join the center-left\u2014likely join without major concessions from Lieberman and Gantz\u2019s own partner, the secularist Yair Lapid. Never say never, but at present his path appears blocked.", "description": "The results yielded no clear path to a governing coalition, but represented a rejection of two dangerous ideas.", "authors": ["Natan Sachs", "Director Of The Center For Middle East Policy At The Brookings Institution"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX73HS2/facebook.jpg?1568900430", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
