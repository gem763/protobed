REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nThe long-drawn U.S.-China trade war has impacted chipmakers already reeling under a saturated smartphone market, especially after the Trump administration blocked access to Huawei HWT.UL, the world\u2019s largest telecoms equipment maker and Micron\u2019s single largest customer.\n\nWhile Micron has resumed some chip shipments to Huawei, the company said its sales to the Chinese smartphone maker could worsen in the coming quarters if the restrictions continue and if it fails to get licenses.\n\n\u201cWe have applied for licenses with the U.S. Department of Commerce that would allow us to ship additional products, but there have been no decisions on those licenses to date,\u201d the company said on Thursday.\n\nMicron said it expects adjusted profit in the range of 35 cents to 49 cents per share in the first quarter, below the analysts\u2019 average estimate of 48 cents.\n\nThe disappointing forecast came despite a rise in demand from China-based customers in recent months, which Micron said could be due to some of them building higher levels of inventory in the face of increased trade tensions.\n\n\u201cThat inventory build by customers is nowhere close to the kind of inventory build that occurred in the second half of last year \u2026 that impacted the demand to producers in the first half of 2019,\u201d Micron Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra told Reuters.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s tepid forecast weighed on other semiconductor stocks. Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O), Intel (INTC.O), Xilinx (XLNX.O), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) were down 0.3% to 1.3% in extended trading.\n\nHopes of a revival in global chip demand have lifted Micron\u2019s stock close to 50% so far in 2019, outpacing a 38% rise in broader Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX in the same period.\n\nNet income attributable to the company fell to $561 million, or 49 cents per share, in the quarter ended Aug. 29, from $4.33 billion, or $3.56 per share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue fell 42.3% to $4.87 billion, but beat analysts\u2019 average estimate of $4.57 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned 56 cents per share, above analysts\u2019 expectations of 49 cents.", "description": "Micron Technology Inc forecast first-quarter profit below Wall Street targets, saying it was \"mindful\" of economic and trade uncertainty even though there were signs of an uptick in memory chip demand, sending its shares down nearly 6.5%.", "authors": ["Neha Malara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434316247&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P24J", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
