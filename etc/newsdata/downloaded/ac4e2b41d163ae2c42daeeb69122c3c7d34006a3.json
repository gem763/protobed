Amid questioning over whether Arcuri gained government funding due to a closeness to the Prime Minister, Boris has remained tight lipped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Maureen is just as cagey when it comes to soap spoilers!\n\nShe told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I can\u2019t say anything, I know that\u2019s what you\u2019d like but it\u2019s a bit like asking Boris is he was intimate with the American woman!\u2019\n\nHowever, she was persuaded to part with one small morsel as she hinted that there were confrontational scenes ahead thanks to sinister new nanny Jade, who appears to have it in for Fiz.\n\nMaureen said: \u2018Things get very tight with the nanny and combatative with Fiz and Tyrone so we\u2019re playing that at the moment \u2013 I call it Confrontation Street.\u2019\n\nBut while Maureen is having a blast at Coronation Street, there is one thing that she has to suspend logic for \u2013 the sleeping arrangements chez Dobbs.\n\nShe smiled: \u2018I don\u2019t know where we all sleep \u2013 we must be sleeping top to tail! And the dog is big! It\u2019s like a Tardis that house \u2013 you don\u2019t question these things too quickly. Evelyn is established now in the Street and even people who don\u2019t like her begrudgingly respect that she can tell them they\u2019re not very nice to their face!\n\n\u2018I am really happy that the viewers picked me for their award \u2013 it really should be best latecomer after doing this for 52 years! But I think I am showing that this old dog has a few new tricks. I love being part of the company, I feel very loved in Manchester and it feels very organic to be here with my husband having written 250 episodes and myself having watched episode one.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "She's a tough nut to crack!", "authors": ["Cydney Yeates", "Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI88881996-a3b2-e1570804859112_1570805416.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
