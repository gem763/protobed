But when the 10-year deal was finally struck in 2017, it wasn't nearly as generous as the premiers had hoped: it capped increases to the Canada Health Transfer at three per cent per year, down from six per cent under the old agreement.\n\nOttawa did sweeten the pot with $11 billion in funding over 10 years for improved home and palliative care, and mental health and addiction services. The Liberals have been talking about that a lot during this campaign, along with changes to prescription drug pricing that they say will save Canadians $13 billion over the coming decade.\n\nThe Canada Health Transfer in fiscal year 2018-19 was $38.6 billion, more than half of the total $75.4 billion that flowed from Ottawa to the provinces and territories.\n\nBut that remains a fraction \u2014 just 15 per cent \u2014 of overall public and private health care spending in Canada, which totalled $253.5 billion in 2018, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nPer capita health care spending has been increasing since 2014, up an average of 1.7 per cent per year, after declining by an average of 0.2 per cent a year between 2010 and 2014. In 2018, it worked out to $ 6,839 per person, or 11.3 per cent of Canada's Gross Domestic Product. That's still below the peak health care spending ratio of 11.6 per cent of GDP in 2010.\n\nThe Liberals can claim partial credit for that uptick, but if they're really intent on filling the gaps in the system, it's going to take a lot more money than they have budgeted and promised thus far.\n\nTake Trudeau's vow to implement national pharmacare and help the nearly one million Canadians \"who skimp on food and heat to be able to pay for the medications they depend on.\"\n\nIn June, the advisory council that the Liberals set up to look into pharmacare tabled a final report with some awfully big numbers. If, as recommended, the government starts with a stripped-down version of the program covering only \"essential'\"medicines in 2022, the net annual cost would be $4.1 billion. And as the list of eligible drugs expands, along with the number of users, the price tag would grow to $15.3 billion a year by 2027.\n\nMichael Law, an associate professor of public health at the University of British Columbia and the Canada research chair in access to medicines, said it's hard to reconcile the Liberals' ambitions with the $6 billion sum and the multiple objectives on offer.\n\n\"It might go toward some of the groundwork to get things started,\" he said. \"But what they are currently proposing to spend is nowhere near what they would have to spend to set up a national pharmacare program.\"\n\nTrudeau's promise to improve access to mental health services \u2014 so that \"Canadians can get the support they need quickly, when they need it most\" \u2014 would also be costly.\n\nLast year, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) produced a report that looked at spending on mental health versus physical health in Canada. Right now, only 7.2 per cent of the federal health care budget is dedicated to mental well-being. And the 2017 pot-sweetener that dedicated $5 billion more over 10 years barely moved the needle, increasing slightly the share of federal health spending going to mental health from 7 per cent.\n\nFardous Hosseiny, the CMHA's interim chief executive, said getting to nine per cent would take an additional $3.1 billion a year \u2014 which would still be well below the spending level his organization wants to see.\n\n\"More investment is always welcome,\" he said. \"But it won't take one budget, or even one government, to right-size that funding gap.\"\n\nToo many patients, not enough doctors\n\nThen there's that Liberal pledge to provide everyone with access to a family doctor.\n\nIn 2017, Canada had 86,644 practising physicians, which works out to 234 doctors per 100,000 population. That's slightly more than Mexico, slightly fewer than the United States \u2014 but well below the levels in Argentina, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, all of which have ratios closer to 400 doctors per 100,000 population.\n\nCIHI reports that gross clinical payments to physicians amounted to $26.4 billion in 2016-17 \u2014 a 2.8 per cent increase over the year before, with an average payment of $342,000 per doctor.\n\nStatistics Canada estimates that there are now 4.7 million people who don't (by circumstance or choice) have a primary health care provider. Offering them the same level of access as other Canadians would mean adding at least 11,000 more doctors \u2014 which, at current payment rates, adds up to an additional $3.76 billion a year in health costs.\n\nAnd keep in mind that the country already is having difficulty finding enough residency spots for the record number of students graduating from medical schools.\n\nA hostile provincial climate\n\nOf course, party pledges to \"fix\" Canada's health care system are a staple of almost every election, provincial and federal.\n\n\"The Liberals first promised medicare in 1919 under William Lyon Mackenzie King,\" said Dr. Michael Rachlis, a public health physician and adjunct professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. \"And they took until 1968 \u2014 47 years \u2014 to pass the legislation.\"\n\nRachlis noted that these current Liberal goals come with a number of caveats and all depend on more \"collaborative\" negotiations with the provinces and territories \u2014 many of which are led by Conservative governments.\n\n\"If they're re-elected, they're going to face really hostile provincial governments who won't want to do any of this stuff with them,\" said Rachlis. \"These are nice promises that the Liberals are never going to have to fulfil.\"\n\nThe Verdict: False. Filling the gaps in Canada's health care system will take billions of dollars more than the Liberals have put on the table, and a level of political goodwill that probably doesn't exist right now.", "description": "Justin Trudeau is promising that every Canadian will have access to necessary medicines, a family doctor and mental health services.
