As she made promises to him, he climbed into the boot of her car.\n\nBut, unable to bring himself to trust her, Tony made an attempt to escape when he saw the village coming into sight. Distracted by Tony\u2019s actions, Breda smashed into the equipment, putting both herself and Tony in serious calamity.\n\nBut she is just triggering the beginning of an even wider disaster. The heavy equipment on the unstable ground was already dangerous enough but this impact has seen the ground start to give way and the tunnels beneath the village start to gill with debris as a cave-in is moments away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Tony escapes Breda\u2019s clutches or whether this could be the end for them but a broken Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) is about to make the situation a whole lot worse after hitting the bottle.\n\nDevastated by the discovery that Cindy knew the truth about DJ\u2019s paternity, he dismisses any chance of a future for them together and climbs drunkenly into the digger himself \u2013 with horrifying consequences which see beams fly towards the village below and the tunnels give way.\n\nWith several residents left in the line of fire and trapped beneath rubble, will everyone make it out of the situation alive?\n\nIt\u2019s looking particularly unsettling for Scott Drinkwell (Ross Adams) and Mitchell Deveraux (Imran Adams), who have snuck into the florists for a liaison. But as the disaster unfolds, will it be their last moments?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Breda triggers a major catastrophe.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-HOLLYOAKS-STUNT-01-603a_1572284473.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
