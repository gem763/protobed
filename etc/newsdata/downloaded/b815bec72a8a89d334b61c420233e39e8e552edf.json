This wasn\u2019t a show trial\u2019\n\nWhen I saw the video of people chanting \u2018lock him up\u2019 at the World Series I thought \u2018ha ha.\u2019 And then I moved on with my life. Sadly others did not. Despite the fact America is supposed to be a democracy where free speech is sacrosanct the incident sparked pearl-clutching amongst pundits and politicians who seem to think chanting represents a dire threat to the very soul of America. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, for example, said it reminded him \u201cof things that happen in countries where rule of law is unknown or unestablished.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s get a grip shall we? This wasn\u2019t a show trial. It wasn\u2019t an AR-15-wielding mob. It wasn\u2019t a threat to due process. It was a group of people spontaneously expressing frustration that the president of America hasn\u2019t been held properly accountable for any of the many crimes he has been accused of\u2014from sexual assault to election-meddling\u2014and openly boasts about being above the law. Only a few days earlier one of Trump\u2019s lawyers argued he couldn\u2019t be investigated by local authorities while in office even if he murdered someone on Fifth Avenue. You know what reminds me of countries where the rule of law is unknown? A head of state who thinks he has carte blanche to do whatever he likes. Not a few chants.\n\nBut what about all the \u2018lock her up\u2019 chants? some people have argued. You hypocritical libs were outraged about that. On Monday, for example, NBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough snarkily tweeted: \u201cLet\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got this straight. When crowds chant \u2018Lock her up\u2019 toward Hillary, it is illiberal and anti-American. (I agree). But when crowds chant the same toward Trump, it is suddenly a fulsome exercise of sacred First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nNo Joe, you haven\u2019t got it straight. There is a big difference between people in a baseball stadium spontaneously chanting and politicians stirring crowds at rallies up into a frenzy of rage over unfounded accusations. Had Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton been encouraging the stadium to protest then you might have a point there. But unless there\u2019s some secret Clinton plot I don\u2019t know about that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nAs for all the people complaining about how this is yet another example of the erosion of civility in America: please get your effing priorities right.\n\nArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist\n\n\u2018Lock him up\u2019 is a demand for mob justice\n\nOn Sunday night, Donald Trump received a dose of his own medicine. After being introduced at game three of baseball\u2019s World Series, the crowd booed the president, and then launched into a chant of \u201clock him up\u201d.\n\nWith Melania by his side, Trump finally heard first-hand what much of blue America thought of the vulgarian-in-chief. Make no mistake, Trump had definitely earned the fans\u2019 disgust and ire. Turnabout is fair play, to a point.\n\nDuring Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Trump had fanned the flames of birtherism. On the 2016 campaign trail, Trump had mocked a reporter for being disabled, trashed a federal judge for being Latino, and repeatedly delivered a verbal beatdown to the now late Senator John McCain for having been a prisoner of war. Grace was never part of Trump\u2019s vocabulary or mien.\n\nBut most memorably, it was Trump who would lead his minions in the cry of \u201clock her up\u201d \u2013 even after he was ensconced in the Oval Office. The past was never past.\n\nDue process was for his supporters, not his political opponents. Indeed, Trump saw them as his enemies. The bile that Trump vented on stage was no act but rather the core of his DNA.\n\nAnd yet that can only be part of the story. Although Trump has debased the presidency as he conflated the office with himself, his opponents \u2013 of which there are many and whose disdain in more than justified \u2013 need to think long and hard about echoing the very line that had rendered Trump unfit to hold and keep his current job.\n\n\u201cLock him up\u201d is more than a sentiment. Rather, it is a demand for mob justice, one at odds with the rule of law, qualitatively different from simply voicing disapproval.\n\nTo be sure, politicians get booed at ballgames. Presidents Hoover and Truman were on the receiving end in their day.\n\nBy contrast, a demand for instant imprisonment of our government officials is not what democracies are about. We remain defined by our processes despite their seeming inconvenience.\n\nThis coming Thursday, the House of Representatives will take up a resolution to guide its impeachment investigation, a process a federal judge last Friday found to be constitutionally valid and legally compliant.\n\n\u201cLike him up\u201d got Trump\u2019s attention. But it\u2019s no substitute for the work that remains to be done.", "description": "Lloyd Green and Arwa Mahdawi go head to head on whether the chants crossed a line", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi", "Lloyd Green"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a252422ed1a0c294f72b63a80c56dbb5b88595/0_49_1367_820/master/1367.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fdfd3aec58c1d3c631536f4e1727de69", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
