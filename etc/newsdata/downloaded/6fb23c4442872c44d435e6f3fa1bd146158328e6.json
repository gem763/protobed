REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nAt the last press conference of his eight-year tenure, the man credited with saving the euro from collapsing kept the door open to even more easy money, days before he hands the reins over to Christine Lagarde on Oct 31.\n\nWith inflation languishing at less than half the ECB\u2019s target and an unprecedented revolt against his brand of monetary stimulus, it was hardly a grand finale for Draghi, whose 2012 pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro quashed speculation against the bloc\u2019s most heavily indebted countries.\n\nDraghi refused to give specific advice to Lagarde but said his legacy was defined by a single-minded quest to boost price growth in an ailing and divided currency bloc.\n\n\u201cThis is part of our legacy: never give up!\u201d Draghi said.\n\nUnder him, the ECB abandoned its roots in German monetary orthodoxy, pushing the interest on bank deposits well below zero and buying 2.6 trillion euro worth of assets, mostly government bonds.\n\nDraghi has credited this policy with averting deflation in the euro zone and helping create 11 million jobs in the bloc.\n\nBut more than a third of the ECB\u2019s Governing Council opposed a decision to resume bond purchases at the September meeting, and policymakers from the Netherlands, France and Germany took the unusual step of making their disagreement public.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a few prominent hawks who question the wisdom of even more bond buys.\n\nSome 95% of respondents in a Reuters poll of analysts said the stimulus package would not significantly help in bringing inflation back to the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2%.\n\nThe ECB made no new policy moves on Thursday, having decided in September to restart bond purchases at a pace of 20 billion euros per month while also cutting its deposit rate to -0.5% and keeping the door open to further reductions.\n\nDespite weak growth across the euro zone, Draghi insisted the benefits of loose money policy far outweighed the risks and rejected the suggestion that the public spat had tainted his legacy.\n\n\u201cEvery jurisdiction has disagreements when monetary policy decisions come to be discussed,\u201d Draghi said.\n\nHe added dissenters seemed to bury the hatchet at Thursday\u2019s meeting, with one calling for unity and another saying that \u201cbygones are bygones\u201d.\n\nA source at the meeting said the climate was more consensual than in September, with dissenters refraining from bringing up their concerns again when the policy proposal was made.\n\nTURMOIL WILL CONTINUE\n\nYet turmoil within the ECB was likely to persist, and Lagarde will have to deal with objections that the ultra-easy policy hurts savers, squeezes banks and pension funds and inflates financial bubbles while doing little for inflation.\n\nThis was just 0.8% in September, a far cry from the ECB\u2019s target of below but close to 2%.\n\nThis goal may change under Lagarde, who has pledged to review the ECB\u2019s strategy, following in the footsteps of the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cShe may wait until a review of the ECB\u2019s monetary policy has been conducted in order to decide if Draghi\u2019s motto remains valid,\u201d said Rene Albrecht, an analyst at DZ Bank.\n\nThe problem for the ECB is that some of the major factors depressing prices are outside its control.\n\nThese range from demographic and technological changes to the euro zone\u2019s reliance on exports, in particular by German manufacturers, which leaves it bearing the brunt of a global trade war.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nWith the ECB\u2019s firepower now largely spent, Draghi and his successor are likely to continue urging governments that are running surpluses, such as Germany and the Netherlands, to invest more to generate economic growth at home.\n\nBut the latest budget figures showing only a modest expansion suggest these calls are likely to go unheard for now, leaving the burden on the ECB.\n\n\u201cMonetary policy will continue to do its job,\u201d Draghi said.", "description": "European Central Bank President Mario Draghi told his successor on Thursday to \"never give up\" on propping up the euro zone economy in the face of a worsening outlook and little help from governments.", "authors": ["Francesco Canepa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444492631&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N12M", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
