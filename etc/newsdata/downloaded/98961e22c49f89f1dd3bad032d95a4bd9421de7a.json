Ho! The Clintons Have Got to Go", "language": "en", "text": "On Friday night, HBO host and liberal commentator Bill Maher, once again, said something most Americans can get behind: the Clintons need to \"go away\" and by go away, we mean they should step away from politics and enjoy the retired life.\n\n\"It seems like every few months Hillary Clinton bubbles up again. And people like 'She\u2019s thinking about running again' or she says something crazy,\" Maher said. \"You know, last Friday there was a news dump. They exonerated her again about the emails. You know, I\u2019m not - it\u2019s not about that but the Clintons, they gotta go away.\"\n\nAccording to the late night host, both Hillary and Bill need to also avoid the Democratic National Convention. In his mind, it's dangerous for the Democrats to be associated with the Clintons. If Hillary, in particular, stays prevalent, then she is a \"Donald Trump asset.\"\n\n\"I'm saying this now, a year out: they can't be at the convention. Maybe on the video, waiving or something, but I'm serious. She is one of the biggest vote getters,\" he explained. \"Justin Amash, is that how you say it, he said the one thing we know for sure is that Hillary Clinton is a Donald Trump asset. Somebody said she's a Russian asset. She is. And Bill is damaged goods. I just think they gotta go away. We can't be associated, the Democratic Party.\"\n\nTruth be told, Americans are tired of the Clintons. They continually lie about cheat. Just look at Hillary. She still can't accept that she lost the 2016 election. Just last month she claimed that \"voter suppression\" was what kept her from being president and Stacey Abrams from being Governor of Georgia. Funny part about that whole saga: she's upset that voting rolls were purged of those who died or moved but states did it to keep in compliance with the Motor Voter Act her husband signed into law while he was president!\n\nHillary was never held accountable for what took place in Benghazi or her email scandal. The Clintons are symbolic of everything wrong with American politics. They represent the elite politicians that are so out-of-touch with reality that they have no clue what's going on outside the Beltway.\n\nMaher is right. The Clintons need to just go... and far, far away.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Buh-bye..10/26/2019 20:06:54PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/299/243fe13c-d710-44f4-9cb4-052e9b04ff6f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
