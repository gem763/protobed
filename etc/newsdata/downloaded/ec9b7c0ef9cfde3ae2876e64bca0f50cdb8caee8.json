An investigatory procedure revealed that Eleanor had a one in a million condition.\n\n\"You must have been very shocked?,\" Ruth Langsford asked Eleanor as she appeared on the daytime show to share her incredible story.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"I hadn't heard of it before so it was very shocking,\" replied Eleanor, who said externally everything looked completely normal.\n\nThe condition known as uterus didelphys - a rare congenital abnormality - developed when Eleanor was a feutus.\n\nDoctors told Eleanor her chances of becoming a mum would be near impossible and gave her a 95% miscarriage rate.\n\n\"I was told my two wombs were so small that they wouldn't stretch enough during pregnancy,\" she explained.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nA year after freezing her eggs, Eleanor met her now husband Chris. Despite the risks involved, the couple decided to try for a family.\n\n\"I got pregnant in the right womb, which was the inferior of the two wombs,\" said Eleanor.\n\n\"Sadly, we lost the baby. Even though we knew to prepare for the worst nothing can prepare you for that loss.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nMonths later, Eleanor fell pregnant again in her left womb.\n\nShe was immediately referred to a high risk unit and monitored constantly. The mum-to-be was also given medication to take every day to prevent her from going into early labour.\n\nAgainst all the odds, Eleanor made it to 35 weeks before welcoming a baby girl via C-section, who she named Imogen Hope.\n\nAfter recounting her dramatic year, the mum was joined on This Morning by her husband Chris and their daughter.\n\n\"She's our miracle baby. Its been quite the journey,\" said proud dad Chris, as he showed three month old Imogen off to the camera.\n\n\"I hope that by sharing our story we can encourage anyone to think they can too beat the odds,\" added Eleanor.\n\nShe said that she'd been asked many times how could she have possibly not known she was any different until her mid thirties.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n\"Externally everything was normal. There was no way I could have known,\" said Eleanor.\n\nDr Zoe explained: \"Even in a cervical smear you wouldn't be able to detect it.\"\n\nEleanor said that she had bravely shared her story to encourage other women to speak out and seek help for similar issues.\n\n\"Nobody should feel ashamed of their body no matter what differences they have,\" she said.", "description": "Eleanor Rowe, 36, discovered her unusual anatomy five years ago when she went to freeze her eggs", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20705460.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-23-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
