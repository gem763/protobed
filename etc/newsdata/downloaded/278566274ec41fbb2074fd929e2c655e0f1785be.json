This is why so many of the best-performing stocks were beaten-down names that have begun building a base. Just for clarification, \u2018beaten down\u2019 means it is a lowered share price, but that doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s oversold. Sometimes these stocks are still overvalued and pausing before the next leg lower.\n\nThat being said, in a market driven by machines and emotions, even great stocks can see their share price become oversold.\n\nSo, buyers bought \u201ccheap\u201d stocks and bid up the Russell 2000 again, as that index is now up more than 3% in the last five sessions but up only 13% for 2019.\n\nThe Biggest Bottom Fish\n\nThe kind of bottom fishing seen since late summer is often done by professional money managers in hopes of catching an upside pop that helps their performance catch up. That\u2019s what happened to Netflix (NFLX) after the close. The company posted its financial results:\n\nRevenue: $5.24 billion, consensus: $5.25 billion\n\nEarnings: $1.47, consensus: $1.04\n\nDomestic subscribers: 517,000, consensus: 802,000\n\nInternational subscribers: 6.26 million, consensus: 6.05 million\n\n64 million watched \u201cStranger Things\u201d in four weeks\n\nI was very impressed with the continued contributing growth in margins.\n\nThe talking heads spent most of the evening trying to talk the stock lower, which makes me think it could hold onto last night\u2019s gains. The stock is oversold, and while few would call it a value investment after $300, the next big resistance point is $336.00.\n\nBy the way, Netflix\u2019s DVD business is still around. Last quarter, there were 16,000 free trials and 2,276,000 subscribers generating $71.9 million in revenue and sporting a 61.3% margin.\n\nThere is a 5% short position of Netflix shares. The squeeze could be powerful; however, I think once all the new rivals have been officially on the scene for six months to a year, we\u2019ll discover Netflix will remain the top choice of consumers, and the stock will probably reflect that value (which will be higher than where the stock opened today).\n\nBetween now and then, look for talking heads to jawbone the stock, even as the investment proposition improves.\n\nPortfolio Approach", "description": "Yesterday was one of those sessions where the market couldn\u2019t .10/17/2019 10:18:16AM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/11/a334f387-c2c7-4563-b5f0-c05d73584e54.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
