Like everything else running on electricity in 600,000 Californian homes and businesses this week, her oxygen concentrator stopped working when the country\u2019s largest utility company cut power to an unprecedented swath of the state as a preventive measure against wildfires.\n\nIn a state gripped by climate crisis, where the biggest utility was found at fault in two of the deadliest wildfires in recent history, these preventive shutoffs are set to become the new normal. But the impacts of these power cuts are being disproportionately borne by the physically vulnerable, disability rights advocates said.\n\nRelated: California wildfire spreads as fears mount over further power shutoffs\n\nAnd for Californians like Mediati who rely on electronic medical devices, access to electricity is a matter of life or death.\n\n\u201cI had to be woken up because I stopped breathing,\u201d Mediati said. \u201cI could have died.\u201d\n\nIn the latest shutoff in northern California, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) cut the power to portions of 34 of the state\u2019s 58 counties on Wednesday, a move that affects more than 1.5 million people. Of those affected, more than 30,000 are part of a medical baseline program, meaning they have special energy needs due to qualifying medical conditions.\n\nThese energy needs range from motorized wheelchairs, ventilators, dialysis machines, apnea monitors, electrostatic nebulizers to respirators \u2013 all of which require power to operate. In the aftermath of the shutdown, people dependent on these devices were scrambling to find alternative power sources, places to charge them or other ways to get through what was originally slated to be up to five to seven days of no electricity.\n\nBeyond medical baseline customers, an unknown number of other affected Californians may be medically fragile and dependent on electricity in other ways. Rebecca Fortelka, who has cerebral palsy and a connective tissue disorder, is \u201cheavily reliant\u201d on electricity, not just because of her power wheelchair, but because the air cleaning system she has to run continuously to keep her environmental allergies from flaring up.\n\n\u201cI also have medication that needs to refrigerated at all times due to DVT and blood clots,\u201d said Fortelka, 30. \u201cI also am on a special diet because of food allergies and autoimmune conditions so that food is expensive, and if it spoils due to power outage that is huge blow to me financially.\u201d\n\nFortelka, who lives in Livermore, an inland city east of San Francisco, has been without power for 48 hours. Though PG&E sent an email to medical baseline customers stating that it \u201cwill be calling, texting and emailing you\u201d to alert about power shutdowns, both Fortelka and Mediati said they didn\u2019t get any prior warning. \u201cMy mom went to our local PG&E office and was told we have to fend for ourselves because medical baseline doesn\u2019t count in this situation,\u201d she said.\n\nMediati kept hearing about the possibility of a shutoff, but received no confirmation of one happening \u2013 and with previous shutoffs bypassing her area in Grass Valley, just outside Tahoe national forest, she and her husband were not prepared.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was going to pass us by,\u201d she said. \u201cI was up in the middle of the night scrambling for another hose for my emergency oxygen tank so I could go back to sleep. It\u2019s just crazy.\u201d\n\nPG&E set up community resource centers that had power, but for the medically fragile, getting to those places can be more dangerous than staying home. Fortelka and her family had to purchase a generator, which cost $10,000 \u2013 and costs $1,000 to $1,200 to run each day on diesel fuel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s kind of this myth that disasters affect everyone and they\u2019re this great equalizer and that\u2019s just absolutely not true,\u201d said Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management and disaster science at the University of Nebraska Omaha. \u201cWe tend to see different groups of people who bear the brunt of those impacts and struggle to find the resources to address those impacts.\u201d", "description": "The impacts of the electricity cut are being disproportionately felt by those dependent on medical devicesA power shutoff in northern California left many homes and businesses in the dark on Thursday.
