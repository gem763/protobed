And they spend a lot \u2013 approximately 18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), or more than $10 000 per individual a year on average. Medical bills also contribute to up to 50 percent of bankruptcies in the country.\n\nThe study looked at six \u201cdomains\u201d of waste, finding the most significant problems in the realm of administrative tasks \u2013 such as billing, recordkeeping and other clerical activities \u2013 which account for some $266 billion of the total waste.\n\nAlso on rt.com Big pharma war: India slams US for crusading against cheap generics\n\nDr. Donald Berwick, CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, said much of the waste is linked to number of \u201cpayers\u201d in the system, resulting in extra complication and reams of paperwork.\n\n\u201cRight now you're billed for the hospital room, by the ambulance company, by every doctor, rehab facility \u2013 everyone is keeping their own records and doing their own billing and dividing it up into tiny pieces, which makes it hard for the patient and hard for the caregivers,\u201d Berwick told CBS News.\n\nComing in second place behind administrative costs is the pricing system itself, where fees have vastly outpaced the consumer price index (CPI) \u2013 a statistical tool used to determine the general rate of price inflation \u2013 making up between $231 and $241 billion of the yearly waste.\n\n\u201cThe prices of health care don't reflect what would happen in a competitive market,\u201d Berwick said.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Astronomical\u2019 US drug prices see people drive to Canada for life-saving insulin\n\nAmong the factors keeping healthcare prices inflated are an onerous licensing system, regulations, as well as lobbying from special interests in the medical field, which together help to restrict \u201cthe supply of physicians, hospitals, insurance and pharmaceuticals,\u201dwrites market analyst Mike Holly.\n\nThe other four domains \u2013 failures in care delivery and care coordination, overtreatment and fraud and abuse \u2013 accounted for another $400 billion of waste or excess spending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem,\u201d Berwick said of fraud and abuse, including the outright \u201coverbilling\u201d of customers. \u201cI don't know any other industry in which it's this onerous, and where it's taking money right out of the wallets of patients and families who are bearing greater and greater burdens of payment.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
