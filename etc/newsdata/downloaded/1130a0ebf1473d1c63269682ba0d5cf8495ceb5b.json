It\u00b4s been made very clear that this is moving forward,\" said Toot Wolff, principal of world champions Mercedes.\n\n\"There will be tweaks and changes in detail and interpretations but broadly I think this is moving forward.\"\n\nThe 2021 sporting and technical regulations are due to be published next week.\n\n\"I think with hindsight we would have been better bringing the cap in first for 2021 and then taking more time to develop these regulations and evolve them and bring them in for 2022, so that any development the big teams undertake would be under the umbrella of the cap,\" said Horner.\n\nWolff said there had been an argument to bring the cost cap forward to next year and implement the technical and sporting regulations in 2021, but that was not an option.\n\n\"The single most important factor is the auditing and policing process and none of that is in place for 2020,\" he said.\n\n\"And obviously if you can\u00b4t police it in the right way, it makes no sense to implement the rule.\"\n\nWolff said pushing the introduction of the rule changes back a year was more logical but the idea \"didn\u00b4t gain the traction and didn\u00b4t trigger enough appetite with the ones that decide.\"\n\nFormula One's commercial rights holders Liberty Media and the governing FIA are keen to level the playing field and reduce costs to make the racing more competitive.\n\nSome teams, such as McLaren, are keen to stick to the proposed timetable.\n\n\"We like what is on the table now, what we have seen last week also, in terms of what\u00b4s coming in on the technical side, the sporting side and on the financial side,\" said team boss Andreas Seidl.
