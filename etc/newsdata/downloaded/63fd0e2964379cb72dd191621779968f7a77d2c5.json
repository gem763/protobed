They sat on the hands, on the whole, and notwithstanding a slightly saccharine exchange of mutual admiration between Speaker Bercow and Michael Gove, the frostiness was understandable.\n\nYou\u2019d never have thought that Mr Gove had, not so long ago, actively tried to get rid of Bercow.

If there was a large Tory majority, it would allow, perhaps, for a more compliant, sympathetic Speaker to be selected, one less inclined to allow the Commons to take control of its affairs; and one more willing to allow ministers to exercise their usual prerogatives. More of a Boris stooge, in other words.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Of the two it is Mr Bryant who would be the bolder, Bercowesque choice; but also one that could not be faulted on any objective grounds.\n\nIn any case, John Bercow was due to step down very soon anyway, and the assembly of a new parliament in a few weeks would be the normal time to do so. He has now prevented his enemies in the House \u2013 and there are some \u2013 from electing a sort of anti-Bercow as the next speaker \u2013 someone such as Nigel Evans, a former deputy speaker or even Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose standing has declined somewhat in recent days.\n\nAs for Bercow's record, well, they say history is written by the victors. Not since Edwardian times has parliament been subject to such trials and stresses as it has been in the past few years. Most of Bercow's decade-long Speakership he has overseen hung parliaments \u2013 and then the fractures of Brexit. The show, it has to be said, is still on the road, at least, and British parliamentary democracy is still functioning, after a fashion. That it is doing so at all is perhaps the greatest of Bercow\u2019s many achievements in his role.\n\nThe momentous nature of the times he found himself in have overshadowed his other reforming work in the Commons, which carried more energy than most speakers, and his efforts \u2013 not entirely successful \u2013 to restore some of the prestige of our parliamentarians, lost after the expenses\u2019 scandal.\n\nBercow, among his global TV audience, will also be remembered for his orotund tones and mannered speech, inspired apparently by the novels of Jane Austen. Still, \u201cMr Squeaker\u201d as his sometimes silly and obsessional critics called him, will remain a controversial figure long into his retirement. He at least deserves to put his trotters up.", "description": "After his emotional, amusing and typically Bercovian valedictory performance \u2013 including an especially flamboyant tie by Van Buck of England \u2013 the opposition benches rose to give John Bercow a standing ovation.\u00a0 Unsurprisingly the great majority of those who found themselves on the Conservative benches did not follow suit.
