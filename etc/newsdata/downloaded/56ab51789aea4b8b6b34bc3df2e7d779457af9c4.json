This has been done after studying the pattern and evaluating the risk,\u201d said DGCA.\n\nIndiGo had 89 A320neos as of 30 September.\n\nPratt & Whitney's aircraft engines are widely used in both civil and military aviation. The US aerospace manufacturer has seen delivery delays and groundings in India after spending $10 billion to develop fuel-efficient engines for single-aisle jets.\n\nAlso on rt.com Airbus to boost cooperation with China, Tianjin to be firm\u2019s manufacturing center in Asia\n\nIndiGo which is the world\u2019s biggest A320neo customer decided in June to order $20 billion worth of engines from a joint venture of General Electric and France\u2019s Safran. In August, DGCA ordered IndiGo and its rival Go Airlines India not to accept engines without a modified version of the 1100-series turbines.\n\nIn October, Indigo reported three in-flight engine shutdowns on the A320 (Neo) fitted with PW engines.According to the regulator, the glitches followed 15 in-flight shutdowns, turnarounds or rejected takeoffs Indian carriers experienced due to failure of the low-pressure turbines in the past three years through August.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "India threatens to ground Airbus jets over engine failures", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db8426320302760493c1b1e.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
