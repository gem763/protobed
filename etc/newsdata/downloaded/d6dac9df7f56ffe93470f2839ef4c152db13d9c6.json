USA TODAY\n\nJames Harden is not interested in wading any further into the NBA's ongoing dispute with China.\n\nBack at practice in Houston for the first time since returning from a preseason trip to Japan, the Rockets star said Sunday he doesn't intend to address the controversy anymore. During a scrum with reporters, Harden tried to steer the conversation back to basketball and the upcoming season.\n\n\"I'm staying out of it,\" said Harden. \"I'm focusing on what we have and trying to get better. We're a week and a half away from the regular season.\"\n\nHarden referenced the Rockets' early-season struggles last year as a major motivator. Houston stumbled to an 11-14 start last season, and Harden believes eliminating distractions will help the Rockets avoid a similar fate this year.\n\n\"I remember last year, we didn't get off to a great start. We had to climb out of that hole,\" Harden said. \"So this year, we\u2019re trying to avoid that and trying to get off to a better start, and it starts now.\"\n\nHere's Rockets James Harden today when asked about distractions, etc. regarding the situation surrounding China/NBA. @KPRC2@SportsTalk790pic.twitter.com/exCCGZZz8A \u2014 Adam Wexler (@KPRC2AdamW) October 13, 2019\n\nThe NBA's annual trip to China was enveloped in controversy before it even began last week when Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted and deleted a message of support for protesters in Hong Kong. Morey's tweet sparked outrage in China and threatened to derail the league's longstanding and lucrative relationship with the country.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets played a pair of exhibition games as scheduled, but they lacked the usual fanfare of NBA games in China. Events promoting the games were cancelled, as were planned press conferences with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, coaches and players. State broadcaster CCTV did not air either game.\n\nMORE ON CHINA\n\nTencent, the NBA's media partner in China, said it would re-evaluate its coverage of the league, and Chinese shoe company Anta Sports announced it would suspend contract renewal negotiations with NBA players.\n\nMorey has kept a low profile since the initial tweet. His only public remarks since have come in two follow-up tweets in which he did not apologize but did say his tweets \"in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\"\n\nHouston coach Mike D'Antoni and other Rockets players seemed eager Sunday to join Harden in turning the page on the controversy.\n\n\"It is a distraction,\" said D'Antoni. \"But guys can handle it. We still got good work in. Everything's fine. It happens. It's regrettable that it happened, but as I said, our work will get done.\"\n\nFollow Matt Eppers on Twitter @meppers_.", "description": "James Harden made it known he doesn't intend to address the controversy anymore, steering the conversation back to basketball and the upcoming season.", "authors": ["Matt Eppers", "Published P.M.
