Davis noted he was \u201ctrying to prove a point of how bad your bill is\u201d to the Democrats on the committee.\n\nDavis criticized the \u201cpartisanship\u201d involved in putting the SHIELD Act together, adding that there are \u201clegitimate election security concerns\u201d that the bill is meant to address and questioning why Lofgren and other committee Democrats did not work to find a \u201cbipartisan solution to our collective concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the majority has chosen to continue this pattern we\u2019ve seen all Congress where they rush legislation, without any hearings or public discussion of the issues, and insert poison pills into a bill that they know we will not support, all in an effort to prop up their unfounded impeachment efforts against the president,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis noted that he could not support the bill in its entirety, even as he was in favor of some aspects, due to concerns that it would violate First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cI believe the SHIELD Act will have many unintended, but severe consequences on the American people and a chilling effect on free speech, a fundamental right we in Congress have a responsibility to defend,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis vowed to bring up his concerns with the SHIELD Act on the House floor when it is brought up for a vote, noting his belief that it is \u201cunfixable in its current form.\u201d\n\nThe approval of the SHIELD Act on Wednesday comes after the House Administration Committee approved the two previous Democrat-backed election security bills that were later passed by the House along party lines.\n\nThese bills were the For the People Act, a sweeping voting reform and security bill, and the SAFE Act, which zeros in on increasing the security of voting infrastructure.\n\nBoth have stalled in the Senate due to Republican concerns over elections being federalized, and due to concerns that language included did not address election security.", "description": "The House Administration Committee voted 6-1 on Tuesday to push forward legislation intended to limit foreign interference in elections, moving the bill to the House floor for a vote against strong Republican objections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/electionsecurity_071919istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
