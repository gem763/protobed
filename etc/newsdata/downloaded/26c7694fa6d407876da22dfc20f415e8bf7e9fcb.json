Cattermole revealed that he felt forced into the relationship by execs, and that it \u201cdid not happen organically\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t like Spearritt or enjoy the relationship.\n\n\u201cYeah, but like I say. It didn\u2019t feel like that because I had totally grown into the idea, quite quickly. I thought she was great,\u201d Cattermole replied when asked if he felt forced.\n\nAlthough the relationship was a bit of a sham, at least the band were actually friends.\n\n\u201cWe were closer than many pop groups \u2013 people that used to work with us said: \u2018Wow, you guys actually speak, you actually stay in the same room.\u2019 Most of them don\u2019t,\u201d Cattermole said.\n\nS Club 7, consisting of Tina Barrett, Rachel Stevens, Jo O\u2019Meara, Bradley McIntosh, Jon Lee as well as Hannah Spearritt and Paul Cattermole, was one of the biggest pop groups to come out of the UK since the Spice Girls. The group was even founded by Spice Girls creator Simon Fuller.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t listening to Don\u2019t Stop Movin\u2019 on your Sony Discman while choreographing dance routines in your bedroom, you weren\u2019t living. S Club 7 were iconic.\n\nAfter Paul Cattermole\u2019s departure in 2002, the band remained together for a year before calling it quits too.\n\n\u201cIt is so important to remember how great so many things about the band were and, like you said, that time in people\u2019s lives. That optimistic time,\u201d Cattermole reminisced his S Club 7 days.\n\nBut apparently forced relationships are kinda his thing, because he\u2019s calling on the TV execs to set him up with another girl for this year\u2019s First Dates Hotel.", "description": "S Club 7 star Paul Cattermole revealed that his off-screen relationship with bandmate Hannah Spearritt was orchestrated by television executives.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/s-club-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
