He said he said \"five and last\". He kept five and last in the air. That's what he told me,' the English forward told The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n'I said to him \"did you not call six again\" and he said 'no, I called \"five and last\".'\n\nBut rather than ruing refereeing decisions, the Raiders captain instead focused on how his side failed to make the most of their second-half superiority.\n\n'With the amount of possession we had in the second half - we couldn't capitalise. To lose it when it was so close, it's hard to take,' he said.\n\nReplays show him (in yellow) putting his hand up to signal a new set for the Raiders before yelling 'last, it's still last' repeatedly\n\nSpeaking to Channel 9 after the match, Mr Annesley said he had a 'closer look' at the moment, observed four different camera angles and determined the ball did come off the shoulder of a Raiders player.\n\n'The referee does call six more but immediately gets a call from the assistant referee and one of the touch judges that it was off a Raiders player. He immediately corrected that call and called last tackle, and called last tackle four more times before the play actually broke down,' Mr Annesley said.\n\n'It's very disappointing that the game has been marred in controversy after that initial six again call, but ultimately I believe the decision not to give six more tackles was correct.\n\nCanberra's captain Josh Hodgson has now revealed he asked the veteran official straight after the incident whether he had signalled for a new set - to which he replied 'no, I called 'five and last'\n\n'Had they not corrected that decision, I'd probably be standing here talking to you now about the fact that a try may have been scored in the next set off an incorrect decision where the six tackles shouldn't have been awarded.'\n\nMr Annesley said the incident was one of the reasons the NRL uses 'multiple officials', in a bid to get decisions right.\n\n'If we'd had one referee tonight we would have got the decision wrong,' he said.\n\nThe 'six again' moment was one of several controversial decisions that went against the Raiders in their first Grand Final appearance in 25 years.\n\nIn the opening stages, a charged down kick which could have led to a Canberra Raiders try hit the Sydney Roosters physio on the field at the time in the head.\n\nThe Raiders were also denied a penalty try when Josh Papalii was tackled without the ball metres from the try-line, which resulted in the sin-binning of retiring Roosters star Cooper Cronk.\n\nFans and former players erupted with outrage after the full-time siren over the incident in the final moments which gave the Roosters victory.\n\nThe Sydney Roosters rule the roost once again after claiming back to back NRL premierships in a controversial grand final\n\n'Signalling six again & then changing their mind is the biggest referring blunder in grand final history... Absolute disgrace,' former Cronulla Sharks and Penrith Panthers star Martin Lang tweeted.\n\nActor Russell Crowe added: Horses**t result in the Grand Final. Yet another rugby League embarrassment. Raiders ripped off.'\n\nTIMELINE OF CONTROVERSIES 3rd minute: Charged down kick which could have led to a Canberra Raiders try hit a Sydney Roosters trainer on the field in the head. 6th minute: The Sydney Roosters draw first blood when hooker Sam Verrills scores the first game of the match 49th minute: Josh Papalii denied a penalty try when he was tackled without the ball.

I don't want to take the spotlight off that.\n\nStuart was also tight-lipped over the incident involving the Roosters physio in the opening stages.\n\n'It ricocheted off their trainer and we lose the advantage. You write what you want,' Stuart told reporters.\n\nThe Roosters led the Raiders 8-6 at half-time in front of a sell-out crowd of more than 80,000 fans at ANZ Stadium in Sydney.\n\nThe Raiders refused to give up without a fight and had the upper hand for much of the second half as the Roosters fought hard to survive to stay in the game\n\nThe Raiders hit back with a penalty goal equaliser to tie the game up at 8-all in the 50th minute after Roosters half-back Cooper Cronk was controversially sin-binned by referee Ben Cummins for a professional foul in his 375th and final NRL game.\n\nBut the Raiders were unable to capitalise on the one-man advantage with scores still tied at 8-all when Cronk returned to the field with 20 minutes to play.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking loss for the brave Canberra Raiders after a number of refereeing blunders went against them\n\nThe game erupted into controversy in the 50th minute when referee Ben Cummins sin-binned retiring NRL star Cooper Cronk\n\nThe Raiders hit back with a penalty goal equaliser to tie the game up at 8-all in the 50th minute after Roosters half-back Cooper Cronk was controversially sin-binned by referee Ben Cummins for a professional foul in his 375th and final NRL game.\n\nBut the Raiders were unable to capitalise on the one-man advantage with scores still tied at 8-all when Cronk returned to the field with 20 minutes to play.\n\nThe Roosters had a golden opportunity to regain the lead with 12 minutes to go but missed a penalty goal right in front.\n\nAll was forgiven by Roosters fans five minutes later when fullback James Tedesco raced away for their second try.\n\nThe try was converted for 14-8 Roosters lead with six minutes remaining.\n\nThe Canberra Raiders celebrate after they hit back in the 30th minute with a try to five-eighth Jack Wighton in the grand final\n\nThe Roosters drew first blood in the opening minutes after hooker Sam Verrills found his way to the try-line with a scurrying dash from dummy-half for a 6-0 lead after seven minutes.\n\nA penalty conversion from Latrell Mitchell increased the Roosters' lead to 8-0 halfway through the first half.\n\nThe Green Machine brought Raiders fans to their feet when they hit back in the 30th minute with a try to five-eighth Jack Wighton, which was then converted to trail 8-6.\n\nThe Roosters had a chance to increase their lead to 10-6 on the stroke of half-time but the long range penalty conversion attempt from Mitchell was waved away.\n\nThe Roosters played most of the match with 16 men after Mitchell Aubusson was carried from the field after injuring his knee while making a try-saving tackle on the Raiders' try-line.", "description": "The Sydney Roosters scored the NRL Grand Final's deciding try to make it 14-8 immediately after official Ben Cummins waved six more tackles to the Canberra Raiders before changing his mind.", "authors": ["Charlie Co\u00eb", "Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/23/19416908-0-image-a-37_1570487506510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
