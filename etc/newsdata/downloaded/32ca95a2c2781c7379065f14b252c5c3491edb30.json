There is also no question that defendants\u2019 violations harmed individual borrowers,\u201d Kim wrote in her ruling Thursday. \u201cDefendants have not provided evidence that they were unable to comply with the preliminary injunction, and the evidence shows only minimal efforts to comply.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe judge has ordered the department to provide monthly status reports on its efforts to follow her order and rectify the harm it inflicted upon borrowers. Failure to comply with this latest order could result in additional sanctions.\n\nThe Education Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn September, the federal agency revealed in a court filing that former Corinthian students \u201cwere incorrectly informed at one time or another \u2026 that they had payments due on their federal student loans\u201d after Kim put a hold on collections in May 2018.\n\nAlthough the agency has since stopped pursuing nearly 15,000 of those borrowers, it is still working to resolve the problem with the remaining borrowers. About 1,808 people lost wages or tax refunds as a result of the department\u2019s actions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Education Department has said it sent emails to the loan-servicing companies it pays to manage the federal student loan portfolio, directing them to postpone the payments of Corinthian students and halt collection of their debts. But the agency did not send specific instructions to the companies to postpone the payments indefinitely. Two department officials have since been disciplined, while the agency reprimanded loan servicers for their failings.\n\nAt a hearing on the matter this month, Kim said: \u201cI\u2019m not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know I have that ability. I\u2019m most concerned with helping the people who were harmed by this \u2014 this problem that the government created.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the borrowers proposed an array of sanctions, including fining DeVos $500 per day until the Education Department is fully compliant with the original court order.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToby Merrill, director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending, a legal-aid group representing the students, said the \u201crare and powerful action to hold the Secretary of Education in contempt of court shows the extreme harm\u201d of DeVos\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThousands of students illegally had their tax refunds seized and wages garnished, and the Department still can\u2019t identify all of the affected students nor refunded the money,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cThe judge is sending a loud and clear message: students have rights under the law and DeVos\u2019 illegal and reckless violation of their rights will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to stop the court from imposing sanctions, Justice Department attorneys representing DeVos and the Education Department argued in a court filing last week that the agency \u201chas been working diligently and in good faith to correct the errors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cerrors at issue here were not the result of any willful or intentional conduct on the part of the Department, but, as the Court has recognized, gross negligence, including negligent oversight of the Department\u2019s servicers,\u201d Justice Department attorneys wrote.\n\nDeVos also pointed fingers at loan servicers in a Twitter spat with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who blasted the education secretary for \u201crefusing to follow the law and stop punishing scammed students.\u201d\n\nDeVos responded: \u201cLoan servicers made an error on a small [number] of loans. We know and we\u2019re fixing it.\u201d\n\nA 1995 law known as \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d gives the Education Department authority to cancel the federal debt of students whose colleges misled them about graduation or job placement rates to get them to enroll. The closure of Corinthian, a chain felled by charges of fraud and predatory lending, ushered in a flood of claims at the Education Department.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe case stems from DeVos\u2019s decision in December 2017 to provide debt relief to former Corinthian students by comparing the average earnings of students in similar vocational programs. That earnings information was collected under the gainful-employment regulation, which penalizes career-training programs for producing too many graduates with more debt than they can repay.\n\nThe Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard University and the Housing and Economic Rights Advocates group sought an injunction in March 2018 to stop the practice. They argue that the Education Department has no right to use the data, which is supplied by the Social Security Administration, for any purpose other than to evaluate vocational programs. The attorneys also say denying full relief to Corinthian students is illegal.\n\nKim agreed that the Trump administration violated privacy laws by using Social Security Administration data to calculate loan forgiveness but refrained from declaring the partial relief plan illegal.\n\nShe banned the Education Department from using the earnings data to grant partial student debt relief to Corinthian students and halted collection on their loans. Kim had also put a hold on the case until the court could determine the proper course of action, but she lifted that stay this month, allowing the case to proceed.\n\nAD", "description": "The ruling comes after the agency revealed that it violated a court order to halt student debt collection on more than 16,000 former Corinthian Colleges students.", "authors": ["Danielle Douglas-Gabriel", "Reporter Covering The Economics Of Education"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8mxupnfzNWpV2zlz0gCWb8ZrGKY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YV6PCEXUHEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
