Lieberman has called for a broad unity government with the two major parties.\n\n\u201cJudging by the present situation assessment, Netanyahu is no longer capable of winning an election in Israel. This story is over,\u201d said Yossi Verter, political commentator for the Haaretz daily.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But it appears that Netanyahu\u2019s political instincts, once deemed impeccable, led to some questionable decisions that came back to hurt him in the latest campaign.\n\nNetanyahu, who turns 70 next month, has traditionally relied on a stable majority of ultra-Orthodox Jewish religious and hard-line nationalist parties. That alliance fell apart following elections in April when Lieberman, a longtime ally turned rival, refused to join a new coalition with religious partners.\n\nLieberman, a hawk like Netanyahu on security issues but also fiercely secular, said ultra-Orthodox parties had gained too much influence. Just short of a parliamentary majority, Netanyahu was forced to take the unprecedented step of holding a second election in a year.\n\nLooming over the campaign were Netanyahu\u2019s legal woes. Israel\u2019s attorney general has recommended indicting him on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges in a series of corruption scandals, pending a hearing scheduled in early October.\n\nNetanyahu had hoped to capture a narrow coalition of hard-line parties that would grant him immunity from prosecution.\n\nHe embarked on a campaign of stunts and promises aimed at shoring up his base. Borrowing tactics from the political playbook of his friend, President Donald Trump, he lashed out at the media, police, judiciary and election commission, alleging a vast conspiracy against him. He vowed to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank and threatened to unleash a war on Gaza militants.\n\nHe saved special vitriol for Israel\u2019s Arab minority, implying that they were a hostile fifth column out to destroy the nation. He tried, and failed, to pass legislation that would install monitoring cameras in voting booths as he made unfounded claims of fraud in Arab districts. An automated post on his Facebook page claimed Arabs \u201cwant to annihilate us all.\u201d\n\nArab leaders accused Netanyahu of racism and trying to intimidate voters to stay home on election day.\n\nThe strategy appeared to backfire on many counts. The latest election returns showed a drop of support for Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party compared to April\u2019s vote. The results indicated that former Likud voters had migrated to other Jewish parties, including to Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beitenu, which nearly doubled its representation.\n\n\u201cHe took the polarization one step too far, and I think he\u2019s going to pay the price for it,\u201d said Aron Shaviv, a campaign strategist who managed Netanyahu\u2019s re-election campaign in 2015.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

The Joint List, an alliance of Arab factions, gained at least two seats and is now poised to be a major player in the next parliament, according to the near-final results.\n\n\u201cIncitement has a price,\u201d said Ayman Odeh, leader of the list.\n\nYohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, said the attacks on the country\u2019s democratic institutions were too much for many Israelis.\n\n\u201cIt created a sense of urgency that these professional institutions of state are being undermined,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic fatigue with his leadership may have added to his woes.\n\nMany Israelis have grown weary of Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, and their oldest son, Yair, who have gained a reputation of behaving more like a royal family than public servants. They have been embroiled in repeated scandals in which they allegedly mistreated employees, misused state funds or misbehaved in public.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, Netanyahu continued his attacks on Arab politicians and vowed to lead the country. \u201cThere are only two options: either a government led by me, or a dangerous government that leans on the Arab parties,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he had appointed a close Likud ally, Cabinet Minister Yariv Levin, to coordinate efforts with right-wing and religious partners.\n\nLikud lawmakers remained firmly behind their leader, but his leverage is limited. Without Lieberman, who refuses to sit in a government with religious parties, Netanyahu\u2019s allies cannot muster a majority.\n\nThe Blue and White party headed by Gantz, a former military chief of staff, has ruled out a partnership with Likud if Netanyahu stays at the helm. And even if he manages to stay in office, he would not have immunity if charges are filed against him. If that happens, as is widely expected, he could be forced to step aside.\n\nIn a reflection of his predicament, officials in Netanyahu\u2019s office announced that he had called off a planned visit to New York, where he was scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly and meet with Trump. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending an official announcement.\n\nA lukewarm statement by Trump provided little support for the embattled leader. \u201cOur relationship is with Israel,\u201d he said in California. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nBen Caspit, a columnist for the Maariv daily, said Netanyahu\u2019s chances of returning as prime minister are low.\n\n\u201cHe has nothing that he can leverage. He has no one to exert pressure on. There are simply no more rabbits left in his hat,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll blame the entire world, but he has only himself (and his wife) to blame. This phenomenally talented man became addicted to power and rotted from the inside out.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Benny Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White party captured 33 seats in the 120-seat parliament, to 32 seats for Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fa/2f/b9c913974eb5903e7b16c9f28215/190918-netanyahu-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
