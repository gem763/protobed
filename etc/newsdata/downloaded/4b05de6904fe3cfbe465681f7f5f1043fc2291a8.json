The Conservatives kicked out Cameron Ogilvie for discriminatory social media posts. The NDP booted Dock Currie because of online posts. The Greens have been forced to re-vet candidates after anti-abortion comments came to light, leader Elizabeth May said. And the PPC expelled a candidate after he asked leader Maxime Bernier to denounce racism.\n\nBreaking it down\n\nThe NDP had a slow start to their nominations process, with several dozen candidates missing as the campaign started. Meanwhile the Conservatives and PPC have had almost a full slate since kickoff day at the beginning of September.\n\nConservatives say 107 of their candidates are women \u2014 a record for the party.\n\nThe NDP provided a full demographic breakdown of their candidates. Almost half of their candidates \u2014 49 per cent (166), are female, while 24 per cent (80) are racialized, 12 per cent (40) are from the LGBTQ2 community, 12 per cent (39) are youth candidates, eight per cent (27) are Indigenous and five per cent (17) are living with a disability.\n\nThe Green Party said 46 per cent (156) of their candidates are women and four non-binary, five per cent (18) are racialized, four per cent (12) indigenous, and eight per cent (28) from the LGBTQ2 community.\n\nAmong the requirements to be eligible to run, a person must be 18, a Canadian citizen and have collected the names, addresses, and signatures of at least 100 qualified electors.\n\nA candidate can still withdraw his or her nomination by 5 p.m. local time on Sept. 30. But they must personally file a written statement of withdrawal with the returning officer, sign it and have it witnessed by two qualified electors, according to Elections Canada.", "description": "Almost all of the federal political parties have a full slate of candidates, but today is their last chance to make any changes.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302288.1569799766!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-writs-20190920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
