Moreover, more than 70% of affluent millennials and Gen-Xers have invested for impact.\n\nWhile knowledge of impact investing by advisors appears to lag behind their clients, Sarah Gelfand, vice president for social impact programs at Fidelity Charitable, still is encouraged that just over half of the advisors surveyed know what impact investing is. Moreover, 62% of advisors surveyed who have more than $100 million under management believe they know the topic well.\n\nAnecdotally, \u201cthat\u2019s a big change from 2009,\u201d Gelfand says.\n\nFidelity Charitable is an independent nonprofit related to, but independent of, Fidelity Investments, with about $26.9 billion in donor-advised fund (DAF) accounts as of June 30, 2018, the latest audited data available.\n\nDAFs are investment vehicles that can be set up by individuals with a tax-deductible, irrevocable grant. Over time, the assets in these vehicles are distributed to qualified charities.\n\nBut investors also have the option of directing their DAF assets to impact investments while they remain in the fund, and increasingly, millennial and Gen-X individuals in Fidelity Charitable\u2019s DAF accounts are inclined to do so.\n\nImpact investments in Fidelity Charitable\u2019s DAF accounts rose 16% to $936 million at the end of last year from $806 million a year before. Today, the nonprofit has more than $1 billion in impact investment assets, Gelfand says. The nonprofit defines impact investing broadly to include both public and private investments intended to create a social or environmental good.\n\nLast year, Fidelity Charitable made more impact investing options available to investors, adding three mutual fund approaches to a previously available \u201csustainable U.S. index asset pool\u201d managed by the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Equity fund (ticker: TISCX).\n\nThe nonprofit\u2019s donors also can invest DAF assets into recoverable grants\u2014loans to nonprofits that can fund research and development, for example, or perhaps that offer bridge financing for a project. As recoverable grants, impact investing becomes another strategy for individuals seeking to be effective philanthropists.\n\n\u201cImpact investing is increasingly seen as part of the toolbox\u201d of charitable giving, Gelfand says.\n\nThat\u2019s important because 56% of advisors expect clients who are interested in philanthropy will be open to a conversation about impact investing, and in fact 79% of individuals who invest for impact also view charitable giving as \u201cvery important,\u201d Fidelity Charitable has found.\n\nFinancial advisors who don\u2019t bring up impact investing options are \u201cleaving opportunities on the table to better engage clients,\u201d Gelfand says, particularly millennials.", "description": "A Fidelity Charitable study finds just over half of advisors understand the strategy well", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-108176/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
