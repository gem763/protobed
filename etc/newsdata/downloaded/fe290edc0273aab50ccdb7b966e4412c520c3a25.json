This means Labour, other opposition parties and Tory rebels are free to bring a bill in later aimed at preventing Boris Johnson from allowing the the UK to leave the EU on 31 October, unless MPs have backed any new deal with Brussels (should one be reached) or leaving without a deal.\n\nFor his part, the prime minister said the current position would not allow him to negotiate with EU leaders. He added that he would put down a motion calling for a snap general election. The BBC believes the probable date for this is 15 October - a Tuesday.\n\nTwenty-one Tory MPs - profiled here - rebelled against the government, despite warnings they would lose the Conservative whip, effectively meaning they could not run for the party at the next election.\n\nTo make the situation more complex, Mr Johnson needs two-thirds of MPs to back an election or it can't happen. Unless, that is, a different mechanism can be used.\n\nAmid impassioned scenes, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas criticised Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg over his body language.\n\nHere are five other things that happened on Tuesday.\n\nLooking ahead, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg describes how the defeat mighty actually help the PM.\n\nOur live page team will keep you up-to-date with all the latest developments throughout the day, and if you need to take a step back from the drama, try our guide to Brexit.\n\nHurricane Dorian death toll rises\n\nThe prime minister of the Bahamas says there are likely to be more deaths, after the number of people killed by Hurricane Dorian rose to seven.

This is believed to be the biggest such haul in UK history, the drug having a street value of \u00a3120m. The heroin was hidden in towels and bathrobes.

The cassava root will otherwise release hydrogen cyanide. What makes cassava particularly treacherous is that some processing will reduce the bitter taste and the risk of immediate cyanide poisoning.\n\nHowever, only the full, time-consuming ritual can guarantee that you will not be slowly poisoned, and develop a condition called Konzo, with symptoms including sudden paralysis of the legs. But in 1981, in Nampula in Mozambique, a young Swedish doctor knew none of this. As a result, the situation he faced was deeply puzzling.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\n\"Over to you, Britain\" is the Sun's headline, as the papers react to Boris Johnson's Commons defeat over Brexit and the prospect of an election next month. \"Johnson loses control,\" says the i, while the Daily Express calls MPs' behaviour \"shameful\" and a \"surrender\" to the EU.
