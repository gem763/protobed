It looked vaguely like him but was mostly a ridiculous caricature. The guy was a little stinker! His preferred outfit was this red, Adidas-esque tracksuit and a little black fedora\u2014two clothing items the human version of my boyfriend didn\u2019t actually own. And he was always doing the most ridiculous shit, like spewing coffee from his tiny mouth or exploding an anatomically correct heart right out of his chest to connote love. He was just crazy like that; a real wild card.\n\nI didn\u2019t think the stupid Bitmoji, who I always found very charming, would ever make me cry. A few days after my boyfriend and I broke up, his devilish little face popped up on my phone screen after I accidentally tapped into the Bitmoji keyboard while typing a text to a friend. A jolt went through my brain. At some point during our relationship, I\u2019d used a feature in the Bitmoji app that lets you pair two cartoon people together (called, quite wholesomely, \u201cFriendmoji\u201d). There were our little avatars, blowing exaggerated kisses to each other, cheersing foamy beers, and generally having a ball together, completely unaware that their real-life counterparts no longer did any of those things. I frantically closed the texting app, embarassed by how owned I felt by a cartoon I created.\n\nThat was just the first in a series of depraved surprises I found lurking in my phone in the weeks after our breakup. I thought I\u2019d taken all the proper steps to protect myself from any digital surprises: in the raw, immediate aftermath of our split, I\u2019d removed him from my phone\u2019s \u201cfavorites\u201d list and buried our text thread underneath a bunch of other messages. Historically, this has been enough to cleanse my phone of any painful artifacts. (The only other thing I might have previously done is unfollow him on Twitter and Instagram, but I\u2019d ultimately decided against that in this case.) I didn\u2019t realize how tangled up our lives had become, and how much of our relationship was pumped into my phone, until the time came to do all the untangling.\n\nHere\u2019s the still-developing list of things I\u2019ve had to do in the time since our breakup: Unfriend him on the Pattern, which kept serving me notifications about his emotional state according to the stars or some shit; delete our shared Google Calendar; delete the perpetual event I had in my phone calendar for his birthday (and tell my mom to delete it from hers, too); mute his Instagram Stories from my feed; and, of course, break up our oblivious Bitmojis, which honestly felt kinda cruel. It\u2019s not their fault their creators couldn\u2019t keep it together; I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve been happy to keep canoodling and fucking around together within the app for a lot longer.\n\nWhen did it get this fucking hard to wipe a relationship from your phone? My first breakup with an iPhone was in college, in 2011. I don\u2019t remember having to do much to cleanse my phone of the relationship; I mostly just remember shoving all physical reminders of him into an extremely cursed box that now lives underneath a bed in my mom\u2019s house. Subsequent breakups got slightly more complicated. Later in college, I blocked a phone number for the first time and had a friend hide all photos we had together in an iCloud album I couldn\u2019t access and cry over. Breakups in adulthood have kinda stayed on this level; I can\u2019t tell if this is a testament to my aversion to Really Letting People In :), or a testament to how much an extension of my body my phone\u2019s become in the past two years. Probably it\u2019s a little bit of both.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of fuss about how Millennials are delaying a bunch of sacred relationship steps. Research shows that my cohort gets married later; dates more discerningly than previous generations; and doesn\u2019t cohabitate until shit is extremely real. My ex and I never made it to the living together phase\u2014something I imagine is logistical and emotional hell to sort out after a breakup\u2014but our lives were becoming increasingly entwined on our phones, like we were beta-testing what it might be like if we shared a life in a more substantial way.\n\nI keep finding evidence of how connected we were; I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll reach the end of it. Each little thing I discover brings back specific memories of times in which I was so sure and happy, I didn\u2019t think twice about the potential for future pain. My phone, of course, doesn\u2019t understand the emotional gravity of what it\u2019s doing. (.........Or does it?)\n\nPart of me is sick of having to intentionally go into my stupid apps and alert them to my breakup. It\u2019s, frankly, very fucked up to have to tell an astrology app that your relationship has failed. But another part of me is scared to hit the inevitable end of the digital traces of our relationship. Each thing reminds me of time I felt so optimistic about our future that I wasn\u2019t even considering the end. That\u2019s a nice way to feel about someone.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Hannah Smothers on Twitter.", "description": "The list of things I've had to do to scrub my relationship from my phone is long and depraved.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da8c6f69794ac00099ebf51/lede/1571344689532-Untitled-design-2.png?crop=1xw:0.9204545454545454xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
