This is what they were refused,\u201d the cardinal said.\n\n\u201cI told the mayor of the city this is what the courage of the Gospel is about,\u201d said Krajewski. \u201cWe usually want to help the poor in the way we think is good for them. But they don\u2019t need musical concerts. They need to take a shower. They need to have a bank account.\u201d\n\nImmigration into Italy has experienced a resurgence under the nation\u2019s new leftist government, which has opened its ports, reversing efforts by former interior minister Matteo Salvini to curb illegal immigration.\n\nUnder Salvini\u2019s leadership, migrant sea deaths in the Mediterranean drastically declined as fewer prospective migrants attempted the perilous journey.\n\nMr. Salvini has slammed the unelected reigning coalition government for reigniting the nation\u2019s migrant crisis by reopening borders to migrants and foreign NGOs.\n\nIn a tweet, the leader of the Lega party recently noted the \u201c2,498 arrivals in September compared with 947 in the same month a year ago,\u201d while observing that in mid-October \u201clandings have already exceeded 700, compared with the 1,007 for the entire October 2018.\u201d\n\nThe spike in new migrant arrivals has also produced a significant uptick in migrant deaths, Mr. Salvini has observed, a phenomenon the pro-immigration forces supposedly detest.\n\nMr. Salvini blamed the leftist government\u2019s new open-ports policy for the 13 who died off the coast of Lampedusa earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThese deaths are the results of do-gooders, of \u2018there is room for everyone,\u2019 of open ports, of renewed enthusiasm for the smugglers,\u201d Salvini said.\n\nDuring his tenure in government, Salvini was quite literally demonized by the Catholic establishment in Italy, who called him everything from the Antichrist to Satan for his resistance to open borders.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Mayor of an Italian town has signed an agreement with the local bishop granting every Catholic parish the power to register migrants.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
