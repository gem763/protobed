Trucks could initially have to wait up to two and a half days to cross the English Channel.\n\n\u201cCertain types of fresh food supply will decrease,\u201d it said. \u201cThere is a risk that panic buying will cause or exacerbate food supply disruption.... Protests and counter-protests will take place across the UK.\u201d\n\nJohnson says Britain will leave on time, with or without a deal. Opposition lawmakers who seized the parliamentary agenda last week have passed a law ordering him to seek a delay unless he agrees a deal with the EU to head off chaos.\n\nParliament has since been suspended, with courts giving divided rulings about whether Johnson had the right to do so. Johnson says he wants an urgent general election to resolve the impasse. His opponents say they will let him call an election only once the threat of a no-deal exit is taken off the table.\n\nThe government said the Operation Yellowhammer document published on Wednesday revealed a worst-case scenario only, and that it had to prepare for all contingencies. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for no-deal preparations, said the assumptions in the five-page document were being reviewed.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party said the documents confirmed the severe risks of a no-deal Brexit, and demanded that the suspended parliament be recalled \u201cto scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal\u201d.\n\nVehicles pass beneath a sign warning of possible changes to freight procedures following Brexit on the M56 motorway near Chester, Britain, September 12, 2019.

The worst disruption could last for up to three months.\n\nTraffic queues could affect fuel deliveries, disrupting supplies in London and south-east England, and panic buying could cause shortages in other parts of the country, it said.\n\nCross-border financial services would be affected as would information-sharing between police and security services.\n\nIn releasing the document, Gove was acceding to a request from lawmakers. He refused a separate request to make public the advice of government advisers about the suspension of parliament.\n\nA Scottish court ruled on Wednesday that the suspension was unlawful, prompting calls for lawmakers to return to work. A separate court in England has ruled that judges do not have the power to question Johnson\u2019s decision. The cases go to the Supreme Court for a final ruling next week.\n\nLeaving the EU with a deal would allow Britain to maintain its existing trading relationship during a transition period while it hammers out a new relationship with the bloc.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nWithout such a deal, opponents say, the world\u2019s fifth largest economy would become subject to an array of trade restrictions with a suddenness that has no precedent.\n\nSupporters say there may be some disruption but it would not be too severe, and Britain would benefit in the longer term.", "description": "A 'no-deal' Brexit could snarl cross-Channel trade routes, disrupting supplies of medicines and fresh food while protests spread across Britain, according to a worst-case scenario reluctantly released by the government on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429009704&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0KQ", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
