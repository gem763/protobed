She was 34.\n\nShe was slain on Oct. 12 along with a driver and aide when Turkey-backed fighters stopped their SUV on the M4 highway in northern Syria, according to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and officials in her party.\n\nThe spokesman for the Turkey-backed Syrian rebel force, the National Army, at the time denied its fighters killed her, saying they had not advanced as far as the M4.\n\nLast week, the spokesman, Youssef Hammoud, said the incident was being investigated among other \"breaches\".\n\n\"If America hadn't decided to withdraw, these factions ... would not have dared to carry out their operations in that area,\" said Moaz Abdul Karim, a Future Syria Party leader.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has said it was looking into reports of Khalaf's death apparently while in the hands of Turkey-backed forces, calling the reports \"extremely troubling\".\n\nAn autopsy report circulated by the SDF said Khalaf's body had been riddled with bullets.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAN ASSURANCES\n\nOn Oct. 3, U.S. State Department representatives visited the Future Syria Party's headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and told Khalaf and party president Ibrahim al-Kaftan that American efforts in the region were aimed at mediation.\n\nSince the party was founded in 2018, its leaders say U.S. officials have voiced their support. The party aims to attract members from across the ethnic spectrum in a region where critics said the Kurdish YPG militia had become too powerful.\n\n\"Yes, there was encouragement from the Americans to set up a party,\" Kaftan said.\n\n\"The party was already being worked on by a team who believes in Syrian democracy. It was a Syrian idea, not an American one, but I repeat they were in favour of this idea,\" he told Reuters in written answers to questions.\n\nU.S. forces withdrew from a section of the border on Oct. 7, and soon afterwards Turkish troops mounted their third incursion into northern Syria since 2016.\n\nAnkara views the YPG as a terrorist threat due to their links to a Kurdish insurgency at home. It has also said its operation in Syria was designed to create a buffer where some of the 3.6 million refugees who fled the Syrian conflict into Turkey could be re-settled.\n\n\n\n\n\nDEEPLY INVOLVED\n\nA civil engineer by training, Khalaf was deeply involved in the politics of northeast Syria from the earliest days of the war, now in its eighth year.\n\nAfter leaving her job as a state employee, she helped to set up the Kurdish-led administration whose influence would eventually stretch over one third of Syria including predominantly Arab areas.\n\nIn 2018, she was elected secretary general of the Future Syria Party, which was launched from Raqqa, a predominantly Arab city where the SDF defeated IS in 2017 with U.S. backing.\n\nKaftan, an Arab architect from Manbij, was elected its leader, and he said that U.S. and French officials attended the ceremony.\n\nThe United States has long adopted a cautious political approach towards northern Syria, even as it backed the SDF militarily in the fight against IS.", "description": "Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf spent the final months of her life building a political party that she hoped would help shape Syria's future, drawing the attention of U.S. officials who said it would have a say in what happened once the war ended.
