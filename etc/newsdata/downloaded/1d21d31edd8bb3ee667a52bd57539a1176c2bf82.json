At least one member of GOP leadership \u2014 retiring Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan \u2014 has decided to back a primary opponent to hard-line conservative Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who was kicked off his committees for making racist remarks earlier this year.\n\nKing\u2019s comments \u201creflect negatively upon Republicans and, as a result, I will contribute to his primary opponent,\u201d Mitchell, the sophomore class representative, said in a statement.\n\nMitchell\u2019s stance underscores a broader feeling in the GOP conference, where many Republicans would be relieved to see fresh faces with less baggage emerge victorious in some of these primary races. Otherwise, the GOP will continue to take the reputational hit that comes with these lawmakers serving in office \u2014 or worse, the party could lose those seats in the general election.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
