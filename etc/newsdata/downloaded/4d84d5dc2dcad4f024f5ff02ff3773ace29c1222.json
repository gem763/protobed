The president's attorneys have argued he has blanket immunity from criminal prosecution and even investigation while in office.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAttorneys and the three appeals court judges, all of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents, frequently referred to Trump\u2019s assertion from his 2016 presidential campaign that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone\u201d without losing supporters.\n\nJudge Denny Chin asked Consovoy how such a scenario would work under the president\u2019s claims of executive immunity from prosecution and investigation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your view on the \u2018Fifth Avenue\u2019 example?\u201d Chin asked. \u201cLocal authorities couldn\u2019t investigate, couldn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing could be done, that\u2019s your position?\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Consovoy responded.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office has accused Trump of making up privilege claims about his tax returns and other financial records amid a legal battle that seems destined for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe case stems from a subpoena that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance issued to the accounting firm Mazars seeking the same financial records that are at the heart of separate court battles involving two Democratic-controlled House committees.\n\nCarey Dunne, a lawyer with the Manhattan District Attorney's office, pushed back aggressively against arguments that Trump's records were protected under the constitution.\n\n\u201cThere is no privilege for tax returns, whether it's the president or anybody else in the country,\u201d Dunne told the judges. \u201cYes, he may view them as embarrassing or sensitive. But yes, tax returns do in fact get subpoenaed all the time in financial investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're making this up, your honor, that's all I can say,\u201d Dunne added.\n\nThe judges appeared skeptical of the president's broad claims that he has a blanket immunity from criminal prosecution and even investigation while in office.\n\nThe case has indeed progressed more rapidly than Trump\u2019s legal battles with Congress. The House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s effort to obtain the president\u2019s federal tax returns is still unfolding in the D.C. District Court, as is the president\u2019s lawsuit against members of Congress and New York officials over a recent state law allowing Congress to obtain the president\u2019s returns.\n\nEarlier this month, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the House Oversight Committee\u2019s effort to subpoena Mazars in another case that could reach the Supreme Court.\n\nVance and Trump's lawyers have agreed to expedite their case in an effort to fast-track it to the Supreme Court. Vance said that his office would not enforce the subpoena while the legal battle plays out.\n\nRobert Katzmann, the chief judge for the Second Circuit, acknowledged that the fight will likely move to the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\n\u201cThis case seems bound for the Supreme Court,\u201d Katzmann said.\n\n\u201cI think both sides see that as an inevitability, your honor,\u201d Dunne responded.", "description": "An attorney for President Trump told a federal appeals court Wednesday that Trump could not be prosecuted even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101119getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
