Years ago it would just be because a player is out of form, these days it could be a number of things that are wrong.\n\nFootball has a duty of care, and the game needs to take responsibility for that.\n\n* Ian Holloway is a pundit on EFL on Quest throughout the season.

It is very, very harsh, but that is football. That's the way it is.\n\n(Image: Quest)\n\n* The EFL's 'Goals Worth Talking about' aims to use the power of football to encourage conversation about our mental health.\n\nTo find out more about the EFL and Mind's campaign visit: https://www.efl.com/onyourside", "description": "In this week's column, EFL on Quest pundit Ian Holloway discusses mental health problems in football", "authors": ["Ian Holloway", "Image", "Efl", "Quest"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551477.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LCP_CHP_101019HollowayEFL_2687HollowayEFLJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
