And that translates to big opportunities for both investors and primary home seekers.\n\nIn New York, where listing inventory was up 8.2% in the second quarter of 2019, buyers have options galore, and developers are touting unique amenities to stand out in a crowded market. In Los Angeles, the market has rebounded after a sluggish start to the year, with international investors increasingly making moves in the west coast city. And just as is the case in New York, in L.A., buyers are craving ultra-modern and unique amenities.\n\nIn London, meanwhile, uncertainty in both politics and in the real estate market persists. As such, the value of the pound has dropped and buyers remain tentative. Despite many recently launched developments struggling to sell out, a number of new luxury apartments are hitting the market, including marquee projects such as 1 Palace Street near Buckingham Palace, and Belvedere Gardens, the last complex to launch sales as part of Southbank Place, a large-scale development.\n\nIn Dubai, prices continue to fall, creating a golden opportunity for investors to snag a flashy new home in developments like One Park Avenue\u2014which is in one of the city\u2019s most sought-after districts, Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum City\u2014and Sur La Mer ,the first freehold townhouse community located in the sought-after Jumeirah 1 district.\n\nLet Mansion Global guide you through what new developments are in store in each of these top markets, as well as in Miami, San Francisco and Sydney, Australia.", "description": "Mansion Global\u2019s inside look at top sales launching around the world", "authors": ["Mansion Global Staff"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-111655?size=1.8285714285714285&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
