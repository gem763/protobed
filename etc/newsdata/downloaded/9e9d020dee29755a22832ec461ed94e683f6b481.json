The big question is whether Labour will be dragged into one against their will, or not.", "description": "The Liberal Democrats plan to bring forward a piece of legislation which would allow the prime minister to secure a general election in 2019.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db6dbc6dee0192fa5375734?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
