(Nasdaq: WWR), an energy materials development company, announced today that it has taken delivery of the first shipment of natural flake graphite concentrate pursuant to its recently announced long-term graphite purchase agreement. The entirety of the 20 metric tonnes of material received will be used in development of planned pilot scale processes and to produce several metric tonnes of battery ready advanced graphite products which include ULTRA-PMGTM, ULTRA-DEXDGTM and ULTRA-CSPGTM. Various sizes of each of the Company\u2019s three planned products will be distributed to potential clients to advance the pre-qualification process.\n\nChristopher M. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \u201cWith this delivery, we can now go about the business of executing our pilot plant studies and putting larger samples of battery graphite in the hands of battery manufacturers. This is an important milestone.\u201d\n\nAbout Westwater Resources\n\nWWR is focused on developing energy-related materials. The Company\u2019s battery-materials projects include the Coosa Graphite Project \u2014 the most advanced natural flake graphite project in the contiguous United States \u2014 and the associated Coosa Graphite Mine located across 41,900 acres (~17,000 hectares) in east-central Alabama. In addition, the Company maintains lithium mineral properties in two prospective lithium brine basins in Nevada and Utah. Westwater\u2019s uranium projects are located in Texas and New Mexico. In Texas, the Company has two licensed and currently idled uranium processing facilities and approximately 11,000 acres (~4,400 hectares) of prospective in-situ recovery uranium projects. In New Mexico, the Company controls mineral rights encompassing approximately 188,700 acres (~76,000 hectares) in the prolific Grants Mineral Belt, which is one of the largest concentrations of sandstone-hosted uranium deposits in the world. Incorporated in 1977 as Uranium Resources, Inc., Westwater also owns an extensive uranium information database of historic drill hole logs, assay certificates, maps and technical reports for the western United States.

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are identified by words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d and other similar words. All statements addressing events or developments that WWR expects or anticipates will occur in the future, including but not limited to statements relating to the planned startup of and production from the Coosa Graphite Processing Facility and any future production of graphite feedstock from the Coosa Graphite Mine, are forward-looking statements. Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in light of important risk factors and uncertainties. These risk factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, (a) the Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement the Coosa Graphite Project business plan including elements associated with the planned pilot plant and its processes, and the risk that additional analysis of the Coosa Graphite Project may result in revisions to that business plan; (b) the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital in the future; (c) spot price and long-term contract price of graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium; (d) risks associated with our domestic operations; (e) operating conditions at the Company\u2019s projects; (f) government and tribal regulation of the graphite industry, the lithium industry, the vanadium industry, the uranium industry, and the power industry; (g) world-wide graphite, lithium, vanadium and uranium supply and demand, including the supply and demand for lithium-based batteries; (h) maintaining sufficient financial assurance in the form of sufficiently collateralized surety instruments; (i) unanticipated geological, processing, regulatory and legal or other problems the Company may encounter in the jurisdictions where the Company operates or intends to operate, including in Alabama, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada; (j) the ability of the Company to enter into and successfully close acquisitions or other material transactions; (k) the results of the Company\u2019s lithium brine exploration activities at the Columbus Basin and Sal Rica projects, and the possibility that future exploration results may be materially less promising than initial exploration result; (I) any graphite, lithium, vanadium or uranium discoveries not being in high-enough concentration to make it economic to extract the metals; (m) currently pending or new litigation or arbitration; and (n) other factors which are more fully described in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should any of the Company\u2019s underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those currently anticipated. In addition, undue reliance should not be placed on the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, the Company disclaims any obligation to update or publicly announce any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this news release. The results of the initial optimization study are preliminary in nature and subject to revision following WWR\u2019s further analysis of the Coosa Graphite Project.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191015005263/en/\n\nContacts\n\nWestwater Resources Contact:\n\nChristopher M.
