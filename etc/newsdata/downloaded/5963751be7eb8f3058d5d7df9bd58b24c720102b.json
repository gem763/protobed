lowest business investment growth of any country in the elite G7 group.\n\nCrucially, even a Brexit deal, now increasingly unlikely with the EU poised to reject Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals, would deliver \u201cweak\u201d growth at around 1.5 per cent a year.\n\n\u201cRemaining in the EU would be best for growth,\u201d the study concludes \u2013 although the benefit could be wiped out by Labour\u2019s plans to hike tax, nationalise industries and tighten labour market regulation, it argues.\n\nThe economic damage from the Brexit vote \u2013 even before the UK actually leaves the EU \u2013 is the result of the plunging pound squeezing household incomes and uncertainty hitting investment.\n\nThe new assessment will strengthen criticism that the pre-referendum warnings of the consequences, branded \u2018Project Fear\u2019 by Brexit supporters, in fact reflect the reality of what has happened.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond
