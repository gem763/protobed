Please refresh for updates.\n\nThe gunman who killed two people near a synagogue in Halle, Germany, on Wednesday appears to have filmed his attack, and the footage was uploaded to Twitch, a platform popular with video game users.\n\nThe video shows the alleged suspect, a young white male, driving to his chosen location, alone. He speaks to a camera, positioned on the passenger seat, and says, in English, \u201cHi, my name is Anon,\u201d using a name that 4chan and 8chan users often call themselves. \u201cI think the Holocaust never happened.\u201d\n\nThe gunman goes on to spout anti-Semitic and white nationalist conspiracy theories, including blaming feminism for the \u201cdecline of birth rates in the West.\u201d\n\nGerman authorities announced Wednesday they\u2019re investigating the possibility that the attack was ideologically motivated by far-right extremism but have yet to confirm a motive. Police have arrested one suspect, but it\u2019s not clear whether they arrested the person who recorded the video. Police also believe other suspects could be involved, and a manhunt is still underway. Law enforcement in Halle referred VICE News inquiries to Germany\u2019s federal prosecution office, which did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe link to the video, viewed by VICE News, has been taken down, a Twitch spokesperson confirmed. The platform is still working to figure out how long the video was online or if it was copied.\n\n\u201cTwitch has a zero-tolerance policy against hateful conduct, and any act of violence is taken extremely seriously,\u201d Brielle Villablanca, head of corporate communications at Twitch, told VICE News. \u201cWe are working with urgency to permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act.\u201d\n\nThe video shows the gunman, upon arriving in Halle, opening the backseat of his car which contains a large number of various weapons. He puts on a helmet, which has a recording device attached to it and picks up a rifle.\n\nThe stream from the camera mounted on his helmet shows him attempting to enter the synagogue, where 70 to 80 people had gathered for Yom Kippur services, but the door is locked. He shoots at the door, but it doesn\u2019t give. He opens fire on a woman passing by, then tries another entrance, but fails and goes back to his car.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t shoot,\u201d he says in English. \u201cI tried to kill some ... [inaudible] Like the loser I am. Fuck.\u201d\n\nHe pulls over and heads toward a kebab shop, where he opens fire. One person appears to fall to the ground. The gunman then goes back to his car and drives away.\n\nBy recording the video, the gunman appears to be emulating the white nationalist who opened fire on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in mid-March and live-streamed the deadly attack on Facebook. Videos of these attacks, or written manifestos, contribute to a growing canon of violent far-right propaganda that extremists use to inspire future attacks.\n\nA link to the stream was shared quickly across far-right Telegram channels, where users had already claimed the gunman as a \u201csaint\u201d \u2014 a title reserved for far-right domestic terrorists who have carried out attacks in the past.\n\nJoseph Cox contributed to this report.\n\nCover image: Police officers secure a synagogue in Dresden, Germany, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019.
