The newly born Republic of Gilead, with its abuses and abominations, its hideously misogynistic vocabulary and gruesomely rationalised constraints, was just about far enough from our own world to seem beguiling, but also close enough to feel like a wake-up call.\n\nStill, no one could have guessed the extent to which recent history (as well as a superb TV offshoot) would bring it eerily, terrifyingly back into focus. With the implacable rise of the Christian right in the US, never has it felt more urgent for women to guard both their bodies and their reproductive systems against (some) men and the state. Who, after all, is Donald Trump if not Commander Waterford without the charm? And I can\u2019t be the only one who, watching the Trump crowd\u2019s chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d or \u201cSend her back!\u201d, found herself thinking of taser-wielding Aunt Lydia and the handmaids\u2019 cries of \u201cHer fault!\u201d when one of their number \u201cconfesses\u201d to having been gang-raped?\n\nGiven all of this history \u2013 and the fact that for 35 years fans have apparently been begging for answers to a host of Gilead-related questions \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that The Testaments feels as eagerly awaited as a handmaid\u2019s bouncing baby. If ever a novelist could justify the spawning of a sequel, Atwood can.\n\nThis novel opens 15 years after the end of the last book. Perhaps wisely, Atwood neatly leapfrogs the TV series \u2013 presumably leaving it open for several more seasons \u2013 while plucking just one significant detail from it: Baby Nicole. The \u201cchild\u201d of Commander Waterford and his wife (though in fact, as we all know, born of Offred/June and fathered by her lover, Nick), Nicole was smuggled into Canada as a baby and has not been seen since.\n\nThis \u2013 together with the constant \u201cseepage\u201d of handmaids being helped to freedom by the so-called Underground Femaleroad \u2013 has not been good for Gilead, which has settled into an inevitable \u201cdog-eat-dog maturity\u201d. Meanwhile, a great deal of effort and espionage are going into tracking down missing Baby Nicole \u2013 now seen as the veritable \u201cposter child for Gilead\u201d \u2013 so that the republic can reclaim her as their own.\n\nThe novel is narrated by three different female voices. The first belongs to Aunt Lydia herself, who is secretly writing her memoirs, apparently largely \u201cfor your edification, my unknown reader\u201d. The second is Agnes, a young woman who has grown up in Gilead and is being groomed (in both senses of the word) to marry a commander. The third, Daisy, is a feisty teenager living in Canada with two people who run a thrift store and whom she supposes to be her parents, except that something has always felt wrong: \u201cIt was like I was a prize cat they were cat-sitting.\u201d\n\nHow these young women may or may not be connected \u2013 to one another and also, in Daisy\u2019s case, to Gilead \u2013 is one of the questions that drives the first hundred pages or so of the novel. Certainly, right from the start, Daisy lets slip that she discovered on her birthday that she was a \u201cfraud \u2013 a forgery done on purpose\u201d. And Agnes, who used to think she remembered nothing before the age of six or seven, realises she does have one \u201chazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand\u201d. Aunt Lydia, meanwhile, who is \u201ceverywhere and nowhere\u201d, knows everything that they (and we) don\u2019t know. Atwood has always said that \u201cknowledge is power\u201d, but will Aunt Lydia use her power for good or evil?\n\nAtwood challenges us to think and rethink, to see our volatile world anew\n\nWhat follows is a plump, pacy, witty and tightly plotted page-turner that transports us straight back to the dark heart of Gilead and seems to take great pleasure in providing answers to many of Atwood\u2019s readers\u2019 questions. If, for instance, you ever wondered why Aunt Lydia seems so willing to join the regime\u2019s monstrous attack on her own gender (despite a queasily hinted at softer side), here\u2019s her backstory. Similarly, the inner workings of Gilead are exposed in far more detail than in the first book and it\u2019s hardly surprising to learn that \u201cbeneath its outer show of virtue and purity\u201d the place is \u201crotting\u201d.\n\nWhat is surprising, though, given that so many of Atwood\u2019s actual details remain so gloriously dark (a paedophile dentist whose hand sits on a pubescent child\u2019s breast \u201clike a large hot crab\u201d is an image that won\u2019t leave me in a hurry), is that the story\u2019s outcomes are anything but. Perhaps Atwood has simply decided that Gilead\u2019s time is up \u2013 or maybe she\u2019s grown too fond of her characters to deny them happiness \u2013 but in so many startling ways this novel feels like a straight antidote to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\n\nMargaret Atwood: \u2018She\u2019s ahead of everyone in the room\u2019 Read more\n\nWhere the first book traded so pithily and memorably in obfuscation, despair and darkness, the sequel sees the lamps slowly lit. Where, at the end of the first, June was bundled into the back of a van with no idea whether it heralded her \u201cend\u201d or her \u201cbeginning\u201d, in this second novel we have a quasi-Shakespearean sense of all\u2019s well that ends well. Not only do various bad guys receive their comeuppance, but there\u2019s a strong sense of goodness winning the day, even \u2013 whisper it \u2013 hints of something that might amount to a happy ending.\n\nWhich actually feels a touch disappointing. Sure, this new book is gloriously savage in its anger, against both God, with his \u201cspecial interest\u201d in the \u201cpolluting\u201d blood that comes out of girls, and sexually predatory men who prefer their underage victims to seem \u201cnot fully human, with a naughty core to them\u201d. There is no doubt that Atwood is on top form here. But still it feels as if something crucial is missing.\n\nOr perhaps not missing enough, for didn\u2019t the strength of the first book lie precisely in its daring ambiguities, its unapologetic refusal to elucidate? Surely one of the reasons Gilead managed to be so spookily convincing was that Atwood cunningly chose to leave so many of its edges blurry. Interiors, furniture, food, clothes, linen were described with all of the deft shadow and gleam of a Dutch painting \u2013 and the same, incidentally, is true in this book \u2013 but beyond that, we only had the vaguest hints of how the larger world worked. The most trenchant and exciting fiction almost always amounts to an act of conjuring \u2013 and in Atwood\u2019s gracefully necromantic hands, Gilead\u2019s regime didn\u2019t seem to require much explanation or justification. We believed, simple as that. And as for why Aunt Lydia behaves as she does? Well, have any of the world\u2019s most brutal regimes ever run short of compliant executioners?\n\nAnother problem, which becomes more troubling as the novel unfolds, is the lack of emotional subtext, or indeed sometimes any subtext at all. In The Testaments, what you see is what you get, with any possibility of equivocation, shading or real complexity (or the chance for readers to imagine anything for themselves) sacrificed again and again to pace and plot. Perhaps the emphatically retrospective nature of this narrative doesn\u2019t help. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale unfolded in a memorably deadpan and very immediate present tense \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what was coming next any more than June did. But here, because all three central characters are apparently giving their accounts as \u201cwitnesses\u201d, events unwind in the far less suspenseful and all-too hindsight-laden past.\n\nPerhaps because of this, there are few, if any, chances to feel moved on behalf of these characters \u2013 a strange and enervating absence in a novel that hinges so strongly on the agonies of familial separation. It made me wonder, not for the first time, whether this simply isn\u2019t where Atwood\u2019s interests lie: the only scene in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale that, on a recent rereading, seemed less than entirely convincing is when June, finally shown a photograph of her daughter and unable to find any trace of her own existence in her child\u2019s eyes, wishes she hadn\u2019t seen it at all. (Believe me, no mother on Earth would pass up on that photo.)\n\nWhere Atwood\u2019s interests do undeniably lie is in shaking us up, challenging our complacencies and using her chillingly profound imagination to challenge us to think and rethink, to see our volatile and increasingly toxic world anew. But is she willing to leave room for her reader? I have my own test of what makes a truly great work of fiction: can you revisit it at a later point in your life and read a whole different novel? In other words, is the novel sufficiently elastic \u2013 and slippery and enigmatic \u2013 to grow with you?\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale triumphantly passes this test. But occasionally, with its wide-angle sweep and wholehearted lack of uncertainty, its angels and demons struggle and seemingly effortless resolutions, The Testaments can feel as if it\u2019s already decided what it thinks. And what we should think, too.\n\nJulie Myerson\u2019s most recent novel is The Stopped Heart (Jonathan Cape).\n\n\u2022 The Testaments by Margaret Atwood is published by Chatto & Windus (\u00a320).
