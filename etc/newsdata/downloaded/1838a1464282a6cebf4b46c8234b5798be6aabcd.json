And I hope we answer all those questions satisfyingly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe mysteriously added that \u2018anything is possible\u2019 but reiterated that there was nothing more to add to his story arc.\n\nShaun Emery\u2019s tragic fate was inevitable in The Capture (Picture: BBC)\n\nAs for whether we will be getting a second series, Ben told Metro.co.uk that he couldn\u2019t \u2018confirm or deny\u2019 anything, but talks are happening behind-the-scenes.\n\nChannan went on to explain to us why Shaun\u2019s fate was sealed from the get-go, but Rachel\u2019s was a little more complicated.\n\n\u2018I knew that\u2019s how I was going to end it for Shaun,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018It had to be a sad ending. But there is a ray of hope \u2013 his ex is now talking to him, showing him pictures of her with the kid.\n\n\u2018Shaun doesn\u2019t care about other people; he cares about what his daughter thinks and his closest friends and relatives. He doesn\u2019t want his daughter thinking he\u2019s a murderer and he kidnapped her; Karen is going to make sure of that. So he gets that.\n\n\u2018I knew the system had to win. Shaun and Carey can\u2019t bring the system down \u2013 the system always wins.\u2019\n\nThe Capture is available on BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
