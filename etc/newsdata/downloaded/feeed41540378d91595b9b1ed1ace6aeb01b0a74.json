Et tu, Joe?\n\nYes, that liberal-press-labeled gentle sweetheart of a former vice president says institutional racism in the U.S. is \u201coverwhelmingly a white man\u2019s problem visited on people of color.\u201d\n\nWe who have actually fought in the trenches (metaphorically speaking) against discrimination against people of African heritage are sick of these scum tactics.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the hate-mongering by, yes, people of African as well as of Western European, Asian and Middle Eastern descent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many times we have to say that the president is racist and unfit to serve,\u201d tweeted House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat of African descent.\n\nRep. Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat who founded a chapter of the Black Panthers in the 1960s, insultingly addressed Mr. Trump with this tweet:\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you[?]\u201d\n\nMr. Rush can get away with such racist insolence and not be tagged as the racist that he is because he\u2019s not a Republican or a conservative.\n\nBut the Democrats in Congress and in the press would lynch any other American of any racial persuasion if he or she asked aloud: \u201cHow dare a member of the U.S. Congress address a president of the United States that way?\u201d\n\nIs the word \u201clynching\u201d a racially laden word?\n\nNo.\n\nNot anywhere.\n\nEspecially not in the United States, where our pioneers used it as an unjustifiable law-enforcement tactic before the rule of law reached the lawless West and brought elected or appointed law enforcers and magistrates.\n\nThe gentlemen unceremoniously strung from a tree were horse and cattle thieves and bank robbers mainly of the Caucasian persuasion and Western European heritage.\n\nEvery Democrat of European, African and Asian descent in the U.S. House and Senate has used a form of the word \u201clynch\u201d as a figure of speech.\n\nUsing it is like saying, \u201cButtigieg absolutely destroyed Beto in the fourth debate.\u201d\n\nHave Democrats turned the word \u201cracist\u201d and now \u201clynching\u201d into cudgels to crack the skulls of everyone from The Donald to local Republican politicians and for that matter anyone else to the right of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer?\n\nYes.\n\nThen why did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell join the Democrats\u2019 lynch mob?\n\nWhy did Mr. McConnell say it \u201cwas an unfortunate choice of words\u201d for Mr. Trump to call the impeachment investigation a lynching.\n\nBecause Mr. McConnell is and has always been nothing if not politically correct.\n\nBecause his expertise in the philosophy and policies of conservatism is most often rhetorical (and even then infrequent).\n\nThat and being up for reelection explain but do not justify Mr. McConnell\u2019s saying: \u201cGiven the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching.\u201d\n\nBut the Dems\u2019 secret-testimony impeachment investigation is comparable to lynching in the same way Mr. McConnell and virtually every other human being has at one time or another whipped out a metaphor or hyperbole to sharpen a point.\n\nThe racist bull began long before Mr. Trump said \u201clynching.\u201d It started when he had the temerity to announce for the GOP nomination.\n\nThe racist bullying by Dems of all racial inclinations was over the top then and now is over whatever that top was.\n\nHere is Mr. Schumer\u2019s dipping into his rhetorical cesspool for something to throw at the president.\n\nMr. Schumer, a New York Democrat, has said that if we don\u2019t throttle the Trumpster for telling some leftist congresswomen to go back where they came, we\u2019re \u201cfellow travelers on the president\u2019s racist road\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d to boot.\n\nWhen are we going to say aloud that we\u2019ve had it with being bullied as racists by racists? When are we going to roar that we\u2019re as mad as hell and are not going to take it anymore?\n\nNow doesn\u2019t seem too soon.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
