These kinds of activities are seen as having a hidden agenda.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to the insecurity, to the paranoia of the ruling regime in Iran. The regime feels under pressure from foreign powers. Even though what this couple is said to have done appears, from the outside, to be mundane, to be benign, to Tehran it looks suspicious, it looks like spying.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bloggers Mark Firkin and Jolie King were travelling overland from Perth to London in a Toyota Landcruiser they converted into a mobile home.

The Guardian understands the Cambridge-educated British-Australian academic had been teaching at a university in Melbourne. She was arrested last year and tried (the nature of the charges are not publicly known) and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nShe is reportedly being held in solitary confinement in the notorious Evin prison.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ability to negotiate on behalf of its citizens held in Iranian jails might once have been relatively strong. But its bargaining position has been weakened by its overt alignment to bellicose American policy in the Middle East.\n\nIn August, Australian became only the third country to commit to a US-led coalition patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway off Iran\u2019s south coast through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. Scott Morrison said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Evin prison in Tehran. Photograph: Ulrich Baumgarten/Getty Images\n\nUS officials \u2013 including senior figures such as the just-deposed national security adviser John Bolton and the secretary of state Mike Pompeo \u2013 have been seen as advocates for regime change in Iran (though Donald Trump has disavowed this publicly).\n\nHowever this, combined with the US president\u2019s unilateral decision to tear up the Iran nuclear deal (widely regarded as successfully negating Iranian nuclear ambitions) and to reimpose crippling economic sanctions, has squeezed Iran into a political and economic corner.\n\nBritain-Iran relationship caught up in mutual blame game Read more\n\nIn recent history, relations between Iran and Australia have been robust, if not always smooth. Australia has maintained diplomatic relations with Tehran through decades where other western nations have abandoned them or they have become acutely strained. After the signing of the nuclear deal in 2015, then foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was one of the first international figures to visit Tehran.\n\nBut those ties have weakened: Australia hosts significant numbers of Iran students (mainly at postgraduate level) but trade between the two countries has diminished in recent years. Australia has few diplomatic levers to pull, Akbarzadeh argues.\n\n\u201cI think Australia\u2019s presence in the Persian Gulf [patrolling with the US] is largely symbolic, it will be small and not very effective,\u201d the professor says. \u201cBut it sends a signal and Iran has received that signal: it says Australia is firmly in the US camp and firmly supports the US sanctions on Iran.\u201d\n\nCanberra\u2019s adherence to a hawkish US policy has undermined Australia\u2019s ability to speak to the Iranian government, Akbarzadeh says.\n\n\u201cThe leadership in Iran wants to speak to foreign powers on an equal footing, they don\u2019t want to be lectured, talked down to, or coerced into a position of weakness.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s foreign affairs minister has previously floated the idea of a prisoner swap, essentially conceding that those foreign nationals held in Iranian jails might be used as hostages in order to free Iranians (there are currently about 12 foreign nationals in Iranian prisons, most holding dual Iranian citizenship not recognised by Tehran).\n\nBut significantly, Akbarzadeh argues, the Australians held in Iranian jails are under the control of the country\u2019s judiciary, which historically holds to a much harder line on foreign national prisoners than the foreign ministry does.\n\nAustralia has also lost potentially crucial leverage in the form of Iranian citizen Negar Ghodskani, who was held in an Adelaide jail for more than two years while she fought a US extradition request over allegations of sanctions busting.\n\nGhodskani was eventually extradited. Last month, she pleaded guilty in an American court to being part of a conspiracy to evade US sanctions and illegally export controlled technology. She faces up to five years in jail.\n\nIran was displeased by Australia\u2019s acquiescence to the US request to arrest Ghodskani in 2017, to the extent of repeatedly summoning Australia\u2019s ambassador to protest her arrest and treatment (Ghodskani was pregnant when arrested and went on to give birth while in prison).\n\nIn April this year, while Ghodksani was still in Australia, Iran\u2019s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif publicly canvassed her as a candidate for a prisoner swap for British citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe (though it is unlikely Australia would ever have acceded in the face of US opposition).\n\nBut that potential diplomatic leverage is gone, the US alliance on which Australia depends for its security is acutely damaging in Tehran, and Australia has few other levers to pull.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Canberra\u2019s adherence to a hawkish US policy has undermined its ability to negotiate with the paranoid and sanctions-squeezed regime in Tehran", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66282841a9593768885dcd4a575116b9d469baad/0_218_1810_1086/master/1810.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0ea352ce318b5a3ec9f2f035828ede8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
