They were fraught with political risk, but resulted in the biggest wins of Pence\u2019s tenure.\n\nIn the span of two weeks, Pence salvaged a tenuous and short-term peace between Turkey and Kurdish forces, quelling an uproar in Washington after Republicans blasted Trump\u2019s withdrawal in Syria. A week later, the vice president rebuked Beijing\u2019s record on human rights -- in a speech long-sought by both Republicans and Democrats -- without disrupting fragile U.S.-China trade talks.\n\nThe performances suggest the White House may increasingly turn to the vice president to handle politically thorny situations as a parade of impeachment witnesses further weaken Trump\u2019s ability to get anything done in Washington. In October, the number of Americans supporting the House inquiry grew to more than half, according to a RealClearPolitics average of public polling.\n\nTrump reclaimed the limelight over the weekend with an announcement that U.S. troops had killed the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The foreign policy victory offered Trump a reprieve from a flood of impeachment-related news, but it\u2019s likely to be brief.\n\nPence has also almost single-handedly led efforts to pressure House Democrats to vote for Trump\u2019s rewrite of Nafta -- likely the only major Trump initiative that stands a chance of passing Congress before the 2020 elections. The vice president has been criss-crossing the U.S. to sell the deal -- traveling last week to key swing states Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and this week to Virginia.\n\nHe\u2019s also stumping for GOP gubernatorial candidates in Louisiana and Kentucky this week and will headline a fundraising event in Texas for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\n\u2018Relentlessly On Message\u2019\n\nMatt Gorman, a Republican strategist, said Pence is a popular visitor for GOP officeholders across the country.\n\n\u201cThere are not a lot of places he can\u2019t go. He can appeal to all segments of the party, whether it\u2019s the MAGA crowd or the more establishment lane,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cAnd the most important part is that he is relentlessly on message. He\u2019s not going to make news on anyone other than who he\u2019s there to support.\u201d\n\nMarc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, dismissed the notion that Pence is filling a leadership void created by the impeachment inquiry. The vice president is relentlessly deferential to his boss, known in Washington for heaping praise on Trump at public events.\n\nBut Short said there is a benefit to Pence\u2019s focus on core issues in his appearances.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of a conversation about impeachment, the vice president is showing the hard work that is being done by this administration on behalf of the American people,\u201d Short said.\n\nUkraine Connections\n\nStill, Pence is politically anchored to Trump and has his own troublesome connections to the impeachment inquiry, which is centered on whether Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump drew Pence into the inquiry during a Sept. 25 news conference, telling reporters they should ask for the vice president\u2019s communications with Zelenskiy because the records would show their discussions were \u201cperfect.\u201d Pence, who met with Zelenskiy on Sept. 1 in Warsaw, has said he doesn\u2019t object to releasing accounts of his communications.\n\nWilliam Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, testified last week that Zelenskiy had asked Pence directly about about security assistance that had been frozen during their Warsaw meeting. Pence didn\u2019t answer definitively but said that Trump wanted European countries to do more to support Ukraine and for Kyiv to more aggressively probe corruption, according to Taylor. Pence has denied raising the topic of Biden with Ukraine\u2019s leader.\n\nWithin the White House, there are concerns about precedent and executive privilege that are holding up a final decision to release records of Pence\u2019s interactions with Zelenkskiy to the public, according to a senior administration official. NBC News reported earlier on Tuesday that some of Trump\u2019s allies are concerned that records of Pence\u2019s communications with Zelenskiy could make the president\u2019s own interactions with the Ukrainian leader look even worse.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- October has been one of President Donald Trump\u2019s worst months in office -- and one of Mike Pence\u2019s best.As a series of damaging revelations in the House impeachment inquiry weighed on Trump, the vice president was thrust into the spotlight twice as the point-man on major policy issues.", "authors": ["Jordan Fabian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8hwwAyNL8K.VWp2OD8.Wgw--~B/aD00MDQ7dz01OTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f4666d96ef43b8417d666ca97a356221", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
