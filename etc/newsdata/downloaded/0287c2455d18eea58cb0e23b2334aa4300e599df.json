Israel's ex-military chief aims at premiership", "language": "en", "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Confronted by a right-wing heckler while campaigning for last month\u2019s parliamentary election in Israel, Benny Gantz grabbed the man by the lapels and glared down at him.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White party looks on during his party faction meeting at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in Jerusalem October 3, 2019. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s doing anything wrong by you,\u201d Gantz, who leads the centrist Blue and White Party, told him. \u201cWe only want what\u2019s good for you.\u201d\n\nThe encounter was part embrace, part menace, and highly ambiguous. So is much else about Gantz, who will try to form a government after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decision to abandon his own attempts to put together a new coalition.[\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin turned to Netanyahu first after the Sept. 17 election, in which no party won a majority. Gantz, was next in line after Blue and White won 33 seats in parliament, one more than Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud.\n\nThe 60-year-old general, nicknamed \u201cThe Prince\u201d as he rose through army ranks, now has the chance to dethrone Netanyahu, who is sometimes referred to as \u201cKing Bibi\u201d after dominating Israeli politics for more than a decade as prime minister.\n\nAs chief of the Israeli military between 2011 and 2015, Gantz was a consensus figure. He has tried to retain his broad appeal as head of Blue and White, a newly formed party named after the national colours.\n\nBut what he would do in power is not completely clear as he had avoided committing himself on some important issues.\n\nGantz casts himself as more diplomatically accommodating than Netanyahu, urging redoubled efforts to restart peace talks with the Palestinians, but has stopped short of any commitment to the statehood they seek.\n\nSupporters see Gantz\u2019s reticence as an attempt to calm the political scene after two elections this year - Netanyahu also failed to form a government after an April ballot. They say Gantz would rather keep his own counsel than sap his credibility with promises that voters know will never be delivered.\n\nAs top general, Gantz orchestrated two Gaza wars in which around 2,300 Palestinians were killed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t differentiate between either Gantz or Netanyahu,\u201d said Moussa Abu Mazouk of Gaza\u2019s dominant Hamas Islamists.\n\nThe more moderate Palestinian Authority has said it is open to talking to any Israeli leader. But Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestine Liberation Organization official, also said before the September election that Gantz was no different from Netanyahu.\n\nQUESTIONS OF CHARACTER\n\nGantz, who is 6 foot 3 inches (1.91 metres) tall, was brought up on a collective farm founded by Holocaust survivors including his parents, and had a stint in a religious school. He is married to an ex-paratrooper with whom he has four children.\n\nThroughout the election he attacked Netanyahu over corruption allegations that have dogged the prime minister for years, and which the veteran leader denies.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s counter-charge that a suspected Iranian hack of Gantz\u2019s cellphone may have opened him up to blackmail by Israel\u2019s enemy did not appear to dent the challenger\u2019s image.\n\nA more earthy orator than Netanyahu, he makes occasional scriptural word play and is given to reminding listeners of his military background. When his party won more seats than Netanyahu, he spoke of having fulfilled his \u201cmission\u201d and of his rival having failed in his.\n\nNetanyahu has cast Gantz as a \u201cweak leftist\u201d who was gun-shy on Iran and the Palestinians while in uniform.\n\nIt was, however, Netanyahu who appointed Gantz as Israel\u2019s top general and, at the time, praised him as \u201can officer and a gentleman ... a warrior and a human being\u201d.\n\nAs a brigadier-general in 1999, Gantz took over a liaison unit to Lebanese allies. By the following year, when Israel withdrew from south Lebanon, Gantz was a media darling.\n\nHe went on to serve a relatively short period in the West Bank, where a Palestinian revolt raged. Gantz later commanded forces on the Lebanese border but was reassigned before the inconclusive 2006 war with Hezbollah, so was spared much of the after-action blowback from an Israeli inquest.\n\nHow he won the nickname \u201cThe Prince\u201d is unclear. Some say it stemmed from his assured rise through the ranks, others from what critics call his sense of entitlement.\n\nGantz has dismissed suggestions he lacks the stomach to fight. Referring to a Hamas military commander whom he ordered assassinated in 2012, he said in January: \u201cThe heads of the terrorist groups need to know that Ahmed Jaabari was not the first, nor may he be the last.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: Benny Gantz, leader of Israel's Blue and White party, gestures as he delivers a statement before his party faction meeting in Tel Aviv, Israel September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo/File Photo\n\nRetired U.S. general Martin Dempsey, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff between 2011 and 2015 was Gantz\u2019s counterpart, recalled, in an interview with Reuters in January, that Gantz was a \u201csuperb leader\u201d in that role.\n\nGantz has made no secret of learning on the job, and is leaning on his partners in the Blue and White leadership, who include two other former military chiefs of staff, a former defence minister and a former finance minister.\n\n(This story refiles to add January date in paragraph 23).", "description": "Confronted by a right-wing heckler while campaigning for last month's parliamentary election in Israel, Benny Gantz grabbed the man by the lapels and glared down at him.", "authors": ["Dan Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444144399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1DZ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
