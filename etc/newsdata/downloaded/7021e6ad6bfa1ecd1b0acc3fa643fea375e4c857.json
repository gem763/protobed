It asks you to swipe around to open a Pokeball, then swipe some more as you interact with the Pokemon that pop out, waving at them and giving them pets.\n\nIt\u2019s all over very quickly, and were that all there was to it it wouldn\u2019t be worth writing about here. But once you\u2019re done with the tutorial, you can then set the Pokemon as your everyday wallpaper, and the wallpaper retains all the interactivity of the demo.\n\nSo every time you wave at your phone the Pokemon is on the screen\u2014and it could be Pikachu, Eevee or Sword & Shield\u2019s three starters\u2014will wave back. In a very nice touch the Pokemon will even follow your finger around with its head and eyes if you\u2019re dragging it over the screen, and the background will change depending on what time of day it is and the weather outside (and when it\u2019s late, the Pokemon will be asleep).\n\nIt\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to make you buy a Pixel, and even if you did, it\u2019s not exactly the kind of thing that\u2019s going to maintain your interest for months on end. But if you\u2019re a Pokemon fan and were already thinking of picking one of these phones up, it\u2019s a pretty cool way to show off the phone\u2019s motion features to friends!", "description": "I picked up my new Pixel 4XL yesterday, and instead of rushing to test out the new camera, radar features or terrifyingly fast face-scanning, the first thing I did with the new phone was...play with some interactive Pok\u00e9mon wallpapers....", "authors": ["Stephen Totilo", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/oamhhq6erb6uqcfxpooa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
