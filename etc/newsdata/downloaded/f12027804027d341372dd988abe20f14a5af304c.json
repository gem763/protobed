All we ever wanted was a little girl and she was just an amazing mum.\n\n\"Everything she did was for the kids.\n\n\"She was my childhood sweetheart.\"\n\nThe dad now faces bringing up their four children alone and has been unable to work while he's grieving and juggling looking after the kids.\n\nHe also has to think about how to transport his partner's body back from the hospital in Sheffield where she had been receiving specialist care.\n\n\"It's just been so hard,\" admitted Jason.\n\n(Image: Jason McKevitt)\n\nThe chef said Susan started to \"cough up blood\" and the couple immediately called the ambulance out of concern, but were told it wasn't anything too serious.\n\nFollowing tests at hospital, Susan was told her baby girl was not growing properly, and she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, which needed immediate medical intervention.\n\nJason said his partner of 11 years was informed the \"right hand side of her heart was blocked,\" despite Susan being \"fit and healthy\" and not a drinker or smoker.\n\nThe family were told the best care Susan could get would be at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, in Sheffield, which split the couple up as Jason had to divide his time between childcare and driving to Sheffield.\n\n(Image: Jason McKevitt)\n\nJason said: \"She got moved there and all the while she was asking 'am I going to die? Am I going to see my kids again?'\"\n\nHe claims that Susan was reassured that \"she would be OK\".\n\nBefore giving birth, Jason said Susan called to say \"I love you\".\n\nBut then he received a call from the hospital.\n\n\"I was on my way to pick the kids up from school and I got a call to say 'you need to get to Sheffield, she's poorly,'\" he recalled.\n\n\"We tried to get a police escort there, but we couldn't and I was driven. I was asking them 'what's happened, what's happened' but they would not tell me.\n\n(Image: Jason McKevitt)\n\n\"I knew at the back of my heart something had happened.\"\n\nJason said Susan \"didn't even get to meet\" their baby, the first girl in the whole family, who they named Leila.\n\nThe little girl was born prematurely and weighed just 4lbs after Susan delivered her while 36 weeks pregnant. Because of her condition, she had to stay in hospital to be cared for.\n\nAfter spending time with his new baby, Jason had to come back to Liverpool to look after his sons, Liam, 10, Jason, seven and Jamie, two.\n\nHe said the support since Susan's death has been \"amazing\" and \"everyone has really pulled together.\n\nClair Solan, a friend of Jason's for eight years, set up a JustGiving page to help the family during the tough time.\n\n(Image: Jason McKevitt)\n\nShe wrote: \"Within hours of the family gaining their much awaited baby girl, they lost their mother and partner.\n\n\"Jason and his family will never be the same again, while waiting for his baby girl to come home from Sheffield he has to put aside his own grief and support his three beautiful boys.\n\n\"The aim of this fund raising is to try and remove at least one worry from this heartbreaking time. The funds raised will help the family to pay for the costs involved with the funeral and also towards securing the childrens future.\"\n\nA friend of Jason's has set up a JustGiving page to help the family following the \"unbelievable\" tragedy.
