And I hope that if our British friends decide to return one day, our door will always be open.\u201d\n\nBritish and EU negotiators reached the agreement after successive days of late-night talks and nearly three years of heated discussions that have strained EU-UK ties at a time the bloc is facing a wave of euroscepticism, struggling to restart economic growth and take a stand against resurgent global powers China and Russia.\n\nJohnson said he was confident that parliament, which will sit for an extraordinary session on Saturday to vote on the Brexit agreement, would approve the deal.\n\n\u201cWhen my colleagues in parliament study this agreement they will want to vote for it on Saturday and then in succeeding days,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nBut the arithmetic in the vote is not simple.\n\nThe Northern Irish party that Johnson needs to help ratify any agreement, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), has refused to support it, saying it is not in Northern Ireland\u2019s interests.\n\nThe head of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said he was \u201cunhappy\u201d with the agreement and would vote against it. Labour has said it wants any deal to be subject to a public vote, but as yet has not indicated whether it will back any move for a second referendum on Saturday.\n\nJohnson does not have a majority in the 650-seat parliament, and in practice needs at least 318 votes to get a deal ratified. The DUP have 10 votes. Parliament defeated a previous deal struck by Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, three times.\n\nDeutsche Bank estimated there was a 55% chance parliament would reject Johnson\u2019s deal, and other analysts thought similar.\n\nJohnson appears intent on presenting parliament with a stark choice - the deal he has struck or no deal - in the hope of securing just enough votes, including perhaps from the opposition benches, to secure a knife-edge approval.\n\n\u201cThe PM\u2019s position is that it\u2019s new deal or no deal but no delay,\u201d said a senior British government official.\n\nIf the deal is approved, economists said Britain was likely headed for a \u201cfairly hard\u201d Brexit, certainly a harder one than would have been the case under May\u2019s deal.\n\n(DIS)UNITY\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said one positive with the Johnson deal was that it was clear Britain would become what the EU calls a \u201cthird country\u201d, making it essential for the EU to work rapidly on reaching a free trade agreement with it.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker after agreeing on the Brexit deal, at the sidelines of the European Union leaders summit, in Brussels, Belgium October 17, 2019.

Now it is quite clear.\u201d\n\nJohnson spoke to the other EU leaders for about 30 minutes during his first - and possibly last - summit in Brussels.\n\nIn a sign of the times for the bloc, which has never yet lost a member, he is expected to skip the second day of discussions on the EU\u2019s future budget and tackling climate change.\n\nAs Britain took a step closer to leaving the EU after more than four decades, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar made a case for the union.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a small nation, I have felt enormous solidarity from our European partners,\u201d he said, bidding farewell to Britain, \u201can old friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe unity that we have seen in the last few years is a lesson to us for the future... something we take forward for future negotiations. Not just with the UK, but the U.S. and China and Turkey and others.\u201d\n\n\u2018BACKSTOP\u2019 GONE\n\nNegotiators worked frantically this week to agree a compromise on the question of the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland, the most difficult part of Brexit.\n\nThe conundrum was how to prevent the frontier becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s single market without erecting checkpoints that could undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of conflict in the province.\n\nThe agreement reached will keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs area but EU tariffs will apply on goods crossing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland if they are headed to Ireland and into the bloc\u2019s single market.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nThe agreement scraps the \u201cbackstop\u201d, a mechanism envisaged earlier that was designed to prevent a hard border being introduced on the island of Ireland, and would have bound at least parts of Britain to some EU rules.\n\nHowever, the DUP, which supports Johnson\u2019s government, said the new text was not acceptable - a step that could spur hardline Brexiteers in his Conservative party to vote it down.\n\n\u201cThese proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic wellbeing of Northern Ireland,\u201d the party said.\n\nThe uncertainty over parliament\u2019s approval means that, two weeks before Britain is due to leave the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, the possible outcomes still range from an orderly departure to a chaotic exit or even another referendum that could reverse the entire endeavour.", "description": "European Union leaders unanimously backed a new Brexit deal with Britain on Thursday, leaving Prime Minister Boris Johnson facing a battle to secure the UK parliament's backing for the agreement if he is to take Britain out of Europe on Oct. 31.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441982690&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1D7", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
