Giuliani will have until October 15 to comply and give up the \u201ctext messages, phone records, and other communications\u201d that could further implicate himself and the president.\n\nSubpoena sent to Giuliani from House investigators leading the impeachment inquiry. pic.twitter.com/iTudJ2GSEU \u2014 Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) September 30, 2019\n\nBut as Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, and Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings note in their letter, Giuliani has kind of already been doing that. \u201cA growing public record, including your own statements, indicates that the president, you, and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically motivated investigations,\u201d the letter states. \u201cFor example, on September 19, 2019, you admitted on national television that you personally asked the government of Ukraine to target Vice-President Biden. During an interview on CNN, Chris Cuomo asked you, \u2018So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u2019 You responded, \u2018Of course I did.\u2019 In addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence \u2026 indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump administration officials may have been involved in this scheme.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer joins an increasingly long list of Trump allies and administration officials facing subpoenas or depositions, showing that House Democrats intend to quickly pursue only the Ukraine scandal and its cover-up in the impeachment inquiry. On Monday, the House committees also scheduled depositions with three attorneys who have worked with Giuliani on the Ukraine matter: Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman, and Semyon Kislin. On Wednesday, the former ambassador to Ukraine Masha Yovanovitch and Trump\u2019s Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker will sit for depositions; on Friday, Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who reviewed the whistle-blower complaint for the intelligence community, will appear before the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has also been subpoenaed; on Monday, it was revealed that he too was on the July 25 call to Zelensky. And speaking with CBS News, Schiff said the House Intelligence Committee has \u201can agreement that he or she will testify,\u201d referring to the intelligence-officer whistle-blower who broke the scandal open.", "description": "Representing the House committees heading the impeachment inquiry of Donald Trump, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani for documents related to pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Hunter Biden.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/30/30-rudy-giuliani.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
