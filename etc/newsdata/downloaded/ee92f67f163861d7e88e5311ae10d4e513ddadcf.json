The death count was also wildly off. They have since deleted the tweet, but not before Twitchy captured it.\n\nSome Twitter users pointed out it sounded an awful lot like Rep. Ilhan Omar's description of 9/11 as when \"some people did something.\"\n\nDid Omar and Tlaib write that article? \u2014 GlennAC (@GlennAC14) September 11, 2019\n\nSome planes did something \u2014 Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) September 11, 2019\n\nMan, those towers really must have done something to upset those airplanes. https://t.co/N0WUjV2Gt5 \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) September 11, 2019\n\n\u201cOn December 7, 1941, airplanes took aim and seriously damaged the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor.\" https://t.co/8mh6i0f4sv \u2014 Jim Geraghty (@jimgeraghty) September 11, 2019\n\nThis may be the worst tweet of the day.\n\n\n\nGreat job. https://t.co/vNrtILiBgc \u2014 Pradheep J.
