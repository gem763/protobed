Adam Schiff (Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee; Eliot Engel (N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Elijah Cummings (Md.), who chairs the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nIn the letter, the three lawmakers note that Giuliani admitted on CNN that he asked the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on Biden, whom Trump could face off against in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence \u2015 in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications \u2015 indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nGiuliani must comply with the subpoena by Oct. 15. He quickly questioned its legality, while also saying in a tweet he will give it \u201cappropriate consideration.\u201d\n\nI have received a subpoena signed only by Democrat Chairs who have prejudged this case. It raises significant issues concerning legitimacy and constitutional and legal issues including,inter alia, attorney client and other privileges. It will be given appropriate consideration. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 30, 2019\n\nAmong the required documents are any Giuliani has that are related or refer to Biden\u2019s son Hunter, or to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter once served on the board. Trump has repeatedly pushed the conspiracy theory that Biden once used his power as vice president to help the company by pushing for the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma. No evidence has surfaced supporting that theory.\n\nThe subpoena also calls for any documents or communications that concern U.S. foreign assistance to Ukraine. According to a summary of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump implied that such aid was at stake if the country did not investigate Biden.\n\nShortly after Schiff, Engel and Cummings announced their subpoena of Giuliani, Trump tweeted a video clip in which he defended the call with Zelensky, saying it \u201cwas perfect\u201d and claiming that the whistleblower \u2015 an intelligence official who filed a formal complaint about Trump\u2019s Ukraine efforts, and whose identity has not been made public \u2015 is at fault for making a false report.\n\nThis story has been updated with comment from Rudy Giuliani.", "description": "The heads of three committees are demanding that President Donald Trump's personal lawyer provide documents related to the Ukraine scandal.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9260602400003400d52e79.jpeg?cache=ggefkzkvns&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
