An Iraqi national, Baghdadi was the son of a Muslim preacher.\n\nHe was an academic and en route to a PhD when his sights turned to Salafi jihadism in 2003 as US troops invaded. It would be less than a decade before he became known for beheadings, bombings and unfolding mass terror.\n\nHaving joined a local resistance movement during the invasion, Baghdadi was detained by US forces at Camp Bucca in 2004. Considered a low-level threat by US forces, he was released after ten months.\n\nBaghdadi gravitated towards al-Qaeda in Iraq. In 2006, when its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in a US airstrike, the group rebranded itself as the Islamic State of Iraq.", "description": "The man that stood at the helm of the world\u2019s most feared terrorist organisation in modern times carefully controlled a fractious mix of domestic jihadists and disillusioned foreign extremists, creating an army that would for a time impose its brutal rule over eight million people.", "authors": ["Abbie Cheeseman", "Benedict Spence", "Nick Timothy", "Michael Gove", "Matthew Lesh"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214265134-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPub6cMGLJeoIKaont4MAjPjQiGVJTn9Dl0DGXdwYz48.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
