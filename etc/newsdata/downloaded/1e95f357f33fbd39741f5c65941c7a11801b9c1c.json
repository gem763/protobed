He baselessly accused Hammond of propagating a \u201cdisgusting antisemitic controversy\u201d on Twitter \u2013 before deleting the tweet and then apologising.\n\nHammond had threatened to sue, and he appeared to have grounds for doing so. He made no mention of ethnicity, nor has he ever swum in the antisemitic swamp (unlike others in today\u2019s Tory fold, and Labour fold too).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Their conclusions have ranged from not guilty, even though he pals around and gets money from them, to the famous not proven verdict available under Scottish law.\n\nHowever, if the veracity of the claim is what concerns you, you\u2019re missing the point.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nRaising the question of who is backing \"man of the people\" Johnson, and pointing to his undoubted links with hedge funds and other casino capitalists, seeks to flip a switch by portraying him, instead, as the financiers\u2019 man.\n\nWhen voters start to wonder why it\u2019s Leave \"do or die\"? Why the prime minister has been speaking so aggressively and carelessly? Then it would be no surprise if their gaze fell on his mates' bonuses. They profit from our pain; they delight in blowing things up. They may point to the fact that there is someone on the other side of every trade, winners and losers with every roll of the dice in financial markets. But that's not the point.\n\nThere may well be no ideology in currency or equity trading \u2013 it is all about profit \u2013 but if you take that view, could that not mean that a bet on a hard Brexit with a no-deal PM may be motivated by the expectation of financial gain?\n\nIf the PM gets a no deal, and things really do blow up (as they surely will), and the charge is repeated during a subsequent general election campaign, he\u2019s going to be in trouble. That\u2019s when Hammond's narrative will really take flight.\n\nIn raising the question, Johnson\u2019s opponents have used his own tactics against him. It's what he tried to do by referring to the Benn Act as \u201cthe Surrender Act\u201d when all it does is mandate him to seek a short extension to Britain\u2019s EU membership if he can\u2019t fix up a deal. T\n\nhat's what makes this affair so precious.\n\nExcept \u2013 and here\u2019s the best part \u2013 they\u2019ve done it without the need to rely upon on lies.\n\nTake Macpherson, who said in a tweet that Hammond was \u201cright to question the political connections of some of the hedge funds with a financial interest in no deal\u201d. That was it; no more, no less.\n\nIt is very hard to honestly argue with that. He who pays the piper calls the tune, after all, and Johnson has certainly received cash from the casino end of the City.\n\nIt\u2019s a legless story that has somehow run away,\u201d Odey groused in his FT interview.\n\nExcept that it isn\u2019t. The legs come from the very legitimacy of the question. People understand that those who bankroll politicians expect something in return, and they are starting to feel uncomfortable about who it is that Johnson represents.\n\nThe story will keep on running \u2013 not least because Hammond is a substantial political figure who has forgotten more than most people know about high finance, Rachel is Boris\u2019s sister, and Macpherson is a serious and high-minded individual.\n\nI\u2019d be surprised if they don\u2019t kick Johnson again.", "description": "Was the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, right to accuse Boris Johnson of being backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit, and expect to profit from the disastrous effects of crashing out of the EU without a deal?", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/01/06/10/crispin-odey.gif"}
