In this situation, they would need to make a claim from their travel insurer for the cost.\n\nIn more extreme cases, such a wedding, there may be a host of other things that could be affected. Specialist cover, such as wedding insurance, may be the only route for those left out of pocket.\n\nImage copyright PA Media\n\nCould I switch to another holiday?\n\nNo, holidaymakers with package deals get a refund, as that is what the ATOL protection states.\n\nSome other operators which used Thomas Cook flights will try to switch their customers to an alternative at no extra cost.\n\nI have only booked a flight with Thomas Cook, what are my rights?\n\nThe ATOL protection covers packages, not flight-only deals. So that means you would not get an automatic refund.\n\nInstead, it is likely you would need to make a claim on travel insurance. That is why it is always advised to buy travel insurance at the same time as booking a holiday. Some policies have an exclusion for the collapse of an airline, so not everyone will be covered.\n\nA spokesman for the Association of British Insurers says: \"As a last resort, travel insurance with scheduled airline failure cover can cover the cost of a flight when the airline has gone into administration. A travel insurance policy with travel disruption cover will cover the cost of new travel arrangements.\"\n\nThe other alternative is claiming a refund from the provider of the credit or debit card you used, so-called section 75 rules.\n\nThere may be a little more protection if the hotel you booked was linked to the flight, such as a click-through when booking the flight.\n\nI'm on holiday now, what do I do?\n\nAt the moment, enjoy your break as much as you can - do not cut it short.\n\nUK customers will be brought home \"as close as possible\" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said.\n\nCustomers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to be posted on a dedicated website as soon as they are available.\n\nThe DfT added that a \"small number\" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs.\n\nThomas Cook had 600,000 customers on holiday from around the world, including up to 160,000 from the UK, so it will be a huge logistical challenge.\n\nWhen the Monarch airline collapsed, there were arguments for a better repatriation system, but nothing has been implemented as yet.\n\nThose on flight-only deals were also repatriated following the Monarch collapse, by order of the government.\n\nI've been given a Thomas Cook gift card. Will it be of use?\n\nNothing is clear on that yet.\n\nImage copyright Thomas Cook\n\nIt is highly likely that gift cards or vouchers will be worthless, consumer experts say.\n\nIt will depend on what happens to the company, whether it is rekindled and whether any vouchers would then be honoured. If they are useless, then the person who bought it might be able to make a claim to their credit card provider if it was a generous gift of more than \u00a3100, or their debit card provider for less.\n\nWhat about other services, such as sport packages?\n\nThomas Cook ran domestic ticket and hotel packages for sporting events.\n\nIt is unclear what would happen to those bookings, but as most people would not have any insurance cover for such a trip, a refund claim would probably have to be made to the provider of the credit or debit card used to pay.", "description": "The travel company has collapsed, affecting hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers.
