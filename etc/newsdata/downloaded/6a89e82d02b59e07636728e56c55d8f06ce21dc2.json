(Photo: Brian Kahn, G/O Media)\n\nSolving climate change requires drastic action, and the activist group Extinction Rebellion is here for it.\n\nThe group has exploded on the climate scene in the past year.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s leading a coordinated series of actions around the globe that kicked off with them dousing Wall Street in fake blood in New York, blocked roads in Mumbai, and staged various roadway takeovers in London.\n\nNow they\u2019re back at it again on Friday. The group, which uses civil disobedience to ring the alarm on the climate crisis, shut down the London City Airport Thursday with James Brown, a Paralympian who climbed atop a British Airways plane before takeoff.\n\nAnother man made it onto an aeroplane and refused to sit in his seat, delaying the flight for two hours. Meanwhile in New York, protesters dropped a boat in the middle of Times Square, snarling traffic in one of the city\u2019s busiest hubs.\n\nProtesters deflated the tires of the boat trailer and then glued their hands to the hull while other sat-in around them. Police cordoned off Seventh Ave. and 44th St., which run right through the heart of Times Square. Tourists took the opportunity to snap selfies on the suddenly empty streets while others stopped to gawk and ask what was happening.\n\nThe group told Gizmodo that approximately 62 were arrested as part of the protest. According to a WhatsApp group chat administered by Extinction Rebellion, there have been 1,145 arrests as of Thursday worldwide and the number will clearly rise with Friday\u2019s actions.\n\nIn London, protestors targeted the airport to draw attention to the impact flying has on our planet. Emissions from the industry continue to increase despite the need to reduce carbon emissions across sectors. Aviation makes up more than 2 per cent of global carbon emissions.\n\nGroups that have followed in Extinction Rebellion\u2019s footsteps but aren\u2019t officially part of it recently targeted Heathrow Airport by staging a protest flying drones designed to shutdown the airspace around it. Airports have proven to be a particularly potent target for activists in general, and Thursday\u2019s protest drew inspiration from recent protests roiling Hong Kong.\n\nAn array of people staged a sit-down protest to prevent people, including police, from entering the London City Airport on Thursday, October 10, 2019.

In addition to delaying flights, other protestors sat down in front of one of the airport\u2019s entrances to prevent people from entering. Like protesters in New York, some glued themselves to the floor and to each other.\n\nJames Brown, a Paralympian who is visually impaired, delays a flight by climbing atop the plane at London City Airport on Thursday, October 10, 2019. (Screenshot: Extinction Rebellion UK Facebook)\n\nExtinction Rebellion has said they won\u2019t stop delaying everyone else\u2019s days until the world\u2019s governments take appropriate action on climate change. The group has laid out a series of core demands that include world leaders telling the truth about the dangers of the climate crisis, declaring an international emergency, and instituting peoples\u2019 assemblies to advise governments on how to rapidly drawdown carbon emissions.\n\nIn the UK, the group has successfully lobbied the government to declare the world\u2019s first climate emergency, something Canada has followed suit on.\n\nActions are expected to continue today and into tomorrow. And given that government\u2019s have shown little appetite to act so far, they almost certainly won\u2019t be the last actions we\u2019ll see.\n\nA protester raises an Extinction Rebellion sign as a ticker in the background displays a story about blackouts in California in the face of wildfire risks.
