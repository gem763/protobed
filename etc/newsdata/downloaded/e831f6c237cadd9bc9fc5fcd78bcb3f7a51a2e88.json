(Cory Hall Photography) (Cory Hall Photography /Cory Hall Photography)\n\nThe Civil War had ended less than three decades prior. There were 42 states. The University of Iowa issued a challenge for a football game, the first college contest played west of the Mississippi River. Grinnell College answered the call. The Pioneers whooped the Hawkeyes, 24-0. The year was 1889.\n\nNow Grinnell has canceled its football schedule for the rest of 2019, citing a dearth of healthy players. The Pioneers lost 11 of their 38 players to injury during the first two games of the season, Athletic Director Andy Hamilton said in a phone interview, leaving them with one backup for each position group.\n\nAfter the third game, a 42-3 loss to MacAlester College, the coaching staff shared the injury report with Grinnell\u2019s five seniors and asked them to lead a discussion with teammates about how to handle the rest of the season. On Tuesday, the college announced it would not put a team on the field for its remaining seven games.\n\n\u201cThe College is unwilling to compromise the health and safety of its players, including the 11 players, who over the course of the first seven weeks of practice and play, will miss some or all of the season,\u201d the team said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of mixed emotions,\u201d Hamilton said in an interview. \u201cWe have five seniors who aren\u2019t going to be able to play their last seven games of their career. We have first-year student athletes that we\u2019re very keen on that won\u2019t get to finish their first season.\n\n[College football coach calls a timeout to announce his retirement, then walks off the field]\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of recognition that we made the correct choice based on the health and welfare of the students.\u201d\n\nThe college declined to make football coach Jeff Pedersen or any players available for interviews.\n\nGrinnell has struggled for years with the size of its football rosters. In the past 40 seasons, Hamilton said, the Pioneers have had seven teams with fewer than 40 players, six with more than 50 and the rest with between 40 and 50.\n\nIn the past three years, the Pioneers have had fewer than 40 players on their roster.\n\n\u201cWe would prefer to be higher. Comfortable is not a feeling that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nBut admission to Division III Grinnell, which has an undergraduate enrollment of 1,600 students, has become increasingly competitive in recent years. The college received 8,000 applications, Hamilton said, for 450 spots in the freshman class. The average two-part SAT score for newly admitted students has gone up 100 points, and the average ACT score is up between two and three points. That makes recruiting football players difficult.\n\nSo does the school\u2019s location, Hamilton said. It\u2019s hard to recruit football players from all over the nation when they can\u2019t find the village of Grinnell, Iowa, on a map.\n\nThat has led to the Pioneers viewing football a bit differently than other programs, even in Division III.\n\n\u201cWe feel the students should be playing the game,\u201d former football coach Edd Bowers, told the Associated Press in 1989, the 100th anniversary of football at the college. \u201cI think we play the game for the game\u2019s sake. I like that. It\u2019s not for the spectators.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe game has changed so tremendously, so at a place like Grinnell, it remains more or less an opportunity,\u201d then-university president George Drake said. \u201cI believe virtually anyone who likes to play football has a chance to play at Grinnell.\u201d\n\nThat remains true, Hamilton said this week. The Pioneers routinely start players who have no high school football experience. With so many roster spots open, if a student can keep up with the team\u2019s physical demands while staying on top of schoolwork, he can likely suit up on game day.\n\n\u201cIf you would have a chance to observe our team play especially when we were outnumbered the past couple of years, when we stepped on the field, it just wasn\u2019t possible for us to outscore our opponent,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cOur guys play for the love of the game, and that\u2019s one aspect that\u2019s upset our players, because they\u2019re not able to play.\u201d\n\n[Howard QB Caylin Newton will redshirt and transfer after playing four games this year]\n\nBut the troubles at Grinnell come at a rough time for high school sports and football in particular. Participation in high school sports dropped in 2018 for the first time in three decades according to the National Federation of State High School Associations. Football is leading that decline: Participation has dropped 9.1 percent over the past 10 years, and down 100,000 players since 2010.\n\nPart of that is a natural contraction in the sport\u2019s popularity, experts say, but other issues with football, including cost and injury concerns, are starting to have an impact at the college level, Hamilton said.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, we have to be experiencing some of that,\u201d he said. \u201cOur [university] president has keenly watched the statistics on high school players and where the participation rates have gone down and who is and is not participating based on location and based on income. While it\u2019s hard for us to quantify that, it has to be part of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nGrinnell will field a team in 2020, Hamilton said. The Pioneers will lose only five seniors, though more could transfer to other schools or leave the sport in the offseason. But the Pioneers are on track to have 50 players on their roster with a healthy recruiting class, he said. That would be on par with some of their rivals.\n\nHe said the school has not considered ending the football program entirely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to our football program and our football future and our football past,\u201d he said. \u201cOur circumstances were real difficult these past couple of weeks, but we\u2019re certain we made the right decision to protect our student athletes.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDerek Carr defends Vontaze Burfict, \u2018one of the most misunderstood people in the NFL\u2019\n\nTennessee football player to police during arrest: \u2018Where I\u2019m from, we shoot at cops\u2019\n\nSafeSport lifts suspension on USA Skateboarding\u2019s Neal Hendrix\n\nDamascus High returns to football field, a year after sexual assault case consumed town", "description": "The Pioneers lost 11 of their 38 players to injury during the first two games of the season.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer", "October At Pm", "Jacob Bogage Writes About Sports For The Post", "Where He Has Worked Since He Previously Covered The Automotive", "Manufacturing Industries For The Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SRaflYKQPhoMltgQ2FEO8oIIUD8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CHCAP3WZKZC3XKQXN23NDBJ4LI.JPG"}
