A flurry of urgent demands for the government to answer questions about its plans for Brexit. And all that before the profound embarrassment of having been found to have broken the law.\n\nDowning Street at this stage seems to have no intention of doing anything other than toughing this out.\n\nRead more.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: \"This is a verdict that we will respect\"\n\nSpeaking after the ruling, Mr Johnson insisted the suspension of Parliament had been necessary in order for him to bring forward a Queen's Speech on 14 October outlining his government's policies.\n\nBut critics said he was trying to stop MPs scrutinising his Brexit plans and the suspension was far longer than necessary.\n\nAddressing the UN General Assembly, Mr Johnson compared the Brexit impasse to the myth of Prometheus.\n\nReferring to how the Titan's liver was pecked out by an eagle, he said: \"And this went on forever.\n\n\"A bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK, if some of our Parliamentarians had their way.\"\n\nEarlier, the prime minister said he \"refused to be deterred\" from getting on with \"an exciting and dynamic domestic agenda\" and to do that he would need a Queen's Speech.\n\nThe court ruling does not prevent him from proroguing again in order to hold one, as long as it does not stop Parliament carrying out its duties \"without reasonable justification\".\n\nA No 10 source said the Supreme Court had \"made a serious mistake in extending its reach to these political matters\" and had \"made it clear that its reasons [were] connected to the Parliamentary disputes over, and timetable for\" Brexit.\n\nBut Supreme Court president Lady Hale emphasised in the ruling that the case was \"not about when and on what terms\" the UK left the EU - it was about the decision to suspend Parliament.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Supreme Court declared \"Parliament has not been prorogued\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling led Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to bring forward his speech at the party's conference in Brighton from Wednesday to Tuesday so that he could return to Westminster.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of cheering delegates, Mr Corbyn said: \"The government will be held to account for what it has done. Boris Johnson has been found to have misled the country. This unelected prime minister should now resign.\"\n\nThe calls for Mr Johnson to resign were echoed by Scotland's First Minister, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Wales' First Minister, Labour's Mark Drakeford, and Sinn Fein's vice president, Michelle O'Neill.\n\nDowning Street has insisted there is no question of him standing aside.\n\nAnd Mr Johnson was backed by US President Donald Trump at a joint press conference at the UN summit.\n\n\"I'll tell you, I know him well, he's not going anywhere,\" said Mr Trump, after a US reporter quizzed the prime minister on whether he was going to resign.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump: Boris Johnson \"is not going anywhere\"\n\nWhat questions do you have about the Supreme Court's decision?\n\nUse this form to ask your question:", "description": "Boris Johnson returns from New York early as Parliament reconvenes in the wake of Tuesday's ruling.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p6tw0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
