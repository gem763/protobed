It's part of a toxic legacy across Silicon Valley.", "language": "en", "text": "NASA and Google complexes in Silicon Valley are both located on Superfund sites \u2014 hazardous waste sites that can pose a risk to human health or the environment.\n\nA Google campus in Mountain View sits on land where manufacturing facilities once leaked a toxic chemical called trichloroethylene (TCE).\n\nThe chemical migrated toward a nearby NASA facility, the Ames Research Center.\n\nNow, some employees working in the area are worried about being exposed to TCE through the air.\n\nSanta Clara County \u2014 where the NASA and Google complexes are located \u2014 has more Superfund sites than any other county in the US.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more.\n\nIn 2012, Google moved 1,000 employees to a campus in Mountain View, California, about 3 miles from its Silicon Valley headquarters.\n\nThe site formerly housed a Fairchild manufacturing plant that produced semiconductors \u2014 an element in computer chips. To clean these parts, the factory relied on a colorless liquid called trichloroethylene (TCE), a chemical now understood to be cancerous to humans. There's also evidence that TCE increases the risk of miscarriages, birth defects, and developmental issues in children.\n\nThe chemical was widely used by factories in the area from the 1950s to the 1990s, resulting in extensive contamination across Silicon Valley. In 1989, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated the Fairchild plant a Superfund site \u2014 a label given to hazardous waste sites that pose a risk to human health or the environment.\n\nIn total, Santa Clara County, where the Google complex is located, has 23 active Superfund sites \u2014 more than any other county in the US.\n\nDecades later, the pollution is still a concern for local workers.\n\nFactories leaked chemicals into the soil below Google and NASA complexes\n\nGoogle's Mountain View site had roots in the tech industry long before the company arrived.\n\nFrom the 50s on, Silicon Valley was overrun by factories like the Fairchild plant that produced computer parts. For decades, TCE either leaked from those factories or was dumped into the environment by manufacturers.\n\nRead more: What Silicon Valley looked like during the early days of the tech boom\n\nFrom there, it seeped into soil and groundwater.\n\nOther Superfund sites in the area used to hold Intel and Raytheon facilities involved in semiconductor manufacturing. Together, these sites form a massive Superfund area known as Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman (MEW).\n\nJeff Chiu/AP\n\nTCE from these plants also migrated through the ground toward NASA's nearby Ames Research Center.\n\nThat land had already been contaminated with TCE from another source, though: Before NASA took over the facility in 1994, it was a military base known as the Moffett Naval Air Station. Military operations there likely used the chemical to clean engines or other aircraft parts. A 2008 report identified TCE as the \"principal contaminant\" at the base, which is now its own Superfund site.\n\nHazardous chemicals have seeped across Silicon Valley\n\nThe EPA has worked with the Navy, NASA, and various Silicon Valley computer-hardware manufacturers to clean the area's contaminated groundwater.\n\nIn the 1990s, the EPA oversaw the treatment of groundwater at NASA's Ames campus, which it continues to monitor. The agency has also removed over 76,000 pounds of contaminants from groundwater at the MEW site.\n\nAn aerial view of the NASA Ames Research Center.

The chemical can waft from the soil into the air, forming a toxic plume that could be dangerous to inhale. The EPA found that air samples at the Google complex in Mountain View showed unsafe levels of TCE from November 2012 to January 2013.\n\nA spokesperson for Google said the TCE measurements at the time indicated that the building occupants weren't in danger. Air quality was restored to safe levels less than a month after Google was notified by the EPA, the spokesperson added, and no unsafe levels have been detected in the building since. (Google said it regularly samples the air at its Mountain View office.)\n\nBut the incident raised questions about lingering health risks in the larger area.\n\nIn 2016, Tom Clausen, the vice president of the Ames Federal Employees Union, told Mountain View Voice that the Google incident made NASA employees wonder about their own health.\n\n\"When employees here at Ames heard about what's happening at Google a mile away, they're curious: 'Is the air in my workspace safe too?'\" Clausen told the paper. \"It's one thing to go into a dangerous place for a few minutes; it's another to be working in a low concentration for years.\"\n\nThe Ames Research Center told Business Insider that NASA conducts regular air sampling in buildings exposed to chemical plumes from groundwater.\n\n\"One of NASA's highest priorities is the health, safety, and welfare of our personnel,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"To date, NASA has not found any buildings within the campus area that require remedial measures.\"", "description": "NASA and Google complexes in Silicon Valley are located on Superfund sites where manufacturing plants once leaked a chemical called trichloroethylene.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b96e62e22af36663e8818?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
