Even if some of this can be put down to a form of US financial protectionism, it has hardly been a glorious episode. In Europe, HSBC has been constrained by UK ring-fencing of domestic banking, a subscale bank in France and a misfiring private bank in Geneva that brought all sorts of grief.\n\nQuinn is approaching the problem by cutting jobs and refocusing on growth markets in the Middle East and Pacific. He needs to convince investors there is more to Asia than Hong Kong, its principal market, and that it is well placed to take advantage. Tucker, certainly, was able to demonstrate this when he was running insurer AIA.\n\nThere are disappointments right across the enterprise. High inflation in Argentina (as I mention below), bills for payment protection insurance and a subsidence of trading profits in fixed income and equities did not help. The global banking unit, which serves large corporate clients, is expected to take a big jobs hit.\n\nBut something even more radical, such as splitting out the UK bank \u2013 as the Prudential has done with M&G \u2013 could be an option. More technology and fewer staff might be the start of something far more courageous.\n\nLatin lessons\n\nChristine Lagarde left Kristalina Georgieva, her successor at the International Monetary Fund, a titanic-sized problem in Argentina. Lagarde backed the reformist government of Mauricio Macri by providing Argentina with a $57 billion credit, the biggest loan package in IMF history.\n\nThe prospects of yet another Argentinian default have been greatly increased by the election of a Peronist populist Alberto Fernandez with former leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (no relation) occupying the vice-presidential seat.\n\nThe revival of the Peronists, who favour pro-worker policies, comes after an experiment with free market policies which saw inflation soar to 50 per cent, unemployment climb to above 10 per cent and one-third of the population sink into poverty. Immediate priority for the new government will be to seek a debt deal which will see creditors \u2013 including HSBC \u2013 having to take a haircut.\n\nThe Argentinian crisis is part of a Latin American earthquake. In Bolivia, Evo Morales was re-elected by a fat majority amid corruption allegations sparking riots. Chile\u2019s president Sebastian Pinera has sacked the whole cabinet after protests inflamed by a rise in underground fares.\n\nIMF forecasts show Latin America on the cusp of a slump, growing by 0.2 per cent in 2019. The hope of a pick-up next year is largely based on IMF projections of recovery in Brazil as it pulls out of deep and prolonged recession. Turmoil among the neighbours, and the possibility of Argentina going belly up, is unlikely to bolster investor confidence or contribute to global recovery.\n\nSchool lessons\n\nThe London School of Economics periodically finds itself in difficulty over sources of funding. Sir Howard Davies, now at RBS, honourably resigned in 2011 over LSE funding from Libya.\n\nAcademics at the LSE are up in arms over a partnership with China, funded by a venture capitalist with close ties to Chinese president Xi Jinping. Director Minouche Shafik should nip this row in the bud before it harms her candidacy to be the Bank of England\u2019s next governor.", "description": "Caretaker manager Noel Quinn looks to be making all the right noises about\nputting some zip back into performance, and is being allowed to hunker down and get on with the job.", "authors": ["Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
