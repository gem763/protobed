Putin of Russia, which is backing the Syrian government, said on Friday that he doubted whether Turkey or Syria had the resources to secure prison camps holding thousands of Islamic State prisoners. Kurdish forces allied with the United States had been running the prisons, but they are diverting soldiers to fight the invasion.\n\nOn Friday, the Kurdish authorities announced the evacuation of a camp housing 7,000 displaced people and said they were considering moving a second camp that holds relatives of Islamic State fighters. Kurdish forces also released video of a third camp that they said showed an attempt to escape by members of Islamic State families.", "description": "Hospitals have been abandoned, displacement camps relocated and major roads blocked as residents flee an advance of Turkey\u2019s forces.", "authors": ["Carlotta Gall", "Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/world/11syria1/11syria1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
