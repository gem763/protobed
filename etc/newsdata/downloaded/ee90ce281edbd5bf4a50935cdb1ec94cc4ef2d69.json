But honesty rarely works, says Eleanor Gordon-Smith\n\nI don\u2019t like my friend\u2019s boyfriend. He\u2019s been quite rude and makes no effort. From his behaviour, it seems he favours an \u201calpha male\u201d position and doesn\u2019t like to be contradicted, even in a very trivial way. Is it awful if I can\u2019t stand my best and oldest friend\u2019s partner? I\u2019m sure he adores her but I fear she deserves better. Can I express something along these lines or do I risk putting her in a difficult situation? Is it imperative we try to get along with our friends\u2019 partners?\n\nI, like you, have heard dozens of versions of the story that begins with \u201cshe chose the wrong man\u201d and ends in tears. If we\u2019re honest with ourselves we might even have been the protagonist in a few. It puts the truth to Sartre\u2019s old remark that hell is other people. Hell is also, and especially, the people we put up with because they love the people we love.\n\nThere are two questions here. One is whether you should say something by some kind of moral principle, and the other is whether you can pragmatically get any foothold in her mind by saying it.\n\nShould I tell my friend that I don't like the company she keeps? Read more\n\nThe problem is that in more or less all the stories you and I already know about the girl who chooses the wrong person, it\u2019s very seldom the intervention of other people that gets her to see it. Sometimes it is. But very rarely. More often she has to go through a whole lot of heartbreak and self-discovery and betrayal before she sees what everyone else sees.\n\nThe psychoanalyst Alfred Adler suggested that people often find complicated ways to cause themselves suffering, because there\u2019s an underlying need that that suffering answers. Maybe we find ourselves with manipulative people because we don\u2019t want to make our own decisions; maybe we find ourselves with cruel people because we believe we deserve suffering.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether something like that is going on for your friend, and she might not either, but ask yourself deeply and truthfully, do you think there\u2019s any chance she really doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s a jerk? Or is it that right now, for her reasons, his specific brand of jerk is just what she needs?\n\nIf that\u2019s what\u2019s going on then there\u2019s another question for you: what kind of friend do you want to be? Are you the one who points out what underlying pain she might be outsourcing to this guy? Or are you the one who lets her unravel in her own way, confident you\u2019ll be there to help her pick up her unspooled self at the other end? Only you can answer that.\n\nThen there\u2019s the moral question. There\u2019s an old principle due to Immanuel Kant: \u201cOught implies can.\u201d The question of whether you ought to try to get her to see this guy\u2019s bad character depends on whether you really think you can \u2013 and even if you can, whether you want to, or whether you prefer to let her see it in her own way. Friendship asks all kinds of peculiar, unconditional things of us. Perhaps now you\u2019re in a position to offer her the kind of genuine, patient love that this guy doesn\u2019t seem to.\n\n*************************************\n\nAsk us a question\n\nDo you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?
