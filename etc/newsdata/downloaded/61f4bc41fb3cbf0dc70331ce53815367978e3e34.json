As a result, this technology can effectively match people using camera images where the face is not visible\n\n'Using the image analysis and deep learning technologies that NEC has cultivated through facial recognition technology and other technologies, NEC was able to establish this high-precision technology that does not rely solely on facial images. '\n\nBody recognition software forms part of the Tokyo-headquartered inventor's Safer Cities initiative which aims to deploy technology to combat violent crime and terrorism.\n\nThe technology will be deployed next year, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nNEC has today been buoyed by the announcement that its facial recognition software ranked the highest accuracy of 49 companies.\n\nIn the future, it hopes to broaden its scope of recognition software application to include store transactions and payment on buses and railways.", "description": "Everyday facial recognition technology has been refined by the Tokyo-based inventor so cameras can match an  image in a database to someone's height, width, hair and apparel.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/16/19258048-0-image-a-103_1570116785862.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
