Trump has denied he did anything wrong on the call.\n\nOn Thursday, two foreign-born Florida businessmen who had helped Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani investigate Biden were arrested in what prosecutors said was a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other U.S. political candidates.\n\nThe pair, Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman, were arrested at an airport outside Washington carrying one-way tickets to Vienna. Prosecutors said they conspired to contribute foreign money, including at least $1 million from an unidentified Russian businessman, to candidates for federal and state offices to buy influence.\n\nThe two had donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump political action committee called America First Action in May 2018, and the money was falsely reported as coming from a purported natural gas company set up to conceal its true source, according to the indictment.\n\nThe investigation of Trump could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment \u2013 or formal charges \u2013 against the president in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate, where the Republicans who control the chamber have shown little appetite for ousting the president.\n\nThe testimony from Yovanovitch is the first of several depositions of key figures planned by the House committees spearheading the probe, and whether she makes her appearance will offer an early gauge of White House cooperation.\n\nYovanovitch was still expected to appear as of late Thursday, a House aide said.\n\nYovanovitch, described by colleagues as a consummate professional, became the target in March of allegations \u2013 vehemently denied by the State Department \u2013 that she gave a Ukrainian prosecutor a list of people not to prosecute.\n\nTrump allies called for her removal, accusing her of criticizing the president to foreign officials, something current and former colleagues found inconceivable. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, alleged she blocked efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAccording to a White House summary, Trump described her as 'bad news' to Zelenskiy in the July call in which he sought Zelinskiy's help to investigate Biden and his son. 'She's going to go through some things,' Trump added.\n\nOne of the foreign-born businessman arrested on Thursday, Parnas, sought the help of a U.S. congressman \u2013 identified by a person familiar with the matter as Republican Pete Sessions \u2013 to get Trump to remove Yovanovitch, according to the indictment.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters last week he had provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump.\n\nSessions lost his House seat from Texas last year to a Democrat. In a statement quoted by Politico, he said his motivation in urging the removal of Yovanovitch was his belief that 'political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.'", "description": "The White House's promise to stonewall an impeachment inquiry will get an early test on Friday, when the former ambassador to Ukraine is scheduled to testify.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/13/19586910-0-image-a-12_1570796394411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
