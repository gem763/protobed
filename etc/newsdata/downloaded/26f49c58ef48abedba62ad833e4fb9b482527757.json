To this day, Trump has not let the issue go, and even alluded to it in the phone call with Ukraine at the heart of the whistleblower complaint. And he really hammered Clinton on it during the campaign, at one point suggesting he'd jail her if elected.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly how much of an influence the focus on Clinton's emails ultimately had in her 2016 loss to Trump, which was a product of a convoluted array of factors and occurred despite her winning the popular vote.\n\nBut when Clinton left her post as Secretary of State in 2013, she had a whopping 69% approval rating. Within just a few years she would go on to become the second-most unpopular major-party presidential nominee in modern US history, surpassed only by Trump in this regard. And polling during the 2016 campaign season showed that Clinton's handling of the email scandal was hurting her with voters \u2014 including Democrats.\n\nBiden could potentially suffer similar consequences as Trump seeks to make the Ukraine scandal a story about the former vice president rather than his efforts to have a political opponent investigated.\n\nThere's no evidence to back up Trump's allegations against Biden, but that might not matter", "description": "Trump is seeking to sow doubts about Biden as the impeachment inquiry escalates and ahead of 2020, and there are growing signs it's working.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BvWjYpGMWPYorawFMPErrw--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/84e181459b3b5ee2b68fa2e6047d0063", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
