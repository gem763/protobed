The brand gave me a few bottles after we made a commercial together for National Prosecco Day. On a whim, I added a few of my favorite things from my home bar; the result, the Genesis, ended up on the Commons Club menu!\u201d\n\nWhat is the all-time best dive bar jukebox song? \u201cThe short answer is Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s \u201cShoop.\u201d The long answer is \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d I started bartending in upstate New York to pay my rent at a little neighborhood watering hole on the side of the interstate called the Gathering Lounge. J\u00e4ger Bomb Steve would come in and play \u201cPurple Rain\u201d about four or five times at the end of every night. He would cry and drink J\u00e4ger Bombs while I cleaned and savored one quarter\u2019s worth of peanut M & M\u2019s. There was something sort of sweet and profound about the sincerity of his heartbreak. At Egbert Souse\u2019s in Oakland my favorite jukebox song was \u201cStep to the Name of Love\u201d because it got the whole room bouncing, bobbing and happy. I like songs that are tied to memories.\u201d\n\nAfter all these years bartending and creating drinks, do you still enjoy going out to bars? \u201cMy recent version of \u2018going out\u2019 involves multiple Michelin stars: seeing and tasting what my peers are working on. I\u2019m more interested in quiet time with familiar faces as opposed to when I started bartending when it was more about seeing and being seen. I also love spending time at home working on my garden and decorating. I find that to be more fulfilling than going out.\u201d\n\nName the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. \u201cThe classic: Nuts and Berries. It was in Syracuse and the equal parts of Chambord, Disaronno and cream tasted like a dream come true. Later, I turned customers in Oakland onto it and when they wanted me to make it stronger, I spiked it with tequila. It caught on like wild fire and they called it Meg\u2019s Magic Tequila Milkshake. Yuck.\u201d\n\nWhat book on cocktails or spirits is your go-to resource? \u201cI use The Flavor Bible religiously to develop content for upcoming menus\u2014it\u2019s an invaluable resource. I might know I want to do something with specific flavors, like fig, but not be sure what spice will work best. The Flavor Bible will suggest different combinations that have worked in culinary applications.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite cocktail and food pairing? \u201cI\u2019m working on a Caviar Kumquat Martini to pair with Chef Adrian Garcia\u2019s iconic caviar service at Commons Club. You\u2019ll have to see it to believe it, but the garnishes are hollowed out kumquats filled with reserve caviar. Taking the savor of a Dirty Martini to a new bitter/brighter/umami level!\u201d\n\nWhat drink are you most proud of creating? \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the Womble Basher\u2019s Wock, which is currently on the Commons Club cocktail menu. The concept is a deconstructed Pi\u00f1a Colada, but using a Whiskey Sour as the base. To achieve this, I used pineapple gum to make a more tropical Whiskey Sour and top it with a coconut cream foam. When you sip the two separate layers together, they combine with the nostalgic familiarity of a summer favorite.\u201d\n\nIs there one person (dead or alive) you\u2019d like to make a cocktail for? \u201cBeyonc\u00e9. Her recent documentary Homecoming was super inspirational for me. I love how she used her platform as an opportunity to celebrate diversity.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite shot-and-a-beer combination? \u201cMezcal and as far as beer, I\u2019m into sours and cider\u2014but would not sip one with a shot. I\u2019m more of a \u2018Champagne-and-caviar\u2019 kind of girl, not so much the shot-and-a-beer type.\u201d\n\nWhat is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you\u2019re traveling for business? \u201cA left-handed corkscrew.\u201d\n\nMegan Abraham is the lead bartender at the Commons Club inside Virgin\u2019s San Francisco hotel.\n\nInterview has been condensed and edited.", "description": "The lead bartender at the Commons Club inside Virgin\u2019s San Francisco hotel tackles our speed round of questions.", "authors": ["Noah Rothbaum", "Half Full Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568221129/190912-megan-abraham-hero_kxzcgu", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
