Mondaine, president of the NAACP Tri-State Conference, said Tuesday. \"The brutality, the aggressiveness. Uh, wow. If I were to put it mildly, it would be mind-blowing.\"\n\nOregon State Police said it is still investigating the incident. It did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Tuesday.", "description": "Oregon police have released footage of the arrest of a black college student after officers stopped her for allegedly riding her bike on the wrong side of the road.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rough-arrest-oregonst-ho-mo-20191022_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
