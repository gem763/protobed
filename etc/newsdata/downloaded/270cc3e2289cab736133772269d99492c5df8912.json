Trump/Twitter)\n\nOf course, Greta\u2019s whole message is that she is actually very fearful of the future \u2014 a future that she doesn\u2019t see as being bright at all.\n\nBut instead of sending a message directly to Trump, Greta took his words and played along, using them briefly as her Twitter bio.\n\n(The Guardian)\n\nPerhaps, in this case, actions speak louder than words.\n\nChange is coming\n\nAlso at the COP24 conference in December 2018, Greta spoke directly to UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\n\nHer quote here about \u201cnot begging\u201d speaks to the spirit of her movement, which is all about kids taking charge of their own futures.\n\n(IISD Reporting Services)\n\nThe house is on fire\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, Greta turned up the heat with this matter-of-fact analogy that has become one of her most memorable quotes yet.\n\n(Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images)", "description": "Here are quotes from some of climate activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s most powerful speeches.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/GretaBarsNewThumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
