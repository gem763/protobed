Some people had MiniDisc players, but that\u2019s another story.\n\nEither way, the iPod turned 18 years old this week. To put that in context, Apple\u2019s famous gadget is older than Billie Eilish.\n\nThe chunky device was unveiled by legendary Apple co-founder Steve Jobs who said in 2001 that \u2018listening to music will never be the same again.\u2019\n\nOld school cool (Photo Courtesy of Apple Corp. via Getty Images)\n\nIt had a 5GB hard drive, was 0.75-inches thick and used the now-famous click wheel to scroll through a monochrome menu screen. You could load it up with 1,000 songs through a FireWire cable attached to your computer and even make your own playlists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018With iPod, Apple has invented a whole new category of digital music player that lets you put your entire music collection in your pocket and listen to it wherever you go,\u2019 Jobs said.\n\nBack in the day, this was the gadget to own (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nAnd now as it marks its 18th birthday, many have been getting nostalgic over the old gadget.\n\nThe @Apple #iPod turns 18 today. It revolutionized the music business, and it changed the way we interact with handheld technology (for the better, and worse).

It works beautifully still but needs a new headphone jack. Graceful, tactile physical click wheel and hefty weight. Love it.

The launch price of the product back in 2001 was $399.\n\nThe listing explained: \u2018I am a longtime Apple device collector, and this 5-Gigabyte iPod has been in my personal possession for almost two decades, kept in cool temperatures and away from sunlight. I guarantee that it has been completely unused and untouched inside its original packaging, along with its iconic headphones, charging accessories, and manuals.\u2019\n\nSteve Jobs would go on to reveal updated versions of the iPod (Photo by Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s not known how many original iPods are left, let alone factory sealed in their original condition. So, if you haven\u2019t already, it may be worth checking the attic for any old gadgets you\u2019ve got laying around up there.", "description": "The iPod is older than Billie Eilish", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92147025_1571994100.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
