Her skin is luminous. But most dermatologists would likely cringe at her technique. While face-washing seems like it should be one of our more mindless beauty exercises\u2014wash, rinse, move on\u2014as we\u2019ve become more obsessive about our skin care regimens, it has taken on greater importance. And, under this new scrutiny, the question has arisen: Are we doing it wrong?\n\nWhich is to say overdoing it. The fixation on cleanliness ingrained in us early on may be to blame for our collective desire for immaculate skin. \u201c[Squeaky clean] is not a sign of skin health\u2026our obsession with that feeling is disrupting and destroying our skin\u2019s barrier,\u201d said Dr. Whitney Bowe, a New York City dermatologist and author of \u201cDirty Looks.\u201d\n\nTAKE ME TO THE CLEANERS\n\nOur picks in seven categories of wash warfare\n\nBalm\n\nBASIC Banila Co.

Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen that delicate protective barrier is compromised, skin can feel dehydrated, reactive and experience inflammatory conditions like acne. While overwashing can be the culprit, so can washing with products that are too harsh. The acid mantle of a healthy complexion (the film on the skin\u2019s surface) has a pH of around 4 to 5.5, and an ideal cleanser should have a similar pH level. That\u2019s why Emily Parr, co-founder of HoliFrog, a new line of facial cleansers, chose to list the pH level of all the products on their labels.\n\nCleansing is always the first skin care step, which underlines its importance. \u201cIt can set the tone for the rest of your routine,\u201d said Alicia Yoon, founder of skin care line Peach & Lily. \u201cIf skin isn\u2019t cleansed well\u2026other products may not absorb as effectively, and if a cleanser is too harsh... skin faces an uphill battle.\u201d When considering cleansers, it helps to observe some parameters\u2014choose a foaming product for oilier skin, a milky or gel-based one for dry skin, an oil or balm if you\u2019re a makeup lover. These are not, however, hard and fast rules; more crucial is how a product makes your skin feel. \u201cWhen we cleanse, our skin should feel hydrated, smooth and nourished, not tight,\u201d said Dr. Bowe.\n\nFoam\n\nBASIC Face Wash, $15, laroche-posay.us; ALTERNATIVE Face Wash, $25, oneloveorganics.com; LUXE Face Wash, $45, ernolaszlo.com Photo: F.

Ms. Yoon advocates the double cleanse, a staple in Korean skin care: First use an oil-based cleanser to dissolve makeup and oily impurities; follow with a water-based cleanser to address sweat, dirt and water-based impurities. For her part, Dr. Bowe isn\u2019t convinced that arduous and potentially drying double cleansing is for everyone. She thinks frequent users of heavy makeup could benefit from it, and she might urge women who live in particularly polluted cities to consider it a few nights a week.\n\nSan Francisco facialist Kristina Holey may not think a double cleanse is essential, but she does see a benefit to spending extra time on the process. \u201cYou can use cleansing as an excuse to massage and stimulate circulation and drainage in the face,\u201d said Ms. Holey, who likes to make small circles with varying pressure over the neck and entire face.\n\nMicellar\n\nBASIC Bioderma Micellar Water, $15, walgreens.com; ALTERNATIVE Micellar Water, $26, nuriabeauty.com; LUXE Son & Park Cleansing Water, $30, sokoglam.com Photo: F.

Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen it comes to a cleanser with more active ingredients (like alpha hydroxyl acids), New York dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner tells his patients to keep it on their faces long enough to recite the alphabet, then rinse. To rinse, use lukewarm water (never hot; too drying), then gently pat the skin until it\u2019s not completely dry (products are best applied to a moist surface).\n\nThe most important cleansing advice may be this: \u201cListen to your skin,\u201d counseled Ms. Yoon. And if it sometimes wants nothing but water, Ms. Holey, for one, doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s such a bad idea. \u201cThe skin renews itself, so getting in its way too much can be more detrimental than beneficial over time,\u201d she added. An idea my grandmother could certainly get behind.\n\nOil\n\nBASIC Kristina Holey & Marie Veronique Cleansing Oil, $40, marieveronique.com; ALTERNATIVE Cleansing Oil, $49, beautycounter.com; LUXE Cleansing Oil, $48, tatcha.com Photo: F.
