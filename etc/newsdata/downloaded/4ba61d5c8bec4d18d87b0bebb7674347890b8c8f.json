Shedding the bad loans is crucial for their ability to lend and shore up their profitability.\n\nThe plan is similar to Italy\u2019s GACS model and crafted to help lenders offload bad debt by wrapping it into asset backed securities.\n\nHercules will involve setting up special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that will purchase the non-performing loans from the banks. That sale would be financed by notes issued by the SPV with a government guarantee for senior tranches, but state involvement will be limited, the Commission said.\n\n\u201cThe risk for the state will be limited since the state guarantee only applies to the senior tranche of the notes sold by the securitization vehicle,\u201d the Commission added.\n\n\u201cThe state guarantee on the senior tranche will only become effective if more than half of the non-guaranteed and risk-bearing riskier tranches have been successfully sold to private market participants,\u201d it said.", "description": "The European Commission approved on Thursday a Greek plan to reduce bad loans by up to 30 billion euros ($33.04 billion) at the country's banks, as expected, saying it did not violate state aid rules.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
