Can the rest of the field keep up?", "language": "en", "text": "Welcome to 2020 Vision, the Yahoo News column covering the presidential race with one key takeaway every weekday and a wrap-up each weekend. Reminder: There are 125 days until the Iowa caucuses and 399 days until the 2020 election.\n\nCongratulations! If you are reading this, you have survived the culmination of the third fundraising quarter of 2019, with its endless barrage of desperate emails from candidates pleading for just one more donation before time runs out.\n\nA few sample subject lines from our inbox: \u201cLeveling with you.\u201d \u201cDeadline.\u201d \u201cNot good.\u201d \u201cFinal hours.\u201d \u201cReaching.\u201d \u201cCan we finish this?\u201d\n\nTo which we answer, Yes. Please. Make it stop. And those were just from Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nNow comes the fun part. The 2020 contenders will reveal \u2014 or, tellingly, wait to reveal \u2014 how much cash they raised during the past three months. The media will crown winners and losers, scanning the Federal Election Commission reports for evidence of small-donor enthusiasm, or its absence. And one or more of the 19 Democrats still running for president might even decide to drop out.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know. The fundraising deadline was midnight Monday, but the FEC disclosure won\u2019t be posted online until the middle of the month. That means right now, it\u2019s entirely up to the campaigns to release any numbers. As of Tuesday afternoon, only three candidates have done so: Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker.\n\nSanders had the biggest haul. According to his campaign, the Vermont senator raised $25.3 million in Q3 \u2014 the largest take in a single quarter of any 2020 candidate this cycle. With 1.4 million donations, averaging just $18, that\u2019s proof that Sanders\u2019s army of grassroots fans remain committed to their man, and it should create at least one good news cycle at a time when reports have called him \u201ca candidate in decline\u201d and the polls show Sen. Elizabeth Warren vaulting into second place. The question is whether Sanders\u2019s bank balance (he raised $18 million in each of the first two quarters of the year) signifies growing support or just amounts to a defiant gesture from the 15 to 20 percent of Democrats dead set on backing him no matter what.\n\nSupporters cheer for Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

In a practical sense, Buttigieg, who is polling just behind Sanders at 11.3 percent in Iowa, has plenty of money to stay competitive; his campaign has been heavily investing in early-state infrastructure, opening 42 field offices in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The problem is that in Q2 \u2014 the period when the gay, millennial South Bend, Ind., mayor first turned a lot of heads \u2014 he managed to raise $24.8 million, shocking the pundits and setting a very high bar for future FEC reports. Already the press is noting that Buttigieg has \u201cfallen short\u201d and asking whether the smaller haul means that enthusiasm for his bid is flagging.\n\nAs for Booker, he recently cranked the desperation up to 11 and threatened to end his campaign if he failed to collect $1.7 million in the final days of the quarter. On Monday, he announced that he had surpassed that goal and would stay in the race; on Tuesday, the campaign told reporters that, fueled by its candidate\u2019s ultimatum, it had raised $6 million in Q3, a personal best. Booker is planning to use the money to hire 40 new staffers, open new field offices, build his email list and get on the ballot in 57 states. It remains to be seen, however, whether he will meet the polling threshold to qualify for the November debate.", "description": "The presidential candidates' third fundraising quarter of 2019  ended at midnight on Monday.
