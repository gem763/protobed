It rose 7.0% by 4:30 AM ET and is now up 60% from its low at the start of September.\n\nOil and gas contractors fared less well, reflecting the fact that while a windfall is guaranteed to anyone producing oil right now, it\u2019s still not clear whether the sudden rise will last long enough to incentivize more investment in alternative supply. Analysts at Rystad Energy predicted last week that the oilfield services sector was headed for a recession next year, after three years of expansion (although chief sectoral analyst Audun Martinsen still sees the sector returning to growth from 2021).\n\nBy 5 AM, Technip (PA: ) was up 3.7%, while Saipem (MI: ) was up 2.0% and Petrofac (LON: ) was up 2.1%\n\nAs far as initial reactions are concerned, airlines provided the mirror image to the oil sector\u2019s gains. The sector has been struggling with overcapacity and weaker demand in any case, and is not well-positioned to withstand a lasting oil price shock.\n\nAir France KLM (PA: ) was the biggest faller, losing 4.0%, while discount flyer Wizz Air (LON: ) fell 2.8% and Lufthansa (DE: ) fell 2.6%. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (OL: ) was the outlier, rising 6.4% amid progress on restructuring two of its biggest bonds.\n\nOverall, markets took the news from the Middle East badly, and sentiment was hurt further by weak economic data out of China, where retail sales and fixed asset investment growth fell short of expectations and grew at the slowest pace since 2002, according to data compiled by Investing.com\n\nThe benchmark was down 0.6%, while the German fell by 0.7% and the Italian by 1.2%. Outperformers included the , which lost only 0.1%, and, of course, the Russian , which rose 1.3% on the prospect of the oil windfall.", "description": "StockBeat:  Saudi Attacks Mean Oil & Gas Gains, Airlines Pain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE9L0DN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
