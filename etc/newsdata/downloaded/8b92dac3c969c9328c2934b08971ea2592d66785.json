He \u201cnever emerged from those depths,\u201d Antoine shared the tragic news on her Facebook Page.\n\nThe water cabin is three stories with a sundeck on top and outside lounge area at sea level, and a bedroom below deck submerged 13 feet underwater.\n\nSwedish company Genberg Underwater Hotels built the floating room, held up by anchoring lines, 820 feet away from the coast of Pemba Island: \"Sleep happily under the stars to the soft murmuring of the sea,\" Manta Resort describes of the cabin on its website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne night in the Underwater Room costs around $1,700 a night for two people (a minimum stay of three nights is required), and it's anchored in water around 32 feet deep. The cabin has also been described as an experience for \"both divers and non-divers.\" The underwater cabin is part of a larger resort.\n\nThere are two large windows where Weber can be seen in a video Antoine posted on Facebook holding the note that read: \u201cI can\u2019t hold my breath long enough to tell you everything I love about you but everything I love about you I love more every day.\u201d Weber then flipped over the note to the proposal: \u201cWill you please be my wife. Marry me?\u201d He then pulled out a ring before swimming out of sight.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what happened after that. Manta Resort did not immediately return a request for comment. The resort told the BBC that Weber \u201ctragically drowned while free diving along outside the underwater room\u201d on Thursday, with the resort\u2019s CEO, Matthew Saus adding: \u201ceveryone is shaken to the core\u201d by Weber\u2019s death.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The underwater cabin where a Louisiana man stayed before drowning to his death while proposing to girlfriend in Tanzania.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/manta-resort-Instagram.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
