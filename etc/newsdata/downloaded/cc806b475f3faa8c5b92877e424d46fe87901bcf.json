Today the market is the market. You cannot judge the player because you paid some kind of amount. He [Ndombele] played two years in Lyon and moved to England where everything is new, but the quality is there. They need time to show their real quality.\u201d", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino has said that Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s new signings will need at least 18 months, or even two years, before they can regularly produce their best football for the club.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000213905540-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7L-uOufapAOhHGD8TnCnFOE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
