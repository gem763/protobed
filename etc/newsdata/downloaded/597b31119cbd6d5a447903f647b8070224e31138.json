By the early 2000s, they started rocking more tailored dresses and suits that showed off their toned figures.\n\nBut the one constant is that they\u2019ve never been able to keep their hands off each other. (Well, that and they\u2019ve both always had enviable heads of hair.)\n\n\u201cWhen he walks into a room, I\u2019m still \u2015 I mean, my heart gets a little fluttery and I think, \u2018Oh! He\u2019s so cute. He\u2019s so hot.\u2019 That\u2019s literally the first thing I think,\u201d Sedgwick told Redbook in 2012. \u201cYou can ask people on the set \u2014 it\u2019s palpable. He\u2019s still a mystery to me. And getting older together is scary and exciting.\u201d\n\nThe couple met while filming the 1988 TV movie \u201cLemon Sky,\u201d but actually crossed paths briefly a decade earlier. They married on Sept. 4, 1988 and went on to have two kids: a son, Travis, and a daughter, Sosie. Since then, Bacon and Sedgwick have been vocal about their lasting love and deep respect for each other.\n\n\u201cBeing with Kyra is so natural for me. It\u2019s the easiest aspect of my life,\u201d Bacon previously told Good Housekeeping. \u201cI know that I don\u2019t need a beach or room service to be happy.\u201d\n\nBelow, check out the couple\u2019s style evolution and some of their sweetest PDA moments:", "description": "The actor couple, who have been married 31 years, met while filming the 1988 TV movie \u201cLemon Sky.\"", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Huffpost Life"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cf86e2100003107ac755a.jpeg?cache=AEiAABlqi5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
