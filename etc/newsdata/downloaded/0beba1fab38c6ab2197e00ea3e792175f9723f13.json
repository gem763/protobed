But Bairstow had been biding his time, and Sam Billings \u2013 T20 vice-captain on this tour in the absence of Jos Buttler \u2013 gave him lively company in a fourth-wicket stand of 61.\n\nEngland chased 173 to beat a New Zealand Cricket XI in their first Twenty20 warm-up match\n\nSomerset's Tom Banton was one of three making their representative debuts in the warm-up\n\nWith captain Eoin Morgan giving the youngsters in his side a chance to finish the job, Curran came in at No 6 and didn't lose anything in comparison with the clean-striking Bairstow. Morgan has a slightly stiff back, but England insisted it wasn't a concern.\n\nEarlier, Morgan had his first look at the two other newcomers, Saqib Mahmood and Pat Brown after winning the toss and choosing to bowl. Mahmood looked lively, and had his figures dented only at the end, as Josh Clarkson hit his last two balls of the innings for six to leave him with an analysis of 4-0-35-0.\n\nBrown, meanwhile, was not helped by some slipshod fielding by his fellow debutant. Mahmood twice put down straightforward chances at long-leg off his bowling, and not until Brown's final delivery \u2013 when Banton held a tougher catch at deep midwicket to see off Christian Leopard \u2013 did he take his first wicket in England colours. Figures of 4-0-39-1 did not flatter him.\n\n'There were a few things we'll want to clean up with our performance, but that's the whole point of practice games,' said Bairstow.\n\nEncouragingly for England, leg-spinner Adil Rashid looked on top of his game after his first bowl since the World Cup, taking two for 25 after hard-hitting half-centuries from Anton Devcich and Anaru Kitchen.\n\nThe second warm-up game takes place here on Tuesday, before the first of five T20 internationals in Christchurch on Friday.", "description": "LAWRENCE BOOTH IN LINCOLN: At one stage, he hit left-arm wrist-spinner Blake Coburn for three successive sixes on a day when the only thing likely to blow the tourists off course was a gale.", "authors": ["Lawrence Booth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/08/20237342-0-image-a-2_1572164817158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
