Its ratings grew each season and, when it launched on Netflix, it really became popular.\n\n\u201cI love that Fox went after it because you have to do something as syndication is slipping,\u201d Bill Hague, executive vice president of Frank N. Magid Associates\u2019 Media Strategy Group, said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lack of quality sitcoms. We work closely with the CBC, and this is a great show off of their network, but nobody\u2019s really seen it, so I think it\u2019s really interesting. I think shows like this who haven\u2019t had the wide distribution of a Big 4 network (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX) run, it will be interesting to see if it finds an audience, but I think it should.\n\nIts expanding popularity on Netflix is similar to how \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d was essentially new content to viewers on the streaming service after both shows had dismal ratings in their runs on NBC.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cI think this opens the door to more deals like this \u2013 (shows from) smaller channels, streaming, and people putting them into domestic distribution,\" says Hague. \"I honestly believe this the platinum age of television. There is so much great quality TV \u2013 sitcoms, dramas, documentaries \u2013 so, there\u2019s all this great product out there, why shouldn\u2019t it find its way back to local broadcast television? People will be curious. The marketing plan should be interesting, and I think people are hungry for a good situation comedy. There\u2019s just nothing else out there; there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s popped since \u2018The Big Bang Theory.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d returns for its sixth and final season on Pop TV and Canada\u2019s CBC in January 2020, which will bring its episode count to 80, which is worthy of syndication in this era.\n\nHague sees the show being completed as an advantage for the show. \u201cThe windowing is interesting. It\u2019s done this year, it will premiere next year; it will still be contemporary. You can binge it, you can DVR it.\u201d\n\nThe comedy, which is produced by the Canadian network CBC and Pop, was created by and stars Eugene Levy and Daniel Levy. It follows the travails of a wealthy family who suddenly find themselves broke and forced to live in Schitt\u2019s Creek, a small town they once bought for a laugh.\n\nIt centers on an outrageously wealthy video store magnate, Johnny Rose, played by Eugene Levy; his wife Moira, a former soap-star, who is played by Catherine O\u2019Hara; and their two adult children \u2013 David, who calls himself the black sheep of the family (Daniel Levy) and career socialite Alexis (Annie Murphy).\n\nWith their luxurious lives in the past, they struggle to find jobs and relationships, and most importantly, figure out what it means to be a family in the makeshift but loveable town they\u2019ve reluctantly come to call home.\n\n\"I honestly believe this the platinum age of television. There is so much great quality TV \u2013 sitcoms, dramas, documentaries \u2013 so, there\u2019s all this great product out there, why shouldn\u2019t it find its way back to local broadcast television? \" - Bill Hague, Executive Vice President, Magid\n\nThis syndication deal is coming on the heels of the show earning four Emmy nominations this year for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Eugene Levy, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Catherine O\u2019Hara and Outstanding Contemporary Costumes.\n\nFrank Cicha, Executive Vice President of Programming for FOX Television Stations, said, \u201cProgram? What program? I thought Debmar was actually selling us the town!\u201d\n\nThere will be a big opening for \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d to gain an audience in either the late-night window or, quite possibly, into daytime, where the offerings are mostly talk shows.\n\n\u201cLocal TV, you know, we love local news, but there\u2019s only so much news you can put on the air.\u201d Hague said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put something on there. Talk shows are having a tough time, game shows are having a tough time, and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s real breakout, so the tried-and-true sitcom with a proven cast that hasn\u2019t necessarily been seen everywhere, I think is really interesting.\"\n\nThis shows that programs can come full circle, that while streaming is the big thing now, television still reigns supreme.", "description": "Schitt's Creek started on a small TV channel, built its audience on streaming, and now will be syndicated.
