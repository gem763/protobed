(Photo by Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News via Getty Images)\n\nIn July, halfway through a season that would end up smashing all previous records for home runs, commissioner Rob Manfred addressed the BBWAA at the All-Star Game in Cleveland to essentially concede that the ball was different without conceding intent. He assured writers that the league was gaining \u201ca good handle on what's going on in the manufacturing process.\u201d\n\nI wonder whether Manfred realized that this wasn\u2019t the sort of reassurance that would put the issue to bed. In fact, far from it. Copping to a level of control, or even just awareness, would only invite further questions. Or, as I wrote at the time, \u201cNow that we can track with pinpoint precision the impact that the ball\u2019s manufacturing has on the on-field product, the conversation is only beginning.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nI don\u2019t bring that up now for the sake of taking a victory lap but rather to emphasize that even after predicting as much, I am in awe of how quickly everyone noticed something is up with the balls this October.\n\n(Yahoo illustration/Amber Matsumoto)\n\nIn that press conference, Manfred promised a future in which \u201cwe don't have to wait until May\u201d to start asking if inconsistencies in the ball are impacting the home run rate. Turns out, he wildly overestimated how long it would take observers to go from speculation to confirmation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore all four division series had wrapped, baseball writers and fans noticed an uptick in fly balls that seemed to die at the warning track, started publicizing their theories and suspicions, and, thanks to Rob Arthur at Baseball Prospectus, were given statistical proof that the aerodynamic drag on the ball had shot up in October, resulting in far fewer home runs than anticipated. All that took a matter of days, during which there were fewer games (but still a statistically significant number of pitches thrown, which is how Arthur tracks drag) than there would be during a regular-season week.\n\n(I should clarify that none of this is \u201cunfair,\u201d per se. So long as both teams are using balls with comparable specifications, complaints about how the Dodgers might have won if Will Smith\u2019s long fly ball had traveled a few feet further do more to highlight how precarious any advantage in baseball is than they do to undermine the sanctity of a given game.)\n\nIn response to Arthur\u2019s study, Major League Baseball issued a statement that the postseason balls were pulled from the same batches as the admittedly extra juicy regular-season balls.\n\nBREAKING: MLB issues statement on baseballs used in postseason. \u201cBalls that are used in the Postseason are pulled from the same batches as balls used in the regular season.... only difference is the stamp placed on the ball.\u201d Additional comments: pic.twitter.com/SX9NqfykiY \u2014 Maury Brown (@BizballMaury) October 10, 2019\n\nThat is a tautologically unsatisfying response because the drag on the ball is different and it does appear to be having a material impact on the game. MLB is failing to engage with the issue at hand when they respond with an insistence that they didn\u2019t do anything nefarious. Culpability is intriguing, especially as it relates to whatever is at the root of the change, but MLB (which has a large ownership stake in the Rawlings production company) doesn\u2019t get to be done talking about how the baseballs are different or abdicate responsibility for it by releasing a pat statement saying that it expected the balls to be the same.\n\nFor his part, Manfred told Forbes in September that he reconvened the same panel that previously studied the ball and expected a new report on what happened this year shortly after the World Series. That was before the October spike in drag and it\u2019ll be interesting to see if this forthcoming report addresses the recent aberration. Without specifying what kind of changes baseball might pursue, Manfred said they\u2019re working toward \u201ca more predictable, consistent performance from the baseball.\u201d\n\nI wonder if he knows whether that\u2019s possible. Predictable, maybe. But consistent?\n\nAnalysis of the home run rate both this year and especially this postseason has bemoaned the sudden and extreme volatility, but while the change is certainly more sudden and more extreme \u2014 as Arthur and others like Dr. Meredith Wills have shown \u2014 I\u2019m not convinced that the ball being volatile is.\n\nEither MLB is changing the ball on purpose or else it can\u2019t control it. If it\u2019s the latter, Occam's Razor should tell you which one is more likely: that we\u2019re worse at making consistent baseballs than ever before or that we\u2019re better at studying them precisely.\n\nStatcast and suspicious spikes in home runs have beget a generation of fans and commentators who are trained to look for anything that feels like a marked shift in how batted balls are traveling in the air, and who have established a method of analyzing the physical ball\u2019s role in that shift. This past week has been a testament to just how quickly that perceptiveness can take root and turn into a meaningful revelation that the league has to be prepared to contend with.\n\nMLB is promising future consistency while also chalking up the inconsistency this postseason to normal fluctuations. Opacity at this point is just frustrating. In order to reconcile those things, the league should get on the side of engaging with this data, embracing revelations, admitting when something has changed, and ultimately being more transparent overall about how much consistency we can expect from the baseballs.\n\nOtherwise we\u2019re in for a lot more think pieces.\n\nNotes from the clubhouse\n\nIn the decisive Game 5 of the ALDS that saw the Houston Astros handily advance past the Tampa Bay Rays, sign-stealing \u2014 and particularly the Astros\u2019 well-documented history of doing so legally and illegally \u2014 was suspected to be part of how they jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning off Tyler Glasnow. He addressed those concerns after the game, with a nod toward specifically what kind of sign-stealing would be acceptable:\n\n\u201cI think how the game is today, a lot of teams are concerned [about sign-stealing]. I think that\u2019s part of the game, too, if you can steal signs at second, that\u2019s part of the game. We have ways to combat that.\u201d\n\nHmm.\n\nNotes from the stands\n\nLast week, I asked you to tell me about which individual player you want to see succeed this postseason and I\u2019m sorry that some of you are already sorely disappointed:\n\nIt has to be Dobnak at this point \u2014 Kazuto Yamazaki (@Kazuto_Yamazaki) October 7, 2019\n\nKershaw and Juan Soto\n\n\n\nKershaw bc playoff failures will unfairly follow him and mask that he was the probably best pitcher of this generation\n\n\n\nSoto bc he is too good and fun to be so unknown \u2014 Dr Matthew Ferari (@matt_ferari) October 7, 2019\n\nKershaw \u2014 he \u2018deserves\u2019 a ring and needs to get rid of the \u2018choke in postseason\u2019 reputation. \u2014 Steven Falkenhagen (@StevenFalk) October 7, 2019\n\nKershaw because he's so good during the regular season I'd like to see him pitch that well during the playoffs. \u2014 Vineeth Pillai (@vineethpi11ai) October 7, 2019\n\nKershaw. Easy guy to root for. Great career. Love to see him get a ring and pitch well \u2014 Sons of Lou Brown (@SonsofLouBrown) October 7, 2019\n\nAt least this means that the \u201cKershaw\u201d fans don\u2019t have to change their answer for next year?\n\nA little love for the old guys getting their last chance:\n\nCC because this is it for him. Honorable mention to the Braves and Cards managers for being baseball lifers getting a shot at a WS this late in their careers. \u2014 Matt (@MurderersRoBoat) October 7, 2019\n\nYadier Molina \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7, 16 yrs in the big league\n\n...his time is running out \u2014 bmc0792 (@beerninja70) October 7, 2019\n\nIf Twins win, they'll all still be in tomorrow. I, as objective Met fan, would enjoy seeing Zimmerman do well and get his just desserts. He's Nat's equivalent of Wright in what he means to fans / team. \u2014 DSFPhotography (David Friedner) (@DsfPhotography) October 8, 2019\n\nAnd the young guys, who have changed a team\u2019s fortune with their ascendance \u2026\n\nJuan Soto. Specifically for him to come up with more go ahead runs. Like everyone thought Bruce (not even correcting the typo) Harper was The Prince Who Was Promised but oops I guess prophecies are ambiguously phrased for a reason. \u2014 Wookiee Of The Year (@WookieeOTY) October 7, 2019\n\nJuan Soto, want to hear more stories about his mother\u2019s cooking! \u2014 Ben - Amazon FC Ambassador \ud83d\udcbc (@Xtremebenjie) October 7, 2019\n\nJack Flaherty. One of the best 2nd halves in ball ever and cause he\u2019s key to the Cardinals post season success. \u2014 Chad Cognac (@Koneyak) October 8, 2019\n\n...and who piss off old columnists along the way.\n\nAcu\u00f1a because new york post \u2014 Will Exline (@WExline) October 7, 2019\n\nAcu\u00f1a because boomers \u2014 sad sports fan (@legsanity) October 7, 2019\n\nUltimately, people just really love dominant starting pitching:\n\nStrasburg! After all his early hype and promise, being held out of the 2012 playoffs and then the signing of Scherzer felt like a \"don't worry - *this* is our ace, you just uh do your best\" move, and this postseason would be a huge opportunity for him to be **The Guy** \u2014 justin skell cousson (@justincousson) October 7, 2019\n\nJustin Verlander. To make the HOF case 100% irrefutable (which it already is, IMO) and to continue passing guys like Clemens in the postseason record books. And, because I just like him. \u2014 Eric (@PntGvn) October 7, 2019\n\nScherzer tonight - I love the attitude and presence he brings to the mound \u2014 Brian Murphy (@bmmurphy) October 8, 2019\n\nAnd it helps to be a sweetie.\n\nMichael Brantley! Such a sweetie and a great player. Miss him playing for the Tribe but glad he's doing well in Houston \u2014 Rachael Fox (@RachaelLFox) October 7, 2019\n\nIn the middle of October, especially if you\u2019re professionally obligated to follow along with the playoffs, the games can simultaneously start to run together and seem unparalleled in their specific drama. It feels like I\u2019ll never forget the dominance of Gerrit Cole or the quirkiness of a homer-ruled-double, but I wonder which of these moments and performances will actually transcend future seasons and so, for next week, tell me \u2014 hannah.keyser@yahoosports.com, or on Twitter \u2014 what you think was the most memorable postseason game you\u2019ve seen.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "With more technology at our disposal, the baseball's volatility and its effect on the game is constantly noticeable.", "authors": ["Hannah Keyser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z_1JSyvxZEa1ac1Z.c3blA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDAuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q38pEFZPQs_uNchApQ6ZVA--~B/aD0yMTA5O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/fd6e86a0-ec62-11e9-9b37-7b793c3c9cdd", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
