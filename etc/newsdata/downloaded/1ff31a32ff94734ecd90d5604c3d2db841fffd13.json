He's being closely monitored. Jonathan took a knock on the knee, he's being monitored,\" Gatland told reporters.\n\n\"A few of the backs are sore and bruised as you'd expect, but apart from that, the forwards are in pretty good health.\"\n\nGatland said he was hopeful that Davies would be fit for the quarter-final, which will be against France if Wales win and top the pool, while Biggar was feeling \"good in himself\".\n\nCentre Hadleigh Parkes and winger Josh Adams are the only two players who will back up after starting against Fiji.\n\n\"(Winger) George North has a sore ankle, we wanted to rest (fullback) Liam Williams,\" said Gatland.\n\n\"Two players are backing up. Ideally we'd have given Josh a rest and that hasn't been the case.\"\n\nWith lock Alun Wyn Jones also rested, flanker Justin Tipuric will captain his country for the first time in Kumamoto.\n\n\"We've got to make sure we do a job early on against Uruguay,\" said Gatland.\n\n\"It's challenging with such a short turnaround but that's what World Cups are all about.\n\n\"The squad is in a good place mentally. There are a group of players that are excited. We're expecting another tough game but also a good performance.\"\n\nTeam: 15-Leigh Halfpenny, 14-Josh Adams, 13-Owen Watkin, 12-Hadleigh Parkes, 11-Hallam Amos, 10-Rhys Patchell, 9-Aled Davies, 8-Aaron Wainwright, 7-Justin Tipuric (captain), 6-Aaron Shingler, 5-Adam Beard, 4-Bradley Davies, 3-Dillon Lewis, 2-Ryan Elias, 1-Nicky Smith\n\nReplacements: 16-Elliot Dee, 17-Rhys Carre, 18-Wyn Jones, 19-Jake Ball, 20-Ross Moriarty, 21-James Davies, 22-Tomos Williams, 23-Gareth Davies (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Karishma Singh/Peter Rutherford)", "description": "HAMAMATSU, Japan, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Wales coach Warren Gatland on Friday made 13 changes to his line-up for their final Pool D match against Uruguay with...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
