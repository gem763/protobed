We want makeup that\u2019s fun and that works. And I was always attracted to pro formulas that work super well but the packaging I love is like kid\u2019s packaging that you could find at a toy store. This combines both those things at a super-affordable price point. I met this girl at a meet-and-greet and she was wearing this bright pink lip and I said, \u201cWow, you do great makeup.\u201d She said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, I just wear bright colors and it looks like I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d \u201cStacy\u201d is a megawatt matte pink that you can easily apply with clean skin and look like you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nAnd we donate a portion of our sales to saving honeybees. Honeybees and honey are super-depleted because of the beauty industry. I think it\u2019s cool when a beauty brand can give back a little bit. We\u2019re actually working on vegan formulas for Trixie Cosmetics now. The New York Bee Sanctuary keeps inviting me to come see the hives when I\u2019m in New York, and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou can have the money, I don\u2019t want to get stung.\u201d", "description": "Trixie Mattel shares the things she can\u2019t live without, including her Urban Decay One And Done Hybrid Foundation, Total Care Zero Listerine, Gibson Hummingbird Guitar, Trixie Cosmetics Stacy Lipstick, Clorox Wipes, and MAC Gently Off Wipes.", "authors": ["Trixie Mattel", "Dominique Pariso"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/08/23/wiclw-trixie-mattel/23-trixie-mattel-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
