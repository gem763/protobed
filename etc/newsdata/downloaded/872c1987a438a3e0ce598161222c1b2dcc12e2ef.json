This trade war dance has been going on since the beginning of 2018 and has made markets rather volatile over the period. The FT had this to say in their morning email, \"Jaded observers will note that markets have been thoroughly whipsawed by the ebb and flow of US and China trade negotiations over the past 18 months. It's also worth noting that for the past 12 months the is up 3 per cent\".\n\n\n\nThe key to navigating these rough waters is to keep your eye on the goal ahead, which is long term capital growth. For many of our clients, their money will be invested for decades; Trump's trade war will be a distant memory by the time you cash out. Even though the S&P 500 is only up 3% in the last 12-months, those clients who have regularly been adding, in general, have better returns thanks to dollar-cost averaging. The moral of the story is not to take politicians too seriously, think long term and add regularly.\n\n\n\nYesterday the closed up 1.04%, the S&P 500 closed up 1.30%, and the closed up 1.75%.\n\nOur 10c Worth\n\nOne thing, from Paul\n\n\n\nThe China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), is the state agency responsible for Internet affairs in that country. It also administers China's domain name registry, for sites ending in \".cn\". According to them, there are now 847 million mobile only internet users in China. That number is still growing fast.

The data shows that without the money coming in, there would be a foreign currency shortfall of around 10%. What that means in practical terms is that without these remittances, many emerging market currencies would collapse.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork\n\nIn South Africa for example, to send money back to another African country will cost you around 7% - 10%.

The office-sharing firm led by Adam Neumann which sells itself as a tech startup is now officially called The We Company. This business might just have to slash its valuation to less than half of the $47 billion of its last funding round.. The biggest loser here outside of the founders is Masayoshi Son's SoftBank and its many investors in its $100 billion Vision Fund which has plowed over $10 billion into WeWork, including the last cheque that gave the company a $47 billion price tag.So what is the new valuation that's potentially on the cards now? the company may go public at a valuation of as low as $20 billion, less than half the $47 billion I mentioned above.. After-all this is just another property company.WeWork has big structural issues such as funding a supposedly long-term business with very short-term leases, a business model that hasn't been tested through time.
