Did [she] say it was recommended by a relative?\u201d Kim replied, \u201cI think she said she was operating it. So I was a bit surprised by that part.\u201dKim also implied in the KBS interview that PE was basically owned by the Cho family.On Tuesday, Rhyu revealed excerpts of his own interview with Kim on his podcast show, saying their conversation was held five days earlier on Oct. 3.In that show, Kim told Rhyu that on Sept. 10 - when he was summoned by prosecutors for questioning after his interview with KBS earlier that day - he saw a chat window in a program or app on a computer. The message read, \u201cHe had an interview with KBS. Minister Cho Kuk is said to have gone to [his] house so dig in.\u201dRhyu accused KBS of leaking their interview with Kim to prosecutors and later said in a different podcast that Kim was misrepresented.KBS immediately denied this and said in a statement that it \u201cchecked with the prosecution\u201d before its reports were aired \u201cto verify whether Kim\u2019s testimony corresponded with factual evidence,\u201d but \u201cdid not provide the contents of the interview to anyone inside the prosecution.\u201dOn Wednesday, the JoongAng Ilbo exclusively reported excerpts of Rhyu\u2019s interview with Kim that were edited out of the podcast, which included Kim\u2019s comments that contradicted what Justice Minister Cho said in his parliamentary confirmation hearing on Sept. 6.Rhyu released his full interview with Kim on Thursday, and KBS released its full interview as well on Friday.BY LEE SUNG-EUN, JEONG YONG-HWAN AND YOON SUNG-MIN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
