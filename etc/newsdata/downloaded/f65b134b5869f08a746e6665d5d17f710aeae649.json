The camera taught me to observe. And the bike taught me teamwork and competitiveness \u2013 I started racing when I was 12. My sister was eight years older than me; my brother 11 years older. I was sort of an only child.\n\nWe had a lovely family, but we weren\u2019t very worldly. We travelled in England: Dorset in the summer, weekends in Derbyshire. I came home once and said, \u201cDad, I really like Jacques Anquetil,\u201d the famous French cyclist, and my father said, \u201cWhat are those words?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never been a reader. We never really had books in the house. And I\u2019m dyslexic, so I\u2019m not good at concentrating. It would have been nicer to have had a better education. I left school at 15, and I was really not very good at school. I can\u2019t even remember going to school.\n\nDo I feel old? I went to buy a croissant recently and they wouldn\u2019t take money from me. Only plastic. That made me feel 194 years old.\n\nAnybody who says they don\u2019t mind getting older is telling porky pies. Of course you mind. Your body deteriorates. You ache and ache. You\u2019re nearer the dreaded day. Luckily I\u2019ve still got the legs of a teenager.\n\nI\u2019m a happy person. I\u2019m very optimistic. Every day is a new beginning. I don\u2019t get depressed. I get disappointed by behaviour, mainly with all the madness going on in the world. Politics. Dictatorships.\n\nWe\u2019re divided at the moment. So much of that is because populist leaders say things people want to hear. \u201cI\u2019m going to open 400 schools and they\u2019ll all be free!\u201d Obviously that\u2019s not true. But so many people believe them.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my wife Pauline since I was 21. We\u2019ve been together since 1967. What\u2019s the secret? Give and take. Learning to listen. Learning to be interested and interesting. Fun. A good sense of humour. No big egos. Just normalness, really.\n\nI\u2019m well known in certain circles, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m famous. I\u2019m not impressed by fame or money. To put it another way: what\u2019s the thing I\u2019m most pleased with about the business? Continuity \u2013 always being relevant.\n\nPauline\u2019s the cook and she\u2019s a great cook. I mean, I can rustle things up \u2013 toast, beans on toast. But really I\u2019m head of washing up and cleaning the surfaces.\n\nNext year is the 50th anniversary of Paul Smith. The fact we\u2019re still here, still independent, still doing OK\u2026 Think of how many bands you were into that don\u2019t exist any more. How many brands. How many little caf\u00e9\u2019s you used to go to that aren\u2019t there any more. But Paul Smith, we\u2019re still here. It\u2019s very beautiful.\n\nThe Adventures of Moose and Mr Brown by Paul Smith, illustrated by Sam Usher, is published on 24 October by Pavilion, priced \u00a312.99.
