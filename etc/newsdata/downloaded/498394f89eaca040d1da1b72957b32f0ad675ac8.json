A year and a half ago, however, Mr. Atwood got an Instagram message from a celebrity stylist proposing a new kind of client: specifically, Post Malone, a 24-year-old rapper with face tattoos. Mr. Atwood was unsure\u2014he didn\u2019t know who Post Malone was. As he searched YouTube, up popped a video of the rapper with about 300 million views. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is obviously somebody that I needed to pay attention to,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Atwood who runs his label Union Western with co-designer Joe Walters.\n\nMr. Atwood got to work and, in October 2018, Mr. Malone sauntered down the red carpet at the American Music Awards in Los Angeles in Union Western\u2019s creation: a teal blue suit with leopard-spotted snakes crawling up the sides and rhinestones embellishments stretching down the legs.\n\nA year later, fashion is still bullish on embellishment. And sensational embroidered suits, of the kind that Gene Autry once wore, are having a renaissance. At MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards last month in Newark, N.J., the electronic artist Diplo wore a suit slathered with decorative mushrooms and psychotropic chemical compounds, while \u201cOld Town Road\u201d rapper Lil Nas X donned a cherry-red number embroidered with bucking broncos and mystical \u201cthird eyes.\u201d They were made, respectively, by Fort Lonesome, a 9-year-old Austin, Tex.-based outfit and Union Western. These two labels, along with Rose Cuts of Los Angeles, are resurrecting the so-called \u201cNudie suit\u201d for a contemporary clientele.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think of this style of suits? Must have or pass, and why? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe original Nudie was Nudie Cohn, an Eastern European immigrant who whipped up heavily embroidered \u201cwestern\u201d suits in the early-to-mid 20th century. Following in the footsteps of earlier western tailors Nathan Turk and Bernard Lichtenstein (known as Rodeo Ben), Mr. Cohn opened shop in Hollywood, Calif., in the late 1940s. \u201cNudie became really the most well-known of them because he was very outgoing. He really knew how to market himself,\u201d said Holly George-Warren, a music writer who is working on a documentary about Mr. Cohn\u2019s life called \u201cRhinestone Cowboy,\u201d set to be released next year. He drove a custom Pontiac Bonneville with \u201cNudie\u201d emblazoned on the spare tire rack, attended concerts in his spotlight-stealing suits and designed countless outfits for some of music\u2019s biggest names.\n\nInitially, \u201cNudie suits\u201d (as any suit of this style would come to be called) were donned by country kingpins like Roy Rogers and Hank Williams Sr., but the appeal crossed genres. Elton John wore a rose-embroidered suit on the cover of his 1972 single \u201cRocket Man.\u201d Jerry Garcia wore a skeleton-embroidered blazer while performing in 1973. And Sly Stone sported a rhinestone studded get-up on the \u201cMike Douglas Show\u201d in 1974. \u201cWhat would happen is the look would start dying out among one [genre] group and then another group would take it up,\u201d explained Ms. George-Warren.\n\nNudie Cohn didn\u2019t invent embroidered westernwear, but through his masterful marketing, the suits came to be associated with his name.

In the world of personalized clothes, a custom Nudie suit is about as personal as it gets, allowing a customer to not only pick out the fabric and shape, but specify which characters and slogans get stitched across it as well.\n\nEach suit reflects the customer\u2019s specific tastes and demands. Ms. Pierce often applies customer\u2019s zodiac signs or a favorite animal onto the suits she designs. About 40% of her business consists of non-famous, yet eccentric, folks who want something special for their wedding.\n\nThe other 60% of Ms. Pierce\u2019s customer base are musicians or performers, reflecting the music world\u2019s decades-long love affair with Nudie suits. \u201cThere\u2019s a very symbiotic relationship between flashy clothing and people who perform on stage,\u201d said Kathie Sever, the owner of Fort Lonesome, who has been making embroidered western wear for about 20 years. As Joe Walters, the other half of Union Western, explained, \u201cthe flashy embellished western wear that Nudie and Turk made is the original bling,\u201d which might explain its appeal to cocksure rappers like Lil Nas X and Post Malone.\n\nRose Cut, a Los Angeles based outfit, is one of a few upstart westernwear companies that have thrust Nudie suits back into the limelight.\n\nToday, these far-out suits have a potent psychedelic appeal. \u201cWhat is happening right now is informed far more by a Gram Parsons vibe than\u2026.a Roy Rogers vibe,\u201d said Ms. Sever, referring to the notorious suit embroidered with a marijuana leaf that country singer Gram Parsons wore on the cover of the Flying Burrito Brothers\u2019 1969 album \u201cThe Gilded Palace of Sin.\u201d The suit Fort Lonesome made for Diplo, stitched with the chemical compounds of drugs like DMT and MDMA, and \u201cLSD\u201d embroidered down the sleeves, could be seen as the descendant of Mr. Parsons\u2019s outfit.", "description": "Heavily embroidered \u2018Nudie\u2019 suits, a favorite of Gene Autry and singing cowboys, have again found an audience with bold grooms and rappers like Lil Nas X and Post Malone.", "authors": ["Jacob Gallagher", "Jacob.Gallagher Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105306/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
