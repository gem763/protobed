Stars, galaxies, and a planet.\n\n\u201cMany of these stars are confined to the grand arch that runs across the image, an arch that is the central plane of our home Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n\u201cInside the arch is another galaxy - the neighboring Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Stars that are individually visible include Antares on the far left and Sirius on the far right.\n\n(Image: Xiaohua Zhao)\n\n\u201cThe planet Jupiter shines brightly just below Antares.\u201d\n\nThe beautiful photo was snapped in April, and is composed of 15 vertical frames taken consecutively over 10 minutes.\n\nThe Uyuni Salt Flats attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year, many of who take advantage of the reflective surface to take clever snaps.\n\nNational Geographic explained: \u201cBolivia\u2019s Salar de Uyuni is considered one of the most extreme and remarkable vistas in all of South America, if not Earth.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cStretching more than 4,050 square miles of the Altiplano, it is the world\u2019s largest salt flat, left behind by prehistoric lakes evaporated long ago.\n\n\u201cHere, a thick crust of salt extends to the horizon, covered by quilted, polygonal patterns of salt rising from the ground.\n\n\u201cAt certain times of the year, nearby lakes overflow and a thin layer of water transforms the flats into a stunning reflection of the sky.\u201d", "description": "The beautiful image was snapped by photographer Jheison Huerta, and has been featured as NASA\u2019s Astronomy Picture of the Day", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Jheison Huerta", "Xiaohua Zhao"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671208.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MilkyWaySaltFlat_Huerta_2048.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
