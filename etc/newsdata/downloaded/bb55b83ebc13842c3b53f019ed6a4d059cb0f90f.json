Last night Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018Barry Coppinger has consistently failed the people of Cleveland and its serving police officers \u2013 now he is actively undermining efforts to tackle drug addiction.\n\n\u2018It is not right for a commissioner who has failed so badly, and is stepping down in a matter of months, to make the Cleveland force area a guinea pig for an experimental new drugs policy when he won\u2019t even be around to face its consequences.\n\nThe scheme, the first of its kind in England, was created by under-fire Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure most right-thinking people would rather see the hundreds of thousands of pounds he is squandering on this spent on getting the basics right, by investing in frontline policing.\u2019\n\nInternal reports from Mr Coppinger\u2019s office reveal that the 15 people chosen to benefit from the pilot scheme are addicts with criminal records.\n\nEarly research found that 20 of the most hardcore addicts in the North East town \u2013 some of whom will now get free heroin in the project \u2013 had committed a total of 351 offences such as shoplifting in two years, \u2018costing society \u00a3784,890\u2019.\n\nMr Coppinger has said the trial will focus on long-term drug users \u2018for whom all other treatment has failed and who are known to be the most active criminals in the town as they look to finance their addiction\u2019.\n\nHe estimates the annual cost to the taxpayer \u2013 \u00a312,000 per addict \u2013 represents a saving to society. While removing the need for addicts to steal to buy drugs, it is hoped the project will \u2018finally get users off drugs, off the streets and back into society\u2019 while also freeing up NHS and police resources.\n\nThe PCC has provided \u00a3131,287 towards the scheme, with the rest coming from prisons, probation and public health budgets.\n\nHealthcare workers will supervise the addicts as they \u2018self-administer\u2019 diamorphine.\n\nThe project has already been agreed by the Home Office.\n\nThe Middlesbrough trial is expected to be followed by another in Darlington, run by neighbouring Durham Police.", "description": "Fifteen of the most prolific offenders in Middlesbrough will be able to inject the Class A drug three times a day at a special NHS clinic from this month.", "authors": ["Martin Beckford For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19348402-0-image-a-49_1570323480419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
