Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters after the briefing that he believes the details of the complaint\u2014which would normally be shared with Congress\u2014are being suppressed, either by President Trump himself or someone \u201cclose\u201d to him and \u201cabove the pay grade\u201d of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a problem of the law,\u201d Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said. \u201cThe problem lies elsewhere. And we\u2019re determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is, to make sure that the national security is protected and to make sure that this whistle-blower is protected.\u201d\n\nFellow House Intelligence member Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) told reporters after the whistleblower briefing that \u201cwe\u2019ve got a very grave situation on our hands. The standard that has to be met by the IG... urgent, is talking about fire, as he referred to it.\"\n\n\u201cThis whistleblower has done everything according to the book,\u201d Speier said. \u201cAnd the potential for reprisals for this whistleblower are great\u201d\n\nThe complaint in question, first filed with Atkinson\u2019s office in mid-August and reported by the Washington Post, reportedly concerns a \u201cpromise\u201d made while Trump was speaking with another world leader. In the five weeks preceding the complaint\u2019s filing, Trump had conversations with at least five foreign leaders, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, the emir of Qatar.\n\nLegally, such a complaint must involve mismanagement, waste, abuse, or a danger to intelligence operations or public safety, or relate to an intelligence activity that violates U.S. law.\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Sam Brodey.", "description": "Rep.
