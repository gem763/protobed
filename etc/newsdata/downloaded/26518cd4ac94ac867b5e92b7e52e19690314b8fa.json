But the \u201ccreepy and kooky, mysterious and spooky\u201d family actually started life as a series of satirical cartoons drawn by Charles Addams and published in The New Yorker between 1938 and 1988. The hook of the glossy new animated feature about the macabre family is that it returns to the look of those original Addams cartoons, capturing the tentacled train of Morticia\u2019s dress, Gomez\u2019s rotund figure, and Wednesday\u2019s oval face in perfect verisimilitude.\n\nYet even as animation veterans and Sausage Party co-directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan hark back to the origins of The Addams Family, they fail to capture the spirit that made the clan such a hit to begin with. Their take on The Addams Family isn\u2019t a scream, it\u2019s a painfully generic kids\u2019 film.\n\nLike most soft-pedaled children\u2019s movies, their Addams family makes a vague gesture toward a meaningful life lesson \u2014 in this case, a timely message about the importance of recognizing people\u2019s humanity, regardless of their differences. The film places the Addamses in the 21st century to comment on how witch hunts of old have transformed into paranoid online neighborhood watch groups. The morbid sensibility of the Addams family serves as a metaphor for any kind of otherness that prevents bigots from seeing their neighbors as equals. It\u2019s a welcome thematic centerpiece, one that almost achieves a genuine sense of poignancy. Unfortunately, The Addams Family is so bland, unfunny, and poorly structured that even the best intentions can\u2019t elevate it.\n\nAfter a brief prologue depicting the morose wedding of sophisticated Gomez Addams (Oscar Isaac) and his proudly icy bride Morticia (Charlize Theron), the film leaps ahead to the classic Addams Family status quo. Gomez and Morticia are happily ensconced in a ghoulish haunted house with their murderously deadpan daughter Wednesday (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) and their explosively dangerous son Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard). Loyal servants Lurch and Thing are there, too. And since Pugsley\u2019s impending \u201cSabre Mazurka\u201d \u2014 a sort of bar mitzvah-esque coming-of-age ceremony involving a sword dance \u2014 is set to bring the entire extended Addams family into town, Gomez\u2019s brother Fester (Nick Kroll) and his mother Grandmama (Bette Midler) show up early to help with the preparations.\n\nThe impending influx of Addamses dovetails with the second half of the plot, which involves a cookie-cutter subdivision that pops up just a stone\u2019s throw away from the Addams\u2019 mansion. The town of \u201cAssimilation\u201d (no points for subtly) is the brainchild of manically perky HGTV-eque designer Margaux Needler (Allison Janney), who plans to sell all 50 of its houses during a live TV special. She\u2019s worried that the dilapidated Addams manor is an eyesore that could scare away potential buyers. Gomez and Morticia, meanwhile, are nervous about venturing back into an outside world that has (literally) burned them before. (Though juxtaposing the macabre with the suburban has long been a cornerstone of The Addams Family mythos, there are times when this new film comes perilously close to feeling like a rip-off of the Hotel Transylvania franchise.)\n\nYet that\u2019s just one of the more than half a dozen subplots crammed into the film\u2019s 87-minute run time. The Addams Family doesn\u2019t feel like a singular narrative so much as a series of Saturday morning cartoons spliced together. The high point of the season would no doubt be \u201cThe One Where Wednesday Goes to Junior High.\u201d In the most interesting through line, Wednesday befriends Margaux\u2019s rebellious daughter Parker (Elsie Fisher) and takes an exploratory mission into the world of teenage girldom. The unlikely friendship inspires Parker to reject her mother\u2019s sunny aesthetic for something more emo, while Wednesday enacts her own form of teenage rebellion by embracing girlish conventionality.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun idea that briefly brings Wednesday and Morticia\u2019s mother / daughter relationship to the forefront in a way Sonnenfeld\u2019s films never did. There\u2019s even some intriguing queer subtext in Wednesday and Parker\u2019s relationship. But like most of the subplots in The Addams Family, Wednesday\u2019s storyline unceremoniously peters out. It\u2019s as if the film reaches its required runtime, then just gives up without resolving things.\n\nAnother big reason The Addams Family winds up feeling like a Saturday morning cartoon is because of the flat, weightless look of its animation. The visual highpoint comes in the opening moments, with a montage of Morticia\u2019s beauty routine that involves smearing her parents\u2019 ashes on herself as makeup. The rest of the film rarely matches that level of ghoulish creativity. Apart from the occasional clever detail, like the way Wednesday\u2019s pigtails loop into nooses, there isn\u2019t much personality in the way the characters are brought to life. The Addams Family looks more like a 1990s PC game than a big-budget feature.\n\nThe vocal performances are similarly lifeless. Few members of the impressively star-studded cast make any kind of impression. (There\u2019s probably a fraud case to be made over advertising Snoop Dogg as the voice of Cousin Itt, given that he only delivers a handful of vocally modulated lines, all in Itt\u2019s signature high-pitched gibberish.) Isaac, Theron, and Moretz are clearly trying their best, but they can\u2019t do much with a painfully unfunny script that relies heavily on cheap reference humor. In one characteristic moment, a cool visual involving a cavalcade of spiders is undercut by a lame one-liner about \u201csurfing the web.\u201d Even when the jokes aren\u2019t terrible, Vernon and Tiernan (working from a screenplay by The Christmas Chronicles\u2019 Matt Lieberman and Corpse Bride\u2019s Pamela Pettler) fail to create any kind of successful comedic timing.\n\nOnly Janney rises above the lackluster material to deliver a genuinely scene-stealing villainous turn. This isn\u2019t her first animated role (among other things, she voiced the anxious starfish in Finding Nemo), but she makes an effective case that she should be a regular in the medium. She knows how to give a performance big enough to cut through her character\u2019s plasticity. Still, there\u2019s an irony in coming away from an Addams Family story feeling like the normie villain is more memorable than the Addams tribe.\n\nTo be fair, The Addams Family isn\u2019t necessarily worse than a lot of the generic animated kids\u2019 fare that hits theaters these days. It just feels like a bigger disappointment than, say, The Secret Life of Pets 2, because other creators have done so much more with these characters. Though the film pulls its aesthetics from the original cartoons, The Addams Family is clearly a strategic attempt to reach a generation who were raised on the 1990s Sonnenfeld films, and now have kids of their own. But like Disney\u2019s live-action remakes of its animated classics, which target the same nostalgic audience, The Addams Family just serves as an argument for revisiting the originals instead.", "description": "The latest update on the macabre family from Charles Addams\u2019 comics features an all-star cast, with Oscar Isaac, Charlize Theron, Allison Janney, Bette Midler, Stranger Things\u2019 Finn Wolfhard, Nick Kroll, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, and Snoop Dogg all providing voices. But nothing about the film is distinctive, winning, or funny.", "authors": ["Caroline Siede", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EnGhaVqkA6gWG0OREzZrjQds7g=/0x0:4000x2094/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19276070/the_addams_family_TAF_TP_00004_rgb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
