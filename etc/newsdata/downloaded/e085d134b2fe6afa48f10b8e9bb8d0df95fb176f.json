A player can take a step if he is in the process of \u201cgathering\u201d a dribble or pass, then has two steps. Players such as James Harden have stretched that to the limit, frustrating opponents and non-Rockets fans, but it\u2019s legal.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThis is a legal play. Although James puts the ball behind his back, he only takes two steps after the gather of the ball and therefore it is NOT a travel. https://t.co/i1hU3b4zuQ \u2014 NBA Official (@NBAOfficial) October 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the NBA is looking to better define that \u201cgather\u201d step, then crackdown on enforcement of the rule. With that will come an education program for everyone from players to fans. All of this was approved at the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors\u2019 meeting in New York on Friday.\n\n\u201cOne of the most misunderstood rules in our game is how traveling is interpreted and appropriately called,\u201d Byron Spruell, NBA President, League Operations, said in a statement. \u201cRevising the language of certain areas of the rule is part of our three-pronged approach to address the uncertainty around traveling. This approach also includes an enforcement plan to make traveling a point of emphasis for our officiating staff, along with an aggressive education plan to increase understanding of the rule by players, coaches, media and fans.\u201d\n\nThat \u201caggressive education plan\u201d should be interesting.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the meeting, the owners also made gamblers everywhere happy by saying that starting lineups now need to be submitted by coaches 30 minutes prior to the start of the game. In past years that had been only 10 minutes (and road teams complained that was not evenly enforced between home and road teams all the time).\n\nThis is a good bit of transparency by the league, as have been some of the recent changes in requirements of announcing injuries. But make no mistake, this rule change is all about gambling.", "description": "Gather and two steps.
