Raskin: \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Have to Testify Because White House Corroborated Everything", "language": "en", "text": "On Monday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cLive,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said the whistleblower would not need to testify.\n\nAccording to Raskin, a contemporaneous memo created by the White House officials \u201ccorroborated everything that the whistleblower was saying.\u201d\n\nOn the witnesses that have testified already, Raskin said, \u201cAt this point, the critical thing is that all of the testimony is lining up. All of it corroborates the initial statement.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThere might be a few interpretive differences, but essentially everybody is telling us the same thing, which is the phone call was just the tip of the iceberg on July 25. What was underneath it was a very deliberate, premeditated strategy by the president of the United States to withhold $391 million in military and security assistance in order to shake down the Ukrainian government for the political favors he wanted, as well as for a number of other things that are starting to come out now.\u201d\n\nJackson asked, \u201cYou may have seen the president again this morning is calling on the whistleblower\u2019s identity to be revealed. I know there are some concerns with your colleagues in the Democratic side of the aisle about protecting that person\u2019s identity, and perhaps it sounds like that may mean this whistleblower not testifying at all. Do you need to hear from this whistleblower, and do you think this person will testify or not?\u201d\n\nRaskin said, \u201cFirst of all, the contemporaneous memo created by the White House officials corroborated everything that the whistleblower was saying. Everything that we\u2019ve learned about the withholding of the military aid also confirms what the whistleblower said and all of the evidence we\u2019ve heard from other witnesses.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThat\u2019s not the role of a whistleblower. Generally, what we try to do is protect whistleblowers. They\u2019re the ones who kind of blow the top off of a scheme, and then we have other witnesses come forward who are willing to state it on the record and are willing to be heard. So the fact that the president wants to expose the whistleblower is what the guilty parties always do. they try to go after the person who essentially reveals their plot to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of\u00a0MSNBC's \"Live,\"\u00a0Rep.
