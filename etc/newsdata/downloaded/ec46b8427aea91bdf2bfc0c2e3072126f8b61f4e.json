We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where security, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources can be the difference between success and failure.\"\n\nThis contract \u2013 known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract \u2013 is a 10-year contract to move the Department of Defense's database to the cloud.\n\nIt's a big loss for AWS, which drives profit for the entire Amazon empire.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Amazon's options might be after losing the contract. The bidding process for JEDI began more than one year ago, contenders like Oracle and IBM were eliminated from the process in April. One potential course of action available to Amazon might be to protest the decision through a \"request for reconsideration\" with the Government Accountability Office.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said his firm \"fully\" expects Amazon and other to challenge the decision in court. It's unclear at this time how a legal challenge might work.\n\nAmazon reported a less-than-expected profit in its third-quarter earnings on Thursday \u2014 $4.23 a share on revenue of $70 billion. AWS raked in $9 billion in revenue for the quarter and was responsible for nearly 72% of Amazon's total operating income over the period.\n\nAmazon Web Services still leads the cloud market and posted $2.3 billion more in sales growth over the past quarter than it did in the same period of 2018.", "description": "It's a surprise defeat to Amazon, and it's not clear what its options might be.", "authors": ["Benjamin Pimentel", "Ashley Stewart"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db38740dee01950f7343032?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
