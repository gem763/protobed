Who are we if our stomachs take care of digestion and our bodily functions take care of themselves?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Are we leading this ship, or is this ship leading us? Who knows?\u2019\n\nWho are we? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhy do we kiss? \ud83d\ude19\n\nWhy do cats lick us \ud83d\udc31 Things got deep with @RealChalamet on the Overthinkers Hotline \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/QI2652PH4g \u2014 BBC Radio 1 (@BBCR1) October 9, 2019\n\nGiven how much that made our heads hurt, we\u2019re going to say definitely not us.\n\nWhen next asked to discuss why people first kissed, Timothee philosophised: \u2018I would think it\u2019s because lips are the softest part of the body.\u2019\n\nBrains AND beauty (Picture: PIROSCHKA VAN DE WOUW/Reuters)\n\nNot that he would know, obvs.\n\nWhen Grimmy mused: \u2018Do we kiss because there\u2019s a need within us or does cinema just say that\u2019s what we should do? Maybe it is weird,\u2019 Timothee pointed out: \u2018[Dogs] do it with their noses.\u2019\n\nFinally, the duo discussed the question of whether cats lick us \u2018to take away the tastes of their own backsides,\u2019 with a thoughtful T-Chaz putting a lot of consideration into his answer.\n\n\u2018Whatever it is, it\u2019s always a bummer for them,\u2019 he finally concluded. \u2018I\u2019ve never seen a cat lick anyone\u2019s hand and go, \u201cOh, that was the right thing to do.\u201d It\u2019s always steeped in deep regret and weeks of pensive sorrow.\u2019\n\nIs this Timothee\u2019s way of saying that he can communicate with animals; is there anything this man can\u2019t do?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
