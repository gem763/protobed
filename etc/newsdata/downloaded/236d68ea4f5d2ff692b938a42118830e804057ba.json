We had chances, the header from Benzema especially.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t criticise my players over anything, I\u2019m annoyed for them above all, but I\u2019m happy with the game they played. They too are a bit disappointed not to take all the points.\u201d\n\nReal\u2019s Sergio Ramos and Atletico\u2019s Kieran Trippier were lucky to avoid bookings for cynical fouls on Felix and Eden Hazard respectively in a cagey opening.\n\nAtletico\u2019s club record signing Felix sneaked in behind Real\u2019s defence but dragged an effort across the face of goal before whistling another shot just wide towards the end of the first half.\n\nAt the other end, Oblak made one solid save to tip Toni Kroos\u2019s low drive around the post.\n\nBoth teams were more afraid of losing than hungry to win with a draw seemingly suiting both.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do (to get rid of) errors that we should not be committing, we have to keep working,\u201d said Atletico coach Diego Simeone.\n\nRelated Coverage Resurgent Real Madrid show defensive progress in derby draw\n\n\u201cIn the first half we had more of the play but we couldn\u2019t finish any of our chances. In the second. Oblak made that save from Benzema\u2019s header. It was a hard-fought game, we both lacked what you need to win a game.\u201d\n\nAfter a shaky start to the season and a 3-0 thrashing by Paris St Germain in the Champions League, Zidane has steadied the ship with wins over Sevilla, Osasuna and now a draw with a direct title rival.\n\nReal Sociedad, who are fifth, could displace Real at the top with a win over Sevilla on Sunday.", "description": "Real Madrid earned a 0-0 draw at neighbours Atletico Madrid in a tight derby to stay top of La Liga on Saturday, continuing their recovery after a disappointing start to the season.", "authors": ["Rik Sharma", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434989832&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0RQ", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
