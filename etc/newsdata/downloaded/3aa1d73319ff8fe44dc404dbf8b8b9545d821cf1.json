(Image: Disney)\n\nOscar Isaac says to expect some Poe Dameron backstory in The Rise of Skywalker. Aladdin\u2019s producer is still discussing a sequel to the live-action remake. Derek Kolstad has some goofy ideas about where John Wick could go next. Rebecca Sugar says that Steven Universe will continue after The Movie. Plus, what\u2019s to come on The Flash. Spoilers now!\n\nNew Mutants\n\nSalt shakers at the ready, my X-men, because according to FandomWire, the latest cut of New Mutants removes all references to Fox\u2019s \u201cSingerverse\u201d of X-films, as well as any and all mention of its characters being \u201cmutants\u201d of any kind. The outlet alleges that these seemingly bonkers decisions were made \u201cin case Kevin Feige decides later he wants to bring The New Mutants into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\u201d\n\nRod Serling\n\nThe latest issue of Production Weekly reveals Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko, Southland Tales, The Box) is set to write and direct a biopic on the life of The Twilight Zone creator, Rod Serling.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nIn a recent interview with ET Canada, J.J. Abrams stated the events of The Last Jedi \u201cdidn\u2019t really derail\u201d his plans for Episode IX.\n\nThe story that we\u2019re telling, the story that we started to conceive when we did The Force Awakens, was allowed to continue. Episode VIII didn\u2019t really derail anything that we were thinking about.\n\nOscar Isaac also revealed to the outlet The Rise of Skywalker would delve heavily into Poe\u2019s past.\n\nParticularly with Poe, I think people will be surprised to see that he has a bit more of an ambiguous past. He\u2019s not just kind of that squeaky-clean flyboy.\n\nAladdin 2\n\nSpeaking with Screen Rant, Aladdin producer Dan Lin revealed Disney is now \u201cstudying\u201d Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the original film\u2019s second direct-to-video sequel after Return of Jafar.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days. We never designed the movie to tell the Return of Jafar story, frankly. We were focused on telling the best movie possible. Now, we\u2019re studying Jafar and the Thieves movie that came out, as well. We\u2019re looking at that, but it\u2019s still early days. We\u2019re talking about different storylines. What we\u2019re talking about is not going to be a direct remake of any sequel that\u2019s come out, the same way that our movie was not a direct remake of the first movie. We studied the original movie and saw what worked and what things we wanted to update, and if we\u2019re lucky enough to make another movie, we will do that as well. But it\u2019s not going to be a remake of any specific DVD sequel. It\u2019ll be a new story.\n\nJohn Wick 4\n\nIn a Q&A moderated by Discussing Film, John Wick creator Derek Kolstad joked that the character will head into outer space for his fourth feature outing.\n\n\u201cSpace. I mean, come on. It is the fourth one after all.\u201d - Derek Kolstad https://t.co/a8Zou6eta2 \u2014 DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) August 30, 2019\n\nFast & Furious 9\n\nCharlize Theron has our first look at Cipher as she appears in Fast & Furious 9.\n\nEncounter\n\nAn alien bivalve attaches itself to Luke Hemsworth in the first trailer for Encounter, coming to VOD in October.\n\nScooby-Doo! Return to Zombie Island\n\nMeanwhile, the Scooby gang find melting zombies in the latest clip from Return to Zombie Island.\n\nSteven Universe\n\nSpeaking with TV Line, creator Rebecca Sugar confirmed the movie is \u201cnot the end\u201d of the Steven Universe franchise.\n\nThe movie is not the end. There is more. That\u2019s all I can say at the moment, but there will be more, and everything that happened up to this point will continue to matter in true Steven Universe fashion.\n\nThe Flash\n\nAlso speaking with TV Line, showrunner Eric Wallace revealed there is a \u201cfun\u201d reason Iris enjoys a curly new hairdo in the fifth episode of season six.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason her hair is that way in the story, and it has to do with fun, and Iris just being herself, and letting the character show more sides of who she is. It\u2019s also about letting Candice show more sides of who she is as a person and as an actress, which is something I support 100 per cent. I love her hair that way. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it more than once that way this season.\n\nKilljoys\n\nSpoiler TV has synopses for \u201cTerraformance Anxiety\u201d and \u201cLast Dance,\u201d the final two episodes of Killjoys.\n\nTerraformance Anxiety The Lady\u2019s terraforming plans are becoming a reality, as the Killjoy trio scramble to find a way to defeat her. Last Dance Dutch uses Khlyen to bait The Lady and finds herself in the midst of a final, epic showdown.\n\nThe Outpost\n\nMeanwhile, Janzo continues his search for the Plagueling cure in the synopsis for \u201cNothing Short of Heroic,\u201d airing September 20 in the U.S.\n\nGarret (Jake Stormoen) runs into Talon (Jessica Green), now a Prime Order captive as Gwynn\u2019s (Imogen Waterhouse) lost relation has a claim to the throne. Meanwhile, Janzo (Anand Desai-Barochai) becomes desperate to find a plagueling cure. Lastly, a devastating Prime Order weapon is revealed. The episode was written by Jason Faller & Kynan Griffin and directed by Kurt Knight (#211). Original airdate 9/19/2019.\n\n[Spoiler TV]\n\nPandora\n\nFinally, Ralen faces trial in the synopsis for \u201cHurricane,\u201d episode 10 of Pandora.\n\nRalen (Ben Radcliffe) is on trial for his life after being accused of having sabotaged the Tereshkova. But even Jax (Priscilla Quintana) has her doubts about Ralen\u2019s veracity when his wife arrives from Zatar to defend him. Brett Simmons directed the episode with teleplay by Thomas P. Vitale & Brett Simmons (#110.)\n\n[Spoiler TV]", "description": "Oscar Isaac says to expect some Poe Dameron backstory in The Rise of Skywalker.
