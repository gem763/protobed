But the Spaniard's 93rd minute save from Lasse Schone's spot kick wasn't the only remarkable moment in a drama-filled second half.\n\nAlso on rt.com Spurs goalkeeper Lloris 'set for 2-month layoff after dislocating elbow' in sickening injury\n\nGiampaolo's side had suffered four defeats from their opening six matches prior to Saturday's fixture to heap pressure on the former Sampdoria manager.\n\nThat pressure looked set to intensify when Schone drove in a free-kick a few minutes prior to half-time. It was a goal that would set into motion an absolutely incredible climax to the game.\n\nTimeline of events:\n\n41' - Lasse Schone gives Genoa the lead after terrible goalkeeping from Pepe Reina\n\n45' - Genoa's unused substitute Riccardo Saponara is sent off for comments directed at match officials from the bench\n\n51' - Theo Hernandez equalizes for AC Milan\n\n57' - Genoa's Davide Biraschi is sent off for serious foul play in the penalty area\n\n57' - Milan's Frank Kessie scores the resulting penalty\n\n79' - Milan's David Calabria is given his marching orders after receiving a second yellow card\n\n93' - Pepe Reina gives away a penalty, taking down Christian Kouame in the box\n\n93' - Reina saves the penalty, along with his blushes\n\n95' - Milan's unused substitute Samu Castillejo is sent off, also for comments directed at match officials from the bench\n\nThe three points will likely release some of the pressure Giampaolo has been facing since taking over at the San Siro prior to the start of this season, but the nature of the victory is unlikely to be too good for his blood pressure, or that of the club's fans.\n\nPepe Reina, meanwhile, was thrust into Milan's starting team after regular goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma fell ill on the morning of the game. And, despite being largely to blame for Genoa's opener, his dramatic intervention at the game's death will have more than made up for any previous errors the 37-year-old made.\n\nIt may also have gone a long way towards saving his head coach's job.", "description": "A frenzied encounter between struggling Serie A sides AC Milan and Genoa was eventually won by the Milanese but not before four players were sent off in an astonishing second half in which Pepe Reina saved a last-gasp penalty.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d99c34085f54040a2352358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
