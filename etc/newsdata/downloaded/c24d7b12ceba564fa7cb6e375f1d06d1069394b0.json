Bill Weld, a challenger to Donald Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, spoke in dire terms Monday of Trump\u2019s recent dealings with Ukraine:\n\n\u2018Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election. That\u2019s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It\u2019s treason pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That\u2019s the only penalty.\u2019\n\nWeld, fresh off a much-discussed joint op-ed with fellow Republican presidential candidates Mark Sanford and Joe Walsh, explained in a Monday interview on MSNBC that Trump should consider resigning amid the controversy. \u201cThat might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Weld\u2019s comments spread across the internet, one journalist cautioned that Trump\u2019s actions did not qualify for the treason label:\n\nYeah, @GovBillWeld needs to read Article III Section 3 of the constitution again. He\u2019s just as wrong about this as @realDonaldTrump is when he accuses the press or Democrats of treason. https://t.co/dXpgFkmeyK pic.twitter.com/xIAuOq9gyY \u2014 Andrew Feinberg (@AndrewFeinberg) September 23, 2019\n\nWatch the MSNBC interview:\n\nThe Trump administration responded, blaming the press rather than the intraparty challenger for broaching the treason topic. \u201cThe media\u2019s affliction with Trump Derangement Syndrome has driven them into an actual discussion of the proposed execution of the President of the United States,\u201d communications director Tim Murtaugh told Fox News. \u201cIn severe cases of TDS such as this, immediate consultation with a physician is recommended.\u201d", "description": "Former Massachusetts Governor and GOP presidential candidate Bill Weld didn\u2019t hold back on his assessment of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH651_weld04_ZG_20190415200635.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
