The struggle is that if they were deported, it would break up families,\" he said.\n\nTPS was granted to El Salvador following two devastating 2001 earthquakes that left hundreds of thousands of people homeless. The program offers protection from deportation to immigrants who already are in the United States, including those who entered illegally, from countries affected by natural disasters, civil conflicts and other problems.\n\nBukele also defended a deal with the United States, announced last Friday, which allows El Salvador to assess whether to extend refuge to migrants returned by the United States.\n\nHe pushed back on criticism that the policy turns El Salvador into an enforcer of the Trump administration's immigration policy, and also rejected suggestions it would lead to a massive influx of migrants.\n\n\"We have not put up any wall,\" Bukele said. \"What we have done is support our largest natural ally.\"\n\nUnder the agreement - which will take effect only after details are hammered out - the United States will in exchange help El Salvador expand its tiny asylum system.\n\nIt is similar to \"safe third country\" deals the Trump administration wants with several Latin American countries traversed by U.S.-bound migrants.\n\nImmigration advocates have criticized the deals, saying Central American countries - from which many people flee violence, poverty and corruption - lack the capacity to process more asylum claims and cannot assure migrants' safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Luc Cohen; editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "description": "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele on Thursday said the United States should promote legal migration as part of its crackdown on illegal immigration, calling on President Donald Trump to continue a program shielding some migrants from deportation.  \"If the U.S. government is serious about", "authors": ["Luc Cohen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nWY5oKpSWf7AvbzqVQGiMw--~B/aD0zMDQ7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/74d30b2378740b16ebf0b96e13808820", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
