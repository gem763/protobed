It's like this immaculate conception,' added the pinup.\n\nHoward told the icon that it was 'a revolutionary thing to actually do it' and it 'liberated everyone.'\n\nSome newsstands censored the cover.\n\nNude again: A year later she was nude again for Vanity Fair, this time without the bump and wearing body paint that made it seem as if she had on a suit and tie\n\n'I can't believe how crazy the response was, as if it was pornographic. How is that possible?' she wondered.\n\nThe shock jock then asked if she is angry that so many women have copied her cover. Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Cindy Crawford and Jessica Simpson have since posed nude when pregnant.\n\n'I love it,' Demi said. 'It's incredibly complimentary \u2026 I like that we have the freedom to express that.'\n\nStill very slender: Demi posed nude again for the November cover of Harper's Bazaar\n\nA year later she was nude again for Vanity Fair, this time without the bump and wearing body paint that made it seem as if she had on a suit and tie.\n\nStern also asked the ex of Bruce Willis about the time she danced in a bikini for David Letterman's late-night show.\n\n'I definitely was uncomfortable,' she said.\n\nThe star wrote about her body in her new book.

I never dared let up.'\n\nBut when she was filming A Few Good Men she had just welcomed her daughter Scout.\n\nShe wanted the baby weight off.

And there was a sex scene.\n\n'I would be on display again, and all I could think about was my body, my body, my body,' she said.\n\n'I doubled down on my already over-the-top exercise routine.

This time she had to look as desirable as can be as she worked a stripper pole.\n\n'When I was making Striptease, for breakfast I would measure out a half cup of oatmeal and prepare it with water, then for the rest of the day I would have only protein and some vegetables \u2014 and that was it,' she said.\n\n'If all this obsessing about my body sounds crazy to you, you're not wrong: eating disorders are crazy, they are a sickness. But that doesn't make them less real.'\n\nAnother sexy role: Next came the movie Indecent Proposal with Robert Redford and Woody Harrelson\n\nNo Big Macs for her: Robert's character pays $1M to sleep with the brunette, so she felt the pressure to look like a supermodel.

Jane in 1997. The star had to actually put on muscle to play a naval officer.\n\n'My usual reaction would have been to start starving myself again, to begin an exercise regime designed to reduce the bulk, but I did neither,' said Moore, who also shaved her head for the role.\n\n'I had reached my limit,' she said. 'When I got home to Idaho, I had an epiphany in the shower one day: I just need to be my natural size.'", "description": "The actress was seven months pregnant with her first daughter, Rumer Willis, at the time as she was photographed by\u00a0\u00a0Annie Leibovitz.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/22/19559370-0-image-a-99_1570741951044.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
