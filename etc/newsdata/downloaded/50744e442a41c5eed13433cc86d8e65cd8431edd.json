These stunning figures would seem to demand that mutual funds highlight the importance of dividend income.\"\n\nSo in other words, dividends are pretty important! Of course, right now the average stock on the S&P 500 is only paying about a 2% dividend yield, which isn't a lot. If you want to do better than that, though, the Stock Screener at TipRanks is a great way to begin your search for buy-rated stocks on Wall Street, paying above average dividend yields. A search conducted today, for example, turns up three likely suspects.\n\nSchlumberger (SLB)\n\nOne of the world's best-known \"oilfield services\" stocks, Schlumberger has fallen upon hard times of late. As oil prices first surged, then slumped back, after the Saudi oilfield missile attacks last month failed to spark a broader war in the Persian Gulf, Schlumberger stock has slumped right alongside them -- now down 45% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nLow oil prices mean less demand for oil, and less profits for oilfield servicers like Schlumberger. As a result, the $1.49 per share the company has earned over the past year leaves the stock trading for a not obviously cheap P/E ratio of 22 even with the decline in share price.\n\nAnd yet, the stock also pays a 6.5% dividend yield, and Wall Street analysts believe earnings could revive whether or not oil prices perform likewise. On average, analysts anticipate that Schlumberger stock could rebound 39%, rising from less than $33 today to as high as $45 over the next year. (See Schlumberger stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nOne of these analysts, Morgan Stanley's Connor Lynagh, predicted that a \"focus on returns\" and \"shutting down unprofitable assets... can drive earnings and cash flow improvement without higher oil prices or service price improvement.\" In particular, Lynagh thinks Schlumberger should focus on faster growing offshore markets rather than onshore drilling in North America, which is the company's \"weakest relative market.\" Overall, Lynagh believes the \"risk-reward for SLB is the most compelling it has been in years.\"\n\nMore optimistic than most, Lynagh has a $51 price target on Schlumberger -- good for a 55% profit if he's right. (To watch Lynagh's track record, click here)\n\nWilliams Companies (WMB)\n\nAnother great dividend payer operating in the oil patch is Williams Companies, which specializes in natural gas storage and transportation.\n\nDespite being only barely profitable under GAAP accounting standards, Williams pays a very nice dividend -- 6.6%. And before you wonder how a company only just \"breaking even\" can afford a dividend, let me point out that despite reporting only $63 million in GAAP profits, Williams generated well over $1.2 billion in positive free cash flow over the last year. It's only because of interest payments and a large, non-cash charge to earnings for asset write-downs that the stock appears unprofitable today.\n\nSpeaking of which, one of the analysts who recommends Williams Companies, J.P. Morgan's Jeremy Tonet, is in favor of the asset sales as they're raising cash needed to de-leverage the company and help \"blaze a path of capital discipline\" going forward. Looking forward, Tonet also argues that low natural gas prices are spurring demand for natural gas, creating \"associated infrastructure expansion needs representing the primary driver for WMB's long term growth outlook.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "How important are dividends to a stock investor's profits?Speaking before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on October 15, 2007, investing guru John Bogle laid out the case:\"Over the past 81 years ... reinvested dividend income accounted for approximately 95 percent of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/13hl4PbxtKzFd99XfGLmXg--~B/aD01MTM7dz0xMTk5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/4d814097b05d461da0bd2959a3f6c2fe", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
