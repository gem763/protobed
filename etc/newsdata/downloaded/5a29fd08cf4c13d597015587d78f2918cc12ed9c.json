long ditches that formed water ways, permeable paving, and storm water drainage at green belts and parks that would be in the development.\n\nAdvocate Murray Bridgeman for the PHAFC said the applicants do favour development, but just not on the aquifer, which they regard as unique agricultural land.\n\nHe added there had been \"little or no\" public participation before deciding to \"soften the urban edge\" and the applicants did not have the money to challenge the issues when they first arose in 2011.\n\nAs part of his argument, Bridgeman proposed a \"land swap\" as a \"commercial solution\" so that Oakdale's investors get land elsewhere within the city, and their Cosatu pension fund investors do not suffer.\n\nAdvocate Peter Kantor, dealing with the environmental aspect of the case on behalf of the applicants, submitted that the decision in 2011 to soften the urban edge for Oakland was illegal because the relevant environmental assessment processes were not followed.\n\nJudgment was reserved.", "description": "Cape Town's urban farmers in the Philippi Horticultural Area have challenged the government's procedures in allowing a privately owned parcel of it to be developed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9485/95cd9aef00e64a54aaf1ab3297bd453e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
