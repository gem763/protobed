(AP) - Bryce Perkins ran for three touchdowns and Wayne Taulapapa ran for two as Virginia beat Duke for the fifth year in a row, 48-14, on Saturday.\n\nThe Cavaliers (5-2, 3-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) forced five turnovers in the key Coastal Division matchup and turned them into 20 points. Joe Reed also returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, his second kickoff return touchdown this season and fifth of his career.\n\nThe Blue Devils (4-3, 2-2) came in averaging more than 40 points over their last five games but managed only a 36-yard scoring pass from Quentin Harris to Scott Bracey against Virginia\u2019s front-line defense. Duke gained just 166 yards in the first three quarters before Chris Katrenick replaced Harris for the final 15 minutes. Katrenick hit Eli Pancol with a 23-yard touchdown pass with 2:41 remaining.\n\nPerkins scored on two 1-yard runs and a 3-yard run and Taulapapa scored on runs of 3 and 9 yards. The Cavaliers had four scoring drives of 34 yards or fewer - one after they stopped Duke on a fourth-and-1 play - and led 27-0 before the Blue Devils finally scored.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nDuke: The Blue Devils\u2019 fourth first down came midway through the third quarter when the snap to punter Austin Parker on fourth-and-3 from the Duke 32 bounced and Parker picked it up and ran 4 yards. Four plays later, on fourth-and-5, Parker was on again to punt and appeared to be trying a rugby-style kick but instead tucked the ball and ran for 12 yards to the Virginia 46. It was the first time the Blue Devils crossed midfield all game.\n\nVirginia: The Cavaliers caught a break in the first half when Perkins dove over the pile for the end zone and fumbled. Duke players charged out of the pile in celebration, but a review determined that Perkins had broken the plane of the end zone before the ball came loose, giving the Cavaliers a 17-0 lead.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Blue Devils are on the road again, facing North Carolina on Saturday.\n\nVirginia starts a two-game road trip at Louisville on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bryce Perkins ran for three touchdowns and Wayne Taulapapa ran for two as Virginia beat Duke for the fifth year in a row, 48-14, on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hank Kurz Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/duke_virginia_football_20572_c0-156-3749-2342_s1200x700.jpg?91aa545e3a938b187b99fc917cb4dfb963d7eaf5", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
