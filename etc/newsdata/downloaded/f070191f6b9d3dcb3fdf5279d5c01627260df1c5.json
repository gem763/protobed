Given a second straight application of the tag, that would have guaranteed him a $19.2 million salary, but Clowney was more interested in a long-term deal.\n\nClowney\u2019s salary proved to be a problem\n\nAlthough Clowney is one of the most talented edge rushers in the league \u2014 a vital position every team \u2014 his prohibitive salary and short-term contract made it a surprisingly tough sell.\n\nAs Yahoo Sports\u2019 Charles Robinson reported, the Miami Dolphins \u2014 who were involved with the Texans in another trade Saturday \u2014 were the only team believed to be willing to eat all of Clowney\u2019s contract.\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nAdd in the fact that Clowney had asked out and specifically wanted to join the Seahawks or Philadelphia Eagles, and the Texans\u2019 task of dealing their former franchise cornerstone was not enviable. Since he still hadn\u2019t signed the franchise tender and didn\u2019t want to sign a long-term deal, there wasn\u2019t much they could have done.\n\nThrowing in money to get rid of one of your best players doesn\u2019t sound good, but the alternative of letting him hold out the whole season is much worse.\n\nThe Texans paid $7 million to trade edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney to the Seahawks.

Instead, the team replaced him with a pair of former top-5 overall picks in Clowney and Ezekiel Ansah ($7.9 million cap hit).\n\nClowney and Ansah lack the consistency the Seahaws may have gotten from Clark, but it\u2019s hard to argue about their additional value before considering the $300,000 they saved on their cap sheet.\n\nSeattle didn\u2019t give up a ton to land Clowney \u2014 a third-rounder and edge defenders Barkevious Mingo and Jacob Martin \u2014 but it may still feel like a loss if they can\u2019t lock up Clowney beyond 2019. Regardless, they\u2019re clearly coming out in the black for this season after letting their star edge rusher go.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Texans will pay Jadeveon Clowney's $7 million signing bonus with the Seahawks covering the remaining $8.9 million.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OSL6L0tx3z9Y_1DjNi9jPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NTUuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SpPUZInKawRuOf2_9IUBHA--~B/aD0xNzM1O3c9MjMyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/9e79fe50-ccdb-11e9-8c6f-9ab55d1cdda3"}
