Now, according to two people familiar with events, Mr. Gowdy is never expected to join the team. And Trump advisers are back to square one, searching for a different lawyer.\n\nHow a celebrated announcement quickly ended in disarray offers a rare public glimpse into the internal posturing \u2014 and undercutting of colleagues \u2014 that has been playing out in the West Wing on a daily basis since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry last month. Even as the White House confronts a deepening threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, it has struggled to decide how to respond, and who should lead that response.", "description": "", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trey-Gowdy-Trump-Impeachment.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
