In June, Anthony Albanese announced his intention to have Mr Sekta expelled from the party for bringing the \"party into disrepute\". The Victorian CFMMEU boss filed a challenge with the courts to stop the expulsion, but the case was thrown out of court. On Wednesday, Mr Albanese announced Mr Setka had withdrawn his appeal and resigned as a member of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. \"It is a very satisfactory result in the interests of the Labor Party, and might I say, for the interest of trade union people everywhere,\" Mr Albanese said.
