Coal is also widely used for power generation in the country.\n\nAir Visual - an independent online air quality index monitor - says Hanoi\u2019s reading of PM2.5 has exceeded 300 micrograms per cubic metre at times, the worst in the world. On Tuesday, it showed PM2.5 levels at 180 in Hanoi and 86 in Ho Chi Minh.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends an air quality standard for PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms per cubic metre.\n\nSuch pollution could become a political issue in Vietnam, where protests have been held in the past against the degradation of the environment. Communist-ruled Vietnam tolerates little dissent and protesters and activists are often prevented from gathering or charged with \u201ccausing public disorder\u201d.\n\n\u201cLocal people, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with respiratory issues should refrain from traffic and outdoor activities,\u201d the government said in the statement.\n\nPM2.5 levels are forecast to stay high over the next days, particularly at night and early in the morning, it added.\n\n\u201cPeople should wear masks and goggles when going outdoor,\u201d the government said in the statement.\n\nSimilar slash-and-burn farming practices have also led to forest fires in Indonesia that have created a choking haze across Malaysia and Singapore in recent weeks.", "description": "Vietnam warned its people on Tuesday to limit outdoor activities because the air quality in the Southeast Asian country has persistently been at \"unhealthy\" levels for days.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435819016&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902BA", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
