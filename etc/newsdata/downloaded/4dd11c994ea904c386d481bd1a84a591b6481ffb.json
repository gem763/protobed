REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.18%. Australian shares were up 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei stock index .N225 opened higher but reversed course and fell 0.3%.\n\nU.S. stock futures, ESc1 fell 0.44% in Asia on Monday after the S&P 500 .SPX surged 1.4% on Friday.\n\nThe offshore yuan CNH fell 0.3% to 7.1352 to the dollar after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are signaling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThere was no onshore yuan trading, as Monday is the last day of a long China holiday for its national day.\n\nThe media report also pushed up safe-haven assets such as gold and the yen.\n\nCrude oil futures extended declines in a sign that investors remain cautious about a resolution to the trade dispute.\n\nSentiment toward the U.S. economy deteriorated sharply much of last week after disappointing data on manufacturing and services suggested the trade war was taking a toll, and more rate cuts would be needed to avert a potential recession in the world\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nBut a modest September increase in U.S. jobs, announced on Friday, eased some of these concerns and lifted U.S. markets that day. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September to reach the lowest since December 1969. Non-farm payrolls also grew in September, but slightly less than expected.\n\n\u201cModerate job growth and subdued inflation in the United States is a positive for stocks,\u201d said Shusuke Yamada, head of FX and Japan equity strategy at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities in Tokyo.\n\nThis week, the main focus will be the high-level U.S.-China trade negotiations expected in Washington on Oct. 10-11 to see if the two sides can end a bruising year-long trade war that has hurt global growth and raised the risk of recession.\n\n\u201cThe dollar is a little soft heading into U.S.-China trade talks,\u201d said Yamada. \u201cI see some scope for yen gains, but it is not likely to be a big move higher.\u201d\n\nThe United States and China have slapped tariffs on each other\u2019s goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing\u2019s trading practices, which Washington says are unfair.\n\nCentral banks around the world have been easing policy to try to offset the impact of the trade war.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates twice this year. Before the jobs report, traders saw a 85.2% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% this month, but that chance has now fallen to 81.1%, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose to 1.5238% on Monday compared with its U.S. close of 1.5140% on Friday.\n\nSpot gold XAU=, an asset often bought during times of uncertainty, rose 0.15% to $1,506.93 per ounce.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS, also considered a safe-haven asset, edged slightly higher to 106.83 versus the U.S. dollar and gained to 72.17 per Australian dollar AUDJPY=.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 dipped 0.21% to $52.7 a barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 0.39% to $58.13 per barrel. In addition to worries about the global economy, signs of oversupply in the oil market are weighing on futures prices.\n\nPolitical instability in Hong Kong could hurt market sentiment after China\u2019s army took the unusual step of issuing warnings to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong over the weekend.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s stock market is closed on Monday for a public holiday. Trading will resume on Tuesday.\n\nFour months of often violent protests against Chinese rule has pushed the former British colony to the brink of recession and posed a serious challenge to Beijing\u2019s control of the city.", "description": "Asian shares edged higher on Monday after data showed the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in almost 50 years, easing concerns of a slowdown in the world's largest economy.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437886135&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9600Y", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
