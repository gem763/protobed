Le Guin, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, George R.R. Martin, and more. Now, it\u2019s taking on a new medium: comic books. This September, it\u2019ll release Marvel: The Golden Age, 1939-1949, a compilation of the company\u2019s classic comics.\n\nThe book is designed to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Marvel Comics #1. It\u2019s now available for preorder, and it will retail for $225 when it\u2019s released on September 25th. It\u2019ll also come with a 64-page replica of that original comic.\n\nThe Folio Society\u2019s books are aimed toward collectors and serious readers: its offerings aren\u2019t paperbacks or hardcovers that you\u2019ll find on the shelves of your local bookstore. They\u2019re volumes that often come with special slipcovers and contain introductions from the authors or their contemporaries, as well as original artwork, all on high-quality paper. I\u2019ve long been impressed with its offerings (and have bought a bunch over the years) because of the effort that\u2019s put in and the art that the publisher includes with each one.\n\nFolio Society editorial director Tom Walker tells The Verge that moving into comics is a \u201creally thrilling new enterprise for us,\u201d but he notes that \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel like virgin territory. Marvel Comics have been one of the great literary influences of the past century, and as I started to explore that world, I found the comic form had inspired so many of my own favorite writers, from Neil Gaiman to Margaret Atwood.\u201d\n\nWalker explains that the Folio Society wanted to anthologize the major Marvel eras, and its \u201caim was to allow readers to get closer to the Golden Age of Marvel Comics than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d To assemble the book, the society partnered with Roy Thomas, the writer and editor who succeeded Stan Lee at Marvel Comics. He helped with the selection process for the book, which includes characters like Captain America, The Human Torch, and Namor, The Sub-Mariner.\n\nWalker says that he\u2019s most proud of the reproduction of Marvel Comics #1, which was based on an original copy from 1939 that it was able to track down. \u201cWe spent hours perfecting this, choosing the right grade of paper and finding ways to recreate the experience kids would have had picking this up from the newsstand for the first time.\u201d The other comics included in the main volume are reproduced from \u201cfirst-edition comics both from the Marvel archives and from major private collectors, in order to find the most pristine copies to offset,\u201d Walker says.\n\nThe Folio Society says that the volume is the first in an ongoing partnership with Marvel Comics, and the next volume is set to come out sometime in the first half of 2020.", "description": "The Folio Society will release an omnibus of comics for the first time, celebrating the 80th anniversary of Marvel Comics #1.
