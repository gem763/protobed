Surely losing the minds behind one of the biggest TV shows is a huge blow?\n\nWell, yes, it probably would have been if we were still living in 2018 and Game of Thrones\u2019 final season had been anything but the crushing disappointment it turned out to be.\n\nGame of Thrones\u2019 final season was a devastating failure \u2013 mainly thanks to Weiss and Benioff\u2019s writing (Picture: HBO)\n\nIf there was one thing that became clear at the end of HBO\u2019s high-fantasy epic, it was that everything about the show \u2013 from its actors, to the special effects and direction \u2013 was firing on all cylinders. Everything, in fact, except for arguably the most important thing \u2013 the writing and construction of the show itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won\u2019t turn this into a massive Game of Thrones rant, but it is important to note that the show\u2019s eighth season demonstrated a complete failure in terms of coherent plotting and character development \u2013 problems that the show had tried to shake off ever since it had overtaken its source material.\n\nThat didn\u2019t seem to bode well for Star Wars either. Much like the latter seasons of Game of Thrones, this new trilogy would not have the crutch of previous movies to lean on; it\u2019s supposed to be an entirely new story, an entirely new cinematic universe to explore.\n\nThe new trilogy would be a totally new story, separate from the Skywalker saga (Picture: Disney)\n\nThe one thing Weiss and Benioff proved with Thrones is that, when left to their own devices, their writing can leave a lot to be desired \u2013 and their creations as a whole suffer because of it.\n\nTheir exit from the new trilogy, then, may prove to be a smart move for Star Wars. The franchise hasn\u2019t been struggling per se, but it\u2019s certainly had a tough few years.\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story was the first veritable box office bomb in the franchise\u2019s history and the franchise is still licking its wounds from the fan backlash against director Rian Johnson\u2019s The Last Jedi, something that Disney seemed determined to remedy by placing the last film in the sequel trilogy in the safe hands of JJ Abrams.\n\nThe two showrunners havr signed a massive $250million deal with Netflix (Picture: Jeff Kravitz)\n\nThe two showrunners may have also seemed like a similar pair of safe hands, before everything fell apart this year. All of a sudden, they weren\u2019t the most popular writers in the world, they were the two men who almost brought down the legacy of one of TV\u2019s most popular shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not to say, however, that Thrones killed Weiss and Benioff\u2019s careers, because it hasn\u2019t. The two recently signed a massive $250million deal to produce original content with Netflix, their commitments to which have been blamed for their Star Wars exit.\n\nBut what it does mean is that their names, and work, now carry a legacy that some may find hard to move past. Would you want to watch the newest TV series or movie by the two guys who ruined Game of Thrones?\n\nEven with the lackluster final season, there is no denying characters like Cersei Lannister were the product of great writing (Picture: HBO)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say, however, that Benioff and Weiss can\u2019t be great again. The first six seasons of Game of Thrones are pretty much perfect television, and their writing \u2013 whether hugely supported by the source novels or not \u2013 is a massive part of that.\n\nDaenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister and Margaery Tyrell are some of the most vivid, complex and brilliant characters of the past decade for a reason, and again their writing is a massive part of that.\n\nMaybe their Star Wars trilogy would have actually been brilliant, maybe it would have proved all of us wrong and had us eating our words after the comprehensive Thrones backlash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019ll never know the answer for sure. But, for now at least, this means that the future for Star Wars beyond Rise of Skywalker is unsure.\n\nFor this writer, though, I would love to see Rian Johnson\u2019s much-touted trilogy pushed front of the queue, given that his writing and direction on The Last Jedi was such a breath of fresh air that actually dared to subvert and challenge the source material \u2013 something which the final season of Thrones seriously lacked.\n\nI will probably tune into whatever original content Benioff and Weiss create for Netflix, just like I\u2019ll tune in for the Game of Thrones prequel too. You never know, they might surprise me still. I like to believe the best in people. I like to believe that they can learn from their mistakes.\n\nGame of Thrones seasons 1-8 are available to stream now via NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
