I said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it anyway,\u2019 and they said, \u2018Sir, we\u2019d rather not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters in Havelock, North Carolina, near the coast.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, told Mr. Trump that three residents died from Dorian-related weather but that damage wasn\u2019t as bad as the last two storms to hit his state. He also hailed the work of the U.S. Coast Guard in recovery efforts.\n\nMr. Trump echoed that praise and hailed state leaders.\n\n\u201cThe governors have really done a fantastic job, whether Democrat or Republican,\u201d the president said.\n\nTwo leaders Republicans on the plane, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said they will get relief money flowing to North Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to fund the government entirely by the end of the month, but I promise you we\u2019ll do everything we can to get the funds going,\u201d Mr. Graham told Mr. Cooper. \u201cBeing your neighbor I\u2019m really sorry. I know it\u2019s been really hard on you.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
