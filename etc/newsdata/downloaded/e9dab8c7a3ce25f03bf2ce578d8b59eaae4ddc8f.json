US gender docs \u201ctrain\u201d judges & call CPS on balking parents", "language": "en", "text": "The meteoric rise in kids diagnosed as transgender in the last five years has caught many parents by surprise. Gender specialists, trans activists, and their media handmaidens explain this accelerating trend as simply the welcome result of society becoming more accepting of trans people; a continuation of the tolerance that ushered in same-sex marriage. Indeed, activist-clinicians are quick to claim equivalence between trans and being gay or lesbian, despite their fundamental differences.\n\nFor one thing, lesbians and gay men ask only to be accepted for who they love, while we are asked to believe that being \u201cauthentic\u201d as trans may require us to approve drastic medical interventions\u2013for our own kids. And no mental gymnastics are necessary for parents to see with their own eyes when a daughter or son is homosexual. But a sudden pronouncement by one\u2019s kid that they are really the opposite sex requires a suspension of disbelief; a demand to ignore one\u2019s own insight, perception, and knowledge in order to \u201cvalidate\u201d the \u201cidentity\u201d of our kids.\n\nDespite the insistence that hormones and surgeries are \u201clife-saving\u201d medical necessities, the push is on to \u201cdepathologize\u201d trans identity as a \u201cnormal human variation.\u201d Yet nearly to a one, the parents who have gathered on- and offline as part of the 4thWaveNow community report a history of mental illness, social difficulties, frequently multiple diagnoses that predate the sudden announcement \u201cI\u2019m trans!\u201d Indeed, a cursory hunt through decades of medical and psychological literature reveals that gender dysphoria occurs with troubling frequency in concert with a range of other mental disturbances, including personality disorders, depression, anxiety, and autism. To take but one example, this 2003 survey of nearly 200 Dutch psychiatrists found that a large majority of people with gender dysphoria had comorbid psychiatric problems.\n\nWhat has actually changed since 2003, apart from trans activism overruling sensible debate and clinical experience?\n\nGiven the experience of so many parents, corroborated by research evidence and clinical experience around the world, is it any wonder parents might balk at the idea that their (often troubled) tween or teen needs immediate \u201caffirmation\u201d and \u201cvalidation\u201d of their trans ID\u2014complete with puberty blockers and/or cross-sex hormones?\n\nBut in 2017, at least in the US, pediatric gender specialists see co-occurring mental illness as no barrier to prescribing puberty blockers or cross sex hormones\u2013even in the case of obviously troubled young people who have undergone multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. To these gender clinicians, puberty blockers are absolutely vital\u2014even when the psychiatric team isn\u2019t on board. (And even, apparently, when new information has come to light about the serious adverse effects of Lupron on children and adults.)\n\nThe inaugural conference of USPATH, the newly formed offshoot of WPATH, was held the first weekend of February in Los Angeles. At a session entitled \u201cPUBERTY SUPPRESSION IN THE UNITED STATES; PRACTICE MODELS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS,\u201d gender doctor Michelle Forcier presented a case study of a young teen \u201cK.\u201d who had been seen in Forcier\u2019s gender clinic. K., born female, had been hospitalized multiple times for suicidality, cutting, an eating disorder, and other self harm. K\u2019s mother was reluctant to use a male name and pronouns, and was not initially willing to consent to Lupron.\n\nDuring one of K\u2019s months-long hospitalizations, Forcier pushed for the child to start blockers, despite the fact that the psychiatric team caring for K. was not in agreement, but was intent on medically stabilizing the child before contemplating other interventions.\n\nAfter the child was released from hospital, the mother eventually consented to puberty blockers; the child was hospitalized again a few weeks after the Lupron injection. In her presentation, Forcier said that the time spent without blockers was one of many \u201cmissed opportunities;\u201d she used the case as an example of how psychiatrists need to be better \u201ceducated.\u201d\n\nThis notion that \u201cgender care\u201d (Forcier\u2019s term) is the curative elixir, the pharmacological key to solving a whole host of other psychiatric issues, is a common refrain with US gender specialists. Parental reluctance to go along with this recommendation is viewed with, at best, condescension, and at worst, bald contempt. Do these providers stop for an instant to think maybe, just maybe, these parents have some wisdom regarding their own kids, whom they have raised and loved from birth? Nope.\n\nEven young people who identify as \u201cnonbinary\u201d are encouraged if they choose hormones\u2014or even surgeries. The USPATH conference devoted plenty of time to medical interventions for youth who want to dabble in irreversible chemical or surgical interventions:\n\nBalking parents must be \u201ceducated\u201d, cajoled into going against their deepest protective instincts. If this indoctrination process doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s the frequent threat your kid will kill themselves because of your hesitations. This weaponization of adult self-harm statistics is wielded by activists, clinicians, and the media alike, to terrorize parents into handing their offspring off to be drugged, sterilized, and (increasingly) surgically \u201ccorrected\u201d by therapists and doctors who are confident they know best when it comes to other people\u2019s children.\n\nNever mind that there is scant evidence that medical transition cures self harm in the long run; never mind that the constantly quoted 41% trans suicide attempt rate didn\u2019t control for mental illness (a flaw readily admitted by the survey authors). Never mind that the 41% survey was of adults over 18, not kids. Never mind that there is no prior historical evidence of \u201ctrans kids\u201d so desperate to escape their \u201cwrong\u201d bodies that they become suicidal; never mind that the highly publicized clusters of transgender teen suicides have mostly been young people who were supported in their desire to transition. Never mind that no one is studying the mental health of formerly trans-identified youth who were fully supported in gender nonconformity but not endorsed as being in the \u201cwrong body.\u201d And never mind that only mentally ill people see suicide as a solution to life\u2019s frustrations. (As an analogy, the suicide rate for white Americans is much higher than for other ethnic groups, who by any measure face more discrimination and difficulties, yet manage to maintain more psychological resilience.)\n\nBut none of this stops irresponsible journalists and activists from spreading suicide contagion to vulnerable gender-confused youth.\n\nWhen it comes to coercing parents, the suicide trump card usually works. The daily onslaught of celebratory \u201ctrans kid\u201d stories often includes a statement by a parent that they\u2019d \u201crather have a live son than a dead daughter\u201d (or vice versa). Not surprisingly, scaring parents with their worst possible nightmare has been quite effective in many cases (including that of Ryland, one of the better known celebrity trans kids).\n\nHillary Googled the word \u201ctransgender\u201d and came across a horrifying statistic: 41% of transgender Americans attempt suicide. \u201cThis made things very clear to me,\u201d says Hillary. \u201cDid I want a living son or a dead daughter? I wasn\u2019t going to take the risk by waiting around and doing nothing.\u201d So Hillary and Jeff spoke to psychologists, psychiatrists and gender therapists, who all reached the same conclusion: Ryland is transgender. As Hillary describes it, \u201cAlthough Ryland was born with the anatomy of a girl, her brain identifies with that of a boy.\u201d That day, Hillary and Jeff \u2013 both churchgoing Christians who were raised in conservative families \u2013 made a vow: to bring up Ryland as a boy, without any strings attached.\n\nNot only do the people most invested in medically transitioning children push suicide or transition as the only two alternatives; they are not shy about blaming the parents themselves for the child\u2019s self harming behaviors.\n\nTowards the end of a USPATH session, ADDRESSING SUICIDALITY IN TRANSGENDER YOUTH: A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL APPROACH, presenters Elizabeth Burke, Matthew Oransky, and Sarah McGrew touched on what to do about parents who weren\u2019t on board with \u201cgender care.\u201d\u00ad\u00ad\n\nAnd the final piece on suicidality is family non-acceptance. This is where you have a family who is saying, no, no, no\u2026and then you realize that actually the family is contributing to some of that negativity at home. So the family is creating a toxic environment. And that\u2019s where we have let the young person know the potential ramifications of calling DHS and saying that this is an unsafe environment. And that we\u2019ve given the family every chance. To learn, to grow. And they\u2019re continuing to be part of the problem. So thankfully this was an important time when I realized it was worthwhile in starting the clinic at children\u2019s hospital to have lots of meetings with the lawyers in risk management. To be able to say, \u201calright. I have the ethicist, I have the lawyer, I have the guru from risk management, I\u2019m gonna sit down and say, I need to describe a case to you and make sure this is actually parents being negligent in the healthcare needs of their child. Thankfully we\u2019ve had a lot of support in that realm. Because of the trainings we\u2019ve done with DHS workers in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. DHS workers will go and say you\u2019re creating an unsafe environment for your child. And we need to have that stop.\u2026unfortunately staying in that home environment is going to result in a child\u2019s suicide.\n\nSo we see that gender specialists and activists are being proactive about going after parents who are saying \u201cno no no\u201d to the dictate that they must \u201caffirm\u201d their child as the opposite sex. They are \u201ctraining\u201d child protective services workers to pressure parents into \u201cgender care\u201d\u2014or risk losing custody of their sons and daughters.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a brand-new strategy. For example, at least as far back as June 2015, Jenn Burleton, an MTF and director of TransActive Gender Center, put out a call for attorneys to intervene in custody disputes involving \u201ctrans kids\u201d, to enthusiastic responses on Burleton\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nAsaf Orr, for those who don\u2019t know, is the lead staff attorney for the inaccurately named \u201cNational Center for Lesbian Rights\u201d (NCLR). Given the fact that an increasingly large number of same-sex attracted adolescent girls are being transitioned, it\u2019s hard to imagine any organization straying further from its mission than NCLR.\n\nRegular readers of 4thWaveNow know that Burleton has been in the business of sneaking behind the backs of \u201cunsupportive\u201d parents with TransActive\u2019s \u201cIn a Bind\u201d free binder distribution program. Previously offered to young women 22 and under, the program now only sends binders to 18 and unders\u2014secretly, if need be, subverting the will of parents who might have concerns about the unhealthy effects on their daughters: crushing pubescent breast tissue, bruising ribs, breathing and musculoskeletal problems, and more.\n\nThe topic of bending reluctant parents to the will of gender experts is a popular one for WPATH. In mid-February, we find some familiar people scheming away about what to do about parents who won\u2019t give in, again including Jenn Burleton, who has had \u201csome success\u201d in convincing authorities that a parent\u2019s unwillingness to approve hormones for their minor children is a form of \u201creportable trauma.\u201d\n\nAt the February USPATH conference, Drs. Johanna Olson-Kennedy and Michelle Forcier, during the Q&A portion of their aforementioned talk on puberty suppression, tell their audience that they\u2019re not afraid to involve the courts when they must to \u201cbring along\u201d the \u201crecalcitrant\u201d parents. One questioner, a psychologist who runs a gender clinic, wants to know whether there is a way to legally \u201cforce parents\u201d to go along with the recommendations of a gender therapist to administer puberty blockers.\n\nOLSON-KENNEDY: I can say that the stickiest situations I\u2019ve had is where one parent is supportive and one isn\u2019t and they share medical custody. And so we work really hard to bring both parents in and bring them both on board. Because even if you get a court order, the most protective factor for a good outcome is parental support. So it\u2019s not my first line to go to court to get somebody what they need. But it is my second line and I will do it. We\u2019ve been pretty successful in 5 or 6 situations where\u2026we really had a recalcitrant parent that we just could not bring along.\n\nFor her part, Forcier says her team has been busy training family court judges in her region:\n\nFORCIER: Yeah, there\u2019s no precedent but you can again work with the child protection team for medical neglect. Work with one parent\u2026at least to get things started. And again, you can do some education. We did education with judges in Rhode Island. We spent a half day with family court judges, telling them this is what gender and transgender is\u2026\n\nSo there we have it. Activists/clinicians aren\u2019t content to simply \u201ceducate,\u201d cajole, or negotiate with parents. If parents aren\u2019t terrorized into medically transitioning their kids by the relentless scolding that the only alternative is suicide, these people are perfectly willing to call the authorities on you; even to try to take your children away from you. And woe betide you if you\u2019re a divorced or divorcing parent trying to put the brakes on hormones or surgeries for your minor child. The likes of Asaf Orr and other assorted attorneys assembled by adult trans activists will intervene in your custody dispute. (How ironic is it that an organization purporting to protect lesbian rights can be instrumental in forcing parents of lesbian teens to \u201ctransition\u201d them to the opposite sex?).\n\nLest we simply dismiss all this as a form of mind-numbing hubris from people who should mind their own business, this excerpt from a letter written by four activist MtoFs in 2004 as part of a campaign to discredit sexologist Michael Bailey, might shed some light on the motivations of key activists who have been at the forefront of the pediatric transition explosion.\n\nWe are socially assimilated trans women who are mentors to many young transsexuals in transition. Unable to bear children of our own, the girls we mentor become like children to us. These young women depend on us for guidance during the difficult period of transition and then on during their adventures afterwards \u2013 dating, careers, marriages and sometimes adoption of their own children. As a result, we have large extended families and are blessed by these relationships. \u2026 You may have wondered why hundreds of successful, assimilated trans women like us, women from all across the country, are being so persistent in investigating Mr. Bailey and in uncovering and reporting his misdeeds. Now you have your answer: We are hundreds of loving moms whose children he is tormenting!\n\nSo some trans activists fancy themselves the \u201cloving moms\u201d of (our) trans-identified kids, young people they consider their \u201cextended family.\u201d Not content to fight for their own rights to non-discrimination in housing and employment, activists like these were and still are the driving force behind the proliferation of pediatric gender clinics and activist organizations that have sprung up like mushrooms across the Western world in the last decade.\n\nAs should be clear from the examples in this post (representing only the tip of the iceberg), certain trans activists and gender clinicians will stop at nothing to force their will on parents who resist the affirm-only, puberty-blocking, sterilizing doctrine of pediatric medical transition. Rather than demonstrating a willingness to learn; rather than having the humility to consider that parents just might have a better handle on who their children are and what they need than a group of professionals beholden to an activist juggernaut, gender doctors and trans activists like Jenn Burleton may well try to take your children away from you.\n\nWhat can be done? If you believe a gender specialist, psychologist, or doctor has rushed to \u201caffirm\u201d your troubled child as \u201ctrans\u201d; if you believe someone entrusted with your child\u2019s care has not adequately explored your child\u2019s mental health and other underlying issues which may be contributing to their gender confusion, report them to their professional organizations and regulating boards.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/4thwavenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/judge-order-hormones-remove-child-from-house.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&ssl=1", "published_at": "2017-02-25"}
