Growth has slowed but [the economy] is not close to recession,\" he concluded.\n\nAnd we have to say -- this all seems terribly confusing. So are we facing a recession risk or aren't we? According to the investment banker's latest thinking, instead of crashing, the economy is doing just fine, and stock markets that slumped on Monday could quickly rebound, sending the S&P 500 up as much as 5% by the end of this year. But what if Goldman is wrong now, and what if it was right last week?\n\nJust to be safe, we've asked the Stock Screener at TipRanks to suggest for us a few stocks receiving \"buy\" or stronger ratings on Wall Street, and receiving \"buy\" ratings from Goldman Sachs in particular. Whether the economy does well or poorly in general, either way, Goldman Sachs at least thinks these three stocks will do well. Let's take a closer look:\n\nLamb Weston Holdings (LW)\n\nLamb Weston Holdings isn't the sexiest stock pick on the planet, but if you're looking for a recession-resistant stock, you might well want to put this one in your pantry. Lamb Weston, you see, produces and sells frozen potatoes, sweet potatoes, and appetizers to restaurants, grocers, and wholesalers. And no matter how bad any recession gets, we doubt it's going to get so bad that people can't afford potatoes.\n\nPotato supplies look \"average\" in 2020, input costs are \"benign,\" and pricing is \"consistent with ... expectations.\" But in a note released last week, Goldman analyst Adam Samuelson cited strength in the quick-serve restaurant channel driving \"organic volume growth of 6%\" as one key reason to like the stock. (To watch Samuelson's track record, click here)\n\nIn fact, with earnings estimates on the rise -- up about a penny for 2020 to $3.56 per share, and up $0.12 and $0.11 respectively in 2021 and 2022 -- Samuelson is confident enough in this one to rate Lamb Weston a \"buy\" with a $85 price target, 5% above the consensus price on Wall Street, and good enough for a 12% gain from today's prices. Throw in a modest 1.1% dividend yield, and Lamb Weston should comfortably outperform the market going forward.\n\nLamb Weston price target More\n\nAll in all, TipRanks reveals the potato giant as one drawing bullish attention on Wall Street. Out of 4 analysts polled in the last 3 months, all 4 are bullish on LW stock. The 12-month average price target stands at $81.25, marking a 7% upside potential from where the stock is currently trading. (See LW stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nMoelis (MC)\n\nAnother low-profile stock pick that nonetheless caught Goldman's eye this week is investment bank Moelis. You may not have heard of this one -- with a market capitalization of only $1.5 billion, Moelis flies far below the heady heights of better-known investment banking names like JPMorgan... or Goldman Sachs. But by the same token, the fact that Goldman Sachs itself thinks this one is worth a look may carry some weight.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Less than a week ago, Goldman Sachs private wealth management chief investment officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani stoked investor worries with a comment putting the chances of a recession hitting the U.S. in 2020 at somewhere between 25% and 30%.But less than a week later, Goldman global strategist Peter", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/g6bL7UuDNRDfXFxbRb1bOg--~B/aD02NDg7dz0xNTA2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/eab3e221176787a72a047be4e9cb4961", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
