The agency said it found no evidence Ms. Yang performed any activities as CFO until her purported resignation in July 2016. The company\u2019s auditors had never communicated with her, the SEC said.\n\nThe SEC said it is seeking civil fines and a bar from Mr. Simeo serving as a public-company officer or director.\n\nA representative for Viking, now led by CEO James Doris, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A message seeking a comment from Mr. Simeo wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\nMr. Simeo served as CEO and chairman of the board from 2008 and 2014. He was executive chairman from 2014 to 2016, when he took the interim CFO role for nearly one year. He resigned from the company in 2017, the SEC said.\n\nThe company\u2019s current CFO, Frank Barker Jr., has served in the finance chief role since December 2017, a regulatory filing showed.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "Tom Simeo, the former CEO of Viking Energy Group Inc., was charged with violating antifraud provisions of securities laws, the regulator said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108080/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
