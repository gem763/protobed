(Image: Leinil Francis Yu, Gerry Alanguilan, Sunny Gho, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nMutantkind has entered a bold new age. Mutants are here, they are proud, they are independent \u2014 and they are also down to bonk.\n\nIn the wake of the shocking conclusion to the duology that is Marvel\u2019s House and Powers of X, this week saw the release of X-Men #1, kicking off an entire new roster of X-books that carries on the audacious ideas mutant mastermind Jonathan Hickman began to establish in his landmark event series.\n\nPenned by Hickman, with art by Leinil Francis Yu, Gerry Alanguilan, and Sunny Gho, and lettering by Clayton Cowles, X-Men #1 offers a heady mix of the superheroic and the mundane. It contrasts Cyclops, Storm, and the X-Men going out on further missions to stop humanity from potentially bringing about the rise of a post-human existence that could render mutant evolution doomed with... well, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine and a bunch of other mutants having dinner with Christopher Summers, a.k.a. Corsair, a.k.a. Scott\u2019s dad. Normal, perfectly relatable family dinner!\n\nIn Scott\u2019s Krakoan-created house. On the moon. Specifically the former cradle of Inhumanity itself, the blue area of the moon. The view is lovely.\n\nWhy settle indeed, Cyclops. (Image: Leinil Francis Yu, Gerry Alanguilan, Sunny Gho, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nBut we\u2019re not here for the view. We\u2019re not even here for dinner. We\u2019re here for a commonality X-Men #1 shares with House and Powers: the beautifully sterile infodump interstitials designed by Tom Muller. As dinner in the Summers House gets underway, we cut to a series of pages looking at the architecture of the building and its layout.\n\nAnd friends, I can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m about to say this: it might be the fuckiest architectural blueprint ever presented in a comic book. Or in anything ever:\n\nThe House that Summers Built. (Image: Tom Muller, Marvel Comics)\n\nPlease note, the positioning of Cyclops, Wolverine, and Jean\u2019s bedrooms. Please note further, that the numerical order of these bedrooms is broken specifically to sandwich Jean\u2019s room betwixt Cyclops and Wolverine\u2019s.\n\nPlease note further still, that those three rooms are also the only three rooms with open doors connecting them together.\n\nWhat on earth \u2014 well, what on the blue area of the moon \u2014 could they need an open-door policy for?\n\n???????????????? (Image: Pepe Larraz and Marte Gracia, Marvel Comics)\n\nOh. Oh my.\n\nThis should be no surprise, of course \u2014 after all, House of X #6 showed Krakoa\u2019s newly formed government, the Quiet Council, laying down the three main laws of the mutant nation. The first was that no mutant should kill a human. The second was that all mutants should respect Krakoa, the living being they now also call their island home. The third, courtesy of Kurt Wagner, a.k.a. the Nightcrawler himself, was, well... let mutants bang.\n\nNo, really:\n\n\u201cLet. Them. Fuck.\u201d - Kurt Wagner, 2019 (Image: Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles)\n\nLiterally, Kurt got procreation woven into the very heart of mutantkind\u2019s new system of governance. The randy devil. And mere pages after that, we were treated to that aforementioned panel of Jean, Logan, and Scott seemingly rather enjoying each other\u2019s company. That, combined with the design of the Summer House Muller created in X-Men #1, and X-Men fans have been making all the eggplant and eye emojis they could muster at the trio. Because c\u2019mon, it\u2019s obvious: These mutants are banging.\n\nI guess you could say that they, and whoever else wants to get down, are just following orders. But after years of decimation, it would appear that the X-Men have a bold new mandate: the swingers party to end all swingers parties.\n\nBut behind the fun idea that Scott got Krakoa to build himself a house that specifically enabled mutant threeways, there is still this undercurrent of emotional distance and alienness to the mutants in X-Men #1, even as they go about the relatably banal periods of hanging out having dinner and relaxing in between beating up their enemies and smart apes in this issue.\n\nThere are moments of unease throughout \u2014 Polaris questioning Cyclops if he truly believes that he\u2019s fought for a better world for his family, Corsair doing the same for the bizarre grossness of Krakoa\u2019s abilities (and its plate-cleaning bio-organic goop).\n\nPolaris puts forth a question of faith. (Image: Leinil Francis Yu, Gerry Alanguilan, Sunny Gho, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nHell, even young Cable running around the Summers House calling Jean \u201cMum,\u201d and her calling him \u201cDear\u201d in response is like some kind of stilted Stepford family vibe. It all just feels, as it has since the very beginning of House of X, like there is something wrong about it all. There is love on display here, in many forms. But the feeling of it is missing. It\u2019s all distant, like empty platitudes and reassurances that everything is good and happy and apparently incredibly, incredibly horny.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before you get into that yes, gags aside, it\u2019s kind of creepy as hell how gung-ho Scott, Jean, and the rest of mutantkind are to get down to procreating them some new warriors for the cause. Is Krakoa a gilded paradise, or is it Gilead?\n\nThat\u2019s not to even get into what such a mandate means for either mutants who would rather not get down to business for solely procreative purposes (or at all!) or don\u2019t want children, or non-heteronormative members of mutant society \u2014 whether they\u2019re LGBTQ mutants, or mutants that cannot procreate through traditional means.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, in a recent Q&A with Adventures in Poor Taste, Hickman addressed that concern by saying he believed the mandate of \u201cMake More Mutants\u201d was loose enough to encompass alternate methods of pregnancy like IVF or surrogacy, or adoption processes, and not strict enough to be enacted as some kind of forced process. But that\u2019s something that has yet to be directly addressed in the text of the series itself.\n\nBut whatever ends up coming of Kurt\u2019s mandate, this is what the X-Men are in this new Dawn. Weird. Distant. Relatably unrelatable. They just happen to bone a lot more now, too.", "description": "Mutantkind has entered a bold new age.
