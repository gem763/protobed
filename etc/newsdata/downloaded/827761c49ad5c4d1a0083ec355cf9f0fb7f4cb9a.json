Our president gave the best response by launching the operation on the same day at 4pm,\u201d the official told MEE.\n\nTrump\u2019s letter was embarrassing and bizarre, and the Turkish government took it as an insult. The Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davotoglu responded to it publicly:\n\n\u201cThe Turkish nation and state were offended,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe president seems to have been the only one who didn\u2019t realize that the letter would be taken as an insult and discarded. The U.S. would have already had a hard time persuading Turkey to agree to a ceasefire if there had been no letter. Now that the letter is public knowledge, Erdogan has another reason to ignore the Trump administration\u2019s demands. The letter is the sort of thing that one would normally expect to be leaked by someone hostile to the president. In this case, the president was eager for people to know about it in the belief that it would make him look good and \u201ctough.\u201d He was passing out copies of it at the same meeting where he blew up at the Democratic leadership:\n\nThis account was given to my colleague John Nolen: At one point, Trump handed a bunch of copies of a letter he sent to Erdogan on Oct. 9 to Rep. McCarthy and asked him to pass them around to the other members. \u2014 David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) October 17, 2019\n\nThe Erdogan letter is Trump\u2019s failed foreign policy in miniature: ignorant, blustering, threatening, and ineffectual. Trump\u2019s attempts at diplomacy fail across the board for several reasons, but his basic lack of respect for the other side is an important factor in all of them. Because he knows so little, he doesn\u2019t grasp what the other governments want, and he seems to think that the only thing anyone else cares about is money because that is what matters most to him. He threatens economic ruin of whole countries in the way that he threatens to sue people, because he cannot imagine that there are interests and values more important to others than lucre. His complete lack of empathy means that he cannot understand how others perceive the world, and that means that he frequently misjudges how others will view his reckless and abusive behavior. Just as he thought the summary of the Zelensky call would vindicate him when in fact it confirmed that he had committed a flagrant abuse of power, he thinks that his letter to Erdogan was \u201cvery powerful,\u201d as he put it, when it was ridiculous and guaranteed to provoke derision and anger in Ankara. Because he surrounds himself with nothing but yes-men and flatterers, there is no one able to tell him how foolish he is, and so he makes blunder after blunder while patting himself on the back for his ingenuity.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shutterstock_677261227.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
