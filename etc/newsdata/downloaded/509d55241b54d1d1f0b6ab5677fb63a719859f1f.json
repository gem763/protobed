Spencer/Facebook More\n\nBy that, he said, he meant the Pentagon needed to coordinate efforts with other governmental agencies, including the Commerce, Treasury and Agriculture departments.\n\nAs it battles China on trade, technological and diplomatic fronts, the US government has taken several steps toward that end.\n\nIn just one example, last year Congress and US President Donald Trump expanded the review authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to include a wider variety of deals. The inter-agency body was given greater powers to halt pending transactions and unwind those already completed.\n\nWhile specific countries were not named in the legislation, the change was prompted by escalating warnings from several federal agencies that Chinese companies buying American assets could pose national security threats by transferring \u201cdual-use\u201d technologies to Beijing.\n\nIn June the Pentagon created a new office with the sole purpose of monitoring China affairs, the latest effort by the Defence Department to counter Beijing\u2019s expanding influence.\n\nSpencer said it was essential for the military services to work in tandem \u2013 and with regional US allies in Asia. \u201cWe are greater when we integrate more closely with the Marine Corps, the joint forces, [and also] our allies and our partners.\n\nWashington seeks to maintain its military engagement in the region amid escalating tensions between Beijing and some Southeast Asian nations \u2013 Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines among them \u2013 over territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries have disputed the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d Beijing has drawn around what it says are its historic claims in the region.\n\nChina has also built artificial islands, reclaimed land and installed airstrips and military equipment in the waters. Washington is not a claimant in the waters, but it has pushed its Indo-Pacific strategy to contain China's military expansion in the Pacific and Indian oceans.\n\nIn August, the US sent the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and its strike group \u2013 about 7,500 personnel, two guided-missile cruisers, a squadron of at least two destroyers or frigates, and a carrier complement of 65 to 70 aircraft \u2013 to the Philippines for a show of military might.\n\n\u201cWe're encompassing all the Pacific. I look at New Zealand, and I look at Australia \u2026 I look at what we're doing with South Korea, [and] our traditional manoeuvres with Japan,\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\"[These nations are] lead countries, playing their integral part. We have to do this together. The US is not going to land there with big boots, big ships and big guns and go \u2018follow me\u2019.\"\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nThis article US Navy secretary says countering China will require \u2018all of government\u2019 response first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "The secretary of the US Navy said on Wednesday that for the US to meet the challenge of countering the threat of China, it would need to take a page from China\u2019s playbook and employ an \u201call of government\u201d approach.Additionally, Richard Spencer said, that approach required a larger reliance on US allies", "authors": ["Lee Jeong-Ho"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/daRIUzS9rTttrt46EOvZdA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/ed2310b27410edca9c2ca1a58cf826fa", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
