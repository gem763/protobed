We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nSHEBOYGAN, Wisconsin \u2014 U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson says he was blocked by President Donald Trump from telling Ukraine's president that U.S. aid was on its way amid accusations Trump was withholding it until the eastern European nation investigated his political rival.\n\nTrump rejected Johnson's request in August after also refusing in May to back new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Oshkosh Republican told reporters Friday.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the president\u2019s reaction and realized we had a sales job to do,\u201d Johnson said during a constituent stop in Sheboygan. \u201cI tried to convince him (in August) to give me the authority to tell President Zelensky that we were going to provide that. Now, I didn\u2019t succeed.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., speaks with members of the media before meeting with the Middleton Chamber of Commerce at Serendipity Labs in Madison, Wis., Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019.

Johnson stood by the president, saying he was sympathetic to his concerns and didn't see any bad motives on his part.\n\n\"What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016? What was the truth about that?\u201d Johnson said about Trump's concerns.\n\nWith his comments Friday, Johnson made clear that he was aware of allegations Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine for political reasons weeks before the public knew.\n\nTrump, who faces a fast-moving impeachment inquiry over the matter, has denied the claim and Johnson has defended the president \u2014 but Johnson's story helps House Democrats confirm a key aspect of the probe.\n\nJohnson was part of a delegation that attended Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May. He and others briefed Trump on the inauguration and urged Trump to back Zelensky but the president resisted the idea, Johnson said Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on Sept. 25, 2019.

Volker stepped down last week and testified behind closed doors Thursday as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nJohnson told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that Sondland told him that Ukraine would appoint a prosecutor who would, as Johnson put it, work to \"get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 \u2014 if President Trump has that confidence, then he\u2019ll release the military spending.\"\n\n\u201cAt that suggestion, I winced,\u201d Johnson told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cMy reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u201d\n\nHe said he asked Trump about it and the president denied it.\n\n\"He said \u2014 expletive deleted \u2014 \u2018No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?'\u201d Johnson told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson said the call lasted 10 to 15 minutes and Trump said he was holding the money back because of corruption concerns.\n\n\u201cHe was very consistent in why he hadn\u2019t made that decision (to release the aid) yet,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Ron, do you know how fricking corrupt that place is?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump said he hadn\u2019t made a final decision but he thought Johnson would like it when he reached it, Johnson said.\n\nWhen Johsnon met with Zelensky days later, the Ukrainian president asked about the U.S. aid, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cAt no point in time did Zelensky ever mention or indicate that he was feeling pressure,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe was just concerned, he said, and by the way \u2014 far more important than the funding is just to show support.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he told Zelensky not to worry about the funding because there was unanimous support for it in Congress and lawmakers would make sure his country got it.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut was also at the meeting. Johnson said Murphy told Zelensky not to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney who has sought to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine. Murphy has given a similar account of his comments to Zelensky.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/04/ron-johnson-says-trump-blocked-him-assuring-ukraine-aid/3868691002/", "description": "Sen.
