REUTERS/Neil Hall\n\nLONDON - British lenders approved the greatest number of mortgages in two years during July, adding to signs the housing market has stabilised from its pre-Brexit slowdown, official data showed on Friday.\n\nThe Bank of England said lenders approved 67,306 mortgages, up from 66,506 in June and more than any economist predicted in a Reuters poll that had pointed to 66,167 approvals for July.\n\nBritain\u2019s housing market has sagged since the 2016 Brexit referendum - especially in London and neighbouring areas - but has shown signs of a tentative recovery in recent months.\n\nEarlier on Friday mortgage lender Nationwide said house price growth in annual terms inched up to a three-month high in August, although remained weak by recent standards.\n\nThe BoE said net mortgage lending rose by 4.611 billion pounds in July, the biggest increase since March 2016, while consumer lending increased by 0.897 billion pounds compared with a forecast rise of 1.0 billion pounds on the month.\n\nLending to businesses fell by 4.218 billion pounds last month, the sharpest fall since August 2017.
