To have the opportunity to tell his story is humbling,' said the 52-year-old.\n\nThe Kitchen Confidential author's former collaborators Lydia Tenaglia and Chris Collins will serves as consulting producers for the documentary.\n\n'Having worked with Anthony Bourdain for close to 20 years, Chris Collins and I felt very protective over the story of his life and the decision on who to direct it,\u201d Tenaglia said in a statement.\n\n'In Morgan Neville\u2019s hands, we are sure to get a nuanced portrait of the complex, wildly creative man we knew.'\n\nThe film will be produced and distributed by Focus Features, CNN Films, and HBO Max.\n\nRIP: 'Anthony Bourdain [seen here in his show Parts Unknown] did more to help us understand each other than just about anyone in the history of television,' said Neville\n\nRonan Farrow wrote in his new book Catch and Kill that many of the women he spoke to while reporting allegations of sexual misconduct ultimately refused to go on the record.\n\nThat is why he had a bad feeling when he learned that Bourdain had reached out to the editor of the New Yorker, Dave Remnick.\n\nBourdain was dating Asia Argento at the time, and the actress had detailed in graphic description how she was allegedly raped by Harvey Weinstein at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nBut rather than deliver bad news, Remnick told Farrow that Bourdain had called Weinstein's behavior 'sickening.'\n\nTook a stand: Bourdain called Harvey Weinstein's behavior 'sickening' in the wake of sexual assault allegations against the Hollywood mogul\n\nHe then added that 'everyone' knew about Weinstein's predatory practices in Hollywood.\n\n'I am not a religious man,' said Bourdain.\n\n'But I pray you have the strength to run this story.'\n\nBourdain did this after standing by Argento's side for months prior when she second guessed her decision to speak with Farrow.\n\nAs Argento grappled with her decision, her partner, the television personality Anthony Bourdain, interceded repeatedly,' writes Farrow.\n\n'He told her to keep going, that it was worth it, that it would make a difference.'\n\nAnd because of that support, Argento 'decided to go on he record,' says Farrow.\n\nBourdain would live to see his prayer answered, and then tragically take his own life just nine months after Farrow's story was published in the New Yorker.", "description": "Anthony Bourdain's 'uncommon life' is to be made into a documentary by Academy Award winning filmmaker Morgan Neville, according to a press release from the 20 Feet from Stardom helmer.", "authors": ["David Lawrance For Dailymail.Com", "Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/19/20342892-0-image-a-68_1572378670592.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
