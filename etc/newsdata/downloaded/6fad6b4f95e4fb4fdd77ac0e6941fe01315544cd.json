What may register as earthy to one person may be woody to another.\n\nSome molecules also look similar on a molecular level but when arranged in mirror images, they have differing scents - for example, caraway and spearmint. These also cause problems for the AI.\n\nThe technology could help advance systems designed to sniff out gas leaks or create perfumes (Stock image)\n\nRegardless, the researchers say its system may help to advance artificial olfaction and help it keep pace with other senses that have been bolstered or mimicked by AI.\n\n'Based on these early results with graph neural networks for molecular properties, we hope machine learning can eventually do for olfaction what it has already done for vision and hearing,' they write.\n\nOther companies like IBM have also attempted to advance the field of smell-enabled bots, employing technology that can sniff out gas leaks and even generate perfume scents.", "description": "In a new paper researchers describe how they used machine-learning to instruct a robot to accurately categorize different smells by assessing their molecular structure.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/23/20157276-0-image-a-17_1571956421925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
