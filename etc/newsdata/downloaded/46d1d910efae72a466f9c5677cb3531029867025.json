It saved my life.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "They honored the 46-year-old with humorous stories, clips from his comedy specials and TV series, heartfelt memories about working together and musical performances by artists who have performed with him over his career.\n\nAD\n\nThe audience was treated to clips of Chappelle\u2019s controversial material \u2014 from his takes on O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson to riffs on sexual assault and guns \u2014 but the performers shied away from mentioning his material on transgender people, which some critics have called hateful and transphobic.\n\nAD\n\nSeveral comics mentioned Chappelle\u2019s honesty and fearlessness. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to make fun of everybody, whether you\u2019re white or gay. End of list,\u201d joked \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Michael Che.\n\nBut Chappelle offered a thoughtful defense in his acceptance speech, saying that he would fight for every comic\u2019s right to talk about what\u2019s on their minds.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the truth and you are obstructing it. I\u2019m not talking about the content. I\u2019m talking about the art form. Do you understand?\u201d he said. \u201cThe First Amendment is first for a reason. The Second is just in case the first one doesn\u2019t work out.\n\n\u201cI love my art form,\u201d he said. \u201cIt saved my life.\u201d\n\nChappelle thanked his family, especially his wife and mother, and the performers who participated in the evening. \u201cThe thing I like the best of tonight, I saw so many people from different parts of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys have no idea how you inspire me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe thanked Washington for its welcome, too. \u201cI am honored to be a part of your community,\u201d he said, noting that D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) had proclaimed it Dave Chappelle Day.\n\nThe Duke Ellington Radical Elite Show Band filled the aisles for a rousing version of Prince\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d to open the annual gala, which raises money for the arts center\u2019s artistic and educational programs. Following tradition, Chappelle sat in a box overlooking the stage with his wife, Elaine; their three children; his mother, Yvonne Seon; and members of his extended family.\n\nStand-up comedian and actress Sarah Silverman recalled performing in a D.C. comedy club with Chappelle when they were teenagers. She praised his intelligence and focus and said receiving the Mark Twain Prize was perfect for him because \u201cyou both love using the n-word.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing about Dave,\u201d she continued. \u201cDave didn\u2019t get funny eventually. He was always funny. He\u2019s constantly evolving, he grows, he always finds some kind of new perspective. His critical thinking is his art. . . . Sometimes I wholeheartedly disagree with him. But that\u2019s what I love about Dave, what I love about art.\u201d\n\nEach aspect of Chappelle\u2019s career was highlighted in the two-hour show. Comedian Neal Brennan told the origin story of their partnership and groundbreaking Comedy Central sketch series, \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show,\u201d and described the whirlwind experience of working together.\n\n\u201cSo much of it was completely off the top of his head. He made it all up,\u201d Brennan said in a segment that was funny and sentimental. \u201cWhen we started the show, I knew Dave was the funniest person I ever met. When we ended it, I knew he was one of the funniest people to ever live.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSNL producer Lorne Michaels described his decision to ask Chappelle to make his SNL hosting debut the weekend after the 2016 presidential election, a performance Michaels described as a \u201clandmark show.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a truth-teller and the funniest person working today,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cHe was perfect that night, just as he is the perfect person to receive this prize tonight.\u201d\n\nA comic workhorse, Chappelle has performed more than 1,600 shows in the past four years. He has starred in many cable comedy specials, including four Netflix releases in 2017 and 2018. \u201cEquanimity,\u201d released last year, earned him an Emmy Award. Chappelle also has enjoyed a successful movie career, with credits that include the latest \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cChi-Raq\u201d and \u201cRobin Hood: Men in Tights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSunday\u2019s ceremony featured an unusually large number of musical acts \u2014 including performances by Common, Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def), Badu and John Legend. Their participation showcased Chappelle\u2019s connection to music, as seen in his \u201cBlock Party\u201d documentary, his Ohio music festivals and his series of 16 concerts at Radio City Music Hall in 2017 that presented popular musicians alongside comics.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot only has Dave been one of the most gifted comics to walk the Earth, he\u2019s a passionate champion of music, a curator of artists,\u201d Legend said before introducing a segment of \u201cBlock Party.\u201d\n\nJon Stewart recalled Chappelle\u2019s decision to leave his Comedy Central series, despite being offered $50 million to continue. \u201cThe courage it takes as a performer and artist to stand up for who you know you are. To take a chance on yourself. It\u2019s just one more reason . . . why we all just love and respect and admire this man,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kennedy Center first presented the Mark Twain Prize \u2014 honoring a lifetime contribution to American humor \u2014 to Richard Pryor in 1998. Past winners include Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Lily Tomlin and Billy Crystal.\n\nAD", "description": "The comedian, a Washington native, is saluted in Kennedy Center ceremony by his peers, including Sarah Silverman and Jon Stewart.", "authors": ["Peggy Mcglone", "Reporter Covering The Arts In The Washington Region"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/q2X5NMWoqjoe7Fep5FbTdUdgZxI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6VVCESHZDYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
