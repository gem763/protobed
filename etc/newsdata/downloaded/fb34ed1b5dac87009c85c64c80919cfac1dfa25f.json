Of course he lost his money and he had to pay for the van he was renting or hiring.\n\n\"He had further appointments and he decided not to go because he'd be in debt, he didn't have the resources, he didn't go.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: RichardCrease/BNPS)\n\nMr Loach said the van driver gradually fell ill, before he collapsed and died after missing his third appointment.\n\nThe director added: \"Now you tell me that's justified, you tell me that's right - that a worker is so terrified to have a day off for sickness because he'll be fined and therefore he dies. That's the gig economy, that's what it's doing to working people.\"\n\nThe Question Time audience cheered and applauded at the end of Mr Loach's speech.\n\nThe socialist director was praised for his passionate rant on Twitter .\n\nOne user wrote: \"Ken Loach is a bit of a working class hero, but he's not just telling a story here. This sort of thing is common place in the USA, and the shift in British society towards the US model needs no imagination to see what it will mean for workers. Employment laws need protecting!\"\n\nElizabeth Costello tweeted: \"We owe so much to film director Ken Loach @KenLoachSixteen his films have highlighted social realistic issues giving a voice to the many people who don\u2019t have one #gigeconomy #bbcqt .\"\n\nAnother person said: \"Actually Ken Loach talking sense tonight, he was spot on about exploitation of gig workers on zero hour contracts, let's get real here, it's exploitation, it's a bad road to go down I wouldn't blanket ban them but there has to be a better way forward & they need phasing out #bbcqt .\"", "description": "Director Ken Loach was dubbed a 'working class hero' after he slammed the gig economy in his incredible Question Time tirade", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Bbc", "Richardcrease Bnps"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20719851.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ken-Loach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
