Gouache and graphite pencil on paper. (\u00a9 The Maurice Sendak Foundation. The Morgan Library & Museum, Bequest of Maurice Sendak, 2013.107:262. Photography by Janny Chiu.)\n\nA new exhibit highlights Sendak\u2019s set and costume designs for opera and ballet.\n\nBy the 1970s, Maurice Sendak was one of the greatest living writers and illustrators of children\u2019s books. He had written and illustrated Where the Wild Things Are in 1963 and In the Night Kitchen in 1970. He had also created art for stories by the Brothers Grimm and Isaac Bashevis Singer. In 1978, at the height of his artistic powers, at the ripe age of 50, he was commissioned by opera director Frank Corsaro to design sets and costumes for a Houston Grand Opera production of Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute. This commission launched Sendak on a new and exciting \u2014 and much lesser-known \u2014 venture, as a set and costume designer for operas and ballets. \u201cDrawing the Curtain,\u201d the first exhibit of its kind (ongoing at the Morgan Library & Museum until October 6), explores this fascinating second act of Sendak\u2019s career, which included set and costume designs for almost a dozen operatic and balletic productions, most prominent among them The Magic Flute, Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s The Cunning Little Vixen, Prokofiev\u2019s Love for Three Oranges, Tchaikovsky\u2019s The Nutcracker, and an opera based on Sendak\u2019s own Where the Wild Things Are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationship between Sendak and opera would prove to be a mutually beneficial and mutually influential one. As Sendak brought his signature style \u2014 at once whimsical and mystical, entrancing and haunting, part Brothers Grimm meets William Blake, part Venetian Renaissance painting meets German Romanticism, with touches of El Greco, Van Gogh, and Walt Disney\u2019s Fantasia \u2014 to Mozart\u2019s most famous opera, Sendak in turn brought Mozart into his books. While working on his designs for The Magic Flute, Sendak began work on his next classic, Outside Over There, a book in which the presence of Mozart is as clear as the magnificent contrapuntal finale in the final movement of Mozart\u2019s Jupiter symphony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plot of Outside Over There, Sendak\u2019s most personal book (\u201can excavation of my soul,\u201d as he described it), centers on a young girl named Ida who attempts to save her baby sister, who has been kidnapped by goblins, by playing a \u201cwonder horn\u201d to \u201ccatch those goblins with a tune.\u201d (The Magic Flute, of course, features a magical musical instrument that the young prince Tamino uses to subdue wild animals and to withstand Sarastro\u2019s tests.) Mozart himself makes a cameo in the book \u2014 the shadowy little cottage featured in it is in fact a stylized depiction of the forest cabin in which Mozart composed the bulk of The Magic Flute. In Sendak\u2019s design for the show scrim that introduces The Magic Flute, he features the great composer himself. In a watercolor on display near the beginning of the exhibit, we see Mozart again inside his forest cabin, this time in silhouette, surrounded by fantastical Wild Thing\u2013like creatures (meant to be the drei knaben\u2014the three child spirits of the opera) receiving the gifts of musical inspiration.\n\nThe Morgan is fortunate \u2014 as are we, as spectators \u2014 to have been bequeathed over 900 objects by Sendak from his operatic and balletic designs, enabling them to put on such a wondrous exhibit. It features only a small sampling of Sendak\u2019s sketches, storyboards, studies, watercolors, and dioramas, but they are more than enough to fill an entire gallery, and more than enough to spark further interest in Sendak as not only a great author and illustrator but also as a disciplined artist who was intimately familiar with the canon of classical music and who drew upon \u2014 while drawing for \u2014 opera and classical music in his writings.\n\nAs careful readers of Outside Over There can see, classical music was integral to his work. \u201cI can hardly live without\u201d music, Sendak said in a 1966 interview:\n\nI do most of my work to music, and music plays an extremely important part in my work. Depending on what I\u2019m doing at the moment, there is always a specific kind of music I want to listen to. All composers have different colors, as all artists do, and I kind of pick up the right color from either Haydn or Mozart or Wagner while I\u2019m working. And very often I will switch recordings endlessly until I get the right color and the right note and the right sound and then settle down happily to whatever I\u2019m doing.\n\nSendak told others that with Outside Over There he was trying to write \u201can opera with pictures.\u201d At the same time, his designs for opera and ballet were no mere sideshows to his authorial efforts \u2014 as the magnificent illustrations and set designs on display at the Morgan make manifest. New York Times art critic John Russell asserted that \u201cif he felt like it, he need never do anything but design for the opera house.\u201d\n\nFor Sendak, the invitation to design the costume and sets for The Magic Flute was the opportunity of a lifetime \u2014 a chance to bring to life his favorite opera by his most beloved composer, with his own visual language and aesthetic sensibility. Sendak was initially somewhat intimidated by the prospect and was also apprehensive about working in the three-dimensional world of the stage after having worked for so long in the two-dimensional world of books. He wrote to his friend Tony Kushner, \u201cI worry a good deal (as you know) about the possible dire effects of thirty years\u2019 worth of composing for the page on my stage designs. Have I, in fact, been able to bridge the gap between the two disciplines?\u201d But once Sendak became more comfortable drawing for the stage, he took to it with gusto.\n\nAs much as he venerated Mozart, however, Sendak was not entirely faithful to the great composer\u2019s work. Ever the impish artist \u2014 much like his two most famous child protagonists, Mickey and Max \u2014 Sendak brought his mischievous side to The Magic Flute, playing up the opera\u2019s allusions to Freemasonry by making some of the characters Freemasons (Mozart himself was a Freemason), and suffusing the stage with set designs that were an eclectic and eccentric m\u00e9lange of William Blake\u2019s mystical romanticism, Christian symbolism, medieval and Renaissance motifs, Art Deco extravagance, Borscht Belt kitsch, and ancient Egyptian architectural grandeur. Many of his designs for The Magic Flute were heavily indebted to Blake in particular, and the Morgan helpfully juxtaposes copies of Blake\u2019s illustrations with Sendak\u2019s in order to highlight the ways in which Sendak\u2019s storyboards for The Magic Flute quote from Blake\u2019s Behemoth and Leviathan (1805) and Milton\u2019s Mysterious Dream (1816).\n\nFollowing Sendak\u2019s and Corsaro\u2019s successful collaboration on The Magic Flute, the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, England, asked them to create a new production of Prokofiev\u2019s Love of Three Oranges. Corsaro and Sendak decided to set the opera during the time of the French Revolution, a setting rather different from that of the typical Sendak creation. Consequently, Sendak at first suffered a bout of artist\u2019s block until he came upon the drawings of the Venetian artist Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo (1727\u20131804). Newly inspired, he set to work. Sendak borrowed so liberally from Tiepolo in his set designs for Prokofiev\u2019s satirical opera \u2014 about a prince who is cursed to love three oranges (each of which contains a princess) \u2014 that he confessed to Corsaro that his borrowings amounted to artistic theft: \u201cIt is an odd matter indeed, this almost magical union that occurs between stealer and stealee: it is as though I know what I want but can see it only inside (in this case) a Tiepolo drawing and then I can draw it out and make it properly my own.\u201d\n\nBeyond illuminating the extent of Tiepolo\u2019s influence on him \u2014 as can be seen in the exhibit\u2019s placement of their drawings side by side \u2014 Sendak\u2019s comments raise age-old questions about the nature of artistic originality and the line between artistic borrowing and artistic stealing: Should artistic stealing be thought of as some sort of crime on the part of the artist? Is it something that \u2014 rather like coaching during a tennis match \u2014 everyone does but few are called out for and fewer still fess up to? Sendak did admit to it, and for that, he at least deserves recognition for his honesty. \u201cI have an unshakable faith in the people I steal from,\u201d Sendak said, a practice which, say what one will about the ethics of it, proved to be artistically fruitful, both for Sendak and for us as enjoyers of his art.\n\nThe first production of the opera version of Where the Wild Things Are was held at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royale de la Monnaie in Brussels on November 28, 1980. The score, written by the British composer Oliver Knussen, is strikingly Stravinskyian, recalling the great modernist Russian composer\u2019s then-shocking (and now-classic) Le Sacre du printemps, with its clashing chords and atonality \u2014 ideally suited to the disruptiveness and disorderliness of Max\u2019s clash with his mother and his nocturnal, nautical journey to the lawless world of the Wild Things. Audio guides available for this exhibit include musical selections from each of the operas and ballets featured in it, including Knussen\u2019s innovative score, and a video display at the entrance of the gallery shows highlights from Sendak\u2019s and Corsaro\u2019s operatic collaborations, making the exhibit a truly immersive audio-visual experience.\n\nIn addition to being able to glimpse three-dimensional versions of Sendak\u2019s famed creatures, longtime lovers of Where the Wild Things Are like myself may learn new things about Sendak\u2019s most beloved book, such as the ways in which Sendak\u2019s Jewish background crept into Where the Wild Things Are: Some of the Wild Things have Yiddish names (such as Tzippy); the design for Max\u2019s mother (at least in the operatic adaptation) is based on a caricature of a Yiddishe mama so stereotypical it would make Alexander Portnoy blush; and, perhaps most interestingly, the design for the Wild Thing \u201cMoishe\u201d is based on Sendak himself \u2014 it is a kind of self-portrait of the artist as a Wild Thing. (Maurice Sendak was called \u201cMoishe\u201d as a boy).\n\nFor his version of The Nutcracker, Sendak, ever the Mozart devotee, altered Tchaikovsky\u2019s ballet to make it more closely align with fellow Mozart aficionado E. T. A. Hoffmann\u2019s original 1816 tale The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, the story upon which the ballet is based. (Hoffman was such a Mozart enthusiast that he changed his middle name to Amadeus.) Sendak sexualized the ballet in subtle but significant ways, most prominently in making Clara, the Nutcracker\u2019s female protagonist, twelve years old (as she is in Hoffmann\u2019s original story) rather than seven years old (as she is in Tchaikovsky\u2019s ballet). Whether it is preferable for balletic adaptations of the Nutcracker to be more faithful to Hoffmann\u2019s original, somewhat more troubling tale or whether it is more desirable to stick to Tchaikovsky\u2019s G-rated version \u2014 which Sendak deemed \u201cbland and banal\u201d \u2014 is an open question, but what is unquestionable is Sendak\u2019s adoration of Mozart, whom he referred to as \u201ca god I could really respect, because he was an artist.\u201d Sendak even went so far as to feature a bust of Mozart in his set design for the ballet, unmistakably signaling to the audience that they were no longer in Tchaikovsky\u2019s musical and artistic universe.\n\nThe exhibit also juxtaposes Sendak\u2019s drawings for Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s opera The Cunning Little Vixen with illustrations from Romantic artists such as Samuel Palmer and Caspar David Friedrich. In his design for this opera, which takes place in less urban, more naturalistic settings, Sendak drew not only on the European Romantics but on his own love of nature. (He is reported to have spent a good deal of time walking in the forests near his Ridgefield, Conn., home.)\n\nSendak\u2019s work is renowned for its playfulness and whimsicality, but there are darker, more haunting aspects of it as well. \u201cDrawing the Curtain\u201d does not shy away from these aspects of his work, thereby giving us a more complete picture of Sendak\u2019s complex artistry. Sendak was born in Brooklyn in June 1928 to a family of Polish Jewish immigrants. Most of his extended family, who were not so fortunate as to make it to America prior to 1939, perished at the hands of the Nazis. The nightmare of the Holocaust (and very likely a speck of survivor\u2019s guilt as well) tormented Sendak and his family throughout his life, and the specter of pernicious, life-threatening human actors lurking in what we might na\u00efvely assume to be safe, innocent spaces consequently looms large in his books, particularly in In the Night Kitchen and Outside Over There. Sendak chose to respond to the horrors of history not through politics and activism but by deepening his engagement with art. \u201cOne has to listen to [Mozart\u2019s] music, one just has to look at Vincent [van Gogh]\u2019s paintings to have hope. . . . Certainly it gives me hope.\u201d Sendak\u2019s response to this familial, national, and historical trauma \u2014 the creation of a canon of classical children\u2019s literature as well as his work on productions of beloved operas and ballets \u2014 has given hope, joy, and countless hours of wonder to a myriad of children and adults across the globe.\n\nIn 1990, Sendak co-founded The Night Kitchen Theater, a theater company for children, combining his passion for writing for children with his new-found passion for theater production design. Though the exhibit does not touch on Sendak\u2019s work with The Night Kitchen Theater, one gets the sense that designing sets and costumes for theatrical and musical productions specifically meant for children must have given him a special kind of fulfillment that he did not obtain from either his writing of books or from his designs for opera alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLastly, in a portion of the exhibit that can easily be overlooked, Sendak\u2019s interest in three-dimensional toys is showcased in two mechanical sculptures of Pinocchio and Little Red Riding Hood that he created with his brother Jack (with some assistance from their sister Natalie) in 1948. These sculptures, constructed with painted wood, textiles, string, and metal, are both fairly small \u2014 each is no larger than about the size of a softball \u2014 but they may be some of Sendak\u2019s most fascinating creations. In the Little Red Riding Hood sculpture, the wolf lying calmly in bed looks truly monstrous. The straw-yellows, tomato-reds and lime-greens recall Van Gogh\u2019s color palette. The bare wooden chair next to the bed also evokes Sendak\u2019s favorite painter. The sculpture is discomfiting in a way that a Van Gogh painting of a Brothers Grimm fairy tale would be discomfiting \u2014 intense, vibrant, mildly anxiety-inducing, somewhat bewildering, bordering on the hallucinatory, and inescapably transfixing.\n\nThe Pinocchio sculpture is somewhat more \u201cchildlike,\u201d if you will \u2014 a bit more placid, filled with traditional children\u2019s toys such as a rocking horse, a toy soldier, a rubber ball, a duck-shaped ship, and what looks like a \u201cgood witch\u201d grasping a wand. All of these objects surround Pinocchio \u2014 who looks more like a scarecrow than the Pinocchio we might be more familiar with from the Disney movie \u2014 dressed in a lime-green suit, red mittens, green-bean-colored pants, and black shoes. Even in this seemingly innocent scene danger lurks: The duck-shaped ship bears an ominous-looking red insignia reminiscent of something that would be seen on a pirate ship; a jagged saw looms over Pinocchio\u2019s head; and the right side of the sculpture depicts Pinocchio playing with a jack-in-a-box, a coiled, serpent-like toy perhaps symbolizing the element of surprise (and possible danger) lurking even in childhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brothers Sendak tried to sell the toys to FAO Schwarz but were rebuffed; perhaps executives of the famed New York toy store deemed these toys too frightening for children. The failed attempt, did, however, lead to Maurice\u2019s meeting Ursula Nordstrom, who at that time worked at FAO Schwarz and who would later become his editor and longtime champion. Sendak\u2019s early fascination with pop-up books, mechanical toys, and still objects that come to life would come through later in the fantasy sequence in Where the Wild Things Are wherein Max\u2019s bed pops up and begins to transform into a tree and his bedroom metamorphoses into a lush, thickly forested jungle-like landscape.\n\n\u201cDrawing the Curtain\u201d is on a superficial level a fun exhibit for Sendak fans that explores his diverting second act, his post-midlife career as an opera and ballet scenographer. However, it is much more than that: It is one of the best arguments for high-quality children\u2019s literature that I have ever come across. Seeing the way in which Sendak was influenced by (and liberally borrowed from) his artistic predecessors, and learning of his thoroughgoing love of classical music, makes one realize that to read Sendak to one\u2019s children is not simply to read them entertaining bedtime stories; it is to open them up to the whole world of classical art, literature, and music \u2014 to Mozart and Tchaikovsky, to Van Gogh and Tiepolo, to Winslow Homer and Antoine Watteau, to Jan\u00e1\u010dek and Prokofiev, and to William Blake and Herman Melville (whose writing Sendak greatly admired) and E. T. A. Hoffmann, to English and German Romanticism and to the Italian Renaissance, to Enlightenment empiricism and the French Age of Reason and the world of classic American film (Sendak credited King Kong as an important influence upon his Wild Things). The journey from Sendak\u2019s books to the great works of world art \u2014 like Max\u2019s journey from the tranquil domesticity of his bedroom to the raucous natural world of the Wild Things \u2014 is only a single boat-ride of the imagination away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter seeing this exhibit, I can\u2019t help but think that the person I am today \u2014 like Sendak, a wonderstruck worshiper at the artistic altars of the Italian Renaissance and German Romanticism, a writer of strange stories and idiosyncratic fiction of my own \u2014 is in large part the result of being fed a steady diet of Sendak (with Where the Wild Things Are being my usual main course) as a child. While I may have departed from Sendak in certain key ways \u2014 his musical deity was Mozart; mine is Beethoven \u2014 I remain very much his child, a free-thinking, non-conforming, art-and-music-loving Wild Thing living in two worlds at once \u2014 in the mundane world of history, the world of trauma and suffering and prosaicness, and in the imaginative world of art and literature, the world of creativity and sublimity and of ever-abiding hope for transcendence. Like my brothers Max and Mickey \u2014 and my sister Ida \u2014 I suspect that I am far from the only one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGive me the child till he is seven,\u201d the Jesuits used to say, \u201cand I shall give you the man.\u201d Give your children to Sendak \u2014 and to other great works of children\u2019s literature \u2014 and who knows how far they will go in intellectual and imaginative journeys of their own. Give your children Sendak, and let the wild rumpus begin.", "description": "A new exhibit highlights the children's author's little-known second career.", "authors": ["Daniel Ross Goodman", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "Kevin D.
