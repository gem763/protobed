It is not something we decide \u2013 it\u2019s World Rugby\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nEngland are due to announce their team to face France on Thursday morning and even if the game does go ahead, Billy Vunipola, Joe Marler and Jack Nowell will almost certainly be missing.\n\nVunipola, the Saracens number eight Eddie Jones dare not lose, twisted his left ankle against Argentina last Saturday and it is hoped he will recover in time for the quarter-final against Wales or Australia.\n\nMarler and Nowell were also hurt against the Pumas and England are unlikely to take any risks with their respective back and hamstring injuries.\n\nReturning to the treatment room is a bitter pill for Nowell to swallow after he made his long-awaited comeback at Tokyo Stadium following months of battling an ankle problem.\n\nThe Exeter wing also had his appendix removed during the squad\u2019s heat camp in Treviso in early September, further delaying his recovery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little hamstring injury. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Jack will be getting slightly frustrated,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cWe feel for him because he had the return from the injury he had in the Premiership final, then appendicitis and then another little niggle.\n\n\u201cBut you saw a moment of brilliance for his try against Argentina \u2013 that upper body strength and power \u2013 and he will have taken a lot of satisfaction from that.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones\u00b4 side are set to play their final Pool C game on Saturday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/wire-19480088-1570606717-676_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
