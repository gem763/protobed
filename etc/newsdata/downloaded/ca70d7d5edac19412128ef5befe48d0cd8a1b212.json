There's no chance we'll even discipline him.\"\n\nSilver's comments underscore the tense situation for the league while it was in China last week for preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nBASKETBALL DIPLOMACY:Are LeBron and NBA right to bow to China?\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet set off a geopolitical firestorm that resulted in China not showing the two Nets-Lakers games on TV or the Internet, the loss of sponsorship money and a raft of criticism for the NBA and Lakers superstar LeBron James, who criticized Morey.\n\nThe NBA is still dealing with the fallout, which will have an economic impact on the league\u2019s bottom line. Silver indicated the losses are in the millions.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY:How much is at stake for the NBA in China?\n\n\"The losses have already been substantial,\" he said. \"Our games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\n\n\"I don't know where we go from here. The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\"\n\nThe league was concerned China might cancel the preseason games, and several events around the game, including a Special Olympics event and press conferences with Silver and players, were canceled. It was happening by the minute as China\u2019s fury grew.\n\nThe NBA managed to subdue China\u2019s anger, at least enough to play the games, albeit with sponsorship decals removed from the court.\n\nPR NIGHTMARE:Will LeBron's remarks on China hurt image, sales?\n\nSilver conceded the NBA\u2019s initial response to the situation in China may have been too diplomatic, but ultimately, Silver stood firm in the face of pressure from China.\n\n\"These American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go,\" Silver said. \"And one of those values is free expression. We wanted to make sure that everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\"\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "description": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday the Chinese government and partners asked the NBA to fire Daryl Morey fired, but Silver staunchly refused.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/17/USAT/060ac52e-f617-4fdc-b2f9-64a0469a8883-2019-10-17_Daryl_Morey2.JPG?crop=2890,2168,x389,y337&width=2886&height=2168&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
