You do not realise it is an epidemic as it happens privately,\u201d he told AFP at the Betting on Sports conference in London.\n\n\u201cWe cannot reverse technology (the apps) we have put in the market and unfortunately bookies do seem to find legislation heavy-handed and want to self-legislate. But they have made so much money it is a tricky place to be in.\u201d\n\nWoodhams believes raising the age limit from 18 is a logical step.\n\n\u201cMy view on principle is you should not bet until you are 21. We (Fitzdares) are probably the only ones who restrict it to 21 and over,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy opinion is a student loan or money from your first job should not be spent on gambling.\n\n\u201cOf course I advocate going racing and to football matches but I just think the other things you can do at 18 like voting is one thing, army is another and driving a car another.\n\n\u201cHowever, spending money on sport needs another level of thought and maybe I am being rude to 18-year-olds but I think 21 is the right age.\n\n\u201cI was betting aged 16 but got my fingers burnt and stopped and learned my lesson that way.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Life lessons\u2019 \u2013\n\nWoodhams also believes that bookies talking about the perils of betting has a limited impact.\n\n\u201cThe advertisements on TV educating you on betting are being paid for by bookmakers,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not ask Johnnie Walker how much I should drink.\u201d\n\nIn its report last year, the Gambling Commission said 14 percent of 11 to 16-year-olds had spent their own money on gambling in the previous week \u2014 compared to 13 percent who had drunk alcohol.\n\nTypes of betting included private bets with friends, National Lottery scratchcards and fruit machines.\n\nThe bishop of St Albans, Alan Smith, has described the number of young gamblers as a \u201cgenerational scandal\u201d and demanded the dangers be taken seriously.\n\nGraham Weir, founder and CEO of Safer Gambling Solutions, which advises firms on reducing gambling-related harm, believes education is the key.\n\n\u201cIt is potentially a problem area but also a big opportunity,\u201d he said after chairing a panel on the topic of leadership in safer gambling at the CasinoBeats Summit.\n\n\u201cI believe passionately it would be a good thing to do if we can educate the next generation of gamblers that you will not get rich on the back of it and it is neither sexy nor glamorous, and on the dangers of it.\u201d\n\nWeir, who was previously group director of responsible gambling for bookmaking giants Ladbrokes Coral, said educational establishments also have a responsibility.\n\n\u201cOn the school curriculum we teach them about sex, making money and taking drugs but for me it should be part of the curriculum at school and for young adults going to university as part of freshers\u2019 week.\n\n\u201cTeaching not that it is bad for you but, like everything else you do, you should not drive too quickly or drink too much. It is one of the life lessons you need to learn.\n\n\u201cTo educate is better than dealing with the effects of people who go into gambling in blissful ignorance.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Raising the minimum legal age for betting and boosting education could be effective tools to tackle the scourge of problem gambling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/1fcc0d_odds-are-displayed-aintree-racecourse-in-liverpool-british-gambling-industry-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
