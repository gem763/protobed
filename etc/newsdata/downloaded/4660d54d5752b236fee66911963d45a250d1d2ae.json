Instead, he\u2019ll be luxuriating off-screen in everyone\u2019s fourth-favorite island country: England! Empire showrunner Brett Mahoney confirmed to TVLine that Smollett\u2019s character and his new husband, Kai, will take their honeymoon phase away from the mean, music-obsessed streets of New York City. \u201cJamal is taking a sabbatical from the family,\u201d Mahoney explained. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be caught up in Lyon family drama, which is very much in keeping with his point of view last season \u2014 that the family business should be something that the family moves away from. Jamal and Kai have decided to stay in London.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Smollett claimed he was on the receiving end of a racist, homophobic attack from two men on a late Chicago evening. He was soon charged with filing a false police report, and prosecutors were subsequently able to lay out how Smollett allegedly planned his own attack. He pleaded not guilty to 16 felony counts, and the criminal charges against him were eventually dropped by Cook County. Still, the City of Chicago is currently suing Smollett for investigation fees that exceed $130,000.", "description": "Jussie Smollett will indeed be written out of Empire for its upcoming final season, where the show will keep him in London permanently.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/05/09/09-jussie-smollett-empire.w1200.h630.jpg"}
