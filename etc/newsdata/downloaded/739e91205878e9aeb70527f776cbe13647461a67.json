Recently, Lindbergh photographed women for the Forces for Change issue of British Vogue, guest-edited by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, including Jane Fonda, the climate activist Greta Thunberg, and New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.\n\nOn the duke and duchess\u2019s official Instagram account, Meghan shared an image of herself with the photographer, captioned: \u201cHis work is revered globally for capturing the essence of a subject and promoting healthy ideals of beauty, eschewing photoshopping, and preferring natural beauty with minimal makeup.\u201d\n\nLindbergh was born in German-occupied Poland in 1944 and studied at the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts in the early 60s, before opening his own studio in 73. He became known for his naturalistic style, shooting models who wore minimal makeup.\n\nPeter Lindbergh's best photograph: the birth of the supermodels Read more\n\nSpeaking to the Observer in 2016, he said: \u201cThe cosmetic companies have everyone brainwashed. I don\u2019t retouch anything. \u2018Oh, but she looks tired!\u2019 they say. So what if she looks tired? Tired and beautiful.\u201d\n\nLindbergh was also credited with launching the 90s \u201csupermodel era\u201d, after photographing models including Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford for the cover of British Vogue in 1990. He was the first photographer to shoot the Pirelli calendar three times, taking the helm in 1996, 2002 and 2017.\n\nHis realistic style of fashion photography came at a time when the industry was dominated by images of glamour and excess. His pared-back style is often credited with redefining beauty ideals, and he saw it as a photographer\u2019s responsibility to \u201cfree women, and finally everyone, from the terror of youth and perfection\u201d.\n\nPeter Lindbergh: \u2018I don\u2019t retouch anything\u2019 Read more\n\nAside from his work as a fashion photographer, Lindbergh shot the cover of Beyonce\u2019s 2008 album I Am \u2026 Sasha Fierce and, in 1994, shot Madonna in a tribute to Martha Graham. He also directed films including Models: The Film in 1991 and Inner Voices in 1999, which won the best documentary award at the Toronto film festival, and shot the poster for the 1983 erotic horror film The Hunger, featuring David Bowie, Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve..\n\nA post on Lindbergh\u2019s Instagram account on Wednesday confirmed his death, stating: \u201cHe leaves a big void\u201d. The editor of British Vogue, Edward Enninful, has also paid tribute, saying: \u201cPeter Lindbergh was both a visionary photographer and a dear friend. His ability to see real beauty in people, and the world, was ceaseless, and will live on through the images he created.
