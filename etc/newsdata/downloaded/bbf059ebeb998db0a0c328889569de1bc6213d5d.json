US lobbyists are trying to foist the meat from diseased chickens on our children,\" Barry Gardiner, the opposition Labour party's Shadow International Trade Secretary, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added: \"A Johnson-Trump post-Brexit trade deal would put the interests of American farmers before the British public. It would lead to an influx of cheap US food produced to lower standards.\"\n\nLobbyists for the US poultry industry told Business Insider that \"protectionism\" in the UK must come to an end.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Chicken Council, based in Washington, told Business Insider the US poultry industry \"would welcome the opportunity to compete in the UK market,\" adding that \"unfortunately, this issue isn't about poultry - its always been about politics and protectionism.\"\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation said in a statement: \"The issue of 'chlorine-chicken' from the US is often brought up in Britain as a reason against having a US-UK agreement, but there's no reason this has to be a show stopper.\n\nIt added: \"In the end, we want science-based measures that do not block trade. Food-safety standards and biotechnology measures should improve agricultural and food trade rather than function as a form of protectionism.\"\n\nUK food industry fears influx of cheaper US products\n\nRichard Griffiths, Chief Executive of the British Poultry Council, told Business Insider that any UK government move to compromise food standards would be \"unacceptable\" and threaten \"high standards of production from farm to fork.\"\n\nHe told Business Insider: \"If food produced to lower standards is allowed to enter the British market, it will create a 2-tier food system, in which only the affluent can afford to eat British food grown to British standards.\n\n\"We're determined to carry on putting food on every table and ensuring British food remain accessible and affordable for all. That is why we're calling for a Government-wide commitment that production standards of imported food will have to meet British standards as a condition of entry.\"\n\nJohnson abandons UK promise to stick with EU food standards\n\nLast week Johnson reportedly ditched a previous UK commitment to maintain a \"level playing field\" with the EU after Brexit, paving the way for his government to ditch EU standards for the environment and workers' rights.\n\n\n\nHis predecessor Theresa May had agreed to stick with these EU rules in exchange for access to the single market.\n\nHowever, UK negotiators are keen to move away from these rules, particularly those relating to food, as Britain prepares to leave the EU's customs union and have an independent trading policy, the Independent reported.\n\nMoreover, a government document obtained by The Financial Times warned that striking a free trade deal with the US would \"severely limit\" the UK's ability to negotiate a comprehensive post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.\n\nBill Esterson, the Labour Party's Shadow Minister for Business and International Trade, has been tracking the behaviour of US industry lobbyists ahead of a potential trade agreement between the US and the UK.\n\nHe told Business Insider: \"A trade deal that sells British producers and consumers down the river will only make us poorer. We want policies that lead to better results for our producers and better food on our plates and in our kitchens.\n\n\"Policy that is made in the interest of the US poultry industry will only be to their benefit at the expense of our industry and our consumers.\"\n\nChuka Umunna, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, said: \"We have already heard this week how Tory ministers are willing to get rid of our food safety standards as they desperately try to replace the trade we have with the world's largest trading bloc - the EU - for a deal with Donald Trump.\n\n\"This serves to show that the risk the US will to try and take advantage of our weakened position if we leave the EU is high.\n\n\"We haven't even left yet and countries are already queuing up to benefit from the economic disaster Boris Johnson wants to plunge us into.\"\n\nAsked this week about the prospect of a trade deal with the US, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Johnson said: \"The government has been clear that we have no plans to reduce any of our standards.\"", "description": "The US government has been clear that a free trade deal with the UK must include food and agriculture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9328/1ad0c30a54c248feb6a42e0ea843881a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
