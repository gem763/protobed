His showbiz ascent started with spots on \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" where he was known as the \"crying comedian.\"\n\n\"I sat on a stool telling jokes, and nobody was laughing,\" he told UPI in 1992. \"In desperation, I pretended to cry as I begged them to laugh. That killed 'em.\"\n\nHe'd go on to make over 2,000 guest appearances on shows including \"Hollywood Squares\" and \"The Gong Show,\" and host the beauty pageant spoof \"The $1.98 Beauty Show.\"\n\nHe was known for his over-the-top persona with a fondness for throwing confetti at the audience.\n\nLEGENDARY CREAM DRUMMER DEAD AT 80\n\nHe also played himself in \"Wayne's World 2\" and the \"Jackass\" movies, appeared on stage in \"Sugar Babies\" and \"Oliver!\" and performed an autobiographical one-man play, \"It Ain't All Confetti.\"\n\nWith his bushy blonde toupee, exaggerated eyebrows and walrus-like mustache, Taylor was a striking presence.
