Photo: The Cut\n\nSo, you\u2019re working with someone whose work isn\u2019t exactly what you need it to be, and you need to ask them to do it differently. Maybe you\u2019re their manager, or maybe you\u2019re a peer who\u2019s overseeing the project they\u2019re working on. Maybe the correction is relatively minor, or maybe it\u2019s a big deal. Either way, if you\u2019re like a lot of people, having to tell a colleague that they\u2019re doing something wrong makes you anxious. But if it\u2019s done well, giving constructive criticism doesn\u2019t have to be awkward or unpleasant for you or your co-worker. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n\n1. First, know that giving and receiving corrections at work is very, very normal.\n\nIt\u2019s both common and normal to need to make tweaks to a project or the way someone is approaching their work. Part of that is because none of us are mind readers and so people aren\u2019t always on the same page initially about how a project should play out. Part of it is that none of us are perfect, and we make mistakes or approach things sub-optimally. Corrective feedback isn\u2019t a referendum on anyone\u2019s value as a person \u2014 it\u2019s just a normal and expected part of the process of improving work.\n\n2. Put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling anxious about giving someone feedback, put yourself in their shoes. Do you resent your own manager when she asks you to approach something differently? Or does it feel like a pretty normal and expected interaction? (It should be the latter, assuming your manager doesn\u2019t handle feedback like a jerk.) Plus, you probably want to know how you could improve your work and wouldn\u2019t appreciate someone withholding important feedback from you out of fear of awkwardness \u2014 thus leaving you to repeat the same mistake or work quality problem over and over. Assume that whoever you need to deliver feedback to also appreciates knowing how to make their work better.\n\nThis is important for everyone, but it\u2019s especially crucial for managers. You can\u2019t shy away from giving your employees feedback if you\u2019re the one in charge; you have a professional and ethical obligation to talk to them about where they stand and how they could do better.\n\n3. Be thoughtful about your timing.\n\nWhile you need to be committed to giving feedback if you manage people or projects, that doesn\u2019t mean that you should give it whenever it occurs to you without thinking about your timing. If someone is having a tough day or a tough week, or if they\u2019re clearly harried and focused on something higher-priority, wait until they\u2019re in a calmer and more receptive place. (That said, don\u2019t wait forever. Some bad weeks stretch into bad months, and you can\u2019t put feedback on hold for that long. But if the circumstances allow for it, try to be emotionally intelligent about your timing.)\n\n4. Don\u2019t serve up a feedback sandwich.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever read a management book, you\u2019ve probably heard of the \u201cfeedback sandwich\u201d: a technique where you sandwich criticism in between two compliments. The idea is that by praising the person at the start and end, you\u2019ll make it easier for them to accept the criticism.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad technique. Don\u2019t use it! For one thing, people will pick up on what you\u2019re doing and your praise will start to seem insincere. People will also start bracing for criticism every time you praise them. Plus, if you bury your real message in the middle of the conversation, it can get lost.\n\n5. Be matter-of-fact.\n\nThe person receiving your feedback is likely to take their cues from you. If you sound tense and worried about their reaction, or uncomfortable having the conversation at all, people are much more likely to react as if this is a tense, uncomfortable conversation. Even if you do secretly feel anxious, showing that will only make the conversation harder on the other person. The best thing you can do is be matter-of-fact \u2014 as if this is just like any other work conversation. Think of the tone you\u2019d use to say \u201chmmm, the printer needs more toner,\u201d or \u201ccould you grab that call for me so I\u2019m not late to my meeting?\u201d You want a similar tone here.\n\nBy approaching the conversation matter-of-factly, you\u2019ll convey: \u201cthis is normal, it isn\u2019t the end of your career, and you don\u2019t need to hide in the bathroom for the rest of the day.\u201d\n\nAnd truly, you should want feedback to be a regular, normal thing, because regular feedback leads to better work outcomes. Feedback shouldn\u2019t be rare, or reserved for a Big Deal Meeting with a box of tissues carefully placed on the table between you.\n\n6. Put the feedback in context.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to go into the conversation thinking you\u2019re making a minor correction and have the other person leave thinking their whole project was a disaster. Conversely, you don\u2019t want them to leave thinking something is minor if in fact it\u2019s quite serious. So make sure that you put the feedback in context. If it\u2019s minor, say it\u2019s minor, and explain that the rest of the work was good. If it\u2019s a big deal, don\u2019t berate them or be a jerk, but make sure that your words convey the significance of the problem.\n\n7. Be clear about what should change.\n\nIt might sound obvious, but sometimes people explain that something was wrong or needs to be done \u201cbetter\u201d without explaining what \u201cbetter\u201d means. It\u2019s easy to assume that the other person has the same mental frame of reference that you do \u2014 which can lead to using shorthand like \u201cthis draft needs to be more polished\u201d or \u201cmake this more punchy.\u201d It might be totally clear to you what you mean by that, but the person you\u2019re talking to might have a different idea of what you mean (or no idea). So spell out what you\u2019re looking for. For example, instead of \u201cmore polished,\u201d you might say, \u201cWhen you send me a draft, can you make sure it\u2019s fact-checked, proofread, formatted correctly, and ready to send out?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also smart to check to make sure the other person understands the feedback the way you intend. Especially if something is fairly complex, it can help to end the conversation with something like, \u201cTo make sure we\u2019re both on the same page, do you want to run through your takeaways for the next draft so we can both make sure we covered everything?\u201d\n\n8. Be open to the other person\u2019s perspective.\n\nFeedback shouldn\u2019t be a monologue. It should be a discussion, and it\u2019s important to listen to the other person\u2019s perspective. They might tell you something that changes your mind, and you don\u2019t want to be so committed to your initial assessment that you don\u2019t hear it if they do.\n\nGet Ask a Boss delivered every week Email Terms & Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\nOrder Alison Green\u2019s book Ask a Manager: Clueless Colleagues, Lunch-Stealing Bosses, and the Rest of Your Life at Work here.
