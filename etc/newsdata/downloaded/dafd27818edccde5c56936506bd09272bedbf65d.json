Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nTrump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have offered no evidence for their assertions of corruption against former Vice President Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic Party nomination to run against Trump.\n\nQuestioned about whether he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate, Trump said: \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s appeal to China was particularly striking given that Washington and Beijing are locked in a bitter trade war which has damaged global economic growth. They are due to hold another round of talks in the United States next week.\n\nThe China remarks stiffened the resolve of Democrats in the House of Representatives to push ahead with a probe into whether Trump should be impeached following revelations by an anonymous whistleblower who said that Trump asked Ukraine in July to investigate the Bidens.\n\nHunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at a time when the United States and Europe were trying to woo Ukraine away from next-door-neighbour Russia.\n\nSome Republicans have criticized Biden for taking his son on the Air Force Two vice presidential plane in 2013 to China, where Hunter had business interests.\n\nAt a healthcare event in The Villages, Florida, Trump said Democrats had launched the impeachment probe because they cannot beat him at the ballot box in 2020.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they do the impeachment crap - they know they can\u2019t win,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhile the election is still a long way off, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump narrowly trailing the top Democratic candidates, including Biden, in hypothetical matchups.\n\nIMPEACHMENT PROBE\n\nThe impeachment probe could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the Democratic-controlled House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate. Many Republicans, however, have shown little appetite for ousting him.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy wrote to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday asking that all efforts surrounding the impeachment inquiry be suspended until \u201ccustomary rules and procedures are established.\u201d\n\nHe asked whether she planned to hold a vote of the full House authorizing the inquiry, and whether the president\u2019s counsel would be allowed to attend all hearings and depositions. Refusing to do these things would contradict previous impeachment procedures, McCarthy said.\n\nPelosi announced the impeachment investigation last week after the whistleblower lodged a complaint about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into investigating the Bidens.\n\nTrump froze $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine shortly before speaking to Zelenskiy, prompting accusations from Democrats that he had misused U.S. foreign policy for personal gain.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump ordered the removal in May of the then-ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, after months of complaints from allies that she was undermining him abroad and obstructing efforts to persuade Kiev to investigate Biden.\n\nAsked if he was influential in the removal of the ambassador, Giuliani said: \u201cI just turn my information over\u201d to the State Department.\n\nThe Ukraine investigation has angered Trump, whose volatile presidency survived a two-year federal probe that found Russia had intervened to help him win the White House in 2016.\n\nIn an apparent warning to Trump, Ellen Weintraub, head of the watchdog Federal Election Commission, on Thursday retweeted a post she first sent in June about receiving foreign help in elections.\n\n\u201cLet me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. This is not a novel concept,\u201d her post read.\n\nVice President Mike Pence backed an investigation into Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cMy predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a Ukrainian board at the time that Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration\u2019s efforts in Ukraine, I think is worth looking into. And the president has made it very clear that he believes ... other nations around the world should look into it as well,\u201d Pence told reporters in Arizona.\n\nBiden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement that Trump\u2019s comments on Thursday showed he was \u201cdesperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked.\u201d\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s chairman, Democrat Adam Schiff, accused Trump of \u201ca fundamental breach of a president\u2019s oath of office\u201d because of his China comment.\n\nA longtime U.S. diplomat who served as Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine spoke to congressional committee members and staff on Thursday as part of the Democratic-led impeachment probe.\n\nKurt Volker resigned as special representative for Ukraine negotiations on Friday, the day after the public release of the whistleblower complaint that described him as trying to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d from efforts by Trump\u2019s lawyer Giuliani to press Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\nFILE PHOTO - Kurt Volker, United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Kiev, Ukraine October 28, 2017. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Picture\n\nGiuliani told Reuters on Thursday that Volker never expressed any concerns about his efforts and put him in touch with Andriy Yermak, an adviser to Zelenskiy.\n\n\u201cThere are texts where he asked me to report back to him on Yermak,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThere are texts that show that I did. There\u2019s never a text anywhere that says he\u2019s concerned about anything. And he never said that to me.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump on Thursday again invited foreign interference in a U.S. presidential election by publicly calling on China to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, the kind of request that has already triggered an impeachment inquiry in Congress.", "authors": ["Roberta Rampton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436680240&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9211L"}
