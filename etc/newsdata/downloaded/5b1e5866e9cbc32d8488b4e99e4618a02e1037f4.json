GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares slip before Fed decision on trade deal worries\n\n* MSCI world index stays near 21-month high\n\n* Investors expect Fed to cut rates, focus on policy outlook\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Asian share markets slipped on\n\nWednesday, as the prospect of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve\n\nwas countered by worries a Sino-U.S. first-stage trade deal\n\ncould be delayed.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nshed 0.33% from Tuesday's three-month high while\n\nJapan's Nikkei lost 0.35% after hitting a one-year high\n\nthe previous day.\n\nOn Wall Street overnight, the S&P 500 index touched a record\n\nintraday high, led by strong earnings from drug manufacturers\n\nsuch as Merck MRK.N and Pfizer PFE.N , before ending down\n\n0.08%.\n\nMarkets had erased gains after Reuters reported a U.S.\n\nadministration official said an interim trade agreement between\n\nWashington and Beijing might not be completed in time for\n\nsigning in Chile next month as expected. A disappointing profit report from Google parent Alphabet\n\nkept the technology-rich Nasdaq in the red, with the\n\nNasdaq Composite falling 0.59%.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe\n\nslipped 0.06% in Asia on Wednesday from a 21-month high reached\n\non Tuesday.\n\nSince U.S. President Donald Trump outlined what he called\n\nthe first phase of a trade deal with China earlier this month,\n\ninvestors have bet on a trade truce between the two countries,\n\ndriving global equities higher.\n\nExpectations of further U.S. monetary policy loosening also\n\nemboldened investors, with a reduction of 0.25 percentage point\n\nlater in the day almost seen as a done deal.\n\n\"With a cut today completely priced in, markets are looking\n\nto the Fed's stance on its policy outlook,\" said Masahiro\n\nIchikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset\n\nManagement.\n\nWhile Fed funds rate futures 0#FF: fully price in a 25-\n\nbasis-point cut on Wednesday, only about a 30% chance of another\n\ncut in December has been priced in, compared with about 70%\n\nearlier this month.\n\n\"I think the Fed will clearly indicate that a rate cut in\n\nDecember is not its main scenario,\" said Tomoaki Shishido, macro\n\nstrategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nFading expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the Fed have\n\nlifted the two-year U.S. bond yield to 1.644% ,\n\ncompared with a two-year low of 1.368% in early October.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 1.833%\n\n, near a 1-1/2-month high of 1.860% touched earlier\n\nthis week.\n\nThat has helped to lift the dollar against the yen. The\n\ndollar was traded at 108.86 yen , after having hit a\n\nthree-month high of 109.07 yen\n\nThe euro stood at $1.1107 , having bounced off from\n\nTuesday's low of $1.10735.\n\nSterling wobbled after Britain decided to hold an election\n\non Dec. 12 following Prime Minister Boris Johnson winning\n\napproval from parliament for an early ballot aimed at breaking\n\nthe Brexit deadlock. While Johnson seeks to gain a parliamentary majority to\n\nratify his Brexit deal, the election would be highly\n\nunpredictable as Brexit has fatigued and enraged swathes of\n\nvoters, while eroding traditional loyalties to the two major\n\nparties, Conservative and Labour.\n\nThe currency last traded at $1.2861 GBP=D4 .\n\nOil prices slipped after an industry report that stocks at\n\nthe Cushing delivery hub for the benchmark rose last week,\n\nshrugging off a drop in overall inventories.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.47%\n\nto $55.28 per barrel while international benchmark Brent crude\n\nfutures dropped 0.19% to $61.47 a barrel.\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Richard Borsuk)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares slip before Fed decision on trade deal worries", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA7D094_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
