I laid a hand affectionately across her shoulder,' she wrote.\n\n'I daresay that the Queen was okay with it, too, because when I touched her, she only pulled closer, resting a gloved hand lightly on the small of my back.'\n\nAt the time, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson insisted it was not a breach.\n\n'It was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection. We don\u2019t issue instructions on not touching the queen,' the spokesperson said.\n\nMs. Kelly, who is both the Queen's dressmaker and confidante, also revealed in her new book that she personally wears in the monarch's shoes before engagements to make sure they are comfortable.\n\nWearing them in: Ms. Kelly, also revealed in her new book that she personally wears in the monarch's shoes before engagements to make sure they are comfortable\n\nThe Queen sits with Anna Wintour (third right) and Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council (BFC) (left) and royal dressmaker Angela Kelly (second right)\n\nShe explained that she shares the same shoe size as the Queen, and given the monarch has little time to herself, she wears in the shoes for her.\n\nAuthor: Angela Kelly, the royal dressmaker, talks about her experiences in her new book, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe\n\n'It makes the most sense this way,' she said. 'As has been reported a lot in the press, a flunky wears in Her Majesty\u2019s shoes to ensure that they are comfortable and that she is always good to go. And yes, I am that flunky.'\n\nMs. Kelly also shared anecdotes about the Queen\u2019s part in a James Bond sketch at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nShe recalled being presented with the plan by film director Danny Boyle through the Queen\u2019s private secretary Edward Young.\n\n'There are few occasions on which Her Majesty will agree to break protocol, but in 2011 when film director Danny Boyle approached the Royal Household, he had a request to make that we simply could not refuse,' she said.\n\n'She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: \"Of course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me.\"'\n\nWhat fun! The Queen was 'amused' when asked to appear in a James Bond sketch for the 2012 London Olympics and quickly agreed\n\nHer work: Pictured are the three dresses worn by the Queen during her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, designed and created by Angela Kelly MVO\n\nMs. Kelly said she asked the Queen if she would like to say: 'Good evening, James' or 'Good evening, Mr. Bond. The monarch chose the latter.\n\n'Within minutes, I was back in Edward\u2019s office delivering the good news to Danny \u2014 I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen\u2019s only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line: \"Good evening, Mr. Bond,\"' she said.\n\nThe book also reveals how Yorkshire tea helped to recreate a replica of the royal christening gown, which was first used for the christening of James, Viscount Severn, in 2008.\n\n'To make sure it looked authentic we dyed it in Yorkshire tea (the strongest, as we all know),' Ms. Kelly said.\n\n'We placed each piece of lace in a small bowl, from the Dressers\u2019 kitchen, filled with cool water and a tea bag and left it for about five minutes, checking regularly until the colour was perfect.'", "description": "The Queen's dressmaker\u00a0Angela Kelly recalled the moment in her new book, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20284736-0-image-a-32_1572275795936.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
