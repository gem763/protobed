Mike Clevinger, who has won his past 10 decisions, will start Saturday\u2019s opener for Cleveland.\n\nZACK ATTACK\n\nZack Greinke is 5-1 with a 3.32 ERA in seven starts for Houston since the Astros acquired him from Arizona. Greinke is 15-5 with a 2.99 ERA overall going into Saturday\u2019s start against Kansas City and Mike Montgomery (3-8).\n\nREVERSAL OF FORTUNE?\n\nNL Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom of the Mets is 0-4 with a 3.23 ERA in nine starts against the Dodgers going into Saturday\u2019s outing against Los Angeles. The Dodgers\u2019 Hyun-Jin Ryu is 4-1 with a 1.38 ERA in seven starts against New York.\n\nBACK IN TIME\n\nTyler Glasnow (6-1, 2.15 ERA) will continue his attempt to pitch his way back into form before the postseason when the Tampa Bay right-hander makes his second start since missing four months with a right forearm strain. The Los Angeles-area native faces the Angels in Anaheim. Glasnow went just two innings in his first start last weekend, but reported no ill effects from those 41 pitches. The Rays got more good news for their playoff chase when AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell was tentatively slated to start Tuesday at Dodger Stadium. Snell has been out since July with an elbow problem that required surgery. Having Snell in the rotation seems vital to the Rays\u2019 hopes.\n\nRETURNING ARMS\n\nNew York Yankees right-hander Luis Severino, who hasn\u2019t pitched this season because of a lat injury, is expected to make his debut Tuesday against the Los Angeles Angels. Severino made three minor league injury rehabilitation appearances. Left-hander Jordan Montgomery will return from Tommy John surgery to face Toronto on Sunday, possibly following an opener. Montgomery hasn\u2019t pitched in the major leagues since May 1, 2018.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Saturday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/twins_indians_baseball_53225_c61-0-3386-1939_s1770x1032.jpg?b6abf94d592dc45ee500697e0d270eda8e8fc292", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
