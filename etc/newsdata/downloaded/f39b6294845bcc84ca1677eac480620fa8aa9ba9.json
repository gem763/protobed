I almost couldn\u2019t speak to respond. It was that painfully true.\u201d\n\nActor Mark Hamill chimed in, calling the cartoon \u201cPulitzer Prize\u2013worthy.\u201d\n\nWhile it was clearly a viral hit, the cartoon didn\u2019t go over too well with the people signing the checks, according to de Adder:\n\nThe highs and lows of cartooning. Today I was just let go from all newspapers in New Brunswick. #editorialcartooning #nbpoli #editorialcartooning \u2014 Michael de Adder (@deAdder) June 28, 2019\n\nWes Tyrell, president of the Association of Canadian Cartoonists, claimed in a Facebook FB, +0.35% post that there\u2019s more going on here with the J.D. Irving\u2013owned Brunswick News Inc. than just a controversial cartoon.\n\n\u201cThe Irvings have considerable corporate interests in the United States, but why would they care about cartoons potentially offending the American president?\u201d Tyrell wrote. \u201cTrade has been an issue since Trump took office, trade that affects the Irvings directly, not to mention a host of other issues. And the President himself is an unknown quantity who punishes those who appear to oppose him.\u201d\n\nThe Brunswick News admitted terminating de Adder\u2019s contract but denied the cartoon was the cause.\n\n\u201cThis is a false narrative which has emerged carelessly and recklessly on social media,\u201d BNI said in a statement Sunday. \u201cIn fact, BNI was not even offered this cartoon by Mr. de Adder. The decision to bring back reader favourite Greg Perry was made long before this cartoon, and negotiations had been ongoing for weeks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, de Adder is still at it:", "description": "This cartoon apparently wasn\u2019t fit to print, and it reportedly cost Michael de Adder his job after the internet got hold of it.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM490_golf_ZG_20190630150111.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-30"}
