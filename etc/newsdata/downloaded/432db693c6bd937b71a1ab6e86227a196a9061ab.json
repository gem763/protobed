Is he nothing but an arrogant, unpleasant liability who\u2019ll throw anyone under a bus to save owning up to his mistakes? Or is there more to him than that?\n\nThis episode started to give us some answers, and I\u2019m now firmly in the \u2018more to him than that\u2019 camp \u2013 and I really love how the writers and Victor Oshin have created such a complex personality. Having seen glimpses of his home life in this episode, it seems that what\u2019s probably going on is that he\u2019s the son that the whole family have pinned their hopes on \u2013 and he just can\u2019t let them down. He has to live up to their expectations \u2013 and his own expectations too.\n\nAt times you can see the caring, lovely doctor he could be \u2013 when he talked to Carina about her pregnancy he was so kind and sensitive (until he spoiled it by getting her to fill in a feedback form). His family clearly adore him, so I\u2019m willing to bet that this is who he really is and the side of him that sneers at Jade as a \u2018newly qualified nurse\u2019 and rejects advice is just a front.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen these types before on Casualty, but Mason\u2019s \u2018front\u2019 runs a lot deeper than most. Normally a couple of episodes in and arrogant junior doctors are starting to relax and become team players. Not so with Mason, and he\u2019s fascinating to watch \u2013 even if he is a nightmare to work with.\n\nStress in \u2018The Hide\u2019 (Picture: BBC)\n\nMeanwhile, Rosa (Jacey Salles) has her work cut out living with David (Jason Durr) and Ollie (Harry Collett). The pair of them are very much alike. When Ollie\u2019s mum said she wanted Ollie to come back to live with her both Ollie and David didn\u2019t really want that, but they were both going to go along with it anyway. It took Rosa to once again remind David that he has to assert himself if he\u2019s going to be the father that Ollie needs.\n\nAnd there were signs that Ethan (George Rainsford) and Effie (Abigail Hardingham) are falling for each other. She came to seek his advice about whether she should take part in the CF trial after all. She\u2019s scared she\u2019ll react badly to the treatment and it\u2019ll leave her worse than she was before. Ethan didn\u2019t want to influence her, but when she was brought in with breathing problems that turned out to be a panic attack he told her he thought she should go on the trial, and held her hand. The way they looked at each other spoke volumes. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t end in tears. And let\u2019s hope Mason isn\u2019t allowed anywhere near the CF trial.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
