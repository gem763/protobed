Courtesy Crazy House\n\nIn February 1990, she drew up plans for Crazy House. But instead of blueprints, she created a series of paintings to communicate her fantastical vision.\n\nAs a form of expressionist architecture, the house has no right angles but rather organic forms that are designed to mirror natural elements, like mushrooms, shells, caves and spiderwebs.\n\nDang Viet Nga, artist \u201cCrazy House will never really be finished. It's like a living thing. It is always changing.\u201d\n\n\"With this form, you have to try to free your mind,\" she says. \"There are no rules -- aside from basic structural principles [to make sure it's safe and stable] -- it's all about self-expression.\"\n\nWhen it came time to construct the house, Dang used various types of materials, including steel, wood and concrete.\n\n\"My mother used a lot of concrete because it's inexpensive and very easy to play with,\" says her son Nguyen, who is now 44.\n\nRelated content Lonely Planet's best places to visit in Asia Pacific for 2019\n\n\"Since she can create whatever shape she wants, it reflects what she is envisioning in her mind.\"\n\nLess than a year later, the guesthouse was open for business and welcoming its first guests.\n\nCloser to nature\n\nToday, Crazy House feels like woodland fantasy brought to life.\n\n\"I felt that, over the last century, people have really destroyed nature. Not just in Vietnam, but around the world,\" says Dang. \"So I wanted to create a structure that brings people closer to nature.\"\n\nAn elevated main house, which looks like it belongs in Hansel and Gretel, sits in the center of an open courtyard, surrounded by four enormous tree houses.\n\nThe Crazy House has been welcoming guests since 1991.

Don't limit yourself by the rules and the expectations -- free your mind and let your imagination run wild.\"\n\nFollowing her own advice, Dang is continues to dream up new additions to the property while Nguyen now manages the business.\n\nShe is currently dreaming up two new gardens -- a Land Garden and a Sky Garden -- to add more greenery and flowers, as well as another tree house.\n\n\"I would say that Crazy House will never really be finished,\" says Nguyen. \"It's like a living thing. It is always changing.\"\n\nHow to visit\n\nIn addition to staying in one of Crazy House's guest rooms, visitors can also tour the Dalat attraction for a fee. Though there's no restaurant, visitors can purchase drinks and snacks at a stall in the garden.", "description": "Wild, weird, wonderful -- there are many ways to describe the Crazy House (also known as Hang Nga Guesthouse).
