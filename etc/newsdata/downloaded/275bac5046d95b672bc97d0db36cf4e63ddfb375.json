So when a strange man contacted her in the Polk County Jail and the two struck up a conversation, authorities say, it didn\u2019t take long before the inmate revealed what she really wanted: her husband dead.\n\n\u201cCan it be like an accident like a robbery gone wrong or something that cannot come back to me like it was a plan,\u201d Lopez wrote in the undated letter, according to the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cYou are my angel.\u201d\n\nTo say the scheme backfired would be an understatement. Lopez was actually communicating with an undercover cop, and she now faces additional charges for solicitation to commit murder, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at a Wednesday news conference. The not-so-covert plot, which police say involved euphemistic talk of \u201cremoving a tree,\u201d was all captured in emails and recorded phone calls likely to further complicate Lopez\u2019s divorce and ongoing legal woes.\n\nOver the past two years, Lopez has fallen victim to no less than three separate sting operations. The first took place in June 2018, when she was arrested for practicing medicine without a license at an Auburndale, Fla., weight loss clinic named \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d Though she has never been licensed as a registered nurse in the state, Lopez, who described herself as the clinic\u2019s owner on Facebook, posed for photographs in medical scrubs next to framed certificates that referred to her as \u201cJesse Lopez, R.N.,\" authorities said at the time.\n\nThe clinic advertised heavily on social media, posting photos and videos that showed Lopez, who only had an expired pharmacy technician license, removing patients\u2019 moles and using lasers to perform facials, the Miami Herald reported. When undercover officers dropped by, Lopez allegedly told them that she could give them a \u201cvampire facelift,\u201d a procedure made famous by Kim Kardashian that involves injecting a patient\u2019s own blood and plasma into their face. Several patients told investigators that they had been under the impression that Lopez was a doctor, and that she had prescribed them weight loss drugs.\n\nAfter reaching a plea deal with prosecutors in January, Lopez was granted probation with one major condition: She wasn\u2019t allowed to possess needles or advertise herself as a nurse.\n\nBut in February, less than a year after her first arrest, the Florida Department of Health got a tip that Lopez had set up shop again, opening what she called \u201cJesse\u2019s Gym.\u201d The so-called gym, which also used the tagline \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d actually held six medical exam rooms, Judd said in February. When undercover investigators showed up, posing as potential clients, Lopez allegedly offered them human chorionic gonadotropin, a prescription hormone, as well as meal-replacement powders and syringes.\n\nThis time, Lopez was jailed without bail. In August, the sheriff\u2019s office got word that she had been openly telling people in jail that she wanted her husband killed. The two had become estranged \u2014 a February news release about Lopez\u2019s arrest referred to a different man as her fiance \u2014 and were locked in a dispute, Judd said. She had also become convinced that her husband would be a crucial witness for the pending criminal trial, even though the undercover detectives had plenty of evidence of their own.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s thinking, \u2018If my husband were out of the way, that would take care of my witness and my child custody issues,\u2019\u201d the sheriff theorized at Wednesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cSo she starts talking around in the community about how she wants him murdered.\u201d\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office had yet another undercover deputy get in touch with Lopez. Despite her past experiences, she apparently wasn\u2019t suspicious of the man\u2019s motivations, opening up to him in recorded phone calls where she complained about the bad food and faulty air-conditioning in jail. She blamed her legal problems on her husband, claiming that he hadn\u2019t worked in over 10 years.\n\n\u201cHere I am, because of greed,\u201d Lopez said in one recording released by the sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cEverything is paid off. And he put me here.\u201d\n\nThe two also communicated through the jail\u2019s email system, using yard work as a cover for discussing murder, Judd said. Lopez told the undercover detective that she had a tree in her yard that she wanted removed, and offered to pay $2,000 to get the job done. When the undercover detective wrote back, asking for a photo of the tree, Lopez allegedly replied with a picture of her husband.\n\nIn the handwritten letter that she sent from jail, Lopez promised that she would have the \u201cbread,\u201d a common slang term for money. She told the deputy when she expected her husband to be at work, and described his car. \u201cIf it can be done asap that would be great,\u201d she allegedly wrote. \u201cHe is the reason why I\u2019m in here he is the main key witness.\u201d\n\nShe signed off: \u201cBurn this letter xoxo.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, deputies went to the Polk County Jail and told Lopez the truth: The friendly hit man she had tried to hire was actually an undercover officer. Judd said that the 40-year-old began laughing, and admitted to sending the letter and placing the phone calls.\n\n\u201cIn the Polk County vernacular, this lady\u2019s a nut, but she\u2019s dangerous,\u201d the sheriff said.\n\nIn addition to the new charge of solicitation to commit first-degree murder, Lopez is also still awaiting trial on charges including selling drugs without a prescription, practicing medicine without a license, and a probation violation from her February arrest. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if she had an attorney.\n\nThe status of Lopez\u2019s divorce is also unclear, but Judd said that her estranged husband, Daniel Lopez, had been notified that his wife was plotting to kill him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he was surprised, because she does some really strange things,\u201d he said.", "description": "Faced with felony charges for operating an unsanctioned weight loss clinic in central Florida, Jesusadelaida \u201cJesse\u201d Lopez worried that her husband would be a key witness, officials say.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "October At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
