That's deliberate, part of the appeal.\n\n\"Any kind of old building is a kind of eruption of the past into the present,\" he says.\n\nAbandoned mansion house, Fanling, New Territories East, Hong Kong: There's a sense of faded glamor in this abanadoned Hong Kong house.

He's captivated, he says, by what he refers to as the \"poetry\" of abandoned palaces.\n\nHavr\u00e9 Castle, Mons, Hainault, Belgium: A 17th century Belgium house that's been unoccupied since the early 20th century.

Kerrigan points to great works of literature that delve into the topic of ruin and passage of time.\n\n\"People have always found something marvelous about these great achievements of the past and and how time has taken its toll,\" says the author.\n\nPidhirtsi Palace, Pidhirtsi, Lviv, Ukraine: Built in the 1630s as the home of a Polish military commander and royal counsellor.

The narrator wanders the English city of Bath, witnessing the former, forgotten glory of the Roman ruins dotted across the city.\n\n\"I don't know how far this was just a poetic voice, but quite possibly, he was being almost literal,\" suggest Kerrigan. \"He describes these old aqueducts and things as the work of giants because, it's these things -- that civilization, that people -- that now seem very mysterious -- past glories.\"\n\nOnslaught of time\n\nSaddam Hussein's Palace, Hilla, Babil Governorate, Iraq: Saddam Hussein built this palace as an homage to Babylon.
