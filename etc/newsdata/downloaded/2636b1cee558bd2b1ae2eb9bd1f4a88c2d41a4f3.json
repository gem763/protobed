If ignored, its ripple effect will spread in the\n\nsub-region given the country's important role in the continent,\"\n\nshe said.\n\nSpokesman for the ministries of justice, military and police\n\ndid not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Callamard's\n\nfindings.\n\nThe Islamist insurgency waged by Boko Haram began in\n\nnortheast Nigeria in 2009 but has spread to parts of\n\nneighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger where members of the group\n\nand militants allied to Islamic State carry out attacks.\n\nThe rapporteur also condemned what she said was the\n\n\"arbitrary deprivation of life\" and the excessive use of lethal\n\nforce in the case of processions held by banned Shi'ite Muslim\n\ngroup the Islamic Movement in Nigeria.\n\nCallamard said the move to ban the group appeared be based\n\non what the authorities thought IMN could become rather than its\n\nactions. She said she had not been presented with any evidence\n\nto suggest the group was weaponised and posed a threat to the\n\ncountry.", "description": "Nigerian insecurity requires urgent attention, U.N. rapporteur warns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg"}
