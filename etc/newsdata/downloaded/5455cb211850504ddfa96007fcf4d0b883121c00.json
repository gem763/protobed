He has been suspended for two and a half years.\n\n'You would think Sussex Police would have prepared his gross misconduct hearing by now.'\n\nShe told MailOnline she had completely lost trust and confidence in the justice system as a result of the protracted affair and Sussex Police's handling of the matter.\n\nA spokeswoman for Sussex Police said: 'Anthony Lumb, a police inspector based at Brighton, is being investigated for misconduct in public office and will face a gross misconduct hearing at a date to be fixed.\n\n'Inspector Lumb was suspended at the point of allegations in 2017 and the case referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) for full investigation.\n\n'In 2018, the IOPC subsequently directed Sussex Police to progress a gross misconduct hearing following a review by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\n'The CPS concluded, following appeal, there was no criminal case to answer in July of this year. Sussex Police is now in the process of preparing the hearing, scheduled for five days, which as required will be led by a legally-qualified chair.\n\n'Inspector Lumb is suspended on full pay, as is mandated by national police regulations.'", "description": "Sussex Police Inspector Tony Lumb, 52, was arrested in March of 2017.
