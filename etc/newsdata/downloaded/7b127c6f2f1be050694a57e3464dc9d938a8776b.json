Those who run afoul of Syrian Kurdish guards are being taken to already-overcrowded refugee camps. According to an aid worker at the Domiz camp, every new arrival since the beginning of the Turkish invasion was someone who \u201ccame by smuggling.\u201d\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said it has documented over a thousand refugees crossing into Iraqi Kurdistan so far. Most of them ended up in yet another camp, this one called Baradash. It was originally constructed to house refugees from the capital of the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Iraq, Mosul, but was closed years ago and hastily reopened to handle those fleeing the Turkish invasion.\n\n\u201cIf I go back Syria will kill me, Turkey will kill me. And Trump left us,\u201d a Syrian Kurdish refugee named Mustafa told Rudaw.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust Europe, America, France. I don\u2019t believe anyone. Democracy is for money. It\u2019s a business; not for peace,\u201d he added.\n\nNBC News on Thursday reported \u201ca sense of outrage at the American troops they say abandoned them\u201d from the Baradash refugee camp, while also confirming that the major obstacle facing those who wish to flee Syria is Kurdish military units. According to NBC News:\n\n\u201cAmerica has betrayed the Kurds,\u201d said Rania, 20, from Qamishli, a city along the Turkish border that took heavy Turkish artillery shelling during the early days of the incursion last week. \u201cWe worked hand in hand, but no longer. Now there is no future for Syria.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cAmerica has left us and all these things happened,\u201d said Omar Boby Ossy, an elderly man who traveled for four days with his family from the northern Syrian city of Ras al Ain. Ossy said he spent several days on the border negotiating his crossing with smugglers. Border officials from the Syrian Democratic Forces, made up primarily of Kurdish fighters, have not allowed civilian refugees to cross without the proper paperwork so most make the journey illegally. \u201cWhen we arrived at the border with Kurdistan we were allowed to cross,\u201d Ossy said. \u201cWe paid money. Five hundred dollars, four hundred dollars for each person.\u201d The alternative, he said, was to face \u201ctanks, missiles, mortars, jets flying above\u201d in his hometown \u2014 a Kurdish city that had remained remarkably peaceful throughout Syria\u2019s eight-year civil war until just this week.\n\nAccording to NBC, another 622 refugees arrived at Baradash on Thursday. The Baradash camp was originally built to hold 50,000 refugees. Aid workers say many of the buildings will need repairs to accommodate more than the 1,500 or so who have arrived so far.", "description": "Over a thousand Syrian Kurdish refugees have fled the Turkish invasion with the aid of smugglers and sought refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176343135-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
