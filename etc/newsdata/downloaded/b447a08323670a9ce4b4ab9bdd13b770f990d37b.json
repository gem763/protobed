It's a great laptop, but the aging processor makes it a poor buy compared to the MacBook Air.\n\nHardware last updated: June 2017.\n\nAvoid: iPad\n\nWhy you should avoid: The current iPad was updated a year ago, and the line didn't see a refresh along with the iPad Air and iPad mini, which means that it might be a good idea to either pick up one of the updated models, or wait for a hardware refresh to come. After all, a year is a long time in technology.\n\nHardware last updated: March 2018.\n\nAvoid: HomePod\n\nWhy you should avoid: The current HomePod is a first-generation device that was released over a year ago to offer a challenge to devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home speaker. But a year old in the tech industry is a long time, and so it might be worthwhile holding out on buying one until we get a clearer idea of whether Apple is planning a refresh.\n\nHardware last updated: February 2018.\n\nAvoid: Mac Pro\n\nWhy you should avoid: Old, outdated, and Apple has already teased us with a replacement due in 2019.\n\nOnce the apex of Apple's computer line, the Mac Pro is now a dinosaur.\n\nNow that Apple has unveiled the new Mac Pro, and slated it for release later this year, the old Mac Pro should be off everyone's list (unless you absolutely rely on it and you have to replace one that's been taken out of action).\n\nHardware last updated: Price cut April 2017, but the Mac Pro has been unchanged since December 2013.\n\nAvoid: Apple TV 4K\n\nGuidance: Probably not going to see a refresh this year, so it's worth it if you feel like paying top dollar for last year's tech.\n\nApple's 5th-generation Apple TV 4K, built around the A10X Fusion processor and coming with a choice of 32GB or 64GB of storage, was last updated over a year ago. It's still a great device, but the starting price of $179 feels hefty for something over a year old.\n\nDon't be confused between this and the 4th-generation Apple TV (without the 4K branding) which is also still for sale. This was first released October 2015.\n\nHardware last updated: The 5th-generation Apple TV 4K was launched September 2017.\n\nAvoid: Apple Lightning cable\n\nWhy you should avoid: Buy something cheaper that will last you longer!\n\nI would never buy another Lightning cable from Apple, as there are far better alternatives on offer from companies such as Anker, Amazon, Nomad, and Paracable.\n\nBut what about USB-C-to-Lightning I hear you ask? Well, for the first time you have an option outside of Apple now that Anker has released its own Powerline II USB-C-to-Lightning cable, which is fully compliant with Apple's Made For iPhone (MFi) standard.\n\nStatus: Too expensive!\n\nBe aware: iMac Pro\n\n18 months is a long time in tech, and a Windows-based PC that was this old would not be worth paying a premium price for. However, this is an Apple computer, and things are different there.\n\nHowever, the iMac Pro is a premium system and 18 months is quite a long time, so be aware if you are dropping a few thousand dollars on a system like this that you are not getting the newest, freshest components possible.\n\nHardware last updated: December 2017.\n\nBe aware: Apple Watch Series 4\n\nApple tends to update the Apple Watch every 18 months or so, so it's well worth being aware of the fact that the current iteration is rolling around to the year mark. If you are upgrading then you might be better off waiting for an updated model to land.\n\nHardware last updated: September 2018.", "description": "Here's a tour of what's not so fresh in the Apple Store.", "authors": ["Adrian Kingsley-Hughes"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/09/e1648e18-4d52-4f8e-a4f2-99a848c611a1/thumbnail/770x578/59e7ec928f16d8e5aaadbddcb744df86/apple-card-iphone-xs-max.jpg"}
