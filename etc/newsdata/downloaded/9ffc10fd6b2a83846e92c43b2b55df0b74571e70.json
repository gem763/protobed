The gold miner told the market its production was down almost 40,000 ounces compared with the previous three months and, on top of that, sales had slowed as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the update, shares in the company fell 8 per cent to $10.25. However, the 0.2 per cent downturn in gold prices to $US1487.84 an ounce could have contributed to Northern Star's muted session as well.\n\nOther resource stocks on the wane included BHP Group and Rio Tinto.\n\nBHP said the production of petroleum, copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, energy coal, and nickel were all down on the previous period. The big miner's shares fell 3.3 per cent to $34.86 a share.\n\nRio, which released its production update on Wednesday, bore mixed analyst reactions to its report and skidded 2.9 per cent to $87.22.\n\n\"Output of bauxite, alumina and aluminium was all weaker than we had expected due to weather, maintenance and operational issues,\" said Macquarie Wealth Management, which revised its target price on Rio lower to $105.\n\nUBS analysts, meantime, acknowledged Rio's quarter was improved, but still saw \"some niggles\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand was South32, which boosted its share price by 1.6 per cent to $2.50 with double-digit increases in manganese and zinc production. Woodside Petroleum was also on the up on Thursday, with a 0.7 per cent lift to $32.12.\n\nGains were also seen in IOOF Holdings after the financial adviser secured a lower price for its purchase of Australia and New Zealand Bank's wealth pension and investment business, which would now only cost $825 million instead of $950 million.\n\nThe development reflected well on IOOF shares, which rose 10.9 per cent to $7.05. Yet the positive feelings did not follow through to ANZ as it dropped 0.8 per cent to $27.95.\n\nFellow major banks Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, and National Australia Bank were also in the red. CBA was down 0.4 per cent to $80.11, Westpac fell 0.6 per cent to $29.08, and NAB slid 0.1 to $28.86\n\nBuy-now-pay-later juggernaut Afterpay entered its second straight day of declines with a 5.7 per cent retreat to $31.98.
