But that did not stop him from giving his players a half-time roasting which inspired a comeback.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the first half, Mihajlovic called the coaching staff who told us how angry he was about the score and this shook us up,\u201d said forward Rodrigo Palacio, whose side hit back from 3-1 down to win 4-3.\n\n\u201cWe really miss having him on the bench with us.\u201d\n\nThe team bus stopped by Mihajlovic\u2019s hospital on its way back to Bologna and the players celebrated outside his window.\n\nSARRI\u2019S EXCUSES MAY NOT CONVINCE AT JUVE\n\nJuventus coach Maurizio Sarri rolled out the excuses after the Serie A champions were held to a 0-0 draw at Fiorentina.\n\nSarri, who missed Juve\u2019s opening two games with pneumonia, blamed the three o\u2019clock kick off time in Florence and a spate of injuries for the Turin side\u2019s poor performance. Douglas Costa went off after seven minutes, Miralem Pjanic before halftime and Danilo in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt was a very complicated situation because we had to use up all our substitutions when three changes with fresh players at key moments would have been important,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo play at three o\u2019clock is different to 20.45 because it was 35 degrees in the middle of the pitch ... We had five players at the Copa America and eight in the treatment room (for summer) so some are ahead of others in their preparation.\u201d\n\nCONTE CANNOT RESIST A QUICK JIBE\n\nIn a previous stint at Napoli, Sarri complained, among other things, about having to play at midday and also that his team always seemed to play their matches after Juventus which he said put them at a psychological disadvantage.\n\nInter Milan coach Antonio Conte was among those who pointed out that Sarri\u2019s complaints may well be looked on in a different light at Juventus.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say anything because otherwise I would have to bring out the budgets, the turnover and the balance sheets,\u201d he said after his side\u2019s 1-0 win over Udinese. \u201cNow, he is on the side of the strongest team so he needs to stay calm.\u201d\n\nVAR MALFUNCTIONS AT GENOA\n\nAtalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini said the referee apologised after awarding opponents Genoa a 90th minute penalty and blamed a malfunctioning VAR system for the decision.\n\nThe referee pointed to the spot after Kouame went down under a clumsy challenge, although there appeared to be minimal contact. Domenico Criscito equalised but there was a final twist as Duvan Zapata scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to give Atalanta a 2-1 win.\n\n\u201cThe referee said sorry because the VAR did not work for the penalty,\u201d said Gasperini \u201cThe replays showed there was no contact. An episode like that could have taken two points from us.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nROMA LOOKING PROMISING, SAME OLD MILAN\n\nAS Roma, 4-2 winners over Sassuolo, are nothing if not entertaining under new coach Paulo Fonseca: in three games, they have scored eight goals and conceded six.\n\nThe same cannot be said of AC Milan who scraped past 10-man Verona with a penalty: they have scored twice and conceded one goal in their three games.\n\nAlthough Sassuolo have only three points, forward Domenico Berardi is Serie A\u2019s top scorer with five goals.", "description": "Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri blamed injuries and heat for his team's 0-0 draw at Fiorentina - but was quickly warned that his habit of fishing for excuses is unlikely to win many friends now he is no longer with an underdog team.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430410739&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0NO", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
