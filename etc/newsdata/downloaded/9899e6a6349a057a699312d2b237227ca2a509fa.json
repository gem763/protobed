I can remember exactly where I was when we read it, looking out over the valley below. The email said that Prince had confirmed to headline Glastonbury. We walked the rest of the way in an ecstatic daze, as we\u2019d been trying to get him to play for as long as I could remember, but it had never looked as if it was going to happen. Until now!\n\nPrince\u2019s promoter in the UK had even told us in a very direct manner that Prince would never play our festival. But we never gave up on it, because we knew how incredible it would be. We just thought, if we can get Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder, then why not Prince? And finally we had him! The funny thing was that there was an incredible sunset that evening, and the sky was completely purple. It felt like a sign.\n\nBut only a few days later, we got a message saying Prince had changed his mind. One of the reasons was that, not for the first time, a newspaper had run a story saying that he was playing Glastonbury, which they used to do pretty much every year, along with the Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd rumours. His lawyers thought we\u2019d given the story to the press to promote ourselves, which we would never do. Nor was it in our interests: we\u2019d already sold all of that year\u2019s tickets. We deliberately don\u2019t announce acts before they go on sale. We want people to come because they want to be here to experience the festival for everything it has to offer, not because one particular act is playing. Music is fundamental to this festival, but there is so much going on here beyond that.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stormzy headlining at Glastonbury in 2019.

When we announced Stormzy was playing, there was a lot of outrage about him not being suitable or ready, but I think you would struggle to find anyone saying that after seeing his show. After all the drama and conflict there had been in the run-up to him headlining, there was nothing better than seeing him smash it on that Friday night and walk off the stage a superstar.\n\nHeadlining Glastonbury is a curveball for some of the more established artists, too. We have massive acts such as U2, Beyonc\u00e9 or the Rolling Stones, who don\u2019t usually play outside of their own huge shows. Suddenly they\u2019re playing as part of a festival bill that wasn\u2019t announced when the tickets were sold. It makes it quite nerve-racking for them. I\u2019ve heard acts talking about the jeopardy of a big Glastonbury set. They have to come out, pumped up like a prize fighter, and work extra hard to put on a great show and win over the crowd. I think that\u2019s a big part of what makes so many Glastonbury sets so memorable \u2013 they have a real edge.\n\nThe Jay-Z furore in 2008 probably took that to a new level, and it hasn\u2019t really stopped since. We had it all over again in 2015 with Kanye West. As soon as we announced that he was playing, a petition sprang up \u2013 started by someone who had never been to Glastonbury \u2013 saying Kanye shouldn\u2019t play because he wasn\u2019t right for us. The media jumped right on it. That kind of negative story will always get clicks and attention, but the coverage becomes self-fulfilling, too. Again, we had to reassure the people around the artist that it would all work, that these stories don\u2019t reflect the attitude of people coming to the festival \u2013 or in the UK, for that matter. It\u2019s just a load of hot air.\n\nThe criticism we got that year was pretty extreme. And a lot of it was quite personal, as people knew I booked the acts. I was an obvious target. As the child of the founder of something, you\u2019re always going to be criticised, because you\u2019re perceived as doing things differently to how it was done before. I\u2019ve had to try to develop a thick skin about it, as it can get pretty unpleasant on social media. You can\u2019t please everyone, and the haters tend to be the ones shouting the loudest. I actually had death threats in 2015, which seemed a little harsh \u2013 especially given that we had booked what we considered to be one of the most exciting and innovative artists of his generation. But it worked out for Kanye in the end.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kanye West headlining Glastonbury in 2015. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt was a lively night \u2013 he arrived in a whirlwind with the Kardashians, and he had plans to go up in a cherry picker crane during his set. But even five minutes before he was due to go on, he hadn\u2019t decided whether he would actually use it. It all felt very unpredictable and I had no idea what to expect. It was probably one of the most divisive gigs we\u2019ve had. Although it didn\u2019t fully connect with everyone, I loved that it was totally uncompromising and original and bold: it was unlike any other show we\u2019ve had here.\n\nHe did end up using the cherry picker. I\u2019m not sure how well that came across on TV, but in the field, with Kanye rapping from this huge crane above the crowd, it was awesome. If you\u2019ve ever been up in one of those things, you\u2019ll know that it\u2019s enough of a challenge just to stand there and hold on for dear life, let alone rap to 100,000 people. He\u2019s incredibly ballsy.\n\nKanye\u2019s set also led directly to Adele agreeing to headline the following year. I\u2019d been trying to persuade her, but I think she was unsure. She didn\u2019t really need to do it: she was already playing stadiums, and with her it almost seems like the less she does, the bigger she gets. But I think that deep down she wanted to, as she\u2019d been coming to Glastonbury since she was a little kid. I walked her on to the platform next to the stage just before Kanye came on, and we looked out at this huge crowd chanting his name. I said: \u201cAre you ready for it? Come on. Next year?\u201d And she looked at me with a twinkle in her eye and said: \u201cI\u2019m gonna do it.\u201d It was such a brilliant moment.\n\nPart of the excitement of creating the festival year on year is that we don\u2019t know how long it will go on for. It\u2019s like walking a tightrope, trying to keep everyone happy: the crew, the local community, the neighbouring farmers, the council and the emergency services. In 2016, when we had the relentless rain and mud, it was one of the most challenging years we\u2019ve ever had. I had a conference call with the authorities at 3am on the Wednesday, and some people were suggesting we should close the festival. It is really hard to make clearheaded decisions in situations like that, especially when everyone\u2019s working incredibly hard and not getting much sleep. But we managed to convince them we were definitely going ahead, even if it did feel quite touch and go for a few hours.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Revellers battle the mud at Glastonbury 2016.

There was an opinion poll done on site, which found that 83% of people at the festival had voted remain \u2013 including me and my dad \u2013 and a lot of people felt quite broken when the result came through. It was like they needed Adele and Glastonbury to help them through. And she gave us one of the most heart-wrenching headline performances I\u2019ve ever seen. She had such a connection with the audience that it felt as if she was out there in the crowd herself. And Christine and the Queens played on the afternoon of the referendum result and seemed to capture something very wonderful and European amid the doom and gloom. She was fantastic, and the whole set was totally joyous and uplifting.\n\nI think a lot of people stayed on site longer that year to postpone going back to the real world. It took a few months for a lot of our crew to recover. Everyone who works here pours a vast amount of energy into creating such a spectacular show; when conditions are hard it definitely takes longer to come back down to Earth afterwards. The festival completely takes over my life and the lives of my kids; there are so many reminders of how it was for me when I see it through their eyes. It can take over your whole body and soul.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Attenborough addresses the crowd from the Pyramid Stage, June 2019. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nI\u2019m proud that, throughout all the changes and the dramas, we\u2019ve stuck to our principles. We\u2019ve had so many speakers and campaigners over the years championing the messages of equality, fairness, sustainability and caring for each other. Our roots are totally on the left. We\u2019ve never been quiet or embarrassed about that. Throughout the 80s, we campaigned like mad, with a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on top of the Pyramid stage. And that campaigning has continued, whether it\u2019s speaking out against Brexit or pushing environmental campaigns.\n\nSign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras Read more\n\nMillions of people were made aware of our green initiatives and plastic bottles ban in 2019, and it\u2019s had a genuine wider impact, particularly thanks to Sir David Attenborough talking about the ban from the Pyramid stage on the Sunday afternoon. We\u2019ve already seen other organisations and events around the world being pressured into following suit, with the words, \u201cWell, if Glastonbury can do it \u2026\u201d We\u2019ve always wanted to use Glastonbury to make changes for the good of the planet, and it feels like we really managed it in 2019 \u2013 on a grand scale.\n\nWho knows what lies ahead and which new paths we will take with the festival, but whatever happens, our ethos will remain true to what it has always been. As we head into the next chapter of Glastonbury, we want to keep moving forward with sustainability at the heart of it all, creating an alternative universe for five days in which you can be whoever you want to be. Surely there\u2019s nowhere better on Earth.\n\nThis extract has been edited and condensed for length.", "description": "In an exclusive extract from a new book to celebrate Glastonbury festival\u2019s 50th anniversary, its organiser reflects on the time Prince almost played, how she wooed Adele and what it\u2019s like behind the scenes at Britain\u2019s biggest music event", "authors": ["Emily Eavis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e07ef0c6f4f2ee4aa0910d2eb5b61da2706645de/0_226_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e644118960a8b1e123c8970b26b7ae3e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
