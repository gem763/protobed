Last month, Moody\u2019s cut Turkey\u2019s rating deeper into junk citing, among other factors, erosion of institutional strength and the government\u2019s inability to implement measures to revive the economy. Similar problems also plague South Africa, said Christopher Shiells, a London-based emerging-market analyst at Informa.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s credit-rating troubles throw an uneasy light on South Africa,\u201d Shiells said. \u201cMoody\u2019s rationale for downgrading Turkey should be of concern for South Africa watchers as these are problems that beset South Africa.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s economy hasn\u2019t expanded by more than 2% a year since 2013, and endured recessions in 2009 and 2018. There\u2019s a chance it may be headed for another after the first-quarter contraction. Turkey\u2019s economy emerged from a recession in the first quarter.\n\nYet the cost of five-year credit-default swaps - insurance against a default - fell to 163 basis points on Wednesday, more than 200 below Turkey\u2019s. That suggests traders aren\u2019t hedging for the possibility of a downgrade.\n\n\u201cThere could be a widening out in South African spreads in the build-up to the November rating decision if economic fundamentals continue to deteriorate,\u201d said Shiells. The CDS spread could \u201cblow out\u201d as much as 200 basis points in the event of a downgrade, he said.\n\nThe blow-out could extend to bonds. Benchmark government bond yields are around the lowest since April 2018, leaving plenty of scope for a reversal in the event of a Moody\u2019s downgrade, which would spark a sell-off by funds that track investment-grade indexes.\n\nAnd while the country\u2019s foreign-currency debt is already considered junk - with ratings below investment level at S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings - that hasn\u2019t deterred investors. The bonds have returned 12.3% this year, beating the average return of 11% for the 629 member Bloomberg Barclays EM Hard Currency Aggregate Sovereign Total Return Index.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2048 securities are the top performers in BB category, with a return of 20%. The yield on the debt is at the lowest since the notes began trading in May 2018.\n\nA downgrade for the local-currency bonds to junk would have a \u201cspillover\u201d impact on the hard-currency notes, said Trieu Pham, a London-based emerging markets strategist at ING Bank NV.\n\n\u201cWith the external backdrop dominating, market pricing indeed doesn\u2019t factor in the risk of a Moody\u2019s downgrade,\u201d Pham said. \u201cA negative surprise would see an initial knee jerk reaction on the on the bonds.\u2019\u2019\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s currency, too, shows little sign of investor anxiety, with the premium of options to sell the rand versus the dollar over those to buy it at the lowest level since May 2018.
