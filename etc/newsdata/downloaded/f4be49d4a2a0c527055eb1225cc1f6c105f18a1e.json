REUTERS/Abdalghne Karoof\n\nFinance Minister Mamoun Hamdan said the cabinet approved \u201cnecessary and precautionary\u201d measures to mitigate the impact of sharp fluctuations in the local currency that drove it to a record low nearly two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe will impose checks on (prices) in the market and tighten supervision and hit monopolists and smugglers with an iron fist,\u201d Hamdan told reporters after a cabinet meeting.\n\nThe fall in the Syrian pound fell to a record low on the black market nearly two weeks ago was driven by a lack of central bank intervention and damage to the war-torn economy from tighter Western sanctions in the last year, dealers and businessmen said.\n\nAfter rising to a record of 690 to the dollar, the local currency has since improved and has been fluctuating around 620 to the dollar in the last week, dealers said. The pound had traded at 47 to the dollar before protests against President Bashar al-Assad erupted in March 2011.\n\nThe fall in the pound\u2019s purchasing power has driven up prices of most commodities across Syria, bankers and economists say.\n\nHamdan said the government would allocate more funds to a chain of hundreds of government-run superstores that sells consumer goods at prices lower than those prevailing in the market in a bid to bring down consumer prices. The central bank would also offer dollars at a preferential rate for traders importing much needed essential goods, he added.\n\nOther steps include interest-free government loans to state employees.\n\nThe crumbling of the currency has driven up inflation and aggravated hardship as many ordinary Syrians struggle to afford basics such as food and power.\n\nWith growing public anger over the rise in prices of basic goods, the Syrian government has blamed speculators and unnamed \u201cforeign hands\u201d for manipulating the currency markets. People have complained that shoppers hoarded some products, fearing the impact of the soaring dollar on the price of goods in the days ahead.\n\nPrime Minister Imad Khamis told Parliament on Sunday that the country was suffering from the impact of U.S.-led sanctions, which was imposing a siege on the economy and hurting ordinary Syrians\u2019 livelihoods.\n\nKhamis said the government had not intervened directly since 2016 to defend the local currency to help preserve what was left of depleted reserves, estimated by economists and bankers at $17 billion before the protests began.\n\n\u201cThis (intervention) policy in the past caused the depletion of a substantial part of the foreign currency reserves and encouraged speculation on the pound,\u201d Khamis said.\n\nThe pound had enjoyed almost two years of relative stability after Moscow, alongside Iranian-backed militias, turned the tide in favour of Assad by pushing rebels from large swathes of territory in Syria.\n\nCurrency stability had become Syria\u2019s economic confidence index and a sign of the government\u2019s ability to mitigate the effects of war and Western financial sanctions, bankers said.\n\nSyria, however, has been hit by expanded U.S. and European sanctions since November against Syrian businessmen close to Assad, which has scared wealthy Syrians abroad who had been considering opportunities in the war-ravaged economy.\n\nThe risk of sanctions against anyone trading with Syria has also deterred non-Americans from investing in post-war reconstruction, as long as Assad clings to power.\n\nMore than eight years of conflict has caused billions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage, disrupted agriculture, devastated industry and wiped out foreign currency income from tourism and oil exports.", "description": "Syria's cabinet announced on Monday a package of economic measures to help ease a currency crisis that has wreaked havoc on the war-torn - from tighter controls on spiralling prices to a crackdown on profiteers.", "authors": ["Suleiman Al-Khalidi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430640299&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G005", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
