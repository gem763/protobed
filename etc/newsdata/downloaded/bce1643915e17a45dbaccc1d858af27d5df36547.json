Taylor, 32, faces a maximum of 30 years in prison.\n\nTaylor was under the influence of alcohol during the Feb. 2 crash in Bowie that sent her car off the road and spinning into a snowy field off Route 301, prosecutors and police said. The group had been heading home around 4:30 a.m., police said, though it was not clear where they had been.\n\nThe crash killed Taylor\u2019s children \u2014 London Dixon, 8, and Paris Dixon, 5 \u2014 and their relatives Rickelle Ricks, 6; Zion Beard, 14; and Damari Herald, 15. None of the children were restrained in seat belts or car seats and were thrown from the vehicle during the crash, Prince George\u2019s County Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Jennifer Rush said. The five children were all in the three-seater bench of a 2005 Chrysler Pacifica, and one child who was lifted up out of the seat and tossed from the car \u201cgot caught up in the vines\u201d of a tree before he \u201clanded on the ground,\u201d Rush said.\n\nAbout two weeks after the crash, the front-seat passenger and a friend of Taylor\u2019s, Cornell D. Simon, 23, of Oxon Hill, Md., was taken off life support after being critically injured by the crash. He had been trapped in the vehicle after the crash, Rush said.\n\nTaylor had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.169, which is more than Maryland\u2019s legal limit of .08, police and prosecutors said. Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Aisha N. Braveboy said Taylor did not say where she was coming from or how many drinks she had before getting in the car.\n\nThe crash deeply divided the families of the dead. Before Taylor\u2019s plea hearing, an argument broke out in the hall outside the courtroom, sending deputies sprinting to the commotion that echoed through the halls. The deputies quickly separated the groups and broke up the altercation.\n\nDuring the hearing, when the judge was reading Taylor her rights, she spoke barely above a whisper and said she was on depression medication. When the judge asked, \u201cAre you in good health both mentally and physically,\u201d Taylor responded no but said she understood what was happening in court.\n\n\u201cAre you pleading guilty because you are guilty and for no other reason?\u201d the judge asked when the time came for Taylor to finalize her plea.\n\nShe stood silent for several moments before her attorney, John McKenna, leaned over to speak with her. She blew her nose and then finally said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMcKenna declined to comment after the hearing.\n\nBraveboy said the plea allows the families to avoid the trauma of a lengthy trial.\n\n\u201cA trial would have been probably unbearable for all parties involved,\u201d she said.\n\nTaylor is set to be sentenced on Jan. 13.\n\nHer plea comes the day after Charles County man Thomas Hawks was sentenced to 22 years in jail in an unrelated crash that happened months earlier.\n\nHawks, 28, said he had at least 10 beers while watching a Redskins game with friends before a crash that left three children dead on Dec. 30.\n\nDespite having a hotel room to stay in after the game, Hawks said during his sentencing, he got into his truck and drove home.\n\nAlong Indian Head Highway, he crashed into the Mejia family waiting at a red light, going 69 mph in an area with a speed limit of 45, prosecutors said. The crash killed twins Alexander and Rosalie Mejia, 5, and their 13-month old brother Isaac.\n\nHawks had a blood-alcohol reading of 0.17.\n\nRead more:\n\nCrash killing 3 children renews safety concerns on one of Md.\u2019s most dangerous roads\n\nHe had \u2018goals and a vision.\u2019 Jamel Kirkland is D.C.\u2019s eighth victim age 11 to 17 to be fatally shot this year.\n\nA 7-year-old is the key witness against the man charged in her little brother\u2019s death.
