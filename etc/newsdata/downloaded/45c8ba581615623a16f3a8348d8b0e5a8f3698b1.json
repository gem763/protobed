He told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge: \u201cI would want a deal that resembles the five pillars that we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nHe was contradicted by close ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, who told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show the same day that she would support attaching a referendum to any deal Johnson struck.\n\nCorbyn told the Commons Monday: \u201cTo pass this House, any deal needs to meet the needs of workers and businesses. That means including a new customs union, a close single market relationship and guarantees of worker\u2019s rights, consumer standards and environmental protections.\u201d He added that it should not undermine the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe speech comes as negotiators intensify talks in a push to get a deal between the U.K. and the EU agreed before European leaders meet in Brussels Thursday. Johnson is legally bound to seek an extension to the current Brexit deadline of October 31 if he does not get a deal through the Commons by October 19, despite having consistently opposed any extension to negotiations.\n\nBriefing notes attached to the speech say the government intends to negotiate a Brexit deal with \u201ca new protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland\u201d that does not include a backstop, a reference to the mechanism designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland that has been widely rejected by MPs. Achieving this depends on the outcome of U.K. officials\u2019 talks with the EU this week.\n\nThe document mentions a no-deal Brexit just once, saying: \u201cOn 4 September, the government set out its policy on post-exit immigration arrangements in a no deal scenario. Free movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October.\u201d\n\nIn the event of no deal, EU citizens will be able to apply for temporary immigration status before January 2021, which will give them the right to remain in the U.K. for three years.", "description": "\u2018The only legitimate way to sort Brexit now is to let the people decide with a final say,\u2019 Jeremy Corbyn says.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175843299-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
