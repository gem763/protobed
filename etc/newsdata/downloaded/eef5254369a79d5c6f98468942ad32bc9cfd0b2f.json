Boris Johnson accused him of \u2018running away from the judgment of the people\u2019.\n\nBoris Johnson during the general election debate in the Commons on Monday evening\n\nDoes it mean no election?\n\nNo. Immediately after the vote, Mr Johnson stood up in the Commons and announced he would publish a short Bill to change the law and set the date for an election on December 12.\n\nThis would require only a simple majority of MPs to succeed. He said the Commons couldn\u2019t \u2018keep the country hostage\u2019 any longer.\n\nWill the Bill get through?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear. Over the weekend the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, who both want an election, proposed a Bill similar to Mr Johnson\u2019s but with the date set for December 9.\n\nTonight Lib Dems suggested they wouldn\u2019t vote for Mr Johnson\u2019s later election date, potentially throwing a huge spanner in the works. The SNP said it wouldn\u2019t be \u2018dancing to Boris Johnson\u2019s tune\u2019.\n\nWould three extra days make much difference?\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, no. But there is some suggestion the Lib Dems and Labour would prefer an earlier poll because more students would be at university, potentially handing the opposition parties an advantage.\n\nHowever many major universities finish for Christmas on Friday, December 13. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is also concerned Mr Johnson could try to bring the Brexit Bill back and rush it through before polling day. That was effectively ruled out by No 10.\n\nWhat is in store tomorrow?\n\nEither the pro-election parties come to an agreement fast or they are going to run out of time to get a poll before Christmas. A full 25 working days must be allowed between Parliament dissolving and an election taking place.\n\nLabour abstained after Jeremy Corbyn issued a rambling explanation of why he was opposed to an election\n\nNo 10 insists an election on December 9 isn\u2019t possible, because there isn\u2019t enough time to get the Bill through \u2013 along with other essential parliamentary business \u2013 by close of play on Thursday. But if the election was slightly later there is enough time to get it through, in theory.\n\nWhat is No 10\u2019s view?\n\nDowning Street sources suggested that the Prime Minister might be prepared to compromise, by suggesting a \u2018range\u2019 of dates were possible between December 9 and 12.\n\nBut a decision has to be made quickly. If the Bill doesn\u2019t pass its second reading in the Commons tomorrow cleanly, then the pre-Christmas election is effectively off. Ministers cannot go any later than December 12 because they risk running into the Christmas period.\n\nCabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has warned that the 12th is the latest date or the election would mean turfing pantomimes, parties and nativity plays out of village halls and schools used as polling stations.\n\nAre there any other obstacles to a poll?\n\nIn theory the House of Lords could cause trouble and delay the Bill and MPs in the Commons could try to amend it with votes for 16- and 17-year-olds. But peers would be highly unwise to try to block the legislation and changing the franchise so late would make an election impossible. The Lib Dems and SNP would be killing off the election if they voted in favour of such changes.\n\nWhat about the Brexit Withdrawal Bill?\n\nNo 10 says the legislation to take Britain out of the European Union is dead until after the election. Sources suggested the Prime Minister would have been prepared to bring the Bill back this week if Labour pro-leave MPs agreed to back it through the Commons.
