On the stand, he alleged that Diplomats\u2019 Jim Jones is a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods. During cross-examination, prosecutors played an audio clip of a man, who 6ix9ine identified as Jim Jones, stating, \u201cNow he got to get violated,\u201d allegedly in reference to 6ix9ine.\n\nDuring his testimony, 6ix9ine referred to Jim Jones as a \u201cretired rapper.\u201d Jones released a new album called El Capo in May 2019. Earlier this year, during a radio appearance, Jones discussed 6ix9ine\u2019s cooperation with the federal government, stating, \u201cHe did some actions that he can\u2019t come back from, so his name non-mentionable,\u201d according to XXL.\n\nIn addition, according to Page Six, 6ix9ine said in court today that Cardi B is a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods. 6ix9ine also reportedly stated that he did not try to mimic Cardi\u2019s rise to fame. \u201cI knew who she was. I didn\u2019t pay attention,\u201d he said, according to Page Six.\n\nFollowing news of 6ix9ine\u2019s testimony, Atlantic Records denied to Billboard the rapper\u2019s claims that Cardi B is a member of Nine Trey. Earlier this year, Cardi told GQ\u2019s Caity Weaver, \u201cWhen I was 16 years old, I used to hang out with a lot of... Bloods. I used to pop off with my homies. And they\u2019d say, \u2018Yo, you really get it poppin\u2019. You should come home. You should turn Blood.\u2019 And I did. Yes, I did. And something that\u2014it\u2019s not like, oh, you leave. You don\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\nTekashi 6ix9ine Testifies at Trial That Cardi B and Jim Jones Are Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods More\n\nOriginally Appeared on Pitchfork\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "6ix9ine referred to Jim Jones as a \u201cretired rapper\u201d during his third day of testimony", "authors": ["Matthew Strauss", "Noah Yoo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MJsZMAgasrRGS_U0rc.Zeg--~B/aD0xMTQ2O3c9MjI5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pitchfork_606/e674fb8f9fb924fa511049cd55d462f2", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
