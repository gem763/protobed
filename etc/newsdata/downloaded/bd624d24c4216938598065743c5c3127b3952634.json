After all, it was nearly 20 years ago that he Hoovered up an entire building full of poltergeists in the original Luigi\u2019s Mansion. Then he cleared out six haunted houses in 2013's Dark Moon. As he enters a massive spook-infested hotel in this month\u2019s Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, one would expect him to handle things with a little more bravado this time. But alas.\n\nTeeth permanently achatter, ghost-sucking vacuum firmly in hand, Luigi returns to the land of the formerly alive in this new Switch game, available October 31. Despite how Luigi feels about the whole thing, I wouldn\u2019t call any of it especially scary, just a charming supernatural comedy in an environment packed with rich detail. There\u2019s lots to do in this haunted hotel and the core mechanic of catching ghosts stays fun the whole way through.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a mansion or a hotel, the gameplay remains the same: Creep slowly through a darkened building full of traps, vermin, ghosts, and treasure, methodically clearing out each floor of spirits and money, using a backpack-mounted vacuum to inhale the specters and put them into cold storage until such time as they are released again in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 4. Finish the floor and you\u2019ll be able to move on to the next, making your way up the floors until the whole thing\u2019s been fully exorcised.\n\nI\u2019m really just impressed that Nintendo is saying the \u201cH\u201d word via a pun here. (Screenshot: Kotaku, Nintendo)\n\nMoreover, whoever architected this place took a liberal approach to the concept of \u201chotel.\u201d While things begin with what you\u2019d expect\u2014the lobby, a restaurant, some guest rooms\u2014you eventually find yourself in a medieval castle and other places I won\u2019t spoil.\n\nBut wait, why is Luigi in a hotel, anyway? It\u2019s because the entire Mario crew has won a complimentary vacation stay there. This includes Mario, Luigi, Peach, and the three major varieties of Toad: Blue, Yellow, and Regular. Five of those people are immediately kidnapped when the hotel reveals its true colours, and it\u2019s up to Luigi to single-handedly rescue them.\n\nWell, double-handedly, as he has a new partner in slime: Gooigi, a replica of himself made entirely out of a mysterious viscous substance. (Who among us, I ask you, would not want this?) Gooigi is a fully-fledged second Luigi who can do almost anything his living counterpart can do, and you can plop him into the playfield at any time by clicking the right stick. Gooigi can pass through grates and pipes, accessing hidden areas or just clearing out lost coins from the sewage lines. Yes, that means that Gooigi actually does something that his dilettante namesake hasn\u2019t in decades: actual plumbing.\n\nOnce you unlock Gooigi early in the adventure, you can play through the whole of Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 in two-player co-op if you choose. I played through the whole game on my own, then did a brief co-op test to make sure everything seemed to work. We had no issues with it. The camera automatically zoomed out to try to keep both players on screen, and when they got too far apart, Gooigi just splatted through the floor and popped up again next to Luigi\u2019s position.\n\nNo, I have not read your Gooigi fanfic. (Screenshot: Nintendo)\n\nShould you decide to go solo, you\u2019ll still need to use Gooigi often, as many of the game\u2019s puzzles revolve around swapping between both characters. Fire and water will both instantly dissolve Gooigi, which comes into play a lot as you attempt to open up pathways.\n\nFortunately, you don\u2019t need to rely on Gooigi too much. It would be easy for a developer, having come up with this unique mechanic, to have the entire game be about juggling two different characters, and become tiresome. But for much of the game, Gooigi is optional. You can choose to use him during ghost fights\u2014a particular type of ghost has two tails, and Luigi and Gooigi can each grab one to do double damage\u2014but you\u2019re not forced to in most cases.\n\nBesides his gooey doppelganger, Luigi has a few more moves in the arsenal. The Poltergust G-00 vacuum can suck and blow objects with the L and R triggers, but pressing them both together will cause a big gust of air that shoots Luigi up about a foot into the air and scatters any objects at his feet. He can use the Dark Beam to reveal hidden objects. He can even shoot a plunger (more plumbing!) at objects, which creates a makeshift handle that lets you manipulate otherwise immovable pieces of furniture.\n\nWhile the hotel has 15 floors plus a couple basement levels, you\u2019ll only have access to a few of them at first. You\u2019ll collect elevator buttons, usually after fighting a boss, to continue your climb to the penthouse suite and the final confrontation. I didn\u2019t find myself especially antsy to keep climbing the tower, though, because it was fun to wring every last secret out of the floors before moving on.\n\nEach floor of the hotel has a unique theming to it, and each room is packed with detail, whether that be hidden passages leading to stashes of cash, puzzles concealing collectible gems, or just funny interactive objects. In one early example, I used the \u201cblow\u201d function of the Poltergust to roll up an area rug, which revealed a secret drain that Gooigi could drip through to find a gem.\n\nCollecting two ghosts at once: nice. (Screenshot: Nintendo)\n\nThe series\u2019 fundamental mechanic\u2014surprise ghosts with your flashlight, then vacuum them into your Poltergust when they\u2019re stunned\u2014is relatively unchanged here, although once you get a ghost firmly into your suction beam, you can rapidly press the A button to repeatedly body-slam them to the ground and quickly drain their energy and hurt nearby ghosts while you\u2019re at it. You have to flash your beam into a ghost\u2019s eyes before you can start vacuuming, and of course some ghosts protect their eyes in some way or another, so you\u2019ll have to figure out how to do that, first. But it\u2019s all fairly straightforward.\n\nNavigating the hotel itself is the biggest challenge\u2014puzzling through the passages, figuring out how to interact with each room\u2019s assortment of doodads to open the doors blocking the way. I enjoyed that the game was so dense with these puzzles, although I felt like they could have been clued a little better.\n\nIf the game sees that you\u2019re staring at a puzzle for too long, Professor E. Gadd will call in and tell you what to do next. I considered turning these hints off, but when they came through, my reaction was often \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think I would have gotten that on my own.\u201d I\u2019d rather have seen some of these puzzles clued in a more organic way versus text-based hints.\n\nBoss fights can be much the same; I would often spend a bit too much time just experimenting with every one of Luigi\u2019s abilities until I found the one that arbitrarily worked to break down the boss\u2019 defences. In general, though, these fights were always very clever, charming encounters that I enjoyed playing, so it didn\u2019t matter too much in the end.\n\nThe \u201cScarescraper\u201d multiplayer mode lets four Luigis team up to catch ghosts (or, in this case, collect Toads). (Screenshot: Kotaku, Nintendo)\n\nWhile the Poltergust is built for inhaling the residual spirits of the dead, you\u2019ll spend just as much time sucking up cold, hard cash. I don\u2019t know what criminal enterprise these people were running, but every nook and cranny of this place is stuffed with coins, gold bars, and stacks of greenbacks. Inhaling piles of money and watching your wallet expand is always a joy, although a little bit less so once you realise there\u2019s not a whole lot to spend it on.\n\nI was hoping for an upgrade system where I could spend money to do more damage to ghosts or take less damage from them, or unlock new areas with cash, or something along those lines. Instead, you can spend your money on just three things: an item that will revive you once if you run out of health, and two items that let you find the game\u2019s two optional sets of collectibles: hidden Boo ghosts and gems.\n\nSo you don\u2019t strictly need any of the things you can buy, then, although the Boos and gems can be rather tricky to find on one\u2019s own. I collected every cent I could find just for fun, but it was deflating to find that they weren\u2019t worth that much.\n\nLuigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is not a short game, especially compared to the 3-5 hour length of the original. The time on my game clock when I was done was a solid 17 hours, 40 minutes. That includes some hunting for optional gems, but not much time spent chasing after Boos, and I\u2019m sure I could get another 5 hours out of it if I wanted to cleanse the entire hotel of its secrets.\n\nShould you desire more multiplayer than the co-op campaign, Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 has you covered there as well. The \u201cScarescraper\u201d mode, which can be played either online or via local, multi-Switch play, lets an army of four Luigis take on a series of randomised floors. The goal of each floor could be to capture every ghost, or find all the Toads, or collect a certain amount of cash You can all immediately split up and tackle individual rooms, although you\u2019ll have to come together and cooperate at certain points, like to get through certain doors or if one of you is caught in a trap.\n\nLuigi's Mansion 3 BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE A scintillating follow-up to Hotel Mario. TYPE OF GAME Elevator repair simulator LIKED Varied environments packed with detail, solid core mechanic, funny presentation. DISLIKED Puzzles and boss fights can be abstruse, secret-finding doesn't change the game much. DEVELOPER Next Level Games PLATFORMS Nintendo Switch RELEASE DATE October 31, 2019 PLAYED Finished single-player game (about 17.5 hours), played some of each multiplayer mode.\n\nYou can press the D-pad to communicate basic phrases like \u201cOver here\u201d or \u201cHelp,\u201d although you could also use the Switch\u2019s mobile app to do voice chat. (I loaded up the app to verify that it appeared, but didn\u2019t end up using it.) There are also power-up items scattered liberally around the maps that give you the option to see hidden stuff, flash an entire room full of ghosts at once, et cetera. This, coupled with the strict timer on every floor, makes Scarescraper a more frantic experience.\n\nFinally, there are three mini-games that can be played by up to eight players on a single Switch. These are fairly simple, short, single-round, team-based games that are quite fun but unlikely to be played more than a few times each. (If I\u2019m wrong and a Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 esports scene develops, I will issue a heartfelt apology.)\n\nIt\u2019s the sheer variety of experiences in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 that keeps it entertaining throughout. While you might at first think you\u2019re in for a repetitive time as you go through the first few floors and find nothing but standard hotel rooms, things get quite unexpected as you continue higher and higher. While it doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel, it\u2019s a solid take on a series that hasn\u2019t had many entries over the last nearly 20 years. Mostly, it\u2019s just nice to see that Luigi is indeed alive, and not dead.", "description": "Why is Luigi still scared of ghosts?
