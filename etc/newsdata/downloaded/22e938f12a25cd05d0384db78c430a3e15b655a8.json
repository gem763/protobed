Kamala Harris (D-CA) is backing Virginia state lawmaker Kathy Tran, who proposed the legislation that would have allowed abortion in the state even as a woman is about to give birth.\n\n\u201cShe has endured, she has persevered, and, all the while, with courage, she has been one of the strongest leaders that we have,\u201d Harris said about Tran, reported the Washington Examiner.\n\n\u201cShe is somebody who never puts up her finger and says, \u2018Oh, is this going to be popular or not?\u2019 You know that,\u201d Harris added. \u201cYou know she\u2019s taken on huge fights, in particular for the women of Virginia and the families that love them, saying it\u2019s not about what\u2019s popular at the moment. It\u2019s about what\u2019s right. And these are the kinds of leaders we need in our statehouses.\u201d\n\nTran, who turned her seat in the Virginia House of Delegates from red to blue, proposed an abortion measure in January that set off a firestorm around the country and led to a national controversy over \u201cinfanticide\u201d for Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, who backed her legislation.\n\nThe state lawmaker\u2019s bill would not only have allowed abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy in the state, but would have also permitted a woman to decide whether she wants to \u201cabort\u201d her baby as she is dilating and about to give birth.\n\nTran proposed the Repeal Act as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed into law the Reproductive Health Act, which eliminated recognition of \u201cpersonhood\u201d in the unborn and defined a \u201cperson\u201d as a \u201chuman being who has been born and is alive.\u201d Pro-life groups referred to the New York law as permitting \u201cinfanticide.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia measure, which was ultimately tabled, would have eliminated the requirement that abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy be performed in a hospital, as well as the requirement of an ultrasound prior to an abortion. It also would have ended the requirement that two other physicians certify the necessity of a third-trimester abortion.\n\nNortham\u2019s comments during an appearance on WTOP-FM heightened the controversy over the bill when he commented on an \u201cinfant\u201d delivered when the mother chose abortion while she is dilating:\n\nIf a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\n\nAfter those comments, a spokesperson for the governor attempted to clarify his remarks by saying, \u201cThe governor\u2019s comments were limited to the actions physicians would take in the event that a woman [facing nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities] went into labor.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights activists immediately went into defense mode with the narrative that abortions performed at the point of birth are only carried out due to severe risks to the mother\u2019s health or serious fetal anomalies.\n\nHowever, a study the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute released in 2013 found women seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying their abortions, including \u201cnot knowing about the pregnancy,\u201d \u201ctrouble deciding about the abortion,\u201d and \u201cdisagreeing about the abortion with the man involved.\u201d\n\nThe study found that \u201cmost women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.\u201d\n\nIn response to Tran\u2019s proposed legislation, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) said at the time, \u201cI don\u2019t care what party you\u2019re from \u2014 if you can\u2019t say that it\u2019s wrong to leave babies to die after birth, get the hell out of public office.\u201d\n\nSenator @BenSasse did not mince words in response to comments from @GovernorVA today on #HB2491 pic.twitter.com/wRLyemuMxg \u2014 The Daily Signal (@DailySignal) January 30, 2019\n\nIn January, a Marist poll found 75 percent of Americans want substantial restrictions on abortion, including 60 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of those who identify as \u201cpro-choice.\u201d", "description": "Kamala Harris is backing Virginia state lawmaker Kathy Tran, who proposed a bill that would have allowed abortion as a woman is dilating.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Kamala-Harris-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
