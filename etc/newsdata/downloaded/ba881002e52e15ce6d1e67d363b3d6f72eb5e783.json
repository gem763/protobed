President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could sign a partial deal as soon as next month.\n\nUnder that deal, China agreed to raise its agricultural purchases to between $40 billion and $50 billion from $8 billion to $16 billion and to make certain reforms on intellectual property and financial services. The U.S. will not raise tariffs on Oct. 15 from 25 percent to 30 percent. It\u2019s still unclear whether Trump plans to halt another round of tariffs that are set to take effect on Dec. 15.", "description": "The IMF said its latest World Economic Outlook\u00a0forecast 2019 GDP growth at 3 percent, down from 3.3\u00a0percent from its April outlook.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/AP19134676624733.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
