Parents of U.K. Teen Allegedly Killed by Diplomat\u2019s Wife Not Worried About Political Fight After Trump Meeting", "language": "en", "text": "Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn say they made a deathbed promise to seek justice for their son \u2014 and they have every intention to keep it.\n\nJust two days after the pair took part in a bizarre White House meeting in which President Donald Trump attempted to ambush them with a surprise meeting with the woman believed to have struck and killed their 19-year-old son, Harry Dunn, the grieving parents tell TIME they cannot understand what the American government expects them to do, and they will not simply accept that their son\u2019s suspected killer may be exempt from prosecution because she is the wife of a diplomat.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Dunn tells TIME.\n\nAnne Sacoolas, the wife of an American diplomat, is suspected to have struck Harry Dunn on his motorcycle in August, and then fled to the U.S. after claiming diplomatic immunity, igniting pressure on the U.S. to waive that immunity and allow the U.K. to press charges against her.\n\nThe parents came to the U.S. in an effort to persuade the U.S. government officials to reconsider Sacoolas\u2019 immunity \u2014 a law that protects diplomats and their family members from prosecution in the country that they are based \u2014 and were shocked when a vague invitation to the White House led to a meeting with the President himself. They were even more stunned when Trump tried to cajole them into meeting Sacoolas, whom they were told was also inside the building. Although they previously called Trump \u201cgracious\u201d during the meeting, they said he seemed surprised when they declined to agree to the unexpected meeting with Sacoolas.\n\n\u201cIt became quite evident then that he was hoping we were just going to just say \u2018Oh great, okay,'\u201d Charles tells TIME. Trump didn\u2019t know that the family had already decided against ever meeting Sacoolas unless it was on U.K. soil and with grief counselors who could help their healing process.\n\nOn August 27, Harry Dunn was riding his bike near an Air Force base run by the U.S. government when Sacoolas was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road and struck him head on. Tim Dunn was able to arrive on the scene about 40 minutes later. He found his son with broken bones and finding it hard to breath. When first responders sedated Harry, Tim Dunn says he had no idea he would never be able to talk to his son again: \u201cI knew he had broken bones, but at no time did I think he was going to die.\u201d\n\nThe parents initially thought justice would be easy and swift, considering the evidence against Sacoolas that police have gathered, and her original willingness to cooperate with the investigation \u2014 and are now coping with a different reality as they also work through their grief.\n\n\u201cOf course we thought that was going to be so straightforward,\u201d Charles says, fighting back tears. \u201cBut we promised him. He was a man of his word, and he looked out for everybody and he was a very honest boy. And that\u2019s why we find ourselves in this situation, because we wouldn\u2019t be honoring him if we didn\u2019t go through with this.\u201d\n\nThe family is wrapping up their visit to the U.S. and returning home on Friday morning. After they are back in the U.K. they say they have no plans to stop their battle. \u201cYou can\u2019t just expect us to walk away,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cI can\u2019t understand what the American government is expecting us, as a family, to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Harry, it\u2019s not about politics,\u201d Charles adds. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be about the governments and it shouldn\u2019t be us worrying about this becoming a political brawl or whatever. It\u2019s about our boy, and making sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to another family.\u201d\n\nWho was Harry Dunn?\n\nHarry Dunn was 19 and just embracing self-acceptance at the time of his death, his parents say. He had made it past his difficult teenage years and had grown up to love motorcycles and reggae, hip hop and dance music. \u201cThis last year I had never known him so happy,\u201d Tim Dunn says. \u201cEverything seemed to be just dropping into place for him.\u201d\n\nCharles and Tim Dunn divorced when Harry and his twin brother, Niall, were about a year old. Each has since remarried and their families have stayed close, living only five miles apart, in order to raise Harry and Niall together.\n\n\u201cThe boys have gelled us together,\u201d Charles says. \u201cNow, 50% of that gel is gone.\u201d\n\nHarry wanted to spend the rest of his life traveling the world on his motorcycle, Charles says, adding that he had logged more than 50,000 miles on his bike in three-and-a-half years. He had been in an accident once before, but the driver involved in that incident admitted they were at fault, Charles says.", "description": "Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn tell TIME they made a deathbed promise to seek justice", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cYw3.uhDN8dvXkUq4ZLs3A--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/30afa15371472dd8495714877bd6ea87", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
