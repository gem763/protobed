It has lost 90% from a Sept. 26, 2018 high of $35.80, and is 80% lower than its July 2018 initial public offering price of $15.\n\nShort seller Hindenburg Research said it found an estimated $2.2 billion in undisclosed serving liabilities.\n\n\u201cBloom\u2019s tricky accounting allows it to mask servicing costs and shift write-downs to other periods, thereby avoiding recognizing major recent additional losses,\u201d Hindenburg said in a research note. \u201cWe believe that large debt maturities in 2020 and 2021, amounting to nearly $520 million, make Bloom Energy an obvious bankruptcy candidate.\u201d\n\nThe company \u201cwill become yet another tombstone in the Silicon Valley cemetery of dead unicorns,\u201d Hindenburg said.\n\nBloom Energy responded by stating in a release Wednesday the Hindenburg report contained \u201cfactual inaccuracies, misleading allegations and drew erroneous conclusions,\u201d including about the future viability of the company.\n\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with the conclusions drawn,\u201d Bloom said in an initial statement on Tuesday. \u201cIn particular, the service replacement liability mentioned in the report is grossly misleading.\n\nThe analysts at Hindenburg did not engage with the company, Bloom added.\n\nBloom makes solid oxide fuel cells that are used in on-site, stationary power-generation servers. The servers convert natural gas or biogas into electricity through an electrochemical reaction, which results in lower emissions, the company says.\n\nBloom Energy\u2019s shares fell 43% on Aug. 13 on concerns that clean-energy initiatives in key states, such as bans or halts in new natural-gas connections, could end up hurting the company.\n\nHindenburg claimed that Bloom\u2019s technology is \u201cnot sustainable, clean, green or remotely profitable.\u201d\n\nBloom said Wednesday that from 2016 through 2018, its fuel cells have an average life of 4.8 to 5.2 years. \u201cAt these expected fuel cell lives, Bloom estimates future service revenue will exceed future service cost, resulting in longer-term service profit,\u201d Bloom stated.\n\nBloom priced its initial public offering last year at the top of the range. It slid below the IPO price by late 2018. It closed above the IPO price just four times this year, the last time on May 3. It has traded in the single digits since early August.\n\nThe shares are down 67% this year, contrasting with gains of 20% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.26%", "description": "Bloom Energy is destined to become yet another dead \u2018unicorn,\u2019 short seller says, bringing the stock down 20% on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Claudia Assis", "Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP328_bloom__ZG_20190813121515.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
