I hope our British friends decide to return one day. Our door will always be open.\u2019\n\nIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar told the press conference that he had mixed feelings towards the end of negotiations.\n\nHe said he was happy there would be no hard border between the north and south of Ireland \u2013 but regretful that Britain had chosen to go its separate ways.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I have learned two things about the EU while Taoiseach,\u2019 he said. \u2018The strength of the unity of the EU, how much we can achieve if the 27 work together with common objectives, a truly powerful force for good in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a small nation I have felt enormous solidarity from my European partners, and I think it\u2019s been demonstrated in the past few years is a union of peoples and one in which small states are protected.\n\n\u2018I have mixed feelings today, I regret the UK is leaving but respect the decision to do so, like an old friend going on a journey without us, and we really hope it works out for them. There will always be a place at the table for them if they ever want to come back.\n\nThe decision now moves to the House of Commons for them to consider the agreement.\n\nMPs now have two days to mull over the content of the new deal before a vote on Saturday.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said he was \u2018confident\u2019 of success and that we would leave the bloc on October 31.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, and Michel Barnier, the EU\\\u2019s Chief Brexit Negotiator, ahead of the opening sessions of the European Council summit (Picture: PA)\n\nHowever, he faces an uphill struggle as the DUP, Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems have all said they cannot support the new deal.\n\nThe EU Parliament will also need to ratify the agreement.\n\nAnnouncing the last-minute Brexit deal, Mr Johnson said: \u2018We will leave the EU\u2019s Customs Union as one United Kingdom and be able to strike trade deals all around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This new deal ensures that we #TakeBackControl of our laws, borders, money and trade without disruption & establishes a new relationship with the EU based on free trade and friendly cooperation. \u2018This is a deal which allows us to get Brexit done and leave the EU in two weeks\u2019 time, so we can then focus on the people\u2019s priorities and bring the country back together again.\u2019\n\nHowever the DUP \u2013 which wields influence over Tory Brexiteers and props up Mr Johnson\u2019s minority government \u2013 have already said they do not support it.\n\nLabour have already called it a \u2018sell-out deal\u2019 with leader Jeremy Corbyn saying there should be a second referendum so that voters get the final say.\n\nHe said the new deal was worse than the one Theresa May negotiated, which was rejected by Westminster three times.\n\nThe Lib Dems said the \u2018bad deal\u2019 meant they were now \u2018more determined than ever\u2019 to stop Brexit.\n\nMPs have already made a no-deal Brexit illegal and if it fails to pass the House of Commons this weekend, Mr Johnson could be forced to beg the EU for another extension.\n\nSources at Number 10 say the PM will tell EU leaders to rule out any more delay, making clear it\u2019s \u2018the new deal or no deal but no delays.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
