Latest in Britain-EU talks", "language": "en", "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has pushed back against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s assertion that a new Brexit deal was in the making.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit demonstrators display their placards as they protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nA month before a make-or-break EU leaders\u2019 summit and some six weeks before Britain is due out, Johnson asked on Tuesday to intensify talks, while the bloc implored London to present workable proposals to unlock an agreement.\n\nJohnson\u2019s negotiator David Frost held four rounds of talks with the bloc recently as London pushes to ditch the contentious backstop clause that could tie Britain to EU trading rules after Brexit to preserve the seamless border between EU member Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland.\n\nThe EU demands that London proposes specific written proposals if it wants to replace the backstop, while the U.K. side says it is unwilling to reveal its hand too early.\n\nHere are technical details of what Frost discussed with Brussels about both the formal divorce treaty and a post-Brexit political agreement on future ties, as reported by EU and British officials and diplomats.\n\nDIVORCE TREATY\n\nBritain\u2019s legal withdrawal agreement from the EU.\n\n- CHECKS OF ANIMALS AND FOOD PRODUCTS\n\nLondon agreed to \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d of rules in Northern Ireland after Brexit to preserve an \u201call-island\u201d economy for animals and food products. It wants to include a mechanism of consent for \u201cinstitutions and parties\u201d in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe EU would only consider such a solution as a viable alternative to the backstop if it guarantees Northern Ireland would copy-paste all the bloc\u2019s rules in this area after Brexit.\n\nWith agri-food items making up around a third of goods crossing the sensitive Irish border, that could solve part of the puzzle in a positive scenario, but not all of it.\n\nThe EU and UK also agreed to preserve the single electricity market and a common travel area on the island.\n\n- CUSTOMS CHECKS\n\nThe EU side says UK negotiators proposed no complete architecture for a customs solution replacing the backstop.\n\nLondon would rather have more general clauses included in its divorce deal that would only be developed in detail during the status-quo transition period after Brexit when the sides aim to negotiate a new free trade deal.\n\nLondon is ready to legally commit itself to that work and proposed to continue upgrading any solutions found at the end of the transition period further down the line.\n\nThe EU stresses the U.K. side admitted those \u201calternative arrangements\u201d it is proposing, which would mostly be based on technology (e.g. electronic pre-clearance), would not be immediately operable after Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018trust us\u2019 on steroids,\u201d one senior EU diplomat said disparagingly, stressing that the bloc does not want to swap a solid solution for a mere promise of trying to find one later.\n\n- CHECKS ON INDUSTRIAL GOODS\n\nUK sought discreet controls - \u201cde-dramatised, de-materialised, de-localised\u201d - occurring in market places, at producers\u2019 venues, in ports and on ferries away from the actual Irish border.\n\nFrost proposed a maximum level of facilitation and simplification for these checks complemented with as much easing of these controls as possible along the lines of a mechanism the EU uses for so-called \u201ctrusted traders\u201d.\n\nThe EU awards the title to companies, including manufactures or freight operators with international supply chains or who export outside the bloc, that meet its standards and can benefit from quicker customs controls.\n\nThe EU said, however, that given Britain\u2019s declared aim to move away from the bloc\u2019s regulations, UK companies might not be eligible or additional compliance checks would be needed.\n\nCurrently, Britain has about 600 companies registered as trusted traders in the EU, while Germany has 6,000.\n\n\u201cThese are aspirational concepts that are not fleshed out enough to be translated into legal texts,\u201d another EU diplomat said.\n\n- VAT\n\nThis has not been covered in any detail so far beyond London stating a general ambition that the UK and the EU would be separate territories in that regard after Brexit.\n\nNEW EU-UK DEAL\n\nA political declaration that is not legally binding describes future ties between the EU and Britain after Brexit and makes a package with the separation deal.\n\n- \u201cBEST IN CLASS\u201d TRADE AGREEMENT\n\nBritain has made clear it wants to be free to distance itself from EU rules on anything from state aid to labour, climate and production standards after Brexit, and seal a \u201cbest in class\u201d free trade deal with the bloc.\n\nLondon wants no tariffs or quotas to limit the trade exchange but the EU has said the idea for now lacks detail.\n\n- LEVEL PLAYING FIELD (LPF)\n\nThe UK wants to water down the current wording on the so-called level playing field and introduce more general clauses on fair competition that are standard in usual free trade deals.\n\nThe EU says Britain is too big, too close and too economically powerful to get a trade deal without solid commitments on the level playing field to ensure the bloc\u2019s single market is not exposed to illicit goods or dumping prices.\n\nBritain says the lower level of access to the EU market it would seek must be reflected in more lax LPF clauses.\n\n- EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE\n\nEscaping the jurisdiction of the bloc\u2019s top court, the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ), has been at the heart of the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe bloc had agreed modalities of the ECJ role vis-a-vis the UK after Brexit with Britain\u2019s former prime minister, Theresa May, but that deal stalled.\n\nFrost asked to replace an overarching reference to the ECJ from the political declaration with more general clauses on the sides\u2019 legal autonomy and provisions for conflict resolution.\n\nThe bloc insists the ECJ must be firmly in the picture in the new relationship regarding interpretation of EU laws, settling disputes, and LPF, as well as for law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.\n\n- DEFENCE\n\nThe existing political declaration aims for a \u201cclose and lasting cooperation\u201d in defence. London seeks to highlight more that the area is a sovereign affair of both sides.", "description": "The European Union has pushed back against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's assertion that a new Brexit deal was in the making.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430832505&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0X1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
