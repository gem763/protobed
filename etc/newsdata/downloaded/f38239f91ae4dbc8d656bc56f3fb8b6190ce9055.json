An animated fable set in contemporary China and voiced in colloquial English, this Chinese-American co-production is so distinctive pictorially, and so manifestly good-hearted, that it\u2019s easy to forgive if not quite forget the ragged quality of its storyline.\n\nMore Film Reviews \u2018Judy\u2019\n\nThe title derives from the premise, which is relatively straightforward. A teenage kid living in a huge city that looks a lot like Shanghai finds a frightened yeti\u2014an abominable snowman\u2014hiding on the roof of her apartment building. Once she and two male friends realize that he\u2019s actually a snowkid, a sweet little monster with magical powers, they name him Everest and embark on a 2,000-mile journey to reunite him with his family in the Himalayas.\n\nThe yeti, who bears a strong family resemblance to a plush squeeze-toy, is a pleasing presence and a pleasant pretext. If truth be told he doesn\u2019t have much personality, but the human kids are funny and interesting, especially Yi, the girl who discovers him. (She\u2019s voiced, warmly, by Chloe Bennet. ) Yi has magical powers too, though she doesn\u2019t realize it at first. She plays exquisite music on her treasured violin, the same instrument her father played before he died. She doesn\u2019t have to worry about whether her music will soothe Everest, since he\u2019s as far from savage as a beast can get. Still, Yi won me over every time she put bow to strings, and she\u2019s the clear heroine of the piece, which was written and directed by Jill Culton. ( Todd Wilderman was co-director.) Yi (voiced by Chloe Bennet), Peng (voiced by Albert Tsai) and Everest (voiced by Joseph Izzo) Photo: UNIVERSAL STUDIOS At its most affecting, \u201cAbominable\u201d is an interspecies love story in which a trio of devoted teens protect a prodigy of nature from corporate baddies who, having found the innocent creature, are determined to exploit him. If that sounds like \u201cKing Kong\u201d crossbred with elements of \u201cE.T.\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d so be it; you can add Androcles and the lion to the mix. Original storytelling isn\u2019t the production\u2019s strong suit. Neither is narrative clarity; the journey across China becomes a choppy, repetitive chase. The beauty of the film lies in its vivid colors and tumbling images of rural vastness, riparian grace, streams populated by legions of koi, resplendent Yellow Mountains and giant blueberries that explode like party balloons. It\u2019s all much too much, and more than sufficient to make \u201cAbominable\u201d memorable. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
