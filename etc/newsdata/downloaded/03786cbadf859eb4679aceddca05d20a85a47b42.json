We own that, and we are fixing them.\u201d\n\nA key lawmaker said Monday that Boeing BA, +0.31% should have got things right the first time, before the Max began carrying passengers.\n\nMuilenburg is scheduled to testify Tuesday before the Senate Commerce Committee, then again on Wednesday before the House Transportation Committee. Boeing released his prepared statement Monday.\n\nThe appearances come as Boeing faces investigations by both committees and a criminal probe by the Justice Department. It is also being sued by families of some of the 346 people who died in the crash of a Max off the coast of Indonesia on Oct. 29, 2018, and another in Ethiopia on March 10.\n\nIn their final report on the first crash, Indonesia investigators said last week that Boeing\u2019s design of a key flight-control system made the plane vulnerable if a single sensor failed \u2014 disregarding the aviation industry\u2019s long reliance on redundant systems to prevent disaster. They also faulted Lion Air, which operated the plane, and U.S. regulators who approved it for flight.\n\nMost pilots did not know about the flight-control system, called MCAS, until after the Lion Air crash. At Boeing\u2019s request, an explanation about it was excluded from pilot manuals. In his statement, Muilenburg said, \u201cOur airline customers and their pilots have told us they don\u2019t believe we communicated enough about MCAS \u2014 and we\u2019ve heard them.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he will ask why Boeing didn\u2019t tell the Federal Aviation Administration about changes during development of the Max that made MCAS more powerful. He suggested that Boeing concealed the true power of MCAS to discourage regulators from examining the system more closely.\n\nOn both fatal flights, a faulty sensor caused MCAS to push the nose down, and pilots were unable to save the planes. Boeing is now making the nose-down pitch less frequent and powerful, and it is adding redundancy by tying it to two sensors and two computers instead of one each at a time.\n\n\u201cThey seem to have done what they should have done to begin with, which is they made the system less radical,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cThere are numerous regulators looking at this, it isn\u2019t just going to be the FAA. This will be the most thoroughly scrutinized fix in the history of the aviation industry.\u201d\n\nCongress is expected to consider changes to the way FAA certifies new planes and its practice of deputizing employees of Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers to perform safety tests on key components.\n\nSome relatives of passengers who died want Boeing banned from conducting safety reviews \u2014 they want FAA inspectors to do all that work. Such a change would require a big increase in FAA\u2019s budget. According to DeFazio, there are about 45 FAA inspectors overseeing 1,200 Boeing employees who conduct much of the actual testing.\n\nSeveral relatives of Max victims want Muilenburg to pay a personal price for the accidents and Boeing\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think Muilenburg should be CEO anymore,\u201d said Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya was on the Ethiopian Airlines Max. \u201cHe presided through this, minimizing it, trying to convince everyone it was pilot error, everything was fine, it\u2019s a safe plane. Everything so far has been dissembling, denial, pointing the finger somewhere else.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg, who is expected to meet with some of the family members Wednesday, was stripped of his title as chairman of the Boeing board earlier this month. The most senior executive dismissed so far was the head of Boeing\u2019s commercial airplanes division, Kevin McAllister.\n\nBoeing said that on Monday evening Muilenburg visited Indonesia\u2019s embassy in Washington to meet the ambassador and offer condolences to the Indonesian people.", "description": "On the anniversary of the first of two deadly crashes involving 737 Max jets, Boeing\u2019s CEO will tell Congress that the aircraft company knows it made...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU173_737max_ZG_20191028195102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
