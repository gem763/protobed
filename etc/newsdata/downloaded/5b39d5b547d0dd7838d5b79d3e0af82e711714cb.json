It was the third hearing Democrats have held on the issue of white supremacy.\n\nThe hearings came after a number of high-profile mass shootings in recent months by alleged white supremacists, including last month\u2019s shooting at an El Paso, Texas, Wal-Mart that left 22 people dead and two mosque shootings in Christchurch New Zealand that killed 50 worshipers earlier this year.\n\nBut Ms. Owens charged that Democrats on the panels weren\u2019t interested in actually addressing white nationalist terror, which she described as \u201creal,\u201d but \u201cuncoordinated, isolated.\u201d\n\nInstead, she said, Democrats were trying to scare African Americans into supporting their party in the upcoming 2020 election.\n\n\u201cTerms like white nationalism, which today and in this room and upon this floor, most nearly means that it is election time, America,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is time for the left to do what they do best, divide, distract and and hope to keep the most important voting block to their party \u2014 African Americans \u2014 angry, emotional and reactive enough to keep voting for the same party that has systematically destroyed our families, sent our men to prison and deferred all of our dreams.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks, Ms. Owens called for Democrats to hold hearings on topics she said posed greater threats to the African American community, including absentee fatherhood, illiteracy and abortion.\n\n\u201cWhite nationalism also sounds a lot better than abortion as a threat, which has resulted in the slaughter of 18 million black Americans since 1973. \u2026 In major cities like New York, we have more black babies being aborted than being born alive. If we are talking about white supremacy, we should probably have a conversation about that,\u201d she said.\n\nFBI Director Christopher A. Wray said in July the agency has made about 100 domestic terrorism-related arrests since October and the majority were tied to white supremacy.\n\nMs. Owens was one of three panelists speaking at the hearing, which included testimony from two terrorism experts.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
