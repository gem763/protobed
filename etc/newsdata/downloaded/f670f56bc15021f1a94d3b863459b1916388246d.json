For months at a time, he crisscrossed the country in an erratic route he likens to a Jackson Pollock painting. Among his many trips, he has traveled to Hawaii\u2019s farthest inhabited island, owned by a family of Scottish ranchers, where the Japanese landed during World War II; he has located the Rigby, Idaho, farm where a young Philo Farnsworth first found inspiration that led to the invention of the electric television; and he paid tribute to the North Carolina highway where legendary African-American heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson died in a car crash.", "description": "From coast to coast, Andrew Carroll sought out and exposed America\u2019s forgotten history.", "authors": ["Nina Strochlic"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492784524/articles/2013/05/14/meet-america-s-indiana-jones-andrew-carroll-searches-for-forgotten-history-across-the-u-s/130514-strochlic-carroll-tease-embed_wb6m4u", "published_at": "2013-05-14"}
