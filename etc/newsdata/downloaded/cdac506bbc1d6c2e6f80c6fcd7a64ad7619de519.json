Switzerland has the lowest percentage of women runners\n\nThe rising popularity of ultra marathons and other extreme running events may also have contributed to some declines in completion times as fewer expert or experienced runners are among those still competing.\n\nAverage completion times for both men and women have gone up over the last 30 years.\n\nMarathon completion times have gone up for both men and women, something researchers say could be caused by expert runners shifting focus to ultra marathons and other extreme races\n\nIn 1988, the average woman finished a marathon in four hours and 13 minutes.\n\nIn 2018, the average finish time for women had risen to four hours and 51 minutes.\n\nFor men the finish time in 1988 was three hours and 45 minutes and in 2018 had risen to four hours and 21 minutes.", "description": "Running is one of the oldest exercises in the world, and the average age of runners is starting to reflect that fact.
