Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told \"America's Newsroom\" on Thursday that former FBI Director James Comey needs to be held accountable for his previous \"inconsistencies\" and \"lack of candor and transparency\u201d with President Trump.\n\n\u201cJames Comey\u2019s problems are just now starting,\u201d Meadows said when addressing the upcoming release of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s report on the FBI\u2019s alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nDOJ WATCHDOG WILL \u2018ASSESS\u2019 ALLEGATIONS OF IRREGULARITIES IN COMEY TESTIMONY\n\nHorowitz -- who's been conducting high-profile probes related to the FBI and DOJ\u2019s actions in the Russia investigation \u2013 told lawmakers Wednesday his investigators will \u201cassess\u201d new Republican allegations of \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Comey\u2019s congressional testimony.\n\nHorowitz made the comments during an appearance before a House Oversight Committee hearing with other inspectors general.\n\n\u201cIt was more a matter of what they didn\u2019t tell than what they did tell,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nMeadows said that Comey told the president he wasn\u2019t under investigation at the same time he was \"intentionally\" trying to investigate an obstruction of justice case. He said that they found out from the inspector general\u2019s report that he was being investigated.\n\nREP. JORDAN BACKS UP MCCARTHY'S REMARK THAT US ALMOST HAD 'COUP' FROM TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE\n\nMeadows said Republicans sent a referral to Horowitz to investigate inconsistencies in Comey\u2019s testimonies. \u201cWe started to see that what he told congressional investigators and what he told the inspector general, did not line up, they were not consistent,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Wednesday, Meadows told Horowitz he believes Comey gave conflicting information when his closed-door testimony in December 2018 is compared against what\u2019s in Horowitz\u2019s latest report. That report, released last month, found that Comey violated bureau policies by drafting, leaking and retaining memos documenting private discussions with Trump.\n\n\u201cThe only thing consistent about James Comey is his willingness to go after this president,\" Meadows said, \"and it is time to hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Rep.
