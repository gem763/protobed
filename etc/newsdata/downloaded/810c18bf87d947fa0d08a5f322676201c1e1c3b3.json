In the 1970s, large public gatherings were usually only permissible by virtue of an order from the country\u2019s communist government. When Panenka scored, though, convention went out of the window pretty quickly.\n\n\u201cIn Czechoslovakia, it was a common thing that the Communist Party order people to go to the streets and welcome politicians from East Germany or the Soviet Union,\u201d he says. \u201cBut after Belgrade people went onto the streets voluntary, and everyone was happy. I mean everyone - kids, old people, men, women. Even now, all these years on, I get people here stopping me in the street wanting to talk about that goal.\n\n\u201cIn that final against (West) Germany I was not nervous at all. In the shootout, I knew that this way was the best chance to score. When it went in I was so happy not because I scored the last penalty, but because we won this amazing trophy as such a small nation.\u201d\n\nAs Panenka explains, though, his penalty was no fluke. \u201cI practised it for two years before the 1976 Euros,\u201d he says. \u201cI just figured that every keeper always jumps to one side, so it could be good to kick the ball in the middle (of the goal).\n\n\u201cAfter every practice, I competed with our goalkeeper (Zdenek) Hru\u0161ka in penalties. He was really good. I was losing a lot of money and chocolates.\n\n\u201cThen I started to use my little trick, and suddenly I was more often winning. That was the good thing. The bad thing was that I was getting fatter because of all the chocolates I won off him.\u201d\n\nHe obviously didn\u2019t know it at the time, but the chip he pioneered has since become one of football\u2019s greatest sights. The goalkeeper left sitting squarely on his backside as the ball sails, almost mockingly, into the back of the net.\n\nIt can also go wrong, as Jevani Brown of Colchester will tell you after his effort against Spurs in a Carabao Cup tie last month.\n\nNow 70, Panenka \u2013 who scored 17 goals in 59 appearances for Czechoslavakia \u2013 continues to keep a keen eye out for those who choose to take the risk of emulating his slight of foot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the idea continues and of course it makes me proud,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially when I see that even great stars like Sergio Ramos take the penalty like me.\u201d\n\nPenenka spent the majority of his career at Bohemians Praha before a switch to Rapid Vienna in 1981. Now, a display of skill like the one in Belgrade would have sent Premier League scouts into a state of frenzy. But back then, a move to English football would have been unthinkable.\n\nWhen I ask him if he could have played in the old First Division he laughs. \u201cNooooo,\u201d he says. \u201cEnglish football was not a fit for me. I like the technical way of play. Back in the day with Bohemians we played friendlies against English teams at least twice a year \u2013 and we never won.\u201d\n\nIt would be a surprise if England didn\u2019t hold the whip-hand in Prague again on Friday evening, with the Czech Republic a pale imitation of the once great Czechslovakian sides that routinely qualified for World Cups \u2013 finishing runners-up in 1934 and 1962 \u2013 and were one of the most feared teams in Europe.\n\nThe current Czech Republic side's 5-0 mauling at the hands of England at Wembley will still be fresh in their minds. Jaroslav Silhavy's side will also be acutely aware that Kosovo are breathing down their necks in the race for second place in Group A.\n\n\u201cIt won\u00b4t be easy for England, but they are still supposed to win this game \u2013 the Czechs can only surprise,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt will be harder in Prague of course and. I think there won\u00b4t be so many goals as at Wembley. If Czechs play well? Maybe it can be draw. We are in a position where we have nothing to lose.\n\n\u201cEngland are one of the strongest teams in Europe now. I like the player composition of this team. England was always combative force, but now I see a lot of finesse also.\u201d\n\nThe blood and thunder days that made Panenka unsuited to the English game are gone, replaced by something rather more elegant.\n\nLittle wonder the Czech maestro approves.", "description": "They were two penalties that shook the football world and, 43 years on from the Euro 1976 final, continue to do so.
