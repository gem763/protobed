According to the company's website, it will cost $89 per AirPod Pro for a replacement due to accidental damage. The same $89 price also applies to the AirPods Pro case should it need to be replaced out of warranty.\n\nThat's a $20 price increase compared to the standard AirPods, which cost $69 to replace out of warranty if they're not covered by Apple Care+. Replacing the wireless charging case would cost $69 as well, while the regular case is $10 cheaper to replace.\n\nIf you have Apple Care+, replacing any AirPod and any case due to accidental damage \u2014 whether it be the new Pro model or older versions \u2014 will cost just $29.\n\nShould you lose your AirPods, it will cost $89 to replace each AirPods Pro earbud and $99 for a new wireless charging case for the AirPods Pro. Standards AirPods will still cost $69 each to replace if they're lost, while a new regular case will cost $59 and the wireless charging case is priced at $79. Apple Care+ does not cover lost or stolen AirPods.\n\nIf your battery needs to be serviced and your AirPods are out of warranty or aren't covered by Apple Care+, you'll have to pay $49 per earbud and $49 for the case should they need battery service. That price applies to all models. Those with Apple Care+ will get free replacement coverage if the battery holds less than 80% of its original charge, Apple says.\n\nSince Apple launched its first pair of AirPods in 2016, there have been some concerns about how easy it would be to lose them should they slip out of your ear. Accessory makers have even created ear hooks and other add-ons designed to provide more peace of mind when wearing Apple's wireless earbuds.\n\nApple's AirPods Pro, however, come with silicon ear tips and are sweat and water resistant. This should provide a more secure grip for those having trouble and may make them more durable than Apple's standard AirPods \u2014 hopefully preventing the need to replace them at all.", "description": "Apple's new AirPods Pro will cost $20 more to replace compared to standard AirPods if they're out of warranty and aren't covered by Apple Care +.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db71de3dee0197f3f302454?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
