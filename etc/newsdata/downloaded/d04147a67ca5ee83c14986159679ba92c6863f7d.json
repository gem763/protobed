The league apologized to the oppressive Chinese government for Morey\u2019s support of the democracy activists.\n\nBut according to a recent report at Human Rights Watch, China is still one of the worst abusers of human rights in the world. In its 2018 report, the organization reported that China has \u201cdramatically stepped up repression and systematic abuses against the 13 million Turkic Muslims, including Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs, in China\u2019s northwestern Xinjiang region.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuthorities have carried out mass arbitrary detention, torture, and mistreatment of some of them in various detention facilities, and increasingly imposed pervasive controls on daily life,\u201d HRW wrote. \u201cNew regulations in Tibet now criminalize even traditional forms of social action, including community mediation by religious figures. In Hong Kong, a region promised \u2018a high degree of autonomy\u2019 under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments hastened their efforts in 2018 to undermine people\u2019s rights to free speech and political participation.\u201d\n\nHRW also reiterated China\u2019s oppression of its homosexual citizens, refugees, asylum seekers, women, and girls, and that is not to even mention its actions against Tibet.\n\nThis is the country that the NBA is falling all over itself to support.\n\nBut the woke members of the NBA has been very quick to attack Americans who they think aren\u2019t woke enough. Especially when they feel that they can safely attack such people without hurting their financial bottom line.\n\nFor instance, when NBA player Jason Collins came out as gay in 2013, the whole NBA was effusive in its praise of the player. Stars from Kobe Bryant to Kirk Gibson jumped to praise Collins for his bravery for coming out.\n\nIn another case, in 2016, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich \u2014 an outspoken leftist and critic of President Donald Trump \u2014 attacked the Trump administration for what Popovich insisted was Trump\u2019s \u201cbullying of gays and minorities.\u201d\n\nIt was right after Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, and Popovich was livid.\n\n\u201cNot basically because the Republicans won or anything, but the disgusting tenure and tone and all the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic,\u201d Popovich exploded. \u201cI live in that country where half the people ignored all that to elect someone. That\u2019s the scariest part of the whole thing to me.\u201d\n\nThen in 2017, Warriors coach Steve Kerr and his team hosted an \u201cLGBTQ Pride Night,\u201d to \u201ceducate kids\u201d about gay rights.\n\nBut according to the Lancet, China, home to one of the largest LGBTQ populations in the world, commits serious persecution and discrimination against gays. Not only does government take harsh action, Chinese society takes harsh action against gays. LGBTQ children even face serious oppression and abuse by parents, while Chinese authorities turn a blind eye.\n\nDespite China\u2019s abuse of its LGBTQ citizens, the woke NBA has been utterly silent about the mistreatment of gays in the country the league is courting for big dollars.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "The National Basketball Association considers itself one of the most \"progressive\" organizations in America, and is always ready to criticize", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Jae-C.-Hong-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
