However, they soon became friends and started dating after working in ABS-CBN's \"Los Bastardos\".\n\nVersoza also denied that Cuenca was the reason she ended things with businessman Michael Needham, saying that it just didn't work out between them.\n\nAs to whether the two of them have plans to get married, Cuenca said, Jake said, \"We're taking it a day at a time. But for me, for the first time in my life, I can see it in the horizon.\"\n\n\"Jake and I aren't the youngest of people. We're not teenagers anymore. We're two mature adults. We have our own careers. We're two adults living our own lives but we complete each other,\" said the former beauty queen.\n\n(Photo Source: Kylie Versoza Instagram)", "description": "The couple made their relationship official on \"Tonight with Boy Abunda\"", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vZLXSoVpFFIZYuiXlvzXCg--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_hive_asia_947/93d31ac0272edba96630553c9ebed58c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
