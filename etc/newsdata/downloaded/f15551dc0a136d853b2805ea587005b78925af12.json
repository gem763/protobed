Johnson is also expected to threaten MPs in his party with expulsion if they vote against the deal.\n\nHowever, without a further breakthrough in talks with the DUP on Thursday, European leaders are likely to open discussions later today on the subject of extending Britain's current Brexit deadline of October 31.", "description": "Boris Johnson's governing partners reject proposed Brexit deal with the EU as talks with the EU go to the wire.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da80ca7cc4a0a0cfe717042?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
