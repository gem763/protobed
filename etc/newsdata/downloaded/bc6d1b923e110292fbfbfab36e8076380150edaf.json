Considering the small sample size of any given freshman class\u2014which at many schools is just a few hundred students\u2014there\u2019s bound to be a good amount of random variation. Still, statistics from individual schools can serve as a window into each institution\u2019s idiosyncrasies.*\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology and New Orleans\u2019s Tulane University resemble each other in many ways. Both are elite schools that each year admit a tiny fraction of applicants and draw students from all over the country and the world. Yet MIT\u2019s freshmen tend toward conservative names that had fallen out of favor by the early Aughts, such as Anna and Kevin. Their peers at Tulane are more likely to have names that were trendy when they were born, such as William and Olivia.\n\nSuch distinctions point to the ways in which a college\u2019s most popular names can correlate with the characteristics of its student body. The top names for MIT\u2019s class of 2023 likely reflect the university\u2019s demographic breakdown. Four in 10 freshmen at the school identify as Asian American (another four in 10 as white); 16 percent of its students overall will be the first in their families to get a four-year degree. Meanwhile, many immigrant groups have tended, at least historically, to adopt \u201cAmerican-sounding\u201d (read: traditionally white) names.\n\nAt Tulane, Julia is the top name for its freshman women this year\u2014even though it wasn\u2019t that trendy in Louisiana, where the school is located, in 2001. Notably, Julia was all the rage at that time in Connecticut, where it was the second-most-popular girl name. This aberration, Wattenberg suggests, could be \u201cshorthand for the fact that among 2001 babies, the name skewed affluent, educated, and white.\u201d\n\nStudents\u2019 names can also reveal a school\u2019s character: My analysis of freshman-name data from close to 30 colleges and universities across the country shows that religious schools\u2019 most-popular lists often include biblical or religious names that were otherwise relatively unpopular in 2001, such as Grace and Stephen.\n\nRead: College-admissions hysteria is not the norm\n\nWhen choosing a name for their baby, parents these days tend to err on the side of standing out; that means the most popular baby names of yore were far more dominant at the time than the most popular ones are now. Back when Wattenberg attended Connecticut\u2019s Wesleyan College in the 1980s and early \u201990s, she says, a campus group held an annual \u201cJen and Dave\u201d party\u2014its admission exclusive to Jens and Daves. The names were so popular during that era that the parties were always a bona fide \u201cbash,\u201d Wattenberg recalls.\n\nThese days a \u201cJen and Dave\u201d party would almost certainly be a pathetic, if not altogether impossible, affair. At California\u2019s Soka University, for example, a single name appears more than once across the Buddhist liberal-arts school\u2019s roughly 110 freshmen, close to half of whom are from outside the U.S.\u2014there are two Harukas. The growing baby-name variation also makes any given college\u2019s most-popular list more sensitive to demographic and geographic differences. Take the name Logan: The 10th-most-popular boy name in the country last year, it was especially trendy in rural areas, according to Wattenberg. A couple of decades from now, the number of Logans at a college could signal the extent to which the college\u2019s students come from rural communities.\n\nNow that it\u2019s becoming more conventional for American parents to choose unconventional names, chances are colleges\u2019 individual freshman-name lists will veer further from the national rankings. \u201cWith greater name diversity,\u201d Wattenberg says, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing greater stratification.\u201d\n\n* This article has been updated to reflect that Soka University is a co-ed school.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
