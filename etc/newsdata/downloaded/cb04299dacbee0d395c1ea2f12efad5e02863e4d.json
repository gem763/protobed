While they currently hold Pick 4, there\u2019s no guarantee they take that to the draft given GWS (Pick 6) could be a club that considers a possible move up the order. Inside midfielder Tom Green could be a candidate for the Crows, given they have been known to bid on academy and father-son prospects in the past, if they rate them highly. Sam Flanders and Caleb Serong are two forward-half players who could appeal, along with zippy defender Lachlan Ash.\n\nBRISBANE LIONS\n\nDraft picks: 16, 21, 34, 48, 52, 55, 72\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: Lachlan Johnson, Noah Cumberland, Will Martyn, Keidan Coleman\n\nThe Lions\u2019 rapid rise up the ladder indicates they don\u2019t have too many pressing needs, but one area they may look to target is their finishing going inside 50. Victorian Miles Bergman had an excellent back-half of the season, despite battling shin splints during the year. Forward Cody Weightman could be in the mix at Pick 16, with the Vic Country player showing his class around goal.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDraft picks: 9, 43, 57, 70, 85\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: N/A\n\nFor the majority of trade period, it seemed the Blues would be without a first-round pick after Sydney\u2019s Tom Papley was tipped to walk through the door. But after the trade failed to happen, Carlton will use Pick 9 in the draft. A number of prospects are likely to available in a number of pressing spots. Ruckman Luke Jackson would be a strong candidate if not selected earlier, given Matthew Kreuzer\u2019s constant injuries. Versatile prospects Brodie Kemp and Josh Worrell may well appeal in a variety of positions, while it isn\u2019t out of the possibility dashing defender Lachlan Ash gets to Carlton\u2019s pick.\n\nBrodie Kemp didn\u2019t test at the national combine. Source: Getty Images\n\nCOLLINGWOOD\n\nDraft picks: 35, 62, 74\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: N/A\n\nThe Magpies won\u2019t be big players in the draft and may take as little as three selections in November. West Australians Elijah Taylor and Mitch Georgiades might come into their thoughts with their second-round selection. Taylor has scope to be one of the better prospects in the draft pool, while Georgiades missed the 2019 season due to quad injury. The tall could develop into a more than handy prospect for the Magpies through the VFL team. Harrison Jones may be another on the club\u2019s radar.\n\nESSENDON\n\nDraft picks: 31, 33, 61, 64, 65, 88\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: Lachlan Johnson, Mason Fletcher\n\nThe Bombers may have held onto Joe Daniher, but their forward line is still a work in progress. Calder Cannons prospect Harrison Jones doesn\u2019t appear ready to play senior football in 2020, but he is a prospect with scope for development over the coming years. The tall is a good mark overhead and has great mobility as a key target. Mitch Georgiades, Charlie Comben and Nick Bryan might be other talls Essendon consider at the pointy end of their draft board.\n\nFREMANTLE\n\nDraft picks: 7, 10, 22, 58, 69, 79, 83\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: Liam Henry, Isaiah Butters\n\nFremantle will be doing everything they can to ensure a bid on Liam Henry doesn\u2019t come before their juicy top-10 selections \u2013 and may do everything they can to try and get another pick before the next generation academy member receives a bid. Henry is a lively forward-half player who lit up Marvel Stadium with a fine performance in the Under 18 Championships in his flashy red boots. A knee injury at school football ended his season early, but there\u2019s no doubting he is capable of receiving a first round bid. Larke Medallist Deven Robertson appears their best bet for a top-10 selection, with the midfielder breaking Sam Walsh\u2019s record for the most disposals in a four-game Under 18 carnival.\n\nMiles Bergman is set to be a first-round pick.

Pick 14 seems too late for classy South Australian Dylan Stephens, meaning players like Cody Weightman, Miles Bergman and Will Day might be the next on their list. Day is the cousin of Gold Coast\u2019s Sam Day, with the raw defender impressing during the Under 18 Championships and at SANFL Level. Some recruiters have suggested he has scope to develop into a player similar to former Geelong player Andrew Mackie.\n\nGOLD COAST SUNS\n\nDraft picks: 1, 2, 15, 20, 78, 90\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: Malcolm Rosas, Connor Budarick\n\nYou can all but lock in Gold Coast\u2019s opening two selections as being Matt Rowell and Noah Anderson. The Vic Metro pair are very close friends and are crucial players for the future, as the Suns aim to move up the ladder. Rowell dominated 2019 and ended with a huge 44-disposal performance in the NAB League grand final, while Anderson is a tall, damaging and goalkicking midfielder who should slot into the AFL side for Round 1. Given the extra provisions handed to the club by the AFL, they will add Northern Territory livewire Malcolm Rosas and local Suns academy midfielder Connor Budarick to their list.\n\nGWS GIANTS\n\nDraft picks: 6, 40, 59, 60, 80, 94\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: Tom Green, James Peatling\n\nGWS has a Giant conundrum as the days tick down until the national draft. Do the Giants hold Pick 6 and hope a bid on Tom Green doesn\u2019t come? Or will they look to move higher in the draft order so they can draft another player then match a bid on Green? Of course, they could also overlook Green entirely. If the Patrick Cripps-like midfielder ends up at the Giants, it would be a huge boost to their on-ball brigade, given his dominance after averaging 31 disposals during the Under 18 Championships. Ruckman Luke Jackson has been linked with the club, but would they snap him up with a top-five selection? Lachlan Ash would add some speed on the outside, while Caleb Serong and Sam Flanders just get the job done.\n\nCaleb Serong had a strong season in the NAB League for Gippsland Power.

If Vic Metro MVP Fischer McAsey gets to Pick 11, he\u2019s the obvious candidate for a club that hasn\u2019t normally featured inside the first round in past years. McAsey is a strong overhead mark and showed off his versatility by going forward in the latter stages of 2019. McAsey\u2019s Sandringham Dragons teammate, Josh Worrell, is another player who would suit the need. The utility booted a number of goals for Vic Metro in the Under 18 Championships, but could end up as a tall wingman in the future. The Hawks appear likely to match a bid for father-son prospect Finn Maginness in the 15-25 range.\n\nMELBOURNE\n\nDraft picks: 3, 8, 97\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: N/A\n\nThe Dees have fielded offers for Pick 3 from GWS, but at this stage they appear likely to take it to the draft. Some rebound across half-back would appeal, especially the speed of Murray Bushrangers\u2019 Lachlan Ash. Ash loves to tuck the ball under his arm and spring down the wing, kicking it long off his right boot. Hayden Young is another rebounding defender who fits the bill, with his pinpoint left-foot kick providing a point of difference compared to other draft prospects. Cody Weightman and Luke Jackson are two other names who have been linked with Melbourne\u2019s other top-10 selection, while South Australian Dylan Stephens would give the Dees some poise off a wing.\n\nNORTH MELBOURNE\n\nDraft picks: 26, 27, 47, 50, 73, 84\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: N/A\n\nThe Roos traded out of the first round in order to secure another pick for 2020, meaning their first two selections are consecutive in Picks 26 and 27. If one of Trent Bianco, Will Day , Will Gould or Trent Rivers managed to slide through, North would have to consider their skills in the defensive half of the ground. Bianco ended the year on a high at NAB League level, while Day has plenty of scope for development. Rivers also has the ability to play in the midfield and could be a prime target given his flexibility. Sandringham Dragons utility Hugo Ralphsmith is another player the club could consider.\n\nCody Weightman celebrates a goal. Photo: Dylan Burns/AFL Photos via Getty Images.

Given their inside midfielder dominance, an outside midfielder in the class of SA prospect Dylan Stephens would be their No. 1 target \u2013 if he isn\u2019t taken earlier. The left-footer has poise and would be a great option for the club. If the Power look tall, Josh Worrell and Fischer McAsey might be two on their radar, while Miles Bergman\u2019s zip and rapid rise could see him snapped up in the second-half of the first round.\n\nRICHMOND\n\nDraft picks: 19, 38, 39, 41, 56, 75, 77, 95\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: N/A\n\nWhen you win the premiership, there isn\u2019t a major pressing need, but the club might look to the defensive half of the ground for a Bachar Houli replacement for the future. The speed of Miles Bergman across either flank would tick the box, with Will Day, Trent Bianco and Hugo Ralphsmith among the other players the club might focus in on. Bergman battled shin splints throughout the season but produced several big games at the pointy end of the season. The club will no doubt do their due-diligence on Cooper Stephens, who didn\u2019t played for majority of the year after a broken leg.\n\nST KILDA\n\nDraft picks: 51, 82, 100\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: Bigoa Nyuon\n\nThe Saints won\u2019t be major players and may as well not bother attending until the second night of the national draft. They could take as little as two selections on the night, with Pick 51 their first. A ruckman would be at the top of their priority list, with Oakleigh Chargers big man Nick Bryan a perfect fit, if he isn\u2019t snapped up earlier. The tall was linked as a potential top-20 pick earlier this year, given his mobility around the ground and craft in the ruck. The dash of Brisbane Lions academy prospect Noah Cumberland might mean St Kilda force their hand with a bid.\n\nLuke Jackson will be the first ruckman selected. Photo: Wayne Taylor.

GWS Academy prospect Tom Green is the obvious selection for the club to bid on, given Josh Kennedy would love a player to develop over coming seasons. Swans supporter Caleb Serong and fellow Gippsland Power teammate Sam Flanders could find roles in the attacking half of the ground, while versatile Brodie Kemp might be the next best fit after Green. The 191cm prospect wants to be a midfielder in the future, but suffered an ACL injury late in the season meaning he\u2019s unlikely to feature much in 2020.\n\nWEST COAST EAGLES\n\nDraft picks: 46, 91, 108\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: N/A\n\nTim Kelly was the Eagles\u2019 No. 1 priority over the off-season \u2014 and his arrival means the club won\u2019t enter the draft until Pick 46. Cooper Sharman\u2019s output in the NAB League was impressive for the Chargers, hardly missing a set-shot goal as the draft bolter earned an invite to the national combine. The former Giants academy member played senior football at Balwyn as scouts watched on, as he was coached by Rodney Eade. His mobility and marking ability will make him appeal to clubs outside the first round.\n\nWESTERN BULLDOGS\n\nDraft picks: 13, 53, 89\n\nDraftable Father-Son/Academy prospects: N/A\n\nThe Bulldogs were mighty firm on holding their first pick during trade period, indicating their desire to select a prospect in the second-half of the first round. It seems the forward-half of the ground is where their pressing needs, with Cody Weightman and Josh Worrell two such prospects. Weightman has great goal sense and x-factor around goal, with the lively prospect booting nine goals in four appearances for Vic Country. Worrell\u2019s shoulder injury kept him out of testing at the national combine, but his athletic traits have been on show in 2019 as he has played right across the ground, using his leap to effectiveness at either end.", "description": "The day are quickly ticking down until the 2019 national draft.", "authors": ["Matt Balmer", "Source", "Fox Sports"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/429429dcc83445eb2f45959d5ab366f0", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
