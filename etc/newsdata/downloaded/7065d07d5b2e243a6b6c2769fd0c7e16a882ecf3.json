Then I started speaking to people in the eastern suburbs and they were like, \u2018yeah, that\u2019d be great\u2019!\u201d\n\nThe workout incorporates tools from the farm, and Julia is hoping to create a \"mini community within a community\" in the city. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nFitness entrepreneur Mike Britton has founded several businesses, including outdoor boot camp Evolution to Wellbeing and an all-in-one fitness kettlebell device dubbed the YBell, and now runs a men\u2019s wellness and meditation program in Sydney. He says workouts are evolving to include more aspects of mindfulness, community and even broader social movements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re becoming increasingly isolated,\" he says. \"It\u2019s the same story \u2013 2000 Facebook friends but lacking real-life connections. And the thing I\u2019ve realised is that people aren\u2019t stupid, they know it. People want connection. They want that village feel. And fitness can offer that on some level.\"\n\n\"But this is where the industry needs to take responsibility and not manipulate that need, but actually offer that authentically,\u201d he says.\n\nIt can be a tricky brief to nail. IbisWorld fitness industry analyst Tom Youl wrote last year that although the mid-range fitness and gym market was hollowing out, consumers were diverging to either low-cost 24/7-style gyms or high-end options.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a code that Robyn Kelynack, who co-founded pole dancing studio Sydney Pole, has cracked. Sydney Pole began in 2013 with one studio and 15 weekly classes. Today she runs five studios and more than 500 classes a week, from barre to burlesque. Revenue has doubled every year since it began.\n\n\u201cWe're big on diversity. We created this business as a place where people could feel that they belonged,\u201d says Ms Kelynack.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who come in the door \u2013 they say initially they want to get fit, but the reasons they end up staying, and our ethos is, it\u2019s a place to belong. There is a strong community vibe, and people feel really empowered when they come in.\u201d\n\nPart of it is lucky timing: the mainstreaming of feminism led to an increased prominence of the idea of exercise as part of an \u201cempowerment\u201d narrative, rather than being about unattainable \"bikini bodies\".\n\nGoing to a Barry\u2019s workout is like hitting a nightclub, if clubbing were something people did sober at 6.15am and left them with an exercise high rather than a hangover.\n\nKelynack is also meticulous about getting feedback through informal conversations, regular online surveys and Facebook and Instagram polls that let students choose everything from merchandise designs to dances they want to learn.\n\nBut pole dancing doesn't fit with everyone's sense of identity. Others want a gym that matches their high-achieving, work-hard play-hard identity.\n\nEnter Barry\u2019s Bootcamp. In September 2018, the Fitness and Lifestyle Group, which also owns Fitness First, launched the US-founded Barry\u2019s into the Australian market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarry\u2019s is a challenger to incumbents F45 and CrossFit, both because of its high price point and its style of high-intensity interval training workout.\n\nGoing to a Barry\u2019s workout is like hitting a nightclub, if clubbing were something people did sober at 6.15am and left them with an exercise high rather than a hangover. The beats are intense. The energy soars high. The hashtag #BarrysBody is stamped on the facility\u2019s luxe mirrors, encouraging consumers to further identify with the brand and to share their workouts online.\n\nAt Barry's Bootcamp the vibe is nightclub without the drinks. Dan Hilburn\n\nOlivia Boyd-Smith, Barry\u2019s Asia Pacific marketing lead and a former intellectual property lawyer at Minter Ellison, says bringing Barry\u2019s to Australia involved both traditional marketing efforts and understanding what its target clients wanted.\n\nThe \"Barry's family\" is aspirational, she says, but there is also a strong sense of community for those who want it, supported by in-studio smoothie bars and monthly \"pop-up\" events.\n\nIn many ways, it's a formula long followed by churches, political parties and even exclusive private schools \u2013 if you can give someone a sense of belonging and even a stronger sense of self, the greater the chances that they will stick around.", "description": "Swinging sledgehammers at tyres might seem an unlikely way to tone up.
