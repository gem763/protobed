Amazon said it plans to spend about $1.5 billion more in the current quarter to get packages from its warehouses to its top customers in one day, rather than two. That\u2019s on top of massive spending to boost shipping speeds in the second and third quarters as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cost in the short run,\u201d Amazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky said during a conference call with journalists.\n\nThe payoff, Olsavsky said, will be worth it. Faster shipping will translate into high sales and more loyal customers. Still, the continued cost of speeding up delivery disappointed investors, who hammered the company\u2019s stock in after-hours trading.\n\n(Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nBecause of those additional costs, the company told investors to expect fourth-quarter operating income of $1.2 billion to $2.9 billion, compared with $3.8 billion a year ago.\n\nThe increased costs paid off in customers buying more items, Olsavsky said. \u201cWe see a lot of traction with customers,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThree months ago, Olsavsky noted that the company blew past plans to invest $800 million in the second quarter to speed up its shipping. At the time, he said the company also adjusted its third-quarter guidance to account for higher-than-anticipated costs.\n\nAD\n\nAmazon also noted it now has 750,000 full-time employees, up 22 percent from a year ago, another added cost.\n\nAmazon has endured periods of significant spending in its quarter-century as a company, a strategy that distinguished it from retail rivals that haven\u2019t dared run up such expenditures. In recent quarters, Amazon has been able to offset such lavish spending with gains from its lucrative cloud-computing and advertising businesses.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the cloud business, Amazon Web Services, continues to be the company\u2019s most profitable division, its growth and margins are slowing.\n\nOperating income at AWS, whose services are used to run technical infrastructure at companies including Unilever and Pinterest, jumped 9 percent from the same period a year ago to $2.3 billion. Sales rose 35 percent to $9 billion. Just three months ago, the unit\u2019s operating income climbed 29 percent as sales rose 37 percent.\n\nAmazon\u2019s digital advertising business, which sells space to big brands as well as merchants hawking wares on its retail site, posted big gains, too. In the period, Amazon\u2019s \u201cother\u201d category, which is primarily derived from advertising, grew 45 percent year over year to $3.6 billion.\n\nAD", "description": "The e-commerce giant's investments in delivering packages in one day as it ramps up for the holiday-shopping season continue to bit into its profit margins.", "authors": ["Jay Greene", "Reporter Focused On Technology Coverage In The Pacific Northwest"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0j4U64gCZxMCuGT_mrFmYJsxUTU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ER6LKJXKCII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
