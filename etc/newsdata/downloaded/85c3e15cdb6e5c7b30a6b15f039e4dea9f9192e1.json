Having Clarke around for two years will mean Treasury won\u2019t have to rush any of these negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarke even said he\u2019s willing to stay on as London-based adviser for longer, if chairman Paul Rayner and Ford want him.\n\nThe prickliness on the call came from Clarke\u2019s clear distaste for any suggestion that his regular sales of stock were a sign of a lack of confidence in the business.\n\nHe said he only ever sold shares to cover tax liabilities and said he wanted to provide \u201cair cover\u201d for Ford and other executives, who would likely have to sell shares in the future given Treasury\u2019s growth, and should not be subjected to the \u201cridiculous amount of repeated media coverage\u201d that has accompanied his sell downs.\n\nThe fall in Treasury\u2019s share price on Monday is, of course, reinforcement of how much investors love him.\n\nAnd given he\u2019s taken Treasury from basket case to market darling since arriving in March 2014 \u2013 and taking the share price from $3.50 to $17 over that period \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to understand the depth of feeling.\n\nWhile Clarke is a clear believer in the magic of wine \u2013 when Chanticleer sat down with him in Melbourne last week, he praised his wine makers as the company\u2019s real rock stars \u2013 his real legacy will be shifting Treasury away from the boom-and-bust mentality of a cyclical agricultural business and into the realms of a consumer brands business.\n\nBy shifting from the traditional industry model of owning huge numbers of vines to a model of leasing and contracting two-thirds of Treasury\u2019s grapes, Clarke has boosted Treasury\u2019s return on capital employed from 6.8 per cent to a sector-leading 14.9 per cent.\n\nBy planning the release of vintages over five years, and taking a multi-regional approach to wine-making \u2013 producing Penfolds-branded wines in California\u2019s Napa Valley and France, for example \u2013 Clarke has been able to tilt Treasury\u2019s portfolio towards luxury and so-called \u201cmasstige\u201d wines \u2013 anything above $10 a bottle. This has seen the group\u2019s EBIT margin double over the past five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy aggressively shifting in Asia, and China particularly, Clarke has boosted group EBIT from $225 million to $663 million between the 2015 and 2019 financial years.\n\nThe pace of change has been impressive and, as Clarke admitted on Monday, occasionally problematic; he said mistakes had been made around the leadership team, for example.\n\nBut Clarke will leave in 12 months with an impressive platform, and some big growth initiatives underway. The bar is set high for Ford.", "description": "Given Michael Clarke has taken Treasury from basket case to market darling since arriving in March 2014 \u2013 and taking the share price from $3.50 to $17 over that period \u2013 it\u2019s understandable how much investors love him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.773%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4223696675f28507dfd5ed2be9f3e4783d57eaa3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
