Thank you.\"\n\nMs Gilson explained how she is left living on the breadline despite spending 16 years caring for others in her role as a cardiac nurse.\n\nHer linkedin profile says she has worked for 11 years at the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs a number of high profile London hospitals.\n\nSarah said her take home pay a month is \u00a32,000 before she forks out \u00a3670 for rent, around \u00a3600 for childcare and \u00a3579 for travel.\n\nShe went on: \"My basic outgoings (rent, travel to work and childcare) are equal to my monthly wages.\n\n\"There is nothing left for bills and groceries, I have to work extra shifts to pay for these (if they're available.) I have posted proof of this you just need to scroll down.\"\n\n(Image: @Lillred/Twitter)\n\nShe now has 1,600 followers on Twitter and was trolled for asking for cash to be sent to her on PayPal.\n\nThe nurse apologised for her rash response to one troll and said being unable to support her daughter was troubling her.\n\n\"Every f****** day I live with the fact that I can't support my child. I should be able to, I work my ass off and I fail,\" she added.\n\nSarah also started a GoFundMe page in June to help support her autistic daughter Beth.\n\nShe wrote: \"I would love to take Beth on holiday after her SATs next year. I feel that having something positive to concentrate on would help keep her focused and take her mind off the stress of exams.\n\n\"As a nurse and single mother however, my funds are very limited and a friend suggested that I set up a GoFundMe campaign which people could donate to instead of giving birthday/Christmas presents.\n\n\"At first I was reluctant because I HATE asking for help but I now realise that asking for help when the reason is not about you is ok.\"", "description": "Sarah Gilson has resorted to setting up a GoFundMe page so she can carry on working as a cardiac nurse in London", "authors": ["Liam Mcinerney", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Sarah Gibson Facebook", "Lillred Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671744.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Sarah_Gibson_Nurse_Paypal_11_TRIANGLENEWSjpgs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
