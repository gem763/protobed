In a tweet he deleted soon after posting it, Morey wrote: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nMorey tried to walk back his comments in a series of follow-up tweets:\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nThose words, however, did not soften the communist nation\u2019s stance, as reports that the CBA was ending all business dealings with the Rockets began to percolate. While the Chinese have canceled the two G-League exhibition games involving the Rockets minor-league affiliates, two preseason games involving the Lakers and the Nets are still scheduled for later this week.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Communist China is making the NBA feel it wrath, after Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images-9-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
