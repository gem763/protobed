Unlike the iPhone's FaceID (and Google's earlier face-unlock system on Android 4.1), the Pixel 4's face unlock doesn't look for the user's eyes, so the phone could be pointed at a sleeping or unconscious owner and unlocked without their consent. This weekend, Google said in a statement that a fix \"will be delivered in a software update in the coming months.\"\n\nThe Pixel 4 was announced last week, and instead of including a fingerprint reader like most Android phones do, the Pixel 4 features Google's newly developed face-unlock system as the only biometric option. Google is clearly chasing the iPhone here, and the Pixel 4's face unlock works just like Apple's Face ID system: an IR dot projector blasts a grid of invisible dots onto the user's face, and a camera (a pair of cameras, in the case of the Pixel 4) reads the user's face in 3D.\n\nAs part of the many pre-release Pixel 4 leaks, screenshots of pre-release builds of the Pixel 4's software showed an option to \"require eyes to be open.\" So we know Google hasn't been completely blindsided by this problem; the fix just wasn't ready in time for launch. Here's Google's full statement on the issue:", "description": "Google says to use the \"lockdown\" feature to stop others from unlocking your phone.", "authors": ["Ron Amadeo"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pixel-4-7-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
