This was an acquihire, which means that they have acquired the employees of the company, to which they refer to as \u201cthe new Icelandic team.\u201d The team will be \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the development of Ripple\u2019s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) that, through Ripple\u2019s xRapid cross-border payment service, enables companies to transfer funds from a currency to XRP and then from XRP to a different currency.\n\nThe new Icelandic team, which describes itself as \u201cbig believers in XRP and the XRP Ledger,\u201d has more than two decades of experience in building trading platforms and foreign exchange trading algorithms. It has developed its crypto trading platform integrating over 30 markets in the last two years. However, Algrim was allegedly a victim of \u2018Big Bitcoin Heist\u2019 back in 2017, in which hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of mining equipment was stolen.\n\nIn the meantime, this is Ripple's \u201csecond engineering talent acquisition in one week,\u201d says the announcement, as just last week it announced the acquisition of Logos, a startup developing a turnkey payments solution focused on speed and scalability.

Observing the price since the beginning of this year, we see it gradually falling from its December 2018 high of USD 0.41, and though it has seen some smaller ups and downs, it didn\u2019t climb back up until the May-June period, when it reached the highest price of this year so far of USD 0.47 on June 23rd. It gradually declined since, seeing another smaller peek on September 18th with USD 0.31, dropping further afterwards. When it comes to the lowest price this year, just a few days ago it dropped to its December 2017 levels.", "description": "Ripple, a California-based crypto startup focusing on the banking sector, is continuing its acquisition program despite the price of their token, XRP , is down 29% this year.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/1d39388882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
