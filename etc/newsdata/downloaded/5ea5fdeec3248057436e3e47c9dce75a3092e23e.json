FILE PHOTO - A trader works at his post on the floor at the NYSE in New York\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell 0.3% percent when trading resumed on Sunday, a day after attacks on Saudi oil facilities that risk disrupting global energy supplies.\n\nSaturday's attacks knocked out more than half of Saudi oil output, or more than 5% of global supply.\n\ninitially fell 0.59%, but cut their losses and were last down 0.3%.\n\n\"I would expect a rough day for stocks tomorrow since this attack largely came out of the blue,\" said Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research. \"I\u2019m not overly concerned that it\u2019s more than a one-day move, though. We\u2019re not yet talking about a large-scale military intervention in the region.\"\n\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury note futures prices rose 0.2 pct at the start of trading.\n\n\"It is inconceivable that energy costs don't rise by some amount worldwide so the long nightmare of disinflation and below target inflation is over, and that's why the Treasury market is not going to have this flight-to-quality drop in yields,\" said David Kotok, chairman & chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors.", "description": "U.S. stock futures fall after Saudi oil attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8E0RR_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
