[Photo by GUO XU/FOR CHINA DAILY]\n\nChongqing, a metropolis surrounded by mountains and rivers in Southwest China, is said to have the best night views in the country.\n\nIn recent years, it has become a hot travel destination as many people are drawn by its delicious food and natural scenery.\n\nThanks to the upgrading of the city's landscape lighting system this year, evenings in Chongqing are glittering.\n\nThe traditional way to enjoy night views is to take the cruise ships to explore the Yangtze and Jialing rivers around the Yuzhong Peninsula. The cruises run from 7:30 pm to 10 pm, with each tour lasting about 45 minutes. Some ships also provide dinner and special cabins.\n\nOn a cruise, people can enjoy the views of Hongya Cave, bridges, the Opera House, futuristic-looking downtown Chongqing with its skyscrapers and Chaotianmen Port (literally the \"gate that faces heaven\").\n\nThe port is where the two rivers meet and Raffles City Chongqing sits. This distinctive complex of buildings was designed by architect Moshe Safdie in collaboration with more than 30 international consultants. It is designed to look like a great ship sailing down the waterway.\n\nIt is now a new landmark of Chongqing and will be the location of the world's highest infinity pool.\n\nIn addition to night tours on the rivers, the city is developing nightly bus tours for tourists.\n\nVisitors can go to the top of Nanshan Mountain and Erling Park to get a panoramic view of the Yuzhong Peninsula, or go to the Opera House on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and Yanyu Park on the south bank to look across the water, or even take the cable cars to enjoy the night view from above.\n\nOn Nanshan Mountain, visitors to Chongqing Night View Park can enjoy a 270-degree view of the two rivers and the Yuzhong Peninsula. The park features seven themed spots for taking photos, including huge nests, a kitchen and a heart-shaped house.", "description": "Chongqing, a metropolis surrounded by mountains and rivers in Southwest China, is said to have the best night views in the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d3900a310cf3e97a03728.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
