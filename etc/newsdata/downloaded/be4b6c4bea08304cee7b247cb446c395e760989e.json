Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n\u201cIf Dem party doesn\u2019t call for an investigation of Bidens\u2019 millions from Ukraine and billions from China, they will own it,\u201d tweeted Mr. Giuliani, who serves as President Trump\u2019s private lawyer.\n\nHe asked how President Obama allowed the Bidens to make \u201cbig money selling public office\u201d and whether the Democrats will continue to condone and enable \u201cthis kind pay-for-play?\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani also said that the \u201cBiden scandal\u201d was only beginning, noting the money the family made off China and Ukraine.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings came to light in whistleblower accusations of misconduct by Mr. Trump for allegedly pressuring the Ukraine president to investigate corruption involving the Bidens.\n\nMr. Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, has said he did nothing wrong and that he never discussed the business deals with his son.\n\nHunter Biden pocketed at least $3 million for a job on the board of a Ukraine gas company. He got the job while his father was vice president at 2014, at the height of tension over the Russian annexation of Crimea after seizing the territory from Ukraine.\n\nThe $3 million was wired to Hunter Biden through accounts in Cyprus and Latvia, according to reports that The Washington Times did not independently verify.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Biden visited Kiev as vice president and threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country\u2019s leaders fired Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor for alleged corruption. The prosecutor also was looking into the Ukraine gas company where Hunter Biden collected paychecks.\n\nThe Bidens also have been implicated in a billion-dollar deal in China.\n\nIn his book \u201cSecret Empire,\u201d Peter Schwizer described a trip Mr. Biden and Hunter Biden made to China in 2013 aboard Air Force Two. Less than two weeks later, Hunter Biden\u2019s law firm made a $1 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government\u2019s Bank of China. The deal later swelled to $1.5 billion, according to the book.\n\nThe president told reporters Monday that Mr. Biden\u2019s son exploited his father\u2019s position in government for years.\n\n\u201cHis son took money from Ukraine, his son took money from China,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the United Nations. \u201cA lot of money from China. China would love \u2014 nothing they\u2019d rather see than Biden get in. Because they would take this great [trade] deal that we\u2019re about to make and they would really have themselves a deal.\u201d\n\nThe president said he\u2019s the target of another \u201cDemocrat witch hunt\u201d with the whistleblower\u2019s complaint about his call with the president of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cHere we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with recession, they failed with everything, and now they\u2019re bringing this up,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe one who\u2019s got the problem is Biden. Biden did what they would like to have me do, except there\u2019s one problem: I didn\u2019t do it. What Biden did was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Dave Boyer contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
