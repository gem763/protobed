(Reuters)\n\nA Cabinet minister has said the government currently has \u201cno plan\u201d in place if Parliament chooses to stop the UK leaving the EU at the end of the month.\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said ministers are currently focused on doing \u201cabsolutely everything in our power\u201d to hit the October 31 deadline currently agreed with Brussels.\n\nMr Jenrick told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cBoris Johnson and this Government will do absolutely everything in our power to deliver Brexit on October 31.\n\n\u201cBut we have no plan as to what might happen if Parliament doesn\u2019t allow us to get Brexit done on October 31 because we intend to get it done on that date and that\u2019s the sole focus of this Government at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister has previously promised to deliver Brexit at the end of October with or without a deal. (Reuters) More\n\nIt came as Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said the Government wanted to get into \u201cintensive negotiations\u201d with Brussels \u2013 and confirmed that discussions were taking place with opposition MPs to win support for the PM\u2019s blueprint.\n\nMr Johnson meanwhile urged the EU to \u201cgrasp the opportunity\u201d his plan provides but insisted Britain will pack its bags and walk out on October 31 \u2013 even if Europe does not \u201ccheerily wave us off\u201d with a deal.\n\nMr Barclay appeared to confirm that the Government would send a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit delay if a deal has not been agreed by October 19 \u2013 after Government lawyers told Scotland\u2019s highest civil court that Mr Johnson accepted the commitment.\n\nPressed on the pledge, Mr Barclay told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cIf a commitment is given to the court, you abide by it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE FROM YAHOO NEWS UK:\n\nHe also said the Government had been \u201ctalking to Members of Parliament across the House because I think many Members of Parliament want to avoid no-deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd particularly those Members of Parliament in Leave constituencies who have voted against no-deal and voted against a deal three times, then they will need to be able to address this issue when they return to their electorate,\u201d he added.\n\nDescribing his blueprint for an agreement as a \u201cpractical compromise that gives ground where necessary\u201d, Mr Johnson said it represents the UK \u201cjumping to the island in the middle of the river\u201d.\n\nWriting in the Sun on Sunday, he added: \u201cIf we\u2019re to leave with a deal, we now need the EU to jump over from its side and join us there, showing its own willingness to do a deal that the UK Parliament can support.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson urged Brussels to \u201cgrasp the opportunity\u201d his new Brexit proposal provides, as he repeated his vow not to delay the UK\u2019s departure.\n\nThe Prime Minister insisted Britain will pack its bags and walk out on October 31, but said it remains to be seen whether Europe will \u201ccheerily wave us off\u201d with a deal.\n\nBut the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier poured scorn on the chances of the new proposal succeeding, reportedly telling an event in Paris: \u201cIf they do not change, I do not believe, on the basis of the mandate I have been given by the EU27, that we can advance.\u201d\n\nIn comments reported by The Observer, he also reiterated the EU\u2019s claim that a no-deal outcome would \u201cnever be Europe\u2019s choice\u2026 it would always be the UK\u2019s choice, not ours\u201d.\n\nDespite Mr Bariner\u2019s gloominess, the European Commission said on Friday this week that EU member states agree the proposals \u201cdo not provide a basis for concluding an agreement\u201d.\n\nA spokesman said discussions between the two sides would not take place this weekend, as had been anticipated, and instead the UK will be given \u201canother opportunity to present its proposals in detail\u201d on Monday.\n\n---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK---", "description": "Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the government \"intends to get Brexit done\" on October 31.", "authors": ["George Martin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qxuhn9vRmmEySES.3Eztjg--~B/aD0yMjg2O3c9MzY1NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/20d542c0-e847-11e9-afbd-569554fb4b04", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
