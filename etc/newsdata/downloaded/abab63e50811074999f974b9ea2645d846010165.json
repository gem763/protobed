Questioning the repatriation costs seems a very clear signal that it does not believe the choice is as straightforward as \u00a3200m this weekend or \u00a3600m next week.\n\nSecondly, government sources point out that the UK was the country that pushed hardest within the EU for the imposition of state aid rules to be enforced after many years of EU governments rescuing sensitive industries like airlines and car makers. The government's previous refusal to offer assistance to companies like Carillion would make a U-turn on this approach very difficult in principle and in practice.\n\nAlthough the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October, any new relationship is yet to be determined and issues such as respective rules on state aid will be part of that discussion. The EU in particular is keen to preserve a \"level playing field\" when it comes to European competition.\n\nThe matter is being handled by the Department for Transport rather than Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. This was department organised the repatriation of customers of the failed airline Monarch.\n\nIn the past, the government has supported businesses through loan guarantees but its not thought that will be enough to convince lenders to back the company's restructuring.\n\nWhat is needed is additional equity capital - in other words - money that does not have a repayment schedule - unlike a loan.\n\nA private sector deal may still be possible but the noises coming out of the government at the moment suggest that the UK taxpayer is unlikely to become Thomas Cook's saviour.", "description": "Business editor Simon Jack says the crisis-hit British travel giant cannot rely on aid from Whitehall.", "authors": ["Simon Jack", "Business Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10783/production/_108895476_8c6a51a1-7991-4334-9459-f8779e4e9935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
