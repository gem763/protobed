There was no clear effect for fish-eaters.\n\nOverall, the findings showed that over a 10-year period, there would be 10 fewer cases of coronary heart disease in vegans and vegetarians than in meat eaters per 1,000 people, but three more cases of stroke.\n\nThe team said the increased risk of stroke could be down to lower levels of vitamins among the vegetarians and vegans in the study.\n\n\u201cWe observed lower rates of ischaemic heart disease in fish eaters and vegetarians than in meat eaters, which appears to be at least partly due to lower body mass index and lower rates of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes associated with these diets,\u201d the researchers explained.\n\nThe team acknowledged that the study, which was published in the British Medical Journal, had limitations, including the fact that it is based on self-reporting and mainly involved white people living in the UK.\n\nTracy Parker, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201dThis study provides further evidence that eating more plant-based foods can help lower our risk of heart disease.\n\n\u201cHowever, it also found that vegetarians, including vegans, are at a higher risk of stroke than meat eaters - potentially due to lack of certain nutrients.\n\n\"Whilst this is an interesting finding, this study is observational and doesn't provide us with enough evidence, so more research in this area would be needed.\u201d\n\nParker explained that one way people can reduce their risk of heart and circulatory diseases is to ensure they are eating a balanced diet, packed with plenty of fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds.\n\n\u201cFor those who do eat meat, cutting back to less than 90g of red or processed meat a day is advised,\u201d she added.", "description": "Vegans and vegetarians have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than meat-eaters but a greater risk of having a stroke, researchers have found.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/18/15/istock-855098134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
