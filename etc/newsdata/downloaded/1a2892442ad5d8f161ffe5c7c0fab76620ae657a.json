Right: Annemiek van Vleuten wins the women\u2019s elite road race\n\nNearly 2 million spectators turned out to watch the 2019 Tour de Yorkshire and 4 million fans visited the county to support the Tour de France Grand D\u00e9part in 2014, among the largest crowds ever for cycling events in the UK.\n\nWomen\u2019s elite road race\n\nThe peloton climbs Parliament Hill, in Harrogate\n\nSpectators urge on the riders on Norwood Edge hill climb\n\nAnnemiek van Vleuten crosses the line\n\nThe peloton rolled out to the north of Bradford before the first categorised ascent on Norwood Edge, a winding ramp which distanced some of the weaker climbers. A final undulating approach into Harrogate and two laps of the city circuit proved a war of attrition before Annemiek van Vleuten won the world champion title\n\nTeam time trial mixed relay\n\nMembers of the Dutch team celebrate their victory\n\nThe Belgium rider Frederik Frison (left) and the British competitor John Archibald warm up\n\nFans in Harrogate cheer on competitors in the inaugural UCI mixed relay race\n\nMembers of the Italian team at the finish line\n\nExhausted German riders\n\nYorkshire hosted the first ever team time trial mixed relay, with national teams consisting of three male and three female riders. The men set off first and the women replaced them on the road as soon as the second male rider crossed the finish line. Final timings were taken when the second female rider crossed the line.\n\nAlex Brooke-Turner (centre), the winner of the men\u2019s MH4 para-cycling road race\n\nLeft: Fans line the route. Right: Dame Sarah Storey, who took the women\u2019s world title.\n\nBritish rider David Stone (centre) at the finish line\n\nIt was the first UCI-sanctioned international para-cycling event to take place alongside the UCI road world championships and was used as a qualifier for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.\n\nMen\u2019s elite individual time trial\n\nNils Politt of Germany\n\nClockwise from top left: R\u00fanar \u00d6rn \u00c1g\u00fastsson (Iceland), Ryan Mullen (Ireland), J\u00e1n Andrej Cully (Slovakia), Luke Durbridge (Australia)\n\nThe route headed in a south-westerly direction out of Northallerton, followed by a short, sharp ascent on the outskirts of Masham. After a fast section into Risplith, there was barely a flat metre of road. The riders had to keep something in reserve before one last blast into Harrogate and up to the finish line on Parliament Street.\n\nMen\u2019s elite road race\n\nThe distinctive gold helmet and bike of Belgium\u2019s Greg Van Avermaet\n\nFans cheer on their riders in the mens elite road race\n\nRelentless rain resulted in organisers shortening the men\u2019s road race from 281km to 261km (162 miles)\n\nThe Danish rider Mads Pedersen took the gold after more than six sodden hours in the saddle\n\nMads Pedersen became Denmark\u2019s first road world champion. \u201cWhen I saw the finish line I hoped the pain would be gone and I could do a good sprint. After six-and-a-half hours on the bike there is not much left. You have to be focused and stay in front. Don\u2019t get any bad luck. It\u2019s every rider\u2019s dream to wear that jersey. For me to do it now is unbelievable.\u201d", "description": "The UCI road world championships took place in the Yorkshire dales amid relentless rain", "authors": ["Gary Calton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0edac656e5950816567c52723a3dfa0d741d0f1/627_145_6093_3656/master/6093.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=753576f96419ff49708c3668c7d0cef5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
