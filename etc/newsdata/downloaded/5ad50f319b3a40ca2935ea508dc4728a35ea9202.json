The two met for the first time since Kono assumed his post in a Cabinet reshuffle last month.\n\nKono also appreciated Schneider's efforts to realize the revision in July of the Guidelines Regarding Off-Base U.S. Military Aircraft Accidents, which allowed early entry by Japanese police, fire and rescue service personnel to crash sites.\n\nBefore the revision, the U.S. forces had often kept Japanese authorities away from accident sites in the early stages of investigation. Such cases included the 2004 crash of a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter into a university campus in Gionwan, Okinawa Prefecture.\n\nAfter taking office, Kono has held talks with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper over the phone and also met with some U.S. military leaders including Lt Gen Stacy Clardy, commander of the III Marine Expeditionary Force and head of U.S. forces in Okinawa.\n\nSchneider, who doubles as commander of Fifth Air Force headquartered at the Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo, took up his position in February.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Defense Minister Taro Kono agreed with the commander of U.S. forces in Japan on Monday to beef up bilateral cooperation in dealing with North Korea's missile development.
