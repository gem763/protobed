They fight at home and we get the money.\"\n\nMagufuli, known for his sometimes abrupt and controversial statements, has earned some international respect by fighting internal corruption but global donors have raised concerns about human rights abuses.\n\n* Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER\n\nFOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nCritics say Magufuli has unleashed a wave of oppression since his election in 2015, cracking down on opposition figures, the media and gays.\n\nThe European Union, Tanzania's biggest development partner, and the World Bank recently took measures to sanction repressive policies by Magufuli's government.\n\nAfter his comments in front of ministers and WFP representatives led to some snickers and giggles, the president tried to qualify his words: \"I do not say that I wish they fight, but if they fight, that their conflict is a source of profit for us.\"\n\n\"Because even if we do not give them food, they will fight. We do not want them to fight, but if they fight, let's take advantage of it,\" he clarified.\n\nMagufuli called on the agriculture ministry and other services to seize possible business opportunities.\n\n\"The market is there: if the WFP even asks for 200 000 tons, hurry up and buy from producers and give to the WFP,\" he said.\n\nTanzania sold 31 000 tons of maize to the WFP in 2018, according to the agriculture ministry.", "description": "Tanzanian President John Magufuli on Friday urged his ministers to \"take advantage\" of refugee crises and make money by selling food to international aid organisations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7935/2b1fb04657754b54a0d2908b20efbb5a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-05"}
