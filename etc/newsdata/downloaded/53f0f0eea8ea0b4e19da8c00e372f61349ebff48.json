If they are lucky, they are taken in by people who not only give them a home, but love and support too.\n\nAs teens in New York City's foster care system, Ro, Sha, Gregory and Dior were placed in several homes before finding a place to call home.\n\nAnd it was all thanks to one man named Guy Bryant.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cGuy basically opened his doors for me when I needed it most,\u201d said Gregory, one of Guy Bryant\u2019s foster sons.\n\nFor 12 years, Guy Bryant has been fostering teens in Brooklyn, New York, and he's gone above and beyond to help kids who need homes.\n\n\"I've seen the worse, I've seen kids that come in and they've had no place to live,\" Guy told \"Good Morning America\" Friday. \"I had a good home. I lived well and my family, we were a family and I think everybody should have family.\"\n\nBryant started opening his doors to teens while he was working for the city's Administration for Children\u2019s Services, and realized that older kids in the foster care system were the hardest to place in homes.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants the babies. They\u2019re cute. They\u2019re cuddly,\u201d said Guy, who is currently a foster parent to Ro, Sha, Gregory and Dior.\n\nABC\n\nIn the U.S. there are nearly 450,000 children in foster care. Of those kids, there are over 100,000 who are teenagers in need of homes.\n\n\u201cThey go from place to place, so they\u2019re raised by a whole bunch of different people and they have a whole bunch of different values,\u201d said Guy. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want the problems with somebody who is that age.\u201d\n\nShallah Dawson said he had trouble with the way rules were structured at some of his previous foster homes before moving in with Guy. \\\n\nABCNews.com\n\n\u201cI was in homes where the fridge was locked. I couldn\u2019t eat when I wanted to,\u201d he said.\n\nNow simple things in Guy\u2019s home like the kitchen is something that Sha is most grateful for.\n\n\u201cHere we have our own space and we can create our own type of family,\u201d he said.\n\nLike Shallah, Gregory bounced from foster home to foster home before he met Guy. He says Guy gave him hope and made him feel like he belonged in his home.\n\nCourtesy Guy Bryant\n\nNow, Gregory is enrolled in college and says it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Guy.\n\n\u201cMeeting Guy was like, \u2018Alright, there is someone out there -- there\u2019s still more to gain than to just shut the world off,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the past 12 years, Guy has been a foster parent to more than 50 teens. And he\u2019s given each and every one of them unconditional love and support.\n\nCourtesy Guy Bryant\n\n\u201cThey know I love them, I tell them all the time,\u201d Guy told \u201cGMA.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important because some of them have never heard that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a strong relationship,\u201d said Guy\u2019s foster son, Romario \u201cRo\u201d Bassell. \u201cI see everything he does is out of love.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nAnd many of Guy\u2019s former foster kids agree.\n\nOn \u201cGMA,\u201d several of Guy\u2019s former foster kids surprised him to say thank you.\n\nThe experience of being a parent to so many foster kids has been humbling for Guy, who says he feels like he just simply filled a need in the system -- something that anyone can fill if they do it the right way.\n\n\u201cYou never know what you have to offer until that child comes into your home,\u201d Guy said.", "description": "Guy Bryant has been a foster parent for twelve years to more than 50 teens -- and now many of them are reaching out to tell him thank you.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/foster-family-abc-ml-191004_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
