(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHow much is the average American kid's allowance? Enough to snag the latest iPhone after a few months of socking away dollars and dimes.\n\nParents typically give their kids $30 a week, according to a new survey from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants that was conducted by the Harris Poll.\n\nFifty-two percent of Americans say chores should be required: The kids should have to take out the trash, wash the dishes or fulfill other household tasks to earn their spending money.\n\nEighty percent of mothers and fathers who give their children an allowance say they expect them to spend at least an hour a week on chores.\n\nThose who have to work for their allowance tend to reap more, earning $6.11 an hour on average, a 38% jump from the typical $4.43 kids saw in 2016.\n\nHowever much they earn, kids aren\u2019t keen on saving, spending 45% of their allowance on hanging out with buddies and 37% on digital devices or downloads.\n\nAll that splurging shows that kids may be missing a key lesson receiving an allowance should teach \u2013 how to handle money.\n\nFor GM strike, no end in sight: GM-UAW talks hit big snag; settlement not near\n\nMcRib is on the menu: McDonald's McRib is back for a limited time. How to find it\n\n\u201cSimply handing money over to a child without guidance is a missed opportunity,\" Gregory Anton, chair of the AICPA\u2019s National CPA Financial Literacy Commission, said in a statement announcing the survey's results. \u201cBy making an allowance a teachable moment, parents will help instill money management skills in their child at a young age that will help prepare them for the important financial decisions they\u2019ll have to make when they\u2019re older.\"\n\nThough more than nine in 10 parents say it is very important for their children to know how to make smart decisions about their money, 32% give their kids financial lessons once a month or less, and 7% of them have never given their children tips about money.\n\nHere are a few goals the commission says parents should keep in mind:\n\nCLOSE You would think people with $1 million would be set for life. Most would disagree. USA TODAY\n\nBegin when the kids are young\n\n\u201cGive them small jobs to earn their own money to pay for toys or other wants and help them to see their efforts grow with a chart on the fridge, showing the progress they are making towards their goal,\" Jaleigh White, a certified public accountant and member of the commission, said in the statement.\n\nTell kids money comes with strings\n\nWhether their weekly payout is linked to household tasks or they're offered ways to boost their allowance, \u201cmake sure your children understand why they are getting it, how they can earn it and how they can lose it,\" said CPA and commission member Matthew Rosenberg.\n\nTeach kids to do the math\n\nIf they want to go to a concert or buy a device, show your child how to figure how much they need to regularly save to make that purchase. Kids can be encouraged to divide their money between immediate wants, such as going to a movie with friends, and longer-term goals, such as saving for college. Consider mimicking the dollar match many employers offer employees who contribute to their 401(k) savings plan, similarly matching whatever your child manages to save.\n\nFollow Charisse Jones on Twitter @charissejones\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/07/allowance-kids-make-average-30-week-but-what-lessons-learned/3897352002/", "description": "Parents are typically giving their kids $30 a week,\u00a0according to a new survey from the\u00a0 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants", "authors": ["Charisse Jones", "Published A.M.
