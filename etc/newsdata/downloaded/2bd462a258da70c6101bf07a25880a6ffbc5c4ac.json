REUTERS/Stringer NO ARCHIVES. NO RESALES.\n\nLUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Heavy rains have killed at least 113 people in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states over the past three days, officials said on Monday, as flood waters swamped a major city, inundated hospital wards and forced the evacuation of inmates from a jail.\n\nIndia\u2019s monsoon season that begins in June usually starts to retreat by early September, but heavy rains have continued across parts of the country this year, triggering floods.\n\nAn official said that at least 93 people had died in most populous Uttar Pradesh since Friday after its eastern areas were lashed by intense monsoon showers.\n\nRising water levels forced authorities to shift 900 inmates from a prison in eastern Ballia district, police officer Santosh Verma said.\n\nIn neighboring Bihar, an impoverished agrarian region that was hit by floods earlier this year, the death toll from the latest bout of rain had reached 20 on Monday, a state government official said.\n\nBihar\u2019s capital city of Patna, home to around 2 million, has been badly hit, with waist-deep flood waters across many streets, and entering homes, shops, and even the wards of a major hospital. In some parts, authorities deployed boats to rescue residents.\n\n\u201cThe rains have stopped but there is waterlogging in many areas,\u201d Bihar\u2019s Additional Secretary in the Disaster Relief Department Amod Kumar Sharan said.\n\nIn its bulletin on Monday, India\u2019s Meteorological Department said the intensity of rainfall over Bihar was very likely to reduce. Showers in Uttar Pradesh are also expected to abate this week.\n\nWeather department officials said this month that monsoon rains were likely to be above average for the first time in six years.
