This summer it looked improbable that his Landry\u2019s Inc. restaurant group would get a shot. Private equity firm L Catterton had struck a deal to acquire the high-end chain in June and, as recently as Tuesday, bankers were busy trying to sell debt to fund the transaction.\n\nBut, in a surprise twist, Fertitta popped up to snare the coveted steakhouses.\n\nL Catterton completed its $650 million purchase Wednesday, but immediately announced it was selling Del Frisco\u2019s Double Eagle Steakhouses and Del Frisco\u2019s Grilles to Landry\u2019s for an undisclosed sum. The buyout firm will keep bartaco, a purveyor of tacos and tequila, and Barcelona Wine Bar brands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve looked at for years and sometimes you just have to wait for the deal to come back to you,\u201d Fertitta, 62, said in a phone interview.\n\nDel Frisco\u2019s operates more than 35 restaurants, including Del Frisco\u2019s Double Eagle in Midtown Manhattan, a favorite with the finance crowd, offering its signature 45-day dry-aged double-bone prime ribeye for $140 and a tasting of three wagyu steaks at $205.\n\nIt also has locations in Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston, and one in Washington that caters to lobbyists and politicians. On the night of the deal, a sign indicated that Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was there.\n\nDespite the chain\u2019s popularity with Wall Street, bankers labored to sell $425 million of debt to fund L Catterton\u2019s buyout. Credit Suisse Group AG offered an all-in yield of 9.6%, people familiar with the matter said this month. But with concerns growing about the effects a potential recession may have on a cyclical business, especially expensive steakhouses and wine bars, some investors remained skeptical.\n\nA spokeswoman for L Catterton declined to comment.\n\nFertitta, who\u2019s worth $3.9 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, also said he couldn\u2019t comment on why L Catterton sold the assets, but he\u2019s a big believer in steak.\n\nThe Houston businessman already owns nine steakhouse chains, including Morton\u2019s and Mastro\u2019s. He even opened a female-focused one with actress Eva Longoria in 2013 that\u2019s now closed. Fertitta said he\u2019s willing to put more equity into the Del Frisco\u2019s business and isn\u2019t concerned about the long-term prospects, including the threat from meat substitutes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I need to do,\u201d said Fertitta, who\u2019s also the chairman and chief executive officer of Fertitta Entertainment, which operates the Golden Nugget casinos. \u201cSteak\u2019s always gonna be the most popular food in the world.\u201d\n\nFertitta, who counts Jefferies Financial Group Inc. head Richard Handler as a close friend, used the bank as Landry\u2019s lead adviser on the deal, along with Deutsche Bank Securities and North Point Advisors.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Austin Weinstein in Washington at aweinstein18@bloomberg.net;Sally Bakewell in New York at sbakewell1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Peter Eichenbaum, David Scheer\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Tilman Fertitta had to wait to land his prize.The billionaire owner of casinos, restaurants and the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets had coveted Del Frisco\u2019s Restaurant Group Inc. since 2012.
