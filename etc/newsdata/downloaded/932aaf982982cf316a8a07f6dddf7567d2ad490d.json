The source suggested it is best for both sides to move on following a confrontation like the one between Marrone and Ramsey.\n\nRamsey has talked about playing elsewhere in the past (warning: NSFW language):\n\nAccording to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Ramsey's frustration with the Jaguars \"has been steadily building\" and can be traced back to more than just the confrontation during Sunday's loss.\n\nHe prefers to play in man coverage and has grown annoyed with Jacksonville using him in zone.\n\nRamsey's talent was on display during the game against the Texans when he was matched up with DeAndre Hopkins, one of the NFL's best receivers. Hopkins managed only five catches for 40 yards, while Ramsey tallied four tackles and a pass breakup.\n\nMarrone said he has not discussed the altercation with Ramsey since the game and doesn't believe he needs to in the future, according to Charean Williams of Pro Football Talk.\n\nAny team that traded for Ramsey would immediately bolster its defense. The 24-year-old is under contract through the 2020 season, and he can defend the opponent's No. 1 option on a weekly basis.\n\nRamsey is a two-time Pro Bowler and was a first-team All-Pro in 2017 when he helped lead the Jaguars to the AFC Championship Game.", "description": "Jacksonville Jaguars  cornerback Jalen Ramsey reportedly asked for a trade following Sunday's 13-12 loss to the  Houston Texans , which featured an altercation between the Florida State product and head coach  Doug Marrone ...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/457/hi-res-44a6c2f506f4ef13a2ae9fdb3354eb7d_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
