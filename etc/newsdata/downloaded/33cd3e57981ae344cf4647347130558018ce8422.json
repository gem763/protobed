And despite Fed officials\u2019 intentions, those consequences, including a radical change in the Fed\u2019s methods of monetary control, have mostly been regrettable. While Fed officials hoped that the new floor system would assist them in regulating the flow of private credit in the face of extremely low and falling interest rates, a close look at the workings of the system, and at its record, shows that those hopes have been disappointed.\n\nAs the following pages will show, among its other consequences the Fed\u2019s new operating system\n\nintensified an already severe economic downturn by serving as the means by which the Fed maintained an excessively tight monetary policy;\n\nled to a sustained collapse in the interbank market for federal funds, thereby destroying the Fed\u2019s traditional means of monetary control;\n\ndramatically reduced the effectiveness of open-market operations, so that even massive Fed asset purchases might not supply the stimulus to investment and spending that much smaller purchases would once have achieved;\n\nundermined productivity by substantially increasing the Fed\u2019s role in allocating scarce credit; and\n\nmade it more difficult for the Fed to reach its 2 percent inflation target.\n\nAlthough the FOMC announced in 2015 that it would \u201cbegin an extended effort to evaluate potential long-run monetary policy implementation frameworks\u201d which was \u201cexpected to run through the end of 2016\u201d (Board of Governors 2015), if it has reached any conclusions based on that effort, it has yet to announce them. And despite having finally embarked upon a program of monetary policy \u201cnormalization,\u201d involving the gradual lifting of its policy rates and a reduction in the size of its balance sheet, many top Fed officials appear to be strongly inclined to make the floor system permanent.\n\nThose officials claim, nevertheless, to be willing to entertain the possibility of switching from that system to a more conventional \u201ccorridor\u201d-type system in the future. This book\u2019s purpose is to encourage them in that direction, while also making others aware of the present system\u2019s shortcomings. It will explain in detail how the Fed\u2019s floor-system experiment came about, what its intended and actual consequences have been, and why either the Fed itself or Congress should bring the experiment to an end as rapidly as can be done without causing further economic damage.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/pubs/covers/working-paper-50-cover-3.gif?itok=4hadq6yO", "published_at": "2018-11-15"}
