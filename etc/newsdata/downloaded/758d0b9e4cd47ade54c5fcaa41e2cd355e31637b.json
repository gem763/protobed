They met back in 2014 at a luxury Italian boutique hotel Alejandra bought with her former husband and was managing at the time.", "description": "In August, the actor, 70, boarded an Open Arms rescue ship off Lampedusa island to deliver food supplies to the nearly 150 migrants on board, after their vessel was allowed to enter Italian waters.", "authors": ["Ryan Smith For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/01/19718042-0-image-a-64_1571100330461.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
