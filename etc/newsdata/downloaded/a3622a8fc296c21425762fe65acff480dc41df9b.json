Thunberg, who tweeted pictures from the march, was scheduled to address the gathering.\n\nThree million people had participated worldwide as of midday in New York, organizers with the anti-fossil fuels group 350 said. Britain\u2019s opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that 100,000 people joined the demonstration in London.\n\n\u201cThis is about my future, not only my future, but the future of my entire generation and all the generations to come after ours,\u201d said Tristan Vancleef, 16, among some 15,000 demonstrators who marched through central Brussels.\n\nMore than 200 young people in Thailand stormed into the environment ministry and dropped to the ground feigning death as they demanded government action, while students in New Delhi staged a similar \u201cdie-in.\u201d\n\nActivists in Berlin and Munich re-enacted gallows, standing on melting blocks of ice with nooses around their necks to symbolize the death that awaits them when the polar ice caps melt. Others in Warsaw staged a performance of people drowning in a sea of plastic waste.\n\nWhile Europeans filled the streets, students in the Solomon Islands gathered at the rising ocean water\u2019s edge wearing traditional grass skirts. The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.\n\nStudents hold placards as they take part in the Fridays for Future climate change action protest in Paris, France, September 20, 2019.
