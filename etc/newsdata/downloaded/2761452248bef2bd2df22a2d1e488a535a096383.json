Which is a good reminder for us all to be more grateful for the neighbor who beat the shit out of Rand Paul. \u2014 Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) October 24, 2019\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Paul appeared on ABC News\u2019 Powerhouse Politics podcast and said the Kurds are acting like \u201cingrates\u201d toward U.S. troops withdrawing from northern Syria by throwing potatoes at them.\n\n\u201cWe saved the Kurds from being beheaded and massacred by ISIS,\u201d Sen. Paul said. \u201cThey were able to win with our armament, with our Air Force, and they should be thanking us and throwing rose petals. And so, no, I\u2019m offended by them throwing refuse at our troops. And it shows them to be ingrates.\u201d\n\nMidler\u2019s Wednesday tweet is far from the first instance in which she\u2019s endorsed physical violence against a Republican.\n\nMidler faced blowback in June over a deleted tweet in which she fantasized about President Trump being stabbed to death. Last year, the Hollywood leftist said she hoped to watch the president\u2019s funeral on television and expressed her desire to see him and his entire family hanged.\n\nIn September, she said that she hoped a \u201cbee hive\u201d would harm President Donald Trump, and fantasized about singer Beyonce beating the president in 2020.\n\n\u201c#Beyonc\u00e9 has 133 million Instagram followers. More than double the people who voted for Trump. Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if the #BeyHive mobilized to defeat him? I also wouldn\u2019t mind if a regular bee hive fucked his shit up,\u201d Midler said.", "description": "Left-wing actress and singer\u00a0Bette Midler on Wednesday lashed out at Sen.
