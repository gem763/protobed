The fast-paced session with callers goes quickly. Monday night one caller asked about B&G Foods ( BGS ) : \"It had a bad quarter. I can't say I like them anymore,\" was Cramer's response.\n\nLet's take a look at the charts to round out the analysis.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of BGS, below, we can see that prices have been in a decline the past 12 months. The slope of both the 50-day simple moving average line and the 200-day moving average line have been negative. Prices are testing/breaking the 50-day line but that is not enough to recommend the long side.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a decline to a late August low and some improvement in September so far. This too is not enough to get bullish.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum indicator has been making higher lows since May which is a bullish divergence when compared to the lower price lows over the same time period. The pace of the decline has been slowing.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of BGS, below, we can see that prices have suffered a bigger decline over the past three years. The 40-week moving average line is bearish.\n\nThe OBV line is negative and there is little trend strength from the MACD oscillator.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of BGS, below, we can see a tentative upside price target in the $24-$25 area.\n\nBottom line strategy: BGS could make a technical bounce but with the trend still bearish this is not a compelling trade.", "description": "Let's take a look at the charts....BGS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "B G Foods Could Bounce But We'Ll Sit This One Out", "Let'S Take A Look At The Charts.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Dave Butler", "James", "Rev Shark", "Real Money", "Chris Versace", "Paul Price"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/723e025b-59e1-11e8-996b-3970b2ef4c1a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
