Meteorologist Jason Godwin said radar confirmed the twister hit the ground near Love Field Airport and moved northeast through the city. There were no reports of fatalities or serious injuries as of 12:20 a.m. Monday, according to a release from the city of Dallas.\n\nLocal media outlets reported several homes and businesses were damaged, power lines downed and tree limbs were scattered across roadways. The city said there were reports of gas leaks north of Walnut Hill in north Dallas. Police and Fire-Rescue were assessing damaged structures.\n\nCBS Dallas reported significant damage to a Home Depot store, with video showing the front of the store a twisted mess of crumpled metal. Major roadways through Dallas were littered with debris from the storm, leaving a major clean-up operation for work crews to tackle with just hours before Monday morning rush hour.\n\nNearly 112,000 electric customers were without power as of 12:50 a.m., according to Oncor's online outage map. Around 60,000 of those customers were within Dallas, according to the city, which is opening a shelter by 2 a.m.\n\nThe Texas Office of Emergency Management said seven people sustained non-life threatening injuries when an 18-wheeler overturned and hit several other vehicles.\n\nSeven people escaped a structure that collapsed in northwest Dallas, but Dallas Fire-Rescue were searching to see if anyone was left inside, spokesman Jason Evans said. WFAA reported that a convenience store collapsed in the storm, but the clerk told the station that everyone who was inside made it out safely.\n\nEvans said the department had also received multiple calls from people injured in their homes by broken glass.\n\nGodwin said the size and severity of the tornado won't be known until crews arrive to survey the damage.\n\nThe storm happened as multiple severe thunderstorm watches and warnings covered portions of four counties, including Dallas County, and more stormy weather was expected in the area during the overnight hours.\n\nThe city of Sachse, a northeast suburb of Dallas, said six houses \"sustained significant high-wind damage after severe weather moved through the area Sunday night.\" Four homes were left uninhabitable, but no injuries had been reported.\n\nDallas police said officers in one part of the city were going door-to-door to check on residents.\n\nCiting extensive damage to campuses, the Dallas Independent School District canceled Monday classes at six schools: David G. Burnet Elementary School, Leonides Gonzalez Cigarroa Elementary School, John J. Pershing Elementary School, Walnut Hill Elementary School, Edward H. Cary Middle School and Thomas Jefferson High School. The Episcopal School of Dallas also canceled classes.
