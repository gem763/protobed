Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) campaign announced on Tuesday that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 with an average donation of $18.07.\n\nThe massive haul beats out his prior fundraising totals during his second bid for the presidency in which he brought in around $18 million and is, at the moment, the largest single quarter reported of any 2020 candidates throughout the year. Sanders is the first among his rivals to reveal his numbers for this quarter.\n\nThat total, from 1.4 million donations, was fueled in part by a record-setting month for the campaign in September and arrived at a moment when the Vermont senator had appeared to be stagnating in some polls.\n\n\u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations\u2014both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said. \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d\n\nIn the second fundraising quarter, both former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg outpaced Sanders in fundraising with $21.5 million and $24.8 million, respectively, though unlike Sanders they relied on high-dollar fundraisers to help fuel the totals.\n\nThe Sanders campaign also said the final day of the third quarter was the second biggest fundraising day of the campaign and that \u201cteacher\u201d was the most common occupation of his donors, with the most common employers being Starbucks, Amazon, and Walmart. Since launching in February, they have raised $61.5 million from 3.3 million individual donations, with more than 99.9 percent not maxed out and still able to continue giving money to the campaign.", "description": "The quarter is among his best in both presidential campaigns he\u2019s run and perhaps the largest of the 2020 cycle thus far.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1430,w_2542,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569906137/bernie_fundraising_of4oom", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
