The Seoul-Washington working group is led by Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea, and Lee Do-hoon, South Korea\u2019s special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs.The meeting between Biegun and Kim in Stockholm was the first working-level talk since the second North-U.S. summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Feb. 28 collapsed. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump had a third impromptu meeting at the demilitarized zone on June 30, but denuclearization negotiations continued to remain at an impasse.\u201cA regular consultative body is needed because prior consultations are necessary for a third North-U.S. summit,\u201d said another source. \u201cBut beyond that, it also is taking into consideration that if a deal is made, it can become a body in order for each side to review and verify each other\u2019s implementation.\u201dImmediately after the breakdown of talks in Stockholm, Kim Myong-gil expressed disappointment that Washington had failed to bring a \u201cnew calculation method.\u201dIn the joint statement after the first North-U.S. summit in 2018, North Korean leader Kim and Trump committed to establishing new North Korea-U.S. relations, building a \u201clasting and stable peace regime\u201d and the \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula.The fourth point of the joint statement dealt with recovering and repatriating the remains of U.S. troops from the 1950-53 Korean War.One source said that Biegun in Stockholm is said to have proposed in accordance to Articles 1 and 2 of the Singapore statement the setting up of North Korean and U.S. liaison offices, a declaration to end the Korean War and humanitarian aid, along with the freeze of nuclear materials and measures beyond the dismantling of North Korea\u2019s Yongbyon nuclear complex.This indicates that in the larger frame, there was not much difference from what was proposed during the failed Hanoi summit in the latest talks.However, the U.S. team was said to have emphasized its position that it was \u201copen to discussions\u201d in response to Pyongyang\u2019s demands that Washington take corresponding measures to the North\u2019s halting of its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests and shutting down of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site.Kim speaking to reporters in front of the North Korean Embassy in Stockholm on Oct. 5 was critical of Washington\u2019s \u201cinability to abandon its outdated position and attitude\u201d and called the negotiations a waste of time.It was noted that the atmosphere seems to have changed drastically between the morning and afternoon sessions at the Villa Elfvik Strand in Stockholm, as Kim was seen to have received instructions from Pyongyang during a lunch break.BY SEO SEUNG-WOOK, JUNG HYO-SIK AND SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/14204332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
