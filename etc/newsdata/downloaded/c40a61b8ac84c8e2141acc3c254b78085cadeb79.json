The coverage has been, on average, 90% negative according to a series of studies by the Media Research Center. There\u2019s some unexpected collateral damage, though.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls are paying a price for this obsession. Network \u201cfixation on Trump\u201d is leaving comparatively little airtime for his would-be challengers, the conservative press watchdog says in a new analysis released Monday.\n\n\u201cFrom June 1 through August 31, analysts found the networks devoted 838 minutes of airtime \u2014 nearly 14 hours \u2014 to coverage of President Trump personally, the vast majority of which was negative,\u201d writes Rich Noyes, who led the study.\n\n\u201cThe airtime devoted to Trump was 11 times greater than that spent on the leading Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden (just under 74 minutes), and vastly more than the networks gave California Sen. Kamala Harris (30 minutes), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (15 minutes) or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (just under 14 minutes),\u201d Mr. Noyes said.\n\n\u201cOverall, 21 Democratic candidates (including some who have since departed the race) shared 187 minutes of evening news airtime this summer, less than one-fourth of that of Trump alone. On the GOP side, former Congressman Joe Walsh received a scant 35 seconds of coverage after he announced his candidacy in late August, while the campaign of former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld has yet to be acknowledged by any of the three evening newscasts,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe coverage, Mr. Noyes explains, is not meant to help Mr. Trump. The content remains centered on \u201calleged scandals and racism\u201d for the most part.\n\n\u201cMedia mania over Trump is more intense than that of four summers ago. After Trump joined the race in mid-June 2015, he immediately dominated network news coverage with 232 minutes of airtime, twice that of Hillary Clinton, and six times more than his nearest Republican challenger, Jeb Bush,\u201d Mr. Noyes said.\n\nPRO-LIFE GETS A LEGISLATIVE BOOST\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and pro-life House Republican leaders will hold a hearing Tuesday on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, legislation to protect babies born alive in failed abortions. Witnesses include Jill Stanek, a medical professional left with a disturbing memory.\n\n\u201cAs a nurse I held a precious child who had been abandoned to die alone in the hospital\u2019s soiled utility room after surviving an abortion. Twenty years later, we are still fighting for the basic care these little ones deserve,\u201d she explains.\n\nAlso appearing: Obstetrician Dr. Kathi Aultman, neonatologist Dr. Robin Pierucci and researcher Tessa Longbons.\n\n\u201cThis compassionate legislation should have passed easily six months ago considering the overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 including 70% of Democrats \u2014 support it, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Party leaders have blocked pro-life Republicans\u2019 requests for a vote more than 80 times,\u201d says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which seeks to end abortion by electing more pro-life national officials.\n\nTHE COAST GUARD GETS APPLAUSE\n\nHeroism over seven decades ago has not been forgotten. On Tuesday, the Coast Guard will be awarded a medal by the OSS Society to recognize its World War II-era contributions to the OSS \u2014 the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n\u201cThe Coast Guard\u2019s support to the OSS on covert, counter-intelligence, espionage and sabotage operations in the maritime environment was a unique instrument for national security policy during World War II domestically and abroad, and it helped lay the foundation for future Coast Guard operations. Because the information was classified for so long, the public is not fully aware of the relationship between the OSS and the Coast Guard, including Coast Guardsmen attached to the OSS in Europe and the China-Burma-India Theatre,\u201d the organizers note.\n\nOn hand for the moment, which takes place in the nation\u2019s capital: Commandant of the Coast Guard Adm. Karl Schultz; Vice Commandant Guard Adm. Charles Ray; Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard Jason Vanderhaden; and Charles Pinck, president of the OSS Society.\n\nTRACKING THE NRA\n\nConsider that the National Rifle Association has over 5 million members.\n\n\u201cAmong all likely voters, 23% favor declaring the NRA to be a terrorist organization in their home community, while 18% think it should be against the law to belong to pro-gun rights groups like the NRA,\u201d says a new Rasmussen Reports survey released Monday.\n\n\u201cNearly 1-out-of-3 likely Democratic voters (32%) favor declaring the gun rights group a terrorist organization; 14% of Republicans and 20% of independent voters agree,\u201d the pollster says.\n\nThe survey also revealed that 28% of Democrats say Americans should be prohibited by law from belonging to organizations like the NRA; 18% of voters overall plus 15% of Republicans and 10% of unaffiliated voters agree.\n\n\u201cOnly 13% believe NRA members are more likely to commit a crime with a gun. A plurality (47%) says members of the group are less likely to commit such a crime, while 28% think the level of gun crime by NRA members is about the same as in the population at large,\u201d the survey said.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 83% of Americans support background checks for all gun purchases; 72% of Republicans, 84% of independents and 94% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 75% overall support a \u201cred flag law\u201d for gun possession by people who pose a threat; 63% of Republicans, 70% of independents and 92% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 62% overall support a national gun ownership data base; 35% of Republicans, 59% of independents and 85% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 50% overall worry background checks and a data base would be used to monitor citizen activities; 61% of Republicans, 50% of independents and 32% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A Monmouth University poll of 800 U.S. adults conducted Aug. 16-29 and released Monday.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
