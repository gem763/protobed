She was herself\".\n\n\"She clapped back and she wouldn't take people's narrow-mindedness\".\n\nImage copyright Han Myung-Gu Image caption Sulli released her first solo song this year\n\nTaylor says Sulli's former band f(x) changed K-pop.\n\n\"They were one of the girl groups that didn't fit in, they did their own thing. Their music was more hard-hitting. It was innovative and complex, and it helped cement an entire sub-genre within K-pop - girl crush.\n\n\"When she left, her legacy became being outspoken. It became taking control of her own image. I admired her spirit to do so despite the constant negativity.\"\n\nSulli's former f(x) bandmate, Amber Liu, has posted her shock at what's happened.\n\nSulli was known for being controversial and outspoken.
