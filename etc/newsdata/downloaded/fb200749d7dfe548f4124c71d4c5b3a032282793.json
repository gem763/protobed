After its big debut, the pony car sold like crazy, and the coupe proved to be far more popular than the convertible model.\n\nIn the early '60s, Ford correctly predicted what the market needed with a new kind of car. The driving age was quickly approaching for the Baby Boomer generation, and a second family car was becoming more common. Whether it was a single adult buying their first car or an addition to a family fleet, nobody was looking for a mundane and unexciting ride. When the Mustang launched, it added a bit of excitement. It was sporty and lean, had some flair, was available with additional performance and comfort options, and also, it was compact and economical.\n\nToday, Ford's first compact pony car is a hot commodity. Especially a pristine example like this one. You may be hard-pressed to find one in even better shape. With its glossy dark exterior paint, interior, and convertible top in fantastic shape, this classic Mustang would make the perfect addition to your garage. Imagine waking up everyday and coming to the realization that this beauty belongs to you everyday. The car is listed at $33,500 on Frazier Motorcar Company, but feel free to visit the site here or call and make an offer.\n\nRead More...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "This shiny classic gem is awaiting a new place to call home.When the first Mustang model was created, who would have predicted that it would turn into the pony car collectible that it is today.
