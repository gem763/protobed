What comes to mind? A concierge ready to advise on the neighborhood\u2019s cheapest nachos? A lounge permanently set up for beer pong? Housekeeping you\u2019d best not examine too closely, if my old dorm is at all representative?\n\nBut teaching hotels\u2014the hospitality-school equivalent of a teaching hospital, where students put classroom theory into real world practice\u2014are more than \u201cAnimal House\u201d with embroidered towels. During a recent visit to Ithaca, N.Y., I stayed at Cornell University\u2019s on-campus Statler Hotel, run by their School of Hotel Administration. For more than 90 years it\u2019s brought Ivy-League rigor to the hospitality arts. Alongside the professional staff, more than 200 students work in the hotel, from the valet stand to the manager\u2019s office. Students wear name tags that identify which of the university\u2019s colleges they attend and their projected graduation date. Alex Susskind, the school\u2019s associate dean for Academic Affairs, said the 153-room hotel \u201cis as important to us as any other part of our educational program.\u201d\n\nMy room, outfitted with Frette towels and robes, was clinically clean. Hanging in the closet near the robes was a \u201cGiving Bag,\u201d a student-conceived initiative that lets guests donate to charity any usable items they choose to leave behind. Downstairs, the hotel\u2019s Regent Lounge featured locally produced wine and beer and spirits, like Finger Lakes Distilling\u2019s McKenzie Bourbon, which my server\u2014a biology student\u2014recommended in an Old Fashioned.\n\n\u201c \u2018The more difficult guests teach kindness and patience.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe student staffers I encountered appeared to treat their work seriously, which made sense; for most of them it was more than just a part-time gig, it was the foundation of a career. \u201cI started off working in housekeeping doing laundry, turndown and public areas,\u201d said Nathan Harkins, a Hotelie, as students and graduates of the School of Hotel Administration are called (the hotel\u2019s gift shop sells gear with the term spelled out in Cornell\u2019s signature red block letters). Mr. Harkins finagled his way into revenue management meetings, then worked his way up to the position of student director of rooms. He hopes to ascend to student general manager before he graduates in 2020.\n\nStudents also see us guests as more than just clients; we\u2019re curriculum. In the Netherlands, students at the Hotel Management School Maastricht put in time at the 26-room Teaching Hotel Ch\u00e2teau Bethlehem, where \u201cevery guest can teach the students something,\u201d said Eline Rademaker, the hotel\u2019s director of marketing and sales. \u201cThe more difficult guests teach kindness and patience. The \u2018easiest\u2019 ones teach about not becoming too informal with guests.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you ever experienced above-and-beyond service at a hotel? At which hotel? What was so impressive about the service? Join the conversation below.\n\nA lot of the lessons with which the students grapple are not readily apparent to guests. At the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management at the University of Houston, students don\u2019t just help run the university\u2019s Hilton hotel, where they comprise 70% of the staff. They\u2019re also involved in the planning and execution of a $30.4-million expansion, said the college\u2019s dean, Dennis Reynolds (a Hotelie himself.) \u201cWe had a semester-long class where they did the design [for a brewpub],\u201d said Mr. Reynolds, \u201cand a semester-long class where they did the business plan.\u201d Hopefully, by the time the pub opens, the designers will be old enough to toast their accomplishments with a beer.\n\nThese accommodations aren\u2019t particularly cheap. Room rates at teaching hotels typically align with those of other full-service accommodations (rates at the Statler Hotel start at around $265 a night). The value proposition is in the service. A teaching hotel, after all, is never, ever understaffed. \u201cWhen you have seven people at the front desk checking in two people, that\u2019s not the model for making a lot of profit,\u201d said Mr. Reynolds. \u201cWhen Hilton executives come and visit us, I get an earful every time.\u201d His response? \u201cWe\u2019re a teaching hotel\u2014that\u2019s the whole idea.\u201d\n\nGUEST STARS / Tips From Hospitality-School Deans, Alum and Other Pros on Acing Your Next Hotel Stay\n\nHow to get an upgrade?\n\nIllustration: FEDERICA DEL PROPOSTO\n\n\u201cAsk if a different [or] better room is available. If a hotel is not full and won\u2019t be during your stay, the marginal cost for an upgrade to the hotel is small,\u201d said Alex Susskind, associate dean for Academic Affairs at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration. In his book \u201cHeads in Beds,\u201d author and former hotel employee Jacob Tomsky suggests one way to make your ask more persuasive. \u201cMoney. Cash on the desk...Even if I can\u2019t find an upgrade proper, I will put you in the very best room of your category...There is always a better room, and when I feel that twenty burning in my pocket, I will find it for you.\u201d\n\nWhat to tip the housekeeper?\n\nA budget or midprice hotels, Mr. Susskind says he leaves a couple of dollars per night. \u201cUpscale and above, $5 or so per night,\u201d he added. But don\u2019t just leave the cash. \u201cMake sure to leave a note so [your housekeeper] can be sure that it is for them,\u201d said Nathan Harkins, Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration, Class of \u201920. \u201cWant your housekeeper to actually love you? Strip all of the sheets of the bed and leave them in a pile, leave your towels in a pile.\u201d\n\nBeyond tipping, how can you reward above-and-beyond service?\n\n\u201cMany hotels have incentive programs by which the employee will get credit for review mentions: recognition in a staff meeting or some sort of prize,\u201d said Mr. Harkins, so \u201cmention their name in a review on TripAdvisor or whatever website you used to book the room.\u201d\n\nThings go wrong. When is an apology not enough?\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the severity,\u201d said Dennis Reynolds, dean of the University of Houston\u2019s Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. \u201cIf the Wi-Fi fails for an hour, I think an apology is sufficient. If the hotel system fails because of planned construction and the hotel didn\u2019t tell the guests, then we\u2019ll probably need to discuss the appropriate solution, which might be a drink coupon, free dessert or even a meal.\u201d", "description": "At teaching hotels, including Cornell University\u2019s Statler, you don\u2019t just get top-of-the-class service, you\u2019re part of the lesson plan.
