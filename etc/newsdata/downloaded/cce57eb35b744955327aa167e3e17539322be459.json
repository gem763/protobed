In comparison, last August logged an annual increase of 2.1%.\n\n\n\nMore: Three-Bedroom Homes in Scotland are the Quickest to Sell in the U.K.\n\nThough London and its surrounding regions have been acting as a drag on national prices for the past two years, that\u2019s no longer the case. But they aren\u2019t boosting prices either, the report said.\n\n\n\nAnd prices are still growing more steadily in the north of the country.\n\n\n\nWales remained on top for property price growth for the fourth month in succession, logging annual price gains of 2.5%, putting the average at \u00a3186,788. The North West of England followed, with gains of 1.7% to \u00a3195,025\n\n\n\nLondon climbed back into positive territory and ranked fifth for price growth after seeing prices increase 0.7%, equating to \u00a34,100, leaving average prices standing at \u00a3605,557.\n\n\n\nOnly the East of England and the South East logged annual price falls\u2014as they have done consistently for the last five months, the report said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Anthony Bourdain\u2019s Personal Property Hits Auction\n\nLike house prices, transaction levels were sluggish in August.\n\n\n\nLast month there were an estimated 76,000 sales across England and Wales. The figure is lower than the 81,000 sales logged in July.\n\n\n\nAs with prices, the better performance is being seen in the north, with those regions logging slight upticks in sales, or at least smaller declines, compared to their southern neighbors.\n\n\n\nAffordability is cited as a major driver influencing the increases.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-108036?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
