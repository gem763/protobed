It was a miraculous escape. The plane crashed into the cables but fortunately it became stuck rather than crashing to the ground.\n\n'The rescue operation was very tricky. The rescuers had to very carefully manoeuvre along the cables very, very slowly. We didn't want the cables moving any more than necessary.\n\n'Ropes were then secured around the two men. The whole operation to bring them to safety took an hour and a half.\n\nOne rescuer said it was 'a miracle' the two men survived after their light aircraft became tangled in ski lift power cables\n\n'We had 20 rescue personnel and two helicopters involved.\n\n'It was a miracle. The pilot suffered injuries but not too serious. Both men were of course very shocked also.'\n\nMountain guide Marco Confortola, who posted a video on Facebook showing him edging along the cable to reach the victims, said: 'The mountain rescue service worked perfectly. [The operation was conducted] with speed and professionalism.'\n\nAn investigation has been opened to determine the cause of the crash.\n\nMr Milan said: 'There are a number of possible reasons for the crash such as human error or a mechanical failure but we do not want to speculate. There is an investigation.'", "description": "Dramatic images from the scene in the Italian Alps show a light aircraft entangled in the overhead cables powering a chair lift and left dangling upside down.
