But you needn\u2019t spend anything to have pots spilling over with colourful plants \u2014 if you know someone else with a garden.\n\nTaking cuttings is quick, won\u2019t harm the original plants, needs no special kit and costs zero. As summer comes to an end this is a great time to save seeds, take cuttings and divide plants to make more.\n\nFrom geraniums to poppies, love-in-a-mist to mint, here\u2019s how to get your hands on free plants even if you\u2019re a total beginner.\n\nSnip it\n\nWhether white, pillar box red or in-your-face pink, pelargoniums are the quintessential city plant, thriving in pots on windowsills and balconies.\n\nIf you find one you like, choose a stem that doesn\u2019t have a flower or buds on the end and cut it so it is about 10cm long.\n\nStore it in damp kitchen roll until you get home. Using a sharp knife, cut the bottom end of the stem just below a leaf and then remove the leaf.\n\nSuspend the stems in jam jars of water on a windowsill so the bottom end is under water. Roots will soon form.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks, you can transplant the seedlings into small pots and overwinter them on a kitchen windowsill. Next spring they can go outside \u2014 or stay inside as house plants.\n\nSplit it\n\nHardy geraniums are city troopers that will flower for months, quickly covering bare patches with colour and knitting other plants together like a magic glue.\n\nSave your seeds: it's easy to save seed from annuals such as cornflowers and rudbeckia (From Gardening on a Shoestring. Photographer Sarah Cuttle)\n\nIf you know someone with a large clump of these, especially if it is growing happily in similar conditions to your own garden, leap at the chance to bring some home.\n\nWait until it has finished flowering, then lift the whole plant gently with a garden fork. You can then split the root ball into two (two forks back to back work wonders).\n\nQuickly replant half and water it well then put your pilfered section in a plastic bag to keep the rootball moist until you can get it home and replant it where you want.\n\nSteal seedlings\n\nVerbena bonariensis seeds everywhere. Just dig up its seedlings, take them home and replant them (From Gardening on a Shoestring. Photographer Sarah Cuttle)\n\nLady\u2019s mantle, verbena bonariensis and rose campion are such popular plants I\u2019d challenge you to find a London garden that doesn\u2019t contain at least one. Look around the base of the plant and you will likely find its babies.\n\nDig up a seedling with a trowel taking care not to damage the roots and pop it in a plastic bag to keep it moist till you get home. Then just transplant it into its new position and water it in. Job done.\n\nJust nick a bit\n\nSome plants are so keen to spread that they won\u2019t notice if you take a piece around the outside.\n\nIf you hanker after lamb\u2019s ear, the silvery furry ground cover with strokable leaves, or want some fresh mint, dig up a section around the edge with a trowel.\n\nAs long some roots remain on it, it will grow on in a new position and soon spread. Put it in a plastic bag to keep it moist until you get home and then transplant it, watering in well.\n\nSave seed\n\nThere\u2019s no need to buy seeds of classic cottage flowers such as love-in-a-mist, poppies, cornflowers, cosmos and marigolds if you have friends growing them.\n\nAt this time of year annual flowers like this have set seed and you can simply take it. Snap off the dried papery seed cases or heads and put them in an envelope.\n\nWhen you get home, tap the seeds out, separating them from the case, and store them in a dry drawer.\n\nOne of those sachets of silica beads you get when you buy shoes or bags will make sure they stay dry. Next spring, sow as normal into your window boxes, pots or garden soil.\n\nGardening on a Shoestring by Alex Mitchell, with photography by Sarah Cuttle, is published by Kyle Books", "description": "Even if your garden is tiny, the cost of buying plants from a garden centre can quickly mount up.
