However, the buck did not die and attacked the hunter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long he left it there, but he went up to check it to make sure it was dead. And evidently it wasn\u2019t,\" said Keith Stephens, the chief of communications with the agency.\n\nStephens said Alexander was left with \u201cseveral puncture wounds\u201d after the altercation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlexander, who was hunting alone, was able to contact his family who called emergency responders, the outlet noted. He later died at a local hospital.\n\nStephens said it is unclear if Alexander died from the puncture wounds or from another health-related cause such as a heart attack. Alexander\u2019s body did not undergo an autopsy, so Stephens said \u201cwe may never know [what] actually happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked for the Game and Fish Commission for 20 years, and it\u2019s one of the stranger things that\u2019s happened,\" he continued.\n\nHunters are encouraged to wait for the deer to be still and unmoving for about 30 minutes before approaching it.", "description": "A hunter died this week after he was attacked by a deer that he had shot, according to officials with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/deer_getty_102519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
