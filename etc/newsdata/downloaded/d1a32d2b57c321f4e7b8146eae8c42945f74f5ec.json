He hit 382 homers in 16 major league seasons.\n\nBaseball did not return to the nation's capital until 2005, when the Montreal Expos relocated and became the Nationals.\n\nJanyia Freeman, a young scholar-athlete from the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The academy brings baseball and softball to underserved youth in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. Army Brass Quintet performed the national anthem.\n\n___\n\n7:22 p.m.\n\nAroldis Chapman says he has not yet decided whether to opt out of the final two years of his contract with the New York Yankees, which guarantees $30 million.\n\nChapman was at the World Series on Saturday to receive the AL Reliever of the Year award from Mariano Rivera. Milwaukee's Josh Hader got the NL honor from Trevor Hoffman.\n\nTraded by the Yankees to the Chicago Cubs in July 2016, Chapman returned to the Yankees as a free agent that December for an $86 million, five-year deal that included $15 million salaries in 2020 and '21.\n\nThe 31-year-old left-hander received the award a week after allowing a pennant-winning home run to Houston's Jos\u00e9 Altuve in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series.\n\n___\n\n5:31 p.m.\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki was out of the starting lineup for Game 4 of the World Series on Saturday night after injuring his right hip flexor.\n\nSuzuki had not been expected to start with left-hander Patrick Corbin on the mound for Washington.

But Suzuki's availability for the rest of the series is in question.\n\nSuzuki was pinch hit for in the sixth inning of Washington's 4-1 loss to Houston on Friday, which pulled the Astros to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.\n\nGomes is 2 for 10 with one RBI in the World Series.\n\nRaudy Reed and Tres Barrera are the other catchers on Washington's 40-man roster.\n\nNL Championship Series MVP Howie Kendrick was back in the Nationals' starting lineup at second base, a night after Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera was at second. Kendrick pinch hit and singled in the eighth inning of Game 3. The designated hitter in Houston, Kendrick has three errors in the postseason.\n\nWith no DH, rookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez remained out of the Astros' starting lineup.
