(Mark Brown/Getty)\n\nPlaying at age 42, Tom Brady no longer takes the sort of hits that he used to take when he was playing at 22 or even 32.\n\nPart of the reason for that is because Brady has become adept at getting rid of the ball, sidestepping pash rushers and knowing when to slide instead of staying upright and taking a big hit.\n\nAnother part of the reason is that the NFL has changed the rules of professional football during Brady\u2019s career in order to protect the quarterback in ways that guys who played in the \u201970s and \u201980s never could have imagined.\n\nAnd, according to Miami Dolphins linebacker Raekwon McMillan, a third part of the reason why Brady doesn\u2019t get hit is that officials warn players not to touch him during games.\n\nSpeaking to The Miami Herald, McMillan said he delivered a legal hit on Brady during Miami\u2019s 43-o loss to the Patriots on Sunday and was warned not to do it again by game ref Bill Vinovich.\n\n\u201cTom didn\u2019t say anything but the referee said, \u2018Stay off Tom.\u2019 I put my hands up in the air and said \u2018I got you,\u2019\u201d McMillan told the paper.\n\nThough McMillan wasn\u2019t flagged on the play, it\u2019s just more evidence quarterbacks are going to get the benefit of the doubt with calls, especially in the wake of injuries to starting QBs Nick Foles, Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees, Trevor Siemian and Cam Newton.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
