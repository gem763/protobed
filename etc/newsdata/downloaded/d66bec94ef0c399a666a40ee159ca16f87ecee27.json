(AP) - Tennessee linebacker Jeremy Banks was arrested early Sunday morning after a records check during a traffic stop revealed he had an active warrant for failure to appear on an earlier charge.\n\nUniversity of Tennessee police said Banks made an illegal U-turn Sunday shortly before 4 a.m. Police said they arrested Banks for having an active warrant for failure to appear in court following a July 17 citation on a charge of driving with a suspended license.\n\nTennessee athletic department spokesman Zach Stipe said \u201cwe are aware of the situation\u201d and added that \u201cit was related to an unresolved traffic violation which he has now resolved.\u201d\n\nBanks has alternated between linebacker and running back since arriving at Tennessee last year. The sophomore had two interceptions Saturday in a 45-0 victory over Chattanooga, making him the first Tennessee linebacker to pick off two passes in a game since Mark Burns did it against Mississippi in 1981.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tennessee linebacker Jeremy Banks was arrested early Sunday morning after a records check during a traffic stop revealed he had an active warrant for failure to appear on an earlier charge.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
