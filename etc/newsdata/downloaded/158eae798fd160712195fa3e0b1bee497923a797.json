And House Democrats may call other companies to testify as well. The increased attention to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, comes as manufacturers like 3M pour millions into combatting regulation of the chemicals.\n\nMany communities have experienced devastating side effects that they link to PFAS exposure, including cancer. But for decades, the man-made class of chemicals found in everything from Teflon pans to firefighting foam has largely gone unregulated.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has controversially declined to set a maximum containment level (MCL) \u2014 or drinking water quality standard \u2014 for PFAS, even as the agency has pledged that it will act on the issue by the end of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, the EPA imposes a non-enforceable health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, a standard that applies to only two types of PFAS chemicals, PFOS and PFOA, despite the growing prominence of other chemicals like GenX. Meanwhile, PFAS are increasingly appearing in water and food sources, including on farms.\n\nDuring a Wednesday hearing of the House Oversight Environment Subcommittee, Chairman Harley Rouda (D-CA) criticized the companies behind PFAS, including DuPont and 3M. Both companies knew as early as the 1970s that PFOS and PFOA were toxic to humans. DuPont even tested the blood of employees for PFAS, while 3M circulated an internal memo in 1978 underscoring the toxicity of its products.\n\n\u201cYou would think that in the United States, when we know a substance is toxic, we would take immediate action to prevent corporations from pumping those substances into our bodies and the environment,\u201d said Rouda in opening remarks that focused largely on accountability from manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThese corporations neglected to tell people what was in those products and, worse yet, suppressed the scientific evidence that these chemicals were hazardous,\u201d the lawmaker emphasized.\n\nIn addition to that line of attack, Wednesday\u2019s hearing examined the health risks associated with PFAS, along with the EPA\u2019s controversial decision to stall efforts to regulate the chemicals \u2014 a move slammed by communities in impacted areas like New York and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cI need polluters to be held accountable,\u201d said one witness, Sandy Wynn-Stelt from Michigan.\n\nHer blood contains a high level of fluorochemicals linked to drinking water contaminated by a neighboring dump filled with PFAS-laden Scotchguard, a source that may also have killed her husband. Wednesday\u2019s hearing also brought testimony from areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia, where a PFOA leak from a DuPont plant contaminated the area\u2019s water supply for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats indicated on Wednesday that they plan to continue pursuing corporate accountability. They announced a Sept. 10 hearing that will focus on what companies knew about PFAS\u2019 risks and to what extent they hid that information.\n\nIn a statement, 3M said the company would testify at that hearing and would share \u201cour perspective and research\u201d with lawmakers. DuPont and other manufacturers have also been invited but it is not clear yet whether they will attend. Lawmakers have said they may seek to compel companies to testify if they do not agree to engage voluntarily.\n\nAs Democrats\u2019 scrutiny grows more aggressive, corporations are boosting lobbying efforts. E&E News reported on Thursday that a lobbying boom has been sparked; 3M has spent $1.89 million in this year\u2019s second quarter, marking a 103% increase over the same period last year.\n\nThose expenses relate to a variety of issues but include pushing back on efforts to regulate PFAS. Chemours, a company spun off from DuPont and associated with GenX contamination in North Carolina water, has also ramped up its lobbying on \u201cPFAS legislative proposals,\u201d as have other manufacturers.\n\nSuch lobbying efforts are only likely to increase. Corporate accountability has become increasingly popular after successful suits against the tobacco industry, which knowingly concealed the risks associated with nicotine from the public for years. More recently, states and cities have moved to hold fossil fuel corporations like ExxonMobil responsible for hiding the dangers of climate change from the public while continuing to push their products.\n\nAnd even as lawmakers move to take action on the federal level, state governments are also cracking down. Michigan, a state plagued by water crises, has indicated that it will not wait for the EPA to regulate PFAS. Instead, officials are looking into regulating certain PFAS chemicals themselves in order to protect residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatherine McCabe, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, also said on Wednesday that her state is looking to target corporations.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey believes that the manufacturers\u2026 should be held responsible to the public for the costs and damages of the drinking water contamination and other harmful consequences of their actions and negligence,\u201d she said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1129733736.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
