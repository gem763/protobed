R. Martin's companion book \"Fire & Blood.\"\n\nTaking place 300 years before the events of \"Game of Thrones,\" the series will depict the stories of the Targaryen kings who had long ruled Westeros.\n\nMiguel Sapochnik and Ryan Condal will partner as showrunners, according to the premium cable channel, with both also poised to work as executive producers alongside George R. R. Martin and Vince Gerardis.\n\n\"The 'Game of Thrones' universe is so rich with stories,\" Casey Bloys, president of HBO programming, said in a statement.\n\n\"We look forward to exploring the origins of House Targaryen and the earlier days of Westeros along with Miguel, Ryan and George.\"\n\nSapochnik, who directed six episodes of the flagship show \u2014 including \"Battle of the Bastards,\" which is IMDB's highest-rated episode \u2014 will direct the \"House of the Dragon\" pilot.\n\nThe announcement comes shortly after reports emerged on Tuesday that the cable network had scrapped another spin-off series of \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nA much-anticipated prequel starring Naomi Watts was reportedly axed after HBO opted not to commission a full series.\n\nHBO has always been known for its heavily curated content. Shows like \"Vinyl\" and \"Hung\" were canceled because they were not as strongly received by viewers as other shows, despite millions of dollars' worth of investment and critical acclaim.\n\nThe premium cable service has put much of its production power behind new shows like \"Watchmen,\" which debuted earlier this month to favorable reviews from critics, as well as new seasons of \"Westworld,\" \"Barry\" and \"Last Week Tonight.\"\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.", "description": "HBO has confirmed details of a new \"Game of Thrones\" prequel called \"House of the Dragon.\"", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104643352-game-thrones-daenerys-quote.jpg?v=1529475928", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
