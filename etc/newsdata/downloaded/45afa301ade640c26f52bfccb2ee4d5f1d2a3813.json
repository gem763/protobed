We have lodged stern representations to the Australian side and pointed out the inappropriate nature of her conduct,\" a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.\n\nMs Payne said in a speech on Tuesday that Australia would continue to raise human rights issues with China and singled out the treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims in the western province of Xinjiang.\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne spoke out on China's human rights record. AP\n\nThe spokesman said it hoped Australia would \"meet China halfway rather than take one step forward and two steps backwards\".\n\nThe Foreign Ministry also responded to comments by former Australian ambassador Geoff Raby published in The Australian Financial Review this week. Mr Raby said megaphone diplomacy would harm Australia's interests and diplomats should be put back in charge of foreign policy.\n\n\"The Australian government should heed these objective and rational voices. It is China's consistent belief that a sound and stable China-Australia relationship serves the fundamental interests of both peoples,\" the spokesman said.", "description": "Beijing says it has lodged \"stern representations\" over comments from the Foreign Minister about China's human rights record.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2319%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_62/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8bf7dd24acc1107ee3bf33e0196ff861e87360be", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
