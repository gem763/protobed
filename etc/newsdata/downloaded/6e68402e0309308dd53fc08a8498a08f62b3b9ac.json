He is believed to have had trials with Ipswich Town.\n\nMindset FC paid tribute on their Facebook page to their former player who \"sadly went to sleep tonight due to knife crime\".\n\nUnderneath a picture of Baptista it read: \"Dark day at mindset as a former player sadly went to sleep tonight due to knife crime.\n\n\"This is becoming all to normal these days and young humble, young people are getting pushed into situations they dont need to be in.\n\n\"Our thoughts and our prayers go out to your family.\n\n\"We try everything in our powers as coaches, youth workers, mentors and just positive role models to avoid these situations. Knife crime needs to stop now.\n\n\"We will be in contact with his family and his other connected teams to raise funds for his family. Watch this space.\n\n\"Rest well little man.\"\n\nSenie Emmanuel, Head of Football Programming at Mindset FC, paid tribute to Baptista, known as 'Bap'.\n\nHe said: \"We signed Bap last season. He was a strong, powerful striker who helped improve our team.\n\n\"He had potential and great attributes as a player.\n\n\"I had a message last night from one of my former players who played alongside him. I'm deeply hurt, upset and totally in shock. You feel numb. I can't imagine what his mum and dad and two brothers are going through.\n\n\"Knife crime just keeps happening and the question is why?\n\n\"Is it because the government aren't putting enough money into youth clubs? I don't know.\n\n\"The young people that are trying to be targeted aren't going to youth clubs so where do you start? It's the million dollar question.\"\n\n(Image: @Slimpriz /Twitter)\n\nPolice say Baptista who \"had everything to live\" for had just got off a bus before an altercation took place during which he was fatally wounded.\n\nA second 15-year-old was found with stab injuries - said to be non life threatening - and has been taken to an east London hospital.\n\nNo arrests have been made and a crime scene remains in place as detectives investigate.\n\nDCI Chris Soole, who is leading the investigation said: \"First and foremost our thoughts are with this young man\u2019s family and friends.\n\n\"They so tragically are having to come to terms with this terrible loss of life.\n\n\"The victim of this stabbing was a schoolboy with his whole life ahead of him. He had everything to live for.\n\n\"This was a senseless attack and we share the concern and alarm this murder will no doubt cause in the local community.\n\n\"We will do everything we [can to] catch those involved and bring them to justice.\n\n\"What we know now is that the victim was attacked on or shortly after alighting from a bus which stopped very close to Stratford Shopping Centre near Tramway Avenue.\n\n\"An altercation took place and he was fatally wounded.\"\n\nThe DCI asked: \"Were you there? Did you see anything? This is a very busy area and lots of people would have been out on the school-run or making their way home.\n\n\"We know that the victim\u2019s friends came to his aid and members of the public provided first aid at the scene.\n\n\"We need anyone else who has information and has not yet spoken to police to come forward.\n\n\"A Section 60 is in place for the whole of Newham borough as a result of this incident.\n\n\"Enquiries, including review of local CCTV footage and forensic analysis is in hand.\n\n\"We are working quickly to build a clear and full picture of precisely what unfolded. If you have information, do the right thing and get in touch.\"\n\nA statement from the Met Police read: \"Police were called on Thursday, 10 October at 15:20hrs to reports of a male found stabbed outside Stratford Broadway near Tramway Avenue.\n\n\"Officers attended along with the London Ambulance Service and the teenager was found with critical injuries.
