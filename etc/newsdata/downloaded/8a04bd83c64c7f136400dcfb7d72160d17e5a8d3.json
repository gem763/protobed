Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg (Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nPresident Trump upped his attacks on the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, demanding the central bank slash interest rates to zero, or even push them into negative territory, claiming that he wants this change to make it cheaper to refinance government debt.\n\nTrump has complained for weeks that some European governments have adopted negative interest rates, and he has said this is unfair and disadvantages the U.S. economy. But Wednesday was the first time he called for the Fed to do the same, pushing what would be an extraordinary policy change that could unleash unknown forces in the U.S. economy.\n\nHis directives were delivered in a series of early morning tweets and came with an extra dose of vitriol for Federal Reserve officials. He called them \u201cboneheads\u201d for not moving more quickly to lower interest rates at a time when he said there was low inflation. The Fed has five governors on its board. Trump has appointed four of them, including Chair Jerome H. Powell, who has been the focus of many White House attacks.\n\n\u201cThe USA should always be paying the lowest rate,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u201cBoneheads.\u201d\n\n....The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s tirade comes on the heels of a disappointing jobs report and a week before the Fed board\u2019s next meeting, where officials will decide whether to cut rates. Trump has tweeted dozens of times in the past month about his Fed grievances, stepping up calls it slash the funds rate as recession fears have grown, but central bank officials remain divided on whether even a modest cut is warranted.\n\nIn July, the Fed cut the benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than a decade, lowering it by a quarter-point to just below 2.25 percent. At the time, Powell said the central bank would do whatever it takes to \u201csustain the expansion,\u201d but he stopped short of committing to further reductions.\n\nThe last time the Fed cut rates to zero was during the Great Recession, and it has never adopted negative rates.\n\n\u201cThe president is calling for what essentially are emergency monetary policy measures at a time when unemployment is at a 50-year low, the U.S. economy is doing better than its peers and is still growing,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy.\n\nThe tweets also suggest Trump\u2019s growing unease over the strength of the U.S. economy \u2014 his central argument for reelection in 2020. On Tuesday, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Trump\u2019s approval rating has slipped as six in 10 Americans now expect a recession within the next year. Trump attacked the results in later tweets Wednesday, calling it a \u201cphony suppression poll.\u201d\n\nThe European Central Bank is expected to announce even deeper negative rates Wednesday as a means of fueling inflation and securing growth in Europe as economies across the continent contract \u2014 a slowdown often attributed to the fallout from the year-long U.S.-China trade war. But economists and policymakers worry that the negative rates are destabilizing the European economy by draining banks, creating conditions that are primed for a crisis.\n\nThe negative rates effectively allow companies and even large governments to be paid to borrow money from global financial markets, while banks must pay to store excess reserves at the ECB. European banks have paid nearly $21.5 billion euros to the ECB since it introduced negative rates in 2014, according to a report from Deposit Solutions, an open banking platform.\n\nNegative rates are an unconventional tool for stimulating the economy, as they eat into banks\u2019 profits and may make it impossible for some insurance companies and pension funds to earn enough from their investments to meet their obligations to policyholders and retirees. Some insurers could fail while banks cut back on lending, starving the economy of fuel needed for growth.\n\nToday, Japan and seven major European governments, including Germany and France, are able to sell bonds with negative yields, as are corporate behemoths Nestl\u00e9 and Sanofi, whose size gives investors confidence they could withstand a downturn.\n\nThe amount of this type of debt, issued as government or corporate bonds, has doubled since December and now totals $15 trillion.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Trump tweeted a quote from CNBC about China\u2019s move to suspend tariffs on certain U.S. goods which suggested that China was being hit harder by the trade war than originally expected. The change applies to such goods as lubricants and pesticides and marked a rare de-escalation in the trade war which the U.S. has yet to reciprocate. But Beijing has not moved to exempt key goods like agricultural products, which Trump says is central to a deal.\n\n\u201cChina suspends Tariffs on some U.S. products. Being hit very hard, supply chains breaking up as many companies move, or look to move, to other countries. Much more expensive to China than originally thought.\u201d @CNBC @JoeSquawk \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nMore exemptions may be announced in the coming weeks, China\u2019s Ministry of Finance said in a statement.", "description": "The tweetstorm comes on the heels of a disappointing jobs report and a week ahead of the Federal Reserve board's next meeting.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "David J.
