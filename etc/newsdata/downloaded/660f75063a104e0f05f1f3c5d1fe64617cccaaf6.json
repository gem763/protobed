He knew he wasn\u2019t sleeping that well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been at a party and he\u2019d come home late; he\u2019d had a few drinks. He might not have taken his medication dose before the party.\n\n\u201cA friend called him around lunch to ask him for golf but he turned it down because he was too tired. We think a combination of lack of sleep, missing tablets and having a few drinks possibly contributed to his death.\"\n\n(Image: News.com.au)\n\nAnny received the devastating news in a phone call on Monday Morning, telling her George had not shown up to work.\n\nGeorge died just two months short of his 30th birthday from SUDEP, which is the sudden and premature death of a person with epilepsy where no reason for the death is found.\n\nIt has echoes of sudden infant death syndrome - SIDS - but Anny says there is far less information about it in the public domain and she is on a mission to raise awareness about the condition.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m a GP but I hadn\u2019t heard of the condition, I\u2019m ashamed to say. There\u2019s more awareness about SIDS.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nEpilepsy Action Australia chief executive Carol Ireland said: \u201cThe common thing I hear from grieving families is, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we know about the risks of this?\u2019\"\n\nThere are hundreds of deaths related to epilepsy each year and and many are due to SUDEP.\n\nCarol Ireland added: \u201cIn most cases, the person is found to have passed away in bed while they were sleeping.\n\n\u201cReducing risk factors associated with SUDEP and epilepsy mortality can save lives and give patients with epilepsy peace of mind.\n\n\"The conversation about risk between doctor and patients with epilepsy needs to be accepted as routine just as it is with other chronic conditions.\u201d", "description": "Anny Marrett's epileptic son George died suddenly and without any obvious reason from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy - SUDEP", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "News.Com.Au"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700096.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GPs-son-dies-in-sleep-from-condition-shes-never-heard-of.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
