Many are using apps that help them assess the cost of a service or drug by various providers and pharmacies. Trump\u2019s order reflects that the practice of deciding what is best for each individual patient does not end when an American turns 65. When more Americans of any age seek the best quality health care at the lowest price, the costs of those services will come down.\n\nEncourages \u201cenhanced access\u201d to health care:\n\nThe implementation of Trump\u2019s executive order would allow more older Americans to access to health care services through telemedicine and other technologies.\n\nJacobs noted this feature could especially be helpful to seniors in rural areas.\n\nVery importantly, the order also seeks to take on states whose restrictions curtail competition in healthcare access and, thus, lead to limited provider networks in Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nOur redesigned #Medicare Plan Finder has been updated with the 2020 Star Ratings so you can compare the quality of health and drug coverage of different plans as you prepare for the upcoming #MedicareOE! https://t.co/BE7ILSx3qV pic.twitter.com/8x0S5z6RGO \u2014 Administrator Seema Verma (@SeemaCMS) October 11, 2019\n\nSeeks elimination of regulatory burdens for providers:\n\nThe executive order demands further improvement of Medicare by \u201celiminating burdensome regulatory billing requirements, conditions of participation, and other requirements that serve as obstacles to more providers participating in the program, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners.\n\nIn a press statement, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) commended Trump for taking \u201cbold steps toward increasing the ability of American seniors to choose the medical care and insurance options best for them, instead of being trapped within increasingly insolvent government-run programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAAPS thanks President Trump for the options he is granting seniors, and the physicians who care for them, in Section 11 of the Executive Order aimed at curbing the further encroachment of socialized medicine in the United States,\u201d said AAPS Executive Director Jane M. Orient, M.D.\n\nAllows Medicare patients to directly receive monetary savings for using healthcare services that provide the best care at the least cost:\n\nTrump\u2019s order wants older Americans to reap the benefits of learning about costs in healthcare services by directly providing them with rebates and allowing them to share in the savings of the updated program.\n\nEnds the Clinton-era rule that required older Americans who wished to opt out of government-run Medicare Part A to forfeit their Social Security benefits:\n\nThe president\u2019s executive order finally demands a change in the 1993 rule that required Medicare and Social Security to be linked together. The Clinton administration wrote the rule that states seniors cannot opt out of Medicare without giving up their Social Security benefits, even though they had been forced to pay into Social Security for years.\n\nThe order states:\n\nWithin 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in coordination with the Commissioner of Social Security, shall revise current rules or policies to preserve the Social Security retirement insurance benefits of seniors who choose not to receive benefits under Medicare Part A, and propose other administrative improvements to Medicare enrollment processes for beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cIt is unethical, not to mention contrary to basic common sense, to insist that American seniors only receive care through Medicare,\u201d said Orient.\n\nAAPS added:\n\nMedicare\u2019s Hospital Trust Fund will be depleted by 2026 and over the next 10-15 years, counting the Trust Funds as assets rather than taxpayer liabilities, the Medicare program is only 71% funded under trustees\u2019 unfavorable assumptions, and 91% under favorable assumptions. Giving seniors the ability to escape this faltering program will help ease the looming crisis as well as give American\u2019s access to options that work best for them, not government bureaucrats.\n\nThe Clinton-era rule was challenged by a nonprofit group seeking healthcare freedom, but, in 2011, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Obama administration and stated \u201crequiring a mechanism for plaintiffs and others in their situation to \u2018dis-enroll\u2019 would be contrary to congressional intent, which was to provide \u2018mandatory\u2019 benefits under Medicare Part A and for those receiving Social Security Retirement benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs are trapped in a government program intended for their benefit,\u201d U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer continued. \u201cThey disagree and wish to escape. The Court can find no loophole or requirement that the Secretary provide such a pathway.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s order, individuals would still be required to pay Medicare taxes, but if they chose private health insurance, they could opt out of the government-run program without forfeiting their Social Security benefits.\n\nJacobs observed the proposal \u201cstands as a common-sense solution to our entitlement shortfalls.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter all, why should we force someone like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett to accept Medicare benefits if they are perfectly content to use other forms of health coverage?\u201d he reasoned.\n\nOrient emphasized the need to increase patient freedom, rather than adopt \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which will eliminate choice.\n\n\u201cWidening escape hatches from an insolvent program and other looming Medicare changes, that will deteriorate patient care and limit their options, is needed now more than ever,\u201d she said.", "description": "Trump's executive order seeks to protect Medicare for older Americans and strengthen it by providing them with more choices.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/older-couple-pensioners-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
