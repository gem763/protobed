These individuals have been detained in two cases and indictments have been issued for both.\u201d\n\n'She's not a spy': friends shocked over academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert's jailing in Iran Read more\n\nHe said one of the cases related to images taken by two foreign nationals from military and restricted areas, and \u201cthe images have been retrieved from the memory of the camera which has been discovered and seized from them\u201d.\n\nThe other case involved a foreign national accused of \u201cspying for another country\u201d Esmaeili said.\n\n\u201cCriminal charges have been issued for both cases and they are waiting for their trial,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be the court that rules if they are guilty and need to be sentenced or whether to issue another verdict.\u201d\n\nIt was the first official confirmation that Australians have been detained in Iran after the Australian government and families of three of them said last week they had been arrested in the Islamic republic.\n\nIt has been reported that all three Australians were being held in Evin prison, though this was not confirmed by Esmaeili.\n\nBritish-Australian woman Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend, Mark Firkin, were arrested 10 weeks ago near the capital. It is understood the pair were flying a drone \u2013 to shoot pictures for a travel blog \u2013 near military installations in Jajrood in Tehran province.\n\nThe couple left their home in Perth, Western Australia, in 2017, documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone. They went silent about 10 weeks ago after posting updates from Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan.\n\nCambridge-educated academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who is also a dual-British citizen, has been held in Iran for \u201ca number of months\u201d according to her family. The Guardian understands she was arrested around September last year.\n\nAustralia left with few diplomatic levers after three citizens detained in Iran Read more\n\nPrevious reports indicated she had been tried on espionage-related charges and sentenced to 10 years\u2019 jail, but Esmaeili said she was also still awaiting trial. Earlier reports also suggested she was being held in Evin in solitary confinement, but the judiciary spokesman offered no comment on this.\n\nIran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency quoted Esmaeili as saying the charges against Moore-Gilbert concerned alleged \u201cspying for another country\u201d, though he did not specify the country.\n\nMoore-Gilbert, a lecturer at University of Melbourne, has written extensively about revolutions and activism in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Shia Islam, Bahraini politics and its protest movements.\n\nMoore-Gilbert\u2019s most recent publications have been journal articles and book chapters on Bahrain\u2019s \u201cFebruary 14\u201d pro-democracy youth movement and online opposition activism during Bahrain\u2019s post-Arab Spring crackdown.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who specialises in Middle Eastern politics, has been detained in Iran \u2018for a number of months\u2019.

The grant was part of the University of Melbourne\u2019s early career researcher grants scheme.\n\nThe Australian government, which first revealed on 11 September that three of its citizens had been detained in Iran, has said it is providing consular assistance for the three detainees.\n\nThe foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said there was \u201cno reason\u201d to believe the arrests were politically motivated.\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iran\u2019s nuclear program, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping.\u201d\n\nIn April Tehran\u2019s top diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif, raised the case of Negar Ghodskani, an Iranian woman arrested by Australia in 2017.\n\nZarif proposed that Iranians jailed in the United States or other countries on extradition requests issued by the Americans could be swapped for US citizens held in Iran.\n\nGhodskani has since been extradited to the US and confessed to participation in a conspiracy to illegally export technology to Iran in breach of sanctions.\n\nAustralia said in August it would join a US-led naval coalition to escort commercial ships in the Gulf, after a spate of attacks blamed on Iran, but which Tehran denied.\n\nHowever, that announcement is understood to have come after the arrest of the three Australians in Iran.\n\nwith Agence France-Presse\n\n", "description": "Cases of British-Australians Kylie Moore-Gilbert and Jolie King, and King\u2019s Australian partner, Mark Firkin, were revealed last week", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66282841a9593768885dcd4a575116b9d469baad/0_218_1810_1086/master/1810.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0ea352ce318b5a3ec9f2f035828ede8", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
