According to a 2012 survey, about 11 percent of US adults have pain every day and more than 17 percent have severe levels of pain.\n\nOften this leads to dependence on potent painkillers like opioids, or attempting to self-medicate through counterfeit or illicit drugs which are increasingly laced with deadly fentanyl.\n\nBy better understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for pain modulation, researchers hope to eventually find better cures: potentially ones that target only those forms of pain that are \"bad\" and not useful.\n\n\"The healthy response is you get pain, it tells you something is wrong, it heals, and the pain goes away,\" said Carrasquillo.\n\n\"In chronic pain, that doesn't happen, the system gets stuck. If we can identify what makes the system gets stuck, then we can reverse it.\"", "description": "Pain perception is essential for survival, but how much something hurts can sometimes be amplified or suppressed: for example, soldiers who sustain an injury in battle often recall not feeling anything at the time.
