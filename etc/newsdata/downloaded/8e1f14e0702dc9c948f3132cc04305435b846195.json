'I remember driving back to the stadium, getting there towards 9pm, and there was an eerie silence where people were still coming to grips with the fact of an accident,' said Stringer.\n\nSunday marks the first anniversary since Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha (right) died in the crash\n\n'There were club employees there who were inconsolable, one of them in floods of tears. I remember giving him a hug. Not a lot was said. We knew the chairman was on board. One thing that will never leave me from that night is the smell of aviation fuel.\n\n'Khun Vichai's legacy is kindness and the devoted spirit he has given his children. His son Khun Top is a chip off the old block. They made dreams come true here.'\n\nThe first manager appointed by the family was Sven-Goran Eriksson. Though the former England boss could not deliver promotion to the Premier League and was sacked, they remained on good terms.\n\nLeicester are still feeling the impact of the helicopter that rocked the entire city a year ago\n\n'They took care of the people, the players and staff, they wanted everything to be very nice,' said Eriksson. 'I was sacked but that was absolutely fair. They gave me resources to buy players and sadly we did not buy the right ones, so results did not come as I had hoped and everyone had hoped.\n\n'There were no hard feelings. I sent messages to him now and then and he would do the same.\n\n'They would invite me down for lunch and we would enjoy each other's company. I liked them very much.\n\n'When Leicester won the title it was something out of this world, beautiful for the city, for England and for football in general.'", "description": "The garden is located on the site of the helicopter crash that exactly a year ago killed Vichai, who was 60, along with two of his staff and two pilots.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/20/20087844-0-image-a-31_1572118382126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
