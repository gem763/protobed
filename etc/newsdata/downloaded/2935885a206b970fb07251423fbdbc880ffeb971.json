The seizure was shortly followed by the Russian military invading Crimea, a peninsula in the Black Sea, and annexing it from Ukraine, triggering international waves of sanctions and resulting in Russia\u2019s expulsion from the former Group of Eight leading industrialized nations, or G-8.\n\nAmong the prisoners released by Russia were are all 24 Ukrainian sailors captured in the Sea of Azov near Crimea last November and Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker Russian authorities accused of plotting terroristic acts, according to a list released by Mr. Zelensky\u2019s office.\n\nThe Kremlin did not immediately identify the freed Russians but confirmed that the 35 included Vladimir Tsemakh, the commander of a separatist group who had been labeled a \u201cperson of interest\u201d by investigators probing the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
