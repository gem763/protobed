We called Samsung because we thought there was a fault with the phone.\n\nHOW WILL FINGERPRINT BANK CARDS WORK? Dutch chipmaker Gemalto has launched a range of bank cards with an in-built fingerprint scanner. This authenticates the payment and replaces the traditional PIN (Personal Identification Numbers). Customers scan their fingerprint on a small sensor found on the right hand-side of the bank card. Fingerprint data is stored on the card, not on a central database. Since the biometric card works with current standards, there is no need to change the existing infrastructure. The magnetic field generated by the card machine used for payment powers the scanner, meaning no battery is needed. For biometric cards, little will have to change. Customers will need to register their fingerprint at their local bank via a tablet. This then stores the biometric data of every person on their card, but not on a central database\n\n'The man in customer services took control of the phone remotely and went into all the settings and finally admitted it looked like a security breach.'\n\nThe problem had begun after she'd bought a \u00a32.70 screen protector from eBay and fitted it.\n\nSouth Korea's online-only KaKaobank has told its customers to stop using the Galaxy 10 fingerprint recognition function to log into its services until the issue is resolved.\n\nLaunched in March, Galaxy S10 series phones have an in-display sensor that uses ultrasound to detect the ridges of fingerprints, which Samsung has touted as a 'revolutionary' biometric authentication feature.", "description": "Samsung rolled out an update to fix an issue found in the Galaxy S10 last week - a cheap screen protector was able to fool the fingerprint recognition and let anyone access the device.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com", "Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/19683232-0-Lisa_Neilson_34_from_Castleford_in_West_Yorkshire_bought_the_gel-a-5_1571320581583.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
