Sign up for that newsletter: HERE.\n\nIt\u2019s been two months since a judge demanded financial records from a high-dollar corporate donor to a leading pro-Trump super PAC. But that company still hasn\u2019t produced records that might show why its top executive is donating big sums to national Republicans while he\u2019s still hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.\n\nThe company, Global Energy Producers LLC (GEP), was a top donor this cycle to America First Action, which was highly active on behalf of midterm Senate candidates supportive of President Donald Trump. One of its top executives, a politically connected Republican named Lev Parnas, has won audiences with the president and prominent Trumpworld figures this year.\n\nParnas is a five-figure GOP donor in his own right. But now a former business associate of his wants to know why GEP and its executives are throwing around all this cash while Parnas still owes that associate more than $500,000 from a years-old federal lawsuit. Now a judge in Florida wants to know, too: He\u2019s demanded that GEP produce significant internal financial records.\n\nThe legal wrangling could offer a glimpse into the structure and workings of GEP, a new and relatively obscure company that hopes to cash in on Trump\u2019s plans to boost energy exports to Europe\u2014and is making hefty political contributions to bolster its standing in Washington.\n\nGEP drew attention over the summer when it donated $325,000 to America First, $50,000 to a PAC supporting Rep. Ron DeSantis (the now-governor-elect of Florida), $15,000 to a super PAC spending in the U.S. Senate race in West Virginia, and $20,000 to a pair of state-level candidates in Nevada.\n\nParnas chipped in $20,000 to Republican candidates and political groups this cycle, on top of the $50,000 he donated to a joint fundraising committee for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee in 2016.\n\nThose donations came even as a former business associate sought to collect a huge federal judgment against Parnas. The legal dispute originated in 2010 with a film project for which Parnas attempted to recruit investors. According to federal court records, one investor was courted with tactics that included a dinner with actor Jack Nicholson. But the film project still has not materialized, and in 2011 the investor, Michael Pues, sued Parnas to recoup his money, provided from a Pues family trust\u2019s retirement account. In 2015, a federal court awarded Pues a judgment that has, with interest, swelled to more than $500,000. A federal appeals court subsequently upheld the decision.\n\nParnas has yet to pay that judgment. So when PAY DIRT first reported his involvement with GEP, and its six-figure donation to America First, Pues filed a new motion in a court in Florida\u2019s Palm Beach County, where he has sought to enforce the ruling against Parnas. Pues is seeking information about GEP\u2019s finances, leadership structure, and Parnas\u2019 involvement with the group.\n\nIn late July, Pues\u2019 lawyer announced his intent to subpoena GEP for \u201call documents signed by Lev Parnas on behalf of\u201d GEP, such as \u201cbank deposit agreements, political action committee finance documents, checks, leases, and operating agreements.\u201d He also asked for a \u201clist of all officers/managers\u201d and all correspondence involving Parnas since April 1, 2018.\n\nThe subpoena requested those records be turned over to Pues\u2019 lawyers by Sept. 14. But more than a month later, Pues\u2019 attorney said he had heard nothing from the company about the requested documents. He filed a motion with the court demanding the records be produced. Neither Parnas nor GEP opposed the motion in court, and the judge granted it. He ordered that the company comply with the subpoena by Nov. 1, and warned that it would be held in contempt if it didn\u2019t.\n\nTwo weeks after that deadline, GEP still hadn\u2019t produced those records. Pues filed a motion to hold the company in contempt. The court has yet to hold a hearing on the motion, but GEP denies that it\u2019s in violation of the court\u2019s order. Though the company is well past the court-imposed deadline, a spokesperson told PAY DIRT that Chris Draper, an attorney for both Parnas and GEP, has been in contact with Pues\u2019 attorneys to sort out the scope of the subpoena.\n\n\u201cGlobal Energy Producers has always complied with all appropriate financial disclosure laws and will continue to do so,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cMr. Parnas has responded to the specific subpoena as attorneys for both sides are in constant communication and working in partnership towards an amenable agreement.\u201d\n\nPues\u2019 attorney, Tony Andr\u00e9 of the Andr\u00e9 Law Firm in Aventura, Florida, says that is simply untrue. \u201cThis is a lie,\u201d he said after presented with GEP\u2019s statement. He acknowledged having been in touch with Draper, but said Draper never actually acknowledged in their discussions that he was representing GEP, and that they never discussed the subpoena of the company.\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d he told PAY DIRT in an interview, \u201cthe last email that I sent to Mr. Draper, before I sent the motion to compel, I said \u2018To be clear, you represent Global Energy Producers? Because there\u2019s an outstanding subpoena that is overdue.\u2019 He never responded.\u201d\n\nEmails reviewed by PAY DIRT confirm Draper and Andr\u00e9 were in touch about the case in the weeks after the judge ordered GEP to produce internal records. But the emails don\u2019t mention that subpoena or GEP at all.\n\nAndr\u00e9 is set to depose another GEP executive, Igor Fruman, in January, court records indicate. GEP\u2019s spokesperson maintains that the case is \u201ca completely unrelated and independent issue concerning an investment in a film, in which Mr. Parnas and a previous entity of his were the only damaged party.\u201d\n\nFruman and Parnas incorporated the company in Delaware in April, and hope to use the company to capitalize on Trump\u2019s plan to export more natural gas to Europe, where both GEP executives have business connections.\n\nAt the same time, Parnas appears to have won access to a number of high-profile Republican officials. He\u2019s been spotted this year hobnobbing with U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp. Parnas and Fruman also attended a Trump campaign event in early 2018 at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nDespite multiple federal court judgments against him, Parnas maintains that he was the wronged party in his business dealings with Pues, and he says he plans to file a new lawsuit in the dispute. \u201cAll legal remedies will be exercised in order to expose the truth\u2014which will ultimately vindicate Mr. Parnas,\u201d GEP\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nThat new lawsuit will be filed in California, and a source familiar with plans for the litigation said its \u201crelated parties\u201d will include \u201cA-list Hollywood celebrities.\u201d\n\nGet the data:", "description": "Two months after a pro-Trump super PAC donor\u2019s records were demanded, there\u2019s still no records.
