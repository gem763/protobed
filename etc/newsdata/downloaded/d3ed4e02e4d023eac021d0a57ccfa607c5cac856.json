The campaign is mature enough that multiple candidates have dropped out of the race but still young enough for the top-polling candidates to bring risk-averse approaches to the debate, limiting the possibilities for fireworks. It was late enough in the cycle for most of the arguments to be familiar to a highly informed voter but perhaps not late enough to qualify as must-see television for the less-engaged.\n\nLittle happened on Thursday night to directly and immediately threaten the polling lead of the top three presidential candidates \u2015 former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2015 and, beyond their now-standard opening 30-minute exchange on health care and \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a brief scuffle on Biden\u2019s vote for the Iraq War, they avoided directly criticizing each other.\n\nThe lower-polling candidates, including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas), all deployed different strategies for a breakout moment: Klobuchar used her corny sense of humor, Harris tried to focus on criticizing President Donald Trump, and O\u2019Rourke had success introducing his campaign\u2019s new focus on gun control to a national audience.\n\nHere are four takeaways from the third Democratic presidential debate:\n\nThe front-runners turn down showdowns\n\nPolling in recent weeks has shown a solid top trio of Biden, Warren and Sanders, with Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2015 both of whom had stints in the top tier \u2015 falling into the single digits. The fact that Warren and Biden, who have clashed in the past, were sharing the debate stage for the first time only increased expectations of a showdown.\n\nInstead, new lines of contrast were few and far between, with all three top candidates opting to take a rain check on a climactic battle. Sanders and Warren teamed up to battle Biden in an occasionally testy health care exchange that mostly was a retread of arguments from earlier debates. Repeat viewers who were sold on Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan and those who prefer Biden\u2019s more incremental push to expand Obamacare were unlikely to have heard any arguments to budge them.\n\nOne answer from Sanders did stand out. After Biden brought up his own vote in favor of the Iraq War, Sanders highlighted his own opposition to the conflict.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what [Dick] Cheney and [George W.] Bush said about Iraq,\u201d Sanders said to Biden. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the former vice president responded, as many in the audience cheered.\n\nBut Sanders quickly let the topic drop, moving on to discuss his work to improve veterans\u2019 health care as the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. In the same answer, he noted he had voted against increases in military spending during the Trump administration. That\u2019s a potential point of contrast with Warren, but he never mentioned her votes to make the contrast clear.\n\nThough all three top-tier candidates received plenty of attention from the moderators \u2015 Biden led in speaking time, with 17\u00bd minutes, Warren was second with 16\u00bd minutes, and Sanders was in fourth beyond Booker with 14 minutes \u2015 all also had stretches when they seemed to take a back seat. Their campaigns are likely to be fine with that. At this point, the front-runners have much more ground to lose than they stand to gain.\n\nBeto feels at home in Texas\n\nThe goal of any lower-polling candidate is to have A Moment, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s declaration of support for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons \u2015 \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he told the moderators. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d \u2015 qualified as one and is likely to be one of the few clips voters who didn\u2019t watch live will see from the debate. It\u2019s likely to generate attention not only because the party\u2019s base seems ready to embrace candidates adopting bolder positions on gun control but also because it\u2019s a risky position for a Democrat to hold for the general election.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who is polling in single digits, has adopted a more urgent tone in his campaign since the mass shootings in El Paso and Odessa, Texas, last month and has put an aggressive gun control push at the center of his messaging. It\u2019s paying off: The O\u2019Rourke campaign bragged that it had its best fundraising hour of the quarter during the debate. It\u2019s possible this is O\u2019Rourke finding his stride. But it\u2019s also possible it leads to a burst of attention with little long-term effect. (See the praise of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro after the first debate for an example.)\n\nCastro the aggressor\n\nCastro has consistently shown his willingness to draw contrasts and critique his opponents \u2015 remember his attacks on O\u2019Rourke in the first debate \u2015 and Biden was his main target Thursday. His attack on the 76-year-old former vice president during the health care portion of the debate \u2015 \u201cYou just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago said that they would have to buy in.\u201d \u2015 is unlikely to lead to a detailed policy discussion and has already led to a discussion about whether the attack was unfairly ageist. (Castro, in post-debate interviews, insisted he wasn\u2019t taking a shot at Biden\u2019s age.)\n\nSure, slamming Biden is likely to please progressives eager for the other candidates to knock the Delawarean from his perch atop the polls. The response to Castro\u2019s comments, even in the immediate hours after the debate, illustrates the risks of throwing punches in a primary, especially when the other candidate has an extensive network of surrogates and allies like Biden does. The debate had barely ended when former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was on national television calling Castro \u201cmean and vindictive.\u201d Expect similar commentary from other Obama administration alumni with fond feelings for the former vice president.\n\nAt the same time, Castro, who is polling at around 1%, was not guaranteed to feature in post-debate chatter. The punches he threw at Biden mean he will be talked about \u2015 something a candidate polling at 1% needs desperately. And another debate exchange made it clear Castro isn\u2019t going to shy away from criticizing the other candidates.\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d Buttigieg said after the former San Antonio mayor\u2019s exchange with Biden.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That\u2019s called an election,\u201d Castro responded. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nModerator diversity matters\n\nThursday\u2019s debate moderators were two white men, one black woman and one Latino man. It was a diverse group of questioners, and it paid off. Some of the strongest questions of the night came from ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos.\n\nThe majority of the moderators in the 2016 and 2018 Democratic debates were men, and predominantly white men. But the Democratic National Committee instituted a new rule for the 2020 election cycle mandating that every debate have a female moderator. It also encouraged news outlets hosting debates to include people of color.\n\nOn Thursday, Davis pressed Harris on her criminal justice record, listing positions that have changed over the years. And Davis pointedly read Biden one of his quotes from 1975, in which he said he didn\u2019t believe society had any responsibility to address the legacy of slavery.\n\nRamos pressed Biden on President Barack Obama\u2019s deportations of undocumented immigrants and asked him why Latinos should trust him. He also challenged Biden when he dodged the question. He then turned to Castro, the former Obama Cabinet secretary and the only Latino candidate in the field, and asked him why voters should trust Democrats to deal with immigration reform since the party failed to do it when it controlled Congress and the White House in 2009.\n\nAmanda Terkel contributed to this report.", "description": "A temporary truce holds among the top-tier trio of presidential candidates in Houston.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b1d6c2300005805526fb7.jpeg?cache=oxw4sqided&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
