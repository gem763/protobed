I could understand Romney wanting a \u201cburner account\u201d on Twitter if he wanted to interact with people anonymously, instead of opening an official account and having every last thing he tweeted be the subject of news stories. But Romney hardly ever commented from his \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d account. He appears to have used his account almost exclusively to read the tweets of the people he followed.\n\nSo why did he need a burner account? If all he wanted to do was lurk, he could have opened a personal Mitt Romney account and just used that without tweeting.\n\nThere was, however, one thing he did with the Pierre account that would have been awkward if he had done it with a Mitt account: He \u201cliked\u201d certain tweets posted by others. Not everyone uses the \u201clike\u201d function to signal that they really do like a particular tweet; many use it as a way to bookmark a tweet to which they might have reason to refer later. (Once you \u201clike\u201d a tweet, it appears in a separate \u201clike\u201d column on your account for handy reference going forward.) Romney, however, seems to have used the \u201clike\u201d function the way it was designed, to signal approval of or agreement with someone else\u2019s view.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: The \u201clike\u201d column attached to one\u2019s account is visible to the world. Anyone can see which tweets you\u2019ve liked.\n\nWhich is where things get interesting. Georgetown professor Don Moynihan sifted through some of Pierre Delecto\u2019s \u201clikes\u201d yesterday afternoon during the few hours between the time the account was identified as likely belonging to Romney and the time that Romney made the account \u201cprivate.\u201d (Once an account goes private, everything about it apart from the username \u2014 tweets, \u201clikes,\u201d you name it \u2014 is invisible to all except those who already followed the account.) What Moynihan found is that Pierre wasn\u2019t shy about approving of tweets that were critical of Republicans\u2026\n\nMitt Romney and New Gingrich don\u2019t like each other. That is not news. Romney once called him a \u201cfailed leader\u201d who \u201cresigned in disgrace.\u201d #PierreDelecto also does not care for Newt Gingrich, as demonstrated by his like of this tweet. 3/ pic.twitter.com/B8oCtzjA9j \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) October 20, 2019\n\nPierre Delecto/maybe-Mitt also liked this tweet about Rudy Giuliani turn into a Batman villain (which one though? I am going to do with Danny de Vito\u2019s Penguin for those who are old enough to remember). 4/ pic.twitter.com/xqqTt4OqAP \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) October 20, 2019\n\n\u2026including Republicans with whom he serves in the Senate:\n\nMany people have been reminding Lindsey Graham that he used to be a bit more likely to find Presidential misbehavior to be impeachment-worthy in the past. Pierre Delecto also liked this tweet about the person who may or may not be his fellow Senator! 5/ pic.twitter.com/RS49CU3Bwp \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) October 20, 2019\n\nPierre Delecto/maybe-Mitt also liked this tweet suggesting that this is the defining image of Marco Rubio. Some uncomfortable moments ahead in the Senate. 6/ pic.twitter.com/QKzABnbSUh \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) October 20, 2019\n\nThe Rubio tweet is especially surprising since Marco was a surrogate for Romney 2012 and a shortlister for VP that year. But note the date of Scott Conroy\u2019s tweet criticizing Rubio: October 4 of this year. That was the day Rubio was asked by reporters what he thought about Trump publicly nudging China to investigate the Bidens and humiliated himself by dismissing it as nothing more than presidential trolling aimed at getting a rise out of the media.\n\n\u201cPierre\u201d is plainly tired of the Trump apologists in his own caucus.\n\nThat\u2019s the amazing thing of about all of these tweets, in fact \u2014 the dates. These aren\u2019t years-old tweets griping about Trump or other Republicans from back when Romney was enjoying private life. He was \u201cliking\u201d complaints about GOP senators as recently as a few weeks ago, when he was a member of the Senate himself. Which raises the question: What the hell was Romney doing \u201cliking\u201d tweets from his burner account, given the obvious political trouble doing so might cause him if the account was ultimately traced to him?\n\nDid he never ask one of his kids or grandkids, \u201cSay, if I \u2018like\u2019 a tweet mocking Little Marco Rubio, can other Twitter users see that?\u201d The prudent thing to do with an account set up to allow him to lurk was to do just that \u2014 lurk. No \u201cliking,\u201d no retweeting, no nothing. Just follow the people you want to follow and read their tweets in silence.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitt\u2019s longtime enemies are opportunistically piling on:\n\nHow sad. A US Senator created a fake name for Twitter and became \"Pierre Delcto.\" Hiding behind a pseudonym is what kids, cowards, couch potatoes, or perverts like \"Carlos Danger\" do. https://t.co/E9ti4dUSZ1 \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 21, 2019\n\nAs many, many others noted on Twitter after Huck posted that, Trump\u2019s infamous use of alter egos over the years to promote himself (in particular, his sex life) has never seemed to give Huck or his daughter a moment\u2019s pause before defending the president at every turn.\n\nAnyway. Whatever Pierre\u2019s faults, let it be known that he has/had excellent taste in Twitter commentary:\n\nAs you might expect, many of the liked tweets are ones that are hostile to Trump. No surprise. But some also reveal what maybe-Mitt thinks of other GOP officials. And it is revealing. For example, this one appears to throw shade and Romneys fellow Utah Senator Mike Lee. 2/ pic.twitter.com/C9xlOhfYqX \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) October 20, 2019\n\nMike Lee is of course Romney\u2019s Senate colleague from Utah. I\u2019m intrigued to see that \u201cPierre\u201d appears to have shared my chagrin about Lee\u2019s callous support for abandoning the Kurds.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, here\u2019s Romney being pressed by Axios about his view of Trump.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Oops.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/m-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
