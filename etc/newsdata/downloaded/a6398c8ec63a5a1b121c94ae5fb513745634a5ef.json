For anything else you\u2019ll have to plug it in using a USB-C cable.\n\nSo, if you intend to use Stadia via a PC or phone or tablet then you\u2019ll have to have it plugged it.\n\nThat may not seem like much of a hardship but it does negate what was meant to be a key feature of Stadia, in that you can seamlessly move from one device to another, playing the same game and not even needing to recalibrate the controller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was an important enough feature that Google demonstrated it live on stage during Stadia\u2019s unveiling but now apparently it won\u2019t be working until sometime after launch.\n\nAnother problem is that all of a sudden Google are saying that to use Stadia you will need a proper Wi-Fi connection and that it won\u2019t work on a standard mobile network.\n\nThis only emerged during a podcast from The Verge, during which Google announced that their Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL phones will also work with Stadia, as well as the previously announced Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 4.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just going to run on Wi-Fi to start\u2019, said Google\u2019s Rick Osterloh. Which obviously immediately limits how portable the service actually is.\n\nPreviously, only a \u2018reliable Internet connection\u2019 was specified as a requirement, implying a good mobile data connection would\u2019ve been fine.\n\nAll of which, purposefully or not, makes using Stadia via your TV by far the preferable option at launch.\n\nGoogle are promising that the missing features will be fully implemented after launch but they\u2019re clearly in a rush to make sure that Microsoft does not steal their thunder with Project xCloud.\n\nAlthough xCloud doesn\u2019t have a confirmed date for its full release invites to public previews started going out this week (so we should have a report on it shortly).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProject xCloud does support mobile connections and wireless controllers and yet you don\u2019t have to pay anything for the preview service. Stadia though is \u00a38.99 a month and only those who pay \u00a3119 for the Founder\u2019s Pack will be able to use it when it launches on 19 November.\n\nGoogle clearly don\u2019t want to be late to the streaming party but Stadia at launch sounds like it\u2019s only going to be a shadow of what\u2019s planned for next year and beyond.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Google Stadia gaming service will launch on November 19\n\nMORE: Stadia is not Netflix for games says Google, it\u2019s like PS Plus\n\nMORE: Google Stadia vs. Microsoft Project xCloud \u2013 battle of the streaming services", "description": "Wi-Fi will be the only way to use Stadia at launch and unless you have a Chromecast Ultra for your TV the controller won\u2019t be wireless.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/google-stadia-main-c8a6_1571395588.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
