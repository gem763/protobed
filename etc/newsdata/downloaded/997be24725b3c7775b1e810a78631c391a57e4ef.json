It's like a joke, like building a banana skin,' Klopp said in his Friday press conference.\n\n'The world at the moment is like a circus, and we are at the centre. I'm not influenced by it. I am 100 per cent sure of the strength of Manchester United.'\n\nKlopp had doubts over the fitness of United goalkeeper David de Gea (above) and Paul Pogba\n\nThe German also cast doubt on the injuries of Paul Pogba and David de Gea, who have been ear-marked to miss the encounter.\n\nHe added: 'Yesterday, Pogba and De Gea there is 'no chance'. Today it is 'maybe', tomorrow it is 'a chance'!'\n\nLeague leaders Liverpool are currently 15 points ahead of their old rivals, with United sitting 12th in the table.\n\nSolskjaer also suggested the visit of Liverpool was the ideal game for his side to kick-start their floundering season.\n\nUnited would take great delight in denying their arch-rivals the chance to equal Manchester City's record of 18 successive Premier League victories.\n\nKlopp, however, took issue with that.\n\nPogba is set to miss the game through injury while De Gea may still feature at Old Trafford\n\nLiverpool are currently eight points clear of reigning champions Man City at the top\n\nLiverpool fixtures Premier League unless stated Sunday Manchester United (A) Wednesday Genk (A) Champions League group stage October 27 Tottenham (H) October 30 Arsenal (H) EFL Cup fourth round November 2 Aston Villa (A) November 5 Genk (H) Champions League group stage\n\n'They said that we are the perfect opponent - I don't think there are a lot of teams who would love to play us at the moment, it looks like Man United are the only team who does,' he added.\n\n'We have to make sure that is a misunderstanding.\n\n'They have a really good football team there in a situation they don't like so they want to change it.\n\n'We have to make sure if they want to change it they have to start a week later.'\n\nIn comparison with Klopp, Solskjaer actually has a better record after their first 29 Premier League matches: 14 wins and seven draws compared to the German's 13 wins and eight draws.\n\nThe Norwegian remains under scrutiny but Klopp feels that is unfair.\n\nMan United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer tried to cut an upbeat figure despite their issues\n\n'I have no clue about his position. It's not important what you are writing, it is more important what the board, Ed Woodward and the Glazer family are telling him. I don't have an opinion about that,' he said.\n\n'I want every manager in the world to have as much time as he can get to bring through his ideas, but you can never compare situations - our situation when I came in to their situation now.\n\n'Man United is a massive club and nobody is ready to wait for success. In my case it was not any different.\n\n'He has to live with that. If there was any doubt internally, it would be bad. But as long as it is only externally, that is not important really.\n\n'I know people think sometimes the manager has to manage Real Madrid before he can take over but that is not the truth. He knows what he has to do.'", "description": "Sky Sports pundit Danny Mills insisted that no United player was good enough to get into a combined XI from both sides  - something Klopp strongly disagrees with.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/13/19882610-0-image-a-34_1571400485496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
