Frederik Andersen made 27 saves.\n\nMaple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly added four assists in the second period, tying a franchise record for assists in a period of a regular-season game set by Rick Vaive on March 12, 1984.\n\n\u201cWe just talked about being patient and not trying to force too much,\u201d Rielly said. \u201cI thought we played a good first and obviously didn\u2019t get the results we wanted.\u201d\n\nLuke Kunin and Gerald Mayhew scored for Minnesota. Devan Dubnyk stopped 30 shots for the Wild, who were coming off a 2-0 win at Ottawa on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely not the second period we wanted,\u201d Dubnyk said. \u201cYou want to try and find a way out of that better than we did.\u201d\n\nMinnesota head coach Bruce Boudreau lamented his veteran roster\u2019s lack of foot speed, which was evident against the high-powered Leafs.\n\n\u201cI wish I had a magic potion to make everybody faster,\u201d Boudreau said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to grind it out.\u201d\n\nAfter falling behind early for the sixth time in seven games overall and the fifth time in five home dates, Toronto rallied with four goals in the second period.\n\nTavares got things going at 1:58 when he scored on a slap shot off the post and past Dubnyk for his second of the season.\n\nThe goal came after head coach Mike Babcock moved Trevor Moore up to play with Tavares and Marner. Kasperi Kapanen slid down the lineup to join Alexander Kerfoot and Ilya Mikheyev.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been watching it \u2026 no one seemed to be going,\u201d Babcock said of the switch. \u201cTried it and it seemed to be OK, so we just stayed with it.\u201d\n\nMarner then gave the Leafs their first lead on a power play at 7:17. He took a no-look pass from Johnsson down low and fired a shot through the pads that Dubnyk.\n\nThe Wild, who will play 13 of their first 18 games on the road, appeared to have a chance to even the score later in the period, but Ryan Hartman pulled down Leafs defenseman Jake Muzzin with Ryan Donato off to the races on a breakaway.\n\nToronto made Minnesota pay 10 seconds later when Johnsson batted a puck out of the air in Dubnyk\u2019s crease at 8:29. The Leafs connected on two of their first three power-play opportunities after entering 5 for 22 on the season.\n\nToronto went up 4-1 at 13:05, when Matthews scored his seventh on a pretty give-and-go with Marner off the rush and scoring on his own rebound after Dubnyk, made the initial stop after an awkward Wild change.\n\nAndersen was called on to stop Marcus Foligno on a breakaway in the final minute of the second after the Leafs\u2019 fourth line and third defensive pair got caught being too aggressive in the offensive zone.\n\nAndersen had to be sharp five minutes into the third on 3-on-1 break. He robbed Zach Parise after Toronto turned the puck over on an odd-man rush.\n\nJohnsson nearly got his second later in the period, but his blast from the hash marks rattled the crossbar and stayed out.\n\nMayhew, who was making his NHL debut, scored late for the Wild.\n\nThe Wild opened the scoring at 5:29 of the first after Dubnyk stopped William Nylander on a break and killed off an early penalty.\n\nKunin got the puck at the top of the faceoff circle and fired a shot that beat Andersen.\n\nNOTES: Mayhew, a 26-year-old product of Ferris State University and a veteran of 164 American Hockey League games, did a solo lap before warmups. \u2026 Dubnyk entered the game 0-4-0 with a 4.56 goals-against average and .862 save percentage.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWild: At Montreal on Thursday.\n\nLeafs: At the Washington Capitals on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Toronto Maple Leafs have made a habit of falling behind early this season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/wild_maple_leafs_hockey_80850_c0-150-3600-2250_s1200x700.jpg?187bc123cc4510feb7f1966081317bdd024739c4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
