Hash rate is a key indicator that elucidates the fundamental strength of Bitcoin, and its steady rise throughout 2019 signals that Bitcoin\u2019s network is incredibly strong at the moment, in spite of its recent sideways price action.\n\nHodlonaut, a popular figure within the cryptocurrency industry, recent spoke about BTC\u2019s hash rate in a recent tweet, explaining that it points to an underlying confidence in the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe explosion of Bitcoin hashrate is under-reported imo. Last readjustment period (2016 blocks, or around 2 weeks) increased 10.38%. We are about half way through the current readjustment period, and on track for another 11.85% increase. Someone is confident\u2026. Me too,\u201d he said.\n\nThe explosion of Bitcoin hashrate is under-reported imo. Last readjustment period (2016 blocks, or around 2 weeks) increased 10.38%.

We\u2019re talking 0 to 100 quintillion. It\u2019s preposterous, even on a log chart,\u201d he said while pointing to the below chart.\n\nIs there any process \u2013 bounded by physical constraints \u2013 that has grown at the pace of Bitcoin's hashrate in the last decade?
