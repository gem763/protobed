Company executives say that if successful, the program could see a rollout to Sam's Clubs stores throughout the US and Puerto Rico.\n\nThis move might seem counterintuitive at first, as offering discount health services presents an opportunity to appeal to low-income shoppers, and Sam's Club has recently undertaken major efforts to target more affluent clientele:\n\nWholesale retailers logically appeal to low-income populations, offering consumers the ability to buy in bulk and save on a per unit price, but Sam's Club has been toiling away trying to change that image for over a decade. And under new Sam's Club CEO John Furner, the company has doubled down on its efforts to attract higher-income shoppers with annual incomes between $75,000 and $125,000 per year. Just last year, the company announced that it would be closing 63 Sam's Club locations, citing a focus on e-commerce and a shift in target demographics as contributing factors the closures. But given that most individuals within this high income bracket likely have quality health insurance that could make such a service redundant.\n\nRegardless of the company's efforts to home in on a new, more affluent demographic, it's likely there are still a great many stores servicing a clientele who earn less than the target $75,000 per year \u2014 and those customers are prime targets for this new initiative. Sam's Club has an opportunity to drive revenue by alleviating the burden of high healthcare costs at locations frequented by low-income shoppers. Approximately 3 out of 10patients in the US say they aren't taking their medications as intended, cutting back or skipping doses in attempts to manage skyrocketing prescription costs. Sam's Club's new service could help address this pain point by allowing customers to consult with medical professionals for less than if they were to go to the hospital and giving people access to common medications for free when they need them. This service is still a stop-gap measure for patients given the limited scope of what's on offer, but it should nevertheless provide relief to some feeling burdened by the growing cost of care in the US.\n\nSam's Club's push into health comes as part of a larger shift by parent Walmart to expand its primary care offerings. Earlier this month, Walmart opened its first standalone primary care clinic, dubbed Walmart Health, in the small community of Dallas, Georgia.\n\nAt the time, we predicted that the retail giant's focus on health services that required a patient to be physically present combined with its massive geographic reach could make the initiative a massive success. Since then, the company has expanded its employee education benefits to offer select Walmart employees to pursue degrees in a variety of healthcare roles subsidized by the company to cost no more than $1 per day.\n\nIt's clear now that Walmart's interest in healthcare extends beyond its namesake stores, and we expect to see the company continue to experiment with how to deliver new healthcare products and experiences to customers across various segments of the business.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
