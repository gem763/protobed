Researchers at International Business Machines said in a blog this week that a simulation of the same task Google used could be done in 2.5 days on a classical computer with enough hard drive storage, not 10 000 years. If quantum supremacy means doing something classical computers can\u2019t, this isn\u2019t it, they wrote.\n\nWhile the world\u2019s biggest tech companies are racing to develop a quantum computer that passes the scrutiny of academics, some products are commercially available already. In 2011, Canada\u2019s D-Wave Systems became the first company to sell such a product to businesses and government labs, although unlike machines being built by rivals, its usefulness is limited as the hardware can\u2019t solve any kind of mathematical problem.\n\nA number of other companies - including IBM, Google, Microsoft, and California-based startup Rigetti Computing - are pushing to create more powerful machines that businesses can use. They\u2019ve also made some of their technology available for researchers to experiment with via the internet.", "description": "Alphabet\u2019s Google says it has built a computer that\u2019s reached \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d performing a computation in 200 seconds that would take the fastest supercomputers about 10 000 years.", "authors": ["Amy Thomson"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/997/ee9fd416d3134097aaed3e975d119c16.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
