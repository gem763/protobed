Between meetings with other world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump tweeted a denial of a theory that had made the rounds on Twitter and (liberal-leaning) cable news recently: that in his now infamous July 25 phone call with Zelensky, he had proposed a quid pro quo in the form of military aid for Ukraine in exchange for Zelensky opening a corruption investigation that Trump believes could prove embarrassing for a likely opponent, Joe Biden.\n\nPresident Trump at the United Nations General Assembly. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP) More\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter had served on the board of directors of a Ukrainian energy company that had been investigated by the top state prosecutor, a controversial politician widely considered corrupt by the U.S. and its allies. After the investigation had ended with no charges, Vice President Biden \u2014 representing the Obama administration, and in concert with other governments in Europe and elsewhere \u2014 publicly pressed for the prosecutor\u2019s dismissal.\n\n....You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThere is nothing in the public record to suggest that Biden was advancing his son\u2019s interests. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said he has such evidence, but has not disclosed it.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump\u2019s favorite morning news show had also picked up on the quid pro quo framing.\n\n\u201cIf the president said, you know, \u2018I\u2019ll give you the money but you\u2019ve got to go investigate Joe Biden,\u2019 that is really off-the-rails wrong,\u201d \u201cFox & Friends\u201d anchor Steve Doocy said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s something else, you know it would be nice to know what it is.\u201d\n\nAt issue was the revelation that Trump had withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine just days ahead of his scheduled call with Zelensky. On Monday, Trump explained that his decision to delay that aid was based on his desire to make sure Ukraine\u2019s new administration was honest. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nA day later, Trump gave a completely different, and contradictory, explanation, saying he withheld military aid because other nations weren\u2019t also contributing.\n\n\u201cI want other countries to put up money, I think it\u2019s unfair that we have put up the money,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday at the U.N.\n\nWith House Democrats moving toward impeachment, Trump\u2019s \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d defense was meant to guide his Republican allies and influence how the public viewed the facts about to emerge in the summary of his conversation with Zelensky and a complaint by a whistleblower in the intelligence community. Trump was laying down a marker that anything less than a direct offer of foreign aid in exchange for dirt on Biden proved his innocence.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at the Capitol in Washington.
