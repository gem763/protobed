Most people would be in bed at that point. But not Dan Callister, a photographer working for Online USA/Getty Images. He was on call that night when a tip came across the desk:\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is at a Toys R Us right now buying \u201cStar Wars\u201d merch.\n\n\u201cI literally couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Callister recalled. \u201cI thought it was a hoax, to be honest.\u201d\n\nDespite his doubts, Callister rushed out to the Santa Monica toy store, making it in time to snap the internet-famous photos of DiCaprio\u2019s toy-buying binge.\n\n\u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had crazy calls, but generally they\u2019ve been serious news stories,\u201d Callister told HuffPost. \u201cI didn\u2019t really expect that call and that early in the morning to basically see an A-list celebrity buying \u2018Star Wars\u2019 toys. I didn\u2019t even know Toys R Us stayed open that late.\u201d\n\nDAN CALLISTER and ANDREW SHAWAF via Getty Images 05/03/99. Santa Monica, CA. Leonardo DiCaprio shops for Star Wars Toys at the ''Toys R'' Us'' store at 1-30 am in the morning.\n\nThis was \u201cPhantom Menace\u201d mania, and not even Jack Dawson from \u201cTitanic\u201d was immune to Midnight Madness, when Toys R Us stores were allowed to start selling the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d action figures.\n\nIt had been 16 years since the previous \u201cStar Wars\u201d film, \u201cReturn of the Jedi.\u201d Suddenly, fans were set to be treated to three new movies chronicling the rise and descent of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, and they were thirstier than the desert planet of Tatooine.\n\n\u201cStar Wars: The Phantom Menace\u201d would go on to become the highest-grossing movie of 1999. It was predicted that 2.2 million full-time employees would skip work on opening day, leading to a $293 million loss in productivity, according to The Wall Street Journal. At the time, the movie was the second highest-grossing film ever, after \u201cTitanic,\u201d reportedly earning $924 million that year and more than $1 billion after rereleases.\n\nAfter the first three films, franchise creator George Lucas had talked about doing other movies in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe, but unlike today, where the slightest hint of nostalgia is furiously mined in the search for box office gold, additional movies were never guaranteed. It\u2019s telling that the working title for \u201cThe Phantom Menace,\u201d the retroactive start of Lucas\u2019 \u201cStar Wars\u201d saga, was \u201cThe Beginning.\u201d The movie was in many ways a harbinger of fan culture as we know it now: expanded worlds, Easter eggs, canon tie-ins, post-credit teases, reboots and, yes, even backlash. The \u201cStar Wars\u201d prequels may not have done it all first, but they made it a part of our everyday lives.\n\nJust look at the recent response to the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d (Perhaps it was telling that Lucas visited the set.) Fans had speculated about the ending for years, hanging on every detail, only to be given a story they weren\u2019t quite expecting. They didn\u2019t think it matched the storytelling already laid out. All those passionate reactions mirrored what had happened two decades earlier with the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise, even down to the fan petition to change the writers. (Never mind the later fan petitions for Lucas to return.)\n\nIn 1999, it took a while for all the hype to reach Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California, the pastoral home of Lucasfilm. \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d was financed by Lucas outside the Hollywood system, so there were no shareholders or studio heads to answer to. For supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, the experience was like making an independent film, albeit \u201cperhaps the biggest and most expensive indie film ever made,\u201d as CNN noted in 1999.\n\nWood got his first real taste of hype toward the end of production, and it tasted a lot like Pizza Hut.\n\n\u201cThey came out [to Skywalker Ranch] with a big pizza truck,\u201d Wood told HuffPost. \u201cThey were giving out free pizza to everybody and the big cups had all the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 characters.\u201d\n\nThe sound supervisor recalls that the crew members at Skywalker Ranch were treated to \u201cStar Wars\u201d cup toppers, including characters such as Mace Windu and Darth Maul. All the characters they had been working on were suddenly \u201cplastered on everything,\u201d according to Wood.\n\n\u201cEvery single something had a licensing deal for it. And that was just that little version right out here in the county where it\u2019s being made. Of course, it was happening worldwide,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like dropping a rock in the center of a lake and watching the waves expand out to the whole rest of the world.\u201d\n\nThose waves were so big, they\u2019d even reach galaxies (and future generations) far, far away.\n\nInternet standom was still in its young Anakin form back then, not yet reaching the Darth Vader status of today. Early fan sites such as TheForce.Net were places to share pertinent updates, false \u201cinsiders\u201d like the infamous SuperShadow trolled the fandom with fake news, and fans figured out upcoming character names by discovering the domains Lucasfilm had registered.\n\nThere were fewer resources but people weren\u2019t any less fervent. Some reportedly bought full-price tickets to movies such as \u201cMeet Joe Black,\u201d only to walk out right after the \u201cPhantom Menace\u201d trailer. Fans waited in line for tickets for weeks, in some cases for charity. There was the first Star Wars Celebration fan convention to celebrate the upcoming release of the movie, the aforementioned Toys R Us Midnight Madness, books, collectibles, Pepsi cans, even an ill-conceived Jar Jar Binks \u201ctongue sucker,\u201d which is somehow more disturbing than it sounds.\n\nBefore Thanos was hot, Darth Maul was everyone\u2019s \u201chorny boy.\u201d\n\nMedia outlets were jumping into the fray, too. With all the product tie-ins, The Hollywood Reporter called it \u201cthe first film that will make money even if nobody buys a ticket to see it.\u201d Variety said it was \u201cthe most widely anticipated and heavily hyped film of modern times.\u201d CNN wrote, \u201cUnless you\u2019re an especially sheltered zygote in the early stages of conception, I know as sure as I\u2019m sitting here that you\u2019ve heard about \u2018The Phantom Menace.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut all this constant buildup also brought with it a disturbance in the Force: overhype.\n\n\u201cNothing can live up to the expectations set by an industry with billion-dollar-lust in its eye,\u201d Ty Burr wrote at Entertainment Weekly. \u201cI repeat: nothing.\u201d\n\nThe backlash began even before the movie was out.\n\nFor every Roger Ebert review giving it 3.5 out of 4 stars and praising its technological achievements, others like The Guardian called it a \u201cstar bore.\u201d Variety said that with all the hype it could hardly help being a letdown on some levels, \u201cbut it\u2019s too bad that it disappoints on so many.\u201d\n\nNews footage from the initial screenings shows effusive fans and critics. Shaq even showed up and said it was wonderful, Leonard Maltin didn\u2019t mince words: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s going to walk away disappointed from this movie.\u201d\n\nSpoiler alert: That comment didn\u2019t age well.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before everything was being picked over by Force-sensitive fans and critics: The movie was too kid-focused, there was too much CGI, Jar Jar was \u201ca combination pimp and Barney.\u201d Worse, Jar Jar\u2019s broken speech and clumsy mannerisms were even judged to be a racist caricature by some, which actor Ahmed Best and Lucas both vehemently denied.\n\nThe \u201cStar Wars\u201d prequels weren\u2019t the start of the trolling or the toxic online fan culture of today, but they did boost those elements into hyperdrive. The pushback against the movie and the characters manifested itself in everything from bullying of the cast to websites such as www.JarJarMustDie.com.\n\nIn 2018, Best revealed that he had considered suicide due to the abuse.\n\n\u201cIt came right for me. I was called every racial stereotype you can imagine,\u201d Best said in a video interview. \u201cThere was this criticism of being this Jamaican broken dialect, which was offensive because I\u2019m of West Indian descent \u2014 I\u2019m not Jamaican. It was debilitating. I didn\u2019t know how to respond.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most poignant review when looking back on \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d came from The New York Times, which said if you took away the unreasonable expectations, it was \u201cup to snuff.\u201d\n\nA more measured take was offered at Skywalker Ranch, where Wood found himself in a position that any \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan in 1999 would have gladly been frozen in carbonite for. He was the first person ever to see the entirety of \u201cEpisode I: The Phantom Menace.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wood, editors Ben Burtt and Paul Martin Smith were each cutting half of the movie, and it was his job to go through the whole thing and find all the moments where digital characters needed to be recorded. But the significance of the task didn\u2019t hit him until Lucas made a casual comment.\n\n\u201cI remember I had this big stack of three-quarter-inch videotapes when I was leaving the office, and [George] was just like, \u2018You know, Matt, you\u2019re the first person that\u2019s gonna watch the whole thing together.\u2019\u201d\n\nWood immediately went into the cutting room and locked the door, jamming it closed for good measure. He also called his mom.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Mom! Mom! I\u2019m the first person in the world to watch this movie!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very, very exciting moment.\u201d\n\nSo what was his initial review?\n\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Wow. It looks visually different. And it was just telling a different type of story,\u2019\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut it was still such a world that you were being transported to, and everything felt like it had a history to it, and I just believed it.\u201d\n\nThe sound supervisor deplores the personal attacks on Lucas and the cast, saying they don\u2019t serve anyone. But he recognizes that when it comes to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d everyone has an opinion and for some people it\u2019s like a \u201creligion.\u201d\n\nWood said that at the time, he didn\u2019t think about the hype surrounding the film. He just wanted Lucas to be able to make the movie he wanted to make, and he believes Lucas achieved that.\n\n\u201cWhen you see \u2018Star Wars\u2019 being different than what I remember it being, that\u2019s an adjustment. But then I put my focus and I made it into \u2018I want to make the movie that George wants to make,\u2019\u201d Wood said. \u201cBecause I believe in his filmmaking and I feel fortunate to be part of it.\u201d\n\nWhile the prequels may have been criticized by the older generation of fans, who were busy putting phrases like \u201cruined my childhood\u201d into the lexicon, for the younger ones, this was their \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to find stories from younger fans praising the prequels. These were the people now starting \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan clubs, imitating Natalie Portman\u2019s Padm\u00e9 Amidala makeup, using those Darth Maul cup toppers. (Hopefully, everyone was steering clear of the Jar Jar lollipop.)\n\nAfter Best revealed how the bullying had affected him in 2018, he received a wave of support from fans and attended Star Wars Celebration in 2019, receiving a warm reaction from the crowd.\n\nThat brought a tear to Wood\u2019s eye.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming positive vibes that came from the crowd were really rejuvenating. We put so much time and effort into those movies and seeing them 20 years later, and seeing the kids that grew up with them are now in their 30s, is fun to watch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of where I was when I came into working in the company. When I started here, I was a fan of the originals. That was my jam. And then to see that coming from the prequels has been really, really humbling.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been two decades since \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d Today, the hype is gone, as well as DiCaprio\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d collection\ufeff, which he auctioned off in 2006. But from CGI characters who might not exist if it weren\u2019t for the early tech used to create Jar Jar, to the ever-expanding serialized worlds of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to the passionate new fandoms finding space of their own on the internet, you\u2019ll find a phantom presence around it.\n\nIllustration: Damon Dahlen/HuffPost; Photos: Alamy/Getty", "description": "Two decades later, Episode I is still a driving Force behind the blockbusters and overzealous fandoms of today.", "authors": ["Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77eea73b00002b88d0c5b3.jpeg?cache=19yjunftdj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
