No word yet for the rest of us.\n\nThe mention of Stadia was cleverly slipped in at the beginning of the event, and then quickly eclipsed by bigger news (which you can read about it all here, if you like). All Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s head of hardware, said on the topic was that \u201cStadia\u201d would launch on that day. He left out that this only applies to a very limited number of potential users.\n\nGoogle\u2019s charm offensive ahead of Stadia\u2019s launch has hyped the fact that it\u2019s essentially a console-less gaming service. You can play Stadia games on any supported device \u2014 laptops, desktops, browsers, some mobile devices. All the AAA games you could ever want would theoretically be available, and you can stream them without loading and with minimal latency (though Stadia promises to be a massive data hog). Stadia comes in two flavors: Stadia Pro, the paid service that offers the higher resolutions, and Stadia Base, the free version. If you just heard Osterloh\u2019s announcement without context, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking both of those would be available on the 19th.\n\nActually, neither one will be available then \u2014 not in the pure form, anyway. When Stadia was first revealed, Google also revealed an expensive \u201cpremium\u201d edition called the Founder\u2019s Edition. Anyone who got this would get a Chromecast Ultra and a Stadia controller, plus three month\u2019s worth of Stadia Pro, for $129. A similar edition, called the Premiere Edition, was announced later. It\u2019s essentially a console without a console \u2014 and that would be fine if it were just a luxury extra. However, a spokesperson later confirmed that having the Founder\u2019s Edition is the only way to play Stadia at launch.\n\nSo much for wanting to free customers from the tyranny of consoles. Google still hasn\u2019t actually told us when Stadia Pro will be available to those who didn\u2019t pre-order these hardware bundles \u2014 though given that those who did only have three months\u2019 worth of a Pro subscription for their money, one would hope it\u2019s less than three months after the initial launch. And we still have no clue when Stadia Base is coming out, other than some vague date next year.\n\nGoogle even addresses this in its official blog post on the matter, saying that only: \u201cIf you were one of the first gamers who pre-ordered and have received your Founder\u2019s Editions, you\u2019ll be able to buy and play your favorite games beginning at 9AM PST/5PM BST/6PM CET on November 19.\u201d Nothing about Pro by itself, just the Founder\u2019s Edition.\n\nWe\u2019ve contacted Google for more info.\n\nRead next: Review: The ILife A9 robot vacuum looks fantastic, works great, and only costs $279", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FStadia-Controller.jpg&signature=1b6963abb9a0ba22b285bfbd9bb3e676", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
