They sat with their shoulders bunched up and arms tightly folded.\n\nThe teen is also the father of a baby, and he had not been attending school, according to his family.\n\nAsked why he had dropped out, they shook their heads, with sadness etched on his mother's face.\n\nThe court was cleared for his appearance in camera (behind closed doors), but there were two other names on the roll for that case - Theodore Loggenberg, who has made a previous appearance.\n\nThe Western Cape police were asked about the arrest of a third suspect, but did not immediately provide information.\n\nNews24 understands that he made an appearance in the court on Wednesday, while the youth was appearing down the hall in a different court after his arrest on Tuesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the case was postponed to September 5.\n\nNjomane's funeral is expected to be held on Saturday.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
