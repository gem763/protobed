The party announced Friday night the candidate for the British Columbia riding of Burnaby North-Seymour had been booted for her \"offensive comments.\"\n\nScheer's campaign team did not make the leader officially available to speak about Leung on Saturday, so reporters had to follow him through the harvest festival parking lot.\n\nIn another YouTube video, purportedly from 2016, Leung discusses what she called the \"perverted sexual preferences\" of LGBTQ people.\n\nScheer told reporters he had confidence in his campaign's candidate vetting process. \"We ask our candidates to be open and forthcoming,\" he said. \"And when we become aware of things that are inappropriate, we take appropriate action.\"\n\nWatch Andrew Scheer answer questions on the candidate vetting process:\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer says he is confident in party's vetting process, despite having to remove a candidate for making anti-LGBTQ comments in a 2013 video 0:50\n\nThe Conservatives this week announced big-ticket campaign pledges on foreign policy and about strategies to deal with gun crime in Canada, but Scheer was forced to spend a lot of time talking about his background and beliefs.\n\nScheer was confronted by the revelation he is in the process of renouncing the dual American-Canadian citizenship he has through his U.S.-born father, and why he had never said anything publicly about it until now.\n\nWhen his colleagues over the years attacked political opponents about their dual citizenships, he stayed silent.\n\nDebate a test for Tory leader\n\nThe Tory leader spent the early part of the campaign \u2014 including a laboured debate performance Wednesday night \u2014 refusing to state his stance on abortion.
