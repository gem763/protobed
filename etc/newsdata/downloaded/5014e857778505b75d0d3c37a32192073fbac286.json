The unemployment rate is 3.7%, average job growth since he arrived in the White House is 183,500 per month, and median household incomes are up around 12% since he took office, even as faster gains (and bigger tax cuts) at the top exacerbate inequality.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Labor Day: Which markets are closed, and when?\n\nThe economy grew faster in 2018 than its norm since the financial crisis but appears to be reverting this year to the 2.3% yearly average since 2009, or slightly worse, with 2% annual growth in the second quarter announced Thursday. The S&P 500 index\u2019s SPX, +0.06% 30% gain since Jan. 3, 2017 (splitting the difference between those who think Trump should get credit for a post-election rally before he took office and those who don\u2019t), compares to a 31% jump for the same stretch under his predecessor, who inherited a crashing stock market. (From March 2009\u2019s bottom, the market rose 82% through this date in 2011.)\n\nHere\u2019s how Trump is doing by some major indicators to judge the state of workers, and presidents:\n\nUnemployment rate\n\nThe 3.7% unemployment rate is the lowest since 1969. As Trump notes, unemployment among African-Americans, at 6%, is the lowest reading among data that go back to 1972. But Trump deserves little credit, because unemployment had dropped from 10%, and nearly 17% among blacks, to 4.7% and 7.7% by the time he was sworn in.\n\nGrade: B+. You can\u2019t fault the level, but the effort lacks the originality of an A paper. It simply sustained most of what was already happening.\n\nJob growth\n\nJob growth under Trump is slower than Barack Obama\u2019s second-term average of 208,000 a month. But this isn\u2019t bad. In mature expansions, job growth should slow as the economy nears full employment. In fact, I predicted in early 2016 that it would slow to about 160,000 a month, so 183,500 isn\u2019t disappointing.\n\nGrade: B. This is the opposite of Trump\u2019s grade for the unemployment rate. There, he lost an A because he didn\u2019t contribute much to the good result. Here, he\u2019s spared a C+ because mediocre growth has an extenuating explanation.\n\nWage growth\n\nBeyond brave talk about work\u2019s meaning, its real purpose is to bring in cash. Something has to put Labor Day burgers on the grill, and few can count on Trump\u2019s $400 million in tax-curated gifts and inheritances from Dad to do the job.\n\nReal median household income has risen about $7,000 under Trump to $65,000-plus, extending a run that began in 2014 after a seven-year decline, according to Sentier Research. It\u2019s actually rising faster than in late Obama times, though the sharp upward movement began in 2014.\n\nGrade: A-.\n\nManufacturing\n\nAt the heart of Trump\u2019s America-in-decline story was his boast that only he could fix manufacturing, which lost 4.5 million jobs under President George W. Bush and another 1.1 million in Obama\u2019s first year.\n\nBy raw employment numbers, Trump beats Obama\u2019s second term but trails the 2010-13 recovery in manufacturing. His 496,000 new manufacturing jobs compares to 385,000 in Obama\u2019s second term and 530,000 from the February 2010 low to January 2013. Hourly pay for line workers is up 8%, too, matching Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nGrade: B/Incomplete. So far, Trump hasn\u2019t made much of a difference. But his trade policies have recently hammered manufacturers\u2019 profits, notably at General Motors GM, +0.49% , and how much negativity trickles down to workers will play out between now and the election.\n\nBenefits/health insurance\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act are disgraceful, especially since he never proposed anything meaningful to help the 20 million\u2013plus people who would lose their existing coverage.\n\nRead: Obamacare is closing the coverage gap between rich and poor, black and white\n\nEven in the market for company-paid health insurance, the biggest source of Americans\u2019 coverage, he has flopped, failing to control annual premiums and out-of-pocket costs for family coverage, which hit $22,885 last year. As the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s president, Drew Altman, pointed out, health insurance now exceeds the cost of buying a new car every year. That\u2019s up $2,000 in just the first two years of Trump\u2019s term (excluding this year), about double the increase in Obama\u2019s later years.\n\nGrade: F.\n\nOpinion: This is a health-care plan both Republicans and Democrats should agree on\n\nUnions and minimum wage\n\nThe minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is nearly 40% lower than in the 1970s, adjusted for inflation \u2014 and Trump has done nothing to lift it. Boosting it to $15, as most Democratic politicians want to do, would raise pay for 33 million Americans, according to the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Trump is also moving to strip unions representing federal workers of bargaining power, while appointing management-side labor lawyer Eugene Scalia as secretary of labor.\n\nGrade: F.\n\nThe rubber will hit the road on Trump\u2019s economic record when the economy, or manufacturing, slips into recession before the election \u2014 or does not.\n\nThe question for voters will be whether Trump\u2019s trade war was worth its cost.\n\nCome to think of it, that\u2019s the question about Trump himself.", "description": "The record is mixed \u2014 and the good parts may not really have happened because of him, writes Tim Mullaney.", "authors": ["Tim Mullaney"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM724_15mini_ZG_20190703160423.jpg"}
