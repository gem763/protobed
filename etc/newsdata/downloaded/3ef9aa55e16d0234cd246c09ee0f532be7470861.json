Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, indicated that Volker went back to the Capitol Wednesday to \u201creview\u201d his October 3 testimony.\n\n\u201cI was never asked to do anything that I thought was wrong, including by the [U.S.] president,\u201d Volker testified on Wednesday, CBS News learned from unnamed sources.\n\nVolker, however, expressed concerns the U.S. relationship with Ukraine was \u201cgetting sucked into a domestic political debate.\u201d\n\nJordan and other GOP lawmakers have said Volker\u2019s October 3 testimony obliterates the accusation at the center of the impeachment investigation.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d claim that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid during a July 25 call is at the heart of the probe. Trump and Zelensky have denied the allegation.\n\nDetails behind Volker\u2019s private testimony on October 3 are still pouring out.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Washington Examiner reported that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is leading the Democrat\u2019s effort to impeach Trump, pushed Volker to testify on October 3 that Ukraine felt pressured to launch a probe into the Bidens as a result of the U.S. President withholding aid.\n\nEchoing other Republicans, the Ohio Republican, who witnessed Volkers\u2019 deposition on October 3, has demanded that House Democrats release the transcripts of the former envoy\u2019s testimony.\n\nSo far, Democrats have refused.\n\n\u201cThere is no wrongdoing. Ambassador Volker was clear. Why not release the transcript so you can all see what Ambassador Volker told us? There is no wrongdoing he was completely as clear as could be: no quid pro quo,\u201d Jordan told reporters on October 8.\n\nSchiff this week said he would eventually release \u201call\u201d the transcripts of testimony provided by impeachment probe witnesses, but refused to say when.\n\nReleasing the transcripts would have already \u201cexonerated\u201d Trump, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told reporters on October 8.\n\nDuring his October 3 deposition, Volker acknowledged that State Department officials were concerned about efforts in Ukraine by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s private lawyer.\n\nGiuliani traveled to Ukraine to convince the Eastern European country\u2019s government to investigate its role in the 2016 elections and corruption allegations against Biden and his son, Volker conceded.\n\nVolker told congressional investigators that it is \u201cplausible\u201d that \u201csome individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence.\u201d\n\nCiting an unnamed source, NBC News reported that the top State Department official George Kent testified Tuesday that he warned the Obama administration that the Ukrainian company that hired Biden\u2019s son was corrupt.\n\nKent\u2019s comments came during his deposition in the ongoing impeachment probe. Based on the NBC News report, he warned that the energy company Burisma was corrupt before or during the time that Hunter Biden served on its board. The Obama administration cleared Hunter to work for Burisma.\n\nVolker, nevertheless, testified on October 3 that corruption allegations against former Vice President Biden \u201chave no credibility to me.\u201d\n\nThe former envoy provided evidence on October 3 in the form of texts to show he was not trying to push Ukraine into investigating the Bidens.\n\nHe did concede that he was trying to convince Ukraine to investigate Burisma, noting that combatting corruption is a component of U.S. policy.\n\nVolker explicitly told lawmakers in written testimony that he wanted \u201cUkraine [to] do nothing that could be seen as interfering in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats, however, cherry-picked and mischaracterized what they described as a \u201csubset\u201d of the texts released to the media to fuel their impeachment agenda.\n\nThe Democrats argued the complete opposite of what Volker testified. They said the texts were evidence that Volker was a major player in pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens even after he defended the former vice president.\n\nThe Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conducting the impeachment investigation.", "description": "Kurt Volker on Wednesday reportedly told impeachment investigators that he was \"never asked to do anything\" wrong, including by Trump.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Kurt-Volker-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
