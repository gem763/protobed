Prescription opioids are primarily used for pain relief but can be highly addictive.\n\nOn average, 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose every day, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which says more than 200,000 Americans have died from opioid-related overdoses in the last two decades.\n\nPurdue is one of the opioid makers, distributors and pharmacies named in more than 2,000 lawsuits represented in the federal trial scheduled to begin in Ohio next month.\n\nThe cases allege the companies are responsible for fuelling an opioid addiction crisis in the US.\n\nFirms including Purdue are accused of using deceptive practices to sell opioids including downplaying their addictive quality.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption On America's trail of destruction\n\nPurdue argued the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, had approved labels for OxyContin that had warnings about the risks.\n\nIn a separate case, Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson was ordered by a US judge to pay $572m for its part in fuelling Oklahoma's opioid addiction crisis last month. Purdue had already settled with the state for $270m earlier this year.\n\nWho are the Sackler family?\n\nBrothers Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler were all doctors from Brooklyn, New York, who in the early 1950s bought a medicine company called Purdue Frederick which would become Purdue Pharma.\n\nToday, the Sacklers' fortune is estimated at about $13bn. The family are prolific philanthropists and their name adorns a wing of the cultural buildings around the world - including the Louvre in Paris.\n\nAs the opioid scandal has engulfed the family, a number of high-profile museums - including the Tate in the UK - have announced they will no longer take money from the family.\n\nThe Sacklers have argued they were passive board members of Purdue Pharma, who approved routine management requests and were not involved with the marketing of OxyContin.", "description": "The manufacturer of painkiller OxyContin stands accused of helping fuel a deadly US crisis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11E45/production/_108758237_657badb4-a77b-412a-8823-09e19da07997.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
