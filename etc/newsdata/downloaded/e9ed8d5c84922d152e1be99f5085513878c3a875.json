Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin clings to $8K support\n\nData from Coin360 showed BTC/USD remaining near $8,300 at press time, having fluctuated around that level over the past 24 hours.\n\nHighs during that period topped out at $8,390, the culmination of a build-up that reversed a previous downtrend at $8,240.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Coin360\n\nSince a sudden dip took place on Sunday evening, Bitcoin has stayed quieter, trading in a narrow range above $8,000 support.\n\nThat range forms part of \u201cchoppy\u201d conditions for BTC/USD, according to regulator Cointelegraph contributor Micha\u00ebl van der Poppe.\n\nFor him, moving average (MA) prices are dictating the upper and lower bounds for the largest cryptocurrency this week. Specifically, it is \u201cstuck between the 200-Day MA/EMA & 100-Week MA,\u201d he said in private comments.\n\nFellow contributor filbfilb elaborated on likely price trajectory in the coming hours and days, erring on the side of a slide lower to test $8,000. He told subscribers of his Telegram channel:\n\n\u201cMoving averages are crossed bearish on every major timeframe up to but not including the weekly.\u201d\n\nVan der Poppe nonetheless remains unconcerned about the overall health of crypto markets. \u201cIt completely looks like a beartrap and overall doesn\u2019t look bad at all if you check this whole year,\u201d he summarized.\n\nAt current levels, Bitcoin is still up 120% versus the start of the year.\n\nAltcoin growth broadly fizzles\n\nAltcoins meanwhile slackened their march upwards, which characterized trading on Monday. The top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap broadly failed to move, gaining or losing up to 2%.\n\nThe exception was Binance Coin (BNB), which benefited from a dedicated exchange-traded product launching on Swiss stock exchange SIX.\n\nEther (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, meanwhile gained 0.5% to trade at around $184.\n\nEther seven-day price chart.
