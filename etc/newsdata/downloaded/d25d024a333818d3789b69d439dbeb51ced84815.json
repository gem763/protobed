Grateful\n\nDo you believe in ghosts? It\u2019s probably a question you\u2019ve been asked at least once in your lifetime. But have you ever really put your conviction to the test? Whether you\u2019re a diehard skeptic or a true believer, the fact remains the same: There are some things you simply can\u2019t explain. And when you hunt ghosts in a haunted museum with paranormal investigators, there are a lot of things that defy logic.\n\nFor those of us who are naturally skeptical, logic is the shield we tote around to fend off talk of things that aren\u2019t tangible \u2014 things like spirits, apparitions, hauntings. Logic isn\u2019t always impenetrable, though.\n\nMore: What really happens behind-the-scenes of haunted house attractions\n\nBehind-the-scenes of real life ghost hunters.

Maybe it\u2019s an ominous feeling that settles over you. Standing in the dark, in a place where spirits supposedly linger, has a way of breaking through any cracks in a skeptic\u2019s armor.\n\nBut are unexplained phenomenon evidence of paranormal activity? The team at Grateful tagged along with the Phoenix Arizona Paranormal Society (PAPS) to examine paranormal activity in a haunted museum. What tools are they using and what level of evidence is required to prove the skeptics wrong? Are ghosts, in fact, real \u2014 and, if so, would they reveal themselves?\n\nPAPS formed 20 years ago to help people struggling to understand or living in fear of the unexplained. Their goal is to offer peace of mind, either by debunking suspected paranormal activity or, if they can\u2019t, by trying to capture evidence of it through modern techniques and tools.\n\nMore: Spooky Coke can makeup tutorial for an easy Halloween costume idea\n\nDolls with real hair and human eyelashes that emanate an eerie vibe. An antique barber chair that inexplicably creaks and vibrates. Mannequins that move on their own. Yes, the museum in Arizona that PAPS investigated with the Grateful team is an apparent hotbed of paranormal happenings\u2026 or, if you\u2019re a true cynic, unexplained occurrences.\n\nWas irrefutable evidence caught on camera? Watch our ghost hunting video and judge for yourself. Know this, though: It\u2019s one thing to talk about a haunted space with skepticism, while it\u2019s another thing entirely to experience it. It\u2019s not always what you do see that matters, but what you don\u2019t.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/grateful/2019/10/29/we-went-ghosting-hunting-real-paranormal-investigators/2491719001/", "description": "It\u2019s not always what you do see that matters, but what you\u00a0don\u2019t.
