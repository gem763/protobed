several Senate Republicans say it would be wrong to hold up military aid to Ukraine to gain political leverage, the issue at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSenate Republicans on Tuesday took a decidedly cautious approach as a White House witness offered new testimony in the House critical of Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid Mark Mellman: Three questions for Republicans Menendez seeks probe into if Pompeo violated Hatch Act MORE (R-Ky.) claimed victory in Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid Mark Mellman: Three questions for Republicans White House: Democrats' resolution shows impeachment is 'illegitimate sham' MORE\u2019s (D-Calif.) decision to hold a House vote Thursday on impeachment procedures but stopped short of outlining his next moves.\n\n\u201cObviously they\u2019ve responded to the pressure that we put on them to try to handle this in a more transparent way that meets basic standards of due process that every American would be entitled to,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to take a look at what the House produces later today and see if it passes the smell test of providing the kind of due process protections that the president and his team are certainly entitled to, just like President Nixon was and President Clinton was,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump and Republican leaders in the House have telegraphed a new strategy intended to move away from attacks against Democrats on process, and toward a more robust defense of the president on the merits of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather go into the details of the case rather than the process,\u201d Trump said Monday before a trip to Chicago.\n\n\u201cProcess is wonderful,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I think you ought to look at the case.\u201d\n\nBut McConnell, a master of procedural fights, didn\u2019t endorse the shift in his comments.\n\nInstead, he noted that the resolution he and 49 other Republican senators sponsored condemning the House impeachment process \u201cdidn\u2019t deal with the merits\u201d of the charges against Trump.\n\nAnd McConnell seemed reluctant to give up the strategy of attacking Democrats on procedural grounds.\n\nSeveral factors help explain McConnell\u2019s approach, while illustrating the tight spot he is navigating.\n\nThe GOP conference he leads is divided over the substance of the charges against Trump.\n\nThree Senate Republicans, Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsMcConnell: We'll see if Pelosi's impeachment rules resolution 'passes the smell test' The Hill's 12:30 Report: White House official testifies he warned about Trump pressure on Ukraine The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Dems shift strategy on impeachment vote MORE (Maine), Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiMcConnell: We'll see if Pelosi's impeachment rules resolution 'passes the smell test' Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution McConnell blasts impeachment inquiry as 'kangaroo court' in fundraising pitch MORE (Alaska) and Mitt Romney Willard (Mitt) Mitt RomneyOvernight Defense: House approves Turkey sanctions in rebuke of Trump | Trump attacks on Army officer testifying spark backlash | Dems want answers from Esper over Ukraine aid MSNBC's Wallace calls out 'chickens--t' Trump allies for attacks on Vindman Trump attacks on Vindman trigger backlash MORE (Utah), did not support the resolution condemning the House inquiry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA senior Republican senator predicted last week the resolution would never get a vote on the Senate floor because it would put vulnerable incumbents and GOP senators who have expressed concerns over Trump\u2019s conduct in a tough position.\n\nMcConnell on Tuesday said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t made a decision on that yet.\u201d\n\nPolls of independent voters are finding more support for impeachment, a trend undoubtedly troubling to McConnell \u2014 who is focused on ensuring the GOP keeps its majority next year.\n\nA Reuters-Ipsos poll last week found support for impeaching Trump surging among independents to 45 percent, with just 32 percent opposing it. A survey from Quinnipiac University Poll last week showed a 16-point swing in favor of the House impeachment investigation among self-described independents.\n\nRepublican senators are also uncomfortable defending Trump on the underlying charge, that Trump held up military aid to Ukraine to pressure its leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE.\n\nThe attacks by Trump allies on key House witnesses who have impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and no obvious signs of partisan affiliation make GOP senators uncomfortable.\n\nMcConnell on Tuesday said he did not want to question the patriotism of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified before the House on Tuesday about Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and other witnesses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to question the patriotism of any of the people who are coming forward,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nVindman testified that he thought Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky was improper and worried about the implications for U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nFinally, if the House does go forward with impeachment, the Senate will be the jury. Several GOP senators have indicated they see their role in the process as serious, and as a result do not want to go too far with their public statements.\n\nSenate Republicans largely took a step back from the impeachment debate Tuesday. A GOP senator who attended the weekly lunch meeting said impeachment did not take up much discussion time.\n\nSenate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Roy Blunt Roy Dean BluntMurkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution Washington celebrates diplomacy \u2014 and baseball \u2014 at Meridian Ball Senators concerned impeachment will consume agenda MORE (Mo.), who hosted the lunch, said \u201con impeachment, it\u2019s just totally up to the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it if the House sends it over, and we\u2019ll see what the calendar in front of us looks like, and whether holidays or the Democratic caucuses or anything else has any impact on how the Senate wants to deal with it timewise,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019ll deal with it exactly as the Senate rules require.\u201d\n\nMcConnell on Tuesday largely dodged a question about whether he considers the House impeachment process as \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, impeachment as a practical matter is whatever a majority of the House decides it is at any given moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the Democrats, emboldened by the new majority they\u2019ve had this year, have been on this path for three years,\u201d he added, sticking to his general defense of Trump by arguing the Democrats are driven primarily by politics and a desire to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\nJordain Carney contributed.", "description": "Senate Republicans, with 22 seats up for reelection and their majority up for grabs in 2020, are in a bind over how to defend President Trump from the House impeachment push.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mcconnellmitch_102919upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
