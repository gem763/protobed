They name-checked MTA chairman Pat Foye\u2019s hometown (Port Washington) and his compensation (They inflated it to $400,000. It\u2019s more like $350,000.). They even hinted at a strike.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBoard members, meanwhile, bemoaned a less-than-transparent planning process, and warned that without more operating funds, no one would be around to drive all the new trains the MTA is buying.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have the most fabulous new signals, the most fabulous new rolling stock, accessibility for all, but it\u2019s going to be running less frequently,\u201d said Andrew Albert, a non-voting board member.\n\nOnce it goes into effect in 2021, congestion pricing is expected to add substantial resources to the MTA\u2019s capital budget \u2014 which pays for long-term improvements, like new subway cars and signaling systems.\n\nThe MTA\u2019s operating budget, on the other hand, remains a hot mess.\n\nThe MTA is forecasting deficits of $600 million in 2021, $800 million in 2022 and $1 billion in 2023. Officials hope to slash those deficits by restructuring the state authority, but analysts tend to regard those hopes as overly optimistic. In the meantime, after apparent pressure from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the MTA has to find room in its operating budget to pay for 500 new police officers.\n\nThat will cost $56 million the first year and ramp up to $120 million a year 10 years on, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission. The MTA contends the cops will partly pay for themselves by cracking down on fare evasion.\n\n\u201cWhere have we talked about how that\u2019s going to be budgeted?\u201d asked MTA board member Bob Linn, an appointee of Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nAs the MTA is hiring new cops, it is contemplating service cuts along the Utica Avenue bus line, one of the city\u2019s busiest.\n\nMeanwhile, the MTA has to hammer out a contract with the Transport Workers Union, which represents subway and bus workers.\n\nTo help stabilize the MTA's operating budget, Foye is demanding worker give-backs that those workers seem disinclined to provide.\n\nIn an ad the union is running on 1010 WINS, Transport Workers Union Local 100 president Tony Utano says \u201cmultimillionaire chairman Pat Foye is outrageously blaming workers for budget gaps.\u201d\n\nUtano goes on to promote an Oct. 30 rally at MTA headquarters.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for the MTA to hear our voices,\u201d Utano says.", "description": "The MTA\u2019s operating budget remains a hot mess.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d5/2c/e776dde0443f97e15d03c68bb958/mta-turnstile-900-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
