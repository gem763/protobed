I remember the sweltering, humid summers, and walking on the street to art or swimming classes with my mom. Street vendors sell these homemade, natural air fresheners made of a white flower called yulan (I think it\u2019s similar to a magnolia flower in English), and my mom would buy them on the way home. It\u2019s a sweet, fragrant smell \u2014 like a combination of a gardenia and Tahitian monoi flowers, which you also often smell in the temples in Taiwan. I\u2019ve never smelled them anywhere else (or even in a perfume!) but that smell, combined with the warm air, reminds me of being a kid.\n\nHow do you incorporate fragrance into your daily life?\n\nIs it weird to say I don\u2019t? I\u2019m always getting sent amazing perfume creations or great-smelling beauty products, so I don\u2019t often wear scents day to day because I don\u2019t want them to clash with what I\u2019m testing out. But if it\u2019s for a special occasion or a night out (I wear scents to drinks, not dinner), I like to spray a scent and walk into the mist a few times, and do the neck and hair. I learned about misting the hair (maybe to the chagrin of my colorist, Aura Friedman) from the girls at Pinrose.\n\nDo you have a signature scent?\n\nI love Narciso Rodriguez\u2019s For Her eau de toilette, but one of my friends started wearing it, too, so I don\u2019t know if I can consider it to be my signature anymore. I normally don\u2019t like celebrity scents, but I love Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker, which smells like fresh laundry, lavender, and pink ballet shoes to me \u2014 it\u2019s a very soothing scent. My mom wears it, too. I consider it to be my mom fragrance. I also love Kai because the yummy, tropical white-flower blend is the closest I\u2019ve found to yulan flowers. And Tom Ford\u2019s Neroli Portofino smells like sun and blue ocean water.\n\nWhat makes the Cut\u2019s approach to fragrance coverage different?\n\nWe love covering fragrance at the Cut, but scent is really hard to write about! It\u2019s not visible; it\u2019s completely ephemeral. I might say something smells \u201cmusky,\u201d but how can I know that what I describe as musky is actually musky? Musk might have an entirely different meaning to someone else; I don\u2019t know if your musk is the same as my musk. It\u2019s like, how do you know everyone is seeing the same shade of blue in the sky that you see?\n\nA scent is normally described by its top notes, like, \u201cit has an opening of \u2026\u201d or, \u201ca heart of \u2026\u201d But who knows what a scent smells like by describing its notes? So with that in mind, we\u2019re often more drawn to the stories behind perfumes, and trying to understand and learn more about the creation process. With all the gazillion scents that exist in the world, why did the perfumer want to make this particular scent? Why did they decide this was the right one, and reject the hundred others they made before? We might not all be smelling the same musk, but we can understand a perfumer\u2019s story about wanting to create a scent that smells like a French rose garden during the day, for example \u2014 even if in your imagination, your garden smells different from what my garden might smell like.\n\nOr when it comes to perfume reviews, we want it to be voice-y. Why do they like this particular scent? What memories or visuals does it inspire when wearing it? How would it make someone feel? I loved Chandler Burr\u2019s perfume reviews for the New York Times and his books about perfume, so that was an inspiration.\n\nWhat were you surprised to learn about Christine Nagel in your winning article on her work at Herm\u00e8s?\n\nI never thought about perfume being a male-dominated world. I\u2019d read dozens of her previous interviews before I met her and knew her biography, but didn\u2019t know that she faced such challenges when starting out in the perfume world, which is very old-school in many ways. But it was incredible to hear her story, and to also hear about the wonderful mentors she had in the past, both male and female. She was so humble and generous with her time, so I\u2019m really thankful to her and the Herm\u00e8s team for allowing me to tell part of her story.\n\nAlso, to hear that her least-favorite scent is vomit. I guess everyone hates that smell, even perfumers who think that there is no such thing as a \u201cbad\u201d scent.", "description": "Talking to the Cut\u2019s beauty director about her win.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/press/2017/04/10/FRAGRANCE.w1200.h630.jpg"}
