Visa was looped into several of the discussions, the emails showed.\n\nWhile American firms often lobby the U.S. administration on business issues, those discussions usually happen behind closed doors and are not made public.\n\nThe Indonesian rules would have required foreign firms to process credit and debit card transactions onshore in partnership with a domestic partner under Indonesia's payment network, known as the National Payment Gateway (NPG). The decision would have hit the companies by reducing their earnings in Indonesia, especially on the more lucrative credit card fee.\n\nU.S. trade officials made changing that rule a top demand if Indonesia were to retain a privileged trade status known as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), three Indonesian officials and two industry sources involved in the negotiations told Reuters. GSP gives Indonesia lower tariffs on exports to the United States worth $2 billion annually.\n\nAs a result, Indonesia's central bank agreed to exclude all credit card transactions from the NPG, the sources said.\n\n\"The U.S. side made clear the National Payment Gateway was a main demand if Indonesia wanted GSP. The U.S. side was dead-set on this,\" said one of the industry sources.\n\nThe decision to exclude credit cards from the NPG has not previously been made public.\n\nIndonesia now expects to retain its GSP status, officials said, though negotiations are ongoing. A spokesman for Indonesia's central bank said its role in the GSP talks was over and credit cards would not be regulated under the new system in the near term.\n\nThe spokesman did not comment on the U.S. pressure. But Rizal Affandi Lukman, an Indonesian deputy minister involved in the negotiations, said the decision was taken independently, adding that the central bank can't \"be steered by the U.S.\"\n\nThe office of the USTR in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMastercard and Visa did not answer questions from Reuters on their lobbying efforts. In a statement, Mastercard said any change in the regulatory environment in Indonesia \"to support global partners participating is a result of conversations between the U.S. and Indonesian governments as part of their ongoing negotiations\".\n\nVisa said it \"routinely engages with governments around the world to promote the value of digital payments and to advocate for open markets, free trade, and global competition.\"\n\nUSTR has long advocated for Mastercard, Visa and American Express to have unrestricted access to developing countries, particularly in China, where they cannot operate independently in the yuan currency card market.\n\nChina's unwillingness to grant the U.S. card firms licenses to operate is one of many market access issues now under discussion in the U.S.-China trade talks led by USTR.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOBBYING SUCCESS, FAILURES\n\nGovernments around the world say regulations aimed at boosting local data storage help protect privacy of their citizens and support legal investigations. Financial firms, however, say such measures are protectionist and lead to higher costs, and also weaken global fraud detection tools.", "description": "JAKARTA/NEW DELHI, Oct 4 (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials, at the request of card networks Mastercard and Visa , convinced Indonesia late last year to loosen rules governing its new domestic payment network, according to Indonesian government and industry sources, and emails reviewed by Reuters.
