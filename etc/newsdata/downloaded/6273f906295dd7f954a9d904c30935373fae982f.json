As the WH letter made clear two weeks ago, OMB officials - myself and Mike Duffey - will not be complying with deposition requests this week. #shamprocess,' he wrote.\n\nThese are the first subpoenas to be rejected in the impeachment inquiry. Other White House officials have rejected congressional subpoenas sent as part of a separate investigation into whether or not President Trump obstructed justice in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nThe matter will likely end up before the courts.\n\n'Your failure or refusal to appear at the deposition, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against the President,' Representatives Adam Schiff, the Chairman of the House Intelligence panel, Eliot Engel, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs committee, and Carolyn Maloney, the Acting Chairwoman of the Oversight panel, wrote in a letter accompanying the subpoena.\n\nThe investigation has heated up in recent weeks with a parade of witnesses walking through Capitol Hill to their behind-closed-doors testimony.\n\nDemocrats are facing pressure to move some of the queries public soon as Republicans accuse them of a lack of transparency.\n\nDepositions will resume on Saturday when Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, testifies. Additional witnesses will testify behind-close-doors next week.\n\nDemocrats are investigating an allegation Trump linked U.S. military aid to public declarations by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he would investigate Biden, his son Hunter Biden's tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma, and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong, there was no quid pro quo, and the call was he had with Zelensky was 'perfect.'\n\nBolton has been on the Democrats' wish-list for a witness after he was revealed to be critical of efforts within the administration and from Trump's allies to pressure the Ukraine into investigating Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nHe was so alarmed by the moves he alerted a lawyer, his former aide Fiona Hill testified last week in a congressional deposition behind closed doors.\n\nHill told lawmakers that Bolton said Giuliani, the president's point-man on Ukraine, was 'a hand grenade who's going to blow everyone up,' according to an account in The New York Times.\n\nPresident Trump has maintained he did nothing wrong\n\nFiona Hill (center), a former White House expert on Russia, testified before Congress for more than 10 hours on Monday. She said she was asked by Bolton to alert White House lawyers about Ukraine\n\nBolton was reported to be worried about Rudy Giuliani's activities\n\nFollowing a 'sharp exchange' with U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who was working with Giuliani on the pressure campaign, Bolton instructed Hill to notify a National Security Council lawyer.\n\nReferring to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Bolton told Hill to relay a message to the chief lawyer for the National Security Council: 'I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.'\n\nSondland, a businessman who donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, is the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. He worked in tandem with Giuliani on the Ukraine portfolio.\n\nThe Times reported that Bolton had a sharp exchange with Sondland on July 10 about White House efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\nHill's testimony followed allegations that Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 phone call to investigate the Bidens, sparking a scandal that has led to an impeachment inquiry by Democrats in the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump in September fired Bolton, who is known for his hardline stances on Washington's archenemies, particularly Iran, North Korea and Venezuela.\n\nHill left the Trump administration shortly before the July call with Zelensky.", "description": "Attorneys for  John Bolton are speaking to congressional staff about the\u00a0former National Security Adviser testifies in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197424-0-image-a-60_1572035638158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
