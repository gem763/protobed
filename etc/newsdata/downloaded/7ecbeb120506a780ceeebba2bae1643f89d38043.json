At the same time as being the most wonderful thing in the world.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018He never got to show his dad his son, and he\u2019ll never get that chance and he thought about that a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It really impacted, and I think still impacts, his life.\u2019\n\nJoe sadly lost his own father when he was a child (Picture: BACKGRID)\n\nStacey explained that losing his dad unexpectedly at such a young age shaped Joe into who he is: \u2018A lot of decisions he makes and a lot of who he is is shaped by the circumstances, for good and for bad.\n\n\u2018There are positives and negatives that have come out of it \u2013 even if you don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything positive.\n\n\u2018Joe is extremely resilient, he stepped into a role of almost being the dad of the family so he gained skills he would never have gained outside of those circumstances.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s made him an incredible person\u2026 But at the same time, it\u2019s taken away a piece of his life that he will never get back.\u2019\n\nJoe also has a 12-year-old son, Harry, from a previous relationship while Stacey has sons Zachary, 11, and Leighton, 7, from two previous partners.\n\nThe couple have been dating since 2016 after meeting in Australia while filming I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here, and welcomed their son this year.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
