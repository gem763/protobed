Although set during one of history\u2019s darkest periods, it seems afraid to stare into that void.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 best black comedy films of all time Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 10 best black comedy films of all time 1/10 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003) The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall\u2019s stores. A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed. One can only guess at how many unsuspecting families have had their festive celebrations scarred after innocently viewing just a smidgen of this disgusting but hilarious monument to bad taste. 2/10 Monsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin, 1947) Hugely controversial on release, the hostile reception garnered by Monsieur Verdoux helped precipitate Chaplin\u2019s eventual exile to Europe. The years between 1940\u2019s The Great Dictator and Chaplin\u2019s most polarising film hadn\u2019t been kind to Chaplin thanks to scandal in his private life and the increasing perception of his supposed communist sympathies. Chaplin\u2019s subsequent feelings of isolation and alienation informed this pitch black tale of a bluebeard who woos and murders a series of wealthy women so that he can support his own family. Chaplin\u2019s satirical social commentary and his character\u2019s defence that his crimes paled into insignificance in comparison with the horrors of the real world found no favour either at the box office or with critics, and the little tramp\u2019s journey from the world\u2019s most loved entertainer to public enemy number one was complete. 3/10 The Heartbreak Kid (Elaine May, 1972) Forget the wretched Ben Stiller remake and try and view a (very rare) copy of this superb comedy of embarrassment and while you\u2019re about it, go for a double header of the oft overlooked Miss May\u2019s work with 1971\u2019s A New Leaf. A Jewish boy (Charles Grodin) marries a gauche young woman in haste (Jeannie Berlin) and decides to end the marriage when he falls for and woos alluring blond goddess Cybill Shepherd whilst on honeymoon, to the uncomprehending disbelief of Shepherd\u2019s Wasp father, Eddie Albert. There are superb performances all round, with Oscar nominated Berlin (May\u2019s daughter), a stand out. In other hands the whole premise could have dissolved into bathos, but May and screenwriter Neil Simon produced a film that is wise, funny and true, and in the restaurant scene when Grodin dumps his new bride, well... heartbreaking. 4/10 Withnail and I (Bruce Robinson, 1987) A British movie that inspired a student drinking game and has its\u2019 many hilarious lines quoted verbatim by fans (\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me with a dead fish!\u201d etc.) must have something going for it, and Withnail and I certainly does. Paul McGann and a marvellously wasted and acerbic Richard E Grant make the most of Robinson\u2019s terrific semi-autobiographical script in this hilarious tale of two base, out of work actors living in squalor who drown themselves in a diet of booze, pills and lighter fluid on a disastrous holiday in the country circa 1969. The whole movie is basically one long bender followed by the mother of all hangovers, (\u201cLook at my tongue, it\u2019s wearing a yellow sock.\u201d) and stands as a perfect farewell to the flip side of the so-called swinging Sixties. 5/10 Harold and Maude (Hal Ashby, 1971) A cult favourite dismissed and panned by critics on its\u2019 release, Harold and Maude\u2019s reputation has grown immeasurably over the years. The story revolves around the tender romance between Harold (Bud Cort), a death obsessed 20-year-old and 79-year-old Maude (Ruth Gordon), a holocaust survivor whose joie de vivre stems from that experience. Critics and cinema goers couldn\u2019t get past Harold\u2019s elaborately staged fake suicides and the love story between the pair, (If it had been a 79-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, would there have been so much resistance?), but beneath the gallows humour lies a rather warm and moving film. Paramount Pictures 6/10 The Ladykillers (Alexander Mackendrick, 1955) Mackendrick was soon to depart for America to make the very dark Sweet Smell of Success and The Ladykillers was his final film at Ealing and a fitting swansong. Mackendrick himself viewed the film as an ironic joke about the condition of a decaying post war England and the breakdown of the old order. A gang of thieves rent a room in a sweet old lady\u2019s house (a scene stealing Katie Johnson), and masquerade as musicians while they plan and execute their latest caper. When the indomitable old lady threatens to reveal all to the police, the gang decide they have to kill her. The gang, a marvellous gallery of grotesques played by Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, and Danny Green then have to decide who\u2019s going to do the dirty deed but only end up offing each other in a series of gruesome but highly amusing vignettes. The movie\u2019s plot supposedly arrived fully formed to screenwriter William Rose in a dream, and The Ladykillers remains one of Ealing\u2019s greatest works. 7/10 Fargo (Joel Coen, 1996) One of their finest achievements, and one of the standout films of the 1990s, Fargo put the Coen brothers in the major league, winning a best screenplay Oscar. Frances McDormand lifted the best actress award for her role as the heavily pregnant Minnesota police chief who hides a razor-sharp mind behind her congenial, homely persona. This quality allows the chief to piece together the convoluted tale of a kidnapping for ransom that goes disastrously wrong. Jarringly violent in places and with an other-worldly ambience, Fargo is shot full of the brothers\u2019 trademark dark humour and lives up to its\u2019 blurb: \u201ca lot can happen in the middle of nowhere\u201d. Chris Large 8/10 MASH (Robert Altman, 1970) MASH fully deserves its\u2019 exalted status as the landmark antiwar film of its\u2019 time or indeed of any time. Made at the height of the Vietnam War but set during the Korean War, the parallels between the two conflicts couldn\u2019t have been clearer. The audience was left in no doubt about MASH\u2019s intended targets \u2013 the horrors and absurdities of war which in real life were being beamed from Vietnam into a weary nation\u2019s living rooms, bungling military bureaucracy, the head nurse who is immune to the suffering around her, Uncle Sam, God, the whole nine yards. The outrageous practices and cruel capers perpetrated by Trapper, Hawkeye, et al on their victims, the jokes and ad libs in the operating theatre while the surgeons are covered in blood and gore, are a coping mechanism, a way of staying sane in an insane world. In other words, we laugh, lest we cry. 9/10 Kind Hearts and Coronets (Robert Hamer, 1949) Alec Guinness famously played eight roles in this very dark comedy of manners and is of course, brilliant, but he is matched all the way by a marvellously urbane and detached Dennis Price as the serial killer who calmly murders his way to a dukedom. The film takes barbed pot-shots at the aristocracy and the class divide and the talented but troubled Hamer directs with a sureness of touch that does full justice to the billboards declaring the film \u201ca hilarious study in the gentle art of murder\u201d. Price\u2019s exquisite voiceover and the savage twist in the tail are the icing on the cake in a film with no room for sentiment or remorse, the pinnacle of Ealing\u2019s wonderful body of work, and one of the greatest British films ever made. 10/10 Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1964) A deranged US general deliberately launches a nuclear bomb on the Soviet Union and the hapless American President (\u201cDimitri, we have a little problem...\u201d) has to deal with the fallout. Possibly only Kubrick would dare make a film about a nuclear attack on the USSR while the Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in many people\u2019s minds, but he created an instant classic in this justly famous and celebrated example of his dark art. Dr Strangelove boasts a wonderful screenplay by Kubrick and Terry Southern that aptly sums up the warped rationale of the so-called nuclear deterrent and has a uniformly brilliant cast, including Peter Sellers playing three roles. It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today. 1/10 Bad Santa (directed by Terry Zwigoff, 2003) The perfect antidote to the usual Christmas slush-fest, Bad Santa has an outrageously profane and debauched Billy Bob Thornton using his seasonal job as a shopping mall Santa Claus to rob the mall\u2019s stores. A needy child latches on to him, thawing the misanthropic alcoholic only slightly, but Zwigoff makes no compromises, and leaves no yuletide convention unscathed.

It is a film that has to be watched time and time again to marvel at how Kubrick finds humour in an unthinkably horrific situation and if anything, this devastating and timeless cold war satire has improved with age and is just as relevant today.\n\nFor Variety, Owen Gleiberman suggested the film \u201cpretends to be audacious when it\u2019s actually quite tidy and safe\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s this year\u2019s model of Nazi Oscar-bait showmanship: Life Is Beautiful made with attitude\u2026 It\u2019s actually a studiously conventional movie dressed up in the self-congratulatory \u2018daring\u2019 of its look!-let\u2019s-prank-the-Nazis cachet.\u201d\n\nFor IndieWire, Eric Kohn expressed concern over the film\u2019s refusal to seriously address the actual horror of the Nazis. \u201cWaititi makes a conscious effort to obscure the ugliest elements of the scenario,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe cartoon Nazis in Jojo Rabbit are so far removed from reality that they make it all too easy to laugh off the circumstances at hand. That\u2019s not only crass but disingenuous\u2026 Nazis weren\u2019t just a bunch of dopey chumps\u2026\u201d\n\nHannah Woodhead of Little White Lies similarly condemned the film\u2019s politics, suggesting that Waititi had made a film that was curiously apolitical despite its provocative optics. \u201cJojo Rabbit feels oddly impartial, keen to note that actually, there were some Nice Nazis Too,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cNazis still exist, and they don\u2019t need better PR.\u201d\n\nOthers were more praising of the film. Matt Goldberg of Collider called it a \u201cwell-crafted, utterly delightful comedy\u201d that chooses not to \u201ctake fascists on directly\u201d and instead \u201cjust mocks the s*** out of them\u201d.\n\nJojo Rabbit stars newcomer Roman Griffin Davis as a young boy living in Nazi Germany, whose imaginary friend takes the form of Adolf Hitler (played by Waititi himself), and who discovers his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is harbouring a young Jewish girl in their attic.\n\nSam Rockwell, Alfie Allen, Stephen Merchant and Rebel Wilson also star in the film, which will be released in the UK on 1 January 2020.", "description": "Taika Waititi\u2019s Nazi\u00a0satire Jojo Rabbit has been dubbed \u201ccrass\u201d, \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cself-congratulatory\u201d in its first round of reviews.
