All our recommendations are suitable from birth, though many feature hanging toys that tend to be reachable by hand or kicking foot from two to three months of age.\n\nChildren\u2019s toys have the tendency to turn your home into a picture of garish disarray, particularly in smaller spaces.

There\u2019s also a bear cushion to prop up baby\u2019s head or for support during tummy time.

The textured rubber dangling toys double as teethers, while the kick tabs and pad activate coloured lights and different musical bursts that play over a selection of soothing tunes \u2013 a boon to parents driven around the bend by repetitive nursery rhymes. There\u2019s also an option to plug in an MP3 device to play your own music through the built-in speakers, as well as a cushion to support tummy time, while the plump mat is comfortable on hard floors and big enough for learning to roll over, featuring a hidden mirror and squeaker and crinkly textures.
