It\u2019s designed to prevent the president from being influenced by gifts or cash from foreign entities. The Doral setup is \u201cexactly what the emoluments clause was written to prohibit,\u201d Napolitano said.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced the decision Thursday. He told reporters during a press briefing that the Trump National Doral is the \u201cbest place\u201d to host the summit and dismissed concerns that the president would personally profit from the choice of venue. Mulvaney said there\u2019s \u201cno issue of him profiting on this in any way, shape or form,\u201d because the event will be provided \u201cat cost,\u201d which would be determined by Trump\u2019s golf resort. Critics point out that the business also will greatly benefit financially from the worldwide exposure such an event would bring.\n\nIn any case, the Constitution \u201cdoes not address profits,\u201d Napolitano noted.\n\n\u201cIt addresses any present, as in a gift, any emolument, as in cash, of any kind whatever \u2014 I\u2019m quoting the emoluments clause \u2014 from any king, prince or foreign state,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) called the decision among the most \u201cbrazen examples yet of the president\u2019s corruption. He is exploiting his office and making official U.S. government decisions for his personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nCheck out what else Napolitano had to say in the video up top.", "description": "This is \"exactly what the emoluments clause was written to prohibit,\" the legal analyst said on Fox Business.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da914e02100000e15ad323c.png?cache=rsv4diuuix&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
