However, what we will not tolerate are protesters committing criminal offences and disproportionately stopping people going about their lawful business in London.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnyone who knowingly fails to comply with these conditions or incites others to fail to comply will be committing an offence and will be liable to arrest. I will not allow the actions of a few to seriously hinder the day-to-day activities of the vast majority of Londoners, or visitors.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International UK called the police restrictions \u201cheavy-handed\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople have the right to protest in sight and sound of their target audience, and we would hope the police bear that in mind when dealing with assemblies in other parts of London such as in the vicinity of town halls,\u201d said Tim Gee, campaign manager.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is expected to be the largest ever day of action on climate change, as young people and adults take to the streets together to demand action on tackling the climate crisis and the human rights violations caused by it. It is vital that their voices are heard and not silenced.\u201d", "description": "Force says it will arrest those who break rules in London, as millions worldwide prepare to demonstrate", "authors": ["Matthew Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db716280c01de75bc0894ab57a59ef6202417f29/0_174_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b47e6b571b23fe83859a7c7358c45c66", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
