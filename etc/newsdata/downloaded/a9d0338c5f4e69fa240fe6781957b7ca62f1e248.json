Putin, a main sponsor of the Syrian government.\n\n\u201cRussia is becoming an important player in the region \u2014 whether one likes it or not, it is a fact,\u201d Prince Khalid said.", "description": "Hours after reaching an agreement with Kurdish forces, the Syrian Army entered a key town near the Turkish border \u2014 a significant shift in the power dynamic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/world/14syra-briefing10/15syra-briefing10-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
