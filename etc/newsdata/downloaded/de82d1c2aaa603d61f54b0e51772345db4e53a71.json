This vaping has dangerous consequences and should be prohibited,\" Gottlieb said on Twitter.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a lung disease tied to vaping has sickened almost 1,300 people, with at least 26 deaths, as of Oct. 11. Public health officials said the majority of those people reported vaping THC products, \"particularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources.\"\n\nBoth the CDC and FDA have warned people not to use vaping products that contain THC, but there is no outright ban, as officials have not conclusively linked the disease directly to THC.\n\nNew rules for marijuana: Gottlieb has also called for a new approach to regulating marijuana, noting in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that a blanket ban on marijuana \"is no longer politically practicable.\"\n\nThe conflict between states and the federal government over marijuana legalization has allowed THC products to largely fall into a regulatory grey zone, and there's no standardized way to make sure the marijuana vaping products being sold legally in states (but illegally according to the federal government) are safe.\n\nMore on Gottlieb's comments here.\n\nAbortion rights groups demand debate moderators ask about abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups say the topic of abortion has largely been ignored at the Democratic presidential debates.\n\nAs such, they're asking CNN's debate moderators to ask abortion questions at Tuesday's debate.\n\n\"Right now, we have a president and vice president who have spent years trying to cut off access to health care,\" Planned Parenthood Acting President Alexis McGill Johnson wrote in an email to supporters Monday.\n\n\"We have a Supreme Court majority that is primed to gut abortion rights. And we have state lawmakers who are hell-bent on banning abortion and shutting down reproductive health centers,\" she continued. \"But if you watched the last two Democratic presidential debates, you wouldn't know a thing about any of that.\"\n\nAbortion was a topic of discussion during the first round of debates in June after several state legislatures passed bans on the procedure.\n\nBut the issue has largely gone ignored in the following debates, despite polls that show voters want to hear candidates talk more about abortion and other women's health issues.\n\nAlmost half of Americans have dealt with substance abuse in family: Gallup\n\nNearly half of U.S. adults say that substance abuse problems have affected someone in their family, according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nForty-six percent of respondents said they have experienced substance abuse in their family overall, with 18 percent reporting just alcohol problems, 10 percent reporting only drug problems and 18 percent reporting problems with both, according to Gallup.\n\nGallup based the results on combined data from 2018 and 2019 across the firm's annual Consumption Habits survey, which it conducts each July. The results cover whether substance abuse has ever been a problem within respondents' families rather than whether it is currently.\n\nFamily problems with drinking hover at or near 35 percent across all adult age groups, according to the survey. More adults under 55 -- 31 percent -- said there has never been a problem with drug abuse in their families, compared to 24 percent of adults 55 and older who said the same.\n\nThe poll also found women are slightly more likely than men to report drug problems within their families, and that adults without a college degree are more likely, at 39 percent, to report family drinking problems than those with a degree, at 32 percent.\n\nRead more here.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nDemocrats push Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders can gain ground by zeroing in on corruption Biden praises Buttigieg for criticizing GOP attacks: 'That's a good man' Warren enters crucial debate with big momentum MORE for plan to pay for Medicare for All (Wall Street Journal)\n\nE-cigarettes went unchecked in 10 years of FDA inaction (New York Times)\n\nSanders heads into debate with something to prove: his health (Huffpost)\n\nAn updated guide to the changing science of flu shots (Stat)\n\nPatients eligible for charity care instead get big bills (Kaiser Health News)\n\nState by state\n\nThe Medicaid experiment in Arkansas: thousands lost coverage, few gained jobs (Wall Street Journal)\n\nHow Newsom's bill-signing marathon affects your health care (California Healthline)\n\nMedicaid in NC is changing -- but not how some people want (News & Observer)", "description": "Welcome to Monday's Overnight Health Care.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/vaping.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
