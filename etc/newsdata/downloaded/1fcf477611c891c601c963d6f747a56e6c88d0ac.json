It had been installed only two days earlier at Blenheim Palace, west of London, after previously being shown to appreciative audiences at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.\n\nPolice said the toilet was taken early Saturday by thieves who used at least two vehicles. Because it had been connected to the palace's plumbing system, police said the toilet's removal caused \"significant damage and flooding\" to the building.\n\nA 66-year-old man was arrested in the case, but he has not been identified or charged.\n\nInspector Richard Nicholls from Thames Valley Police said police believe the thieves left the spacious property about 4:50 a.m. and that the toilet was the only item taken. Closed-circuit TV footage is being studied in the investigation.\n\nPrior to the theft, visitors to the Cattelan exhibition could book a three-minute appointment to use the toilet. This had proved popular when the toilet was on display at the Guggenheim.\n\nThe artist intended the golden toilet to be a pointed satire about excessive wealth. Cattelan has previously said: \"Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise.\"\n\nThe theft also comes after Edward Spencer-Churchill told The Times of London that the toilet would not be very easy to steal since it was connected to the palace's plumbing. \"So no, I don't plan to be guarding it,\" he said.\n\nThis September 16, 2016 file image shows the 18-karat toilet, titled \"America,\" by Maurizio Cattelan in the restroom of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. AP\n\nThames Valley Police Detective Inspector Jess Milne said: \"The artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice.\"\n\nBlenheim Palace said officials are \"saddened\" by the theft but \"relieved no one was hurt.\"\n\n\"We knew there was huge interest in the Maurizio Cattelan contemporary art exhibition, with many set to come and enjoy the installations,\" the palace tweeted. \"It's therefore a great shame an item so precious has been taken, but we still have so many fascinating treasures in the Palace and the remaining items of the exhibition to share.\"\n\nThe building was closed to the public Saturday but the palace said normal operations will resume Sunday. The stately home in Oxfordshire, 65 miles west of London, is popular with visitors and is occasionally used for special events including fashion shows and art exhibits.", "description": "Police said the toilet was taken early Saturday by thieves who used at least two vehicles", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/14/ea3c45d0-7760-458a-8c6e-919b672d168a/thumbnail/1200x630/19c2f9ee38b074e04fc0cbb009d120b4/ap-19257468345443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
