And I used to think that the pro-growth effect of those reforms was enough to balance out the anti-growth effects of the bad policies.\n\nBut I now think the net effect of the Trump presidency is to expand the overall burden of government.\n\nIn early July, my report card on Trump\u2019s economic policy (based on the five key indices in Economic Freedom of the World) had him slightly above a C average.\n\nNow, as you can see, he\u2019s slightly below. And since Republicans in Congress are largely going along with Trump\u2019s policies, they also deserve blame.\n\nI realize that people also care about other matters, such as social issues, the judiciary, and foreign policy, so it\u2019s not my goal to influence how anyone votes.\n\nBut I do want people to understand that economic policy matters. And for readers who like Trump (or at least think he\u2019s a less-worse alternative than Sanders, Harris, Warren, etc), be forewarned that Trump\u2019s big-government policies are increasing the probability of having Democrats win in 2020.\n\nThe lesson Republicans should have learned from Ronald Reagan is that good policy is good politics (my Fourth Theorem of Government).\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush didn\u2019t learn that lesson. George W. Bush didn\u2019t learn that lesson. And now Trump is demonstrating that he didn\u2019t learn that lesson.\n\nP.S. Some of us knew ahead of time to expect bad policy from Trump.\n\nP.P.S. Since my 2016 election prediction was wrong, feel free to ignore my political prognosticating.", "description": "When I talked to CNBC on Wednesday, I was very .09/02/2019 3:13:40AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
