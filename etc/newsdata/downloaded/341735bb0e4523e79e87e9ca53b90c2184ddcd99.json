Where did Fox News snag this little scoop? Did one of its political reporters happen upon it? Did a tipster send it in? Here\u2019s how Ingraham described its provenance: \u201cI want you to listen to some unearthed footage of front-runner Joe Biden from way back in November 2006.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGiven the \u201cunearthed\u201d phrasing, viewers might have supposed that a team of worms pushed the clip up through Washington\u2019s soil, whereupon they projected it onto a screen on the Mall.\n\nThe actual explanation is a bit different: CNN\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski \u2014 of his namesake KFILE investigative group \u2014 published on May 10 a full examination of the 2006 video in which Biden explained his immigration position to the Columbia Rotary Club in South Carolina. The footage highlighted the struggles that Biden faces wiggling between his centrist past and the sensibilities of the progressive Democratic base in the ongoing primary campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAt Fox News, any story trumpeting the power of the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing is a big story \u2014 certainly a bigger story than the serial lying, grifting and country-betraying that is the routine output of President Trump. Accordingly, the Biden-fence piece secured extensive attention at the network. The day after it surfaced, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the propaganda sub-channel for Trump World, jumped right on it. Co-host Griff Jenkins, addressing the situation on the southern border, said: \u201cNow, as we talk, I mentioned Democrats, who refused to say that this is a crisis. ... This is a soundbite that is flashing back to Joe Biden back in 2006 when he was taking a bold move to support a wall. Take a listen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAgain on June 2, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d circled back to the Biden-fence clip. After playing it, co-host Ed Henry said, \u201cSo there you are, he\u2019s on camera and we\u2019ve got the record: In 2006, actually voted, didn\u2019t just talk about it, voted for 700 miles of border fence.\u201d\n\nHours after CNN\u2019s fence scoop surfaced, @TrumpWarRoom picked up the video and packaged it in a tweet:\n\nAD\n\nBiden: \u201cI believe the fence is needed\u2026[because] people are driving across that border with TONS, TONS, hear me, TONS of everything from byproducts for methamphetamine to cocaine to heroin & it's all coming up through corrupt Mexico.\u201d\n\n\n\nThanks for the support Joe!\n\n\n\nBUILD THE WALL! pic.twitter.com/RpYtxtTFIX \u2014 Trump War Room (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TrumpWarRoom) May 10, 2019\n\nThat same night on Fox News, correspondent Leland Vittert pulled a clip from the video. And whom did he credit? \u201cThe campaign\u2019s war room, President Trump\u2019s war room, has put out this video of Biden advocating for a border fence, something not so popular with Democratic primary voters.\u201d\n\nOther outlets managed to do the right thing and credit CNN, including Politico, the Washington Examiner, the Daily Caller and, yes, FoxNews.com.\n\nYet the popular Fox News shows cited above couldn\u2019t be bothered. In most cases, they defaulted to the formula in the screenshot below. It notes the originator of the clip, in this case one Brad Warthen:\n\nWarthen is a blogger and former journalist at the State, a South Carolina newspaper. Contacted by the Erik Wemple Blog, he said, \u201cI\u2019m really embarrassed that the Washington Post media critic is calling me about the worst video I\u2019ve ever shot.\u201d Shot with Warthen\u2019s old Palm Treo, the video receded into seldom-trodden parts of the Internet. Finding it and placing it into contemporary context \u2014 as Kaczynski did \u2014 is enterprise worth crediting. There\u2019s no reason Fox News couldn\u2019t have written a credit stating, \u201cBrad Warthen via CNN.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcute stinginess in terms of crediting CNN is something of a pattern at Fox News.\n\nExample No. 2: On June 13, Kaczynski presented a video from 2006 in which Biden held forth on his views about abortion. \u201cI do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it\u2019s always a tragedy, and I think that it should be rare and safe, and I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions,\" he said in the interview with Texas Monthly. \"There ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus as to do that.\u201d\n\nFox News host Martha MacCallum bit on the footage, if not the explanation of how she got it. After showcasing the prevailing winds on abortion among top Democratic presidential candidates, MacCallum drew a contrast: \u201cSo that from three of the prominent candidates. But this newly unearthed video from 2006 shows then-Sen. Joe Biden taking a very different stance. Grappling with his support for Roe v. Wade, even calling abortion a tragedy,\u201d said MacCallum.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBolding added to highlight Fox News\u2019s fixation with soil, at least when it comes to robbing CNN of credit for scoops.\n\nExample No. 3: On March 7, Kaczynski scooped a 1993 Biden speech on the Senate floor speaking in favor of the now-infamous 1994 crime bill. \u201cWe have predators on our streets that society has, in fact, in part because of its neglect, created. They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,\u201d said Biden. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society.\u201d\n\nThe newsworthiness of the video derived in part from shifting views on the crime bill \u2014 which is now blamed for mass incarceration, especially of African Americans \u2014 as well as the lessons of the 2016 campaign: Hillary Clinton got clobbered for her reference to \u201csuper predators\u201d in 1996. She later expressed regret about having used that term.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsidering that Carlson grabbed the Biden clip months after CNN dug it up, it\u2019s tempting to give him a pass. Scoops, after all, enter the public commons after a couple of months. But Carlson may have had another reason to omit credit, however: Any admission that CNN is holding Democrats to account might cause terminal confusion among his viewers. That\u2019s because Carlson promotes a monolithic profile of CNN on his program.\n\nLook at how Carlson portrayed CNN in late March, after Attorney General William P. Barr released his capsule of the Mueller report. A flurry of pronouncements \u2014 including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 followed Barr\u2019s move. \u201cAt CNN, they were paying close attention to every word Pelosi uttered,\u201d Carlson told his viewers. \u201cTo [CNN Worldwide President] Jeff Zucker and the anchors who work for him at CNN, Pelosi isn\u2019t just a politician, she\u2019s the leader of the party \u2014 their party. The party under whose banner Zucker has said he may someday run for office.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe wasn\u2019t done. \u201cWhen America\u2019s most powerful Democrat speaks, CNN listens with pen in hand,\u201d said Carlson.\n\nHow about Hannity? On the plus side, Hannity in April briefly credited the KFILE team for a look-back scoop on Bernie Sanders calling millionaire senators \u201cimmoral.\u201d The thrust of Hannity programming, however, defaults to less respectful formulations. In September, CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto broke a story on a U.S. government operation to extract a U.S. asset from Russia \u2014 a move motivated in part by concerns over Trump\u2019s handling of classified information, according to Sciutto. Hannity: \u201cNow, Jim Sciutto is a former Obama administration official,\u201d said the host. \u201cHe\u2019s masquerading now as fake news CNN\u2019s chief national correspondent. Oh, let\u2019s see, Obama, straight to fake news CNN. Let\u2019s see, lying and leaking, straight to fake news CNN. Oh, likely guilty of lying and leaking, straight to fake news CNN.\u201d\n\nLiars, captives of the Democratic Party, source of all evil \u2014 that\u2019s essentially the portrait of CNN that Fox News\u2019s two leading opinionators seek to advance on their programs. Depictions of the network on other hours are somewhat more charitable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo it behooves Fox News to deprive CNN of credit for its occasional scoops. To studiously provide credits would be an admission that the slanders of its top opinion hosts were just that \u2014 knowing, false characterizations. Far better to just steal CNN\u2019s reporting. Keep things simple.\n\nBefore arriving at CNN during the 2016 election, Kaczynski practiced his deep-dive-into-the-archives form of journalism at BuzzFeed News. It\u2019s a relatively new strain of investigative journalism, one that vets the vast public record that piles up on the Internet. The CNN KFILE team consists of three reporters \u2014 Kaczynski, Nathan McDermott and Em Steck \u2014 plus an editor. They have needed all those human resources to mine the expansive fossil record of Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972. Kaczynski tells the Erik Wemple Blog that KFILE has constructed a database with more than 120 hours of Biden footage. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched most of it,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s some iron-butt tedium required for this particular style of journalism. \u201cI spend my entire day from the moment I wake up till I leave the office\u201d watching clips, says Kaczynski. In 2015 while at BuzzFeed, Kaczynski and a colleague highlighted Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201csuper predators\u201d remark from 1996. This year, he wondered whether Biden had contributed similar rhetoric to the mid-1990s crime debate. He sure did.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are hours and hours and hours of debate relating to the crime bill,\u201d says Kaczynski, though you\u2019d never know it from sampling the facile crediting on Fox News. \u201cTheir late night hosts are calling CNN partisan and a super pac for the Democratic Party, and then they\u2019re turning around and repeatedly not crediting CNN\u2019s reporting on Democratic candidates on air,\u201d writes Kaczynski in a statement.\n\nThe Erik Wemple Blog has pressed Fox News to comment on these episodes. If we receive a response, we will update this post.\n\nAsked whether CNN has ever requested that Fox News correct its credit-denying ways, network spokesman Matt Dornic responded: \u201cI have not, because any time that I\u2019ve interacted with Fox, even when I provide statements on information they request, they choose not to use my statements, so what are the chances they\u2019re going to change course on this? I find them to be a completely unethical organization.\u201d", "description": "Failing to credit a news organization is more than discourteous.
