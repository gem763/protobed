Citi sees a 15% gain in the stock over the next year as its service business outperforms, surprising investors that have cooled on the shares.\n\n\"We believe lowered expectations augur well for share price appreciation in the coming months,\" said Citi's Jim Suva said in a note to clients on Thursday.\n\nCiti is expecting fourth-quarter revenue of $62.5 billion (consensus $62.8 billion) and earnings per share of $2.82, in line with consensus estimates. Apple said it is expecting revenue between $61 billion to $64 billion. However Suva said the tempered expectations are the best thing for the stock, which is up nearly 40% this year.\n\n\"We expect tariffs and broader global macro to weigh on iPhone unit sell through in December, albeit the more attractive price points on iPhone 11 (vs its predecessor) should help to provide some offsets,\" said Suva.\n\nSuva is bullish on Apple's services business on the heels of its Apple TV+ launch.\n\n\"We expect Apple's Services offerings to boost investor sentiment ahead and remain optimistic on Apple services with Apple Arcade (launched recently) & Apple TV+ to launch in November at attractive price points,\" Suva added.\n\nThe firm has a buy rating and a $250 price target on the stock. Apple closed at $220.82 on Thursday.\n\nShares of Apple rose 1.5% in premarket trading.\n\n\u2014with reporting from CNBC's Michael Bloom", "description": "Wall Street's estimates for Apple's fourth quarter earnings are in the middle of the guidance range but the lowered expectations bode well for the stock, said Citi.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106140318-1568964638555gettyimages-1175821217.jpg?v=1570188484", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
