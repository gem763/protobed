Shell must be stopped.'\n\nThe oil rigs targeted are in the North Sea between the Shetland Isles and Norway\n\nGreenpeace International said that although a ban on dumping installations and platforms in the North East Atlantic ocean was agreed in 1998 Shell has requested an exemption from the UK Government.\n\nIt called for governments to protect the ocean and 'not cave in to corporate pressure'.\n\nDr Bussau said Shell's 'reckless business model' threatened some of the world's most important ecosystems with extinction.\n\nHe added: 'Shell is directly fuelling the climate emergency that is causing more extreme storms, floods, droughts and wildfires and bringing misery to millions of people around the world.\n\n'The company's reckless business threatens some of the world's most important ecosystems with extinction and has to be stopped. For us to have a future, toxic oil companies like Shell must have no future.'\n\nThe protesters tied banners to the platforms, with the message 'toxic waste' inside\n\nBut a Shell spokesman said the company had spent 10 years conducting in-depth research into decommissioning the Brent platforms and its recommendations were the result of more than 300 scientific and technical studies.\n\nHe added: 'We can confirm that two protesters have boarded the Brent Alpha platform and one has climbed onto the Brent Bravo concrete legs.\n\n'Their safety and that of our workers are our prime concern at this moment.\n\n'Our proposals were submitted only when we were convinced they were the best option: safe, environmentally sound, technically achievable, and socially responsible.'", "description": "Greenpeace activists  boarded the Shell platforms to the north-east of the Shetland Islands today in protest at plans by the company to leave parts of old structures in the North Sea.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19696886-0-image-a-50_1571064033390.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
