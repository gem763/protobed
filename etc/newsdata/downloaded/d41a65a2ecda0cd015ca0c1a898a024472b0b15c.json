Briscoe Cain\u2019s inflammatory Thursday night tweet at Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke lit a social media firestorm. Responding to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s oft-repeated \u201cHell yes, we're gonna take your AR-15\u201d line, a phrase many would consider a threat in and of itself, Cain tweeted his own version of \u2018come and take it\u2019 right back at the former Texas congressman: \u201cMy AR is ready for you.\u201d While gun grabbers were apoplectic about a perceived \u201cthreat\u201d and Twitter obediently deleted the tweet for what it called a violation of its \u201crules for threats of violence,\u201d Second Amendment supporters came to Briscoe\u2019s defense, calling the phrase well within the bounds of First Amendment protected speech.\n\nInflammatory rhetoric on both sides notwithstanding, the incident does speak to the dire apocalyptic imaginings of both sides of the gun control issue. On the one hand, you\u2019ve got leftists fantasizing about the prospect of unleashing hordes of gun-wielding jackboots into the homes of millions of ordinary, law-abiding Americans to search for and confiscate any weaponry that has since been deemed illegal. And if the occasional person who feels his rights have been unjustly violated and force is warranted fires back in the process and is killed, good riddance. They were just \u2018Deplorables\u2019 anyway. On the other hand, many people on the right believe that such a show of force from a gun-grabbing government would result in enough literal blowback from gun-wielding citizens that tyranny would be stopped cold in its tracks. Either that, or they are prying the guns from our \u201ccold, dead hands.\u201d\n\nBoth scenarios, of course, depend on a Democrat being elected president, Democrats taking over the Senate, and draconian gun ban laws being passed. All of which could happen, easily. What isn\u2019t as likely to happen, however, minus some sort of Netflix-series-worthy cataclysmic event, is a scenario that involves gun-wielding government agents forcibly canvassing American homes in search of illegal weapons.\n\nEven O\u2019Rourke himself admitted as much, telling MSNBC host Joy Reid on Saturday that he has \u201cconfidence\u201d in \u201cthe people of this country\u201d to follow the law.\n\n\u201cMuch like we don\u2019t go door-to-door to enforce almost any law in the United States \u2013 in fact, I don\u2019t think we do that for any law in the United States \u2013 this is not something that we would do,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, responding at least in part to Briscoe\u2019s assumed chain of events. \u201cOthers have said, you know, this is something we would fear if there were a mandatory buyback program. No, we expect people to follow the law. That\u2019s certainly what I believe will happen.\u201d\n\nMany readers here won\u2019t agree with what I\u2019m about to write, but in this rare case I believe that Beto is most likely telling the truth. The imagined apocalyptic door-to-door weapons seizures that either lead to a totalitarian state or a hot revolution/civil war is unlikely to ever happen. That\u2019s not, however, because leftists are good people and would never want gun owners to be harmed. Quite the contrary on all counts - Leftists are NOT good people and they DO want responsible gun owners to come to harm. They just know that, Eric Swalwell\u2019s nukes notwithstanding, such an overreach too soon has a significant chance of going bad for them, and they\u2019re more than willing to settle for the long game.\n\nMake no mistake, the totalitarian state WILL happen, if Robert Frances and his ilk get their way, but it won\u2019t happen with jackboots kicking in doors, at least not at first and not in significant enough numbers to overly alarm the rest of a sleeping populace. No, it will happen with the so-called \u201crule of law,\u201d as law after law is passed to \u201cstop\u201d a media manufactured problem (statistics-wise) that can never entirely be stopped, yet will be emphasized nonstop every time it happens anywhere in America until they get what they want.\n\nAnd even assuming you \u201cdefy\u201d a law they\u2019ve passed \u2013 which, granted, many currently do in heavy gun-controlled blue states \u2013 what long-term purpose will that serve? They may not physically have possession of your AR-15, or your handgun, or your scoped 30-06 semi-auto deer rifle, but what good are weapons when you\u2019ll be prosecuted as a criminal for using them? People like Beto O\u2019Rourke and their leftist cohorts may be evil, but they aren\u2019t stupid. They know this, and so they can say they won\u2019t go \u201cdoor-to-door\u201d with a straight face and a smarmy \u201cI\u2019m a reasonable person\u201d grin, knowing full well the long-term ramifications.\n\nLike the frog in boiling water, the totalitarian state will happen when leftists are able to use the law to make de-facto criminals out of everyone they hate. Then, whether the proverbial jackboots come to your home and beat down your door now or later, whether they arrest you in a grocery store parking lot or sleeping in your bed, whether they prosecute you for using an \u201cillegal\u201d weapon to defend yourself against a home invader or hunting for food, whether they take your guns via \u201cvoluntary\u201d buyback because you\u2019ve got a family and can\u2019t afford to risk going to prison, or from your cold, dead hands, they\u2019ll know they\u2019ve won. Because they\u2019re eventually going to get your guns, one way or another.\n\nIn other words, when it comes to gun legislation or really anything else, don\u2019t ever cede one lousy inch to evil, godless leftists.", "description": "Texas State Rep.
