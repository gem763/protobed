Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren applaud during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nYesterday, left-wing dark money group, Demand Justice, finally released its anticipated Supreme Court shortlist. Teeming with progressive activists, the list was trotted out in conjunction with last night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate.

Nobody took the bait last night. Not the CNN/New York Times moderators, who didn\u2019t ask a single question about the Demand Justice list.
