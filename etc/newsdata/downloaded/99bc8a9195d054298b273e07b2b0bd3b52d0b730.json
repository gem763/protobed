In July, she said the bloc was not funding work related to boycott activities.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, the EU said it has not changed its position regarding the BDS.\n\n\"While it upholds its policy of clearly distinguishing between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied by it since 1967, the EU rejects any attempts to isolate Israel and does not support calls for a boycott,\" it said.\n\nAccording to numbers compiled by Tel Aviv University, anti-Semitic attacks worldwide rose 13% from 2017 to in 2018. The United States, France, Britain and Germany had the most attacks.\n\nIn a survey last year for the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency, nearly 85 percent of the Jewish respondents said they considered hate crimes to be a serious problem.\n\nCarr said anti-Semitism has become a major enough issue in Europe that many Jews are thinking about emigrating.\n\n\"These numbers should be disturbing to absolutely everybody,\" Carr said. \"Not just to Jews. This isn't Right or Left, it's not Jews or non-Jews. Nobody, no normal person should think this is acceptable.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJosef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this story.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
