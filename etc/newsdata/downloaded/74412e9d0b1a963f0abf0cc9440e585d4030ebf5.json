(FF Lugano) (Claudia CAMPANA/FF Lugano)\n\nThe largest concentration of U.S. soccer players in Europe resides in an Instagram-worthy setting at the Swiss-Italian border, surrounded by glassy lakes, snow-topped peaks and the sport they cannot quit.\n\nSixteen American women \u2014 about two-thirds of Swiss club FF Lugano\u2019s roster \u2014 arrived from university programs ranging from Sonoma State to Syracuse.\n\n\u201cIt almost has that college feel to it,\u201d said Samie Scaffidi, a forward from Silver Spring, Md., and St. John\u2019s University.\n\nAbout 200 Americans play overseas, some with decorated men\u2019s clubs like Chelsea and Ajax. But many are finding their way with smaller organizations, such as Lugano, an amateur side that attracts a couple dozen spectators for league matches and features a team president who operates a wine wholesaler in the D.C. suburbs.\n\nFew U.S. players have had the opportunity to play in European soccer\u2019s premier club competition, the UEFA Champions League. U.S.-dominated Lugano, however, is about to step from the obscurity of the Swiss circuit into the continental spotlight by playing English power (and fully professional) Manchester City in the women\u2019s tournament\u2019s round of 32.\n\nThe first leg is Thursday in Switzerland, the second Sept. 25 in Manchester.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment for the club and for the region,\u201d said Emanuele Gaiarin, Lugano\u2019s president since 2015 and an Italian-born U.S. citizen who lives most of the year in Alexandria, Va., operating Siema Wines. \u201cNow we go face to face with the big clubs.\u201d\n\nHow did the Lugano project come about?\n\nGaiarin, 61, had coached at the youth level in the Washington area for many years and, frustrated by the developmental ceiling for most players, set out to blend the elite skill set of American women with the sophistication of European coaching amid a traditional soccer culture.\n\nFurthermore, Gaiarin wanted to integrate education into the program, with the idea of someday drawing college-aged players for semesters or years at a time.\n\n\u201cWith the level of the athletes in the States and the level of coaching in Switzerland,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is so much potential to grow.\u201d\n\nFF Lugano, which had operated with limited success since 1976, offered the platform. The U.S. players, all of whom have played NCAA soccer, arrive on tourist and student visas.\n\nApartments on Lake Lugano are provided at no charge. The players take Italian classes paid by the club and, if they wish, pay their own way for undergraduate or graduate programs at Franklin University Switzerland.\n\nMost are also drawn to the European lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI love playing here,\u201d said midfielder-defender Lauren Curtin, 27, a native of Northern California entering her fourth season. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, and we are able to go to school and play soccer at the same time.\u201d\n\nCurtin\u2019s twin sister, Cara, used the Lugano experience as a springboard to a pro contract; this summer, she signed with Valencia in Spain. Fordham\u2019s Kristina Maksuti passed through Lugano before signing with Duisburg in Germany.\n\nThe Swiss league is well below the quality of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, the nine-team U.S. circuit that features all 23 players from the World Cup champion U.S. roster and several foreign stars. Most of Lugano\u2019s players would have had a difficult time earning an NWSL contract.\n\nSwitzerland provided an appealing alternative.\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to go overseas to experience a whole different lifestyle,\u201d Scaffidi said. \u201cOne of my favorite things to do is learn, and this opportunity was to learn Italian while playing. It was optimal.\u201d\n\nTwo players are from Ashburn, Va.: Lina Granados, a Brian Woods High School and Vanderbilt graduate who was a member of Colombia\u2019s 2015 World Cup squad, and Ashley Herndon (Stone Bridge HS, James Madison University).\n\nScaffidi started playing for Lugano during breaks in spring semester this year, then returned for good this summer.\n\nShe and Curtin noted the difference between U.S. and European coaching philosophy.\n\n\u201cThere is a greater focus here,\u201d Curtin said, \u201con the technical and tactical.\u201d\n\nLugano\u2019s U.S. players carry a sense of responsibility in representing American soccer, the women\u2019s pacesetter globally for more than 25 years. In a recent match against Servette, \u201cthey didn\u2019t really like us because we were Americans,\u201d Curtin said. \u201cIt was like the United States vs. Switzerland.\u201d\n\nGaiarin and the players hope Lugano\u2019s program will help inspire local girls; women\u2019s soccer has been slow to catch on in male-dominated playing regions of Italy and Switzerland. FC Lugano, a first-tier men\u2019s program, boasts 111 years of history.\n\nFF Lugano (0-2-1 this season) qualified for the Women\u2019s Champions League round of 32 for the first time by finishing second last season in Nationalliga A, Switzerland\u2019s top flight.\n\nManchester City, featuring 11 players in the English national team\u2019s player pool, is heavily favored.\n\nAhead of the first leg, Lugano players have been distributing fliers. A billboard went up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something we are using to bring more awareness to the league itself and I really think it\u2019s sparking interest,\u201d Scaffidi said. \u201cWe want to let people know there is a women\u2019s team. We\u2019re pretty good, so come support us.\"\n\nRead more on soccer:\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico rivalry endures, with more reps and lower stakes\n\nBefore a record crowd in victory tour, USWNT delivers 4-0 victory\n\nJerry Brewer: Carli Lloyd doesn\u2019t need the NFL to prove anything.", "description": "FF Lugano, with a team president who operates a wine wholesaler in the D.C. suburbs, becomes a destination for American women.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
