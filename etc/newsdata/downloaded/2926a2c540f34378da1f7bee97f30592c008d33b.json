He gave no timeframe for when imports could start.\n\n\"(Retail prices) will be maybe double the amount because we are paying half the amount that we are supposed to pay for electricity,\" Nkhuwa said.\n\nZambia, which has been rationing power after a severe drought hit its hydropower sector, has historically priced electricity below the cost of production via subsidies. Only in recent years has the country started gradually to raise prices.\n\nIn 2017, Zambia's energy regulator approved a 75% price hike for electricity retail consumers and introduced a flat 9.30 U.S. cents/kilowatt hour (kWh) tariff for mining companies.\n\nNkhuwa said the government also planned to send a delegation to Mozambique to negotiate a new power-purchase agreement.\n\nZambia cut its economic growth forecast to around 2% for 2019, from an estimated 4%, due to the impact of the drought on its power supply and agricultural production.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Zambia may import 300 MW of power from S.Africa, prices could double - minister", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/STOCK-EXCHANGE-RUSSIAN-TRADING-SYSTEMS_800x533_L_1414427815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
