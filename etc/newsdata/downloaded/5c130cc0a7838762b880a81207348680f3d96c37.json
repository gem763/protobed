Open carry legislation is currently on the books in more than 26 states, Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs, said during a call with members of the media.\n\nWalmart said it won't be changing its policy for customers who have permits for concealed carry. And it will be adding signage to stores in the coming weeks to communicate the updates.\n\n\"We believe the opportunity for someone to misinterpret a situation, even in open carry states, could lead to tragic results,\" CEO Doug McMillon said in a memo distributed to employees. \"We hope that everyone will understand the circumstances that led to this new policy and will respect the concerns of their fellow shoppers and our associates.\"\n\nShares of gun and ammunition makers added to losses earlier in the day. Vista Outdoor's stock closed down 6%. Smith & Wesson parent company American Outdoor Brands' stock fell nearly 4.5%. Sturm Ruger & Company shares closed down 0.6%. Walmart shares ended the day up 0.3%.\n\n\"We've also been listening to a lot of people inside and outside our company as we think about the role we can play in helping to make the country safer,\" the CEO added. \"It's clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable.\"\n\nMcMillon said he will also be sending letters to the White House and congressional leaders, asking for action on \"common sense measures.\" He's calling on the government to \"strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger.\"\n\n\"Congress and the administration should act,\" he said.\n\nThe National Rifle Association of America, a gun rights advocacy group, responded to the announced changes by saying \"lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nSome politicians saw this as a moment to push their own agendas. Presidential contender Beto O'Rourke praised Walmart's decision but said the move wasn't enough. \"We can't rely on corporations to stop gun violence,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on her Twitter account that this was a \"good start \u2014 but it's not nearly enough. Walmart can and should do much more. And we need real gun reform, now.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, also took to Twitter to say: \"I applaud the brave Walmart workers who called on the company to stop selling guns. This is a good step, but we still have a gun violence crisis.\"", "description": "Walmart is also asking shoppers to no longer openly carry firearms in stores, in states where \"open carry\" is allowed.", "authors": ["Lauren Thomas"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106067293-1565228697035gettyimages-1160068261.jpg?v=1566554454"}
