They may have referenced his conciliatory first speech as prime minister. Or they would have cited then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who celebrated Mugabe nine years into his rule, in 1989, saying \u201cwe share your sense of pride in your success.\u201d\n\nThatcher cast Mugabe as a role model for other countries in Africa emerging from colonial rule.\n\nHere are four reasons Mugabe had initially inspired hope, before becoming widely loathed both at home and abroad:\n\nReconciliation pledge after a protracted civil war\n\nIn his early years, Mugabe earned the respect of his supporters through a years-long fight for independence from Britain. Zimbabweans eventually achieved that goal and in 1980, Mugabe\u2019s party won the first democratic elections in what was then still Southern Rhodesia. Newly-inaugurated Prime Minister Mugabe pledged that reconciliation would become a cornerstone of his policies going forward.\n\n\u201cThe wrongs of the past must now stand forgiven and forgotten \u2026 If yesterday you hated me, today you cannot avoid the love that binds you to me and me to you,\u201d he said, but added an ominous warning that later gained a new meaning. If \u201cthe open hand of reconciliation\u201d was rejected, he threatened, it may \u201cturn into a clenched fist.\u201d\n\nInitially, international observers were heartened by the conciliatory part of this pledge, which came after a bloody guerrilla war in which at least 30,000 were killed. Abroad, Mugabe\u2019s promises were seen as a role model for other countries, including Angola.\n\nBut Mugabe\u2019s references to the \u201clove that binds you to me and me to you\u201d soon met reality. In the following years, the increasingly authoritarian Mugabe and his backers relied on an expanded security apparatus \u2014 first set up by their former colonial rulers \u2014 to torture and kill opponents. As early as in 1982, critics described beatings, sexual violence and executions by government troops against dissidents in the Matabeleland region.\n\nLater on, Mugabe even turned the distribution of food aid into a political weapon: Opponents were cut off from supplies and loyalists were rewarded instead.\n\nEnding white minority rule after an anti-colonial struggle\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s independence in 1980 ended an era of white minority rule over a predominantly Black nation. But it wasn\u2019t the first declaration of independence. In 1965, former prime minister Ian Smith had become the first to declare Southern Rhodesia independent, even if it was for very different reasons.\n\nBy cutting ties to Britain, Smith believed that he might be able to preserve the territory\u2019s white minority rule \u2014 even as anti-colonial and African nationalist forces gained strength. But Smith\u2019s efforts were doomed and they ultimately triggered the civil war that ended with Mugabe ascending to power.\n\nTo many Black residents, Mugabe\u2019s rise to the top office at the time inspired hope. Even though Mugabe asked for patience, he vowed \u201cmeaningful change to the lives of the majority of the people,\u201d while insisting that he would preserve the rights of the minority white population.\n\nRelative social and economic stability\n\nA Washington Post dispatch fourteen years into Mugabe\u2019s rule said that Zimbabwe\u2019s black majority had indeed \u201cattained political power, pride and legal equality, and has done so with a remarkable absence of rancor and retribution given the long and cruel history of white-minority rule.\u201d\n\nDespite the economy being \u201cdogged by inflation and the legacy of socialist mismanagement,\u201d the report still found an \u201cAfrican success story\u201d in a Zimbabwe that was \u201cclean and safe\u201d and \u201cat peace.\"\n\nAs neighboring countries were plagued by famine and crisis, Zimbabwe managed to remain stable. \u201cWhen one reads about what is happening in other places, we seem to have a near-perfect situation here,\u201d Emerson Zhou, then-chief economist with the Zimbabwe Farmers Union, told The Post at the time.\n\nBut Mugabe had never been a real democrat, and his political maneuvers took increasingly authoritarian turns, which eventually triggered sanctions. The country\u2019s fragile economy was thrown into turmoil amid hyperinflation, hunger and spreading diseases \u2014 but Mugabe refused to take responsibility and instead circulated conspiracy theories about foreigners being behind the downturn.\n\nThe situation worsened in the early 2000s, amid a Mugabe-led campaign to seize properties owned by the group most easily associated with foreign influence: Zimbabwe\u2019s minority white population. The takeover of farmland by inexperienced owners resulted in a plummeting of food production, which worsened shortages in the country and drew global condemnations.\n\nHealth and education programs\n\nThose steps also undid years of progress on other fronts, notably health and education. Only five years into his rule, Zimbabwe had become a nation close to achieving free public health care and universal primary education. Hundreds of new clinics had been opened under Mugabe, a self-declared Marxist. Meanwhile, the number of schools in the country doubled; the budget more than tripled.\n\nMugabe\u2019s government vowed to tackle racial segregation and inequality in schools \u2014 a relic of the white minority rule \u2014 but it soon saw itself confronted with other problems, including a rural-urban divide, surging costs and a shortage in qualified personnel.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s early problems in the mid-1980s paled in comparison to what the country later faced, however, as Mugabe\u2019s moves led to disastrous impoverishment that lingered until he was eventually ousted following a military coup in 2017.\n\nEven in death, Mugabe continues to divide public opinion.\n\nFor Zimbabwean salesman Tonderai Shuro, Mugabe\u2019s legacy is not that of a liberator.\n\n\u201cI blame him for all the mess that we are in,\u201d Shuro said on Friday.\n\nOn social media, many argued that his policies had resulted in mass displacement, a deadly collapse of the health care system and political violence.\n\nBut some still held positive views of Mugabe, whose hard line stance against the West won him some support even in his final years.\n\n\u201cHe is a true revolutionary, an icon and liberator in Zimbabwe and the whole of Africa,\u201d said businessman Taurayi Mudzwiti. \u201cHe was a champion of black economic empowerment and gave the locals business opportunities which were originally in the hands of the whites.\"\n\nIn a response on Facebook, Zimbabwean academic Admire Mare acknowledged that Mugabe had \u201cexhibited some kind of solid and visionary leadership in his early years of rule,\u201d but added that he \u201ccreated a vicious system\u201d \u2014 leaving behind \u201ccontradictory legacies.\u201d\n\n\u201cA liberator to some, a ruinous dictator to others,\u201d wrote Zimbabwean journalist Brezh Malaba on Twitter.\n\nNoack reported from Berlin.\n\nRead more:\n\nRobert Mugabe, Zimbabwean leader who helped liberate and destroy his country, dies at 95", "description": "\u201cA liberator to some, a ruinous dictator to others,\" wrote one Zimbabwean journalist.", "authors": ["Tatenda Chitagu", "Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OMAVE6WQYYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
