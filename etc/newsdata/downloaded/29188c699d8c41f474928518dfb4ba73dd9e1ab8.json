Last month, sources told CBC News the RCMP were compiling daily threat reports on online hate targeting federal political leaders during the election campaign, fearing it could spill over into real-world violence.\n\nSenior Liberal sources tell CBC, Justin Trudeau was wearing a bullet proof vest on stage for tonight\u2019s rally, after a security threat. <br>He was delayed by 1.5 hours and much heavier security around him once on stage.
