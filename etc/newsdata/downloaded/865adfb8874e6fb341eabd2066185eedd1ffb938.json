Bernie Sanders (D-VT) accused President Donald Trump of enriching himself while serving in the White House on Tuesday, but he refused to address similar claims made about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s youngest son, Hunter.\n\nSanders was asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper at the fourth Democrat presidential primary debate in Ohio if he believed Trump\u2019s conduct in office warranted impeachment. The senator responded by claiming there was \u201cno choice\u201d but to impeach the president because of alleged violations of the emoluments clause.\n\nDespite the bold stance, Sanders opted against extending his attack on \u201ccorruption\u201d in Washington, D.C. to the former vice president, whose son is at the center of the newly launched impeachment inquiry. At the center of the inquiry is a conversation the president had with the Ukrainian government suggesting they probe how the younger Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden was appointed to the oil and gas giant\u2019s board, a position which paid as much as $83,000 per month, in 2014, around the same time his father was made the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine.\n\nEven though the former vice president\u2019s campaign has defended such dealings, Hunter Biden, himself, expressed regret for his \u201cpoor judgement\u201d during an interview with ABC News over the weekend.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\u2019t believe now, when I look back on it, I know \u2026 [I] did nothing wrong at all,\u201d the younger Biden said. \u201cHowever, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is, its a swamp in many ways? Yeah.\u201d", "description": "Bernie Sanders accused President Trump of enriching himself in office, but refused to address similar claims made about Joe Biden\u2019s son.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bernie-Ohio-Debate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
