U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were up 0.1% at $1,491.40.\n\n\u201cWe seem to be at a bit of an equilibrium around here, stuck between $1,480 and $1,520. If the Fed is more dovish in their outlook, it could be enough to drive gold higher,\u201d said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.\n\nInvestors expect the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third time this year, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nHowever, only about a 30% chance of another cut in December has been priced in, compared with about 70% earlier this month.\n\nMuted movement in Asian equities on Wednesday also aided gold, with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS down 0.16% from Tuesday\u2019s three-month high on reports that an interim U.S.-China trade agreement might be delayed.\n\nThe more than 15-month trade spat between the world\u2019s two largest economies has roiled financial markets around the globe, making them sensitive to the slightest development negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe market is very range-bound with the FOMC (meeting outcome) around the corner,\u201d said Nicholas Frappell, global general manager at ABC Bullion, adding that the potential delay in a Sino-U.S. trade agreement is supporting gold and is expected to do so for some time.\n\nFears of a possible global recession and economic slowdown has lent support to bullion. Data released on Tuesday showed that U.S. consumer confidence fell for a third straight month in October.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, Britain is set to hold a December election after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from parliament on Tuesday for an early ballot aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock.\n\nSpot gold could test a support at $1,480 an ounce, with a good chance of breaking below this level and falling to the Oct. 1 low of $1,458.50, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.\n\nOther precious metals were subdued, with silver XAG= steady at $17.80 an ounce while platinum XPT= dipped 0.4% to $916.78 and palladium XPD= firmed by 0.4% to $1,788.52.", "description": "Gold moved in a narrow range on Wednesday as cautious investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates later in the day while weak equities lent support.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446367109&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T032", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
