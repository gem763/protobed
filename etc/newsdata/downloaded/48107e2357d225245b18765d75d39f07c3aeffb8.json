Still, should the lawsuit go in the consumer group's favor, compensation of only a few pounds each could still result in a damages bill worth millions of pounds.\n\nTechRepublic: How to quickly deploy a honeypot with Kali Linux\n\nIn 2013, the tech giant paid $17 million to settle claims made by 37 US states relating to the same Safari workaround. The states claimed that the Safari workaround was used to install cookies on browsers between 2011 and 2012 without permission, and also accused Google of misleading individuals by saying that default Safari settings were enough to prevent tracking.\n\nGoogle said at the time that the bypass was accidental. After the settlement was agreed, Google submitted to demands that cookies should not be installed on user browsers without consent, and Apple patched the Safari browser to prevent the loophole from working.\n\nGoogle intends to ask the UK's highest court for permission to appeal and told the publication that the lawsuit should be dismissed.\n\n\"This case relates to events that took place nearly a decade ago and that we addressed at the time,\" a Google spokesperson said.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
