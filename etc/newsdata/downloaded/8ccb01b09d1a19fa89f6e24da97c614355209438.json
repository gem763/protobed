But like a phoenix, it has risen from the ashes, and has erected something quite special.\n\nThe iconic boutique hotel on Cape Town's Chapman\u2019s Peak Drive has been closed since February, but is now ready to invite you in with the biggest smile.\n\nHugging the Atlantic Ocean at the very base of Table Mountain National Park, across the bay from Hout Bay, is this exclusive escape. With 10 ocean-facing, luxury rooms - each with their own veranda - are all decorated to celebrate different islands of the world (I stayed in Lamu, a Kenyan island).\n\nThe hotel is an environmentally conscious space, with a very light carbon footprint.\n\nREAD: Sunburn, safaris and hearty helpings of heartburn: Overindulgence in the bushveld\n\nFalling in love with Tintswalo Atlantic is so easy. It's like being in a bubble. One you hope will never pop.\n\n(The luxury rooms. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\nYou wake up with the sound of waves breaking mere meters away from your bed. You left the sliding door open as you slept, because here, you are safe. No danger, no mosquitoes - cocooned in a world that is filled with only bliss.\n\n(Right by the Atlantic Ocean. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\n(Private veranda. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\nYou grab your partner's hand and head out to watch the sun rise over the mountains, as you sip your coffee and wonder why you are this lucky. My Imposter syndrome was at an all-time high this morning. But the love bubble's structure only grows stronger as the day progressed. No sign of popping. Like a crush that quickly turns into love.\n\n(Views of Hout Bay. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\nBreakfast, lunch, dinner, sundowners and canapes, and repeat. 'Spoiling you' is Tintswalo Atlantic's love language. Want a glass of MCC at the pool? A bottle? Snacks in your room? Custom mini bar? You got it.\n\nExpect courses upon courses of taste-bud euphoria - the ultimate in love bites.\n\nWATCH: See the other Big 5 at the Waterberg's Lapalala Wilderness\n\n\n\nLater in the day you dip your winter body into the semi-heated pool overlooking the freezing ocean. There is an outdoor bed, a luxurious cloud for sunbathing. As a couple, you sink your heads into the cushions and as the sun shines its warmth upon your faces, you float up, up and away, like a drone. It is an almost out of body experience.\n\nSipping wine, seeing the beauty in all the nature which surrounds every inch of this place, and every bit of your existence here, you are grateful. Not only for being here, but for being here with someone you love.\n\n(The pool. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\n(Wine by the pool.
