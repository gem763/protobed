USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Los Angeles Dodgers won 106 games during the regular season just so they could play a deciding game in the playoffs in front of their home fans.\n\nThat moment comes on Wednesday, when they host the Washington Nationals in Game 5 of the National League Division Series.\n\nThe Dodgers had a chance to close things out on the road, but the Nationals came through with a 6-1 victory Monday night to even the series at two games apiece.\n\n\u201cWe were prepared to go all five,\u201d rookie catcher Will Smith said as players filed out of a subdued Dodger clubhouse. \u201cWe\u2019re still liking our chances.\u201d\n\nNLDS: Cardinals force Game 5 with walk-off win vs. Braves\n\nALDS: Rays rout Astros to keep season alive\n\nThe Dodgers were the National League\u2019s best team at home, going 59-22 at Dodger Stadium during the regular season. Although they lost Game 2 there to the Washington Nationals \u2013 and will have to face Game 2 winner Stephen Strasburg once again \u2013 the Dodgers remain confident.\n\nOne reason the Dodgers are so optimistic: they\u2019ll have right-hander Walker Buehler on the mound with the opportunity to advance.\n\n\u201cI guess this will be my third of those scenarios, so (it\u2019s) something I\u2019m familiar with,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cGetting to do it at home certainly helps and there\u2019s not a lot to it. We got to win a game and if we don\u2019t, we go home.\u201d\n\nBuehler is coming off a masterful start in the series opener, when he shut out the Nationals on one hit over six innings and struck out eight.\n\nWalker Buehler was masterful in Game 1 of the NLDS.

He hasn\u2019t allowed an earned run in his last 17 \u2153 postseason innings \u2013 dating back to a first-inning home run by Christian Yelich of the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 7 of last year\u2019s NLCS.\n\nHo hum. Just another big game with a 25-year-old right-hander on the mound.\n\n\u201cIn those kinds of games, I think it also helps to know you got everyone else behind you, Buehler said. \u201cI think the pressure \u2026 if you spin it in your head the right way, it can make it more fun. So that\u2019s our plan.\u201d\n\nThis used to be the kind of situation where the Dodgers turned to three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw. But with Buehler getting the call in the series opener, the torch may have symbolically been passed.\n\nOne benefit is that the Dodgers will have Kershaw available to come out of the bullpen on full rest in Game 5 as a super-reliever \u2013 in much the same way the Nationals did with Strasburg in their wild-card win and with Max Scherzer earlier in this series.\n\nAfter pitching six innings in the Game 2 loss on Friday, Kershaw was up and throwing in the Dodger bullpen at one point during Game 4.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts said he was ready to call on Kershaw if the Dodgers had been tied or leading in the late innings. \u201cObviously, the game got away from us and so now to preserve him and to have him ready to go, whatever we need from him for Game 5, is certainly a good thing,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nThe Dodgers will have their entire pitching staff available, but the most likely path to victory goes Buehler to Kershaw to closer Kenley Jansen.\n\nBut it all starts with the new staff ace, a 25-year-old right-hander from Lexington, Kentucky.\n\n\u201cGame 5. Win or go home. Buehler-Strasburg,\u201d Roberts mused. \u201cAs a fan, as a player, you live for moments like this.\u201d", "description": "The Dodgers couldn't secure the NLDS in Game 4, setting up a winner-take-all Game 5 against the Nationals at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published A.M.
