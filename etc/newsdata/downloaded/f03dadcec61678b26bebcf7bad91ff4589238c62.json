Multiple theories appeared attempting to explain the situation, including technical warnings, Facebook\u2019s Libra and even Donald Trump\u2019s potential impeachment.\n\nAt the same time, some considered previous lows of $8100 not enough to upend Bitcoin\u2019s correction \u2013 even before it fell.\n\nFor them, $7500 was a more realistic zone for markets to begin picking up. Bitcoin had risen dramatically at the end of June, they argued, and hence needed to consolidate.\n\n\u201cBitcoin consolidating not a bad thing,\u201d Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee said on Wednesday. As Bitcoinist noted this morning, Lee subsequently noted BTC/USD needed a further leg down in order to complete the transition.\n\nBitcoin Now Below Forecast Halving Price\n\nDropping below $8200 meanwhile did represent a watershed moment for one aspect of bitcoin. According to the popular and highly-accurate price model from PlanB, which uses Bitcoin\u2019s stock-to-flow ratio, that level represents where the price should be until the 2020 block reward halving.\n\nIf that price point should now become a target rather than a floor, Bitcoin\u2019s returns in 2019 nonetheless remain impressive.\n\nEven at $7750, investors have achieved gains of over 100% since January 1. Curiously enough, as Bloomberg reported on Thursday, the government of Venezuela may be among them.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, the publication claimed Caracas has a stash of BTC, but \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think is next for the Bitcoin price?
