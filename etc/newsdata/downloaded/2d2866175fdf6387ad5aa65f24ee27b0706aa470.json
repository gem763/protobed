It is unclear when Durham\u2019s inquiry shifted to a criminal investigation.\n\nDurham is examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played in the U.S. probe. He is also investigating whether the surveillance methods and intelligence gathering methods used during the investigation were legal and appropriate.\n\nShifting the DOJ\u2019s sweeping review into a criminal probe enables Durham to subpoena witnesses for testimony and documents. It also authorizes Durham to impanel a grand jury and file charges. The development was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nJoining Nance in expressing concern about the development was CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, who accused the Trump administration was \u201cfully weaponizing DOJ for political purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttorneys General *can* be impeached,\u201d Honig noted.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, the CNN employee downplayed Durham\u2019s new reported powers, predicting the probe will \u201cnever convict a single person on a single count.\u201d\n\nOk haters. Let\u2019s make a deal. I know enough from the available public record and my career as a prosecutor to see that even if Barr dredges up charges here, he will never convict a single person on a single count. If you disagree, say it on record now and I\u2019ll laugh later. \u2014 Elie Honig (@eliehonig) October 25, 2019\n\nNews of the criminal probe follows an NBC report stating Barr recently expanded his agency\u2019s review, noting that Durham has \u201cfound something significant and critics should be careful.\u201d Durham reportedly requested interviews with several CIA analysts involved in studying Russia\u2019s activities during the 2016 presidential election, prompting some of them to hire lawyers.\n\nDurham has reportedly received briefings on the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the FBI\u2019s use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants as part of the bureau\u2019s counterintelligence operation into the Trump campaign. \u201cDurham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process,\u201d Fox News previously reported.\n\nAppearing before Congress in May, Barr testified that he believed \u201cspying did occur\u201d on the Trump campaign, but would not comment on whether it was undertaken within accordance of the law.\n\n\u201cI think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,\u201d he told the Senate Appropriations Committee, before adding, \u201cI am not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it\u2019s important to look at them.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "\"It could incite civil unrest...the ultimate distraction to help steal an election,\" wrote Nance of the DOJ's criminal probe into Spygate.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_18318222465634-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
