Nevils claims that after getting drinks with Lauer and Vieira, she went to Lauer\u2019s room, where he raped her anally even though she \u201cdeclined several times.\u201d She said he \u201cjust did it\u201d and it was not consensual.\n\nNBC News released the following statement in response to the Variety report: \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\n\u2018They\u2019re not allegations of an affair, they\u2019re allegations of a crime, and I think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here who\u2019ve sat with Matt for many, many years.\u2019 Hoda Kotb\n\nOn the air Wednesday morning, Guthrie and Kotb once again appeared to fight back tears as they took a moment to get real with their viewers.\n\n\u201cThis is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it,\u201d said Guthrie. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just very painful \u2026 it\u2019s very, very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nHoda reflected on how this has rocked her perception of someone that she worked with for 12 years.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve known someone for 12 years ... you feel like you know them inside and out, and then all of a sudden a door opens up, and it\u2019s a part of them that you didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: How to respond after someone close to you is accused of sexual assault\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not allegations of an affair, they\u2019re allegations of a crime, and I think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here who\u2019ve sat with Matt for many, many years,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re just gonna continue to process this part of this horrific story.\u201d\n\nBoth anchors also stood behind Nevils. \u201cI know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then, it\u2019s not easy now, and we support her and any women that come forward with claims,\u201d said Guthrie.\n\nRead more: Hoda Kotb has officially taken over Matt Lauer\u2019s \u2018Today\u2019 show co-anchor spot. What does that mean for female news anchors?\n\nNBC isn\u2019t the only network rocked by charges of sexual misconduct against one of its stars, however. Just as the Me Too reckoning was building steam in 2017, Charlie Rose was also fired from \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d for inappropriate behavior, as were NBC\u2019s Billy Bush, \u201cToday\u201d producer Matt Zimmerman and Fox\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly.", "description": "Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb discussed charges against their ex-colleague on the air Wednesday", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS951_TodayS_ZG_20191009102008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
