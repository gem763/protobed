REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo\n\nState-controlled Fortum has been seeking to control of the German company since 2017 but Uniper\u2019s top management had opposed a full takeover, warning it could result in a break up and threaten Uniper\u2019s credit rating.\n\nIf approved by regulators, the agreement between Fortum and the two activist funds would simplify the complex ownership structure that has made resolving the stand-off difficult.\n\nAs part of the deal, Fortum would pay 29.93 euros per share for the combined stake of more than 20.5% held by the two funds. This equates to a price of 2.3 billion euros ($2.52 billion) and will raise Fortum\u2019s Uniper stake to more than 70.5% from 49.99%.\n\nShares in Uniper fell 6.9% to 27.94 euros per share, after details of the deal were announced. Fortum\u2019s stock rose 2.9%.\n\n\u201cIt has been Fortum\u2019s preference to agree with Uniper on a joint path forward, yet discussions have each time ended short of actions,\u201d Fortum said.\n\n\u201cFortum is convinced that this change in Uniper\u2019s ownership structure as well as a resolution of the complex relationship between all parties will return stability and put focus solely on the business and the opportunities available to us.\u201d\n\nThe agreement still needs to be cleared by the United States and Russia, a significant hurdle as Russian regulators have so far capped Fortum\u2019s ownership in Uniper at 49.99% due to a strategic water license operated by the German firm\u2019s local subsidiary.\n\nFortum said it was in discussions with the Russian authorities and had made a preparatory filing to the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), adding it expected the transaction to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cDetails on this are unclear and Uniper\u2019s Russian water business is likely to be a key area of concern where countermeasures may be necessary, however, we think it is unlikely that Fortum would make this move without having had some plan in place,\u201d Bernstein analysts said.\n\nAn FAS spokesman said the regulator had been notified about Fortum\u2019s bid to buy Uniper, without providing further details.\n\nUniper declined to comment.\n\nSeeking to ease concerns at Uniper, Fortum said it would rule out any domination agreement and profit and loss transfer agreement with Uniper and a squeeze out for at least two years.\n\nCredit Suisse said in a note that the deal was positive for Fortum \u201cas it helps resolving (the) deadlock and delivering synergies,\u201d adding that Uniper\u2019s leverage would fall as it would be fully consolidated.\n\nFortum said it would fund the deal with existing cash resources and credit facilities underwritten by Barclays.", "description": "Fortum is set to gain control of Uniper by acquiring the stakes of activist funds Elliott [ECAL.UL] and Knight Vinke, a step that could end a long-running deadlock over ownership between the Finnish utility and German energy firm.", "authors": ["Anne Kauranen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438349412&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970CR", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
