Nickel is used in lithium batteries that power gas-free cars.\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation has been courting automakers to invest in electric-vehicle facilities, including Toyota and Korea\u2019s Hyundai.\n\nSome foreign firms are investing in nickel-battery processing plants in Indonesia, including China\u2019s Tsingshan Holding Group, while construction is underway on some two dozen domestic smelters, according to the government.", "description": "Jakarta (AFP) \u2013 Indonesia will suspend nickel ore exports immediately rather than stopping overseas shipments early next year, officials said on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/a0e780_indonesia-plans-ramp-up-smelting-home-as-it-ship-higher-products-shipping-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
