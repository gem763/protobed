Then the next one will be Spring,\u2019 Andy told Grand Tour Nation.\n\n\u2018Basically at the minute it\u2019s a bit loose. We give them to Amazon and they put them out when they want to.\n\n\u2018This one at the minute is an hour and three quarters. It was two hours and a quarter when I did my first cut.\u2019\n\nThe new series looks set to be only two episodes (Picture: Amazon)\n\nDisgruntled viewers have aired their grievances with the changes on Reddit and it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a little bit miffed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This is absolutely terrible!\u2019 complained user Qosclca. \u2018I was so excited when I heard they were just making specials from now on, thinking that meant we\u2019d be getting a season of specials \u2013 instead of just two specials a year.\n\n\u2018So now that they\u2019ve cut all of the other content, they\u2019re making \u2013 two specials a year?\u2019\n\nThey added: \u2018I used to excitedly wait all year long for a season of The Grand Tour. Now I have to wait all that time for two specials\u2026\u2019\n\nEchoing a similar sentiment fickfackfu wrote: \u2018I\u2019m really very disappointed now. I know the specials are much work, but I thought they would at least make six or eight, maybe two big ones and some smaller ones like China or the Georgia trips from season 3.\n\n\u2018Meh. Better than nothing but come on\u2026 just two?\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s not forget though that Jeremy has got his own Amazon show I Bought The Farm and Richard has got Richard Hammond\u2019s Big over on Discovery.\n\nMeanwhile, James is also going solo with his Amazon project Our Man In\u2026 Japan set to launch next year.\n\nThe Grand Tour season 4 is expected to land on Amazon Prime Video later this year.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
