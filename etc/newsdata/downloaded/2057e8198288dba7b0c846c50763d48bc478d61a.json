Wa\u0142\u0119sa keeps an office in the former, but has not set foot in the latter in many years. He and the union he once led are now on opposite sides of the country\u2019s political rift: Like many of its blue-collar members, the new leadership of Solidarity is largely supportive of a populist government that, according to Wa\u0142\u0119sa, is threatening the country\u2019s hard-won democracy.\n\nRead: A warning from Europe: The worst is yet to come\n\nIn Poland\u2019s first democratic elections after the fall of communism, Wa\u0142\u0119sa endorsed a slate of candidates for the Sejm, the country\u2019s parliament. Among them were the twins Lech and Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. When Wa\u0142\u0119sa was elected Poland\u2019s first president, at the end of 1990, Jaros\u0142aw became his chief of staff.\n\nThe honeymoon did not last long. Although he\u2019d lionized Wa\u0142\u0119sa as a heroic opposition leader, Kaczy\u0144ski soon accused him of secret complicity with the communist regime, and organized raucous protests against the president; one featured a burning effigy of his longtime ally.\n\nLike much of the rest of the world, Kaczy\u0144ski had once thought of Polish democracy as having its origins in a broad popular movement against communist dictatorship; now, he argued that it was built on an unacceptable compromise with communist apparatchiks who secretly remained in control of Poland\u2019s political and cultural institutions.\n\nWith his brother, Lech, Jaros\u0142aw founded a far-right movement built on a series of conspiracy theories. The new Law and Justice Party argued that liberals, homosexuals, and communists were aiming to undermine the true character of the nation from within. From outside, Germany and Russia were plotting to take revenge for their recent defeats. Only uncompromising defenders of traditional Polish values, like the Kaczy\u0144ski twins, stood a chance of saving the nation.\n\nTo the surprise of political analysts, this paranoid stew of fearmongering has proven politically potent. The Kaczy\u0144skis won power in 2005, with Jaros\u0142aw serving as prime minister and his brother Lech as president. Their hold on power slipped away when another party on which Law and Justice relied for its parliamentary majority defected, and Lech died in a tragic plane crash. But in the fall of 2015, Kaczy\u0144ski staged a successful comeback: the party he leads won the presidency as well as, for the first time, an absolute majority in the Sejm.\n\nOver the past four years, Kaczy\u0144ski has used his power to stage a massive attack on Poland\u2019s democratic institutions. In an astoundingly short span of time, he has turned state television networks into reliable purveyors of government propaganda; gained effective control of the country\u2019s court system; weakened the independence of the electoral commission; restricted free speech; and initiated a number of high-profile trials against political opponents, including the director of the European Solidarity Center. As Wa\u0142\u0119sa put it in a public letter co-signed by 14 other senior statesmen from across the political spectrum, the government has repeatedly attacked the country\u2019s \u201cdivision of power\u201d in ways that seriously imperil \u201cthe foundations of the democratic state.\u201d", "description": "The country\u2019s upcoming elections are crucial.
