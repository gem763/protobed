In a series of calls and meetings, he has tried to move Mr. Trump away from proposing any sort of background check measures that he said after the mass shootings he might support.\n\nBut caught between political pressures to do something and doing nothing on gun legislation, Mr. Trump has been idling while Congress waits for a sign from the White House on what it plans to propose. Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. LaPierre on Friday indicated that his priority may be his own political survival rather than making any strides on guns.", "description": "The same day a Senate committee report came out saying the National Rifle Association was a \"foreign asset\" to Russia, Trump sought the gun group's advice.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e85541e00002f0074b64d.jpeg?cache=kvokxqxxfw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
