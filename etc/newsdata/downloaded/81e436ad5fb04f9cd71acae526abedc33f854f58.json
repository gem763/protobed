Democrats, led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, laid out allegations contained in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, after an unclassified version was publicly released shortly before the hearing.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Schiff called the complaint \u201cthe most graphic evidence yet that the president of the United States has betrayed his oath of office.\u201d\n\n[Read the whistleblower complaint]\n\nRepublicans tried to undermine the document\u2019s credibility, noting that the whistleblower was not a direct witness to the events described.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the committee\u2019s ranking Republican, derided the complaint as \u201cfake news\u201d and accused Democrats and journalists of a conspiracy to gin up baseless allegations against Trump. He called the complaint and media coverage of it an \u201cinformation warfare operation\u201d against the president.\n\nFor Maguire, the hearing was his first chance to defend his decision not to immediately turn over the complaint to Congress after it was filed with the intelligence community inspector general on Aug. 12.\n\nMaguire told the intelligence committee that he consulted about the complaint with officials at the White House and the Justice Department and was not able to turn over the document until it was resolved whether it contained material protected by executive privilege.\n\nDemocrats hammered Maguire\u2019s decision, arguing that the law explicitly demands that the director of national intelligence \u201cshall\u201d transmit whistleblower complaints to the intelligence committees.\n\n\u201cWhen the Congress said that something shall be done, and when that something involves wrongdoing of the president, it is not an exception to the statute,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nMaguire stressed that the nature of the complaint, which focused on actions by the president, presented unique considerations. Much of the complaint rests on a phone call that Trump had on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he offered U.S. assistance in an investigation of Trump\u2019s political opponents, including the son of former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nLawmakers questioned why Maguire sought the guidance of executive branch lawyers when the law does not require him to do so.\n\n\u201cI just thought it would be prudent to have another opinion,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nMaguire said he first sought guidance from the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and next from the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Officials raised the possibility that the complaint could be covered by executive privilege, but no one reached a definitive ruling on that, Maguire said.\n\nThe Office of Legal Counsel also found that the complaint did not meet the statutory definition of an \u201curgent concern\u201d under the whistleblower law. That was significant, because the law says that such matters are supposed to be turned over to Congress.\n\nThe inspector general ultimately informed Congress about the existence of the complaint, but not its substance, a decision that Maguire said he supported.\n\n\u201cI was not receiving direction from anybody,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cI have to comply with the way the law is, not the way some people would like it to be.\u201d\n\nMaguire told lawmakers that he supported the right of the whistleblower, whose complaint helped lead to an impeachment inquiry, to raise concerns. He said that he doesn\u2019t know the person\u2019s identity and that no one in the administration has asked him to find it.\n\nMaguire expressed \u201cmy support for the whistleblower,\u201d who he said had followed regular procedures for raising a concern with the inspector general.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, the three lawyers representing the whistleblower said, \u201cWhile we disagree with the legal analysis/decisions discussed by the Acting DNI this morning regarding urgent concerns, we sincerely appreciate his firm statements of support for whistleblower protection in general and specifically that our client acted in good faith and followed the law every step of the way.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers, Andrew Bakaj, Charles McCullough and Mark Zaid, said the inspector general was entitled to continue with his investigation of the complaint.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative the nation understands and witnesses that the system can work and that whistleblowers have a right to anonymity when they follow the law,\u201d they said.", "description": "His appearance Thursday morning marked the first congressional testimony about an explosive matter that has touched off an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Ellen Nakashima", "Shane Harris Covers Intelligence", "National Security For The Post.
