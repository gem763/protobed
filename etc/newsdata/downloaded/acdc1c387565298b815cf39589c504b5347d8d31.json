Arsenal winter transfer targets 1/10 Arsenal winter transfer targets Josh Kroenke has promised Arsenal plan to be \u2018proactive\u2019 in the winter transfer market. But who could they sign? Getty 2/10 Wilfried Zaha Arsenal have not completely given up on prizing Wilfried Zaha away from Crystal Palace. He won't come cheap ... but for the right price Palace may be tempted to cash in, particularly if the 26-year-old fails to impress in the first half of the season. Getty Images 3/10 Eduardo Camavinga The 16-year-old - who enjoyed a breakthrough performance against PSG in Ligue 1 last weekend - is also a target for Manchester United, City and Tottenham. Arsenal could attempt to replicate their William Saliba deal with Saint-\u00c9tienne by signing Camavinga and then immediately loaning him back to current club, Rennes. AFP/Getty Images 4/10 Dayot Upamecano If Josh Kroenke is true to his word, and his family do back the club in the winter market, than 20-year-old defender Dayot Upamecano is surely the first player they will attempt to sign. Arsenal came close to landing him this summer, only to balk at Leipzig's \u00a355m price tag having so recently spent a club-record \u00a372m on Nicolas Pepe. Bongarts/Getty Images 5/10 Samuel Umtiti Arsenal will monitor the first half of the 25-year-old's season at Barcelona very closely. The defender's 2018/19 season was hampered by injury and Unai Emery has gone on record about how much he rates the World Cup winner. Icon Sport via Getty Images 6/10 Daniele Rugani Juventus are desperate to get rid of the defender as they scramble to balance the books ahead of this week's Italian transfer deadline. If they fail to offload Rugani he will certainly be available in the winter, and could make a good cut-price solution if Arsenal do indeed manage to sell Shkodran Mustafi this month. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Robert Arboleda Arsenal came very close to signing the Ecuador international Robert Arboleda from S\u00e3o Paulo on transfer deadline day, instead snapping up David Luiz. But if they are short in defence in five months time, the 27-year-old would make a sensible purchase, especially considering his club were willing to sell. AFP/Getty Images 8/10 Fagner Conserva Another South American defender that Arsenal have preciously explored signing, that they could move for if necessary in January. Plays for Edu's former club Corinthians, which would help speed up any deal. AP 9/10 Everton Arsenal seriously explored signing the 23-year-old Brazil international this summer, but were deterred by his rapidly escalating price tag. But if they are backed by Josh Kroenke this winter, could they return for the Gr\u00eamio star? A move to Europe surely beckons for the electric forward, who won the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica top scorer award this summer. REUTERS 10/10 Toby Alderweireld The Spurs defender will be available to negotiate a free transfer to another club from January. Could Arsenal snap him up? It's happened once before...

But I am trying to do my best to score and assist because that is what I get pleasure from.\u201d\n\nMkhitaryan was naturally very positive about playing for his new club Roma, who struggled last year in Serie A, finishing sixth and failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to play a lot [at Arsenal] \u2013 maybe I would sit on the bench, like I did the last three games before the international break,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI chose Roma because it was a great opportunity for me. I got a call from my agent and I wanted to come because it was a great opportunity for me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a step back because it is a big club, a great club and everyone knows about it.\n\n\u201cI want to do my best for the club. I am not afraid of pressure. If you are a big player for a big team you are always under pressure and people will be watching your every step.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even have a discussion with my agent about money, I just came here to enjoy my football and to achieve our goals.\u201d", "description": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan insists he is focused on a new challenge at Roma after admitting he \u201cwas not fitting in so well in English football\u201d.
