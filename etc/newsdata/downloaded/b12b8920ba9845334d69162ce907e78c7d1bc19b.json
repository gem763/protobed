The prospect becomes less alluring with age, so I have some trepidation stepping in between two old friends, Andrew Napolitano and Joe DiGenova. Through intermediary hosts, the pair \u2014 Napolitano a former New Jersey Superior Court jurist and law professor, DiGenova a former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and prominent defense lawyer \u2014 brawled last week on Fox News (where I, like they, contribute regularly).\n\nADAM GOODMAN: PELOSI'S IMPEACH TRUMP PUSH INSULTS OUR CONSTITUTION. WHY NOT LET VOTERS DECIDE ABOUT TRUMP?\n\nI\u2019m going to steer clear of the pugnacious to-ing and fro-ing. Let\u2019s consider the intriguing legal issue that ignited it.\n\nJudge Napolitano argues that the July 25 conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky contains the makings of a campaign-finance crime. He highlights Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine\u2019s help in investigating then\u2013vice president Joe Biden. In 2016, Biden pressured Kyiv to drop a corruption investigation of Burisma, a natural gas company that paid Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, big bucks to sit on its board.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden, of course, is one of the favorites for the Democratic presidential nomination. Napolitano reasons that the information Trump sought from Ukraine would be a form of \u201copposition research\u201d that could be seen as an in-kind donation to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, which should be deemed illegal because the law prohibits foreign contributions and attempts to acquire them. (Napolitano also raised the \u201carguable\u201d possibility of a bribery offense, on the theory that Trump was withholding defense aid as a corrupt quid pro quo to get the Biden information. But he emphasized the foreign contribution issue. That is his stronger argument, and I am focusing on it, given that the Trump-Zelensky transcript does not support a quid pro quo demand; plus bribery, in any event, raises the same \u201cthing of value\u201d proof problems addressed below.)\n\nDiGenova strongly disagrees. Though there wasn\u2019t much time to elaborate, he is clearly relying on the lack of past campaign-law prosecutions on similar facts. DiGenova is also voicing the prudent conservative hostility to campaign-finance laws: Any expansion of criminal liability would necessarily restrict political speech, the core of First Amendment liberty.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY", "description": "Judge Napolitano argues that the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president contains the makings of a campaign-finance crime.
