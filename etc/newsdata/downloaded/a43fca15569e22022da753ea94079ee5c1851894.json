In July, he told The New Yorker he \u201cabsolutely\u201d regrets resigning, questioning some of the claims. Like some other accused sexual harassers who have returned to the spotlight, he failed to demonstrate that he understood why his behavior was wrong, characterizing it as \u201cgoofing around.\u201d\n\nHis supporters and defenders have argued he was treated unfairly because his transgressions were not as grave as those of some of the other men exposed by the Me Too movement.\n\nFranken\u2019s comeback and new public platform also reinforces an additional problem that emerged because of Me Too: how much predatory men have influenced (and, in this case, continue to influence) our national narratives. It\u2019s difficult to trust someone accused of sexual misconduct to contribute to coverage of the 2020 election, where issues like sexual misconduct and gender inequality will surely loom large.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s women who have often paid a price for speaking out against predatory men. In Franken\u2019s case, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who called for his resignation, along with dozens of her Senate colleagues, faced a disproportionate amount of backlash from Democrats. Some donors pledged not to back her presidential campaign because of Franken\u2019s resignation.\n\nLow poll numbers and fundraising forced her to drop out of the race last month \u2014 with some arguing that her focus on her record of combating sexual misconduct and gender inequity may even have hurt her campaign.", "description": "The former Minnesota senator has a new public platform, continuing the pattern of accused serial sexual predators getting career comebacks.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8b89942200005900511677.jpeg?cache=plsitewgav&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
