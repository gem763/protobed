Such incidents are usually an agonizing, private tragedy for those involved. The allegations in the case of 19-year-old Harry Dunn, however, are a matter of transatlantic diplomacy and threaten to become an embarrassment to the British prime minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThey are also a reminder that diplomatic immunity is often used as a shield in ways that were never intended. Johnson, who once criticized the absurdity of the protections offered, can\u2019t let his voice be muffled this time by his need to keep the Americans onside after Brexit.\n\nOn Aug. 27, Dunn\u2019s motorcycle collided head-on with a Volvo outside a U.S. intelligence base about 70 miles northwest of London; he suffered multiple injuries and was later pronounced dead. Dunn\u2019s devastated family say they were told by police that they believe the Volvo driver was traveling on the wrong side of the road.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle, named as 42-year-old Anne Sacoolas, is the wife of a U.S. diplomat who may have only been in the country for a short period. Police reported that she was cooperative initially and had no plans to leave the country. But after Dunn\u2019s death, Sacoolas claimed immunity and returned to the U.S. with her family.\n\nThe case has sparked outrage in the U.K. Harry Dunn and his family have suffered the ultimate irreversible harm, but they seem to have no recourse at all. Under the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats and their families are protected from prosecution in their host country, though the principle dates back thousands of years.\n\nIt has survived so long for good reason. Not all judicial systems were independent or trustworthy. During the Cold War, there was always the danger that a honeytrap might ensnare a diplomat. But a road in Northamptonshire in 2019 is a long way from such dangers. In recent decades, immunity seems to be abused by diplomats more often than correctly invoked.\n\nWaivers of diplomatic immunity are, in practice, rare. Some years ago the Daily Telegraph revealed that the Metropolitan Police made 19 applications for such waivers in the five years to 2007 and most were rejected. A French diplomat accused of assault was sent home. Saudi officials escaped having to account for allegations of indecent assault and drug-dealing.\n\nYet this isn\u2019t just a problem of serious crimes and misdemeanors. If you included parking violations and other smaller offences, diplomatic law-breaking would count for a significant waste of time and resources for the London police.\n\nAs London mayor, Johnson regularly criticized the U.S. ambassador Robert Tuttle for failing to pay the city\u2019s daily 8 pound ($9.90) congestion charge over three years. \u201cI think it\u2019s the Geneva Convention which prevents me from slapping an \u2018asbo\u2019 on every single diplomat who fails to pay, I think it\u2019s an unbelievable scandal,\u201d Johnson said at the time, referring to the Anti-Social Behavior Order penalty that was often used back then against London\u2019s young hooligans.\n\nOn Monday Johnson broke his silence on Dunn, calling on the U.S. embassy to waive immunity and saying he\u2019d raise the issue with the White House personally. He treads a fine line. His predecessor Tony Blair never lived down accusations that he was George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cpoodle\u201d; Johnson is struggling to appease Trump\u2019s sensitivities on Iran and Huawei, both areas where the U.K. disagrees with the president.\n\nBrexit complicates things. Trump\u2019s promise of a U.S./U.K. trade deal has become a cornerstone of Johnson\u2019s promise that Brexit will be a success. But the Trump impeachment proceedings have been noted in Westminster. Johnson is often compared to the American president; their chumminess will look less advantageous the more trouble Trump finds himself in.\n\nWere immunity to be lifted and Sacoolas found to have caused death by dangerous driving, she might not be sent to prison. Sentences of up to 14 years can be handed down if the offender is under the influence of drink or drugs. But the maximum custodial term for death by \u201ccareless or inconsiderate driving\u201d is five years and that is reserved \u201cfor rare cases when the blame is exceptionally high.\u201d We\u2019re not likely to find out anway.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It is every family\u2019s worst nightmare: a traffic accident that takes the life of a loved one, often\u00a0through no fault of their own.
