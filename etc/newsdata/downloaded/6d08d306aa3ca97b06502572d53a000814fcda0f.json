When you go down there as a member of the crown you become a target,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Wallace continued: \u201cPeople say \u2018bring them back, put them on trial\u2019. If I bring someone back against their will, I\u2019m guilty of rendition. Under international law, I can\u2019t just swoop into a country and grab someone ... unless they come under extradition. We don\u2019t have an extradition treaty with the Syrian regime, not surprisingly.\n\n\u201cTherefore it\u2019s not as straightforward as just flying into those countries and picking people up, because the first thing that will happen when they do come back for trial, the defence will be \u2013 we won\u2019t be able to convict them.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Rhetorical sleight of hand must not be allowed to distract from the disastrous lack of sensible policy in this area.\u201d\n\nSeveral other countries have already taken their citizens out of Syrian Democratic Forces custody, including the US, Belgium, Italy, Morocco and Bosnia.\n\nA number of captured UK jihadis, including Begum and members of \u201cthe Beatles\u201d Isis cell, have voiced wishes to return to Britain even if they are jailed.\n\nMr Wallace claimed that some evidence held on Isis jihadis could not be presented in British courts as the intelligence belongs to other nations.\n\nThe cabinet minister added: \u201cIf we could bring some of these people, and I was prepared to put at risk British soldiers and civil servants to wander around those kind of camps finding them \u2013 we could do all of that, but we might not be able to convict them.\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s see how many people want those people living next door to them. That is a big question.\u201d\n\nA suite of strengthened terror laws came into effect earlier this year, and Isis members can also be charged with pre-existing offences including membership of a proscribed organisation.\n\nA Supreme Court case heard that there was enough evidence to prosecute alleged Isis \u201cBeatles\u201d Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh in Britain, after Sajid Javid suggested there was not.\n\nMr Wallace said when it comes to the children of Isis fighters and their wives \u201cit is of course difficult\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are compassionate to the needs of some of these children,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have done in the past is when those children have got to the Turkish border or to Turkey, they are given consular assistance that we provide in Turkey and those children do get the benefit of the UK.\n\n\u201cBut the policy of providing consular services in Syria has been consistent for a long time, we won\u2019t provide consular services.\u201d\n\nSome nations, including Australia, have facilitated the transfer of people to countries outside Syria where they have consular services.\n\nKen Clarke and former defence minister Tobias Ellwood are among the politicians raising concern over the government\u2019s policy.\n\nMr Ellwood told The Independent the detention of thousands of jihadis and their families in Syria was creating conditions for an Isis resurgence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see Daesh 2.0,\u201d he warned. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a repeat of al-Qaeda regrouping and becoming a very real threat, and that threat won\u2019t just pose itself in the Middle East, but also to Britain.\u201d", "description": "Ministers would be guilty of \u201crendition\u201d if the government brought British Isis fighters and their families back from Syria against their will, the defence secretary Ben Wallace has claimed.
