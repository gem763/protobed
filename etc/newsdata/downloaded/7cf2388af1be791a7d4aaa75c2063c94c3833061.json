REUTERS/Sergiy Karazy\n\nPrivatBank was taken into state hands against the wishes of its ex-owner, Ihor Kolomoisky, in 2016 and its fortunes are closely watched by investors because the International Monetary Fund may freeze aid if the nationalisation is reversed.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has longstanding business ties with Kolomoisky, demanded the investigation after the home of a former central banker responsible for nationalising the bank was torched in a nighttime attack in a village outside Kiev.\n\nAs part of an IMF-supported clean-up of Ukraine\u2019s financial system, the authorities nationalised PrivatBank saying the lender had a $5.6 billion hole in its balance sheet due to shady lending practices. Kolomoisky disputed this assessment.\n\nZelenskiy has strenuously denied suggestions that he would help Kolomoisky regain control of PrivatBank or win compensation. His new Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk on Tuesday in a message to Reuters denied an earlier newspaper report about a potential settlement, saying he was not holding talks with Kolomoisky.\n\nBut Kolomoisky told Reuters by phone he believed the government was looking for a compromise.\n\n\u201cHoncharuk is the first smart prime minister in recent times. He understands that there must be a compromise,\u201d Kolomoisky said. \u201cOtherwise ... I won\u2019t leave them alone.\u201d\n\nPolice have opened a criminal investigation after a property belonging to the family of former Central Bank Governor Valeria Gontareva was burned down. Gontareva did not say who might be responsible for the arson attack.\n\n\u201cThe fire accident in the house of the former Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine is a brutal crime, the rapid investigation of which should be a priority in the work of the law enforcement agencies,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEveryone should feel protected in Ukraine, regardless of their past or current positions and political views.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s central bank said reformers were being intimidated in order to paralyse their activities.\n\n\u201cThis is no longer a series of incidents, it is TERROR. Its purpose is to intimidate reformers, past and present, to paralyse our activities, to make us silent. We will not be silent,\u201d the central bank said in a written statement.\n\nThe United States embassy called for an investigation. The opposition party led by former President Petro Poroshenko called the arson attack a signal of Ukraine\u2019s deteriorating investment climate.\n\nA video shared with Reuters by Gontareva, who currently lives in London, showed firefighters tackling a massive blaze in her home in the village of Horenychi, on the outskirts of Kiev.\n\nRelated Coverage Ukraine PM denies report on negotiations over PrivatBank\n\nNO PRIVATBANK NEGOTIATIONS\n\nZelenskiy, a former comedian and actor, entered politics as a political novice this year promising to tackle corruption. He beat incumbent President Poroshenko in April.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s relationship with Kolomoisky has been under intense scrutiny. The two have longstanding business ties and Kolomoisky\u2019s 1+1 TV channel was the springboard for Zelenskiy\u2019s presidential election campaign.\n\nThe president has repeatedly denied suggestions he would help Kolomoisky win back PrivatBank or help Kolomoisky win compensation. The two men met publicly last week but Kolomoisky told reporters that PrivatBank was not discussed.\n\nHoncharuk was quoted by the Financial Times as saying on Tuesday that Zelenskiy wanted a settlement with Kolomoisky, a report which he subsequently denied.\n\n\u201cWe are not holding any negotiations,\u201d Honcharuk said in a message to Reuters, in response to queries about his comments.\n\nAny hint of the government rowing back on the nationalisation would sound alarm bells just as an IMF mission is in town to discuss a new aid-for-reforms deal with the government, which took charge following a snap July election.\n\nKolomoisky on Friday said there was room for an amicable solution now Zelenskiy was president.\n\nThe IMF did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNO STRENGTH LEFT\n\nTuesday\u2019s arson attack that marked the latest in a string of incidents affecting the former central bank governor.\n\nGontareva, who suffered injuries after being hit by a car in central London last month, believes she is being hounded by Kolomoisky over her decision to nationalise PrivatBank, which the businessman denies.\n\n\u201cThe house burned down completely,\u201d Gontareva, 54, told Reuters. \u201cI have no strength left to keep going.\u201d Earlier this month, a vehicle registered to her daughter-in-law, who shares her exact name, was torched in Kiev.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters in London on Saturday, Gontareva, in a wheelchair with casts on both her legs, said the incidents were intended to intimidate current central bank employees who have a say over the future of PrivatBank.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nLondon police said they were not treating the car incident as suspicious and the driver was not arrested.\n\nKolomoisky denies orchestrating a campaign against Gontareva.", "description": "Ukraine's president called on Tuesday for a full investigation into an arson attack that has raised political tensions in a dispute over the IMF-backed nationalisation of the country's largest lender PrivatBank.", "authors": ["Pavel Polityuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430842517&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0Z8", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
