The \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d star (and my new hero) was arrested Friday outside the U.S. Capitol as part of her promised weekly protests called Fire Drill Fridays inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s Fridays for Future climate strikes.\n\nThis is her second Friday in a row being arrested in front of the Capitol \u2014 and she ain\u2019t show up alone this time. Her co-star on \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d Sam Waterston (or as others at Gizmodo call him, the \u201cLaw and Order guy\u201d) joined Fonda. Capitol Police arrested him, too! This was homie\u2019s first arrest ever, according to NBC News producer Frank Thorp who was on the scene. To make things better, Fonda was arrested looking like the goddamn queen she is. Take a look.\n\nJane Fonda getting arrested during a climate change protests blocking the street at the Capitol: pic.twitter.com/eep23mHEfh \u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 18, 2019\n\nI typically don\u2019t care much for celebrity takes on climate change. I appreciate it when they use their platforms to bring attention to the issue, of course, but that usually involves giant lump sums of money, and something about that just doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Money can\u2019t solve everything, man. What Fonda is doing, however, is so incredibly brave and badass.\n\nAs an older white woman who also happens to be a celebrity, she\u2019s using her privilege to bring attention to the issue. She\u2019s also standing in solidarity with others who face arrest at these climate change protests. More and more people are using civil disobedience and direct action to protest climate change or take action to prevent it. Arrest, unfortunately, is typically a part of that deal.\n\nShout out to the Law and Order guy! (Photo: AP)\n\nAnd Fonda\u2019s taken a page out of Thunberg\u2019s book by taking these protests directly to the people who have the power to do something about the climate crisis: our elected officials. The climate movement needs young people, but it also needs older community members. To be real, we need everyone. And Fonda is doing a hell of a job bringing all types of people \u2014 even the Grace and Frankie/Law and Order guy \u2014 into the mix.", "description": "Jane Fonda is not playing when it comes to climate change.
