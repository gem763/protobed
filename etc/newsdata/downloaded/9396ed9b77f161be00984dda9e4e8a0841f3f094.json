Bigelow will sell time aboard to government researchers and space tourists\n\nRobert Bigelow and NASA astronaut Mike Gernhardt, principal investigator for the NextSTEP Habitat Testing Program, in front of a B330 inflatable space station testing unit\n\nThat accelerated timeline spawned the space agency\u00b4s Artemis program, which calls for privately built lunar landers, robotic rovers and Lunar Gateway - a modular space station in orbit around the Moon with living quarters for astronauts, a lab for science and ports for visiting spacecraft.\n\nRobert Bigelow said: 'Gateway is an opportunity to test all these structures in a deep space environment... as a prelude to going to Mars.\n\n'Potentially we think that for the rest of this century, the expandable architecture is where it's at.'\n\nBigelow's B330 habitat, launched from Earth compacted inside a rocket, is made of a fabric-like material designed to shield inhabitants from deep-space radiation and high-speed space debris.\n\nBigelow's B330 habitat, launched from Earth compacted inside a rocket, is made of a fabric-like material designed to shield inhabitants from deep-space radiation\n\nOnce docked alongside other Gateway modules in lunar orbit, the habitat unfurls into a two-story, 55-foot-long (16-meter-long) outpost that up to six astronauts could stay in.\n\nThe lunar space habitat and colonization program is expected to cost over a billion dollars through 2028.\n\nToilets, beds and windows\n\nFour other companies are doing mockups: Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Lockheed Martin.\n\nEach of the companies received a chunk of the $65 million that NASA allotted in 2017 to develop the prototypes. The space agency\u00b4s proposed funding for 2020 includes $500 million to kickstart development of an initial version of Gateway.\n\nThe companies are giving NASA ideas - such as where to place astronaut toilets, how big the beds should be and how many windows the station should have. Those will inform a blueprint that NASA is due to release in the coming months.\n\nA cutaway display model shows the interior of a Bigelow Aerospace B330 inflatable space station\n\nNASA astronaut Mike Gernhard said NASA wants the habitats to include exercise equipment, a small kitchen, noise-cancelling sleep stations that also block out light and 'a reliable and easy-to-use toilet that's in a location that minimizes the potential for cross contamination with science and meal preparation activities.'\n\nGernhardt and two other astronauts spent three days living in each prototype habitat.\n\nFor its Gateway habitat mockup, Lockheed Martin is outfitting beds, tables and windows in a 15-foot-wide and roughly 22-foot-long stainless steel structure originally designed as a shipping container to carry supplies to and from the International Space Station.\n\nBigelow Aerospace B330 inflatable space station mock-up in space\n\nBill Pratt, Lockheed\u00b4s habitat program manager, said: 'The space that you\u00b4re living in has to be reconfigurable for the task at hand.\n\n'Like in an RV, your table becomes the bed that you sleep on at night.'\n\nBigelow said his B330 habitat has two toilets for a crew of up to six to use, and that entertainment in the form of virtual-reality Earth simulations for astronauts to feel at home was in the works for future habitats that will revolve around Mars.", "description": "Dozens of NASA officials and veteran astronauts are wrapping up a review of five space habitat mockups built by different companies, that we may one day inhabit on the moon.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/09/19875568-0-image-a-15_1571387501829.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
