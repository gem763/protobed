For the late August 2019 show, he\u2019ll share emcee duties with a special guest: Stevie, a petite and personable figure who\u2019s been living at Knollwood for the last six weeks.\n\nSoriano wants to sing the crowd-pleasing hit \u201cYMCA\u201d while Stevie leads the crowd through the song\u2019s signature dance moves. But Stevie is a robot, and this is harder than it sounds.\n\n\u201cWe could try to make him dance,\u201d says Niamh Donnelly, the robot\u2019s lead AI engineer, though she sounds dubious. She enters commands on a laptop. In response, Stevie stretches its peg-like arms. A grin flashes on its LED-screen face. \u201cIt would be very helpful if he had elbows,\u201d says Conor McGinn, an assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin and Stevie\u2019s lead engineer. \u201cIt was just a thought,\u201d Soriano says. \u201cWhat matters is what Stevie\u2019s comfortable with.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/tim191104v1_health.cover_.final_.usethis.jpg?quality=85&w=1012", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
