We used that 'what do they know' approach. We didn't give up at that point.\"\n\nInstead Carter, Dash and Burke, started their own label, called Roc-A-Fella Records, in 1994. Carter released his debut album \"Reasonable Doubt\" on Roc-A-Fella in 1996. Though sales started slow, the album caught the attention of label executives.\n\n\"I think that was the genius thing we did. We started selling our own CDs and built our own buzz,\" Carter said in 2010. \"Then, the record companies came back to us.\"\n\nDef Jam (a label that has now worked with artists like Justin Bieber and Kanye West) tried to offer Carter a deal at the time, according to The Wall Street Journal. In response, Carter replied, \"I own the company I rap for.\"\n\n\"We had a different negotiation, it wasn't the same artist-label relationship,\" Carter said at the 2010 summit. \"Now, we retained ownership in our own company, and it was the best thing for us.\"\n\nInstead of signing with Def Jam, Carter eventually sold Roc-A-Fella Records to the label.\n\nDef Jam first purchased half of Roc-A-Fella Records in 1997 for $1.5 million, and then bought the remaining half in 2004 for $10 million, according to MTV.\n\nIn 2008, Carter founded entertainment agency, Roc Nation, as part of a venture with Live Nation. Roc Nation represents talent in both music and sports, including Rihanna and NBA star Kevin Durant. Carter remains the CEO of Roc Nation today.\n\nCarter has also invested in and launched companies including D'Uss\u00e9, a cognac he co-owns with Bacardi; Armand de Brignac, a champagne; and Tidal, a music-streaming service. The entertainment and business mogul also has a stake in Uber that Forbes estimated was worth $70 million in June.\n\nAs an artist, Carter has collected 14 No. 1 albums and 22 Grammy awards.\n\nLike this story?
