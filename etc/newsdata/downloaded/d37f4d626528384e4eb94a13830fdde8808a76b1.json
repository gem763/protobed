The heist was ultimately blocked by a giant seal sleeping in their path, police said.\n\nPolice began to search the island after locals alerted authorities to a yacht that had run aground after passing over a patch of coral. The crew, they said, was acting strangely; during an overhead search, police spotted Antoine Dicenta, 51 of France, and Graham Palmer, 34 of the UK, attempting to escape, per the Australian Broadcasting Company.\n\nAt the time, the men allegedly had 1.2 US tons of drugs worth about $690 million, according to Newsweek. They allegedly hid the methylamphetamine, cocaine, and ecstasy in bags and tried to disguise it under seaweed, ABC reported.\n\nThe men attempted to hide, but a police helicopter spotted the pair because one was wearing a pink shirt, Geraldton Volunteer Marine Rescue Service Vice Commander Damien Healy told the Australian Broadcasting Company. The two then tried to make it to a small, inflatable dinghy and escape the island. Only something was standing \u2014 or rather sleeping \u2014 in their way.\n\nIt was a large seal.\n\n\"They woke it up and it jumped up with its big chest out and bellowed at them,\" Healy said. \"The guys basically had the choice of going through the seal or getting arrested and they ended up choosing getting arrested.\"\n\nRead more: 2 men got trapped in a shipping container full of cocaine in record heat and had to call the police for help\n\nChris Dawson, Western Australia's police commissioner, says that three others have been arrested since, calling them \"shore party.\"\n\n\"They were in another boat and they were ready to receive,\" Dawson told ABC radio. \"We've disrupted an international big drug syndicate here.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, 50-year-old New South Wales resident, Angus Bruce Jackson, was detained at the Perth airport, and Jason Dean Lassiter, 45 of the US, and Scott Felix Jones, 35 of the UK, were arrested in the city of Perth, according to Seven News Australia.\n\nAll five men have refused bail and remain in custody, The Guardian reported. Dicenta and Palmer already appeared in court and are scheduled to do so again on September 20. Lassiter is due in court on September 26, Jones on October 8, and Jackson on November 21.\n\nNOW WATCH: The surprising economic reason drug cartel members get head-to-toe tattoos", "description": "Two men from the UK were arrested on September 2 after being found in possession of $690 million worth of drugs.
