When President George W. Bush challenged California\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and mileage-setting ability, California fought it. The Obama administration subsequently dropped the Bush effort.\n\nThe Trump plan would have to be posted in the Federal Register and would be subject to public comment.\n\nHis administration has tried to ease or remove scores of environmental regulations that it regards as unnecessary and burdensome. The tougher mileage standards were a key part of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to reduce climate-changing fossil fuel emissions.\n\nCalifornia has sued the Trump administration 27 times on environmental matters alone, often as part of a group of states. Counting preliminary injunctions, California has won in court 19 times, said Sarah Lovenheim, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.\n\nBecerra, a Democrat, made clear his state would battle this move as well. \u201cCalifornia will continue its advance toward a cleaner future. We\u2019re prepared to defend the standards that make that promise a reality,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nEPA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\nThe mileage move would target California\u2019s half-century-old authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own, tough tailpipe emission standards. California\u2019s long struggles with smog mean the state has been setting its own standards since before the 1970 law was written. Congress allowed California to seek waivers from the national standards for that reason.\n\nAbout a dozen states have opted to follow California\u2019s pollution and mileage standards.\n\nThe waiver has allowed California, the state with the highest population and by far the biggest economy, to steer the rest of the nation toward cutting down on car and truck emissions that pollute the air and alter the climate.\n\nMargo Oge, director of the EPA\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1994 to 2012, said the Trump administration is likely to lose in a court challenge of California\u2019s powers.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing under the Clean Air Act that allows the EPA to revoke a waiver that was given to the state,\u201d she said. \u201cThey cannot do that, in my view, based on 20 years managing the program.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed freezing gas mileage requirements for automakers at 2021 levels, thus eliminating Obama-era regulations that require them to rise about 5% per year on average for the fleet of new cars sold in the U.S. A final proposal is expected next month.\n\nTrump\u2019s own administration, in documents proposing to freeze the standards, puts the cost of meeting the Obama-era requirements at around $2,700 per vehicle. It claims buyers would save that much by 2025, over standards in place in 2016. But that number is disputed by environmental groups and is more than double the estimates from the Obama administration.\n\nConsumer Reports found that the owner of a 2026 vehicle will pay over $3,300 more for gasoline during the life of a vehicle if the standards are frozen at 2021 levels.\n\nMany in the auto industry don\u2019t like the far tougher Obama-era mileage standards and fear it won\u2019t be able to meet them, as U.S. consumers keep shifting away from sedans to less-efficient trucks and SUVs. Most automakers favor increasing mileage requirements at a lower rate than set under President Barack Obama. They also want one U.S. standard to avoid having to engineer separate vehicles for California and the states that follow its rules.\n\nIn July, four automakers \u2014 Ford F, +1.52% , Honda 7267, +3.01% , BMW BMW, +1.03% and Volkswagen VOW, +0.62% \u2014 broke from the rest of the industry and struck a deal with California agreeing to 3.7% increases in mileage per year. That\u2019s less than the 5% annual increase under the Obama-era standards.\n\nThe side deal has irked Trump, who has chastised Ford in tweets.", "description": "The Trump administration is moving forward with a proposal to revoke part of California\u2019s authority to set its own automobile gas mileage standards, a...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE384_traffi_ZG_20190221165250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
