Branson, with a 51% stake, retains control of the company which had a market cap of $2.3 billion following the announcement of the merger completion on Friday. Palihapitiya is chairman of the combined company.\n\nThis raised much-needed funds for Virgin Galactic after Branson in 2018 said the company would suspend discussions with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund over a planned $1 billion investment after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThrough a SPAC deal, Virgin Galactic was able to avoid the risk of struggling to sell shares to investors in a traditional IPO process given that the funding has already been raised.\n\nVirgin Galactic has yet to turn a profit and incurred net losses of $86.7 million in the first six months of 2019.\n\nSeveral other loss-making companies, including Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) and fitness start-up Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O), have struggled since going public earlier this year.\n\nAn IPO of shared office company WeWork was scrapped last month after investors raised concerns over its burgeoning losses and poor corporate governance.\n\n\u201cThis is a shaky environment for companies with grand visions but unproven models\u201d said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nBranson is racing against competitors Blue Origin, the space business of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) founder Bezos, and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX to bring tourists into space.\n\nHundreds of people from 60 countries, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber, have paid or put down deposits to fly on one of Virgin\u2019s suborbital flights.\n\nSome of Virgin Galactic\u2019s ticket holders have been waiting over 14 years for their trip. A 90-minute flight, which allows passengers to experience a few minutes of weightlessness, costs about $250,000.", "description": "Richard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc fetched a valuation of around $2.3 billion on its market debut on Monday, after shares in the first publicly traded space tourism company popped before fizzling out.", "authors": ["Bharath Manjeshr", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445859525&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R11D", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
