Parents say the initiative encourages kids to engage in unhealthy and dangerous sexual activity.\n\nAustin Independent School District\u2019s board unanimously approved the new course material on Tuesday. The curriculum, which spans grades three through eight, will touch upon gender identity \u2013 a first for the district. Seventh graders (12-year-olds) will also learn about how to correctly use a condom. Proponents of the new guidelines said that it\u2019s important to foster \u201chealthy communication\u201d about sex and relationships, as well as to reaffirm the district\u2019s support for the LGBTQ community.\n\nAlso on rt.com I am a trans woman \u2013 but I think this woke world has gone too far\n\nPlenty of parents were less than thrilled about the new changes, however.\n\n\u201c[The curriculum] encourages minor children to engage in vaginal, oral, and anal sexual activity through the comprehensive sex ed they\u2019re voting on,\u201d Carol Ayala, the director of Concerned Parents of Texas, told local media.\n\nOthers expressed fears that focusing on gender identity at such a young age would be detrimental to children who barely understand their own biology.\n\nDemonstrations both for and against the curriculum were held outside the board meeting. A group of parents opposed to the course material were countered by a trans woman who shouted \u201ctrans lives matter\u201d as she was hauled off by police.\n\nOfficers took the transgender woman into AISD PD headquarters as she yelled \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and \u201ctrans lives matters.\u201d pic.twitter.com/lottu21Bov \u2014 Tom Miller (@TomMillerKXAN) October 28, 2019\n\nThe district says that parents will have the chance to opt out of the sex-ed curriculum lessons for their children. The new curriculum could be in place as early as May 2020.\n\nLike this story?
