The report claimed Smolenkov had to be extracted from Russia in 2017 in part because of concerns about the way Trump handled classified intelligence following a meeting with two Russian officials that May.\n\nThe information Trump shared with the Russians in 2017 wasn't related to the CIA's asset. But the president's disregard for strict intelligence-sharing rules to protect highly placed sources \"prompted intelligence officials to renew earlier discussions about the potential risk\" that the source in Russia would be exposed,\" CNN reported.\n\nThe White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to CNN that its \"reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger.\"\n\nRussian officials echoed the White House and called CNN's story \"fake\" and said it was an \"order\" to discredit Trump.\n\nLater Monday, The New York Times, and NBC News followed up with their own reporting which revealed identifying details about Smolenkov, including the type of work he did in the Russian government and the fact that he currently lives in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Times revealed that Smolenkov was a mid-level Russian official the CIA had cultivated decades ago who had rapidly moved up through the ranks of the Russian government. Eventually, the report said, Smolenkov became invaluable after landing \"an influential position\" that included access to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut as the US learned the extent to which Russia was interfering in the 2016 election \u2014 and as the media reported on it and began to examine the CIA's sources in the Kremlin \u2014 US officials reportedly worried about Smolenkov's safety and decided to offer to extract him in late 2016, before Trump took office.\n\nRead more:'You actually have to give a s--- about your spies': Intel veterans are floored by report that an asset was extracted from Russia in part because of Trump\n\nThe Times' report cited current Trump administration officials as saying the media's scrutiny was the only reason for the extraction, but CNN reported that officials' concerns for the asset's safety were compounded after Trump's Oval Office meeting with the Russians in 2017.\n\nCrucially, the report said officials did not disclose Smolenkov's identity or location because both were \"closely held secrets\" and his life remains in danger.\n\nShortly after, NBC News published its own report which revealed that Smolenkov resides in Washington, DC. The report also divulged other details about their home and what happened when a reporter for NBC News knocked on Smolenkov's door.\n\nRussian state-sponsored media later said it had a name for the suspected intelligence asset. The Russian government has previously targeted former spies living abroad for assassinations, like Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko.\n\nLitvinenko was a former FSB officer who defected to the UK in 2001 after accusing his superiors of corruption. He died in November 2006 after being poisoned, and British police determined that the Russian government was behind the assassination.\n\nSkripal is a former Russian military intelligence officer who acted as a double agent for the UK and has been living there since 2010. He and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned in Salisbury in March 2018 but survived, and the UK determined that the Russian government was also behind the Skripals' attempted assassination.", "description": "The move comes after several US media outlets revealed personal details about the asset, his work, his identity, and his location.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ab1d32e22af07ee3fda84-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
