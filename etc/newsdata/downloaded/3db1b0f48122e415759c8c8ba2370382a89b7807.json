It didn\u2019t comment on the substance of the discussion, saying in an emailed response to a query that \u201cas usual, we are not reporting on such confidential conversations.\u201d\n\nThe EU denied its position had changed. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said \u201cthe EU position has not changed. We want a deal. We are working for a deal with the U.K.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted testily that \u201cwhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people,\u201d he said, addressing Johnson. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u201d \u2014 a Latin phrase meaning \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d\n\nIrish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney tweeted that it was \u201chard to disagree\u201d with Tusk\u2019s statement, saying it reflected \u201cfrustration across EU and the enormity of what\u2019s at stake for us all.\u201d\n\nEU leaders have demanded more \u201crealism\u201d from Britain in response to a Brexit plan proposed by Johnson. The bloc says the proposals don\u2019t fulfill the U.K.\u2019s commitment to a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, has urged the bloc to compromise.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU will assess by Friday whether a deal is possible.\n\nJohnson\u2019s opponents in Britain accused the government of deliberately undermining the Brexit talks. Keir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the main opposition Labour Party, said the Downing St. statement was \u201cyet another cynical attempt by No. 10 to sabotage the negotiations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who opposes Brexit, tweeted: \u201cThe UK government\u2019s attempts to shift the blame for the Brexit fiasco to anyone but themselves - today it\u2019s Merkel - is pathetically transparent.\u201d\n\nJohnson insists the U.K. will leave the EU on Oct. 31 even without a deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Britain published more details of its plans for a no-deal Brexit, which the government says can minimize any economic shock from leaving without a deal.\n\nEconomists and major business groups warn that no amount of preparation can eliminate the pain of new barriers with the EU, which accounts for almost half of U.K. trade.\n\nMany in the EU - and in Britain - are skeptical that Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31, because the U.K. Parliament has passed a law compelling the government to ask the EU for a delay to Brexit if no deal is agreed upon by Oct. 19.\n\nJohnson says he will obey the law, but will not ask for a delay. It\u2019s not clear how those two statements can bd reconciled - but it\u2019s clear Johnson wants to pin the blame for any delay on Parliament and the EU, so that he can campaign as a champion of Brexit in a U.K. election that\u2019s likely to be called soon.\n\nThe U.K. Parliament is set to be suspended later Tuesday so that a new session can begin next week with a major policy speech from Johnson\u2019s Conservative government.\n\nAn earlier attempt by the government to shut down Parliament for five weeks was ruled illegal by the U.K. Supreme Court because it had the effect of preventing Parliament from scrutinizing the government\u2019s Brexit plans. This week\u2019s shorter suspension is more routine. Lawmakers will return on Monday for the State Opening of Parliament, which includes a speech delivered by Queen Elizabeth II outlining the government\u2019s legislative plans.\n\nBut most of those plans may be halted by an early election. Both government and the opposition see a national vote as the only way to break Britain\u2019s Brexit deadlock, though they disagree on the timing.\n\n___\n\nCasert reported from Brussels.
