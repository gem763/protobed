That\u2019s $100 cheaper than its usual starting price of $799.\n\nThe Pixel 4 is a pretty solid phone, so this is a nice way to save a good amount on Google\u2019s latest flagship. It also makes it the same price as Apple\u2019s 64GB iPhone 11 \u2014 so if you\u2019ve been trying to decide between which to buy, this deal makes that decision quite a bit harder.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked Google if you\u2019ll still get the $100 Google Store credit if you buy the Pixel 4 through this deal. Amazon already offers the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL with a $100 Amazon gift card, but you have to buy the phones at their regular prices to get that deal.", "description": "Google\u2019s Pixel 4 doesn\u2019t come out until Thursday, but it\u2019s already discounted on Amazon, where you can buy a 64GB Pixel 4 in \"clearly white\" right now for $699.99.
