February was the only month in 2019 in which the target was met.\n\nA&E departments are also feeling the strain as backed-up hospital beds make it harder for them to find places to put new patients, so leave them waiting on temporary beds known as 'trolleys'.\n\nCancer charity Macmillan slammed the \u2018unacceptable\u2019 figures, which also showed a record number of cancer patients were forced to wait more than two weeks for a referral\n\nOfficial figures show there were a total of 121,420 trolley waits of more than four hours in August and September this year. The figure is nearly treble that from four years ago.\n\nBritish Medical Association (BMA) council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: 'The NHS has just experienced its worst-ever summer \u2013 this is incredibly alarming and should be taken as a serious warning sign of the chaos that is likely to unfold in the NHS this coming winter.\n\n'With summer performance now as bad as recent winters, we have reached a point of year-round crisis and the Government cannot continue to let this happen.\n\n'Patient care is suffering, NHS staff working tirelessly around the clock are suffering, and with Brexit on the horizon and early indicators of an extremely cold winter, we are on a collision course for what is likely to be the worst winter ever.\n\nBRITAIN FACES DIFFICULT FLU SEASON DUE TO UNPRECEDENTED OUTBREAK THAT HAS ROCKED AUSTRALIA The worrying waiting times figures come as the country braces for a severe flu outbreak over winter. Almost 293,000 flu cases have been recorded in Australia so far in 2019, with the outbreak beginning to take hold in March. Australia's flu season usually lasts begins in May and lasts until October, with their outbreaks normally peaking in August. In comparison, there were less than 230,000 confirmed reports of influenza by the same time point - until the end of September - in 2017. That year's outbreak was the same that saw the rise of 'Aussie flu', after the country was rocked by a strain that eventually made it to the UK. Most of the Australian cases confirmed by laboratory tests earlier this summer - 57 per cent - were shown to be an unknown type of influenza A. Leading experts warned earlier in June that it is likely the UK will have an equally bad winter, saying the outbreak is 'very scary'. The flu season in the UK and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere tends to mirror what has happened in the Southern Hemisphere. The same strains of the virus will circulate north in time for the British flu season, which typically begins in November and lasts until March. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive at NHS Providers, said at the time: 'The spike in flu we are seeing in Australia could be a worrying signal of what is to come for health and care services this winter. 'Planning for vaccinations is based on what happens in the southern hemisphere.' Australia's flu season peaks in July and August.\n\n'This is a serious plea - we need to see investment across the board including community and social care, and resources such as more beds, reaching the frontline now.'\n\nPatricia Marquis, England's director at the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u2018Nurses treating patients in corridors belongs in the past.\n\n\u2018But signs so far suggest that such scenes will become more, not less, commonplace as we head towards Christmas.\u2019\n\nAnd she warned the shortage of 43,000 nurses across England could harm patients and threaten the mental wellbeing of nurses themselves.\n\nMs Marquis said: \u2018Before winter and the annual onset of flu has truly begun these latest figures paint a picture of a health service already running to catch up with demand.\u2019\n\nMiriam Deakin, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers \u2013 a body that represents all trusts \u2013 said the figures show just how much pressure they are under.\n\nShe added that trusts are working \u2018incredibly hard\u2019 to prepare for the winter but there is a strong chance the demand will only grow and leave patients waiting longer for treatment.\n\nSarah Scobie, deputy director of research at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, called for an \u2018urgent plan\u2019 to fix the staffing shortage across the NHS.\n\nShe said: \u2018Today\u2019s NHS performance statistics reveal very starkly the pressure facing the NHS and the impact this has on more and more patients.\n\n\u2018Without a sufficient and urgent plan for solving the workforce crisis, these targets will continue to go in a worse direction and patients will suffer as a result.\u2019\n\nProfessor Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: \u2018The NHS has had a difficult enough time dealing with winter pressures over the last few years.\n\n\u2018Throw into the mix the pensions crisis, which is leading many senior clinicians to cut back on extra work, and the uncertainty of how Brexit might affect the flow of medicines and medical devices coming into the UK, and the NHS could face a \u201cperfect storm\u201d this winter.\n\n\u2018Gone are the years where NHS hospitals had the staff and time to recover over the summer months in preparation for the busy winter period.\n\n\u2018Today\u2019s performance figures show waiting times continued to deteriorate over the summer. We need swift and far-reaching government action to get the NHS shipshape for winter.\u2019\n\nProfessor Alderson added: \u2018Behind every statistic is a patient in pain and distress. The facts speak for themselves.\u2019\n\nMoira Fraser-Pearce, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \u2018It is unacceptable that record numbers of patients are now missing out on the two-week referral target.\n\n\u2018This demonstrates how critical it is that the Government addresses the NHS workforce crisis as an urgent priority.\n\n\u2018Targets will only continue to be breached if the government doesn\u2019t take action to grow and sustain the numbers of NHS staff.\u2019", "description": "Health leaders condemned the figures and said they show NHS England is on a collision course for its worst winter ever with Brexit, harsh weather conditions and a flu outbreak on the horizon.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19546034-0-image-a-4_1570722088562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
