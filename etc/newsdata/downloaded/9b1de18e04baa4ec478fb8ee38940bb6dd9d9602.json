(Krzysztof Sitkowski, Pool, AFP)\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier asked Poland's forgiveness on Sunday 80 years after Germany's attack triggered World War II, while his Polish counterpart denounced Russia's recent \"imperialist\" aggression against its neighbours.\n\n\n\nPoland suffered some of the worst horrors of World War II: Nearly six million Poles died in the conflict that killed more than 50 million people overall.\n\nThat figure includes the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust, half of them Polish.\n\n\"I bow before the Polish victims of German tyranny. And I ask your forgiveness,\" Steinmeier said at pre-dawn ceremonies in the western Polish city of Wielun, where Germany's first bombs fell 80 years ago.\n\n\"It was Germans who committed these crimes against humanity in Poland. Anyone calling them things of the past, or claiming that the vile rule of terror of the National Socialists in Europe was a mere footnote of German history, is passing judgement on him or herself,\" Steinmeier said alongside his Polish counterpart.\n\nThe line appeared to be a reference to the German far-right, whose co-leader Alexander Gauland once called the 12-year Third Reich a \"speck of bird poop\" on an otherwise glorious German past.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda for his part denounced Nazi Germany's attack on Poland, calling it \"an act of barbarity\" and \"a war crime\" but also hailed post-war reconciliation.\n\nLater on Sunday, Duda slammed recent Russian military attacks against its neighbours as \"imperialist tendencies\" at state ceremonies in Warsaw attended by US Vice President Mike Pence and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nSanctions\n\nThe Polish leader did not specifically name Russia, but referenced Moscow's actions against \"Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 that altered borders\".\n\nHe urged \"the leaders of Europe and the world, NATO and EU members\" to guard against appeasing aggressors.\n\n\"There must be sanctions, resolute actions, it must be obvious that any military aggression will be met with a firm reaction,\" Duda said. \"Closed eyes are not a good recipe for keeping the peace; it's a good way to encourage aggressive personalities, to give the green light for new attacks.\"\n\nPolish authorities said they had not invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sunday's ceremonies because of Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nNazi Germany's attack on Poland on September 1, 1939, came a week after Berlin and the Soviet Union secretly agreed to carve up Eastern Europe between them by signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans attended a separate dawn remembrance ceremony on Sunday in Westerplatte, on Poland's Baltic coast, where a Nazi German battleship had opened fire on a Polish fort 80 years ago to the day.\n\n'Demand compensation'\n\nHitler's attacks on Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Nazi Germany. On September 17, the Soviet Union in turn invaded Poland.\n\nAfter the Nazis tore up their pact with Moscow, two alliances battled it out: The Axis powers led by Germany, Italy and Japan and the victorious Allied forces led by Britain, the Soviet Union and the US.\n\nAlthough it has been 80 years since the war started, there were still unresolved matters according to Poland, which says Germany owes it war reparations.\n\nA parliamentary commission is currently working on a new analysis of the extent of Poland's wartime human and material losses.\n\n\"We have to talk about, remember and demand the truth regarding those losses. We have to demand compensation,\" Morawiecki said on Sunday at the Westerplatte ceremony.\n\nWhen it comes to reparations, however, Berlin believes the case is closed.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had planned to attend the war commemorations but cancelled at the last minute so that he could monitor Hurricane Dorian.\n\nForeign delegations attending included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky whose partnership matters to Poland, which believes its security depends on Ukraine remaining outside of Russia's sphere of influence.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
