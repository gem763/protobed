Kamala Harris speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nGiven the chance to confront rival Elizabeth Warren, Harris steered the conversation to \u2026 Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nKamala Harris briefly surged in the Democratic primary after after she successfully deployed a premeditated attack on Joe Biden\u2019s record on busing during the first debate. Harris faded after she backtracked on forced busing, a deeply unpopular policy no one really wants to reinstate in 2019, and then she tried to have it both ways for several months on Medicare for All, the policy at the center of the 2020 Democratic primary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Harris helped herself at Tuesday night\u2019s debate in Ohio. Given the chance to confront co-front-runner Elizabeth Warren, Harris aggressively challenged the Massachusetts senator to . . . call on Twitter to delete Donald Trump\u2019s account. Really.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBecause here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter should be held accountable, and shut down that [account]. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That\u2019s our job,\u201d Warren replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris just kept coming back to it: \u201cJoin me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump\u2019s twitter account bulls*it at a presidential debate. It\u2019s so small ball. She is bigger and better than this,\u201d former Obama-administration official Tommy Vietor wrote on Twitter. \u201cLast time I checked, he can deliver those messages without Twitter. I think this [ . . .] is a ridiculous thing to raise at a presidential debate. I\u2019m a huge Kamala Harris fan. I think she\u2019s being poorly served by whoever told her to focus on this.\u201d\n\nVietor is right, but are we sure that Kamala is getting bad advice here? When a candidate spouts an idea this ridiculous, I tend to think that\u2019s a sign the person who came up with the idea is the candidate. Or maybe a member of the candidate\u2019s family. I just find it very hard to believe that someone getting paid to work in politics told Harris that her one shot at Elizabeth Warren on a national stage between now and November 20 should focus on deleting Trump\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nHarris\u2019s Twitter flop was her most memorable contribution to the debate, but the rest of the night wasn\u2019t good for her, either. There were the forced attempts at authenticity. \u201cDude got to go,\u201d Harris said of Trump at one point. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d she said while calling for gun control. And she indignantly attacked the media for not asking a question about abortion during the first six debates. Putting abortion front and center in the primary was a strategy last employed by New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the race when she was polling at less than 1 percent. Attacking the media almost certainly works better in a Republican primary than it does in a Democratic primary. And the moderators did in fact ask a number of softball questions about abortion later in the debate, as they had planned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris isn\u2019t quite dead yet in the Democratic party, but it\u2019s getting a little late in the game for her to come back. The Iowa caucuses are in three and a half months. And the rest of Harris\u2019s debate performance didn\u2019t inspire much confidence that she knows how to turn things around.", "description": "Given the chance to confront rival Elizabeth Warren, Harris steered the conversation to \u2026 President Trump\u2019s Twitter account.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
