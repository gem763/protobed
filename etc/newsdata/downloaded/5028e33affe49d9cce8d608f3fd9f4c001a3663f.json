But, the sad part about the cafe is that there are no pandas in the cafe. No kidding!\n\nThe cafe triggered a controversy when its owner dyed Chow Chow dogs to resemble giant pandas. The owner is apparently making money out of the 'dyed dogs'.\n\nThe cafe is situated in Chengdu, China, which is home to famous Research Base of Giant Panda breeding. Named as \u2018Cute Pet Games\u2019, the cafe is home to six adorable panda cubs - at least that is what it was supposed to be. However, if you look closely, you\u2019ll get to know that these are not panda cubs, but dogs dyed to make them look like pandas.\n\nA video of the dogs is going viral on Chinese social media. The video shows cute little Chow Chow dogs dyed with black dye, to resemble pandas. While many applauded the owner for doing such a thing, a lot of people criticised the idea and pointed out that the dye could be harmful for the dogs.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nDon't Miss 1 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES\n\nAfter receiving criticism, the owner said that the dogs are \u201cvery healthy\u201d.\n\n\"Our dye was imported from Japan and very expensive. A tube of dye alone costs 800 yuan (Rs. 8,000),\" Huang said to Daily Mail. He added that the dye was 100% safe. \"Although the dogs are not real pandas, we hope our customers can experience the panda culture in our shop,\" Huang added.\n\nThe owner gave an explanation after being criticised online, but the question is why did he paint the dogs in the first place? The place was opened as Panda Cafe, then why dupe the customers by dying dogs?", "description": "Just when you think you cannot survive another hour in office, we have something really cute coming your way!
