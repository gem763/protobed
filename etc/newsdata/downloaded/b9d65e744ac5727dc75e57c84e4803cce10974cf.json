Photo: Lara Solanki/Netflix\n\nIt\u2019s been a big year for Netflix renewing shows only to reveal that those renewed seasons are also final seasons. Just last month, the streaming network announced that it had renewed GLOW for a fourth and final season, while the recently released trailer for season six of BoJack Horseman also came with the news that it would be the beloved animated series\u2019 last. Now Justin Simien\u2019s film-turned-series Dear White People has joined the club, which Netflix revealed today along with the news of a season-four renewal. The show\u2019s third season premiered in August to mixed reviews, with The A.V.
