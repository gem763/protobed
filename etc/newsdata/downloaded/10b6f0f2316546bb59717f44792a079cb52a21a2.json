I was wrong. She was right. On May 3rd, 1972, a dozen CIA assets came up from Miami with orders to incapacitate me totally. And those orders came out of the White House. So they didn\u2019t do it because they felt they were being set up as patsies. But that\u2019s why I say that this whistleblower\u2019s safety is a problem, is being in danger just as it was then.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings last month after the Trump administration tried to block Congress from seeing a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the U.S. intelligence community. The White House later released a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call that sparked the complaint, and it showed that Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart during the conversation to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a front-runner among Democrats running for president in 2020.\n\nMr. Trump and his defenders have regularly tried to attack the unnamed whistleblower\u2019s credibility in the weeks since their complaint became public and have pushed for the person\u2019s identity to be disclosed.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Whistleblower?\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter early Saturday.\n\nMark S. Zaid, an attorney representing the whistleblower, tweeted later Saturday that there is \u201cno legitimate, non-partisan reason\u201d for his client to come forward and risk exposure, adding that revealing their identity would only undermine existing whistleblower protections and deter future whistleblower from coming forward.\n\nMr. Ellsberg was charged in 1973 under the U.S. Espionage Act for his role in releasing the Pentagon Papers. All charges were dropped after it emerged months later that he had been the target of an illegal, covert operation conducted by individuals close to Nixon.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
