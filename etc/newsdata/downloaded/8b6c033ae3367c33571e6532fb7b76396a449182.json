Instead, Trump and national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien surprised the family by inviting Anne Sacoolas to the White House and suggesting Dunn\u2019s parents meet with her in front of the White House press corps.\n\nAttorney Mark Stephens told The Associated Press the couple had no idea Sacoolas would be in the building when they were there Tuesday and were stunned by the proposition. He said the couple wants to meet with Sacoolas at some point, but not in a surprise meeting staged for reporters.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be a meeting like that, it should not involve a surprise, a jack-in-the-box, pop-out-of-a-circus-tent meeting seven weeks after the loss,\u201d said Radd Seiger, a retired lawyer who is a neighbor of the family and accompanied them to the White House. \u201cFor this to happen, you would want some heavy-duty therapy and you want to meet in a neutral environment.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday that he thought the family had wanted to meet with Sacoolas, but that \u201cthey weren\u2019t ready for it\u201d Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt was very sad, to be honest,\u201d he said of their conversation. \u201cThey lost their son.\u201d\n\nTrump said he had spoken with Sacoolas and that she had been waiting in a room just off the Oval Office when he made the offer to Dunn\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t ready for it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I did offer. I spoke with Boris. He asked me if I\u2019d do that. And I did it,\u201d Trump said, referring to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \u201cUnfortunately, when we had everybody together, they decided not to meet. Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time. I don\u2019t know exactly.\u201d\n\nPressed on why he thought that was something they would welcome, Trump said that, \u201cbased on what I saw they wanted to meet. But now they say they only want to meet if they\u2019re in the U.K. And that\u2019ll be up to them. But I did meet the family, and I expressed condolences on behalf of our country.\u201d\n\nTrump also said Sacoolas told him that she had been driving on the wrong side of the road accidentally \u2014 something Trump said \u201chappens in Europe\u201d because drivers in England drive on the left side of the road instead of the right. Trump told reporters last week that he had once done so himself.\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed in August when his motorcycle collided with a car allegedly driven by Sacoolas outside a British air force base in southern England used by the U.S. military.\n\nSeiger said the family received a call from the White House on Tuesday inviting them to meet with a \u201cvery senior government official\u201d whose identity was not revealed.\n\nThey immediately got on a train to Washington. \u201cThe mood was quite buoyant. We were looking forward to it,\u201d he told the Associated Press in a telephone interview from Manhattan where the family returned after the Oval Office meeting.\n\nInstead, the family was subjected to what Seiger described as a high-pressure effort to convince them to meet with Sacoolas against their will \u2014 a characterization the White House rejected.\n\n\u201cWe were ambushed,\u201d he said of the situation, putting most of the blame on O\u2019Brien, who replaced former national security adviser John Bolton last month after serving as the president\u2019s chief hostage negotiator. \u201cWhen we said, \u2018No,\u2019 he erupted in fury in front of my poor people. This guy was a thug, and he was intimidating,\u201d Seiger said.\n\nOn the other hand, Seiger gave Trump credit for demonstrating what he believed was genuine sympathy for the family\u2019s circumstances. He held Charles\u2019 hand at one point and agreed to try to find a way to help her.\n\n\u201cHe was absolutely charming,\u201d Seiger said of Trump. \u201cHe was very warm and offered a strong handshake and embrace. He made them feel comfortable, and I was very impressed with his personal touch.\u201d\n\nBut as soon as Trump expressed his condolences, Seiger said the president immediately suggested a meeting with Sacoolas, something the family was unprepared for.\n\n\u201cVery quickly there was a change,\u201d Seiger recounted. \u201cWe\u2019re all here together, I\u2019ve got Mrs. Sacoolas here in the building, and you guys are the building. Let\u2019s all meet,\u201d he quoted Trump as saying.\n\nSeiger said the family is still emotionally vulnerable and that they were taken aback. While Trump appeared to understand their reluctance, he said O\u2019Brien continued to insist, even after they made clear that any meeting would have to happen back in Britain.\n\n\u201cFinally, I said \u2018Mr. President, this meeting is not happening today. If it happens, it will be back in the U.K.\u2019 That\u2019s when O\u2019Brien erupted, his face went all red, and I thought he was going to lunge at me,\u201d Seiger recounted. \u201cHe was sitting about three feet away from Charlotte and said angrily, \u2018She is never going back. Never.'\u201d\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham rejected that characterization and said that after the family declined the meeting \u201cno one asked again.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cintent was to do all he could to comfort the victims of a tragic accident,\u201d she said, adding that, \u201cNo one in that room was angry. It was a quiet and respectful meeting.\u201d\n\nSacoolas left Britain shortly after the crash, though police released a statement saying she had previously told them she had no plans to depart.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents have been pressing for Sacoolas to return to Britain.\n\n\u201cShe needs to come back and face the justice system. She needs to do this for herself, for us, she needs do this for her children, set a good example to her children\u2026 stand up to your mistakes,'\u201d Charles said in an interview with CBS.\n\nA statement previously released on Sacoolas\u2019 behalf said she intended to continue cooperating with authorities.\n\n\u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child, and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family,\u201d it read.\n\n___\n\nKatz reported from London.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The grieving parents of a British teenager who was killed in a car crash involving an American diplomat's wife felt ambushed when", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/ffa241_trump-us-diplomat-15185-charlotte-charles-bruce-charles-radd-seiger-charlotte-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
