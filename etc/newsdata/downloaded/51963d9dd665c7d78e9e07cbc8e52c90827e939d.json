Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He compared the latest allegations to claims that Trump worked with Russia to win in 2016. \u201cThis seems to be the same kind of deal.\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cIt would have a real chilling effect on dialogue between important leaders if they think that every time someone who overhears a conversation that wasn\u2019t even party to the conversation is going to file a whistleblower complaint and it\u2019ll end up on the front page of periodicals across the country,\u201d said Rep.

That strikes me as entirely inappropriate,\u201d said Sen. Patrick J.
