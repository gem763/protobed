The succession appeared to go flawlessly \u2014 but it was harder than ever to say what exactly the Republican Party of Texas was about. The new governor, Greg Abbott, didn\u2019t appear to want to do anything. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an eccentric suburban Christian soldier who unnerved many in his own party, immediately went to war with House Speaker Joe Straus, a moderate Jewish Republican from the leafier parts of San Antonio. Attorney General Ken Paxton was quickly indicted on a charge of felony securities fraud.\n\nBefore 2014, some Republicans sought to help undocumented Texans.
