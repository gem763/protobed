Her guess is that productivity has fallen as the population ages because the most skilled and experienced people have left in larger numbers, since they\u2019re more successful and wealthier and can afford to retire. If she\u2019s right, then it\u2019s not that workers become less productive as they age, but that the most productive ones stop working.\n\nThis means, Maestas says, that a big drop in productivity isn\u2019t inevitable. New technologies and business policies might keep talented people working longer. (Less happily, so might shrinking savings and disappearing retirement plans.) Teams made of both young and old people, with diverse experiences, might even be more productive. \u201cAre we all getting less productive, and we\u2019re stuck with that?\u201d she says. \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite all the stressing about aging,\u201d says Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist, \u201cthere is surprisingly very little evidence that aging societies are worse economically.\u201d Looking at GDP data from 1990 to 2015, Acemoglu and Boston University\u2019s Pascual Restrepo found no correlation between aging demographics and slowed economic growth. In fact, countries like South Korea, Japan, and Germany, all with rapidly aging populations, are actually doing well.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Rotman", "Technologyreview.Com S Why-You-Shouldnt-Fear-The-Gray-Tsunami"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
