Rusted goal posts overlook a closed high school. The front lawns of identical ranch-style houses have turned brown. The narrow sidewalks, just wide enough for two people, have started to crack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing the death of a hometown,\u201d said John Nowell, a 77-year-old retired U.S. soldier who moved to Yongsan in 1965, when there were still ox carts winding through the streets of Seoul.\n\nBy year\u2019s end, nearly all of the more than 20,000 U.S. troops and family members will have vacated the barracks inside Yongsan Garrison. They are relocating to the new $11 billion Camp Humphreys, America\u2019s largest overseas military base, about 40 miles south of Seoul.\n\nAs South Korea says farewell to Yongsan, the Korean Peninsula still finds itself confronting the type of military unrest that justified a massive U.S. presence following the 1950-1953 Korean War.\n\nA peace treaty, formally ending that war, remains unsigned. Pyongyang continues to engage in provocations, including a spree of short-range missiles tests last month. The U.S. and South Korea recently concluded drills meant to hone their readiness against a sudden attack from Pyongyang. Nuclear negotiations with the North remain gridlocked.\n\nYongsan, the U.S. military garrison in the South Korean capital, in June.

The move to Camp Humphreys consolidates what had been multiple U.S. camps at a single site and pushes American forces farther from the firing range of North Korea\u2019s artillery.\n\nSome of those who will stay behind are already reeling from the transition.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think the closure of Yongsan will help unite the area? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nAt the Grand Ole Opry, a country-music bar near Yongsan, a Theodore Roosevelt painting hangs on the wall along with a Confederate flag smothered with U.S. dollar bills. \u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of my regular customers,\u201d said owner Kim Sam-sook, a 78-year-old widow of an American who fought in the Korean War. She fears the establishment may have to close.\n\nLong South Korea\u2019s epicenter for Western culture, the local neighborhood surrounding Yongsan, which catered to U.S. soldiers, carried a seedy reputation. It was once home to a flourishing black market of U.S. military goods, such as mayonnaise, smuggled off base, and brothels frequented by American soldiers.\n\nThe area has cleaned up though, as South Korea\u2019s economy boomed and brought more prosperity and international acceptance. Yongsan saw its monopoly on Taco Bell burritos, Super Bowl parties and Dr. Seuss books fade.\n\nYongsan, roughly two-thirds the size of New York\u2019s Central Park, is now surrounded by high-rise apartments and glistening corporate headquarters. Blocks away from the U.S. base, diners can choose between local branches of The Halal Guys or The Original Pancake House.\n\nBut as one piece of America sinks into South Korea's history books, another is rising\u2014literally.\n\nCamp Humphreys, in the quiet coastal town of Pyeongtaek, famous for its pears and cucumbers, is almost seven times the size of Yongsan. The transition required a geological makeover of what had been a smaller U.S. outpost. The land on the base was raised by 8.5 feet to prevent flooding. Nearly 1,000 miles of telecom cable\u2014about the distance from New York to St. Louis\u2014was inserted. The base\u2019s population is expected to soon surpass 40,000.\n\nNearly all of the more than 20,000 U.S. troops and their families stationed at Seoul's Yongsan Garrison will have vacated by the end of the year.

At one of five malls, people can shop for vitamins at a GNC store or buy hiking books at a Timberland. Uniformed soldiers wolf down Philly cheesesteaks at Charleys or General Tso\u2019s chicken from Manchu Wok.\n\nThe relocation has been a welcome development for an alliance that has been troubled of late. Seoul\u2019s recent cancellation of an intelligence pact with Tokyo irked Washington, which viewed the move as hurting the U.S.\u2019s ability to deter Pyongyang, Beijing and Moscow in the region. President Trump has repeatedly called for South Korea to pay more for hosting U.S. troops.\n\nStill, more than two-thirds of South Koreans support a U.S. military presence in the future, polls say. Americans who have served in the country consider it a second home.\n\nWhile Yongsan will return to South Korea as early as next year, a small portion will remain American: the U.S. Embassy in Seoul plans to relocate there. When it does, the holdovers will be the diplomatic housing and the military-owned Dragon Hill Lodge\u2014where the hotel restaurant serves Maine lobsters and diners can pay with U.S. cash.\n\nThe new $11 billion Camp Humphreys, America\u2019s largest overseas military base, about 40 miles south of Seoul.

Some local residents argue Yongsan\u2019s central location makes it prime real estate for affordable homes, but government officials have other ideas.\n\n\u201cIt will be reborn as Yongsan Park,\u201d said Kim Hyun-mee, who heads the South Korean ministry overseeing land, infrastructure and transport, at a media event last year. The proposal for the park includes a lake and brand new subway lines below the Yongsan Garrison site.\n\nAfter more than five decades in Yongsan, Mr. Nowell, the retired U.S. soldier, likens the closure to the death of a small American factory town. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a bygone era. No more,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Andrew Jeong at andrew.jeong@wsj.com", "description": "The closure of Yongsan\u2014the U.S. military\u2019s crumbling garrison in downtown Seoul\u2014marks the end of an era for a slice of Americana. \u201cI\u2019m seeing the death of a hometown,\u201d said John Nowell, a retired U.S. soldier who moved there in 1965.", "authors": ["Andrew Jeong", "Andrew.Jeong Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103400/social"}
