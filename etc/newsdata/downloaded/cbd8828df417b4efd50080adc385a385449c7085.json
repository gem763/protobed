However, the time spent by a 10-year-old kid may have been too much for his mom as she allegedly hit him and ended up dislocating his jaw.\n\nThe incident happened Wednesday 23\n\nTV station WFLA managed to acquire a police report about the said incident where it was noted that it happened on Wednesday (October 23) at around 5 PM.\n\nThe child\u2019s mother, Ann Perugia from South Daytona, told her son to stop playing the game and take a shower.\n\nHowever, when interviewed by the authorities, the kid said that he forgot what his mother told him to do, adding that after 10 minutes, his mother went back to his room and asked him if he already took a bath. To that, he answered \u201cno.\u201d The police said that the kid already got up and made his way to the bathroom when the mother followed him.\n\nBy the time the two got inside, the child says he recalls being punched by his own mother resulting in the dislocation of his jaw. The report adds that allegedly, there were also scratches on the boy\u2019s body that may have been inflicted by Perugia.\n\nAfter the incident, Perugia called the boy\u2019s father to pick him up. The boy\u2019s father, Brian Butler told authorities that upon arrival at Perugia\u2019s house, his son was already standing outside with his shoes and a bag of clothes. The mother then went outside and told Butler to take his son and leave.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most.
