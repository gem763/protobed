On Dec.14, all previously uploaded content will be wiped away for good. \"You'll have until that date to save anything you've uploaded,\" Yahoo said in its announcement.\n\nFiles, polls, links and photos will disappear from the website along with folders, attachments and almost everything else, Yahoo said. Users will still be able to contact their group members via email.\n\nIt's a bird, it's a plane, it's a car: Porsche, Boeing pair up to work on flying vehicles\n\nInstagram launched 'Threads': A messaging app to house your intimate conversations\n\nTo save your data before Yahoo clears it, you can download it from the Privacy Dashboard. The website will live on; however, all public groups will become private or restricted and admins will have limited access to group settings and tools.\n\nThe website was meant to be an \"extension to your real-life group of friends, interests and communities,\" according to the website. Yahoo did not explain why Groups is shutting down, but the writing was on the wall for quite some time.\n\nThe online discussion board has been around since 2001 and once reported millions of users. The advent of social networking websites such as Facebook and Reddit made the platform pretty much useless for people who used apps to communicate with others.\n\nMany of the groups are old, having not been updated in years. Some are new, but other platforms are more mobile-friendly and offer greater functionality and ways to engage with people.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/17/yahoo-groups-online-forum-shutdown/4007150002/", "description": "Users of Yahoo Groups will be able to upload new content until Oct. 28.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
