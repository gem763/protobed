So we decided to do everything backwards.\n\n\"I took her family name. It was so relaxed and everyone had a great laugh. There were a few gobsmacked faces.\u201d\n\nCiara said the idea kicked off when they visited the wedding venue and she joked that he should walk down the aisle instead of her.\n\n\u201cWe decided it would be so funny. Me and Bobby can be a bit wacky and we thought if we did it, it would really break the ice and give everyone good form at the start of the day.\n\n\u201cWe wrote the ceremony as well.\u201d\n\nThey kept their plans a secret from nearly all the guests until the big day.\n\n(Image: Craig Terence Andrews)\n\nThe bridesmaids knew they would be wearing tuxedos, but the groomsmen had no idea they\u2019d be in frocks.\n\nBobby, 35, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let them try the outfits on before in case they backed out, but on the day, they loved it. They cried tears of bemusement when they saw the dresses.\n\n\u201cWe were all in hysterics. I was a size 18 and they were all 14s.\n\n\u201cCiara and the girls had no problem buying their tuxes, but we had a lot of trouble.\n\n\u201cA lot of places didn\u2019t want me to try stuff on. The bridal places we tried were reluctant, so I ended up buying online.\u201d\n\nCiara, 35, added: \u201cThe bridesmaids were fine with the suits \u2013 girls can look really good in suits.\n\n\u201cBut my brother was one of Bobby\u2019s groomsmen and he kept texting me, \u2018when are we getting our suits?\u2019. I had to say, \u2018you aren\u2019t getting one\u2019.\n\n\u201cBecause they are all hairy and tattooed, it was funnier.\u201d\n\n(Image: Trevor McBride)\n\nBobby, an HR executive from Swansea, South Wales, even persuaded his dad Linton to walk him down the aisle.\n\n\u201cWhen I told my dad what we were doing he shook his head, looked at the ground and said, \u2018What are you like?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give me a pep talk \u2013 just said, \u2018let\u2019s get this done\u2019.\n\nBobby admitted he was a bag of nerves before his appearance in front of their 70 guests in Belfast last month.\n\n\u201cWhen the door opened, everyone there erupted in applause and laughter. It really carried me down the aisle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe couple wrote most of their own vows \u2013 and exchanged balls and chains, as well as rings.\n\n(Image: Trevor McBride)\n\nBobby said: \u201cAlthough the service was quite funny and shocking \u2013 we weren\u2019t doing it to make a mockery of marriage.\n\n\u201cIt was a big thing for both of us, all the words in the service were so personal.\u201d\n\nThe couple hooked up three years ago \u2013 despite a cringe-making first meeting. Bobby was on holiday in Barcelona when he and a mate popped into a pub, where he spotted Ciara serving behind the bar.\n\nAssuming she was Spanish and couldn\u2019t understand English, he started telling his friend how much he fancied her.\n\n(Image: Craig Terence Andrews)\n\n\u201cI thought she was a sexy Spanish girl, with beautiful eyes, with a proper naughty glint in them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was chatting to my mate saying, \u2018oh, she\u2019s stunning\u2019 and it turned out she was Irish and understood everything I was saying.\u201d Bobby and his pal had only gone into the bar for one drink, but he ended up staying there all day and he and Ciara shared a kiss later that night.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with her the\n\nmoment she opened her mouth. She\u2019s got the most savage personality,\u201d he said.\n\nCiara said Bobby\u2019s infectious laugh was the main source of attraction. She said: \u201cWe just clicked straight away, we laughed so much.\n\n\u201cTo meet a partner you can laugh with all the time \u2013 I\u2019ve never been with a guy before who\u2019d wear a dress for me. He just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe pair spent thousands flying backwards and forwards between Wales and Barcelona every few weeks to see each other. They moved to Ciara\u2019s home in Donegal town, Ireland, last year and she is now eight months\u2019 pregnant.\n\nBobby proposed during a death-defying drive in the mountains with Ciara at the wheel during a Christmas visit to her family in 2017.\n\n\u201cI managed to ask her dad for her hand and he laughed and told me, \u2018good luck\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI carried the ring about with me every day for the best part of a week, waiting for the right time.\n\n\u201cAt one point on that trip, she nearly killed us. We went for a drive on New Year\u2019s Eve and the snow on the road was getting thicker and thicker.\n\n\u201cWe ended up at the top of a steep mountain road. Ciara said the only way to get off was to drive straight down the pass.\n\n\u201cI thought we were going to die and that this was my last chance to propose and tell her how much I love her, so I whipped the ring out and asked. She laughed and said, \u2018of course I\u2019ll marry you\u2019.\n\n\u201cThen she skidded her old Corolla from the top of the pass to the bottom like a pro. I was screaming all the way.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Couple decide to do everything backwards in a wacky ceremony after bride Ciara refuses to walk down the aisle, and groom Bobby takes her last name", "authors": ["Helen Whitehouse", "Image", "Craig Terence Andrews", "Trevor Mcbride"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20729448.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROD-Bobby-and-Ciara.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
