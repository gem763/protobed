Now, Frey describes the visible shoots of an added uprising against robotization:\n\nIn a draft paper he co-authored in October, Frey linked automation anxiety and Trump's 2016 election: Support for Trump was greater in areas of relatively high adoption of robots. And lower adoption would have swung Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin to Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn a study by Pew Research last May, 72% of those surveyed said they were worried about automation.\n\nAndrew Yang, a New York technologist, has predicated his presidential candidacy on ringing the alarm about AI and robots.\n\nWhat resistance may look like: In the Industrial Age, Frey said, people rioted against automation. This time will be different, he said. \"Now people have political rights and can vote against automation,\" he said.\n\nThe bottom line: \"What form resistance will take, I have no idea,\" Frey said. \"But if the record is any guidance, there will be resistance. The tendencies show there will be.\"\n\nGo deeper: In August, Frey pushed back against researchers attempting to poke holes in his 2013 paper that he wrote with fellow Oxford University Professor Michael Osborne.", "description": "A leading researcher talks about \"automation anxiety\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/oc70MokY2iT048HEUiVffKjA6MQ=/0x0:3200x1800/1920x1080/2018/04/18/1524077695341.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-18"}
