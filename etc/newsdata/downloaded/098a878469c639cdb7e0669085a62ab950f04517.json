The firm demonstrated the technology at CES this week, showing how users can choose from 500 pre-loaded designs or upload their own images for custom prints\n\nWhile there were a few hiccups (mostly due to an existing layer of darkish nail polish from a pre-CES manicure), the system was able to quickly print a picture of this reporter\u2019s ferret, Pickles\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK? The system comes with 500 pre-loaded images, or you can upload your own through the connected app. Once you've selected the image you want, apply the base layer and cure it in the UV, then apply the print layer. After curing the second layer, put your finger in the printer and get started. It uses smart nail identification to put the design in the correct place. The printing process itself takes just about 30 seconds, and then you have to seal it with the top coat.\n\nAnjou showed off its Laser Nail Printer at the VAVA booth in the Las Vegas Convention Center.\n\nIt works much like a standard gel manicure \u2013 at least, in the first few steps \u2013 requiring you apply a base layer and printing layer that must each be cured under UV light.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, you select your image and put your finger under the printer.\n\nDailymail.com tested out the printer on the show floor.\n\nWhile there were a few hiccups (mostly due to an existing layer of darkish nail polish from a pre-CES manicure), the system was able to quickly print a picture of this reporter\u2019s ferret, Pickles.\n\nThe system uses smart nail identification to put the design in the correct place.\n\nAll if this is displayed on a small screen on top of the device, which lets you view the progress of your print as it\u2019s completed.\n\nIt works much like a standard gel manicure \u2013 at least, in the first few steps \u2013 requiring you apply a base layer and printing layer that must each be cured under UV light\n\nThe printing process itself takes just about 30 seconds, while the entire process from start to finish lasts about 5 or so minutes, with the UV curing time taken into account.\n\nIt works best with bright, basic designs that have clear definition, though it\u2019s also capable of taking more intricate images, from pet pictures to family portraits.\n\nAnjou says the Laser Nail Printer will be available in February.", "description": "Anjou unveiled a tabletop device that can print any picture on your nails in 30 seconds.
