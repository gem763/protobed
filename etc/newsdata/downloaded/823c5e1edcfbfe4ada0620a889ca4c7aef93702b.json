While it does have a high annual fee of $595, you get a lot in return, from annual statement credits for airline incidental fees and Dell purchases to airport lounge access to complimentary elite status with Hilton and Marriott.\n\nBusiness Platinum offer details\n\nThe card is now offering an elevated welcome bonus of up to 100,000 Amex Membership Rewards points. It's divided into two tiers:\n\n50,000 points after you spend $10,000 in the first three months\n\nAnother 50,000 points after you spend an additional $15,000 in the first three months\n\nThis is a limited-time welcome offer, only available until December 4, so make sure to apply by that date if you're interested.\n\nTo earn the full bonus, though, we're looking at $25,000 in spending in three months. If your business is on the small side or you're just starting out, that sum may not be reasonable \u2014 and we strongly advise against spending more than you can comfortably afford just to earn points. But if your business can easily rack up at least $25,000 in expenses in three months, the Business Platinum's current offer is a great way to maximize your spending.\n\nRead more: The best small busines credit cards\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nHow much is this offer worth?\n\nTravel website The Points Guy values Amex Membership Rewards points at 2 cents apiece, so 100,000 points would be worth $2,000. That valuation factors in the various ways you can use these points. The most valuable redemption options are available by transferring points to Amex travel partners, which include airlines like Delta and Virgin Atlantic and hotels such as Hilton and Marriott.\n\nYou can also redeem your Amex points for travel directly through the Amex Travel website, and as a Business Platinum cardholder, you're eligible for a 35% points rebate when you pay with points to book first-class or business-class flights, or any class of service with your selected qualifying airline (you get to select one each year).\n\nBusiness Platinum Amex card benefits\n\nThe Business Platinum card earns 5 points per dollar on flights and prepaid hotels booked at Amex Travel, and 1.5x points on purchases of $5,000 or more (up to one million additional points per year). It earns 1 point per dollar on everything else. Other business credit cards are generally a better option for your company's smaller daily expenses, but the Business Platinum can be a lucrative choice if you're booking travel through Amex.\n\nOther card benefits include:\n\nUp to $200 in airline incidental fee credits each year\n\nOne year of Platinum Global access from WeWork if you enroll by December 31\n\nUp to $200 in Dell statement credits each year\n\nAirport lounge access via the American Express Global Lounge Collection \u2014 Centurion Lounges, International American Express lounges, Priority Pass Select lounge membership, Delta Sky Club access when you're flying Delta\n\nUp to $100 credit to cover the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck\n\nComplimentary Hilton Gold status\n\nComplimentary Marriott Gold status\n\nRead more: Amex Business Platinum review", "description": "If you want a business credit card with luxury travel perks, the Amex Business Platinum is a great choice.
