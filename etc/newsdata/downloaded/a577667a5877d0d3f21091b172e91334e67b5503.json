Again there could be downside risk here.\"\n\nDiscretionary items are set to be the main contributors to the inflation figure, with a rise in both domestic and international travel set to contribute 0.3 percentage points in the quarter according to Westpac.\n\nANZ's Hayden Dimes expects the drought could have some inflationary effect on food.\n\n\"We expect fruit and vegetable prices to add to inflation, increasing 1.5 per cent,\" Mr Dimes said. \"Wholesale prices suggest fruit prices are up sharply, more than offsetting the fall in vegetable prices. With the ongoing drought, there is some upside risk to food inflation.\"\n\nTobacco and alcohol prices also expected to have risen during the quarter and Commonwealth Bank is expecting them to contribute 0.11 percentage points to Wednesday's print.\n\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia economist Gareth Aird expects the September quarter to become the 15th consecutive quarter of below-target core inflation - the Reserve Bank's preferred measure - which he said will at least help those households experiencing low wage growth.\n\n\"For workers, modest wages growth is outpacing inflation so real wages are in positive territory,\" Mr Aird said.", "description": "Price falls in some of the biggest household budget items are expected to\u00a0restrain headline inflation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.042%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ea855eb1eea6f9619637ac2faaf8ba5afe6de526", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
