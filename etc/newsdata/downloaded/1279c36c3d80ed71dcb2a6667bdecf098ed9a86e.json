If a house that serves as collateral for a home-equity loan is destroyed in a hurricane, banks will be less likely to lend in that community, and that means consumers will have less money to spend, the report said.\n\nTo devise an estimated dollar figure for this impact, Cornerstone Capital synthesizes climate change research from the Economist Intelligence Unit, the London School of Economics, and the UNEP Finance Initiative, to conclude that US$3 trillion to US$24 trillion in global financial financial assets are at risk.\n\nWhile investors may not be able to hide from these risks, there\u2019s much they can do to mitigate the effects of climate change, and lesson the harm to financial assets.\n\n\u201cLiterally, everyday it gets easier to create a diversified climate-aware or climate-targeted portfolio for any size investor, from small to large,\u201d says Craig Metrick, managing institutional consulting and research at Cornerstone.\n\nMetrick spoke with Penta about how individuals can invest to address climate change, drawing from a separate report the firm also published this month.\n\nAccess to Investments\n\nInvesting solely in renewable energy companies or electric vehicle makers would be a valid approach for investors who want to take action on climate. But Metrick says not every investor will want a portfolio of only clean tech or renewable energy investments.\n\nInstead, Cornerstone suggests taking action on climate through a series of \u201caccess themes,\u201d that are part of a framework the firm developed to help clients find investments that align with the various sustainable development goals (SDGs) identified by the United Nations in 2015. \u201cClimate Action\u201d is SDG No. 13.\n\nWhat the access themes do is make the SDGs \u201cmore investor- and investment-friendly,\u201d Metrick says. \u201cIt allows us to better capture the intersectionality of some of these issues.\u201d\n\nAccess to sustainable sources of food and nutrition, for example, \u201cis not just important for nutrition and human health, it\u2019s also better for the climate,\u201d he says.\n\nThese themes, including \u201caccess to education,\u201d or \u201caccess to clean air,\u201d \u201callow clients to take a more holistic approach to their investments and maybe create a more diversified portfolio,\u201d Metrick says. But the approach \u201cstill gets to the issues and impacts that they are looking for.\u201d\n\nBeyond Solar Energy\n\nOne example Metrick gives is a venture-capital fund the firm is in the process of recommending to its clients that doesn\u2019t bill itself as a climate solutions fund, but the themes it is investing in\u2014the environment, education, and mobility\u2014will drive climate action.\n\n\u201cIf you put those [themes] together, you really get a sense for things that can improve life in urban areas, and if you look at some of the solutions that they are targeting, they could have a tremendous impact on more sustainable communities as well as a huge impact on resource use,\u201d Metrick says.\n\nEducation is critical because \u201cyou need an educated population to understand the science and to have the knowledge and the economic wherewithal to seek solutions,\u201d he says.\n\nOne of this fund\u2019s investments offers online learning and support for working mothers to get additional education for their children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a direct link to reducing emissions, but over time, we do think a greater level of education in the developing world, and for women, can improve the way people understand and interact with their environment,\u201d Metrick says.\n\nThey are also investing in solutions to reduce food waste, such as a companies that can make use of food that is past its peak food date. \u201cReducing food waste is a huge one for the climate,\u201d Metrick adds.\n\nStocks, Bonds, Alternatives\n\nCornerstone also details how investors can select investments among stocks, bonds, or alternatives, to achieve action on climate\u2014in other words, it\u2019s possible to create a diversified climate action portfolio.\n\nA client could invest in an equity real-estate investment trust (REIT), for example, that invests in companies providing farmer-friendly leases and mortgages to organic farmers. For bonds, investors can choose funds investing in companies emphasizing energy efficiency, renewables, mass transit, and carbon capture, for example, or a fund that provides financing to solar projects.\n\nAlternative investments, including real estate, private equity, and venture capital, can often allow investors to make a more direct impact, such as a real assets fund \u201cthat buys farmland in the U.S. in regions near markets with strong demand for locally grown, organic food,\u201d or a private-equity fund focused on climate infrastructure projects.\n\nSome of the strategies Cornerstone describes are new or emerging, but there\u2019s no doubt, Metrick says, that the landscape of potential investments, both public and private, is changing constantly.\n\n\u201cYou name it, it\u2019s coming,\u201d he says.\n\nTo Metrick, it\u2019s important for clients to consider some of the newer approaches, too, \u201cbecause without that we\u2019re not going to get the impact we need,\u201d he says. \u201cNot every client wants to shoulder the risk of a brand-new strategy, but we don\u2019t want to dismiss things solely because they don\u2019t have a three-year track record or a US$100 million portfolio.\u201d", "description": "Cornerstone Capital\u2019s Craig Metrick on how to align a diversified portfolio to stem climate change", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107957/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
