These glasses are a far less ambitous project and will be similar to Snap's Spectacles, which allow users to record video.\n\nFacebook is developing a voice assistant \u2014 like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa\u2014 in tandem with the its smart glasses. Orion and Stella wearers would be able to communicate with the glasses using this voice assistant, CNBC reported about Orion and The Information reported about Stella.\n\nOrion could come to market between 2023 and 2025, according to CNBC. These dates are pushed back from an originally scheduled launch of 2020, a launch date a source told Business Insider in January.\n\nFacebook has run into the challenge of reducing the size of Orion to something palatable to potential wearers, a source who has worked on Orion told CNBC. As for the Stella glasses, the partnership with Luxottica is helping Facebook determine whether people are keen to wear a Facebook-branded product, a source familiar with the project told The Information.\n\nFacebook and Luxottica declined to comment.\n\nRead more: Facebook is restructuring its augmented-reality glasses division as it inches closer to launch\n\nFacebook moved hundreds of employees from Facebook Reality Labs, which focuses on research, to an AR product team, Business Insider reported in January.
