She\u2019s connected to, and well known in, the community. She\u2019s not denying anything. But she just says this is who I am and I don\u2019t have to justify it to anyone.\u201d\n\nThat combination of integrity, accessibility and one-for-all sportsmanship reminded former AFL commissioner Gabrielle Trainor of another former number one for whom Roland Garros had been her maiden grand slam: Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who had mentored and inspired Barty.\n\n\u201cAsh takes you back to the golden days when those qualities were the norm,\u201d she said. As did women\u2019s sport more broadly, from the winning Australian cricket team to AFLW, women\u2019s rugby and the World Cup-losing, but still rigorously embraced, Matildas.\n\nTrainor, who had been instrumental in launching the AFL Women\u2019s league in 2017, gave a glimpse of the nine-tenths of the iceberg that had only recently become visible. \u201cIt\u2019s an overnight success that\u2019s been a century in the making,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWomen have played Australian rules really seriously for about 40 years. It was just entirely off the radar. There weren\u2019t pathways for young girls as there are now. The AFL made a seminal decision to accelerate the start of the competition from 2020 to 2017 and now one in every 25 women and girls in Australia has played our game at some level, from AusKick or club to senior levels.\u201d\n\nEllyse Perry, who has been hailed as the greatest woman cricketer of all time, is sixth on the list. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nThat \u201cgrassroots cultural change\u201d meant football was becoming \u201clike ballet\u201d, said Enoch, a rite of passage that tended to become a lifelong passion. And just where that kind of grassroots movement could lead was symbolised by 2019\u2019s sixth place-getter on the cultural power list, Ellyse Perry. This year\u2019s power panel took place on the day of the final test of the Women\u2019s Ashes \u2013 which date back to the 1930s \u2013 in Bristol, from which Perry would again emerge top player and scorer. When she was just 16, Perry became the only Australian to play in successive cricket and football world cups. Twelve years later, she has been hailed as the greatest woman cricketer of all time by no less an authority than England\u2019s celebrated former captain, Charlotte Edwards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program, hours before the final test of the Women\u2019s Ashes, Perry had given her take on what was proving so uniquely galvanising about women\u2019s sport in this country right now. \u201cAll of a sudden, particularly in Australia, we have this whole new set of athletes and teams that a lot of people have never been exposed to before,\u201d Perry said. \u201cIn a lot of ways, there\u2019s a bit of innocence or purity to it, because it\u2019s so new.\u201d Panellist and PwC partner Russel Howcroft said what Perry could not: \u201cEllyse Perry and her teammates are teaching the male side the appropriate way to play cricket because the men have already shown what\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThat nostalgia for a prelapsarian state \u2013 before the darker corners of the global business that is sport became a byword for everything from corruption to rape culture \u2013 was seen as a key driver of our embrace of the sister codes that could still be enjoyed relatively innocently. And the fact that so many participants played more than one sport harked back to the era of the talented amateur. \u201cWomen\u2019s football is played at community grounds,\u201d Trainor said. \u201cAnd women\u2019s sport is played with the original passion,\u201d agreed Enoch. \u201cIt\u2019s teaching us so much in so many ways as an invitation to participate in society differently.\u201d\n\nBrownlow Medallist and former Australian of the Year Adam Goodes would articulate the precise opposite of that original passion \u2013 and Perry\u2019s undiluted enthusiasm for her sport \u2013 a fortnight later, in a rare interview coinciding with the The Final Quarter commercial TV premiere. \u201cMy love for the game died inside of me in those final years of \u2026 playing,\u201d Goodes said. \u201cI don\u2019t watch any AFL these days\u2026 There\u2019s nothing, today, that \u2026 makes me think I would like to be back in AFL circles.\u201d\n\nFormer footballer Adam Goodes is in second position on the list. The ordeal which drove him to retire from the game he had once found joyous is depicted in the documentary, The Final Quarter. James Brickwood\n\nThat was the upshot, even four years on, of his extraordinary ordeal at the hands of sections of the sporting public, not least the relentless booing \u2013 the catalyst for which had been Goodes\u2019 calling out of a 13-year-old girl who had called him an \u201cape\u201d \u2013 that drove him in 2015 to retire from a game he had once found joyous. Darling\u2019s documentary is entirely made up of archival footage from the time, unmediated by context or commentary.\n\nAustralian racism had been hoisted on its own petard, the panel felt, and what was most startling was just how instinctive and casual it had been shown to be. So instinctive it wasn\u2019t even recognised as racism.\n\nWithin two months of its premiere \u2013 to a standing ovation \u2013 at this year\u2019s Sydney Film Festival, The Final Quarter had jumpstarted the \u201cdebate we didn\u2019t have at the time\u201d, as Darling said he had intended it to.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible that these two studies of one extraordinary player and man have come out at the same time. \u2014 Amanda Duthie, South Australian Film Corporation\n\nHalf a million people watched its commercial TV premiere on Channel Ten a month later. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it four times and I\u2019ve sobbed every time,\u201d said Trainor, a sentiment apparently shared by Collingwood president Eddie Maguire, who in 2013 suggested on air that Goodes be used to promote King Kong, the musical.\n\nThe day after its broadcast on Ten, Maguire described watching the film as \u201cconfronting\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking\u201d \u2013 and urged everyone to see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo weeks later, a second documentary, Stan Grant\u2019s The Australian Dream, opened the Melbourne Film Festival. As Adelaide Film Festival head Amanda Duthie said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that these two studies of one extraordinary player and man have come out at the same time. The Final Quarter is a pure examination of media and social media impact, whereas The Australian Dream is much more classically a biopic or documentary, with Adam and other players giving context. You need both, because you can come out of The Final Quarter realising the despair that can be created by the crowd and the media. When you hear first person from Adam in The Australian Dream, you realise that there is hope through family and community and a better way forward.\u201d\n\nFor Enoch, a Murri man, that underlined a fundamental difference between white and black world views. \u201cA non-Indigenous sensibility often sits in the deficit model,\u201d he said. \u201cIt often says, \u2018let\u2019s focus on articulating the problem as well as we can for maximum impact\u2019. Whereas the whole argument about Indigenous self-representation is that we know we have a responsibility to the next generation.\n\nIf you only tell them the bad news and if you don\u2019t give them a sense of hope, they will take their lives. An Aboriginal sensibility says you have to see the whole, the next day, the light at the end of the tunnel and how to get to it.\u201d\n\nAnd thereby lay another story seen as hugely important in the past year: men\u2019s mental health, and the slew of major contenders who had gone public with their struggles. AFL star Buddy Franklin took temporary leave before the 2015 finals; NSW cricket captain Moises Henrique revealed he had stepped down as captain in 2017 due to clinical depression and anxiety; former Rabbitoh Greg Inglis revealed he had checked himself into a mental health facility in May; and St Kilda\u2019s Jack Steven stepped away from AFL for a couple of months before making a triumphant return in August.\n\nAs we move into a more fluid understanding of gender, it\u2019s allowing men to be more comfortable being vulnerable. \u2014 Russel Howcroft, PwC\n\n\u201cThe AFL, NRL, professional-sport context has traditionally been aggressively male, which makes the bravery of those men, who\u2019ve been brought up in that environment, to come out and say they\u2019ve got issues all the more remarkable,\u201d said Howcroft. For Trainor, that was part of a broader \u201credefinition of what it means to be a man and a woman today\u201d. That redefinition also included gender fluidity more broadly, which had become an increasingly mainstream conversation in the past 12 months, Havilah pointed out.\n\n\u201cAnd as we move into a more fluid understanding of gender, it\u2019s allowing men to be more comfortable being vulnerable,\u201d agreed Howcroft. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer pressure to play to type.\u201d\n\nTo Enoch, it was part of the \u201cinvitation to participate in society differently\u201d that women\u2019s sport had come to represent: the opportunity to \u201clet go of the toxic masculinity that\u2019s often defined behaviours in sport, to be freed and say, \u2018Actually, I don\u2019t have to be what my grandfather used to be\u2019.\u201d Or vice versa in the case of Tayla Harris, the AFLW footballer (and unbeaten professional boxer) who kicked a killer goal from the 40-metre line \u2013 and got trolled for being \u201cunfeminine\u201d when 7AFL posted a photo. Harris \u201cturned the tables deliciously\u201d, as Trainor said, not only retweeting the image \u2013 \u201cHere\u2019s a pic of me at work ... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals\u201d \u2013 after 7AFL took it down, but also issuing the #TaylaKickChallenge.\n\nAlmost immediately, social media was flooded with images of women and men, girls and boys, attempting to replicate that balletic punt \u2013 with very mixed success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, the numbers taking up Enoch\u2019s \u201cinvitation to participate differently\u201d made it difficult to single out just one individual. Particularly as the cultural power list\u2019s first and second place-getters had both also battled their demons.\n\nGoodes headed for his country of origin, the Flinders Ranges, to be healed after hitting rock bottom mid-season 2015. A year earlier, Barty, depressed and lonely, had quit tennis as an 18-year-old junior Wimbledon champion to think about her future \u2013 and play cricket. Which is when she\u2019d received a text from Goolagong. \u201cHey darl,\u201d it said. \u201cGood decision. Go and wet a line.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the inspiring positive outcomes of both stories were the hopeful note the panel wanted to sound, taking a leaf from the First Nations rule book, which is also why Barty leads this year\u2019s list in a unanimous vote \u2013 for rare and collective joy. Which, along with the fact that laughter is the best cure for what ails us, brings us to 2019\u2019s third placegetter.\n\nTom Gleeson had been hell-bent on pointing out that Australian TV\u2019s emperors and empresses were scantily clad, if not downright nude, as part of his 2019 Logie campaign, whether they found it funny or not. He\u2019d successfully campaigned for Ten\u2019s Grant Denyer to win the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television at last year\u2019s 60th-anniversary event, even though \u2013 or rather because \u2013 Denyer didn\u2019t have a program at the time. This year, he went one better, launching his own #Gleeson4Gold bid, complete with attack ads and axing Hard Quiz (\u201cchucking a Denyer\u201d) to fuel the campaign.\n\nPlacing third on the cultural power list is Tom Gleeson, who calls his Gold Logie a victory for quiet Australians. Louise Kennerley\n\nIn his acceptance speech, wine glass in hand, Gleeson said his victory was a win for \u201ctaking the piss\u201d and \u201cnot giving a shit\u201d, before telling his industry audience to \u201clighten the f--- up\u201d, something many in the room were visibly having difficulty doing. As Gleeson said: \u201cThere has been a lot of concern that I\u2019m turning this award into a joke. But what you are forgetting is I\u2019m a comedian \u2013 I love jokes.\u201d In a sense, he could be seen as the alternative, antic face of this year\u2019s Power cover boy, Prime Minister Scott Morrison. And as fulfilling the jester\u2019s essential function: exposing the folly and pretension of any court, be it Australian politics or Australian TV. \u201cDo I have any regrets?\u201d Gleeson asked rhetorically on the night. \u201cNo, I got a result. I\u2019m like ScoMo on election night \u2013 this is a victory for the quiet Australians.\u201d The PM had indeed been his inspiration, he said later. \u201cI stayed on message and did as much media as I could, and I had heaps of self-belief.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same sort of comedic performance, and engagement with and subversion of what we think a quiz or talk show or interview should be. \u2014 Amanda Duthie\n\nThe last ABC \u201cpersonality\u201d to win gold had been Norman Gunston back in 1975, a more innocent era in which the Logies were still in their teens and TV in its heyday. And that was precisely the illustrious comedic tradition Gleeson was evolving for 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s a direct line back to things like the Ern Malley affair and Gunston,\u201d said Duthie. \u201cIt\u2019s the same sort of comedic performance, and engagement with and subversion of what we think a quiz or talk show or interview should be.\u201d And like all good humour, Gleeson\u2019s punchline was serious \u2013 which may have been why so many in his audience looked wounded.\n\n\u201cThe most compelling part of his speech was when he said: \u2018When we see each other, we don\u2019t say \u2018I love your show\u2019 anymore, because we\u2019re not watching broadcast TV, we\u2019re watching Chernobyl\u2019,\u201d said Drummond. \u201cGleeson was picking up on the fact that audiences have become so atomised that there aren\u2019t as many shows that are huge, galvanising public events anymore. This year Seven and Nine didn\u2019t get a single Logie. They all went to the ABC.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, that atomisation had also been what had allowed Gleeson to game the system; it was vulnerable.\n\nTo Howcroft, the joker in this year\u2019s pack also exemplified two trends that had emerged from last year\u2019s discussion. The first was innovation in an art form at which Australia had always excelled. \u201cComedy is really tough now. It\u2019s very, very hard to know where to take it,\u201d he said. In that context, Gleeson had \u201cgiven us another storyline, something original\u201d, much as last year\u2019s seventh placegetter, Hannah Gadsby, had subverted stand-up itself \u2013 revealing not only the self-loathing that fuels it but the darkness that fuels that self-loathing \u2013 in Nanette, the show that propelled her to global fame.\n\nRight back to our convict days, our anti-authoritarian streak has said, \u2018Let\u2019s just screw with the system'. \u2014 Wesley Enoch\n\nThe second trend was the emergence of a new warrior class adept at galvanising and harnessing the fluid, radical currents and channels that constitute new power \u2013 another phenomenon captured in last year\u2019s list \u2013 not least social media. As Howcroft said: \u201cMore and more, being brave in the media is something you get rewarded for. Trump is media brave. Boris Johnson is media brave. Scott Morrison is media brave and Tom Gleeson is definitely media brave, which is why it worked. The public said, \u2018This is great fun. Let\u2019s pile on and game it and see what we can do to disrupt things.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat too was part of a richly Australian tradition, as Enoch saw it. \u201cRight back to our convict days, our anti-authoritarian streak has said, \u2018Let\u2019s just screw with the system.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s why the system\u2019s there: for us to screw,\u201d Howcroft agreed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing in America with Trump,\u201d Drummond added. \u201cThrowing a spanner in the works. Saying, \u2018The system has not worked for me. I haven\u2019t had a pay rise since the credit crunch. I\u2019m going to vote for the guy who\u2019s not qualified and doesn\u2019t seem presidential.\u2019\u201d And as Enoch pointed out, that was true from the broad mass of \u201cpeople who say \u2018the system is against us\u2019\u201d, all the way to a single individual at the opposite end of the spectrum, \u201cwho\u2019d said, \u2018the system\u2019s not working, I need to intervene somehow\u2019.\u201d\n\nPhilanthropist Judith Neilson made last year\u2019s list because her White Rabbit Gallery of Chinese art exemplified a flowering of privately funded contemporary art galleries across Australia. This year she makes it for her subsequent and breathtaking $100 million gift to found an institute of journalism. Recipients of its recently announced first round of grants include the ABC (for a project on media literacy), The Australian (which will create a new series of reports on China), The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age (for employing Indigenous journalists and a trainee photographer) and the Financial Review (which will reopen its Jakarta bureau).\n\nJudith Neilson, whose $100 million gift will found an institute of journalism, is in seventh place, moving from ninth in 2018. Alina Gozin'a\n\n\u201cAs editorial strategies track data on what people are clicking on, which isn\u2019t necessarily what is important or most worthy of attention, she\u2019s funding areas that are missed,\u201d said Drummond. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge amount of money and media is new terrain for philanthropy in Australia. It\u2019s been very big in America, where the disruption from technology has been much greater, but it\u2019s now happening and it\u2019s allowing us to do things we otherwise couldn\u2019t.\u201d It was also quintessentially cultural and quintessentially powerful. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that an individual with money decides to fill a hole for the right reason,\u201d Howcroft said. \u201cIt should be celebrated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course the other person who had intervened \u2013 individually and powerfully \u2013 to point out what he saw as important principles missing in the status quo was Australian rugby star Israel Folau, who earlier this year used his Instagram account to remind \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolators\u201d that the fiery furnace beckoned.\n\nIn fourth place is Israel Folau, who intervened \u2013 individually and powerfully \u2013 to point out what he saw as important principles. Steve Christo\n\n\u201cWhen you look at how we define cultural power, a man whose actions have energised a significant portion of Australian society squarely fits,\u201d said Trainor. For evidence of that broad support, you didn\u2019t need to look further than the $700,000 Folau had raised on GoFundMe before the appeal was closed down \u2013 or the $2 million subsequently raised from 20,000 people via the Australian Christian Lobby. Attorney-General Christian Porter, too, had made it clear that the religious freedom legislation drafted by his office would deal with a Folau-style situation.\n\nThe devout Christian had become the face of the inevitable reaction to the gay marriage victory \u2013 for which Alan Joyce had taken out second position last year in recognition of his pivotal role. There was no doubt Folau had been a lightning rod in 2019 \u2013 and again from the pulpit of the field.\n\nAnd on the subject of faces and lightning rods, and sporting fields for that matter: Ben Quilty, the artist from central casting, who not only smashed a knee and shoulder playing amateur soccer this year, but, at just 45, added a three-city, career survey show to a singularly impressive CV. From his early smash-hit Torana and budgie paintings, to his official war artist posting in Afghanistan and trustee role at the Art Gallery of NSW, Quilty is seen as the boy with all the toys in Australian art. What propelled him onto this year\u2019s list, however, wasn\u2019t the show so much as the reaction to the Good Weekend profile (written by this author) that coincided with its opening in Adelaide in February, particularly the cover image of Quilty in a crown of thorns.\n\nNinth-placed Ben Quilty is seen as the boy with all the toys in Australian art. Tim Bauer\n\nThe crown was the photographer\u2019s idea. But even the whiff of a crucifixion tapped a hitherto unsuspected depth of feeling \u2013 in a field in which average incomes are marginal and falling last time anyone bothered to check \u2013 about everything from Quilty\u2019s commercial success to his outspokenness on social issues. \u201cHe\u2019s had a massive 12 months, including a big survey show and the crown, which was hugely controversial in the visual arts world,\u201d said Havilah. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to compare it with the sport narrative, which is about making sport more broadly accessible through connecting it to social issues. This was the inverse: people viewed Ben as using social issues that he cares about, obviously, to commercialise and promote his practice.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s way more powerful because it\u2019s actually coming from his own history. \u2014 Lisa Havilah, Powerhouse Museum\n\nParticularly as Quilty had spoken eloquently on many of the issues now galvanising sport, not least race, gender and the toxic masculinity and mental health issues, that he\u2019d witnessed growing up in Sydney\u2019s west. As Havilah said, the reaction showed not only that it didn\u2019t pay to be the biggest fish in a pond that was tiny and increasingly dry, but also that \u201cwhat we can say now from positions of privilege has completely shifted. When Ben talks about the men [he grew up with and the soldiers he has spent time with in Afghanistan], he\u2019s way more powerful because it\u2019s actually coming from his own history.\u201d\n\nThe other thing that had felt unusual, Havilah said, was \u201cfor the visual arts to be present in the broader narrative\u201d, which brings us to this year\u2019s fifth place-getter, the National Gallery of Victoria\u2019s director, Tony Ellwood. \u201cThe number of people engaging with the NGV is amazing,\u201d Havilah said. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the consistent strategy Tony would have had to apply to engage people at that level.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his seven years as director, Ellwood has doubled NGV attendance from 1.57 million to more than 3.2 million and launched both Melbourne Design Week, now the country\u2019s largest, and the blockbuster NGV Triennial \u2013 attended by 1.23 million people last year, an NGV record. And the government is backing him. Last year Premier Daniel Andrews announced the Victorian government would build Australia\u2019s largest contemporary art gallery, NGV Contemporary, behind the NGV.\n\nNational Gallery of Victoria director Tony Ellwood, in fifth place, encapsulates classic, old-style cultural power. Kristoffer Paulsen\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the reinvigoration and renewal of that institution but thinking about the next big step,\u201d said Havilah. In that, Ellwood encapsulated classic, old-style cultural power, added Drummond. \u201cHe\u2019s in a position of power, which gives him the opportunity to do a lot of things, and he\u2019s absolutely making the most of it. What is so clever is the way he\u2019s stitched something like his design festival into the objectives of the Andrews government, which has strategies around Melbourne as a manufacturing hub and a creative state. He\u2019s thought about the linkages and bolted the NGV onto where the government is taking the state.\u201d\n\nTony should be there as a symbol of where contemporary art now sits within people\u2019s lives and the broader contemporary consciousness. \u2014 Lisa Havilah\n\n\u2018I agree,\u201d said Trainor. \u201cAnd Martin Foley has been a great advocate for the arts\u2019 role in retaining Melbourne\u2019s position as the cultural capital. The Victorian government takes it so seriously and it puts our other governments to shame.\u201d Ellwood also had form. His Melbourne playbook directly replicates what he did to popularise contemporary art and drive engagement with younger audiences in Queensland a decade ago.\n\nOf course, the rise of contemporary art has been a global phenomenon, particularly since Britain\u2019s Tate Modern opened in 2000. But just how significant the art of our times had become in this country was underlined in April when New York\u2019s The Art Newspaper named Sydney\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art the most visited contemporary art gallery in the world. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been him alone but Tony should be there as a symbol of where contemporary art now sits within people\u2019s lives and the broader contemporary consciousness,\u201d said Havilah. \u201cYes, it\u2019s become such a normal thing to do on the weekend, people are going just before the footy,\u201d said Trainor.\n\nOur final two cultural power list placegetters emerged from the thorniest passage of this year\u2019s discussion: the question of who was telling Australian stories in a way that moved the dial beyond the sporting arena.\n\nDuthie nominated The Sapphires producer Rosemary Blight, whose 2019 slate has included Top End Wedding, co-written and starring Miranda Tapsell, and the Helen Reddy biopic, I Am Woman, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last month.\n\nNot only was Blight one of Australia\u2019s most respected producers but she had consistently and for years enabled very Australian stories to be told, Duthie pointed out. In the end, though, neither of her most recent projects had quite broken through, whereas the second season of Big Little Lies, the US TV series based on Australian writer Liane Moriarty\u2019s novel, was the biggest story in town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show had helped put Nicole Kidman \u2013 who executive-produced and starred \u2013 back on the cover of Vanity Fair and back at the top of her game. \u201cShe\u2019s managed her career so successfully that she\u2019s got more power than ever,\u201d said Drummond. Although Duthie argued that Kidman\u2019s collaborator, Australian producer Bruna Papandrea, wielded more power. \u201cBruna is a force for diversity and delivers a platform to female creatives.\u201d\n\nEighth place-getter Nicole Kidman has managed her career so successfully that she has more power than ever. AP\n\nAnd given the sporting field had become the theatre for Australian stories defining our times, what of theatre itself? Was the strutting and fretting on Australian stages similarly defining us \u2013 or even cutting through? \u201cIt does seem like a very closed circuit,\u201d said Enoch of the theatre scene. \u201cBut the power of the theatre is that it\u2019s a cauldron of ideas. It may not be playing to millions of people. But the hundreds of thousands of people that go to theatre are people who are engaged in political and social debates. It\u2019s the R &D end of things and it does trickle down.\u201d\n\nTrainor nominated Kip Williams, artistic director of the Sydney Theatre Company, for picking up issues of masculinity and gender fluidity in a spate of gender-blind casting, including Mia Wasikowska in the STC\u2019s August production of the boy\u2019s-own classic, Lord of the Flies, and Eryn Jean Norvill in the lead role for its production next year of The Picture of Dorian Gray.\n\nIt is the right story \u2013 about migration, how we treat asylum seekers and those we consider \u2018other\u2019 \u2013 to be telling right now in Australia. \u2014 Wesley Enoch\n\nThen there was S. Shakthidharan\u2019s Counting & Cracking, which had made a clean sweep of July\u2019s Helpmann awards, taking out seven gongs, including best new Australian work. This year\u2019s equivalent of Cloudstreet or The Secret River \u2013 or the Mahabharata for that matter \u2013 the epic tells the multigenerational story of Sri Lankan immigrants to Australia and had \u201ctaken a decade to get up\u201d, said Enoch, who had included it in this year\u2019s Sydney Festival, adding: \u201cThe reason it has grabbed everyone\u2019s attention though is that it is the right story \u2013 about migration, how we treat asylum seekers and those we consider \u2018other\u2019 \u2013 to be telling right now in Australia. There\u2019s a real sense that it was a story we needed to hear.\u201d\n\nNo one doubted the courage of Belvoir St Theatre artistic director Eamon Flack, who bet the house on the production. \u201cI would say that if this hadn\u2019t been a success, he would no longer be in a job and that company would be in trouble,\u201d Enoch said.\n\nBut the play had only been seen at the Adelaide and Sydney festivals, with what will undoubtedly be a hugely important comeback run at least a year away.\n\nIn the end, the person the panel settled upon as best representing theatre\u2019s power as the research lab of culture in 2019 was Kate Mulvany, who had won the Helpmann for best actress for playing the ultimate toxic male, Richard III, in Bell Shakespeare\u2019s 2017 production. This year she had starred in Every Brilliant Thing at Belvoir St, Foxtel/Lingo Pictures\u2019 Lambs of God and the upcoming US Amazon series The Hunt \u2013 and also adapted Ruth Park\u2019s The Harp in the South for Sydney Theatre Company. \u201cShe\u2019s a triple threat,\u201d said Duthie. \u201cShe\u2019s a performer, a writer, a director.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the fact that Mulvany \u2013 who was born with renal failure due to her father\u2019s exposure to Agent Orange in the Vietnam War \u2013 did all of that \u201cin absolute, crippling agony\u201d only made her more compelled and compelling. \u201cIt drives her,\u201d said Enoch. \u201cAll those early years in hospitals gave her this outsider perspective on things and this work ethic. She just goes in and makes it happen.\u201d Like the cricketer who played soccer, the tennis player who fishes and batted, or the AFL player who boxes, a can-do female slashie who commands both stage and screen \u2013 and has turned tribulation into triumph \u2013 looked a lot like the face of cultural power in 2019.\n\nKate Mulvany, who rounds out the top-10 list, commands both stage and screen.
