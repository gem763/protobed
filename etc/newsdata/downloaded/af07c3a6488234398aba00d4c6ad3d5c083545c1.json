The industry pin-up, Australia's Future Fund which has returned 10.4 per cent a year over the past decade, had $25.7 billion in private equity as at June 30 for a 15.8 per cent allocation.\n\nThe twin exits will no doubt have Affinity's local team looking to re-stock its investment portfolio. Velocity and TEG were the firm's two biggest Australian investments.\n\nMeanwhile two of Affinity's rivals, KKR and TPG Capital, are progressing plans to list their online real estate classifieds business on the ASX boards.\n\nAs Street Talk reported on Monday, KKR and TPG-backed PropertyGuru will seek to raise up to $380.2 million for its initial public offering via the sale of 84.5 million to 93.3 million securities at $3.70 to $4.50 each.\n\nThe price represented 9 to 10.9 times forecast revenue for the 2020 calendar year.\n\nThe deal valued PropertyGuru at $1 billion to $1.22 billion on an enterprise value basis and would see its trading on the ASX with a market capitalisation worth $1.16 billion to $1.36 billion.\n\nSecurities sold at the IPO would represent a 30.1 per cent to 32.2 per cent stake in the company, according to terms sent to potential buyers.", "description": "Affinity Equity Partners has made more than 3\u00bd times its money investing in Velocity Frequent Flyer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4374%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_870%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3ee617a72fdf95c8d10acda34c5c991451784935", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
