(Google Maps)\n\nThe university has spent $3 million over two years on changes, he added.\n\nGertler said setting up permanent barriers in the Bahen Centre is a complex process.\n\n\"It's a large, complicated building,\" he said, noting considerations air circulation and the need for a specialized design.\n\n\"We had to get permissions and permits ... and we have to then have the suppliers manufacture the materials,\" he added.\n\n\"These are all custom produced to fit that particular space. It turns out to be a much more involved and time consuming process than we had anticipated.\"\n\nGertler did not confirm that the student died by suicide on Friday and said the university respects the wishes of the family who has lost a loved one when such a death occurs. He added the school acknowledges that a suicide has occurred when the family of the victim wishes the school to share the news.\n\n\"Of course, we do acknowledge the importance of talking about the issue of suicide amongst young people and young adults in this country. And that's something that we have started to talk about quite openly on this campus,\" he said.\n\nHe expressed condolences to the family of the student who died.\n\n\"Well, the entire university views this as a huge blow. Our sympathies go out to the family. We can only imagine what they must be experiencing at this time. We express our sincere condolences and deep sympathies,\" he said.\n\nStudents can get help right away if in distress\n\nGertler said the university has \"done a lot\" to improve the availability of its mental health services in the past several months. For example, he said, it rolled out same-day counselling services at its Health and Wellness Centre on the St. George campus this fall for students in extreme distress. The centre is also \"triaging our cases more effectively\" to provide services faster.\n\n'The entire university views this as a huge blow. Our sympathies go out to the family. We can only imagine what they must be experiencing at this time. We express our sincere condolences and deep sympathies,' President Meric Gertler told CBC News. (CBC)\n\nThe university also has increased the number of counsellors it has on staff and contracted out to specialized companies to add personnel quickly, Gertler said.\n\nIf a student walks into the centre, he or she could receive help right away, he said.\n\n\"If our professionals determine that they are in extreme need, they can be seen immediately. That same-day availability is really critical,\" Gertler said.\n\n\"We are also doing our level best, at every opportunity, to get the news out about other forms of support that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so when students need help they know where to turn.\"\n\nGertler said the problem is a challenging one and the school may turn to the province for financial help.\n\n\"We are a university, we're not a health care institution, and yet the kinds of demands that have been coming our way, as a result of this growing need from our student body, have been exponentially increasing. Our budgets have not.\"\n\nGertler said the university is aware that students are angry in the wake of the latest death.\n\n\"Our first concern is for the well-being of our students,\" he said. \"Obviously, we need to do everything that we can to ensure their success, to ensure their physical and emotional well-being as well. And we want to make sure that they know where to turn when indeed they have the need for more support.\"", "description": "The\u00a0University of Toronto's president\u00a0says the school should have erected temporary safety barriers sooner in a computer science building where students and a union active on campus say a student died by suicide last Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303781.1569895715!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/meric-gertler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
