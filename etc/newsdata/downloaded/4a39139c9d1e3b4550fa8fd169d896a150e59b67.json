The people asked not to be identified because the matter is still private.\n\nThe agreement is likely to help buy more time for a wider industry settlement in other opioid cases. McKesson, Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen, which together control 90% of the U.S. drug-distribution market, have proposed an $18 billion settlement for more than 2,000 other lawsuits filed by states, counties and cities, according to people familiar with those negotiations. No deal has been reached on that offer.\n\nThe settlement is expected to be announced in court later on Monday, said the people. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., the last remaining defendant, hasn\u2019t yet reached a deal so far, said the people. The trial scheduled for Monday is likely to be canceled. A separate trial, involving claims by West Virginia municipalities, is scheduled for next year.\n\nShares of the companies fell slightly before the markets opened in New York. McKesson dropped 1.6%, AmerisourceBergen was down 1.3%, Cardinal lost 0.1% and Teva declined 0.3%.\n\nOpioid Defendants\n\nThe people said the settlement deal was reached at midnight after weekend-long talks in Cleveland. Other defendants in the case brought by the Ohio counties had already settled.\n\nLast week, drugmaker Johnson & Johnson agreed to settle the Cleveland case for $20.4 million. J&J has separately offered $4 billion to settle all the opioid lawsuits against it.\n\nLast month, generic-opioid manufacturer Mallinckrodt Plc settled for $30 million. A unit of Endo International Plc offered to pay $10 million and donate $1 million worth of drugs to avoid the trial, and Allergan Plc agreed to pay $5 million.\n\nMore than 400,000 Americans have died of opioid overdoses over two decades as U.S. addiction rates surged, and local communities have sued to recover expenses on more drug treatment and police services.\n\nDrugmakers and distributors have been accused in thousands of lawsuits of turning a blind eye to red flags about unusually large opioid shipments and employing lax compliance standards to rake in billions in profits. The lawsuits are being overseen by U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland.\n\nThe companies have been in talks with states, cities and counties in hopes of reaching an overarching agreement to resolve all the litigation.\n\nThe case is In Re National Prescription Opioid Litigation, 17-md-2804, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio (Cleveland).\n\n(Updates with detail of trial schedule)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jef Feeley in Wilmington, Delaware at jfeeley@bloomberg.net;Riley Griffin in New York at rgriffin42@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, ;Drew Armstrong at darmstrong17@bloomberg.net, Steve Stroth\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The three largest U.S. drug distributors and a major generic-drug manufacturer have agreed to pay more than $250 million to settle the first federal trial over the companies\u2019 role in fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic.Drug distributors McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and Americanization", "authors": ["Jef Feeley", "Riley Griffin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pWTia4CjXLwYQo3Chb7yyw--~B/aD0yNjQzO3c9Mzc5NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/5243c1b224f501a5c3115e3922fe37f7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
