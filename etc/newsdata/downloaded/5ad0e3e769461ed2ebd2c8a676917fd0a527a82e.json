Brighter skies across Northern Ireland and parts of southwest Britain following to all but parts of southeast England and northeast Scotland. Scattered showers will affect Northern Ireland and western Scotland.\n\nTonight:\n\nRemaining rain clearing, leaving many areas clear and rather chilly; a few fog patches in the north and east. Showers in parts of the west will tend to turn heavier\n\nThursday:\n\nSunshine at times for most, especially in the north and east. However showers will become more frequent and heavier, mainly in parts of the south and west, perhaps with thunder.\n\nOutlook for Friday to Sunday:\n\nBreezy and unsettled Friday and Saturday, with heavy showers, especially in the south and west. Showers becoming confined to southern areas Sunday, with perhaps more persistent rain in the north.", "description": "The Met Office predicts four days of thundery weather in the UK, with the first lightning strikes expected tomorrow", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588744.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_LIGHTNING_STRIKE_050079975.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
