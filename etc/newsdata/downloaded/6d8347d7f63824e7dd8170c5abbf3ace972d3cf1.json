Armed groups crossed the Sahara desert and started a campaign in northern Mali which has since spread across the Sahel region to Niger, Chad and other countries.\n\n190820015154761\n\nBurkina Faso lies between central Mali and western Niger - two of the most unstable areas in the Sahel. The country is also plagued with ethnic conflicts largely between farming and herding communities.\n\nCompaore had managed to keep his country safe by giving leaders of the armed groups a safe haven - something the subsequent government led by President Christian Kabore refused to do.\n\nOn our trip to the north, we saw many homes that had been deserted. In one village where we stopped to film, it appeared people had left in a hurry. Food was still on plates outside a house. Pots, pans, waters jars were scattered everywhere and goats were tethered in a shed.\n\nAll along the route, our police escorts were nervously firing their weapons - this was very dangerous territory and the further north we went, the more hazardous it became.\n\nWe did, however, find an area where some people had recently returned.\n\nGuienbila is one of the larger villages in the area. It has never been attacked but many of its residents have escaped anyway. Those we talked to said neighbouring villages are frequently ambushed and pillaged.\n\nGuienbila was our last stop. By this time, the police were openly jittery.\n\n\"We have to leave, we have information that certain groups know you are here,\" the commander told us barely 10 minutes after our arrival.\n\nSo we left behind people who were afraid of what might happen to them but determined to reclaim their lives.\n\nMany are fleeing their village in the north of the country to escape a worsening security situation [Al Jazeera]\n\nUp to 500 people have been killed in Burkina Faso in the past few years, including in the capital, Ouagadougou, where hotels have come under attack.\n\nThe violence has forced approximately 270,000 people in the east and north, including the Sahel region, from their homes, while schools and health facilities have been shut down.\n\nThe displaced have sought refuge in camps run by the government and aid agencies or schools. Many have also been welcomed and hosted by locals in safer areas - such is the hospitality of the Burkinabe people.\n\nA day after our trip up to the north, our security detail told us that 15 people had been killed after a minivan carrying them drove over a landmine in the same location we were filming abandoned villages.\n\nFourteen others were killed after an ambush on a convoy of tricycles carrying food aid about 50km away.\n\nThat information brought home the point of how volatile the situation is - it shook us and scared us.\n\nYet many people whose lives have been devastated live through these horrors every day.", "description": "Authorities struggle to tackle a worsening security situation that has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.", "authors": ["Catherine Wambua-Soi", "About The Author"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/20/6211be247a0340d18c0b53163b20addc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
