In his new role this magnificent boyo, still in his absolute prime, plays Donizetti\u2019s Don Pasquale, a doddery old miser. Pasquale is a part for a master patter merchant, and trying to get his tongue around some extremely tricky comic business, Bryn shows he is not quite the equal of buffo baritones like Alessandro Corbelli.\n\nBut Corbelli doesn\u2019t sing Wotan, whereas Terfel does. His extraordinary versatility is rightly making him the stuff of legend.\n\nHere Terfel shares the honours with the conductor Evelino Pid\u00f2, whose phrasing of the overture (played, thankfully, with the curtain down) is an absolute joy.\n\nBryn Terfel as Don Pasquale shows he is not quite the equal of buffo baritones like Alessandro Corbelli and the Russian soprano Olga Peretyatko looks good and sings well\n\nThe supporting cast is Covent Garden\u2019s usual motley, multi-national crew, without a single Italian. The Russian soprano Olga Peretyatko, making her debut, looks good and sings well but without any real idiomatic feel for this music.\n\nSimilarly, the Romanian tenor Ioan Hotea is possessed of a pleasingly accurate high tenor voice but one entirely lacking in romantic allure or the merest taste of Italian honey.\n\nIT'S A FACT Don Pasquale is a prime example of 'opera buffa', or comic opera, based on the stock characters from commedia dell'arte.\n\nAs for Markus Werba\u2019s Malatesta, he\u2019s an experienced international baritone but why import an Austrian when there are plenty of outstanding British baritones on the Northern Line?\n\nThe Italian director Damiano Michieletto\u2019s William Tell provoked outrage with a gratuitously violent sexual assault on a woman with a broken bottle. His later, Olivier Award-winning Cav and Pag was much better, as it needed to be.\n\nThis expensive-looking modern setting of Pasquale is also properly house-trained, containing little or nothing to raise your blood pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s mainly good fun, and why not in these dark times? It\u2019s in the cinemas on Thursday. Do go.\n\nDon Pasquale, Royal Opera House Live cinema season, October 24, roh.org.uk\n\nALBUM OF THE WEEK\n\nJonas Kaufmann Wien Sony, out now\n\nRating:\n\nThis imaginative album from Jonas Kaufmann contains not just Viennese music but Viennese songs and arias about the city. It\u2019s very well sung, with only a few signs of the vocal problems that have afflicted him in recent years.\n\nIt\u2019s also well accompanied by the Vienna Philharmonic under Ad\u00e1m Fischer and, at 78 minutes, is excellent value.\n\nThe Johann Strauss items include few of the usual suspects. The only well-known aria is Franz Leh\u00e1r\u2019s Lippen Schweigen from The Merry Widow, a duet with Rachel Willis-S\u00f8rensen.\n\nThis imaginative album from Jonas Kaufmann contains not just Viennese music but Viennese songs and arias about the city\n\nIt\u2019s good to be taken off the beaten track with two songs by Robert Stolz, the last of the waltz kings, and items by unknowns, at least to me, such as Rudolf Sieczynski and Hans May.\n\nMay\u2019s two songs come from a 1935 movie starring the ill-fated tenor Joseph Schmidt, who died aged just 38.\n\nThe second of these, Es Wird Im Leben\u2026 is very touching and shows that Kaufmann is happy to engage with Austria\u2019s murky past, as well as its joyous one.\n\nHe ends with another Jewish composer, Georg Kreisler and his cynical view of Vienna where, as Kaufmann says, \u2018Kreisler illuminates his Vienna and his Jewish roots with a healthy dose of sarcasm.\u2019", "description": "Is Bryn Terfel growing up too quickly?
