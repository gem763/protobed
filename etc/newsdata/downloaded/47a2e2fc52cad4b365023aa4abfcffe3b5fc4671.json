'What has he got to be depressed about?'\n\nStan Collymore regularly opens up on his own battle with mental health on social media\n\nTo this day it troubles me that nobody challenged him, nobody told him mental illness does not discriminate.\n\nEqually, I am sure that were it to happen today, somebody would have. Times have changed a little.\n\nA shame, then, to listen to Alan Brazil and Ian Holloway on talkSPORT last Monday morning.\n\nDiscussing this column's mention of Mario Balotelli and the lengths staff at Manchester City once went to in a bid to ease his clear unhappiness in England, Brazil and his guest were quickly in to man-in-the-pub mode.\n\nAccording to Holloway, Balotelli was 'mad as a frog' while Brazil described the young Italian as a 'screwball' who 'needs a shrink'.\n\nAlan Brazil has influence and the damage caused by his archaic flippancy is blatantly clear\n\nHolloway has a good record in managing players and one would hope his comments weren't indicative of character.\n\nAs for Brazil, I wouldn't claim to know or greatly care. But what we do know is that his show is talkSPORT's flagship with listenership on the rise.\n\nSo Brazil has influence by way of profile and audience, and the damage caused by such archaic flippancy is clear. And it really is a shame because it comes at a time when football, slowly, is taking steps towards becoming more enlightened.\n\nA friend of mine in the game \u2014 once a manager of high standing \u2014 has had a few troubles in this area recently but quickly discovered there was no shortage of people or structure in the game to help him.\n\nWith the assistance of the League Managers Association, he has been guided to the right professionals and is already feeling better. To his surprise, nobody in the game scoffed or laughed at him. Maybe 30 years ago but not now.\n\nInstead, he has been sent self-help books to read and his phone rings regularly. Colleagues of mine in the media have been quietly kind to him as well.\n\nIan Holloway said Mario Balotelli was 'mad as a frog' while Brazil said he was a 'screwball'\n\n'It has made me realise that maybe I didn't have as much sympathy with these things back in my day,' he told me this week.\n\n'Football used to sweep stuff like this under the carpet. I now know that it shouldn't have.'\n\nCollymore's own battle goes on to this day. A talented broadcaster in his own right, the former Liverpool forward uses his profile to invite other sufferers to contact him on social media if they need help.\n\nSo does former Liverpool goalkeeper Chris Kirkland, who suffered desperately with mental health issues towards the end of his own career.\n\nIndeed, it was on the same talkSPORT station that I first heard Kirkland talk about his problems last season. It was intensely powerful radio. Professional football is a tough, unforgiving environment.\n\nChris Kirkland suffered desperately with mental health issues towards the end of his career\n\nMany are not resilient enough to make it and that's OK. Depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions should never be confused with feeling a little fed-up after losing a cup final or suffering a relegation.\n\nThose lines help nobody if they become blurred.\n\nBut, just as importantly, trivialising footballers' problems, and those whose job it is to help them, is a cheap trick.\n\nWe should have called it out in that car park two decades ago and we should call it out now.\n\nOWEN'S SLIDING DOORS MOMENT\n\nBuried on page 348 of Michael Owen's biography is a tale to interest every Manchester United fan worn down by Glazer ownership.\n\nThe story of Sir Alex Ferguson's feud with Irish racing magnates John Magnier and JP McManus over Rock of Gibraltar is well known and was discussed on this page two weeks ago.\n\nAfter the men fell out over stud rights to the horse, Magnier and McManus sold their United holding stake to the Glazers.\n\nWhat was not known until now is that the two men approached Owen with an identical proposal first. 'They wanted to give me a horse, to run in my colours,' reveals Owen. 'On the understanding it would benefit them in terms of publicity.'\n\nOwen says the approach was made in 1999 or 2000 and he declined it on the advice of his agent.\n\nIt was in August 2001 that Ferguson was officially registered as part-owner of the Rock. It subsequently ran in his colours. Had Owen accepted, maybe the Irish would not have approached Ferguson at all.\n\nIf so, there would have been no argument and, possibly, there would have been no Glazers at Old Trafford. It is all hypothetical but it is some thought.\n\nMichael Owen's autobiography contains a tale in relation to the Glazers' ownership of United\n\nGOOD WEEK\n\nChris Wilder\n\nSheffield United's win at Everton was timely given the Yorkshire club now have a new owner from the Middle East. Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia says he would be 'crazy' to change his manager so that means Wilder is safe. Doesn't it?\n\nBAD WEEK\n\nMarc Kosicke\n\nThe agent of Jurgen Klopp suggested his client may leave Liverpool unless 'climate change brings better weather to England'. Klopp dismissed it as 'German humour'. Remind me never to go to watch stand-up in Munich.", "description": "IAN LADYMAN COLUMN: I recalled this week a dispiriting off-the-record conversation I was party to 20 years ago between a well-known football manager and a group of journalists.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/22/22/18796120-0-image-a-10_1569186378398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
