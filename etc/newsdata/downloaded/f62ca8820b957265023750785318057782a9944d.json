Pictures)\n\nThis story includes spoilers for the plot of the movie and book versions of \u201cThe Goldfinch.\u201d\n\nMaking a movie out of \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d always seemed like a perilous proposition. Donna Tartt\u2019s 2013 novel is nearly 800 pages long, with myriad plot points that unfold around the globe, not to mention hyper-detailed ruminations on art, aesthetics, fate, drugs and wood grains. Aspects of the Pulitzer Prize winner are clearly cinematic \u2014 the story begins with a dramatic explosion at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, after all \u2014 but how could a director distill so much down to a manageable two-to-three-hour experience?\n\nThe answer might have been to streamline the narrative: Pick out a few strands of the story and focus on those, while letting, for example, a subplot involving Theo\u2019s tony friends the Barbours fade into the background. Director John Crowley and screenwriter Peter Straughan went the opposite direction. All of the major plot points from the book are here, shoved into the story like antiques packed into a restorer\u2019s studio. (Nicole Kidman was cast as Mrs. Barbour, which may explain why the family becomes an even more dominant part of the narrative.) The response hasn\u2019t been positive; nearly every critic panned the movie. So what went wrong? It all goes back to what the movie left out. Here\u2019s a look:\n\n[Movie review: \u2018The Goldfinch\u2019 won the Pulitzer Prize, but the film version is a bomb]\n\nThe emotion\n\nWhile the movie retains the book\u2019s key moments, it shuffles the order. Both the novel and the movie begin in Amsterdam, with Theo Decker as an adult (played by Ansel Elgort) in the middle of a mysterious crisis, before jumping back in time to the day his mother died, transforming the trajectory of his life. The book takes the time to show the closeness between Theo and his mom with various scenes of the two together, but the movie doesn\u2019t even reveal Audrey Decker\u2019s face until the very end.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange choice. The story\u2019s emotional trump card is Theo\u2019s heartbreak over the loss of the person he loves most in the world. Even one quick scene of mother and son over takeout Chinese food could have established the pair\u2019s connection. Instead, the movie focuses solely on the aftermath, only showing Audrey and Theo together at the end of the movie during a flashback at the museum. There, she explains her love for the Goldfinch painting, as if it\u2019s some kind of big reveal.\n\nThe causes and effects\n\nA theme that pops up again and again in the book is how quick decisions and unexpected turns of events can completely alter a life. But again, the out-of-order plot of the movie undermines the message. Filmgoers see Theo snorting drugs without any understanding of how he became an addict and why. The decision lends an air of mystery to the movie, but it\u2019s at the expense of the book\u2019s powerful domino effect that starts when Theo leaves New York for Vegas and becomes exposed not just to the downers that his father\u2019s girlfriend feeds him on the cross-country flight but the self-destructive sway of Boris, whose friendship \u2014 and diet of beer, drugs and sugar-covered bread \u2014 become irresistible to Theo.\n\n\n\nOakes Fegley as young Theo Decker. (Warner Bros. Pictures)\n\nThe painting\n\nIn the book, when Theo isn\u2019t looking at the painting that he stole from the Met after the explosion, he\u2019s thinking about it. It\u2019s a constant source of anxiety and fascination but also solace. Even though it leads to the movie\u2019s dramatic climax \u2014 an extremely confusing shootout in the Netherlands \u2014 it barely makes an appearance here, aside from one moving scene when Theo (played as a child by Oakes Fegley) curls up with the newspaper-wrapped artwork on the ground of his Vegas bedroom, clearly aching for his mother.\n\nThe importance of the painting feels like an afterthought. The piece\u2019s charmed existence (it survived not one but two explosions) is revealed late in the movie and, again, the work\u2019s importance to Theo isn\u2019t explained until the movie\u2019s final moments.\n\nThe details\n\nThe sheer amount of highly specific explanation \u2014 about an antique chest-on-chest, an abandoned desert cul-de-sac, the interiors of a drug den, you name it \u2014 is either what makes Tartt\u2019s novel brilliant or what makes it infuriating, depending on your taste. Either way, there\u2019s a feeling of expansiveness, of taking the time to examine and get at the essence of an object, place or emotion. There\u2019s no time for that in the movie. Because Theo is busy hopping from Manhattan to Vegas and back again, before taking flight for Europe \u2014 while also falling in love, getting jilted, finding his father, losing his father, getting engaged, learning a trade, finding someone to adopt him, finding someone else to adopt him, getting tangled up with some unsavory characters and killing a man (just for starters) \u2014 there\u2019s not much time for contemplation.\n\n\u201cIn my dream world, they would have made this a four-part miniseries,\u201d actress Sarah Paulson, who plays Xandra in the movie, told Deadline, \u201cwith each section having its own evening event, just so that you could mine everything in this book.\u201d\n\nOr, at the very least, the most important stuff.", "description": "Director John Crowley and screenwriter Peter Straughan dutifully include every plot point.", "authors": ["Stephanie Merry", "Book World Editor", "September At Am", "Stephanie Merry Oversees Books Coverage For The Style Section.
