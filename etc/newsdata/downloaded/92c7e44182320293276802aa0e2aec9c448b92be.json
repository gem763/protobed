One coal plant official told the local media that a shield meant to prevent coal powder from escaping out of the factory had malfunctioned \u2014 however, toxic black snowfall seems to be a regular phenomena in the area and it isn\u2019t necessarily tied to a single source. [The Frozen North: Stunning Images of Russia from Above]\n\n\"It\u2019s harder to find white snow than black snow during the winter,\u201d Vladimir Slivyak, a member of the non-profit environmental action group Ecodefense, told the Guardian. \"There is a lot of coal dust in the air all the time. When snow falls, it just becomes visible. You can\u2019t see it the rest of the year, but it is still there.\"\n\nKuzbass (short for Kuznetsk Basin) is one of the largest coalfields in the world, spanning more than 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers), according to Britannica.com. A 2015 report from Ecodefense found that the citizens of Kuzbass have an average life expectancy 3 to 4 years shorter than the Russian national average and have nearly twice the risk of contracting tuberculosis and childhood mental disorders.\n\nBlack snows like this one are a frequent winter feature in the region, the report found, and mitigation attempts have been\u2026 lacking. For instance, in December 2018, regional authorities were accused of trying to hide the toxic black stuff by literally painting over it with white pigment, the Moscow Times reported.\n\nSiberia, which would be the world's largest country by size if it were a sovereign nation, is no stranger to bizarre environmental disasters. In July 2018, a Siberian factory town was drenched in a red \"blood rain\" when improperly stored industrial waste was caught up in a storm. Later that month, a mysterious wall of dust blacked out the sun for 3 hours in Yakutia, a region that contains some of the coldest cities in the world.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, several British groups have proposed boycotting Kuzbass coal until the region enacts stronger environmental protections, The simple fact is, however, that there\u2019s no great way to make coal use environmentally friendly. Even if black snow isn\u2019t falling in your part of the world, remember \u2014 carbon dioxide released by coal plants remains a leading cause of climate change.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.", "description": "Don't eat the black snow.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RWtbDvoaSspKW674tiCoYW-1200-80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-15"}
