Chaos and destruction will hit the region in its entirety.\"\n\nAbdul Mahdi emphasised the importance of resolving the long-running conflict in Yemen as a prelude to achieving regional peace.\n\nTruce in Yemen\n\nOn his part, Larijani said that Iran has called on Yemen's Houthi rebels to accept any ceasefire agreement with Saudi Arabia, adding that this would also be in the interest of Riyadh.\n\nThe Houthis have been locked in a war with a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since 2015.\n\nThe tension between long-time foes Saudi Arabia and Iran flared up recently following a Houthi-claimed attack on two key oil facilities in the kingdom's east.\n\nThe US, European powers and Saudi Arabia blamed the attack on Iran, which denied any involvement.", "description": "Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani tells Al Jazeera Tehran welcomes crown prince's preference to resolve issues over talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/47eaca2b0ce04593b767dae63d543a0f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
