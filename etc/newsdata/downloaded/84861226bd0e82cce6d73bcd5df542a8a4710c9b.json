On Wednesday, the Swedish automaker said the car will mark another first, too: it will be the first Volvo car with an infotainment system built on Google\u2019s new embedded Android Automotive software.\n\nThat means the new electric XC40 will come with features and apps like Google Assistant and Google Maps built in, with no need for an Android smartphone. The SUV\u2019s infotainment system will also have access to the Play Store, allowing owners to download apps that Google\u2019s approved for automotive use.\n\nBuilt-in maps, assistant, and Play Store \u2014 no phone required\n\nWe\u2019ve known for more than two years that Volvo was working on integrating Android into its cars. In fact, Google showed off an early version of the software running on a gas-powered XC40 at its 2018 I/O conference. Now, this won\u2019t necessarily be the first car with embedded Android, nor will it be the first all-electric in the wider Volvo Group. Volvo\u2019s performance sub-brand Polestar has claimed both of those titles with its Polestar 2 EV, which is slated to go on sale in 2020. But Volvo\u2019s XC40 is a more affordable, higher-volume car that will reach more customers.\n\nThe deep integration of Android will allow drivers and passengers to use Google Assistant to change things like climate settings, and it will also enable over-the-air updates that can add new features or address some maintenance issues, according to Volvo. And yes, Google and Volvo\u2019s system will allow people to plug their iPhones in and use Apple CarPlay.\n\nWhile all of this added functionality will make for a different experience compared to what is currently available inside a Volvo car, the new infotainment system will still look familiar to anyone who\u2019s used the automaker\u2019s existing Sensus software.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the main goals of this whole partnership model Google\u2019s pursuing. The tech giant provides a reliable software backbone, which each automaker gets to develop and brand to their liking. Beyond Volvo, Google\u2019s also signed up big names like General Motors and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. It\u2019s a far cry from a few years ago when automakers were so hesitant to let tech companies take over any small slice of the in-car experience that many slow-rolled their initial adoptions of Android Auto and CarPlay.", "description": "The new all-electric XC40 SUV will operate Google\u2019s embedded version of Android Auto, offering drivers and passengers access to Maps, Assistant, and the Play Store \u2014  all without requiring the use of a smartphone. And yes, it will still work with Apple CarPlay.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xX6OQvDkq4e83Iee9aPz0fH9xxY=/0x365:5100x3035/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19273533/258977_Fully_electric_Volvo_XC40_introduces_brand_new_infotainment_system.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
