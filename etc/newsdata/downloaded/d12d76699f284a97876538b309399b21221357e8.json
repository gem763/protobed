Add Interest\n\nGuyger, who is white, walked into the apartment belonging to Botham Jean, who is black, on Sept. 6, 2018, allegedly believing it was hers. Guyger was still wearing her police uniform when she fired two shots at Jean, who was eating ice cream in his unlocked apartment.\n\nGuyger, who was fired from the Dallas Police Department weeks after the shooting, is charged with murder.\n\nTom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP\n\nGuyger, speaking calmly and quietly, testified Friday that she mistakenly parked on the wrong floor that night; she said the parking floors at her apartment building were not clearly marked.\n\nShe also said there were problems getting the door to lock completely at her apartment.\n\nTom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP\n\nWhen Guyger, then 30, put the key into the lock that night, she noticed the door was open. Jean, an accountant for the international auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, was sitting on his couch when Guyger walked in, prosecutors said.\n\nJeff Montgomery/Harding University via AP\n\nBefore Jean could take a few steps toward the door, Guyger leveled her gun and fired twice, Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus said.\n\n\"No opportunity for de-escalation, no opportunity for him to surrender. Bang, bang. Rapid,\" Hermus told the jury in his opening statement.\n\nHermus said Guyger's apartment was directly beneath Jean's fourth-floor unit. Not only did Guyger mistakenly park on the wrong floor of the complex, she walked down a long hallway, passing 16 different apartments but failed to realize she was not headed to her front door, Hermus said.\n\nHermus said Guyger appeared to be planning a rendezvous with her police partner and lover. Hermus showed the jury text messages Guyger sent her partner moments before the shooting and argued that during that communication, Guyger became distracted and confused about where she was.\n\n\"In the last 10 minutes of Bo's life, Amber Guyger made a series of unreasonable errors, and unreasonable decisions, and unreasonable choices -- the kind of choices and decisions that only she could have stopped,\" Hermus said.\n\nJeff Montgomery/Harding University via AP\n\nDefense attorney Robert Rogers said in his opening argument that Guyger was exhausted from working 40 hours in four days, including a long overtime shift helping a SWAT team arrest three robbers.\n\nHe described the configuration of the apartment complex, where Guyger had lived for about two months, as \"a confusing place\" with floors in the parking garage and apartment doors not clearly marked.\n\nTom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP\n\nHe painted the picture of Guyger entering the apartment and seeing the figure of a large individual inside coming toward her, yelling, \"Hey! Hey!' and drowning out her orders for him to show her his hands.\n\n\"After this incident, the investigators interviewed and learned that 93 tenants had unintentionally parked on the wrong floor,\" Rogers said.\n\nHe said another 46 tenants who lived on the floors where Guyger and Jean resided had gone to the wrong apartment and placed their key in the door.\n\nRogers denied that Guyger was planning a rendezvous that night with her partner, calling the prosecution's assertion \"speculation.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.
