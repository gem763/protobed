They fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious.\"\n\nHas the fighting stopped?\n\nThe Turkish-declared pause followed talks in Ankara between Mr Erdogan and Mr Trump's Vice-President, Mike Pence, on Thursday.\n\nAll fighting was to halt for five days and the US was to help facilitate the withdrawal of Kurdish-led troops from Turkey's \"safe zone\" along the border.\n\nHowever, while the Kurds agreed to cease firing in the area between the border towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad, where combat had been fierce, they said that other areas had not been discussed.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Smoke from shelling rose over Ras al-Ain on Friday\n\nShelling and gunfire could again be heard in Ras al-Ain on Friday morning.\n\nThe Turks get what they wanted\n\nThe agreement brokered by the Americans does not define a \"pause\" in Turkish military operations but the US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said it meant no forward movement of troops on the ground, and no military action other than self-defence.\n\nThis applies to the swaths of Syrian land the Turks have invaded in the last week, about a quarter of the territory they ultimately want for a safe zone. Already they have forced some of the Kurdish fighters out but there are still pockets of strong resistance.\n\nThe Kurdish commander, General Mazloum Kobani, said the rest of his forces would retreat from this zone. But, he added, a ceasefire for other parts of the border would have to be discussed. Syrian soldiers have moved into much of it because the Kurds turned to Damascus for help after their US allies left.\n\nThe Syrians and their Russian backers were not at the negotiating table, so how they respond will help determine whether the agreement is sustainable. But for now it has essentially given the Turks what they were trying to achieve with the military operation: a zone on the Syrian side of the border, clear of Kurdish militias, that they control with their armed forces.\n\nThe Turks have agreed to make the \"pause\" permanent if the Kurdish fighters leave, but there is no demand for their soldiers to pull out.\n\nWere war crimes committed?\n\nNearly 500 people have been killed since the offensive started, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Some families fleeing the fighting in Syria have found shelter in Kurdish parts of Iraq\n\nThese include 224 members of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and 183 Turkish-backed rebels but also 72 civilians, according to the SOHR.\n\nAmnesty International says it has gathered \"damning evidence of war crimes and other violations by Turkish forces and their allies\".\n\nIt accuses them of carrying out summary executions and attacking civilians indiscriminately.\n\nHevrin Khalaf, a Kurdish female politician killed on 12 October, was dragged out of her car, beaten and shot dead by Turkish-backed Syrian fighters, Amnesty says.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption A portrait of Hevrin Khalaf (L) appeared along with one of a dead Kurdish fighter, Sehid Rojinda Qendil, at a protest rally in Beirut\n\nIn other attacks, children were killed by Turkish air strikes or mortars, the human rights group says.\n\n\"Turkish military forces and their allies have displayed an utterly callous disregard for civilian lives, launching unlawful deadly attacks in residential areas that have killed and injured civilians,\" said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty's secretary general.\n\nA spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights warned earlier that summary executions were \"serious violations\" of international humanitarian law and could \"amount to a war crime\".\n\nTurkish-backed fighters have denied responsibility for Khalaf's death. President Erdogan insists his operation is aimed at bringing peace to the region and should be welcomed internationally.\n\nAt least 20 people have been killed in Turkey by bombardment from Syria, including eight people in a single mortar attack by Kurdish militants, Turkish officials say, quoted by Reuters news agency.", "description": "The US leader defends his handling of Turkey's offensive as evidence of possible war crimes grows.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rcnvm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
