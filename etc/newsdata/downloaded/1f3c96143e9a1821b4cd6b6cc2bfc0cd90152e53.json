(Photo by Timothy Nwachukwu/NCAA Photos via Getty Images)\n\nKatelyn Ohashi soared to internet fame this year after her UCLA gymnastics routine went viral. The perfect-10 performance set to pop music and featuring an exuberant Ohashi has been viewed nearly 44 million times on Twitter.\n\nA former Team USA member, she brought a positive light back to the sport and made media appearances from coast to coast. But the 2019 UCLA graduate didn\u2019t make a dime off of any of that. UCLA and mainly the NCAA, though did. When NCAA president Mark Emmert called to congratulate her, she shot back with \u201cYou should be thanking me.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nA \ud83d\udd1f isn't enough for this floor routine by @katelyn_ohashi. \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/pqUzl7AlUA \u2014 UCLA Gymnastics (@uclagymnastics) January 13, 2019\n\nIn a video op-ed for the New York Times titled \u201cEveryone Made Money Off My NCAA Career, Except Me\u201d, Ohashi said she was \u201chandcuffed\u201d by the NCAA and slammed the organization for its rules.\n\n\"Along with this came a lot of attention and opportunities, but I couldn't capitalize on them. I was handcuffed by the NCAA rules that prevented me from deriving any benefit from my own name and likeness, regardless of the fact that after my final meet, I had no pro league to join. \"The NCAA is a billion-dollar industry built on the backs of college athletes. How different would things be for me had I been able to use my image and name my last year of school in order to promote the things I want to further my future? I want to make sure the next person doesn't have to wonder.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Fair Pay to Play Act in California would change that for athletes down the line and Ohashi was in \u201cThe Shop\u201d room with LeBron James when governor Gavin Newsom signed it into law last month. The law allows student-athletes to profit off their own name and likeness. It has drawn support as well as criticism from not only fans, but coaches and leaders in NCAA circles.\n\nOhashi clarified some of the misnomers in her piece for the New York Times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about paying salaries to college athletes, it\u2019s about empowering student athletes to rightfully earn off their individual name and likeness without sacrificing their opportunity to get an education. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure if a student-athlete\u2019s jersey is still selling in the bookstore 10 years after graduation, they get a cut. \u201cIt\u2019s about recognizing that women only receive 4 percent of coverage in sports media and giving us the freedom to leverage sponsor deals to break through. \u201cIt\u2019s about treating student athletes with the same respect as any other students who can freely profit off their talent as writers, artists, DJs, programmers or scientists while in college.\u201d\n\nOhashi has one of the strongest perspectives to stand on when arguing for the bill. She shot to fame because of a viral video, one in which she performed a talented act and earned her institution as well as the NCAA money. She performs a sport that doesn\u2019t get much broadcast time and generally keeps athletes for all four years of college, a big get for the NCAA. There is no professional league to move into, though she did perform one last time at the Aurora Games this summer.\n\nShe is a woman, which means she automatically receives less attention than her male counterparts. More people watched UCLA gymnastics, and the sport as a entirety, because of her. She became arguably as popular as Simone Biles.\n\nAnd she is a fan of poetry, having started writing for herself and launching a website for her and a teammate to share their work. If she weren\u2019t an athlete, rather some random student in the senior class, she could have set up a way to monetize it. She could also have released a book while her fame was highest \u2014 a book she put her own work, effort and talent into without the help of the NCAA \u2014 but the NCAA didn\u2019t allow it. She still plans to eventually release books, including children\u2019s books.\n\nThe Pac-12 argued that the bill will ultimately hurt women athletes, which as Yahoo Sports\u2019 Liz Roscher detailed couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Ohashi\u2019s story is exhibit A of that.\n\n\u201cFrom experience, allowing an athlete \u2014 especially women or Olympic-sport athletes, who, for the most part, are staying and graduating from NCAA institutions \u2014 to take advantage of unexpected moments like I had empowers us to help finally earn what we deserve.\"\n\nThe NCAA is unhappy with the law and is expected to challenge it before its set to go into effect in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The star clarified the bill and what it could do for student-athletes.", "authors": ["Cassandra Negley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7Sp3llDRMLRtNMUk8CBDxg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WJH8giDWjZFGjp1IsK8t3w--~B/aD0xOTk1O3c9Mjk5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c5398100-eaae-11e9-bf3d-8167ab7e867c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
