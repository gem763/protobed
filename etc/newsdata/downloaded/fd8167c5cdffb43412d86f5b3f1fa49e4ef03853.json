However, it\u2019s dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very taxing on the body. You\u2019re getting hit in the head constantly.\n\n\"Boxing is a sport that goes hand-to-hand with brain damage. I don\u2019t know if you can tell, but I think I\u2019m already suffering from it.\"\n\nThe dangers of boxing have been highlighted by a number of in-ring deaths this year, including the tragic passing of American Patrick Day, 27, last week as a result of injuries sustained in a bout in Chicago days earlier.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAfter The Bell: Watch Mirror Fighting's new boxing show Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.

That\u2019s just not facts and I\u2019m a man of facts.\n\n(Image: X90206)\n\n\u201cThis year, the conditioning\u2019s improving and the relaxation is improving. That\u2019s why I got tired last year, the adrenaline was rushing.\n\n\"I have been practising with heavier gloves so when I put the smaller ones on, I will be like lightning.\n\n\"I am sparring professional fighters and I am beating them badly. That does so much for my confidence.\n\n\"I relied on my athleticism to carry me through the first fight and it almost worked. But now I am a boxer, I am literally a professional fighter and I feel like it.\n\n\"I love the idea of beating up the person who is trying to beat me up.\"", "description": "Logan Paul is in the middle of a gruelling training regime before his KSI rematch and says it is taking its toll", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20069262.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KSI-VS-Logan-Paul-2-Launch-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
