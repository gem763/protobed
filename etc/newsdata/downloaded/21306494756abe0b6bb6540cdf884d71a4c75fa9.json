The nine had led a 2017 push for independence that triggered Spain's deepest political crisis in decades.\n\nDemonstrations on Friday were mostly peaceful, but police in anti-riot gear clashed in the afternoon with young protesters hurling bottles, eggs and paint at the gates of the police headquarters in central Barcelona. That followed a calm student protest earlier in the day.\n\nParamedics attend a protestor during clashes with police in Barcelona, Spain, early Friday, Oct. 18, 2019.

Catalan authorities said that electricity consumption, a key indicator of industrial activity, was by noon 10.1% lower than at the same time the previous day.\n\nTourists also felt the turmoil. At least two large cruise operators diverted their ships to other ports, and those which had already docked in the port of Barcelona cancelled the passengers' excursions to the city. Architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed's modernist Sagrada Familia also closed its doors due to a protest blocking access to the basilica.
