The spacecraft is loaded with 4 tons of supplies and equipment bound for the International Space Station, including a set of replacement batteries for the lab's solar power system. MHI/JAXA/NASA\n\nStreaking away to the southeast, the booster quickly accelerated as it plowed up and out of the thick lower atmosphere, releasing the spent strap ons and core stage as it went. Fifteen minutes after liftoff, the HTV-8 spacecraft was released to fly on its own.\n\nRocket builder Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency \u2014 JAXA \u2014 attempted to launch the rocket September 10, but a fire broke out on the launch pad during fueling when leaking oxygen and static electricity combined to trigger a blaze.\n\nThe H2-B rocket was not damaged in the incident, the launch pad was repaired and mission managers cleared the booster for launch Tuesday. There were no apparent problems.\n\nIt was the eighth launch of an HTV \"Kounotori\" cargo ship supplied by JAXA and the first since September 2018. The primary payload is a set of lithium-ion batteries needed to replace aging units used to store power from the space station's left-most set of solar arrays during orbital darkness.\n\nAlso on board: crew supplies and equipment that will be needed for another series of spacewalks later this year to repair a particle physics instrument mounted on the station's power truss.\n\nIf all goes well, the HTV-8 cargo ship will catch up with the station early Saturday, pulling up to within about 30 feet and then standing by while the lab's robot arm locks onto a grapple fixture. From there, it will be pulled in for berthing at the Earth facing port of the forward Harmony module..\n\nThe HTV-8 cargo ship will reach the station early Saturday when it will be captured by the lab's robot arm and pulled in for docking at the Earth-facing port of the forward Harmony module. The Soyuz MS-15/61S crew ferry ship, scheduled for launch from Kazakhstan Wednesday, will dock at the aft port of the Russian Zvezda module. A Progress cargo ship and two other Soyuz vehicles are already docked at the station. NASA\n\nInside the HTV's pressurized cabin is more than 5,300 pounds of science equipment, spare parts, spacewalk equipment, computer gear and crew supplies. The batteries are mounted on a pallet in the cargo ship's unpressurized trunk section.\n\nThe power packs will be pulled out by the robot arm later. They will be installed during five spacewalks on the far left side of the lab's solar power truss. The spacewalks, or EVAs, are tentatively planned for Oct. 6, 11, 16, 21 and 25.\n\nThe station's solar array truss features eight huge solar wings, four on each end arranged in pairs. The arrays rotate like slow-motion paddle wheels as the station flies through its orbit to maximize the amount of sunlight reaching the solar cells.\n\nWhen the station is in sunlight, power is fed directly to the lab's myriad systems. At the same time they re-charge four sets of massive batteries housed at the base of each array. When the station moves into orbital darkness, the batteries seamlessly kick in to keep the station powered.\n\nThe station's eight electrical power channels originally were supported by 48 nickel-hydrogen \u2014 NiH2 \u2014 batteries, six per channel. Twenty-four batteries, in two sets of 12, were mounted at the bases of the solar array wings on the starboard, or right, side of the station's main truss with two sets of 12 on the port, or left, side.\n\nNASA is in the process of replacing all 48 of the old nickel-hydrogen batteries with 24 smaller, more efficient lithium-ion \u2014 Li-Ion \u2014 batteries carried up to the station aboard Japanese HTV cargo ships. The six batteries aboard the HTV-8 spacecraft are the third set of six to be delivered. Another six will be delivered next year.", "description": "Spacecraft is carrying fresh batteries to replace aging units in the space station's solar power system", "authors": ["William Harwood", "Bill Harwood Has Been Covering The U.S. Space Program Full-Time Since", "First As Cape Canaveral Bureau Chief For United Press International", "Now As A Consultant For Cbs News.
