The NBA is global and the Raptors have a global audience.\u201d\n\nIrving J Rein, a professor of communications studies at Northwestern University, said that some people would find the branded hijabs empowering and others would find them offensive, but that it was hard to say how many people might stop watching the Raptors because of them.\n\n\u201cAthletes are really speaking out about controversial topics in ways that they\u2019ve not spoken out before,\u201d he said, citing Kaepernick and LeBron James.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a space that we don\u2019t understand very well and the ability to predict is very difficult.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The Toronto Raptors have introduced a new line of team-branded hijabs in an effort to be more inclusive to fans of all cultures.
