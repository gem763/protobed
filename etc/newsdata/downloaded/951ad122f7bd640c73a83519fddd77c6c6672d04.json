Every few weeks since then, the press has documented someone else\u2014a TV personality, a retired general, a senator or two\u2014who has the president\u2019s ear on foreign policy, and wondered about why Trump has kept Bolton around at all. Then, last week, the Washington Post reported that Bolton had been cut out of a briefing on the U.S. plan to end the war in Afghanistan by way of a peace deal he has opposed.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs a cruel summer turns to autumn, Bolton can take heart that many of his predecessors have spent time in the president\u2018s harsh glare. Some might be surprised to learn that even Henry Kissinger, who made the title \u201cnational security adviser\u201d a household name, was in the doghouse with Richard Nixon 50 years ago.\n\nKissinger, like Bolton, sought to shake up the national security bureaucracy by doing away with formal processes and developing a close partnership with the president. But when Nixon grew annoyed with Kissinger, the national security adviser struggled to re-find his footing. Unfortunately, as I discovered researching a new history on the National Security Council, the obsequious path Kissinger took on his way to getting back in Nixon\u2019s good graces\u2014indulging the president\u2019s penchant for surveillance and desire to escalate the war in Vietnam\u2014helped lead the United States down a dark and divisive path.\n\nBolton, who has both a longer government r\u00e9sum\u00e9 than Kissinger and bigger policy differences with his president, now must decide what, if anything, he can do to earn Trump\u2019s approval again. As he considers his options\u2014and, perhaps more importantly, the fate of the country\u2014Kissinger\u2019s return from the cold is a cautionary tale.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn 1968, Kissinger, a Harvard professor, did not have much government experience. That did not mean he lacked strong opinions about how government should work, however. In a seminar at the University of California, Los Angeles, that spring, Kissinger suggested that a president must, in his first four months, \u201cgive enough of a shake to the bureaucracy to indicate that he wants a new direction, and he must be brutal enough to demonstrate that he means it.\u201d\n\nDespite his inexperience and cold-blooded view of policymaking, Kissinger had his eyes on the White House. He had served as the principal foreign policy adviser to New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller\u2019s Republican primary campaign. When Nixon won the nomination and then the general election, Kissinger (and just about everyone else) was surprised when the president-elect requested a meeting, and promptly offered him the job of national security adviser.\n\nNixon and Kissinger found that they shared a realist worldview about both protecting America\u2019s interests and managing the government. According to Kissinger\u2019s memoirs, Nixon made clear in their first meetings that he wanted to \u201crun foreign policy from the White House,\u201d an approach Kissinger supported. Nixon worried more about opposition from liberals in the bureaucracy, especially the \u201cimpossible fags\u201d at the State Department, as he called them, while Kissinger worried about supposedly lesser thinkers messing with coherent strategy.\n\nNixon charged Kissinger with establishing a \u201cvery exciting new procedure\u201d for managing the bureaucracy. During the transition period, Kissinger devised a plan\u2014what became known as the \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat at the Hotel Pierre,\u201d where the Nixon transition offices were in New York\u2014that called on the national security adviser to replace the secretary of state as chair of key foreign policy meetings. After a few months in office, Nixon and Kissinger started ignoring the formal gatherings altogether, and began working closely with just a handful of aides.\n\nThe duo\u2019s primary focus in the administration\u2019s first year was Vietnam. At one session that spring, Nixon told some members of the National Security Council staff that they could \u201chandle the rest of the world,\u201d according to one staffer\u2019s recollection. The president then turned to Kissinger and said, \u201cAnd you and I will end the war.\u201d\n\nNixon was clear, as he said in a call with Kissinger, that the way to end a war that had dragged on for years was to \u201cgo hard.\u201d Without involving the secretaries of state and defense (or with them only reluctantly), Nixon and Kissinger tried to do just that. They arranged covert bombings in Cambodia, coordinated back-channel talks with the Soviet Union, and cooked up a secret ultimatum to present to North Vietnam and the military plans to make good on it.\n\nBut it was not an easy partnership. Despite sharing a worldview, distrust of the bureaucracy and certain paranoias, Kissinger was not a natural Nixon man. The president and his inner circle, including White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman, were staunchly conservative. According to recollections from aides and reporting, Kissinger, who was suspected of being more open-minded in his habits, ideas and friendships, worried about appearing too liberal or \u201csoft.\u201d\n\nKissinger\u2019s government inexperience was also a problem. As one member of his staff indelicately put it, the national security adviser\u2019s office was \u201clike a Moroccan whorehouse, with people queuing up outside his door for hours.\u201d That was partly by design: Kissinger wanted everything to run through him. But he was also \u201cless at home as an administrator,\u201d as one aide later admitted.\n\nAs Vietnam dragged on without resolution in 1969, Nixon was demonstrating a \u201cgrowing intolerance\u201d for Kissinger\u2019s \u201cattitudes and habits,\u201d according to Haldeman\u2019s contemporaneous notes. The national security adviser was \u201cgetting heat for his staff inefficiency.\u201d The president and his team also did not like Kissinger\u2019s relationships with perceived liberals on his staff or enemies in the press. And when foreign policy initiatives\u2014like the secret channels to Moscow or the ultimatum to North Vietnam\u2014did not pan out as planned, Kissinger tended to blame others, demand more authority or threaten to quit.\n\nIn the face of what Nixon considered the national security adviser\u2019s tendency to overreact, he created a \u201cHenry-Handling Committee,\u201d which included Haldeman and a few others. Their task, according to Kissinger biographer Walter Isaacson, was to keep the national security adviser from blowing his top, or at least to keep the eruption away from Nixon. It was a novel bureaucratic technique, but such redirection tended to just make Kissinger, who was already insecure about access to the president, overreact even more.\n\nOn October 27, as Haldeman later wrote, the \u201cproblem came to a head.\u201d In a meeting with the president, Kissinger started complaining again about Secretary of State William Rogers, who he feared was interfering and jeopardizing ongoing diplomacy with the Soviet Union. Nixon promptly shut the meeting down, and the president told Haldeman that Kissinger\u2019s obsession was \u201cimpairing his usefulness.\u201d Although Haldeman and others in the White House sympathized with Kissinger\u2019s concerns and valued him, they wondered whether he could continue with such outbursts.\n\nGetting back in the president\u2019s good graces was not easy, in part because Kissinger had shaken the government so hard. With little formal process and everything running through the national security adviser, Kissinger needed Nixon for power. In the coming months, Kissinger distanced himself from some staffers and agreed to wiretap others, according to Isaacson and journalist Seymour Hersh. Kissinger also empowered some aides who helped make him a more efficient bureaucratic competitor. And he worked to give Nixon the options to hit Vietnam hard, including the escalations that would come in the years ahead.\n\nBy the end of 1969, Kissinger was on better terms with Nixon and a more powerful place in Washington, but he had scars to show for his first full year in government. At a dinner with some colleagues and their wives, the national security adviser, according to Isaacson, reflected on the Nixon experience. \u201cIt would have been very different with Rockefeller,\u201d he said wistfully. \u201cSo much more normal.\u201d\n\nOf course, the years ahead be anything but normal. Kissinger grew in prestige, becoming the first and only national security adviser to serve simultaneously as secretary of state. Through it all, he abided and occasionally abetted as Nixon took his presidency over the edge; the wiretaps became Watergate, and the escalations in Vietnam proved incredibly destructive, both in Southeast Asia and in the United States.\n\n\n\n***\n\nSince Kissinger, plenty of national security advisers have been on the outs with the president. Ronald Reagan grew so frustrated with William \u201cThe Judge\u201d Clark that he made him secretary of the Interior. James Jones was never a great fit for President Barack Obama. And neither of Trump\u2019s first two advisers\u2014Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster\u2014hung on long.\n\nIn some ways, Bolton tried to avoid his predecessor\u2019s fates with bureaucratic expertise. Compared with his predecessors in the Trump White House and even with Kissinger in 1969, Bolton is a seasoned Washington player, one who considers himself a \u201cgood bureaucrat,\u201d who knows the traps and how to lay them. Even if Bolton never shared all of Trump\u2019s policy preferences, he was well positioned to give the government a shake.\n\nWithin a year of becoming national security adviser, Bolton got rid of much of the regular order of meetings and memoranda that had become the Washington norm in the 50 years since Kissinger put the national security adviser at the center of the government. Bolton has preferred informal sessions, consulted with fewer players and, for a time, took advantage of his proximity to the president\u2019s office. Bolton\u2019s approach appeared to work well enough at first.\n\nYet after he repeatedly pushed a harder line this spring on North Korea, Iran and other issues, Trump made clear that the national security adviser did not always speak for him . In late June, Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson accompanied the president to the Korean Demilitarized Zone; Bolton traveled separately to Mongolia. By now, the break between Trump and Bolton has gone on so long\u2014longer than Nixon and Kissinger\u2019s\u2014and so publicly, that the reports about the Afghanistan meeting were shocking but not surprising.\n\nAs good a bureaucrat as Bolton claims to be, he seems to have been hurt by breaking the process. He had few outlets or allies to turn to when Trump stopped listening to him. After Bolton made the NSC far less inclusive, someone got away with doing the same to him on Afghanistan. The savvy insider has learned one of the town\u2019s oldest lessons, a lesson Kissinger learned the hard way, too: Once you break a process, it won\u2019t be there to save you.\n\nNow that Bolton has been sidelined, the question is not only what he can do to regain power, but also whether he has the stomach for it. The lesson in Kissinger\u2019s comeback is that power comes with a cost. For now, Bolton appears to be staying true to his own beliefs, a path that might be more comfortable but is certainly not sustainable.", "description": "Richard Nixon, like Donald Trump, soured on his national security adviser.
