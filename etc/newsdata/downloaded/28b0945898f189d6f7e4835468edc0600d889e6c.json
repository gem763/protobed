But some teens on social media are responding to the news in a unique way by using the viral hashtag #StopJuuling on TikTok.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, the hashtag on the popular video app has over 10 million views on original content created by its users. However, the videos don\u2019t necessarily include the helpful warnings that one might expect. Instead, many of them are mocking recent reports about the epidemic and even faking their own vape-related illnesses.\n\nOne video in particular has received over 5.5 million views according to the user who posted it, Crislynn Keener. The 17-year-old tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she made the video where she pretended to be in the hospital with a collapsed lung as a result of Juuling for humor and to catch people\u2019s attention.\n\nA TikTok user named Crislynn received over 5 million views on her #StopJuuling video. More\n\n\u201cMany people are posting videos towards humor, such as making fun of people who Juul getting sick, jokes about how \u2018all the teens died from Juuling in 2019,\u2019 and shots of injuries warning to \u2018not Juul\u2019 when the injuries have no correlation to Juuling,\u201d Keener wrote via email. (There have been six confirmed deaths and more than 450 cases of possible severe lung injury from vaping, but it\u2019s not yet clear which products were used.)\n\n\u201cWith my video, I was thinking of topics that have recently been very popular and sometimes controversial to catch people\u2019s attention,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has also been a joke amongst me and my friends that I would be the one out of our friend group to get a vape related illness because I had been vaping much longer than they had.\u201d\n\nKeener happened to be in the hospital when she decided to take advantage of her surroundings for content. That\u2019s when she created the video faking a vaping-related illness.\n\n\u201cWanna know what happens when you juul for 4 years?\u201d the video reads. \u201cHospitalized and under surveillance for a collapsed lung!!\u201d\n\nThe teen showed off an IV in her arm before having the camera scan across the room where she lay in a hospital bed.\n\n\u201cStop vaping before it\u2019s too late,\u201d the video concludes.\n\nMillions of views later, it\u2019s clearly made an impact.\n\n\u201cReactions to my video have been full of mixed emotions,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people comment saying that they feel sorry for me or that they are now stopping; others make fun of me or say that I deserve [the illness] and that they hope I don\u2019t make it. I never intended for my video to necessarily go viral, as I only had 12 followers who were all my friends. Now, I currently have 20.6K followers, with 5.5M views on that single video, and a total of 704.2K likes.\u201d\n\nOther videos that have accumulated hundreds of thousands of likes under the #StopJuuling hashtag take a different approach to this Juul-related \u201chumor\u201d by attributing random injuries to vaping or even making jokes about future history lessons where 2019 is said to be the year \u201call teenagers died.\u201d\n\nStill, Keener says that, although her video was a joke \u2014 which she clarified in a follow-up post \u2014 she still takes the vaping epidemic seriously.\n\n\u201cEver since I\u2019ve seen and read about the stories of the hundreds of kids being affected by Juuling out of nowhere, I\u2019ve been fear stricken because I myself Juuled for roughly 3 years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf it was up to me, i would get the FDA to pull it from every store across the nation. These teens are full of potential, yet they throw it all away.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Administration has actually started talks with the FDA about removing flavored e-cigarettes from the market.", "description": "#StopJuuling is trending on TikTok as teens create parody videos about vaping-related illnesses and deaths.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rNPDDH89_Tv61yn8nwKt_A--~B/aD05NzQ7dz05MjI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c9e340d0-d5a3-11e9-9ffe-7b81a31bfd06", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
