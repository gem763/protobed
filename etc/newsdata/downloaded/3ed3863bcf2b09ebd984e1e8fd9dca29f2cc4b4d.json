So no, don\u2019t #SavePiers, #F**kPiers.\u2019\n\nPiers, 54, reshared the post and commented: \u2018Amusing that \u2066@davidwalliams\u2069 regularly \u2018likes\u2019 the nastiest tweets about me, yet is such a snivelling toady to my face.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not my fault \u2066@BGT\u2069 ratings were so much higher when I was in your chair Dave!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid, 48, has not yet responded to Piers\u2019 comments.\n\nIt comes after a petition was launched for Piers to be sacked from GMB after his comments about gender.\n\nSo far, more than 20,000 people have signed a Change.org petition calling for Piers to be removed from hosting the ITV breakfast show.\n\n\u2018Morgan dictates to his viewers that it\u2019s acceptable to deny an LGBTQ+ person of their rights; it\u2019s acceptable to tell them they don\u2019t exist; it\u2019s acceptable to call them \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they get rightfully upset,\u2019 the petition states.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018These are the lessons Morgan teaches. ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\n\n\u2018I understand that viewers are important, numbers mean business and high engagement suggests success, but are there really no other ways to achieve it?\n\n\u2018Despite Good Morning Britain\u2019s current performance, to be conscious of a majority of their viewership being sexist, racist, transphobic, and generally unwilling to accept minorities or viewpoints aside from their own is repulsive, for lack of a better term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Wake up to the reality of Morgan\u2019s behaviour. Hate crimes are on the rise, transphobia and discrimination over gender identity is becoming commonplace both upon social media and in the real world, and ITV continue to sit idly and let it play out in the name of entertainment. \u2018It should be obvious by now that this has far surpassed an acceptable threshold, with Morgan\u2019s rhetoric and actions sitting firmly in dangerous territory.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk reached out to David\u2019s reps but received no comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
