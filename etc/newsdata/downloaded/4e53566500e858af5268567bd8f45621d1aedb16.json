The girls were charged as juveniles.\n\n\u201cThe loss of civility in this world is being played out in the realm of 10- and 11-year-olds,\u201d Lauren French, the local school superintendent, said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThere is no shade of gray in this. This event was wrong on all levels.\u201d\n\nThe girl who was assaulted had her right eye blackened from being punched, lost hair when it was pulled and bruised her knee after falling backward onto a school bus seat during the attack, the police said.\n\nA bus aide who was riding with the children at the time and did not intervene was charged with three counts of endangering the welfare of a child, the police said.\n\n\u201cThat this was allegedly perpetrated by her own classmates, on a school bus with an adult monitor present, makes this incident even more shocking and troubling,\u201d Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nCuomo, who noted in his statement that the episode had lasted 20 minutes, said that he was directing the state Division of Human Rights to open an investigation. He also said he had asked the Hate Crimes Task Force to assist the local authorities.\n\nThe arrests coincide with a national push to treat acts of bullying among juveniles as crimes, sometimes at the request of victims\u2019 parents. It also coincides with a rise in hate-crime incidents in schools across the United States; 753 such cases were reported in 2017, according to FBI data.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are saying that by calling it bullying, we are not taking it as seriously as we could, and not treating it as damaging and harmful as it really is,\u201d said Amanda Nickerson, director of the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention at the University at Buffalo. \u201cSome are arguing we have to elevate this to other levels.\u201d\n\nSome municipalities have enacted local laws that can lead to parents being fined for their children\u2019s actions. In North Tonawanda, New York, near Buffalo, parents may be fined $250 and jailed up to 15 days if their children engage in bullying behavior. Gouverneur does not have such a law.\n\nFrench, the schools superintendent, said that she agreed with the police\u2019s decision to treat the episode as a crime, as did Mayor Ronald P. McDougall of Gouverneur.\n\nBut some anti-bullying advocates said they believe the drive to turn young children into criminals over such behavior has gone too far.\n\n\u201cParents are out for blood,\u201d said Ross Ellis, the founder and chief executive of Stomp Out Bullying.org, a national organization. \u201cI had a mother call me who wanted a 3-year-old on the playground arrested. I get that you don\u2019t want your child beaten up, but it\u2019s got to stop on both ends.\u201d\n\nEllis said that the girls accused of bullying should receive counseling and that school officials and the girls\u2019 parents should meet to explore the roots of the behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing that happened, but make it a teachable moment,\u201d she said.\n\nGouverneur, which has 4,000 residents and is about 30 miles from the Canadian border, is 95% white and 1% black, according to 2010 census data.\n\nThe police said that their inquiry began on Sept. 10, when the alleged victim\u2019s mother filed a complaint saying that her daughter had been subjected to \u201cracially motivated language\u201d and beaten up on the bus.\n\nThe police arrested the two girls on Monday after a two-week investigation, charging them with second-degree harassment. The 11-year-old was also charged with third-degree assault as a hate crime, the police said.\n\nThe bus aide, Tiffany N. Spicer of Edwards, New York, who is also white, was employed by the First Student bus company. She was released on appearance tickets and ordered to appear in court at a later date, the police said. She could not be reached for comment.", "description": "Two girls, 10 and 11, face criminal charges of harassment and assault of a 10-year-old girl on a school bus in a small upstate New York town, in an episode that the local police are treating as a racial hate crime.The two girls charged in the alleged attack, which occurred on Sept. 10, are white, and", "authors": ["Sharon Otterman", "Azi Paybarah"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WjvZyOJD3AnahX4FZiDhJg--~B/aD0yMzEyO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/eca61cb0-df39-11e9-9efb-7500edd4bf1c", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
