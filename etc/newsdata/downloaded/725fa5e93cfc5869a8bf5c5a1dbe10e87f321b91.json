A bride asked just one of her two nieces to be the flower girl at her wedding \u2014 and then fired her and gave the job to the other little girl on the big day (stock photo)\n\nThe bride said that her wedding last weekend was 'lovely' but there was some 'commotion' that's proving a problem.\n\n'For flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision,' she said.\n\n'Unfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her.\n\n'Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did.'\n\nBut though 'cute' Amber got the gig, she wasn't being a good sport about it.\n\n'During the wedding prep, Katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself,' she said.\n\nShe did pay attention once her actual wedding day rolled around, and she saw the bullying firsthand \u2014 and found it 'pretty cruel.'\n\nDrama: The bride said she picked the first niece because she's 'cuter,' but when she saw her bullying the second niece, she took away the privilege\n\n'Amber ... told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly,' the bride said.\n\n'I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie.\n\n'Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother.\n\nWhile she seems to think she made the right call, she said her other brother, Amber the bully's dad, is 'extremely angry' at her.\n\nFor my perfect day I felt shallow, and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance, I picked her\n\n'He said Amber has been crying the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to the job,' she said.\n\n'As someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right thing to do after Amber's behaviour towards Katie. I can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point Katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than Amber,' she concluded.\n\nBut Redditors weren't buying her explanation.\n\nIn fact, they judged her to be in the wrong for several reasons, pointing out that it was cruel to play favorites based on who was 'cuter,' irresponsible to make one feel superior to the other, and, most of all, just plain dumb to narrow it down to a single flower girl in the first place.\n\n'[You're the a***hole] for not just having two flower girls. Like, why was this even an issue in the first place?' one person asked.\n\n'It would have been so easy to have 2 flower girls and avoid this whole situation,' said another.\n\n'What on earth made you just pick *one* flower girl when there were two little girls?' asked another. 'And picking the \"prettier\" one? Hearing she was bullying the other one and doing nothing? Then punishing her on the day of.... ??? You owe everyone there an apology.'\n\nSeveral more were disgusted that the bride chose the 'cuter' niece.\n\n'These are eight-year-old CHILDREN,' wrote one. 'If she is falling into the trap of judging her very young relatives based on their looks, that is absolutely horrifying.'\n\n'Who the hell are you to be judging an 8 year old kid on how cute she is? Sounds like bullying runs in the family,' said one more.\n\nSeveral even said it was the bride's own fault that Amber bullied Katie, because she set the example.\n\n'[You made it] so incredibly obvious that you were picking Amber over Katie in the first place that you gave credibility to Amber's bullying,' said one.\n\n'There was no reason you couldn't have 2 flower girls. You played favorites, then realized it was problematic when Amber exaggerated the same reasoning that lead to your initial decision.'\n\n'You're surprised to hear Amber call Katie ugly when you basically did the same damn thing in your rationale for excluding Katie from your wedding in the first place,' added another.\n\nThe bride didn't respond to most of the comments, but did say that it didn't even occur to her to have multiple flower girls.", "description": "A bride asked just one of her two nieces to be the flower girl at her wedding - and then fired her and gave the job to the other little girl on the big day.", "authors": ["Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19307522-0-image-a-94_1570208298796.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
