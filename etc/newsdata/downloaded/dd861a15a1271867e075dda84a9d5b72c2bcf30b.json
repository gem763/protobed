Health officials have warned the drops are 'unacceptable' and 'concerning'\n\nShe said it was 'important that children are vaccinated', adding: 'I remember looking after two children as they died from measles.'\n\nMr Hancock pledged 'bold action' after a report last month showed vaccination rates for all nine childhood jabs dropped in England last year.\n\nRates for the six-in-one jab, which protects against illness such as polio and tetanus, dropped to 92.1 among one-year-olds \u2013 the lowest figure in at least 10 years.\n\nCoverage of the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, fell for the fifth year in a row, the NHS figures revealed.\n\nExperts blamed the drop on online claims that jabs don\u2019t work or are harmful, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson once dubbed \u2018superstitious mumbo jumbo\u2019.\n\nOther parents may miss giving their children the jabs because illnesses such as polio have been eradicated in the UK, meaning they have forgotten how serious they are.\n\nEarlier this week, researchers said vaccines should be offered in supermarkets, pop-up clinics and at music festivals to help boost immunisation rates.\n\nThey argued that, before steps are taken to introduce such an 'extreme policy' as mandatory vaccination, clinics should open at weekends and in the evenings to improve access to the jabs.\n\nAlmost all of the 20 areas with the lowest levels of MMR coverage at the age of five were in London, figures have revealed. Only Surrey, which ranked 20th lowest with 79 per cent, was outside of the capital city\n\nWHAT WILL THE GOVERNMENT AND NHS DO TO IMPROVE VACCINATION RATES? The Department of Health and the NHS are expected to produce a comprehensive strategy for improving vaccination rates later this year. Health authorities said they will: Write to GPs to urge them to promote a catch-up vaccination scheme offering jabs to children and under-25s who missed theirs when they were young. Update information on its websites to address parents' concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, specifically using scientific evidence to address and disprove misleading claims.\n\nInvest more in 'local immunisation coordinators' to promote vaccination in families who are hard to reach and areas with low uptake.\n\nCall a meeting of social media companies, such as Facebook and Twitter, to discuss how to stop false information about vaccines spreading online.\n\nThey said most parents do vaccinate their children but those who do not often have problems attending clinics or simply forget.\n\nA busy family life and needing to take time off work to get children vaccinated are all barriers to people making sure youngsters are up to date, they added.\n\nThe experts played down the role of anti-vaccination groups on social media, saying trust in social media is generally low in the UK, while confidence in doctors and nurses is high.\n\nHelen Bedford, professor of children's health at University College London's Institute of Child Health, said there is an urgent need to look at all the barriers that prevent vaccination.\n\n'What we know is that most people that are under-immunised, it's about difficulty accessing services,' she said.\n\n'To go towards mandation when we don't have all these other things is just a knee-jerk reaction.'\n\nDavid Elliman, consultant community paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, said he was in favour of clinics being set up in places such as music festivals.\n\nAnd he said mandatory vaccination should not be introduced to 'prop up failures in the system'.\n\nAs well as the ethical issues of forcing people to vaccinate, 'there really is no convincing evidence from anywhere that it works', he said, adding: 'We could make things worse.'", "description": "Dame Sally Davies' comments come after an NHS report last month revealed figures vaccination rates for all nine childhood jabs dropped in England last year.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/wire-19532868-1570701517-898_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
