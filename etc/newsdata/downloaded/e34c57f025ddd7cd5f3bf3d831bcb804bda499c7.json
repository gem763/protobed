Erdogan launched the Turkish offensive in Syria, called Operation Peace Spring, last week to clear out what Ankara considers to be Kurdish terrorists in the country\u2019s northeastern sector.\n\nTurkey\u2019s aim is to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in the northeast, near the border, to allow Syrian refugees in Turkey to resettle in their native country.\n\n\u201cWe are about to implement our decision on Manbij,\u201d Erdogan said earlier.\n\n\u201cWhen Manbij is evacuated, the real owners will enter there.\u201d\n\nErdogan called on NATO allies for support, saying Turkey is under \u201cpressure\u201d and \u201charassment\u201d by Kurdish terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe are a NATO ally. \u2026 They need to stand by us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Turkish leader said more than 500 Kurdish \u201cterrorists\u201d have been killed since the operation began last week.\n\nSyrian state-run media reported Monday that President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces were traveling north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression.\u201d\n\nThe fighting began last week after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, allowing Erdogan\u2019s military to begin the offensive and drawing substantial criticism from the international community and members of both major U.S. political parties.\n\nAs a response to the fighting, nations in the European Union agreed Monday to halt exporting weapons to Turkey, saying they undermine stability and security in the region and hinders the Syrian peace process. EU foreign ministers reached the agreement at a meeting in Luxembourg, and also said they will draft a sanctions list related to Turkish drilling off Cyprus.\n\nEU diplomats said the move is effectively an identical, quicker version of a full formal EU arms embargo.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s security concerns in North-East Syria should be addressed through political and diplomatic means, not with military action, and in accordance with international humanitarian law,\u201d the EU Council said.\n\nFrance, Germany, Finland and Sweden had already barred arms sales to Turkey.\n\nThe leaders of several European countries blamed Washington for the deteriorating situation Monday.\n\nFrance is working to protect its troops in Syria, who have been there to support U.S. forces in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. Belgium and other nations are concerned captured European Union natives who joined the group could be set free or break out, and would be able to easily infiltrate Europe with terror attacks.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said previously his troops would also leave in the event of a U.S. pullout.\n\nAt least 11 civilians were killed and 74 injured in Ras al-Ain Serekaniye, just south of the Syria-Turkey border, the Kurdish Red Crescent reported, and 200,000 have been displaced. The U.N. World Food Program said it\u2019s planning assistance for 400,000 people who may need food and other aid.\n\nTrump threatened Turkey with \u201cbig\u201d sanctions Monday, suggesting Kurdish forces could be releasing terrorist captives to re-engage the U.S. military.\n\n\u201cWe are not going into another war between people who have been fighting each other for 200 years,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cEurope had a chance to get their [IS] prisoners but didn\u2019t want the cost. \u2018Let the USA pay,\u2019 they said \u2026 Do people really think we should go to war with NATO member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!\u201d\n\nA video circulated online claimed to show Turkish-backed militants executing a Kurdish politician, her driver, members of the Kurdish security forces and several civilians.\n\nDozens of Palestinian demonstrators in the Gaza Strip marched Monday to support the Turkish incursion, following days of similar shows of support.", "description": "Oct. 14 (UPI) \u2014 Syrian forces swept into Kurdish areas in the country\u2019s northeast on Monday amid flashes of fighting in minority-held areas", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
