He celebrated his birthday on Tuesday at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nDuring the war, Brooks was stationed in New Guinea and the Philippines as part of the predominantly African-American 91st Engineer Battalion and worked as a servant to three white officers.\n\nIn the museum's collection of oral histories, Brooks talked about throwing loads of barbed wire into the ocean after one of the engines on his C-47 plane went out, laughing as he recalled his banter with the pilot and co-pilot. He eventually achieved the rank of Private 1st Class.\n\nLawrence Brooks' dog tag from World War II.
