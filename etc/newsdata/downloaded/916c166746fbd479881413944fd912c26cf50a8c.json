She founded it after reading about child abuse at an Eastern European institution in a newspaper.\n\nJK Rowling speaking at the One Young World summit in central London is pictured above with Ade Adepitan who was also in attendance\n\nChildren in orphanages will often have living parents (image above is of orphans in Haiti\n\nLumos is named after the light-giving spell in Rowling's Harry Potter fantasy series.\n\nThe charity's new campaign illuminates how some orphanages exploit children for money from tourists, and the devastating effects of the system.\n\nSpeaking at the summit in central London, Rowling said: 'Do not volunteer in orphanages.\n\n'The reason we don't have orphanages in the developed world is because they cause often irreparable harm.\n\nJK Rowling, with (left to right) Alex Christopoulos, Ruth Wacuka, Alexon Tassy, and Ade Adepitan. She urged people not to volunteer at orphanages\n\n'The system renders children vulnerable to abuse and trafficking, and impacts their life prospects.'\n\nThe 54-year-old said that she wasn't suggesting that orphanages are always set up with bad intentions but that the effect on children is 'universally poor'.\n\nThe world's first billionaire author, who has donated much of her wealth to charity, said: 'One of the facts which most stunned me, is eight out of 10 of those living in so-called orphanages are not orphans.\n\n'Eight out of 10 will have one living parent, at least, and overwhelmingly, the family did not want to give up the child.\n\n'This is where it becomes particularly grim. The number one reason for them ending up in an orphanage is poverty.'\n\nRowling said the West has often funded orphanages and that not all of them are set up with bad intention (stock image of a depressed child sitting on the floor)\n\nShe added that many are disabled and that in most cases they had been sent their by their parents, as the institutions offer education and health-care.\n\nShe said 'voluntourism' - where travellers 'help out' at orphanages as part of a holiday - is funding the abuse of children via the orphanage system.\n\nRowling said: 'The West has often, with the best intentions, funded these orphanages.\n\n'Another key pillar propping up the orphanage business - and I have to call it that - is people volunteering at and visiting orphanages. In other words, voluntourism.\n\n'Overwhelmingly, of course, people believe they are doing good. Often young people come away thinking they did good, and are appalled when the facts are laid in front of them, that they have been perpetuating abuse.\n\n'Some orphanages are set up literally to abuse children - to get money from the pockets of voluntourism.\n\n'If money and energy was given to charities instead, we could solve this problem within decades.'\n\nEight million children are living in institutions around the world, according to Lumos.\n\nAs well as founding Lumos, Rowling has supported charities including Comic Relief, One Parent Families, and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain.\n\nThe Princess Royal opened The Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic with JK Rolwing at at Edinburgh University in 2010\n\nThe Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic is an integrated care and research facility focusing on MS and neurological conditions\n\nThe Harry Potter author, pictured here with her mother and sister, was just 25 when her mother passed away in 1990. She said she was haunted by the death, describing it as 'a literal pain in my heart'\n\nLast month, she donated \u00a315.3 million to support research into the treatment of multiple sclerosis and similar conditions at the University of Edinburgh's Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, which is named after her late mother.\n\nDeputy CEO for Lumos Alex Christopoulos, who grew up at an orphanage in Nairobi because her parents could not afford to raise her, spoke alongside Rowling at the conference.\n\nMs Christopoulos said: 'I am a living testimony because my parents were alive.\n\n'Every child has a story of neglect, abandonment, violence. They have been robbed of the right to love.\n\n'You see visitors grab you and tell you how adorable you are, but then they walk out. It's not easy.'\n\nShe added: 'Children are not tourist attractions, they are not animals.'\n\nOn Monday, the Government also warned against the 'serious and unintended consequences' of orphanage tourism, ahead of Lumos's campaign launch.\n\nThe Foreign Office said visitors may 'unknowingly contribute towards child exploitation' by volunteering at overseas institutions.", "description": "Giving a speech at the One Young World Summit in London JK Rowling said orphanages can cause 'irreparable harm', leaving children vulnerable to abuse and trafficking.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/20/20148712-0-image-a-6_1571944635465.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
