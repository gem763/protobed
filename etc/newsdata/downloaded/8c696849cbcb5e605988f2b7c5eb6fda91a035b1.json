The Rihanna song Work also features \u2013 the lyrics to which hang in Manhattan\u2019s Golden Theatre.\n\nWoke up Broadway: the difficulty of updating stories for the stage Read more\n\nHarris is part of a new wave of diverse theatre-makers and playwrights \u2013 including Jackie Sibblies Drury, who won a Pulitzer prize for Fairview, and Tarell McCraney, who won an Oscar for Moonlight and whose play Choir Boy was recently on Broadway \u2013 who are bringing new work and new voices to New York theatre. They are also changing perceptions of what can be commercially successful in the process.\n\nSlave Play, directed by Robert O\u2019Hara, was performed at New York Theatre Workshop last year, where it attracted rave reviews and sold-out audiences that included stars such as Madonna, Whoopi Goldberg and Scarlett Johansson. It also attracted anger from some in the form of a campaign to shut it down and a petition started by a woman who said it left her \u201coffended and traumatized\u201d.\n\nBut when, months later, it was still being talked about, the show\u2019s producers decided to take it to Broadway.\n\nAt just 30 years old, and only months since graduating, Harris is now the youngest black male playwright ever to have a play on Broadway, a place where he never expected his work to find a home.\n\nIt\u2019s really humbling and exciting that a work like this is going to Broadway, but it\u2019s also raw, Jeremy O Harris\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really humbling and exciting that a work like this is going to Broadway, but it\u2019s also raw,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of different emotions for me because there\u2019s a history on Broadway and I\u2019m not really a part of it, or people like me aren\u2019t really a part of it. You can probably count on your hand, on your right hand, the amount of black queer men or women who have had successful Broadway careers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some energy happening \u2026 I don\u2019t know that I can call it a sea change until it\u2019s not a surprise that a young, black and queer person is on Broadway and having a show that people want to see,\u201d said Harris.\n\nLead producer Greg Nobile said the \u201cgolden age\u201d of television and social media have helped shift audience tastes. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing actively the conversation about what is commercial shifting pretty radically in real time on Broadway,\u201d he said.\n\nTo Sullivan Jones, who plays Phillip in Slave Play, Broadway always felt like an \u201celite space\u201d. \u201cOf course there have been the outliers, but just like a trend of old pieces of theatre that have been composed and worked on by black people, brown people, queer people, and we\u2019re bringing all of that forth with this,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Hara, who directed both the off- and on-Broadway productions, said the play is \u201cincredibly triggering\u201d.\n\nSuch is the thought-provoking nature of the play that they are holding public conversations on Sunday afternoons for audience members to discuss the play.\n\nDuring rehearsals, O\u2019Hara said the cast had \u201ca lot of conversations about the nature of race, the nature of sexuality, the nature of interracial love, the history of America, the history of the world. All of that was in the world with us.\u201d\n\nThey worked with an intimacy director for the play\u2019s multiple sex scenes \u2013 only the second Broadway show to do so.\n\nDuring rehearsals, he said, the team was predominantly formed of black women. The smallest demographic was white men.\n\n\u201cOn any given day, two white men in the space. That dynamic does not happen on Broadway normally. Normally it\u2019s a room full of white people and mostly white men running things,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. \u201cThat to me in itself led for a different type of conversation in a different type of environment.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday night, only the fourth night of previews, audience members queued down the street in the rain to get in and the cast performed to an almost full house.\n\nIn the auditorium the audience was vocal in their reactions \u2013 laughing regularly and at one point breaking out into spontaneous applause mid-scene \u2013 and gave a standing ovation at the end.\n\nOutside the theatre, audience members said it would take time to process the experience.\n\nSandra Hood, 62, a senior court clerk from New York, said she was attracted to the play by its provocative title and the reviews of its first run. \u201cIt sounded like something that would make me want to make my own opinion, because it sounded like there was quite a bit of polarity.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m digesting it \u2026 I\u2019m still sort of scratching my head about what point or points were intended, so it\u2019s going to be very individual, what you walk away with.\u201d\n\nParis West, 29, a marketing associate from Westchester county, does not go to the theatre very often and when she does, she usually prefers musicals.\n\nShe said: \u201cI\u2019m still processing it. There are a lot of themes. I sat with my mum so I\u2019m really interested in how she feels about it, but yeah, it was great \u2026 I haven\u2019t seen anything like it before, it\u2019s very provocative.\u201d\n\nEarly viewers on Broadway have so far included the author Roxane Gay, who praised it on Twitter, saying it was \u201cincendiary and moving and hilarious and brilliant and uncomfortable and painful and true\u201d.\n\nHamilton star and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda enthused: \u201cDear Jeremy, I can\u2019t be at opening but I\u2019m dying to see your play and I\u2019m so excited it\u2019s on Bway.\u201d", "description": "The drama tackling race, sex and slavery by the youngest black male playwright on Broadway is seeing queues and grabbing the attention of theater\u2019s biggest names", "authors": ["Miranda Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d45bf3501d7f89144bc4c7e371bc785f7fa83618/88_0_5251_3153/master/5251.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=99e88e42526464d4a8ec183053bef84a", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
