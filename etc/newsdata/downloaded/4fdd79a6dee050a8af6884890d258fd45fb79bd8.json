U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and presidential adviser Jared Kushner would also attend the conference after canceling last year, U.S. officials said.\n\n\"Removing barriers facing entrepreneurs generates better jobs, more tax revenues, and higher incomes, all of which are necessary to reduce poverty and raise living standards,\" Malpass said in a statement.\n\nCritics however say the report is too heavily weighted in favor of deregulation.\n\n\"This is a pure measure of deregulation. This index takes a fairly extreme position on market fundamentalism,\" said Justin Sandefur, a fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington.\n\nNEW ZEALAND NO.1\n\nThe top 10 rankings in the survey were largely unchanged from a year ago, with New Zealand holding its top spot, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark, South Korea, the United States, Georgia, Britain, Norway and Sweden.\n\nChina saw its ranking climb 15 places to 31st, a move Djankov attributes to domestic reforms prompted by trade tensions with the United States.\n\nPakistan and Nigeria also made big jumps as a result of internally focused reforms in the face of trade difficulties.\n\nLatin American countries lagged in the rankings, with Argentina falling seven places to 126th, and Mexico, the region's highest-ranking economy, falling six spots to 60th. The World Bank said that for the second year in a row, Mexico made no major business climate improvements.\n\nChile fell three places to 59th. The South American commodity exporter was at the center of a controversy in January 2018 over changes to the study's methodologies, which former World Bank chief economist Paul Romer said may have been biased against the country's socialist president at the time, Michelle Bachelet.\n\nRomer left the bank shortly after airing his views in a Wall Street Journal interview. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-worldbank-economist-romer/world-bank-economist-paul-romer-quits-after-chile-comments-idUSKBN1FD38Y", "description": "Gulf countries climb World Bank business climate rankings, Latin America fades", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9N042_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
