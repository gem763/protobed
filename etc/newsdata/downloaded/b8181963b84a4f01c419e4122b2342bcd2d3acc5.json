Cameron Maybin and Clint Frazier homered for good measure in the eighth, and Aroldis Chapman struck out Albert Pujols to end it as fans\u2019 cellphones flashed to record to moment.\n\nPlayers lined up for handshakes and hugs, more exuberantly than usual, but there was no wild celebration on the field.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Yankees star pitcher Domingo Germ\u00e1n was placed on administrative leave under Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy on Thursday, casting doubt over whether New York\u2019s top winner this season will be available for the playoffs.\n\nManager Aaron Boone was informed of the decision while he was driving to Yankee Stadium for a game against the Los Angeles Angels. New York won 9-1 to clinch its first AL East title since 2012.\n\nDetails on what prompted the action weren\u2019t disclosed. The leave may last up to seven days, barring an extension.\n\nThe Yankees begin the AL playoffs on Oct. 4, likely at home.\n\nA 27-year-old right-hander from the Dominican Republic who made his major league debut in 2017, Germ\u00e1n entered this season with a 2-7 record in 14 starts and 14 relief appearances. He became a full-time member of the rotation after ace Luis Severino got hurt in spring training and is 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 24 starts and three relief appearances over 143 innings.\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Miami Marlins manager Don Mattingly has agreed to a contract extension and will return for a fifth season in 2020, a person familiar with the negotiations said Thursday.\n\nThe person confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Marlins hadn\u2019t announced the deal. A news conference with CEO Derek Jeter was scheduled for Friday.\n\nMattingly\u2019s contract was to expire after this season. He became the Marlins\u2019 manager in 2016 and has guided the team during a rebuilding project under Jeter, who traded away All-Stars Christian Yelich, Giancarlo Stanton, Marcell Ozuna, Dee Gordon and J.T. Realmuto.\n\n-By AP Sports Writer Steven Wine.\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. of the Atlanta Braves has become only the third player in baseball history to hit 40 homers while 21 years old or younger.\n\nThe other two were Eddie Mathews and Mel Ott, who are both in the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 21-year-old Acu\u00f1a launched a two-run shot Thursday in the third inning, a towering 432-foot drive into the second level at SunTrust Park off Philadelphia\u2019s Aaron Nola.\n\nWith eight games left in the regular season, Acu\u00f1a also has a shot at becoming just the fifth player in baseball history to hit 40 homers and steal 40 bases in a season. He has 37 stolen bases.\n\nMathews hit 47 homers as a 21-year-old for the Milwaukee Braves in 1953. Ott was 20 when he hit 42 homers for the New York Giants in 1929.\n\nNFL\n\nDAVIE, Fla. (AP) - Desperate for help, the Miami Dolphins are turning to Josh Rosen.\n\nThe second-year pro will replace Ryan Fitzpatrick this week as the starting quarterback and try to jump-start a team that has been outscored 102-10 in the first two games.\n\nA person familiar with the decision by rookie coach Brian Flores confirmed the change to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because the team had not announced it.\n\nRosen can\u2019t fix all of the rebuilding Dolphins\u2019 many problems, but he\u2019s considered a potential franchise quarterback and will make his first start for Miami at Dallas on Sunday.\n\n-By AP Sports Writer Steven Wine.\n\nNHL\n\nOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) - Ottawa Senators defenseman Thomas Chabot has agreed to an eight-year, $64 million contract extension.\n\nThe agreement locks up another member of Ottawa\u2019s young core. The rebuilding Senators, coming off a last-place finish, signed center Colin White to a six-year extension last month.\n\nThe 22-year-old Chabot had 14 goals and 55 points in his first full NHL season in 2018-19. He was drafted 18th overall in 2015.\n\nGeneral manager Pierre Dorion on Thursday called him an \u201cexceptional talent and an outstanding teammate.\u201d\n\nIn the past couple of seasons, Ottawa traded three of its best players - Erik Karlsson, Mark Stone and Matt Duchene - after failing to settle on contract terms.\n\nWNBA\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Mystics forward Elena Delle Donne has been named 2019 WNBA MVP in a near-unanimous vote.\n\nDelle Donne received 41 of 43 first-place votes after leading Washington to a league-best 26-8 record. She is the first player in WNBA history to win MVP honors with two different teams after doing so in 2015 with Chicago.\n\nThe Mystics went 26-5 with Delle Donne in the starting lineup and lead the Las Vegas Aces 1-0 in their semifinal series. Delle Donne averaged 19.5 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists and shot a league-high 97.4% from the free throw line.\n\nDelle Done became the first player in WNBA history to shoot over 50% from the field, over 40% from 3-point territory and over 90% from the free throw line.\n\nWashington hosts Las Vegas in Game 2 on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "BASEBALL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
