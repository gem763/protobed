But we can definitely feel episodes coming, and we know how to handle them.\"\n\nShe also told the magazine that \u201cbeing on medication is not really an option, because it just changes who he is,\" and that \"traveling a lot does set it off, so he doesn\u2019t travel as much as he used to.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "She wants him to focus on his well-being and mental health too.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tJoCokPGBGvVcxP_PW2ylg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-980333702-1572257544.jpg?crop=0.973xw%3A0.324xh%3B0.00962xw%2C0.0705xh&resize=%2A%3A1440", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
