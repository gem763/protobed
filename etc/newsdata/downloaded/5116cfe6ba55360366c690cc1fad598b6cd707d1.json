Since 2015, they have been working with four other friends to create their own oasis.\n\nTheir small patch of land now offers up plentiful harvests of fruit and vegetables, a turquoise summer house and the prerequisite for any budding gardener in Germany \u2013 a trusty gnome.\n\n\u201cAfter work, I can come here for a couple of hours. I take my shoes off and I\u2019m immediately in a different state of mind,\u201d Vogler says.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about leisure; both men place a high value on the fruit and vegetables that they produce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a luxury really, that we don\u2019t have to depend on what we grow,\u201d says Vogler. \u201cThe supermarket\u2019s still down the road. But it definitely makes you more aware of where your food comes from and you know it\u2019s organic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe amount of work that goes into taking care of the garden also makes you appreciate what you\u2019re eating - and makes you realise what\u2019s in season,\u201d says Muscat. \u201cNowadays we\u2019ve got used to going to the store and seeing mangoes in the dead of winter. Where are we getting mangoes from in Germany when it\u2019s below freezing outside?\u201d\n\nThe increase in interest about where and how produce is grown is now reflected in the supermarket. The 2015 Nielsen Global Survey on Corporate Social Responsibility found that consumers polled across 60 countries were willing to pay extra for one thing: sustainability.\n\nThis was found to be particularly true for millennials; while 66% of global consumers were willing to pay more for sustainable goods, that figure rose to 73% among millennials.\n\n\n\nIn Germany, home to Europe\u2019s biggest market for organic produce, a 2019 study by Forsa also found that 28% of 18-29-year-olds would be willing to spend up to 50% more on ecological produce.\n\nChairman of the German Federation of Consumer Organisations Klaus M\u00fcller attributes the increase to the growing awareness of climate change, as well the influence of movements such as \u201cFriday\u2019s future\u201d, which was started by the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just about organic products anymore. It\u2019s also about how much packaging is used. People are asking: \u2018Is the produce farmed sustainably? What impact does this have on my carbon footprint? How many air miles is this product clocking up?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the only air miles in sight at Vogler and Muscat\u2019s allotment barbeque are overhead \u2013 from the odd plane coming into land at nearby Tegel airport.\n\nFriends of Muscat and Vogler have also benefited from their laborious new hobby.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been really positive about it,\u201d says Vogler. \u201cMy housemates give me their food waste for the compost heap and in return, they often end up with a bag of fresh vegetables \u2013 we have so much. Everyone\u2019s a winner.\u201d", "description": "Traditionally, \u2018Schreberg\u00e4rten\u2019 were considered the domain of the old and narrow-minded.
