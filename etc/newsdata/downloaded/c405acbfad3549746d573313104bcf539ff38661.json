Spadone had three catches for 110 yards.\n\nSan Diego stymied the Red Foxes' running game, holding them to just 39 rushing yards. Hunter Cobb scored the lone Marist touchdown on a 1-yard run but managed just 19 yards on eight carries.\n\nAustin Day was 19 of 34 passing for Marist (1-4, 1-2) but had four passes picked off, including a 46-yard pick-six by San Diego's David Tolbert, whose twin brother, Daniel, also had an interception.\n\nSan Diego now is 15-0 all-time against Marist and has scored 30 or more points in six of the last eight meetings. The Toreros beat Marist 35-7 in San Diego in 2017.\n\nSan Diego plays its first game outside of the state of California Saturday when it travels to face Davidson.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
