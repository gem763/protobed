The site recovered after hours of downtime only after being moved behind Cloudflare proxies.\n\nThe Notepad++ 7.8.1 release, the one codenamed \"Free Uyghur,\" has not been pulled, and is still available for download.\n\nYou can read the hundreds of pro- and anti-Chinese messages in the Notepad++ GitHub issue tracker's closed section.\n\nDeveloping story.
