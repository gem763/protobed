USA TODAY\n\nThere are a few things in tech that we really, really care about.\n\nOur smartphones, and using them for social networking, entertainment, taking selfies, and food porn.\n\nOur streaming players, as Roku and Amazon Fire Stick and connected speakers such as Echo and Google Home, to continue the entertainment experience at home.\n\nAnd handful of apps including Uber and Lyft to get around, and Google Maps and Waze to tell us how to get there.\n\nSo when we asked this week about your preference of navigation apps, we were surprised at the chord we appeared to have struck, and the passion.\n\nBob Boden's trip home via Waze (Photo: Bob Boden)\n\n\u201cWaze or Google Maps?\u201d asked Bob Whitmore on Twitter. \u201cHow about both?\u201d\n\nGoogle Maps, he says, scans for alternate routes, which Waze doesn\u2019t do, while Waze has toll and transponder information, and that\u2019s something not seen in Google Maps. \u201cBoth. Easy answer,\u201d he adds.\n\nWe were inspired to dive into this story based on a recent Google Maps update, which added new Waze-like tools, such as the ability for people to report crashes, speed traps and traffic slowdowns. These capabilities were long available on Android phones and are now opened up to Apple\u2019s iOS community.\n\nGoogle also added the ability to report four new types of incidents \u2013 construction, lane closures, disabled vehicles, and objects on the road (like debris) \u2013 to alert others about these potential obstructions.\n\nThis, indeed, makes Google Maps more like Waze.\n\nBut does it matter?\n\n@jeffersongraham Waze or Google Maps? Both! Waze on my way home to see why there's more traffic than usual and Google Maps when I'm traveling to find the closest restaurants or hotels on the road. I usually have Waze running too because it has gas stations on the map. \u2014 nikki ackerman (@vashjinn) October 22, 2019\n\nIt won\u2019t stop Nikki Ackerman from using both at the same time.\n\n\u201cWaze on my way home to see why there's more traffic than usual and Google Maps when I'm traveling to find the closest restaurants or hotels on the road,\u201d she wrote us, on Twitter. \u201cI usually have Waze running too because it has gas stations on the map.\u201d\n\nBut not everybody shared the sentiment.\n\nOn Facebook, Kathy Carson Newman said she swears by Google Maps. Period.\n\n\u201cIt integrates the Waze info without informing of every tire on the side of the road (which gets annoying) as well as gives you other info like restaurants that are in the area.\u201d\n\nAnd Brian Hawkins, also on Facebook, steers away from Waze because it \u201cseems too eager to use side streets which seem to save only 3% of time at expense of a 300% increase in stress.\u201d\n\nBob Boden, a Hollywood TV producer, didn't even consider Google Maps when he needed to get home to the San Fernando Valley Thursday night, in the midst of giant wildfires in Los Angeles.\n\nThey impact traffic heavily, and he figures that it he had stayed on the freeway, the jams would have been so excessive it would have taken 90 minutes to get home. Instead, with Waze, and some really wild and curvy side streets that he'd never seen before, he made it in just under an hour.\n\n\"Given the jams, it was a miracle i got there as quickly as I did,\" he says.\n\nBoden opts for Waze because it \"just works,\" he says, and he enjoys altering the voices of the navigator, a fun feature for Wazers. Sometimes he does Cookie Monster from Sesame Street, and now he's listening to a British female voice, because he likes the way she pronounces Boul-E-Vard. (You can even record your own voice, if you prefer to be navigated that way.)\n\nThese kind of extensive options are just not available in Google Maps. For now at least.\n\nThe Prince kisses Snow White goodbye, awakening her at the end of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'

Disney+ launches on Nov. 12. ICYMI, Apple TV+, which kicks off Nov. 1, will also be available for free, for one year, with the purchase of an iPhone, iPad, Macintosh computer or iPod Touch.\n\nWith Black Friday just about four weeks away, a consumer alert for shoppers: be on the lookout for skimming devices that crooks install at ATMs or at gas station pumps. E-Skimmers are also watching our online shopping carts, to steal our credit card and debit card information. What to do? Experts suggest that consumers don't use debit cards to shop online, because that's an easy tool for hackers to get access to your checking account \u2013 and to avoid entering credit card details into a website. Large stores, such as Amazon, will store your card in your account.\n\nThis week's Talking Tech podcasts\n\nFoodporn: Why you're seeing so much of it on Instagram.\n\nWaze or Google Maps?\n\nApple's first Hollywood premiere: Behind the scenes at For All Mankind, with Carly Mallenbaum.\n\nNude Selfies?
