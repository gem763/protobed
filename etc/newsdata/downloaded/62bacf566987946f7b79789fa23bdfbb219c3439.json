It is a major blow for South Africa, given Kolbe\u2019s renowned game-breaking and try-scoring ability.\n\nHe has lit up the World Cup in Japan with some of his performances, and Wales assistant coach Shaun Edwards recently likened his ability to that of England World Cup winner Jason Robinson.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing not to have Cheslin available as he has been brilliant for us since we first called him up last year,\u201d Springboks rugby director Rassie Erasmus said. \u201cBut we really rate Sbu, and he will slot straight in.\n\n\u201cI am as excited to see what he can do as I would be if \u2018Chessie\u2019 were playing. Sbu has been very close to selection as it is.\u201d\n\nErasmus has gone for a split of six forwards and just two backs among his replacements as South Africa bid to reach a third World Cup final.\n\nTeam: W Le Roux; S Nkosi, L Am, D de Allende, M Mapimpi; H Pollard, F de Klerk; T Mtawarira, M Mbonambi, F Malherbe, E Etzebeth, L de Jager, S Kolisi (capt), P S du-Toit, D Vermeulen.
