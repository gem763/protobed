A good phone to be sure, but the price was a touch high for incremental upgrades to what the Pixel 2 was already packing. But Google wasn't done. Last month it came in hot with its lite version of the device. Not only are the specs ridiculously similar to its bigger siblings, so is the camera. Oh and the battery is better. In one fell swoop Google fucked the mid-range phone market. In fact, it may have even fucked the high range one. It redefined what consumers should expect for $650 and thus threw the phone landscape into glorious chaos. And I for one worship it.

In the past it has indulged in the likes of Not Pink, Purple-ish and Kinda Blue. While some of these colours were on the muted side, this year's signature colour is bold and bright... and has a name to match. Read more\n\nUpdate August 12:\n\nAfter some initial spec leaks in mid-July, a more thorough info dump recently made its way online.\n\nIf it's to be believed, we're looking at a 5.7-inch Pixel 4 (slightly larger than the 3) and a 6.3-inch Pixel 4 XL with 2160 x 1080 HD+ and 2960 x 1440 QHD+ resolutions, respectively.\n\nIt said that the OLED screens will also have a sexy 90Hz refresh rate, which will make it one of the few phones in market with this capability - especially in Australia.\n\nUnder the hood the Pixel 4 is said to be finally getting a RAM upgrade to 6GB, with both 64GB and 128GB storage options. If you were hoping it would be launching with the new Snapdragon 855 Plus chip, we have some bad news - it's probably just getting the regular 855.\n\nAnother disappointment is the rumour that it will only have a 2,800mAH battery, which is actually a downgrade from the 2,915mAH in the Pixel 3.\n\nIf true we're hoping that there has is some significant power efficiency upgrades to explain the decision and ensure that the newer device has the same/improved battery life.\n\nIt is also rumoured that that the Pixel 4 will be replacing the second ultra-wide camera with a telephoto lens - and it's about time.\n\nYou can read more here:\n\nGoogle's Pixel 4 Specs Leak And Suggest Some Wild Stuff Is Happening To The Camera In the run-up to the next Made By Google event typically held later in the fall, Google has already shared the first official picture of the Pixel 4, along with info on all the fancy sensors and tech stashed inside its top bezel. Read more\n\nUpdate July 15:\n\nSome image leaks revealed a mammoth camera bump that that sure seems massive compared to the sleek photos Google itself showed off last month.\n\nIt looks quite imposing and ugly and we're scared.\n\nYou can read more about it here:\n\nThe Google Pixel 4 Camera Bump Is THICC It's phone leak season, and this year Google has even been getting in on the fun by leaking its own stuff because why not? While the latest image to hit the web isn't from Google itself, it sure is striking fear into the hearts of Pixel fans. Read more\n\nLet's start with the facts. On June 13 the Made By Google Twitter account released this image in response to some leaked renders that were already making the rounds.\n\nWell, since there seems to be some interest, here you go! Wait 'til you see what it can do. #Pixel4 pic.twitter.com/RnpTNZXEI1 \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) June 12, 2019\n\nThe reveal here is a square camera bump at the rear, which shirks what a lot of the other big name phone manufacturers are doing at the moment. Except for Huawei, which pretty much had an extremely similar design for its Mate 20 series last year.\n\nImage: Sam Rutherford\n\nThe original leaked renders came from Pricebaba, which look bang on and was shared by notorious phone leaker @onleaks on Twitter. I guess that's why Google decided to throw down.\n\nAnd here comes your very first glimpse at the #Google #Pixel4 in form of gorgeous 5K renders based upon early prototyping schematics, on behalf of my Friends over @Pricebaba -> https://t.co/gjbtMlybdg (Please read the full story before reacting in order to make educated comments) pic.twitter.com/ZZAiseB9WP \u2014 Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) June 10, 2019\n\nWhen it comes to specs, we don't know much yet. However, there have been some leaked benchmarks which indicate that we could be looking down the barrel of a Snapdragon 855 processor, which would be a step up from the 845 that the Google Pixel 3 series has.\n\nWe have also heard that 6GB RAM will be under the hood, as well as the latest Android Q software, which we still demand should be named Android Quince.\n\nYou can also expect to see some amusing colour name variations as per usual, as well as a 'lite' version of the handset. However, considering that the 3a only just came out, we're thinking that its replacement won't make an appearance until 2020.\n\nConsidering how incremental the spec upgrades were between the Pixel 2 and 3, we're really hoping to be blown away this time around. The Pixel 3 was a good series, and we are in love with the 3a, but for a flagship price point it's okay to expect more.\n\nWe'll let you know if any more info or leaks emerge.", "description": "We're still a few months out from when Google will most likely unveil the Google Pixel 4.
