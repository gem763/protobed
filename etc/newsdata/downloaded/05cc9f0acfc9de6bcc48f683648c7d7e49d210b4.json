Instead, it\u2019s a bulbous, 12-foot-tall sphere that resembles a bird\u2019s nest, perched on a hill above her vineyard in southern Australia.\n\nVisitors who book the new \u201cwhimsical hand-woven tasting nest,\u201d as Ms. Golding\u2019s website describes it, are treated to a three-hour, multiple-course lunch and wine, plus an expansive view of vineyards and hills in the distance\u2014for the equivalent of $115 per person. Six people can fit comfortably inside, where guests sit on cushions on the floor.\n\nSome customers are \u201ctaken aback by the scale of it,\u201d says Ms. Golding, adding that it took her and others about 50 hours to weave willow branches around the steel frame. \u201cThis is very much a human-sized nest. It towers over you when you\u2019re in there.\u201d\n\nEven a fancy restaurant or art gallery isn\u2019t always enough to stand out or attract visitors to wineries these days, especially as many younger vacationers seek out increasingly unique experiences. Winemakers, particularly in newer wine-producing countries like Australia and the U.S., are toning down discussions about tannins and terroir\u2014and trying to outdo each other with wine nests, floating golf holes, climbing walls, petting zoos, strange museums and 35-foot-tall rabbit sculptures.\n\nIn Europe, some winemakers also offer attractions, but \u201cthe bedrock of their success in the wine sector is based on tradition and history,\u201d said Damien Wilson, a professor at Sonoma State University in California and a chair at the school\u2019s Wine Business Institute.\n\nOne California winery he recently visited was \u201calmost like Disneyland for adults,\u201d he said.\n\nThat winery, Raymond Vineyards in California\u2019s Napa Valley, offers a series of themed rooms including the Corridor of Senses, where visitors squeeze fabric-covered balls on flasks attached to the wall for a whiff of aromas, such as black pepper and honey, that are present in wine. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a blank canvas\u201d in the U.S., said Jean-Charles Boisset, a Frenchman who runs the Boisset Collection, which owns the winery. He also oversees wineries in France, where his business opened a tasting lounge in the Burgundian village of Vougeot that sports a \u201cchic and theatrical atmosphere,\u201d its website says.\n\nRaymond Vineyards in California\u2019s Napa Valley offers a series of themed rooms including the Corridor of Senses Photo: Scott Chebegia\n\nThe Red Room at Raymond Vineyards in Napa Valley.

A tasting nest didn\u2019t appear on the list\u2014though one winery offered a tasting on a suspended platform in a tree.\n\nNot everyone in this tradition-focused industry, which still debates whether to use corks or screw tops on wine bottles, is fully embracing the idea. Simon Woolf, an English wine writer based in the Netherlands, said he generally prefers a comfortable and quiet space to taste wine, and where he can ideally chat with the winemaker.\n\n\u201cMy take would probably be that wineries have to decide if their focus is making the best possible wine, or becoming a tourist attraction,\u201d said Mr. Woolf. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a winery to achieve both, in my experience.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts What\u2019s better? The wine or the experience? Join the conversation below.\n\nTo some visitors, the offbeat attractions might initially seem out of place. The 35-foot-tall statue of a leaping rabbit at Hall Wines in Napa Valley seemed unusual to Mr. Wilson, the business professor, given that rabbits can be vineyard pests. Called Bunny Foo Foo, the statue, visible from the highway, is actually a homage to the nursery rhyme that one of the winery owners used to sing with her children.\n\nThe Hall Wines Bunny Foo Foo statue in Halloween-themed decor.

When new Star Wars movies were released, a big lightsaber was placed in the front paw of the rabbit, then sometimes called Saber Foo Foo.\n\n\u201cPeople pull over every day and stop to take pictures of it,\u201d said Mike Reynolds, the president of the winery, which sells some bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon for more than $200. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun, and wine is supposed to be fun.\u201d\n\nOn San Francisco\u2019s Treasure Island, home to a former naval base, vintner Bryan Kane hosts his tasting room in a former training facility that used to be partially flooded so sailors could practice what to do if a ship were sinking. The interior of the tasting room at Sottomarino Winery\u2014that\u2019s Italian for \u201csubmarine\u201d\u2014resembles the inside of a ship, complete with bulkhead doors and portholes.\n\n\u201cPeople either love or hate the concept,\u201d said Mr. Kane, who makes a Dolcetto that was once judged to be the best in the U.S. at a wine competition sponsored by San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic submarine training unit. We wanted to embrace that.\u201d\n\nPart of the submarine theme at the Sottomarino Winery. Photo: Sottomarino Winery\n\nA party at Sottomarino Winery in San Francisco.

In the Australian state of Queensland, which is known for its tropical beaches and rainforests, Cedar Creek Estate Vineyard and Winery built a cave out of concrete about 15 years ago\u2014to house insect larvae that glow in the dark and are known as glow-worms. About half of the visitors to the property go for the glow-worms and don\u2019t even bother with the wine, according to owner John Penglis.\n\nMr. Penglis next wants to build an aviary so visitors can check out native birds. \u201cI don\u2019t worry what others think,\u201d Mr. Penglis said when asked if more-traditional winemakers snub him.\n\nBack at Golding Wines, one of the first groups to book the wine nest earlier this year included Simon Conn, a 40-year-old academic who lives nearby and says he usually prefers a traditional wine-tasting experience. Still, he enjoyed throwing a football around near the nest and appreciated the personal concierge that looked after his group.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t make up for a bad winery with some gimmick,\u201d said Mr. Conn, who would visit the tasting nest again and was a fan of the wine. \u201cBut you can certainly raise it to another level.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com", "description": "Even a fancy restaurant or art gallery isn\u2019t enough to stand out among wineries these days; \u2018almost like Disneyland for adults\u2019", "authors": ["Mike Cherney", "Mike.Cherney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104858/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
