For no reason. At all. We won\u2019t be able to afford a house thanks to the lack of housing market regulation we inherited, pricing us out for a generation at least. We predominantly won\u2019t be interested in investing in financial products like bonds or ISA\u2019s, because the recession led to nauseatingly low interest rate returns and \u2013 also, erm, nobody bothered to teach us about things like that in school, or at home?\n\nThat, amid all of the necessary bills that need paying just to keep our heads above water, means the idea of saving every penny can feel distant from our everyday realities.", "description": "Faarea Masud from the All About The Money podcast explains why she's quit saving money", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07ptb54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
