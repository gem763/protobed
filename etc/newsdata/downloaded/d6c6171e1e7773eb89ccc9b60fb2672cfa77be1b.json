Reminder of mobilization throughout France this week to defend the Rojava against the Turkish invasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Turkish invasion is synonymous with massacres, ethnic cleansing, humanitarian drama. It will bog down Syria in an even deeper war and cause a mass exodus,\u201d the group added in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, pro-Kurdish protestors marched in Marseille, flying flags of the YPG militia, along with flags bearing the image of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader and one of the founders of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), considered a left-wing terrorist group and proscribed in the United Kingdom.\n\nSalih Azad, spokesperson of the Kurdish Democratic Centre of Marseille attended the protest and told French media, \u201cThe international community can and must mobilize more to stop the genocide of the Kurdish people. We really condemn the attitude of the Americans who stabbed the Kurds in the back!\u201d\n\nIn Paris, tensions between protestors and police were high on Thursday evening as video footage showed protestors with PKK leader Ocalan flags face-off with officers.\n\nIl semble qu'il y a des tensions entre les manifestants kurdes et la police \u00e0 Paris. Il faut que les policiers comprennent la col\u00e8re et le d\u00e9sespoir des kurdes. Leur peuple est extermin\u00e9 devant les cam\u00e9ras en direct.

Earlier this year, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz also banned the symbols of the group, including its flags.\n\nIn Germany, the PKK, along with their alt-left extremist Antifa allies, have been linked to the firebombing of Turkish-run mosques, while in France PKK members were arrested in Marseille for financing terrorism in 2010 and six more PKK members were arrested in 2012 after an assassination attempt.\n\nTurkish leader has vowed to \u201copen the gates\u201d for millions of illegal migrants to enter Europe if the European Union dares to brand his operations in Syria an invasion.\n\nTurkey, Hezbollah Order EU to \u2018Kneel\u2019 or \u2018We Open the Gates and Send 3.6 Million Refugees Your Way\u2019 https://t.co/xyRxrdVdak \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2019", "description": "Kurdish activists in France are planning protests against Turkish operations in Syria after tense scenes between Kurds and police in Paris.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1125174972-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
