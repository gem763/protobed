The cases range from allegations of vague social media threats from juveniles that set parents on edge to well-developed plots from people who had access to weapons and appeared to authorities to have been planning a mass murder. There were roughly a dozen cases involving right-wing ideology. There were at least a dozen alleged threats against schools. There were half a dozen cases involving alleged threats against Walmarts.\n\nIn the wake of El Paso, law enforcement is clearly paying very close attention to threats of mass violence. Our review of court filings reveals that federal law enforcement officials, after El Paso, took investigative steps against a few defendants who had been already been on their radar.\n\nAnd some of those arrested were inspired by the El Paso attack, according to authorities. The public is paying closer attention as well, as evidenced by the spike in tips to the FBI after that Aug. 3 massacre.\n\n\u201cIn the first week in August, the FBI saw an increase in tips submitted to the National Threat Operations Center,\u201d the bureau said in a statement, referring to the FBI component that operates 1-800-Call-FBI and sorts through information submitted to tips.fbi.gov. \u201cSuch increases are often observed after major incidents. As always, the FBI encourages the public to remain vigilant and report any and all suspicious activity to law enforcement immediately.\u201d\n\nIn a statement after the El Paso attack, the FBI said it \u201cremains concerned that U.S.-based domestic violent extremists could become inspired by these and previous high-profile attacks to engage in similar acts of violence.\u201d That concern was emphasized in a call with the FBI leaders and state and local partners just after the mass shootings in El Paso and, a day later, in Dayton, Ohio, according to the bureau.\n\nA number of the alleged threats, if carried out, would have qualified as instances of domestic terrorism. A top FBI official told reporters this year that domestic terrorism cases were \u201cchallenging\u201d for the bureau. The disparate handling of right-wing and Islamic terrorism has set off a debate over the need for a domestic terrorism law, and one prominent lawmaker has introduced such legislation, which has already raised objections from civil liberties advocates.\n\nAs of late July, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Senate committee that the FBI had already been involved in 100 domestic terrorism-related arrests in the first three-quarters of the 2019 fiscal year, which began in October 2018. The rapid pace of new cases suggests that the number of domestic terrorism-related cases in the 2019 fiscal year could outpace the 2017 and 2018 fiscal year figures. Bureau officials said they\u2019ll use any tool they can to take out a potential threat, and a review of the cases suggests the FBI was involved in a number of cases that resulted in local charges.\n\n\u201cIt may not be evident in the face of the crime or who\u2019s involved working it that it\u2019s a domestic terrorism suspect who was arrested,\u201d an FBI official previously said. \u201cWe use anything [in federal law] we can that fits, that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe case of Thomas Bolin illustrates the challenge these cases pose for the FBI. Bolin, a 22-year-old from New York, moderated a white supremacist forum. He was arrested by the FBI after allegedly discussing an attack with his cousin. He posted a photo of himself wearing a mask and holding a gun, then lied to the FBI about his weapon.\n\nBolin was given a sentence, for lying to the FBI, of time served after spending about three months behind bars and was released early last month. The challenge in finding an applicable federal charge, in part, could help explain why less than a quarter of the arrests surveyed by HuffPost in the past four weeks resulted in federal charges.\n\nThe First Week After El Paso\n\nBack in February, FBI agents in Anchorage noticed that a user who went by \u201cArmyOfChrist\u201d on the web forum iFunny was discussing \u201csupporting mass shooting\u201d and the \u201cassault and/or targeting of Planned Parenthood.\u201d At one point, ArmyOfChrist wrote, \u201cIn conclusion, shoot every federal agent on sight.\u201d Subpoenas indicated that a Gmail account associated with the iFunny account was registered to 18-year-old Justin Olsen. The case was reassigned to the FBI\u2019s Youngstown, Ohio, field office on Aug. 2, the day before the El Paso attack. On Aug 7, according to an FBI affidavit, agents found about 10,000 rounds of ammunition, camouflage clothing and camouflaged backpacks, along with about 15 rifles and 10 semiautomatic pistols. Olsen faces a charge of threatening to assault a federal law enforcement officer.\n\nDaniel Waters, a 22-year-old from Illinois, was arrested for alleged domestic battery on Aug. 7 after a dispute with his mother, according to court records. He was soon charged by state authorities with a felony count of unlawful possession of explosive material. Law enforcement officials, according to a news release, found a \u201cdiatribe written by Waters which describes starting a militia and their operations.\u201d Lombard\u2019s police chief thanked the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) for its assistance in the case.\n\nConor Climo, 23, of Las Vegas, an alleged white supremacist who worked as a security guard, first came under FBI scrutiny in April 2019. According to an Aug. 9 affidavit from an FBI special agent who works on the Las Vegas Joint Terrorism Task Force and investigates domestic terrorism and racially motivated violent extremism, an FBI source began interacting with Climo in an encrypted online chat in May.\n\nBy mid-July, Climo was allegedly telling an undercover FBI employee posing as an associate of the National Socialist Movement about his plans to attack a Las Vegas synagogue. Several weeks went by, then El Paso happened. Days later, on Aug. 8, the FBI executed a search warrant on Climo\u2019s residence, seizing items they say Climo intended to use to construct a bomb. He faces a federal count of possession of an unregistered firearm for the bomb materials.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 20-year-old Dmitry Andreychenko walked into a Walmart in Springfield, Missouri. He allegedly wore body armor and carried a loaded rifle, 100 rounds of ammunition and a handgun. Scared customers at the store called police, who arrived quickly and arrested Andreychenko.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know if that Walmart honored the Second Amendment,\u201d he allegedly explained to police. \u201cHis intent was not to cause peace or comfort to anybody that was in the business here,\u201d Springfield Police Lt. Mike Lucas told journalists at the scene. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s lucky he\u2019s alive still, to be honest.\u201d\n\nPolice in Weslaco, Texas, with assistance from the FBI, arrested an unidentified 13-year-old male on Aug. 8 after the teen posted a threat to Instagram targeting a local Walmart. The juvenile was brought to police by his mother. Rumors of the threat caused the Walmart to temporarily close. The teen was charged with a felony count of making a terroristic threat.\n\nRichard Clayton allegedly posted an alarming message to Facebook just four days after the El Paso shooting. \u201c3 more days of probation left then I get my AR-15 back,\u201d Clayton, a 26-year-old from Winter Park, Florida, allegedly wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t go to Walmart next week.\u201d\n\nThe FBI received a tip about the post, which it passed on to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Authorities arrested Clayton on Aug. 9. According to a police affidavit, Clayton repeatedly asked an arresting officer if he was Hispanic. \u201cThey are what is wrong with this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come in and are ruining everything.\u201d\n\nClayton is now charged with intimidation through a written threat to kill or do bodily harm, a state-level offense. The affidavit also revealed a series of white supremacist messages Clayton allegedly posted to Facebook. Police stated he posted a swastika to the social media platform in September 2018 and earlier that year wrote: \u201cImagine for a moment that we\u2019ve established our ethnostate, physically removed all the commies and degenerates, and white birth rates are back in the positives. Who would there be left to make fun of?\u201d\n\nAnthony Reed, 33, was arrested on Aug. 9 after telling a Walmart employee he\u2019d bring a weapon to the store if the remote control car he was buying malfunctioned police said. \u201cI\u2019m serious about my money,\u201d Reed allegedly told the employee. \u201cIf I get home and this is broken, I\u2019m going to snap and come back here with a gun.\u201d\n\nReed was charged with a state felony count of making a false report of using a firearm in a violent manner. According to the police report, Reed could be a sovereign citizen, a type of anti-government extremist who believes they are not subject to U.S., state and local laws.\n\nThe Second Week\n\nPolice in Harlingen, Texas, arrested Jose Luis Gonzalez Jr. on Aug. 10 after he allegedly posted a threat to Facebook targeting a local Walmart. \u201cHarlingen Walmart will be shot up on August 11,\u201d he allegedly wrote.
