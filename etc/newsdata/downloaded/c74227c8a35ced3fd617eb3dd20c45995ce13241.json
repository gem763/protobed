I suspect that neither do most of you, either. All I know is that I really, really want to pass a lot of popcorn after watching Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s latest fundraising video, even if I don\u2019t want to open my wallet. Gabbard attacks Hillary Clinton as part of the \u201ccorrupt elite,\u201d and claims that Hillary\u2019s smear of her as a Russian asset is payback for Gabbard\u2019s endorsement of Bernie Sanders in 2016.\n\nPut some extra butter flavoring on that popcorn, will ya?\n\nHillary & her gang of rich, powerful elite are going after me to send a msg to YOU: \u201cShut up, toe the line, or be destroyed.\u201d But we, the people, will NOT be silenced. Join me in taking our Democratic Party back & leading a govt of, by & for the people! https://t.co/TOcAOPrxye pic.twitter.com/TahfE2XOek \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 20, 2019\n\nGabbard had been relegated to the sidelines after derailing Kamala Harris in the second debate at the end of July. She barely qualified for last week\u2019s debate but didn\u2019t get a memorable moment out of it. Until Hillary Clinton offered up her lunatic Russians-Russians-Everywhere conspiracy theory about Gabbard being a Russian asset, few people gave her a second thought.\n\nSuddenly, though, Gabbard is hot news, and she\u2019s striking while the iron is hot. On Friday, Gabbard called her \u201ccowardly\u201d and dared her to enter the Democratic primary to keep her mouth shut. Oh, and it was Barzini all along, because Tattaglia was a pimp, or something:\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nIn her email on Saturday, Gabbard accused Clinton of being behind \u201ca campaign to destroy my reputation\u201d while reiterating her comments from the previous day calling the former secretary of State \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d \u201cWe must not let Hillary Clinton and her establishment allies silence the voice of the American people and quash all those who dare to offer a dissenting voice in response to our corrupt status quo,\u201d Gabbard said in the email.\n\nTune in to the next exciting episode, when Gabbard wakes up to find a horse\u2019s head in her bed! Or the other end of a horse, which might reflect Hillary a little more accurately after her \u201cRussian asset\u201d rant.\n\nNone of this is to argue that Gabbard\u2019s a voice of reason in the radical-progressive chorus we see in the Democratic primaries. Her embrace of Bashar al-Assad was shameful and grotesque, for instance, and for the most part Gabbard\u2019s part of that same chorus anyway. Even her pushback against Hillary is from the left; Gabbard didn\u2019t endorse Bernie Sanders for nothing, after all. That doesn\u2019t make her wrong about the Clintons and their \u201ccorrupt elite\u201d political machine, nor of Hillary\u2019s cheap-shot tactics from the cheap seats. But if Hillary wants to keep characterizing Democrats in the 2020 field as hopelessly bought by the Russians, well, who are we to stop her?\n\nAll this does is make me hungry \u2026 for even more popcorn.
