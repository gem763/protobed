The former child star and teenage action hero, latter-day performance artist and Hollywood outcast vapes as a tune plays on his phone. The song is Our House by 1970s supergroup Crosby, Stills and Nash. (\u201cA very, very, very fine house.\u201d) He dances. \u201cWhat do you want to listen to?\u201d he asks the other actor in the room, Zack Gottsagen. \u201cPick a song.\u201d Gottsagen, who has Down\u2019s syndrome, shrugs and looks across at me. \u201cHe\u2019s from the Guardian,\u201d LaBeouf says in a tone that might be called sceptical. He switches off the music. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s talk our shit.\u201d\n\nAhead of this interview, I watch YouTube footage of LaBeouf\u2019s 2017 arrest for public drunkenness in Savannah, Georgia. Physically, he looks much the same now, beard and T-shirt and worked-on upper arms. Then I watch The Peanut Butter Falcon, the film he was making at the time. It stars Gottsagen as a young man with Down\u2019s syndrome who goes on the run from the retirement home he has been placed in by the state, joining a fugitive fisherman played by LaBeouf on an escape along the eastern seaboard. The result \u2013 charming, Mark Twain-ish \u2013 was the sleeper hit of the US summer. For Gottsagen, 34, the bustle of interviews and film festivals is something new. LaBeouf, 33, is less excited. \u201cI\u2019ve been on this rollercoaster several times,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the only way for it to be fun is to do it with someone who has never been on it before.\u201d\n\nGottsagen has been acting in amateur plays since he was a child, inspired by Grease and Hairspray, with a striking gift as a performer. In the film, he and LaBeouf play off each other beautifully. \u201cI always wanted to do acting to express my feelings and also to show people my abilities,\u201d he says. He met writer-directors Tyler Nilson and Mike Schwartz at a California film-making camp for actors with and without disabilities. The three resolved to make a feature to showcase Gottsagen \u2013 a herculean task given their lack of industry connections.\n\nFor a time, Nilson pitched the project while living in a tent in LA. When the idea did reach executives, the conversations ended when Nilson said that it would star an actual actor with Down\u2019s. Finally, with a modest budget at last in place, the trio\u2019s \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d video was sent to LaBeouf. It was April 2017, the actor en route to a performance art project \u2013 a month alone in a remote Lapland cabin, from where he watched the video over and over.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gottsagen and LaBeouf in The Peanut Butter Falcon.

He is shaking his head before I\u2019ve finished the question. \u201cNot novelty. Novelty\u2019s a shit word. There\u2019s no novelty to Base jumping. Right? There\u2019s no novelty to skydiving. Novelty is safe. This didn\u2019t feel safe.\u201d There is a long moment of eye contact. \u201cThis felt like lighting yourself on fire.\u201d\n\nI ask Gottsagen if he knew about his co-star before the film, and he nods and lists the hits of the chipper first act of the Shia LaBeouf story \u2013 the sitcom Even Stevens he starred in at 14, the Transformers movies, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Beyond that, LaBeouf himself is acutely aware, the references get darker. The paper bag reading \u201cI Am Not Famous Anymore\u201d worn over his head at the premiere of Lars von Trier\u2019s Nymphomaniac. The plagiarism of graphic novelist Daniel Clowes with his film Howard Cantour.com. The many run-ins with the police. The general air of hot mess.\n\nMy life had exploded again and I was in deep shame. This film saved me\n\nLa Beouf rarely deals with journalists any more. Before his last major interview, promoting the film McEnroe vs Borg in 2018 \u2013 naturally, he played John McEnroe \u2013 he spent weeks with his therapist preparing answers to potential questions. His publicist insisted that all the questions for this interview focus on The Peanut Butter Falcon. Among the subjects implied to be off limits is Honey Boy, another new movie that LaBeouf stars in and wrote, about his early life as a child actor. He plays his own father. There is talk of Oscars for script and performance.\n\nLaBeouf\u2019s answers tend to come as monologues. He describes returning to the US after a lonely month in Lapland to meet Gottsagen for the first time, the pair driven by van to Georgia to start preparing for the shoot. LaBeouf, skittish and talkative, was disarmed by his co-star\u2019s silence. Eventually, they held hands. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at this motherfucker\u2019s hands, but these are the most beautiful hands, and something about holding them calmed all my fear.\u201d The story is sweet, vividly told, and if transcribed in full, would take up half this piece.\n\nGottsagen\u2019s memories of the drive are snappier. \u201cI could tell Shia was a badass,\u201d he says. But for him, the journey was still more profound, his film finally being made after a life of being told he could never be a professional actor. He wanted, he says, the industry to understand that disabled actors could be movie stars, too.\n\nAlthough he has lived independently for several years, his mother Shelley remains a major presence in his life. Before filming began, LaBeouf says, she and he had a frank conversation. \u201cOn paper, I\u2019m a fuck-up.\u201d He says this matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019m not Tom Hanks. Search my name on the internet and you\u2019re going to find a list of scary things. So it was a risk for them.\u201d He wanted, he says, to spend as much time as possible with Gottsagen, mimicking their characters\u2019 relationship. \u201cFor Zack, that was going to be uncomfortable, because here\u2019s this dude who doesn\u2019t want to go away. I don\u2019t want to go to another room. I want to be in his room. I couldn\u2019t ask certain actors for that. Certain actors are too professional.\u201d\n\nIn the evenings during the shoot, the pair routinely hung out. They watched wrestling, much loved by Gottsagen, and scolded each other over their vices: Gottsagen ate too much ice-cream; LaBeouf drank too much gin. Alcohol has long been a problem.\n\nAt 4am on 8 July 2017, a drunk LaBeouf was arrested in Savannah, having initially approached a stranger for a cigarette. Evidence of how the situation escalated is widely available online, including bodycam footage from a black police officer who, the actor ranted at length, should not have been arresting \u201ca white person who gives a fuck\u201d in the age of Trump. LaBeouf was bailed later that morning, by which time word had reached the production, and everywhere else besides.\n\nLaBeouf talks about his return to set in the present tense. \u201cI can\u2019t look anyone in the eye. And I can\u2019t come to terms with it. And no one\u2019s talking to me and I\u2019m talking to no one, and I know my life has exploded again. And I am in deep shame.\u201d\n\nWith the legal fallout still uncertain, Gottsagen sat on the floor opposite LaBeouf, to tell him he had jeopardised his one chance of starring in a film. Don\u2019t blow this for me, he said. \u201cI was mad,\u201d Gottsagen says. \u201cAngry. Frustrated.\u201d Both men cried. \u201cAnd I was worried about Shia doing the wrong things, being out in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nWhen the shoot restarted, Nilson and Schwartz had the actors film a scene onboard a boat in which LaBeouf\u2019s character is overcome by guilt. As they waited for \u201caction\u201d to be called, without knowing the camera was already rolling, Gottsagen reached out and lay his hand on his co-star\u2019s back. LaBeouf crumpled into him. \u201cThat is not method acting bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be given permission to come into this man\u2019s life and the infractions still come \u2013 right then, I\u2019m broken. That\u2019s documentary.\u201d\n\nLaBeouf promised Gottsagen he would not drink for the rest of the shoot. Two years later, he is still sober. He later admitted the role in his case of white privilege (had he been arrested as a person of colour, other outcomes would have been likely). After filming came court-ordered rehab. There, a counsellor told him to write down the most significant events in his life story. Steeped in movies, he did so in script form, then sent that script to his friend, director Alma Har\u2019el.\n\nThe result became Honey Boy, titled after his father\u2019s pet name for him. Jeffrey LaBeouf was a Vietnam veteran and former heroin addict who is now resentfully on his son\u2019s payroll, the pre-teen Shia a jobbing actor on low-rent TV shows. A poor kid breadwinning in the space where a childhood is meant to go, without the boundaries that other 12-year-olds have, it makes the perfect recipe for an adulthood spent clashing with authority. The film is incredible \u2013 like a cartoon character turned flesh-and-blood in front of you, then telling you their innermost secrets.\n\nBy now, talking about it seems unavoidable. I ask LaBeouf which of his two new films feels more exposing. He answers without missing a beat. \u201cThis film is much more exposing than Honey Boy. Peanut Butter Falcon feels like real time. Like watching myself through a window. Honey Boy is a history. It hits hard, but it has novelty. It\u2019s less dangerous. It\u2019s much more something you put on a shelf.\u201d Because he wrote it himself? Crafted it? \u201cYeah. It seems more naked, right? It\u2019s not more naked. What it is, is a film about this clown mask everyone knows me for, that I\u2019ve been wearing a very long time. To me, it\u2019s not a revelation.\n\nPeople tell me to stay away from Shia. They don't understand the real him. I tell them I won't\n\n\u201cHoney Boy explains my life up to this point,\u201d he says. \u201cThis film saved my life. They\u2019re different things.\u201d\n\nThe tricksy nature of actors \u2013 suckers for a killer line \u2013 is not lost on LaBeouf. He also seems tired of make-believe. His career in studio movies has been put into deep freeze by his reputation, but much about his old life seems to go unmourned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been in love with it for a long time,\u201d he says. There was, he says, a lot of \u201cnovelty brotherhood\u201d. Even his performance art is dismissed. \u201cFake. Inauthentic.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest LaBeouf\u2019s bizarre headwear at the premiere of Nymphomaniac. Photograph: Picture Perfect/REX\n\nTwo years after leaving Georgia, he and Gottsagen are still frequently in touch. Outside the interview, they discuss attending the wrestling spectacular WrestleMania. LaBeouf has lately directed his energies towards Slauson Rec, the free acting school he co-founded in downtown LA; Gottsagen has taught other disabled actors for many years. LaBeouf talks about his honesty like a talisman.\n\n\u201cI look to him as an example. I know I come in defensive. I come in playing music. I say: \u2018Here we go with the Guardian.\u2019 I try to bring my world into the room. He doesn\u2019t. You came in here and he was sitting quietly. He\u2019s Paul Newman. So I look to him and I know I need to switch my life up.\u201d\n\nThe two now have their arms around each other. Gottsagen tells LaBeouf he loves him. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d LaBeouf says.\n\nHe starts to speak again, but Gottsagen \u2013 having spent the past few minutes sitting being talked about \u2013 has his own monologue to deliver. \u201cI have been changing Shia\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how I do things. And Shia has proved to himself he doesn\u2019t have to act out. So I\u2019m going to keep taking the chance of being close to him.\u201d Every word is measured, deliberate. \u201cA lot of people have come to me talking about Shia, and they always tell me: \u2018Stay away from Shia.\u2019 But I am not going to do that. My answer is: \u2018No.\u2019 Because people don\u2019t understand the real Shia. And those people need to stop saying those things about Shia. And I don\u2019t really care how people feel about that, because I can make my own decisions.\u201d\n\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon is released today.
