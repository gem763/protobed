Absolutely,\" Mulvaney said of a conversation he had Trump. \"No question about that. But that's it, and that's why we held up the money.\"\n\nHe added: \"The look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation.\"\n\nMore than five hours after the briefing, the White House issued a statement attributed to Mulvaney in which he sought to walk back his earlier comments.\n\n\"Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\" the statement said. \"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\n\n\"Multiple times during the more-than 30 minute briefing where I took over 25 questions, I referred to President Trump\u2019s interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and appropriately. There was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server \u2014 this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server.\n\n\"There never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\"\n\nThe explosive remarks from the West Wing's senior staffer before reporters seemed to provoke alarm among congressional lawmakers and Trump's allies in equal measure.\n\n\"I'm starting to get worried for POTUS now,\" a person close to the Trump campaign said in a text message of Mulvaney's performance. \"Total disaster unless there's some strategy I'm not seeing.\"\n\n\"I thought it was really remarkable,\" said one former White House official, \"because it was either a huge unforced error or a calculated concession.\"\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the leaders of the Democratic impeachment proceedings, also offered a dour assessment.\n\n\"I think Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\" Schiff said.\n\nPressed during the news conference on whether he was describing a quid pro quo with Ukraine, Mulvaney responded that \"we do that all the time with foreign policy,\" and cited the holding back of financial assistance to Northern Triangle countries to affect their immigration policies.\n\n\"I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,\" he said. \"That is going to happen. Elections have consequences, and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\"\n\nDemocrats have aggressively accelerated their impeachment inquiry since it was revealed that Trump urged newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to review two unsubstantiated charges: that Ukraine was somehow involved in wrongdoing involving Hillary Clinton's emails, and that Joe Biden led efforts to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to protect his son's interests in the region.\n\nAlthough Mulvaney insisted that \"the money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden,\" Trump raised both allegations during his call with Zelensky.\n\nMulvaney also pushed back Wednesday against a question regarding a whistleblower complaint that details alleged attempts by White House officials to \"lock down\" records of that conversation. He instead pointed to the release of a readout of the call between the two leaders \u2014 which came only after intense pressure from Congress.", "description": "Donald Trump's top aide on Thursday acknowledged that the administration held up military funds to Ukraine over the president's desire for a political probe, undermining past denials of any quid pro quo and blowing up weeks of White House messaging amid an escalating impeachment inquiry.
