To improve the fans\u2019 experience at the game:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cWe actually had a conversation with him about first pitches,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cHis view was that in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible, he would arrive at Game 5 sometime after the game began so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with fans getting into the stadium. \u201cQuite frankly, we were very grateful for that. We thought it was a great decision on the President\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nManfred\u2019s comments refer to the fans\u2019 ability to get into Nationals Park before the game, which would hindered significantly by a presidential motorcade and the Secret Service likely having to shut down an area of the stadium for Trump to enter.\n\nOf course, there is also the elephant in the room of Trump\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives and his low approval in D.C., Maryland and Virginia. You\u2019d think being likely to be booed by a significant portion of fans at the game would play a significant factor in the president\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nDonald Trump will be on hand for Game 5 of the World Series, but not in view.

The Nationals announced the plan earlier Friday.\n\nI\u2019m humbled by the invitation, and I realize is a big big big honor but I really hope that by Saturday night all of WASHINGTON will be celebrating that the @Nationals are the 2019 @MLB World Series Champions...\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\u26be\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6 https://t.co/V6EvP9L7Lr \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) October 25, 2019\n\nAndres is quite the choice for first pitch at the game Trump is attending given that the chef has been publicly outspoken against the Trump Administration on a number of topics, particularly its treatment of immigrants.\n\nThe chef made headlines in 2015 when he withdrew from his contract to open a restaurant at the Trump International Hotel in D.C. due to the president\u2019s rhetoric against Mexican immigrants. The Trump Organization sued Andr\u00e9s, Andr\u00e9s sued them back, then the two settled in 2017 after a two-year legal battle.\n\nAlso throwing first pitches at the World Series are the team\u2019s 2005 ninth inning batter of ex-closer Chad Cordero and catcher Brian Schneider for Friday\u2019s Game 3 and a player from the team\u2019s youth baseball academy for Saturday\u2019s Game 4. The youth will be accompanied by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Celebrity chef Jose Andres, a vocal critic of Trump's administration, will throw out the first pitch at Game 5 instead if the Astros force one.", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IkEdYSK7CDJdSYk3tt5uLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JIbi9a4FdYf70k7fSSCRdQ--~B/aD0yNzE4O3c9NDA4MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/36b75ba0-72a4-11e9-9bfd-7c7ca52140e6", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
