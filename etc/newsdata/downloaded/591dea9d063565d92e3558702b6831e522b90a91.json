Mitchell ended up in prison. It\u2019s all unraveling.\u201d\n\nWhat could one document hold to generate so much huff?\n\nIn short, the complaint is a record of a months-long attempt by Trump to extract from Ukraine two silver bullets, one that would \u201cprove\u201d his opponents cheated in the last election, and one that would win him the next election.\n\nIf that seems like a lot to hope for from Ukraine \u2013 if the plan seems a bit implausible, wild even \u2013 no one, of any political stripe, can be heard at the moment to be saying that it was a good plan.\n\nBut the complaint indicates with damning detail that that was indeed the plan; that Trump went a long way toward carrying it out; that he was helped in his scheme by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as by lawyers and officials in the White House and apparently in the departments of justice and state allegedly including Barr; and that the Ukrainians had begun to try to understand what silver bullets Trump wanted and where they could get them, so as not to risk missing out on US aid worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Barr has denied involvement. Speaking on Fox News, Giuliani has enthusiastically detailed his involvement, but said he was working at the behest of the state department, which the state department has denied.\n\nWhat appears to have so alarmed career government ethics and oversight officials, however, is the extent to which the now released complaint reveals that Trump\u2019s ethical rot, as they perceive it, has spread beyond the Oval Office, beyond the White House, beyond the cabinet and through the government.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A section of the whistleblower document.

The complaint indicates that that same arrangement is still in effect, only now the deals have to do with Trump\u2019s political enemies, and the safe is the one they usually use to keep records for things like flying five helicopters into Pakistan at midnight.\n\nThe overriding sense is there were a lot of people involved in a scheme by the president to both tamper in an upcoming election and to prosecute political opponents, with the help of a foreign government, secured in part by holding up hundreds of millions of dollars in aid previously appropriated by Congress.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint says it is based on the account of \u201cmore than half a dozen US officials\u201d. In accurately describing the contents of a 25 July phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president \u2013 though the whistleblower was not on the call \u2013 the complaint says \u201capproximately a dozen White House officials\u201d and at least one state department official listened to the call. After that, \u201cmultiple\u201d state department and intelligence officials were briefed on the call, the complaint says.\n\nThe complaint indicates knowledge of guilt on the part of officials involved, describing a \u201c\u2018discussion ongoing\u2019 with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain\u201d.\n\nThat knowledge of guilt appears to have endured for months. According to the complaint, seven months before the July phone call, Giuliani met in New York with a Ukrainian prosecutor who later made public statements propping up both a conspiracy theory threatening to Joe Biden and a conspiracy theory accusing Democrats of collaborating with Ukraine to throw the 2016 election.\n\nThose were the two silver bullets Trump was after, as made plain in a summary of the July call released on Wednesday.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, was valuable, and Trump leaned on the new Ukrainian president to hold him over, the complaint alleges. Trump brought up the prosecutor in the July phone conversation, according to the summary, and received assurances from the Ukrainian president that he would put the right man on the job.\n\nIt appears, then, that Trump made an effort to sow corruption in the Ukrainian government, by pressuring the president to appoint a prosecutor general preferred by Trump for that prosecutor\u2019s willingness to hunt for Trump\u2019s silver bullets or maybe to make some.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump and William Barr at the White House in Washington on 9 September 2019.

Now his name will forever be associated with the worst degradations of the Department.\u201d\n\nReasonable people concerned about how far Trump\u2019s rot has spread have been waiting for a document that would tear away the tiles and reveal all the termites \u2013 tax returns, or emails, or special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nNot one has, until, possibly, the nine-page document released on Thursday, which among other things demonstrated that however far the decay has gone, there are unnamed officials working in the US government who still remain untouched.", "description": "Report indicates there were a lot of people involved in Trump\u2019s scheme to tamper in the 2020 election and prosecute opponents", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy", "Corey Brettschneider"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d396449f160b5a7465a2824814f7899430a88ce9/0_30_4383_2630/master/4383.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc0cab68fa7f5a99b11e338e9254ac53", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
