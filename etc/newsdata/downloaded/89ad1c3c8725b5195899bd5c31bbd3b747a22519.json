The climate package includes extra spending and tax subsidies totalling 54 billion euros between 2020 and 2023. The package, revealed ahead of a climate summit in New York this week, aims to show a commitment to greener policies while also offering a boost to a flagging German economy.\n\nDespite the headline-grabbing figure, Berlin is already being criticized for not being ambitious enough.\n\n\"It's a really small package,\" Silke Kruger, co-head of investment banking at Berenberg, told CNBC Monday.\n\n\"The amount, 54 billion, sounds not too small but it's over many, many years,\" Kr\u00fcger told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche.\n\nThe government funding is set to be allocated from next year until 2023, rising from 9 billion euros in 2020 to 16.5 billion euros in its last year. Furthermore, it is budget neutral \u2014 meaning the German government has said it won't take on new debt to implement the climate package.\n\n\"On the short term, I think this won't change too much. Middle-to-long-term, it could be quite impactful and could help us as well,\" Kruger added.", "description": "Germany's 54 billion euro ($59 billion) plan to reduce carbon emissions is too small to make a difference, an analyst told CNBC Monday.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106143706-1569238052172gettyimages-1175972934.jpeg?v=1569238095", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
