Cars, clothes, classrooms\n\nThe changes in vehicles, clothing and tuition prices emerged as the trickiest trends to pinpoint.\n\n\"Players were way off when it came to tuition, but at least the estimates were in the correct, upward direction,\" said Ballou.\n\nNot sure what inflation even is?\n\nClick here for the Cost of Living primer on the subject.\n\nThe game is not an official poll. Conclusions drawn from respondents have not been weighted by geography, age, or any other factor to reflect the population or demographic composition of Canada.\n\nSo what were the results?\n\nTo visualize the results, a sample of 200 responses were randomly selected to avoid overwhelming the graphs with thousands of lines.\n\nThis graph shows a selection of Canadians' guesses on how much the cost of vehicles went up from 1998 to 2018, according to Statistics Canada.
