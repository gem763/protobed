Oh, and then receiving more than $30,000 to have professionals help you fine-tune and publish it.\n\nFor four middle schoolers, that\u2019s what happened, thanks to Girls Make Games, a summer camp and workshop series designed to inspire the next generation of women in the gaming industry. The organization was started by Laila Shabir and Ish Syed, founders of LearnDistrict, a company that creates educational video games, and has helped a number of young women and nonbinary young people publish real games.\n\n\"The video games industry is one of the biggest content creators that influences society, and especially our youth (nine out 10 US kids play games). When women don't make games, their perspective and contribution is left out of this incredible vehicle for social change,\" Shabir and Ish Syed write on their website.\n\nFor Crystal Nelson, Gracie Clauson, Isadora Tiffe and Keira Munko \u2014 collectively known as Team Sarcastic Shark \u2014 the summer program opened up their eyes to possibilities of careers in a largely male-dominated industry. The group is being honored as Groundbreakers as part of TODAY's celebration for International Day of the Girl.\n\nIn 2018, the group got together to create a game called \u201cShredded Secrets.\u201d It follows a student being bullied as well the bully himself (who\u2019s secretly struggling with his sexual identity) and a teacher dealing with personal issues of her own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about more than what\u2019s wrong with bullying. There\u2019s two aspects of bullying,\u201d Clauson told TODAY. \u201cThe first character you unlock is your main character, Isabella, she\u2019s the one who\u2019s being bullied. Once you get through the levels, you unlock the character of the bully.\u201d\n\nTheir game shows a sensitivity and social awareness typical of their generation defined by increased activism around a range of social issues like climate change and gun violence.", "description": "For International Day of the Girl, TODAY highlights 4 video game lovers from Girls Make Games who created a powerful anti-bullying game.", "authors": ["Marguerite Ward"], "top_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_40/1488226/groundbreakers-gwg-today-main-191001_ed56596bcbe74afee5e37a669891cc9e.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
