And people love watching people being rude to politicians.\u2019\n\nIn response to the report, Labour MP Diane Abbott tweeted: \u2018This is racism. And it is completely shameful. Especially when it comes from someone running to be the mayor of our diverse and multicultural capital city.\u2019\n\nFellow party member and MP David Lammy also tweeted to suggest Mr Stewart was \u2018compounding stereotypes\u2019.\n\nBut one of the men in the clip laid out his account of the exchange on Twitter, revealing the trio to be Jessy Rose, Tony Konstone and Lilo Blues of Dublin hip-hop outfit Hare Squead.\n\nDescribing Stewart as \u2018some corny-looking opportunistic goof\u2019, Mr Blues accused the former cabinet minister of singling them out to make \u2018good content\u2019.\n\nThe \u2018fake gang signs\u2019 the trio made to the camera were clearly for \u2018banter\u2019, he added.\n\nHare Squead member Lilo Blues relayed his side of the encounter on Twitter\n\nIn a statement to TheJournal.ie, Hare Squead added: \u2018He\u2019s trying to be the mayor of one of the most culturally rich and ethnically diverse cities in the world, and yet to him we\u2019re just props for his content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We walked away from him, not just because we aren\u2019t actively engaged in politics, but also because we knew he was just trying to use us.\u2019\n\n\u2018For him to turn around now and call us \u201cminor gangsters\u201d just adds insult to injury, and definitely comes from a racist place. We\u2019ve always made positive music, mostly love songs.\u2019\n\nApologising over Twitter Stewart said: \u2018I hope anyone who has watched the video will understand I was describing a light-hearted encounter in which some men were \u2013 completely understandably- gently mocking me.\n\n\u2018I was trying to describe the incident to an audience that hadn\u2019t seen the video in order to poke fun at myself as a politician in an awkward encounter.\n\n\u2018I am really sorry for causing offence. Thank you also to @DavidLammy for raising this too. I am really sorry.\u2019\n\nRory Stewart quit to stand for London Mayor, and will campaign against Tory candidate Shaun Bailey, pictured right (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nAsked whether he was sorry for stereotyping the men or merely that his comments caused offence, he added: \u2018I am very sorry towards the guys and towards everyone else. I was wrong.\u2019\n\nStewart was an outsider in the Conservative leadership race but boosted his profile with a series of pop-up events and walks to meet ordinary voters, some of which were filmed and posted on social media.\n\nHe was one of 21 Tory MPs kicked out of the party after supporting legislation aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
