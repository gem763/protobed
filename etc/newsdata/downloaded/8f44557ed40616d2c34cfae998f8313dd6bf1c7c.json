The perennial issue for Deignan has been how many of her teammates will stay in the front long enough to support her when it really counts \u2013 that may change on Saturday given the constant progress of the former national champion Hannah Barnes \u2013 but behind Vos and Van der Breggen the Dutch have immense strength in depth with the top time triallist Annemiek van Vleuten, the 2017 world road champion Chantal Blaak, as well as Amy Pieters, one of the winning mixed relay team on Sunday. Their problem is how to avoid a situation where their riders end up cancelling each other out.\n\nThere are good sporting and cultural reasons for this dominance. Having refused to host the second women\u2019s world championships in 1959, the Dutch got firmly behind women\u2019s cycle racing during the 1960s, with a well-supported national team and well-funded race calendar.\n\nThat in turn fed into the nation\u2019s support for cycling in everyday life to work and school, and produced the multiple champion Katie Hage in the 60s and 70s, and the double world and Olympic champion Leontien van Moorsel in the 90s.\n\nThe philosophy of \u201ctotal cycling\u201d \u2013 multiple leaders capable of winning \u2013 is a Dutch concept, pioneered by Peter Post at the TI-Raleigh men\u2019s professional team in the 1970s, but it is one that does not always work out for the national women\u2019s team in major championships. One example came in the European road race championship last year in Glasgow, when Van der Breggen broke away in the final phase of the race only for her own teammates to give chase behind. The plan was apparently to work for Vos in the final sprint, only for that to go awry, with Marta Bastianelli of Italy snatching the win.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lizzie Deignan will be looking to win her second world road race championship, the first having come in 2015.

For me, it\u2019s clear. It\u2019s no difficult from in my normal [trade] team, you always need to work together. You know how it works. We know the game plan before the race. If you don\u2019t work together you won\u2019t win a world championship or any road race.\u201d\n\nThe Dutchwoman pointed out the situation within the national team is remarkably similar to the way her trade team, Boels-Dolman, works. In one sense, the dominant team at women\u2019s world championships in recent years has been Boels, who have taken the title for the last four years with Deignan, Amalie Diederiksen, Blaak and Van der Breggen.\n\nTeam tactics will be vital, believes Van der Breggen, given the toughness of the course. The women\u2019s race is the longest ever at just shy of 100 miles \u2013 including a long neutral section \u2013 and heads over the climbs of Norwood Edge and Lofthouse after the start in Bradford, even before it hits its three laps of the Harrogate finishing circuit. Only two other teams have the strength in depth to concern the Dutch, the US squad with Coryn Rivera and Tuesday\u2019s time trial champion Chloe Dygert Owen, and the Italians with Bastianelli and Elisa Longo-Borghini.\n\n\u201cIt will be a day of pain,\u201d said Van der Breggen. \u201cThere are lots of metres of climbing and the roads here are so hard, always up-down, left-right. It\u2019s never the kind of road where you can relax for any length of time. You will have to be at the front all day, with those early climbs.\u201d For the Dutch, it will be another day attempting to control yet another major title race, but Van der Breggen knows the score. \u201cSometimes you need to take, sometimes you need to give.\u201d", "description": "The British rider will be on familiar ground at the finish line in Harrogate on Saturday yet the strong contingent from the Netherlands could deny her a second world title", "authors": ["William Fotheringham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0f35e795bf82ac2606d41bb67704210b39e233a/0_139_4720_2833/master/4720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e596af653eaab38587bd33d3deb910c1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
