In reality, it offers one new feature that\u2019s radically different and others that reveal how useful they are the more you get to know them.\n\nApple announced its new smart timepiece, called Apple Watch Series 5, alongside the new iPhone 11 in Cupertino, California. It looks exactly the same as before, yet somehow entirely different.\n\nThe design itself hasn\u2019t changed from last year. That\u2019s no surprise because 2018\u2019s Apple Watch Series 4 was a radical departure from all the Watches that had gone before, with its bigger display in a nearly identical case, for instance.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Series 5, then, is a dead ringer for Series 4. Except for the couple of things that make it appear very different different.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the case. Last year, you could choose between aluminium and stainless-steel finishes cladding the watch. The aluminium came in several colours, including rose gold, while the stainless steel came in the natural silvery colour you\u2019d expect, plus Space Black and Gold.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than \u2013 and a little more expensive \u2013 than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.\n\nThen there\u2019s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it\u2019s so shiny.\n\nBut the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That\u2019s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.\n\nUnlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you\u2019re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.\n\nNow, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.\n\nSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it\u2019s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.\n\nThis sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I\u2019ve found it to be a real game-changer.\n\nIt takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you\u2019re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It\u2019s very cleverly crafted so it\u2019s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state; raise your arm and it\u2019s back to full brightness and full-on design.\n\nIt\u2019s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.\n\nThere are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.\n\nThe other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it\u2019s actually plenty useful. That\u2019s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you\u2019re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don\u2019t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.\n\nIt\u2019s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.\n\nMuch of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn\u2019t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.\n\nThere are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you\u2019re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.\n\nThe Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.\n\nA word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at \u00a3199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don\u2019t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it\u2019s a great first Apple Watch.\n\nThe Series 5 Watch starts at \u00a3399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or \u00a3429 for the larger, 44mm case. Add \u00a3100 if you want cellular connectivity so you can make phone calls even when your iPhone is at home.\n\nOne other thing worth mentioning: Apple is all about personalisation this year. Not only are there more case options than ever before \u2013 I didn\u2019t even mention the special editions with Nike and Herm\u00e8s \u2013 but it\u2019s now possible to mix and match the Watch and band you prefer with much greater choice.\n\nThe always-on feature is the marquee upgrade on this Watch and it\u2019s tremendous. It doesn\u2019t affect battery life, that\u2019s still well over a day. Until last week, Series 4 was the best smartwatch on the market by a country mile. Series 5 puts Apple further ahead of its rivals.", "description": "At first glance, the new Apple Watch seems to be the gentlest of upgrades.
