But it was our last day in Italy so we told ourselves it was OK. It's around 2 kg of fish so I agreed to pay around \u20ac130-150 for this dish of fish. We don't want to have more drama in Italy.\"\n\nBut when one of her friends asked for the bill, he was asked to pay for 4.8 kg of mixed fish at a cost of \u20ac315, Minh said.\n\nAdding \u20ac40 of service fee and \u20ac40 for the tip, the whole bill was a staggering \u20ac476.40.\n\nTourist complaints over rip-off Rome restaurant mount after viral $500 bill Minh Ngoc Bui\n\n\"He complained that this could not be this much and he doesn't agree to pay this much for the service and tip, they did not announce clearly about this rule on the menu. But they told him that the service and tip were the rules and we really ate that much,\" the woman said. \"He tried to complain but they forced him to pay. So he paid by himself.\"\n\nWhen Minh later found out about the bill, she suggested to her friend that they return to the restaurant to complain.\n\n\"When we returned, I asked the man who served us to put 4.8 kg of mixed seafood on that plate. Because I firmly believe that it is impossible and they cannot do it. And just like I thought, they couldn't do it and refused to do it with the excuse that they didn't have time,\" she said.\n\nRelated content These European destinations will charge you the most to visit\n\nThey tried to report the restaurant to police, but authorities told them they should have called before the payment, Minh said.\n\nCNN has contacted the Antico Caff\u00e8 di Marte restaurant for comment.\n\nFollowing the backlash, Tripadvisor suspended the restaurant's review page with this statement: \"Due to a recent event that has attracted media attention and has caused an influx of review submissions that do not describe a firsthand experience, we have temporarily suspended publishing new reviews for this listing. If you've had a firsthand experience at this property, please check back soon -- we're looking forward to receiving your review!\"\n\nAntico Caff\u00e8 di Marte replied to the criticism triggered by the Japanese tourists' bill by saying that the menu \"is clear,\" according to a statement published by the Italian newspaper Il Messaggero\n\n\"Everything is written in detail, just look at the prices: \u20ac16 maximum for a spaghetti with seafood,\" Giacomo Jin, the owner, said, according to the paper. \"To pay that figure, the [Japanese] girls ordered not only spaghetti, but also fish. On the other hand, our fish is fresh: the client picks it at the counter, we weigh it and we cook it.\"", "description": "A Rome restaurant, Antico Caff\u00e8 di Marte, has attracted a wave of complaints over the alleged overcharging of tourists after two Japanese diners claimed they had been slapped with a bill for \u20ac430 ($470) for two plates of spaghetti and fish, and water.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191001144504-03-rome-restaurant-tourist-bill-super-tease.jpg"}
