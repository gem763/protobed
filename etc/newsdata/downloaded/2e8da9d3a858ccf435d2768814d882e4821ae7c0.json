This is what 48 members of Congress and 15 state attorneys general argued in their recent amicus brief to the court, claiming that the concepts of \u201csex,\u201d \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d \u201chad different meanings\u201d when the law was passed in 1964, and warning the court not to \u201cerroneously \u2026 broaden Title VII beyond its congressionally intended scope.\u201d\n\nBut Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination has always been ambiguous and flexible. Women and LGBTQ people have long demanded, and government officials have often affirmed, definitions of protected sex equality that encompass a range of identity-based concerns that are far broader than treating men and women interchangeably at work. A ruling against LGBTQ workers, not one in their favor, would represent the real distortion of Title VII\u2019s history and historical meaning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe ambiguity in Title VII took root even before the Civil Rights Act became law. Its drafters designed the provision to attack racism at work. This was a problem the mainstream civil rights movement defined, and most lawmakers understood, as a matter of stigma and stereotype. Its solution, they argued, was to decenter race as a relevant characteristic in determining who got jobs and promotions, and how workers were treated.\n\nThe framers of the Civil Rights Act did not initially even intend for gender to be part of the provision. At the time, each state had its own combination of \u201cprotective\u201d labor laws that regulated women\u2019s working hours, conditions and pay \u2014 meant, in theory, to safeguard their best interests. Women\u2019s advocates and labor unions hotly debated whether a federal law that wiped out these protections would ultimately benefit women.\n\nMany activists, in fact, balked when Rep. Howard Smith, a conservative Virginia Democrat, convinced his fellow lawmakers to add sex to Title VII at the 11th hour, without hearings or debate over its meaning, likely because he hoped this maneuver could kill the act entirely and protect segregation. To his surprise, and that of many others, the law passed with the new provision included.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a new federal agency created to police Title VII, therefore got very little guidance on how to interpret the sex provision, which had been \u201ctacked on rather suddenly,\u201d grumbled EEOC Chairman Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. Other EEOC officials publicly mocked the sex provision as \u201ca fluke\u201d that had been \u201cconceived out of wedlock\u201d and mused that enforcing the sex discrimination ban could mean requiring the Playboy Club to hire hairy-legged male bunnies.\n\nWhile federal officials joked about the provision, workers took it seriously. They flooded the EEOC with 4,000 sex discrimination complaints within the first two years alone \u2014 complaints that revealed workers\u2019 own expansive interpretations of the law. In free-form letters, they demanded that Title VII encompass more autonomy at work, better hours and pay, bodily autonomy and financial security. As Massachusetts factory worker Thelma Pilch wrote to the EEOC in 1966, claiming that her capricious boss, physically taxing work and unsanitary working conditions were all matters that Title VII should address, \u201cWe have no union but we do have some rights don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nBefore the EEOC streamlined its processes and reporting forms in the early 1970s, bureaucrats investigated these kinds of self-fashioned claims as issues that Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination could address. It was the agency\u2019s mounting backlog of cases \u2014 which topped 81,000 by 1968 \u2014 more than any consensus definition of sex discrimination that sharpened the agency\u2019s criteria for investigating these complaints.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWorkers continued to project their aspirations for fair treatment onto Title VII. The provision was open to so many different interpretations because sex itself could be defined in many ways: as a matter of innate biology, of sexual desire and of rigid sex roles. When aspiring flight attendant Celio Diaz used Title VII to sue Pan American World Airways in 1967 because the company limited the job to women, the company defended the practice by appealing to societal suspicion of effeminate and gay men. The airline called as an expert witness a psychiatrist who claimed that male flight attendants would unsettle the average male passenger by \u201carous[ing] feelings in him he would rather not have aroused.\u201d\n\nBut Diaz won, with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that femininity and masculinity can only be explicit job attributes in rare cases. The Supreme Court has since affirmed this principle, holding in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989) and Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998) that discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes \u2014 that is, punishing masculine women or effeminate men \u2014 is unlawful sex discrimination, as is same-sex sexual harassment.\n\nActivists have also demanded, and courts have often accepted, sex-based Title VII claims that recognized how race and class shaped sex and gender discrimination. In 1994, in Lam v. University of Hawaii, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opined that Asian women experienced \u201cdisadvantages that are not shared by Asian men or white women,\u201d and thus courts must determine whether an employer discriminates \u201con the basis of that combination of factors, not just whether it discriminates against people of the same race or of the same sex.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd for a time in the 1970s and early 1980s, courts even affirmed the theory of comparable worth, which argued that only sexist stereotypes and historic discrimination could explain why jobs requiring equal skill were paid differently. As a Madison, Wis. nurse testified in a suit against the city, nurses should not \u201cfeel they should have to become carpenters or plumbers to be paid equitably.\u201d In a different case, a federal judge ordered the state of Washington to lay the groundwork to give comparable worth raises to women throughout the state\u2019s labor force. Other states soon followed suit. Only when conservatives appointed by President Ronald Reagan took over federal agencies and judgeships in the mid-1980s did lawmakers decide that remaking employers\u2019 pay practices in the name of sex equality should be beyond Title VII\u2019s scope.\n\nBut the pattern is clear: while some of these claims lost in court or saw more conservative bureaucrats short-circuit them, Title VII\u2019s meaning has not been limited to cisgender or heterosexual plaintiffs. Instead, dating back to its origins, Title VII\u2019s essence has been hotly contested, with workers and activists seizing upon the ambiguities to demand and win a range of protections that respect how sex discrimination means different things to differently-situated workers.\n\nThis history demonstrates that the court could easily interpret the provision to protect LGBTQ Americans without distorting the intent of Congress. The provision itself is vague, and its history is one of constant change that has enabled Title VII to fit our ever shifting understanding of sex discrimination. It would be far more troubling for the court to suddenly constrict its interpretation of the provision, which would introduce dramatic new limits to the meaning of sex equality with devastating effect.\n\nAD", "description": "It shouldn't be legal to fire somebody for their sexual orientation or gender identity.", "authors": ["Katherine Turk", "Katherine Turk Is Associate Professor Of History At The University Of North Carolina At Chapel Hill", "The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DsDS5ByuqvInwb1EAsmJUiCFmEc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ETIH2AHJEII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
