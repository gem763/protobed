Those many years ago, I spent days performing repetitive tasks just to earn a special mount, and after that, I swore off grinding reputation for rewards. Then Blizzard announced the Vulpera, a new playable allied race available in the next major game update for players who\u2019ve reached the highest reputation level with Battle for Azeroth\u2019s Voldunai faction. They look like little foxes and they hang out with alpaca. Here I go again.\n\nThe last time I harvested good graces with World of Warcraft\u2019s virtual races was in 2007. I decided I needed a riding talbuk, a weird goat horse creature native to The Burning Crusade expansion\u2019s Nagrand region. To get it, I had to reach exalted reputation (the highest level) with the Kurenai, a tribe of Draenei dwelling in the region. I spent days killing cult members and ogres, turning in special beads that incrementally increased my standing with the tribe, until finally the talbuk was mine.\n\nThough I enjoyed the reward, I hated everything else about the faction grind. There are better ways to spend my time than scraping together faction points in order to earn some virtual prize. So, after that, I stopped. I never put in the effort to earn another faction mount. When Blizzard introduced quests to unlock flying in new expansions, which involve earning a certain level of reputation with an assortment of factions, I passed on it. I still can\u2019t fly in zones from the previous expansion, Legion, and the chances of me flying in Battle for Azeroth are slim.\n\nBut dammit, there\u2019s just something about these stupid little foxes. I need to be one. They are adorable. They are ridiculous. They are so\u2026 me. And so I\u2019ve found myself logging into World of Warcraft every single day since the announcement. The timing of my decision has also been both guilt-inducing and incredibly awkward, considering that the day after the announcement of this new playable race, Blizzard suspended competitive Hearthstone player Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai for supporting Hong Kong during a stream, causing a cascade of ill will towards the developer.\n\nAs Cecilia D\u2019Anastasio pointed out, it\u2019s a tense time to be playing and writing about Blizzard games, to the point where I\u2019ve been hesitant to say anything about my current obsession.\n\nBut I am obsessing, and pretty hard. I never knew I had the option to show faction progress as an experience bar on the bottom of my screen. Now I log in every day to scour the Vol\u2019Dun region for special world quests that offer extra points towards the Voldunai reputation. I send my followers off on missions for Voldunai rewards. I obtained a special item that grants me 10 points of Voldunai reputation every time I complete any faction\u2019s world quests.\n\nI am currently at 5,310 points of the 21,000 required to reach exalted. I\u2019m lucky if I manage to accrue 1,000 points a day. That means I\u2019m still about 15 days away from reaching my goal. Here I am, planning out more than two weeks of gameplay during the busy fall season in a game from a developer lots of people are unhappy with right now, and for what?\n\nOh yeah. Be right back.
