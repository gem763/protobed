Well, try and banish the picture, if that is possible, but consider instead the sound. An unholy conjugation of machine and animal from which Formula One would surely like to keep its distance.\n\nThis description of the sound of F1 cars is not the aural sculpture the sport wants associated with its expansion in North America. Yet said development, in the form of this week\u2019s announcement of an agreement in principle to host a race in Miami, may yet see the delightfully colourful phrase bandied around for a while longer.\n\nMercedes flex muscles in Japan to leave rivals in the rear-view mirror Read more\n\nSince taking over the sport in 2017 the owners, Liberty Media, have sought to add to the lone USGP in Texas. Their original plan to put on a race in Miami was stymied earlier this year by objections over its impact on business, traffic and residents at the proposed bayfront site in downtown.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday Sean Bratches, F1\u2019s commercial director,and the CEO of the Miami Dolphins, Tom Garfinkel, issued a joint statement covering the new plan to host a race in the Miami Gardens district, near the Dolphins\u2019 Hard Rock stadium.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to announce that Formula One and Hard Rock Stadium have reached an agreement in principle to host the first-ever Formula One Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium,\u201d it read. \u201cWith an estimated annual impact of more than $400m and 35,000 room nights, the Formula One Miami Grand Prix will be an economic juggernaut for South Florida each and every year.\u201d\n\nThe project, aimed for the calendar in 2021, has been backed by the Dolphins\u2019 franchise and stadium owner, Steve Ross. He is expected to cover costs, including an estimated $40m to build the circuit and its immediate infrastructure.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The latest plan is for an F1 race in the streets around Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins NFL team.

It is far from the glamour of the bayfront but requires fewer grants of approval from public bodies. It does, however, include a stretch of public road to the south of the stadium on Northwest 199th street. Which is one reason this is not yet a done deal.\n\nIn September residents appraised of the proposal immediately expressed concern. The Miami Herald reported that homeowners commissioned a report on the impact of the race. The acoustics expert Colby Leider who compiled it warned that the noise would reach over 120 decibels, compared it to a jet plane taking off and \u2013 bravo Colby, for your critique of the modern F1 sound \u2013 cited the quote, originally made in an article from thedrive.com, that goats and vacuum cleaners would be getting it on. En masse.\n\nF1: Miami Grand Prix postponed until 2020 to avoid \u2018sub-optimal\u2019 street course Read more\n\nPublic pressure put paid to F1\u2019s first shot at Miami and it has not gone away. The race still requires the approval of the Miami-Dade County Commission. County Commissioner Barbara Jordan opposes hosting it at the stadium and, having met residents, has not changed her opinion.\n\n\u201cIt solidified my position as a no, in terms of something this community does not want,\u201d she said. The Herald reports that the Miami Gardens Mayor, Oliver Gilbert, also opposes the race.\n\nMembers of the community were out on Sunday protesting on 199th street. Leading the activists was the former Miami-Dade Commissioner Betty T Ferguson, who made her point to 7 News Miami. \u201cEven more people will be affected negatively by a race like this than even in the downtown area,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re talking about a stadium that is surrounded on all four sides by bedroom communities.\u201d It would, she added, be \u201cenvironmentally devastating\u201d.\n\nRegardless, Garfinkel remains optimistic. \u201cImagine people coming to this region from around the World in May,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMultiple passing zones and world-class clubs and amenities. Barcelona, Monaco \u2026 Miami \u2026 make it happen.\u201d\n\nWhich raised another potential corollary of making it happen. With 22 races next season, Miami would make 23 in 2021, pushing to the limit teams already loth to add meetings. F1\u2019s sporting director, Ross Brawn, said this week it was looking at reorganising race weekends so teams and drivers can arrive a day later, specifically because of the increase in meetings. Which may work or there may still be some pushback and it would be Barcelona \u2013 a race in May and only on a contract until 2020 \u2013 that may find itself under threat.\n\nSome business leaders, especially in hospitality and tourism, are understandably bullish about the advantages of hosting in Miami with the grand prix being likened to hosting a Super Bowl every year. Which is a comparison no doubt not being made by accident. F1 has already described how it wants its races at \u201cdestination cities\u201d to represent Super Bowl-style events.\n\nWhether it finally achieves that in Miami lies first in the hands of the county commissioners. Another rejection would be a severe blow for Liberty Media, their juggernaut derailed by the threat of noisy humping.", "description": "Plan announced this week to host race in Florida city faces opposition from some local people due to its impact and noise", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d236afd665208ad16fd1777580142456b1b1358d/0_40_1028_617/master/1028.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fd3f7c56ad72163e008b0c1bc8d47ead", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
