The Washington Times takes a weekly look at some of them that may have flown under the radar.\n\nSen. Cory Booker on Thursday released a plan intended to bolster the rights of college athletes and move toward pay and gender equity in sports, including for the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team.\n\nUnder Mr. Booker\u2019s plan, college athletes could get paid for \u201cname, image and likeness\u201d rights, a priority modeled on legislation that recently passed in California.\n\n\u201cSports at these levels is a multi-billion dollar business,\u201d said Mr. Booker, a former college football player at Stanford University. \u201cJust as we shouldn\u2019t accept collusion, wage theft and a massive gender pay gap in any other industry, we shouldn\u2019t accept them in sports.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker also wants to establish a new federal commission on \u201cIntegrity in Sports\u201d that would provide additional oversight over college athletics and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee.\n\nThe commission would be charged with making recommendations on issues such as health and safety standards, access to health care, and whether athletes should be able to form labor unions.\n\nMr. Booker also wants to bolster health and safety standards for college athletes, help current and former college athletes pay their medical bills, and make it easier for athletes to transfer schools.\n\nThe plan also includes legislation to require national governing bodies, including the U.S. Soccer Federation, to compensate female athletes \u201cfairly and equally.\u201d\n\nAnd he wants to improve pay for minor league baseball players, end \u201cexploitative\u201d labor policies for NFL cheerleaders and NBA dancers, and crack down on \u201canti-competitive\u201d labor practices, invoking former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s effective exile from the league as an example.\n\nWarren on \u2018environmental justice\u2019\n\n\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released a plan intended to deliver \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d to communities most affected by climate change, one of the key priorities for activists championing the Green New Deal being pushed by Ms. Warren and other liberals in Congress.\n\n\n\nMs. Warren wants the federal government to better map at-risk communities across the U.S. and direct at least $1 trillion to the most vulnerable areas over the next decade.\n\nShe also plans to transform the White House\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality into a broader Council on Climate Action and bring community leaders to the White House within 100 days of taking office for an \u201cenvironmental justice summit.\u201d\n\nShe also is vowing to provide job training and guarantee wage and benefit \u201cparity\u201d for fossil fuel workers transitioning to new industries, bolster work safety regulations, and empower the Environmental Protection Agency to \u201caggressively\u201d pursue cases of \u201cenvironmental discrimination\u201d and go after corporate polluters.\n\nMs. Warren also wants to hold the financial industry \u201caccountable\u201d for \u201cits role in the climate crisis\u201d and require banks and other companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and price their exposure to \u201cclimate risk\u201d into their valuations.\n\nShe re-introduced a \u201cclimate risk disclosure\u201d bill earlier this year.\n\nShe also plans to work with Congress to put more money into clean water efforts and make it easier for vulnerable residents to move out of flood-prone areas \u2014 a \u201chigher ground\u201d pitch that 2020 Democratic presidential rival Andrew Yang has made.\n\nHer campaign also said a Warren administration would better monitor post-disaster recovery to head off \u201cclimate gentrification.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe plan gives multiple shout-outs to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a former 2020 presidential candidate who made climate change the central issue of his campaign.\n\nMs. Warren is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal and has introduced other policy proposals with an eye toward climate change, including a $2 trillion plan to invest in \u201cgreen\u201d manufacturing.\n\nButtigieg on prescription drug prices\n\n\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, announced a plan Monday to cut the rising cost of prescription drugs that envisions penalizing pharmaceutical companies that don\u2019t fairly negotiate prices.\n\nMr. Buttigieg set a goal of capping out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $200 per month and keeping out-of-pocket drug costs under $250 per month for everyone who opts into a government-run health care plan under his broader health insurance vision.\n\n\u201cInstead of siding with Americans, politicians have stood with Big Pharma, as they did when Congress barred the federal government from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices for seniors,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new era of leadership in Washington who will finally make drugs affordable and take on pharmaceutical companies.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg would work to empower the federal government to bargain with private companies to lower the cost of drugs and would impose a minimum 65% tax on the company\u2019s gross sales of the drug if it doesn\u2019t participate in negotiations or if it leave the talks early.\n\nHe also would try to impose price protections by penalizing companies that increase drug prices faster than the rate of inflation and leverage intellectual property rules to get around \u201cworst offender\u201d pharmaceutical companies and find another supplier in drastic cases.\n\nSanders on money in politics\n\n\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders on Monday released a plan intended to curb the influence of money in politics that includes new rules of the road for public financing of political campaigns and an overhaul of the Federal Election Commission.\n\nMr. Sanders wants to ban corporate donations to Democratic Party conventions and inaugural events and institute a lifetime lobbying ban for former members of Congress and senior staffers.\n\n\u201cOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don\u2019t need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cWhen we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.\u201d\n\nThe plan also calls for mandatory public financing laws for all federal elections and a new system of vouchers that allows voting-age Americans to \u201cdonate\u201d to political candidates, akin to a program in Seattle and one that Mr. Yang has floated.\n\nMr. Sanders also would replace the FEC with a three-member Federal Election Administration that could impose civil and criminal penalties for campaign finance violations.\n\nHis plan takes aim at the Democratic National Committee, with whom Mr. Sanders has had a tenuous relationship dating to at least the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHe would ban national party chairmen and co-chairmen from ever serving as lobbyists or working for entities that receive federal contracts. He also would ban donations to the DNC from federal lobbyists and corporations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
