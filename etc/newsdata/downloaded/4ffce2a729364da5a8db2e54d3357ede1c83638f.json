California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, endorsed the bill this month and is expected to sign it after it goes through the State Assembly, in what is expected to be a formality. Under the measure, which would go into effect Jan. 1, workers must be designated as employees instead of contractors if a company exerts control over how they perform their tasks or if their work is part of a company\u2019s regular business.\n\nThe bill may influence other states. A coalition of labor groups is pushing similar legislation in New York, and bills in Washington State and Oregon that were similar to California\u2019s but failed to advance could see renewed momentum. New York City passed a minimum wage for ride-hailing drivers last year but did not try to classify them as employees.\n\nIn California, the legislation will affect at least one million workers who have been on the receiving end of a decades-long trend of outsourcing and franchising work, making employer-worker relationships more arm\u2019s-length. Many people have been pushed into contractor status with no access to basic protections like a minimum wage and unemployment insurance. Ride-hailing drivers, food-delivery couriers, janitors, nail salon workers, construction workers and franchise owners could now all be reclassified as employees.", "description": "With the bill\u2019s passage, California\u2019s ride-hailing drivers, food-delivery couriers, janitors and others are set to be reclassified as employees and not contractors.", "authors": ["Kate Conger", "Noam Scheiber"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/business/10gigworklaw/10gigworklaw-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
