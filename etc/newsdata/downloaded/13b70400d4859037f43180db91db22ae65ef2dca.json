Women with disabilities, care workers and migrant women whose voices have not typically been heard since the movement began as a hashtag in October 2017 will be among the participants from around the world to share their stories, and discuss how to keep up the momentum to tackle sexual abuse and assault.\n\nThe prime minister, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, told the Guardian that the conference was intended to \u201ccreate a platform for an international and in-depth conversation about the impact and the future of #MeToo\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe movement revealed epidemic levels of sexual and gender-based harassment and abuse that women across society and the world are exposed to. We owe it to all those women, to the women who couldn\u2019t speak up and to future generations, to create policies and push for transformative change, so that the realities unveiled by #MeToo will soon belong to the history books.\u201d\n\nEighty panelists are scheduled to appear, including Purna Sen, the UN\u2019s spokeswoman on addressing sexual harassment, the American political activist Angela Davis, Catherine Mayer, co-founder of the UK\u2019s Women\u2019s Equality party, the playwright Justina Kehinde and the positive masculinity campaigner Gary Barker.\n\nHalla Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, the Icelandic government\u2019s adviser on gender equality, and one of the main organisers of the conference, said #MeToo Moving Forward would analyse what it revealed about different countries, including the USA and Britain, where it has been explosive since the emergence of sexual abuse allegations against the film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he denies, as well as in the Nordic countries where it has dominated headlines.\n\nShe Said: an inside look at the story that brought down Harvey Weinstein Read more\n\nThe conference organisers hoped to produce a communique of concrete proposals \u201cif and when we come up with them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to expand the conversation, to listen to the voices we haven\u2019t yet heard, including those with more insecure employment whose status might have affected their ability to file a complaint, including women in low-skilled, low-paid professions, care workers, domestic workers, migrant workers, disabled women, who have often not been able to organise themselves in the same way that others have.\n\n\u201cWe want to look at the themes that run across these groups, including consent, justice and the backlash.\u201d\n\nThe idea for the conference started 18 months ago as \u201ca tiny idea in my head,\u201d Halla said. Invitations were sent out to a range of potential speakers with 50 originally expected to attend. \u201cBut almost everyone we asked said yes, so it\u2019s much bigger than we expected with people telling us they welcomed the possibility to discuss this, and just this, in a concentrated way over three days.\u201d\n\nMore than 800 participants have registered to attend \u2013 almost twice as many as expected. It is free of charge, and panel discussions will be livestreamed.\n\n#MeToo Moving Forward is taking place under the auspices of the Nordic Council of Ministers, the presidency of which Iceland currently holds. Women\u2019s rights have long been at the heart of the politics of Katr\u00edn, who became Iceland\u2019s second female prime minister almost two years ago. It is also core part of the Left-Green movement to which she belongs.\n\nHalla said surprise had been expressed that Iceland, like all Nordic countries often viewed as exemplary for its social welfare policies, was choosing to host the event, after the most publicised #MeToo scandals had taken place in the USA and Britain.\n\n\u201cWe felt that we\u2019re obliged to hold it. Iceland is often seen as the number one in the world, receiving constant recognition for its strong welfare system and equal rights and held up as a gender equality utopia. But we thought: \u2018If this is as good as it gets it\u2019s not good, is it?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n#MeToo had revealed many cases of systemic harassment in non-unionised jobs in Iceland, she said, and thousands of women had taken to Facebook to share their stories. \u201cWe had hoped it did not happen here, until we started talking about it and found out it did,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Sweden the focus has mainly been on the Swedish Academy, home to the Nobel prize, which was beset with sexual harassment claims involving its former head. Sex workers in Sweden have also been among those to speak out. In Norway, the #MeToo revelations have largely played out in the political world.\n\n\u201cWhat #MeToo did was to bring the conversation into every lunch-break in every office, where everyone started talking about what happened to them and sharing their stories, it suddenly opened a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d Halla said.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re still looking into what #MeToo actually is. Is it a revolution? A subversion? Just a small window of opportunity, or something bigger? What I\u2019m hoping is that this conference helps to keep the momentum going, and if there\u2019s a backlash that it helps us to challenge that backlash.\u201d", "description": "Three-day gathering is set to explore why movement first gained traction and effect it has had", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc6706ca9d2b91cb676db8d1e76d51e3db36fb5b/0_195_6140_3685/master/6140.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cd343d76d19570175c9fec3b6171d88", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
