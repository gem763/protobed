All UK banks and building societies are included in its database - to start a search, you'll have to complete an online form here .\n\nThe service aims to help consumers discover accounts that are no longer on the 'live' or 'open' part of the bank or building society's customer records and instead are being maintained as part of their record of 'lost' or 'dormant' accounts. This includes accounts belonging to the deceased - which may qualify as part of a will - or vulnerable adults that may be unaware that the accounts even exist.\n\nIf you are aware of a bank or building society holding an account then you should first approach that bank or building society direct to see whether the account is still open. Remember to take your ID and proof or address with you when you head into branch.\n\nIf it is not, you can use Mylostaccount to search for a 'dormant' or 'lost' account.\n\nTo track down Premium Bonds or lost Premium Bond prizes , you can use NS&I's Premium Bonds prize checker .\n\nBonds that were bought more than 30 years ago are unlikely to have a Premium Bond holder's number associated with them - you're likely just to have the individually-numbered bonds. If that's the case, you can write to NS&I to ask for one.\n\nWhat about pensions?\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nLost money is not just about lost savings and old banks accounts, you may also find there's money hidden away in old pensions.\n\nWhile it is always advised that you keep in touch with your pension schemes throughout your career, if you've changed jobs on a number of occasions, it's possible you may have lost track of what's locked where.\n\nThere are over 200,000 pension schemes in the UK. The government's online Pension Tracing Service helps you track down any lost money you have available elsewhere. You can use the tool to:\n\nFind contact details for your own (or previous) workplace or personal pension scheme\n\nFind contact details for someone else\u2019s scheme if you have their permission\n\nRemember if a close relative has died without taking their pension, you may be eligible for that pension fund cash too.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with someone\u2019s affairs after their death, you should check their paperwork to see if they had any personal or workplace pension schemes in place.\n\nIf they did, contact the pension provider to find out how much they had and what to do next.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know who the pension provider is and the deceased was employed, contact their employer to see if there was a workplace pension in place.\n\nThe amount you can claim and when you can claim it depends on which type of personal or workplace pension it is. The Pensions Tracer tool can help you find out this information, to make a claim or contact the pension provider, the Money Advice Service has a handy letter template you can follow.", "description": "Two fifths of savers who uncovered money admitted it was because they failed to keep track of their savings", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article7218402.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_money-savings-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
