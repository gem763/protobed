Cooper, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe New England Patriots improved to a league-best 8-0 on Sunday, giving Bill Belichick his 300th career win as a head coach (counting playoff wins).\n\nBy comparison, Don Shula collected 347 career wins (counting playoffs). If you're counting just regular-season wins, Shula holds a 328 to 269 edge.\n\nShula's wins records were once considered untouchable. However, in a few more seasons, Belichick could seriously threaten Shula's wins records.\n\nThe Patriots' win over the Browns proved not only that New England is well, New England. But also that Cleveland is the league's most disappointing team this season. Once a trendy preseason Super Bowl pick, the Browns have emerged this season as, well, the Browns.\n\nMeanwhile in San Francisco, the 49ers remained the NFL's only other unbeaten team, going to 7-0 after dropping a 50-burger on the Carolina Panthers. However, unlike the Patriots in the AFC, the 49ers appear to have legit challengers in the NFC with the New Orleans Saints (7-1), Green Bay Packers (7-1), Minnesota Vikings (6-2), Seattle Seahawks (6-2) among those contenders through Week 8.\n\nBill Belichick and Tom Brady are halfway toward their second perfect regular season.

After Sunday\u2019s game, there\u2019s no clear answer. However, second-year back Tra Carson got a much larger share than expected. He led the team in carries (12) and rushing yards (34).\n\non injured reserve last week, the big question was who would be next in line for carries. After Sunday\u2019s game, there\u2019s no clear answer. However, second-year back got a much larger share than expected. He led the team in carries (12) and rushing yards (34). The Minnesota Vikings\u2019 rushing attack has been so potent at times this season, it can support two running backs. Even backing up Dalvin Cook , rookie Alexander Mattison put up his highest combined yardage of the season in Week 8. With the Chiefs up next, he could get even more touches.\n\n, rookie put up his highest combined yardage of the season in Week 8. With the Chiefs up next, he could get even more touches. Another rookie, Raiders WR Hunter Renfrow , also had his best game of the season -- catching four passes for 88 yards and his first NFL touchdown. He could be a decent bye-week filler, especially if No. 1 WR Tyrell Williams continues to have foot issues.\n\n, also had his best game of the season -- catching four passes for 88 yards and his first NFL touchdown. He could be a decent bye-week filler, especially if No. 1 WR continues to have foot issues. With the persistent injuries plaguing Jets tight ends, Ryan Griffin has stepped up as a legitimate option in the passing game. He had Week 8\u2019s most productive fantasy day among tight ends with four catches for 66 yards and two touchdowns. Also, if Tennessee\u2019s Delanie Walker continues to be limited by injury, Jonnu Smith has shown he can produce. He caught six of seven targets for 78 yards and a score.\n\n- Fantasy football: Valuable advice to help your team dominate\n\nComing this week\n\nMonday:Week 8 wraps up with the winless Miami Dolphins playing the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field (8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN).
