He added that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, \"violated the law ... [and] the public trust.\"\n\nHowever, Furman said there\u2019s no evidence to show that the decision to add the question was unconstitutional and motivated by an intent to discriminate, as the plaintiffs alleged.\n\nThe other side: The administration, which has maintained that adding the question \u2014 which hasn't been asked on the nation's standard census form since 1950 \u2014 would provide citizenship data for the Justice Department to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut, John Gore, the acting head of the DOJ's civil rights division, said in a deposition last year that the question is \"not necessary\" to enforce the VRA.\n\nWhat's next: This legal victory, led by plaintiffs that include New York and 17 other states as well as several cities and immigrant groups, is expected to reach the Supreme Court via a swift appeal from the administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which already intervened in the case on preliminary matters, will hear oral arguments in February to determine whether Ross should explain his reasoning for adding the controversial question.\n\nThis decision also comes as other similar challenges seeking to strike down the citizenship question are playing out in California and Maryland.\n\nGo deeper: Trump goes to trial over 2020 census citizenship question", "description": "Critics argue that the inclusion of a citizenship questions would lead to an inaccurate census count.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/dfUVz2SiCnIKqz38cUc39aI9r3s=/0x0:4142x2330/1920x1080/2018/12/17/1545074238917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-15"}
