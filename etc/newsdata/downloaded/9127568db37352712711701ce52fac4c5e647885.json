The UN also said the raids broke international law because drugs workers are not considered a legitimate military target.\n\nAmerican forces in Afghanistan immediately disputed the reports findings, saying they disagreed with the UN's methods, analysis and \u201cnarrow definition\u201d of legitimate targets.\n\nA spokesman said the labs had been under lengthy surveillance before they were struck and \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d had been taken to avoid killing civilians. Col Sonny Leggett said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the UN's methods and findings.\n\nTaliban insurgents have long been accused of obtaining huge sums from the country's extensive opium trade, as militants tax production and levy protection money.
