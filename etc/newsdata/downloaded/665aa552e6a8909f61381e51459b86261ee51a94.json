Lower income customers only pay what they can afford.\n\nNow, with some modifications, the company thinks it can help people who struggle with memory loss to live at home \u2014 saving the government money it would otherwise spend on care. It's built the first customized homes just outside Stockholm.\n\nDesign tweaks include taking mirrors out of bathrooms and fitting kitchen appliances with old-fashioned knobs, rather than digital controls.\n\nThe developments also emphasize spending time outdoors, and will include \"therapeutic\" gardens and clubhouses for socializing. That could make it more appealing for a partner to move there, too.\n\n\"To take care of elderly people, that cost is exploding,\" BoKlok CEO Jonas Spangenberg told CNN Business. \"It's much cheaper for society and the public to give them service back home.\"\n\nThis rendering shows a BoKlok community designed for elderly residents.\n\n'A growing problem'\n\nFrom Japan to the United States, countries around the world are dealing with the effects of aging populations.\n\nSweden is no exception. By 2040, nearly one in four Swedes will be 65 years or older by 2040, in part because of the baby boom following World War II.\n\nIn a country like Sweden, where life expectancy is very high and most care for the elderly is government funded, that means a strain on spending and resources looms. One concern is the supply of affordable yet comfortable accommodations.\n\n\"We see a growing problem ... that [people] are ending up in institutions where they do not want to end up,\" Spangenberg said.\n\nHe continued: \"If we can crack the code where you can continue to live at a home or an apartment that is more suitable for you, even with various syndromes, we believe we could do a ... good thing for society.\"\n\nThat's the driving idea behind the company's SilviaBo project. Its namesake, Queen Silvia of Sweden \u2014 whose mother suffered from Alzheimer's \u2014 has been a partner from the beginning.\n\nBefore he died in 2018, Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad made a large donation to the project through the the queen's foundation, which provides training on dementia care. She's a member of the steering board, and has also been involved in the design process.\n\nThe Ikea model\n\nBoKlok is in the early stages of launching SilviaBo in Sweden, its first market, and is starting to talk to local governments about land and zoning. Spangenberg said he expects progress in the next year.\n\nSo far, the company has built a small pilot with six apartments just outside Stockholm. Residents have not moved in yet due to an ongoing permit dispute with neighbors, but the company maintains a legal resolution is \"on its way.\"\n\nSilviaBo apartments, as rendered here, will include special design features, such as colored elements in bathrooms and old-fashioned knobs in the kitchens.\n\nThe BoKlok approach to affordable housing has its roots in the Ikea way of thinking.\n\n\"BoKlok was designed the IKEA way: large volumes, low prices,\" according to a Skanska blog post from 2011. \"Industrialized production and large volumes \u2014 in other words, repetition \u2014 cut prices and save time in planning.\"\n\nThe venture also controls its entire supply chain, including land acquisition, factory production, on-site construction, sales and marketing. This helps reduce costs.\n\nSilviaBo homes have some key differences from traditional BoKlok builds, though the homes will operate under BoKlok's \"Left to Live\" payment model, where residents are charged only what they can afford after taxes and living expenses.\n\n\"It's still the same floor layout, but you need to understand how people with dementia react in certain situations,\" Spangenberg said.\n\nFor example, there are no mirrors or dark-colored floors in the bathroom, which could scare or confuse residents.\n\nSilviaBo also plans to offer a version of its home for people who are around 65-years-old and newly retired, with small adjustments and the option to easily add certain accessibility functions.\n\nThe pitch, according to Spangenberg: \"Make that clever move now, before it's too late.\"", "description": "As Sweden's population ages, the country faces a challenge: how can it maintain support for its citizens without breaking the bank?", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190718153003-queen-silvia-of-sweden-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
