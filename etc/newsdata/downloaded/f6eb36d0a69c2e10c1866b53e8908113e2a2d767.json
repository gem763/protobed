Or as Revis considers him, by far the best corner in the game.\n\nStephen Gilmore by far is the best corner in the game right now. #shutdown #numberone \u2014 Darrelle Revis (@Revis24) October 11, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRevis tweeted that compliment at the tail end of Thursday\u2019s game between the Patriots and New York Giants. Gilmore had a big hand in the win with one pick and five pass deflections, one of which led to a John Simon interception.\n\nGilmore displayed incredible technique until the bitter end. While up 35-14 with less than three minutes left in the fourth, Gilmore punched up through Darius Slayton's hands to knock out a deep pass on fourth-and-10 from the Giants\u2019 37. Another former Pat, Dont\u00e9 Stallworth, jumped in on Twitter, as well, to call him \u201cone of the most technically sound corners I\u2019ve ever watched in the NFL.\u201d\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nStory continues\n\nA former first-round pick of the Buffalo Bills, Gilmore has been the face of the Patriots\u2019 defense since coming over in free agency two years ago. In 2018, he made his first All-Pro team after registering a career-high 20 pass deflections, and the advanced numbers back up his talent too. Pro Football Focus ranked him as the No. 1 cornerback last season after ranking fourth in the league from 2017-18 in completion percentage allowed (50.3 percent).\n\nThe Patriots own the top pass defense in the league, and it\u2019s not particularly close. They\u2019re tops in passing yards per game allowed (161) with second place 14.8 yards behind. The gap is even bigger in passer rating allowed (42.6 vs. 62.8) and interceptions (14 vs. 7), and it\u2019s hard not to see Gilmore as the catalyst on this dominant unit.\n\nIs Stephon Gilmore the top cornerback in the NFL? (Mark Brown/Getty Images)\n\nIs Gilmore the best defensive back on the Pats?\n\nOne problem: Gilmore does not rate as the best defensive back in the league this season, according to Pro Football Focus. He\u2019s not even the best on his team.\n\nDespite two picks and eight pass deflections through six games, Gilmore only rates as the No. 40 cornerback in the league this season. And the Nos. 1 and 2 players are his own teammates: Jonathan Jones and Jason McCourty.\n\nJones has been a huge asset in the slot, where the Patriots have held opponents to a 42 passer rating. As PFF points out, he holds opponents to under five yards per target when lined up there. Meanwhile, McCourty has shown excellent coverage skills both on the inside and outside.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to definitively say that Gilmore has been passed by both teammates, as numbers take more than six weeks to stabilize. But if anything, it shows the strength of the Patriots\u2019 defense and how much of a nightmare it will be the rest of the season.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Gilmore was ranked the top cornerback by Pro Football Focus in 2018.", "authors": ["Ben Weinrib"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iHhyAHQzRScoSWnw7YLhNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTQuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5gdDPNTla6tDN0Z37plr4w--~B/aD0zMzk2O3c9NDc1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/36f6a9a0-ec29-11e9-affe-bf11f0848303", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
