The bank gathered 1,300 users with $6.4 billion transactions in the first nine months since its launch last February, according to a statement from the bank.\n\nBank of China processed its first international money transfer to South Korea in dollars via its patented blockchain payment system last August, while Agricultural Bank of China helped farmers with online trading by using its e-commerce blockchain financing system in August, 2017.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank started to run the Bay Area Trade Finance Blockchain Platform last September to help small and medium companies to finance in the areas between Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong province in southern China.\n\nChina Construction Bank image via CoinDesk Archive", "description": "Chinese banking giant CCB has expanded its trade finance blockchain platform with cross-chain and inter-bank transactions.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mAqa09TGnBC9px.WT53RUg--~B/aD0xMDY5O3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/57b3a1f68d718f925419b9ea540c2a5e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
