Claiming that the president and his allies were already \u201cspending massive amount[s] of money\u201d to prevent Biden from becoming the nominee, Bedingfield said the campaign had no choice to abandon its earlier pledge to discourage the aid of super Pacs.\n\n\u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to this disastrous presidency,\u201d Bedingfield said. \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFull @KBeds statement on super pac spending for Biden pic.twitter.com/lAJkWZQCTQ \u2014 Mike Memoli (@mikememoli) October 24, 2019\n\nThe move comes as Biden\u2019s campaign struggles to keep up in fundraising in comparison to candidates like South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT).\n\nAlthough the former vice president started his campaign with a strong funding advantage, thanks in part to high-dollar donors, he ended the most recent fundraising period well behind his competitors. In particular, Biden only raised $15.2 million in the third quarter of this year, far below the sums brought in by Sanders ($25.3 million), Buttigieg ($19.1 million), and Warren ($24.6 million).\n\nPosing more of a problem for the former vice president, however, is that his campaign has spent heavily since announcing in late-April, depleting his total cash on hand to just $9 million at the end of the third quarter. His rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand.\n\nBiden\u2019s cash crunch results from his inability to make in-roads with small-dollar donors. Unlike Warren or Sanders, more than 2,800 donors have already maxed out to Biden\u2019s campaign since his announcement in late April, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In fact, top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s coffers than those of his competitors.\n\nIn comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign\u2019s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he\u2019s secured the nomination. David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico this month.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can\u2019t compete,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cBiden looks like he can\u2019t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How\u2019s he going to compete with Trump?\u201d\n\nAs evidenced by its decision on Thursday, the campaign appears to have decided his best way forward is to rely on super PACs, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds. Such groups are increasingly being scorned on the left \u2014 including Biden just a few short months ago.\n\nWhen first announcing his campaign, the former vice president pledged not to accept any campaign donations from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists. Part of that pledge was also his assurance not accept money from super PACs, even going as far to discourage one that had already formed on his behalf.\n\n\u201cVice President Biden does not welcome assistance from super PACs,\u201d a campaign aide told the Huffington Post in April when asked about the PAC.\n\nAs part of its reasoning for rejecting the help, the Biden campaign pointed to the former vice president\u2019s long record of championing campaign finance reform. The candidate, himself, elaborated on his position during an interview with PBS News Hour last year while discussing campaign finance advice he purportedly gave to Sanders in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cHow will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept money?\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is reversing its position on accepting help from super PACs amid anemic fundraising.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/aug32019-joe-biden-2020pres-campaign-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
