All the victims wore orange wristbands.", "language": "en", "text": "The calls started after 3 a.m. Sunday, with reports of an unconscious man in the south side of Pittsburgh wearing an orange wristband.\n\nHe was taken to a hospital. In another call, from about two blocks away in an apartment building on the Monongahela River, a resident reported a man unconscious in an elevator. The resident pulled him out and tried CPR before police and paramedics tried to revive the man, who also wore an orange wristband.\n\nHe was pronounced dead at the scene, Chris Togneri, a city public safety spokesman, said Sunday.\n\nThen before dawn, authorities discovered a horrific scene at the same apartment building: two more dead men and three other victims with undescribed ailments ranging from serious to critical, Togneri said, and all with the same orange wristbands.\n\nPolice are racing to piece together what happened and believe the incident stems from a drug overdose, Togneri said. They have identified two venues that use orange wristbands, Togneri said, but declined to name them \u2014 saying only that they held \u201cconcerts or parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out where they were last night,\u201d Togneri said.\n\nOfficials stressed they don\u2019t believe tainted drugs were distributed in large volume with the potential to harm others.\n\n\u201cIt appears to have been isolated to a single location,\u201d officials said in a statement. \u201cHowever, police are concerned about a tainted, potentially deadly batch of drugs in the community.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have released few details. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters that he didn\u2019t believe there was a party at the building, suggesting that the victims had arrived there after a night out.\n\nHissrich speculated the two other men who were found earlier \u201cwere trying to make their way back to this location\u201d and exhibited similar symptoms.\n\nParamedics tested the air inside the building and deemed it safe, Hissrich said.\n\nRead more:\n\nHe went underwater to propose to his girlfriend.
