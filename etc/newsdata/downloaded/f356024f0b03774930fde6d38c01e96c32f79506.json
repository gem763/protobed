Mothers often pass down the tradition to their daughters.\n\nAlthough Ms Hodson said she supports the exams\u2019 goal of connecting women with sexual health care, she said she is concerned that some of the commonly used language frames sex as a medical issue, rather than as a normal human activity.\n\nMs Hodson said promoting the use of a dilator, which is unnecessary for most people, is an example of how premarital exams can make sexual intimacy sound like a problem to be solved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more of a disease model, rather than, \u2018this is a normal, healthy part of life\u2019,\u201d Ms Hodson said. \u201cLike, \u2018We need to prepare your vagina in a medical way to make sure sex is okay,\u2019 rather than, \u2018look, people can have really positive first-time experiences\u2019.\u201d\n\nDr Gunter said she thought premarital exams could unnecessarily scare women about sex and that targeting them only to women was patriarchal.\n\nShe said she also was put off by what she saw as the suggestion that women need to prepare their bodies for sex and that waiting until immediately before marriage was the right time to do so.\n\n\u201cIt is true that women may want to come in and get some education about their bodies if they can\u2019t get it somewhere else,\u201d Dr Gunter said. \u201cBut to suggest that the only time you would want to get educated about your body is before your wedding night is a little bit more problematic.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Utah Health has revised its main website page about premarital exams since Dr Gunter published her blog post.\n\nThe page now calls the consultations \u201csexual health visits\u201d and states that the health-care system does not recommend that women take antibiotics before sexual activity if they do not have an infection. The information about dilators has been removed.\n\nOfficials and doctors at University of Utah Health declined an interview request from The Post but said in a statement that their staff seeks to offer relevant, accessibly worded medical information to a variety of communities with different health-care needs.\n\n\u201cOur objective in serving the segment of our patient population that requests \u2018premarital visits\u2019 is to inform and educate \u2013 and in so doing build lifelong relationships as their trusted health care partner,\u201d Kathy Wilets, a spokeswoman for the health-care system, said in the statement.\n\nMs Wilets told the Salt Lake Tribune that although the medical term for the consultation is \u201csexual health visit\u201d, the health-care system started using the phrase \u201cpremarital exam\u201d after noticing that women were using that name to ask for the consultations and search for them online.\n\nThe website pages about premarital exams were targeted towards \u201cheterosexual women who have remained abstinent from sexual activity, are about to get married and who have questions/concerns about their first sexual experience,\u201d Ms Wilets told the Tribune.\n\nThe health-care system plans to update its website soon to include information about sexual health visits for men after seeing an increased interest in the topic, Ms Wilets said.\n\nTiffany Weber, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at University of Utah Hospital, told the Tribune that many women who seek premarital exams \u201chave misinformation and misconceptions\u201d. The consultations are meant to ensure the patients\u2019 safety as they begin having sex, she said.\n\nThe patients only need physical exams if they have particular worries or symptoms, Ms Weber said.\n\nShe said the health-care system\u2019s website previously mentioned dilators and getting prescriptions for antibiotics in case of UTIs even though they are \u201cactually not evidence-based procedures\u201d because patients frequently wanted to talk about them.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Dr Jen Gunter\u00a0has said she nearly fell off her chair when she saw the headline on the University of Utah\u2019s medical centre website. \"Getting ready for your wedding night with a premarital exam.\" Dr Gunter, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, and author of The Vagina Bible,\u00a0says she had never heard of a premarital exam.
