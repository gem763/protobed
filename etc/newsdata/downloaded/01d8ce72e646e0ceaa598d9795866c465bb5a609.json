He\u2019s a very, very smart guy. He\u2019s extremely affable. He\u2019s a friendly guy. Everybody likes Mark. He\u2019s a great hire,\u201d Glueck said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, right? Enron hired a lot of great people.\"\n\nSo what does this mean for Google?\n\nGoogle will have a new commander as it enters the D.C. fight in earnest. Google's spending on lobbying actually shrank for the first half of this year, including its lowest quarterly total since 2011, despite the cascading threats the company faces in Congress and the executive branch. (In contrast, Amazon and Facebook shelled out record sums to lobby the federal government.)\n\nAt the very least, Isakowitz's hiring should bring greater stability to the company's Washington operations after a year of change. Bhatia has put his stamp on Google's public policy operations since taking over last summer, restructuring the company's internal lobbying and policy teams and setting changes in motion that have led some staff to take on new roles and others to depart the company.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Google shelled out a record $21.2 million to lobby the federal government in 2018 \u2014 but amid its internal changes, its spending in the first half of this year has been trending downward.\n\nWho is Isakowitz?\n\nAs Portman's chief of staff since 2014, Isakowitz has had a hand in tax reform, trade policy and opioid legislation. Notably, Portman's office also took the lead on a piece of legislation that rankled Google and others in the tech industry: the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act.\n\nThat bill amended a key 1996 law that has shielded online companies from legal liability for content posted by their users. Now lawmakers are mulling additional changes that could expose websites to lawsuits over content related to illegal drug sales, violent extremism and child exploitation.\n\nBefore the Hill, Isakowitz spent 16 years at the all-GOP lobbying firm Fierce, Isakowitz & Blalock, where his clients included Ford, BP America and Coca-Cola. He was previously a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, and has worked on congressional, gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.\n\n\"Mark's ability to understand both a company's culture and their needs in Washington will be invaluable to Google,\" said Josh Ackil, a Democratic lobbyist and partner at Franklin Square Group, which previously lobbied for Google. \"His business sense, political skill and knowledge of how D.C. works puts him at the top of the list.\"\n\nWhat will he face at Google?\n\nGoogle, like other big tech companies, is facing unprecedented levels of scrutiny in Washington and the states. Among the most immediate threats is the Justice Department's investigation of the company for possible antitrust violations. Google is simultaneously facing an antitrust investigation launched by the attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. They're taking a magnifying glass to Google's online search and digital advertising businesses, and have begun peppering the company with questions about its past acquisitions.\n\nWhile Google has faced similar inquiries in Europe in recent years, the U.S investigations come at a time when political rhetoric against the industry is at an all-time high.\n\nRepublicans accuse Google, Facebook and Twitter of harboring a conservative bias that results in their speech being suppressed online. That has animated a number of hearings on Capitol Hill, including one this summer in which Bhatia faced questions before a Senate Judiciary panel.\n\nSeparately, Google is facing the prospect of federal privacy legislation that could curtail its collection and use of consumer data. Google's YouTube just got slapped with a $170 million fine from the Federal Trade Commission over its handling of children's data.\n\nThe states are also proving to be a battleground. California has pulled ahead of Congress in passing its own privacy legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which tech firms oppose. Just this week, the multimillionaire developer who championed the privacy law in California announced plans to pursue another privacy-related ballot initiative.\n\nHence the need for someone with Isakowitz's resume, some critics of Silicon Valley said Friday.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, this is an old-school strategy that the tech industry is catching up on,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen. \"This is how banks and pharma and many other big industries have long lobbied and hired staff and thought about using a revolving door.\"\n\nDoes it matter he's a Republican?\n\nSilicon Valley is known for its liberal politics, but the top levels of their Washington offices often lean right. Other big technology firms, including Facebook and Amazon, also have leaders in D.C. with ties to Republican politics.\n\nThat can be especially critical as a number of Republicans, including Trump, have taken to hammering the industry.\n\nZach Graves, head of policy for the conservative group Lincoln Networks, said Isakowitz's Republican bona fides could help Google \u2014 if they're for more than just show.\n\nTech companies often \"don't empower them to do the things that are really necessary to get conservative buy-in,\" Graves said. \"The question is not just whether they have a symbolic Republican, but whether that person is empowered enough to really shape their policies and product decisions.\"\n\nBut the tech backlash hasn't only come from the right. Democrats have been sharply critical of the industry when it comes to election interference on social media and market concentration, with progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) leading calls to break up the companies.\n\nVerdery, the Republican lobbyist, said Isakowitz's broad background can still be a big asset to Google.\n\n\"While everybody is focused understandably on the current fights around competition and privacy, a company as wide-ranging as Google has needs far beyond one set of hearings,\" he said. \"Somebody has to be able to see a wide range of issues \u2014 tax, trade, foreign relations, workforce \u2014 and develop strategies across many stakeholders \u2014 Congress, agencies, interest groups, trade groups, etc.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a8/cb/9badb4a64955b773cf34f6e487ee/19927-google-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
