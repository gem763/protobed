There's no wind. It's nothing. There's no reason why they should shut the power off.'\n\n'They're ... closing everything down so they don't get sued. They don't trim the trees, so we suffer.'\n\nBefore the blackout in Moraga, California, gas stations were overflowing with anxious residents and people swarmed the only supermarket in town trying to stock up on supplies.\n\nBags of ice, canned goods, loaves of bread, cereal and water were hot commodity items.\n\nPG&E shared maps (pictured) outlining potential areas in California that could be affected, including parts of San Francisco, Redding and Sacramento\n\nCalifornia residents in potential cut off zones rushed to local gas stations to stock on on gas and other items before the preventative measure went into affect\n\nAt Moroga Hardware and Lumber, the owner Bill Snider said they sold 500 flashlights and were pressed for items like extension cords.\n\nGenerators were dwindling and near impossible to find.\n\nSome of the power shutoff's biggest critics are those who rely on electric medical supplies for health conditions and senior citizens who live in assisted living.\n\nDrivers were left trying to navigate the roadways when traffic lights went dark in parts of California (pictured)\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports that the Ukiah Senior Center was desperately trying to collect goods in preparation for the outage by buying butane canisters so they could make coffee and freezing water bottles in case of a prolonged power outage.\n\nDiana Clarke, the senior center's executive director, said: 'People have been on pins and needles all day because of the uncertainty.'\n\n'They don't know if they should go out and buy supplies, and especially with seniors, they don't have a lot of extra money.'\n\nThe senior center provides residents with hot meals five days a week and delivers meals to elderly residents who cannot leave their home.\n\nCalifornia's rushed to supermarkets, gas stations and hardware stores in search of diminishing items like bottled water (pictured)\n\nIn the day leading up to the power outage, the center was forced to tell people the power cuts may affect their ability to delivery food.\n\nClarke says there's mistrust in the community surrounding the power cuts and fingers are pointed squarely at PG&E.\n\n'PG&E should have been doing the proper maintenance for the last decade. This wouldn't have been necessary [if they had], and I think that's what has got everyone so angry and frustrated with PG&E right now. This is a crisis of PG&E's making,' Clarke told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe Ukiah Senior Center is luckily sparred from the power cuts after city officials sent an email saying they would be spared.\n\nAccording to PG&E, around 2 million people are expected to be affected for up to several days.\n\nPG&E's latest preventative measure is the largest effort to prevent wildfires caused by windblown power lines in the state's history\n\nA Target in Marin City, California, (pictured) is one of the many businesses affected by the PG&E power cuts on Wednesday\n\nAs of now, wildfires have only accounted for a small percentage of the acres burned in recent years.\n\nCompared to last year's almost 1,000 square miles of scorched land, this year's 63 square miles haven't posed the same risk.\n\nStill PG&E and meteorologists are telling residents to hunker down and the power cuts are a preventative measure to ensure destructive blazes don't inflict preventable damage.\n\nSteve Anderson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Bay Area office, said: 'To everyone asking, \"Where's the wind? Where's the wind?\" Don't worry, the wind is coming. Go for a hike above 4,000 feet and you'll feel it.'\n\nPG&E workers (pictured) working on underground electric lines days before the company announced the power shutoff in northern and central California\n\nA lone shopper walks through the aisles of a darkened supermarket to purchase supplies on Wednesday (pictured)\n\n'Obviously PG&E doesn't want to cut the power when there's already strong winds. You want to cut the power before it happens.'\n\nPG&E says the upcoming winds will be the strongest and most comprehensive the region has encountered in two years.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, California's governor, said people have a right to be upset.\n\nNewsom said the power company needs to upgrade their equipment so massive power outages do not become the go-to answer for preventing wildfires.\n\n'No one is satisfied with this, no one is happy with this,' he said after the announcement.", "description": "The PG&E power shutoff that began Wednesday morning has left Californians outraged as they scramble to collect supplies for the state's largest wildfire prevention measure in history", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19514914-0-image-a-15_1570660460260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
