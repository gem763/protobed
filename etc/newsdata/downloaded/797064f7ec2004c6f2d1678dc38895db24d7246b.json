An attorney for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj, told The Times that \"any decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistleblower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm's way.\"\n\nIn a statement, The Times' executive editor, Dean Baquet, said the whistleblower's role and \"place in the government\" was \"essential to understanding one of the most important issues facing the country \u2014 whether the president of the United States abused power and whether the White House covered it up.\"\n\nThe whistleblower said the complaint was based on information relayed by \"more than half a dozen U.S. officials.\"\n\nThe complaint outlined concerns that Trump's efforts to engage the Ukrainian government in hurting a political rival might not only violate US campaign-finance law but \"pose risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. Government's efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\"", "description": "The Times described the whistleblower, whose name is still unknown, as a \"CIA officer who was detailed to work at the White House at one point.\"", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8cfde82e22af07ea0d2ea4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
