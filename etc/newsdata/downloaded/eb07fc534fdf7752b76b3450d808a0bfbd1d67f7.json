USA TODAY\n\nPumpkin spice fans, here's another reason to get pumped up.\n\nStarbucks has added a second pumpkin drink \u2013 the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew \u2013 in addition to the Pumpkin Spice Latte or PSL for short, which returned Aug. 27.\n\nThis is Starbucks\u2019 first new pumpkin coffee drink since it launched the PSL \u2013 the drink that experts say started the pumpkin craze \u2013 in 2003. The drink is made with Starbucks Cold Brew, vanilla, and is finished with a pumpkin cream cold foam and a pumpkin spice topping.\n\n\u201cWith customer excitement for PSL sweeping the nation each fall, we wanted to create a new beverage that combines two of our customers\u2019 favorite things, pumpkin spices and cold brew,\u201d said Matthew Thornton, of Starbucks beverage research and development team, in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nSpooky special items: Starbucks, Burger King, Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' scaring up Halloween-themed items\n\nToys R Us comeback: New Toys R Us Adventure interactive play lands open and stores coming soon\n\nAccording to Starbucks, the PSL is its top-selling seasonal beverage of all time with more than 424 million sold in the U.S. since its release 16 years ago. The PSL is available hot, iced or as a Frappuccino-blended beverage.\n\nAs part of the fall menu, Starbucks also brought back the Salted Caramel Mocha, pumpkin cream cheese muffin and pumpkin scone.\n\nApester, a digital storytelling content platform, said 62.5% of consumers surveyed said they thought Starbucks is releasing its pumpkin drink too early this year. Last year, pumpkin returned to Starbucks on Aug. 28, a day dubbed Pumpkinox.\n\nThe pumpkin pandemonium started Aug. 21 at Dunkin' locations nationwide when its new fall lineup with new and returning items arrived.
