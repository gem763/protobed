They deserve better consideration than they are getting. But it's pretty clear they are unacceptable to Brussels.\n\nIreland and other EU countries have several objections, which come down to this.\n\nThey don't want two different customs regimes on the island of Ireland \u2014 one in the Republic, the other in the North \u2014 and the consequent paraphernalia of customs checks near the border.\n\nAngela Merkel reiterated that Northern Ireland should stay in the Customs Union during a telephone conversation with Boris Johnson on Monday\n\nIn short, they want Northern Ireland firmly in the Customs Union.\n\nThis is what, according to No 10, Angela Merkel reiterated in a peevish telephone conversation with Boris Johnson on Monday.\n\nSuch an outcome can't be delivered, of course, partly because the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) won't entertain fundamentally separate arrangements for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, and partly because many Tories, including Boris himself, are queasy about the idea.\n\nRisky\n\nSo the nightmare goes on. A deal with the EU seems as distant as ever.\n\nThe Prime Minister will presumably have to write the letter stipulated by the Benn Act requesting a Brexit extension.\n\nThere will be a subsequent General Election, if Labour will allow it.\n\nWill Boris win a working majority? It's bound to be risky going to the country without having taken Britain out of the EU on October 31 as promised.\n\nMaybe he'll be able to convince voters that he has been stitched up by a Remainer Parliament.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson will presumably have to write the letter stipulated by the Benn Act requesting a Brexit extension\n\nAll we can say is that victory for the Tories is far from certain.\n\nIn two months' time, we could still be lumbered with a new Parliament with no party enjoying an overall majority.\n\nJeremy Corbyn might be leader of the largest one and could cobble together an alliance with him as PM.\n\nDouble nightmare.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses are screaming for some resolution to this debilitating saga, while the economy is stuttering alarmingly for the first time since the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics has just announced the biggest fall in productivity for five years.\n\nSo let's agree about this. It's in the best interests of the country, Mr Johnson, the Conservative Party and our collective sanity for a sensible and honourable deal to be made before October 31.\n\nOne idea doing the rounds in Brussels is for Northern Ireland to remain in the Customs Union until or unless there is a majority among the unionist DUP and nationalist Sinn Fein in the Stormont Assembly to pull out of it after several years.\n\nBut the DUP dislike the scheme because they fear Northern Ireland could be locked into the Customs Union for ever.\n\nAnd Sinn Fein aren't keen because they want the Irish Republic government to have a say. It doesn't look as though this Brussels wheeze will fly.\n\nLet me therefore float another thought. I don't claim authorship.\n\nIt comes from the powerful mind of William Hague, former Tory leader, and Foreign Secretary from 2010 until 2014.\n\nAll that would be needed, for Lord Hague's proposal to be accepted, is for about 20 words to be added to Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement. That's all.\n\nThen the UK could leave the EU on satisfactory terms, and we could all get back to living our lives.\n\nIn essence, the idea is as follows. Britain and Northern Ireland would remain in the Customs Union for a fixed period \u2014 say three or four years \u2014 following which the UK could unilaterally withdraw when it wanted.\n\nWilliam Hague, former Tory leader, and Foreign Secretary from 2010 until 2014\n\nDuring this time, London and Brussels would strain every sinew to devise new customs arrangements, employing the latest technology so as to avoid the hard border which everyone agrees is undesirable.\n\nThe UK would then leave intact. Northern Ireland wouldn't be abandoned in an anomalous position inside the Customs Union. Part of the United Kingdom would not be kept inside the EU.\n\nNeedless to say, there would have to be compromise on all sides for such a solution to be accepted. Every party would have to give a little, though not necessarily an enormous, amount of ground.\n\nBoris Johnson, despite having said that the backstop must be binned, would have to accept its retention, but only on a temporary basis. I don't see why this would be an insuperable obstacle, given his admission that his latest proposal involves compromise.\n\nThe DUP would have little difficulty in accepting time- limited membership of the Customs Union, provided that the rest of the UK was in step, and quit such arrangements at the same time.\n\nWhich leaves the other 27 EU countries. They would have to change their tune significantly.\n\nEarlier this year, they refused to offer Theresa May a guarantee that the backstop wouldn't be permanent, even though such a concession would probably have enabled her to get her deal through the Commons.\n\nEndless\n\nAnd yet Brussels has repeatedly declared that the backstop should not be for all time, and that it will use its best endeavours with the UK to find an alternative solution based on new technology.\n\nSome Brexiteers claim EU negotiators are being insincere, and that they want to bind not only Great Britain but also Northern Ireland in an endless Customs Union in which the UK would have to observe EU rules without having a place at the table.\n\nCertainly the EU's instant rejection of Mr Johnson's plan suggests a rigidity of mind, and possibly a furtive determination to lock the province in the Customs Union.\n\nSo this would be a moment of truth for Brussels. If it were to veto the UK pulling out of the Customs Union at an agreed time, that would be proof that it is never prepared to set Northern Ireland free. This is the ultimate test of the EU leaders' good faith.\n\nSuch a deal would almost certainly be accepted by the Commons. The Government could expect the support of the DUP, most hardline Tory Brexiteers, the majority of Remainers recently thrown out of the party, and Labour MPs such as Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, who want a deal that honours the referendum result.\n\nSevere\n\nRemember that Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady's amendment \u2014 which called on the Government to renegotiate the Northern Ireland backstop and replace it with 'alternative arrangements' \u2014 passed the Commons in January, though Brussels didn't take it seriously.\n\nAt the eleventh hour, might it now consider a time limit for the backstop? Mr Johnson can find out only by trying.\n\nAlthough EU leaders have said in the past that they won't re-open the Withdrawal Agreement, they have recently shown a readiness to re-negotiate after all.\n\nIf Brussels doesn't like Boris Johnson's plan, what about William Hague's?\n\nIs it worth risking a severe economic downturn in Britain and Ireland, and an economic recession in much of continental Europe, all because agreement can't be reached about the date the backstop should end?\n\nAs for Boris Johnson, notwithstanding vicious criticisms of him, he has demonstrated that he is flexible and reasonable, and that he much prefers a deal with the EU to No Deal.\n\nWill Ireland's PM, Leo Varadkar, be equally accommodating if, as planned, they meet today?\n\nIt won't be easy. In fact, I'm happy to admit it's a long shot. But if anyone has another plan more likely to succeed, I'd very much like to know what it is.", "description": "STEPHEN GLOVER: Boris Johnson's latest Brexit proposals are imaginative.\u00a0They deserve better consideration than they are getting.\u00a0But it's pretty clear they are unacceptable to Brussels.", "authors": ["Stephen Glover For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19515258-0-image-a-102_1570661036537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
