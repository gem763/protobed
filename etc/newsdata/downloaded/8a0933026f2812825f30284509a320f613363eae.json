Her daughters love to dance, so they did a choreographed dance at this real estate party that I was at when I was 9. And I saw her dancing and I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s get married!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe 26-year-old Chicago native had previously opened up about how he and Bennett met in a series of tweets in March, shortly before the two threw a gala wedding celebration. (The couple had already legally tied the knot in a civil ceremony in December 2018.)\n\nAt that Christmas party nearly two decades ago, Bennett and others were performing a routine to \u201cIndependent Women Part 1\u201d by Destiny\u2019s Child.\n\n\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t even say \u2018locked eyes\u2019 \u2019cause really I was just staring at her, as she and her girls were conquering this choreography and mastering the art of lip-syncing in a way even the most professional performers have yet to accomplish,\u201d he said.\n\nThough his father encouraged him to join Bennett on the dance floor, Chance quipped, \u201cYoung me was shy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the time or place,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just because it wasn\u2019t my party, not because it was their moment to dance, not even \u2019cause I was nervous about dancing in front of folks. It\u2019s \u2019cause I knew I was gonna marry that girl.\u201d\n\nThough Chance\u2019s music career is in high gear now, it\u2019s clear that family comes first. Earlier this week, the rapper announced he was postponing his forthcoming tour following the Sept. 6 birth of his second daughter, Marli Grace Bennett.\n\nNonetheless, he gave fans a taste of what\u2019s in store Wednesday with a live performance of \u201cEternal,\u201d off his new album, \u201cThe Big Day.\u201d", "description": "The three-time Grammy winner told Ellen DeGeneres that he even popped the question at that very first meeting.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7968cc2300001c055157df.jpeg?cache=ceieehal1h&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
