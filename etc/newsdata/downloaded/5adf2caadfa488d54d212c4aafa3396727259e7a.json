Nifty 50 closed at 11,003 on September 9th, 2019, after facing stiff resistance at 11,028; which resulted in formation of bearish formation before closing on Monday. On Tuesday, while Indian markets remain on holiday, but most of the Asian stocks swung lower, weighed by Chinese markets; after mainland factory-gate prices shrank at their fastest pace in three years. On the other hand, reports of German stimulus plans pushed global bond prices down.\n\nOn the other hand, news flow at national level looks evident enough to show the growing weakness in Indian economy; with 23.55% decline in automobile sales during the month of August 2019; despite recently announced lending rate cut by India\u2019s top bank. This follows the steepest sales decline of 18.71% in 19 years in July 2019. Secondly, the slump in home loans reflects a slowdown in the reality sector. I find that the persisting weakness in , Nifty Auto and Nifty Realty may drag the up to much lower levels on September 11th, 2019.\n\nSecondly, at the international front, U.S. Federal Reserve is also widely expected to cut interest rates next week as policymakers race to shield the global economy from risks, which also include Britain's planned exit from the European Union. On the other hand, positive trade developments between the U.S. and China sent stocks higher this month as the two sides confirmed in-person meetings will resume in October. That caused gold to lose some safe-haven appeal. I find that the still showing signs of steep reversal from the level of $1502 which reflects the signs of weakness in global equity markets; ; which may continue on September 10th, 2019.\n\nFinally, I find that if U.S. equity indices remain in red on September 10th, 2019; may see a gap-down opening on September 11th, 2019. No doubt that Nifty 50 may try to breach immediate resistance at 11,051, but a sustainable move above this immediate resistance may only keep the Nifty in uptrend up to 11,141. On the other hand, a gap-down opening below the level of 10,967, followed by a sustainable move below the level of 10,892 may result in steep downward moves ahead.
