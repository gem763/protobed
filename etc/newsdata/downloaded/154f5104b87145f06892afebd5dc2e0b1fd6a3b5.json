Corals are made up of tiny living organisms called coral polyps, which attach themselves to the sea floor. When polyps die, they become hard, and new polyps grow on top of them. Gradually, over thousands of years, these layers form a coral reef.\n\nPolyps feed on other organisms, like plankton and algae. The algae is what gives coral its beautiful colours. But algae is usually only found close to the surface of the water, as it gets its energy from the sun. This is why coral reefs form in shallow, clear waters close to the coastline. Corals also need warm water to survive, so you\u2019ll only find them in tropical regions, near the equator.\n\nOne of the biggest and best-known coral reefs is the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which is around 2,300 kilometres long. It is so big that it can be seen from space.\n\nVideo of How Do Corals Build Reefs?

This makes them one of the most important marine biomes on the planet. As well as being filled with beauty and diversity, coral reefs are useful to humans. They provide millions of people with food. They also act as barriers which protect the shoreline from waves, storms and floods, keeping people safe and preventing property damage or coastal erosion.\n\nLesson plan: What is a coral reef?\n\nWho depends on them?\n\nCoral reefs are often referred to as the \u201crainforests of the ocean\u201d, because they are full of life. Many animals, like sponges, starfish, and clams, attach themselves to reefs, covering them almost entirely. Thousands of species of fish, from clownfish and puffer fish to eels and reef sharks, also call the reef home, while plant species include various types of sea grass and seaweed.\n\nAccording to some estimates, as many as 1 billion humans also rely on coral reefs for food or to make a living. Because reefs support so much marine life, they tend to be the main source of food for coastal and island communities. They also draw in a lot of tourism, and local economies depend on the income this generates. A 2002 study estimated the value of coral reefs at US$10 billion - although their value extends far beyond dollars and cents.\n\nWhy are they at risk?\n\nThe biggest threats to coral reefs are pollution, overfishing, coastal development, and climate change. Coral reefs need clean, clear water. When pollutants enter the water, they smother reefs, preventing them from getting enough sunlight. They also speed up the growth of certain algae which damage reefs.\n\nOverfishing causes the numbers of many key species - such as those which eat the damaging algae - to drop. Some types of fish traps also damage coral when they land on it. In addition, many fish breed and nurse their young in reefs, so targeting these areas for fishing kills lots of young fish before they have had a chance to reproduce.\n\nCoastal development - such as the construction of roads, hotels, and restaurants for tourism - causes more waste and pollutants to enter the water, while tourists can also damage coral just by touching it.\n\nMangroves around the world: Why these tropical swamps are an important ecosystem for marine life and coastal communities\n\nClimate change is also a major factor. Warming waters cause the colourful algae that live in coral to leave, turning the coral white. This doesn\u2019t kill the coral, but it makes it a lot more vulnerable. In recent years, coral bleaching has affected every coral reef on Earth. The Great Barrier Reef suffered the worst bleaching events in recorded history in 2016 and 2017. It is thought to have lost around half of its coral.\n\nBecause coral reefs grow so slowly, they are disintegrating faster than they can be repaired. About half the world\u2019s shallow water coral reefs have already disappeared.\n\nHow can we protect them?\n\nLarge-scale initiatives to combat climate change, like the 2015 Paris Accord, may help to reduce the risk of such severe coral bleaching events in the future. But smaller-scale initiatives, like the banning of destructive fishing gear, and a shift towards sustainable tourism and fishing, are also vital for keeping coral reefs healthy.\n\nLast year, hundreds of governments, private companies, non-government organisations and local communities pledged their support for a new action plan to protect ocean biodiversity. It is an important step which will tackle the threats to coral reefs from different angles and at both a community and global level.\n\nAs individuals, we can do our bit by adopting ocean-friendly habits, such as using less plastic, following sustainable seafood guides, and choosing eco-certified travel operators.\n\nEdited by Ginny Wong", "description": "The biggest threats these beautiful underwater ecosystems are pollution, overfishing, coastal development, and climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/australia_great_barrier_reef_bleaching_aap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
