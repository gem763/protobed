Meanwhile, China\u2019s protracted trade war with the United States remains bogged down, with few anticipating Vice Premier Liu He\u2019s trip to Washington next week for another round of talks will precipitate a breakthrough.\n\nAt home, the economy is tangibly slowing, with growth at its lowest level in more than a generation.\n\n\u201cThe parade will be glitzy. It will be confident. It will show unity and optimism,\u201d said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Australia. \u201cBut I think underlying that, there are myriad challenges and tensions, both from within China and from external sources, that are creating the condition for potential dramatic change.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Xi \u2014 who within two weeks of becoming party leader in 2012 spoke of a \u201cChinese Dream\u201d in which he would \u201crealize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d \u2014 is seeking to tell a different story.\n\nAs if to highlight the idea of a return to the republic\u2019s early fervor, Xi went to Tiananmen Square on Monday to visit the mausoleum housing the embalmed body of Mao, who died in 1976. He bowed three times before a statue of the founder before paying respects to his remains, according to the People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party.\n\nThe rare pilgrimage \u2014 Xi last made it six years ago \u2014 underscored Xi\u2019s efforts to invoke Mao.\n\nXi wants to present himself as heir to the \u201cstruggle\u201d Mao began and discount the leaders who came between them, analysts say. That includes Deng Xiaoping, the economic visionary responsible for China\u2019s astonishing transformation in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe wants to draw a straight line between Mao and himself,\u201d Ni said. \u201cHe wants to say that the revolutionary establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China is now on the threshold of national rejuvenation. It\u2019s a very simplified story.\u201d\n\nAmid trade war, Trump drops pretense of friendship with China\u2019s Xi Jinping\n\nIn 2017, Xi elevated himself to the same level as Mao and Deng in the Chinese Communist pantheon by having his name and the phrase \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d enshrined in the constitution.\n\nIn recent weeks, Xi has been retracing Mao\u2019s steps and repeatedly invoking the Red Army\u2019s Long March and other elements of Communist Party lore in China.\n\nThe Xinhua state news agency on Monday published a long paean to Xi\u2019s leadership \u2014 it ran to almost 2,500 words in English \u2014 that explicitly drew the connection between Mao\u2019s appearance in Tiananmen Square after defeating the Nationalists and Xi\u2019s scheduled appearance there Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was there on Oct. 1, 1949, that Mao Zedong announced the birth of New China. Over the seven decades, the socialist country has blazed an extraordinary trail, rising from a \u2018poor and blank\u2019 state to a major country on the world stage,\u201d Xinhua wrote.\n\n\u201cXi, the first top Chinese leader born after 1949, is at the helm in a new era, steering the country through wind and waves to a brighter future,\u201d the agency said.\n\nIn Chairman Mao\u2019s hometown, \u2018socialist core values\u2019 and selfie sticks galore\n\nChina can\u2019t control the weather for its big 70-year bash. But it\u2019s trying.\n\nHow China is using science fiction to sell Beijing\u2019s vision of the future\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "Xi Jinping has repeatedly sought to draw a direct line from the \u201cGreat Helmsman\u201d to himself.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pYagKmOFm2JoP7EWqwdaD-POgtY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FUMPPAXDSQI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
