Graham: Trump\u2019s obstruction letter\n\nThe SCIF storm was a good stunt, and it won the president\u2019s endorsement. But it doesn\u2019t withstand much scrutiny. The protesters claimed that as Republicans they were being squeezed out of the process, but as BuzzFeed noted, 12 of them were already authorized to participate in the process, because they\u2019re members of committees involved in the depositions. Republicans have not been allowed to call witnesses, and it\u2019s easy to understand why they\u2019d feel slighted by that, but they are allowed to participate in questioning of witnesses\u2014and have been doing so, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRepublicans complain that Democrats are offering selective leaks from the hearings, and insist that the testimony, if heard in full, would exonerate Trump. But it\u2019s difficult to believe that, if there were exculpatory evidence being aired, Republicans wouldn\u2019t leak it to both the public and the White House.\n\nDemocrats now say they intend to start holding public hearings as part of the impeachment inquiry in November. The public ought to be able to see the evidence they\u2019re amassing behind closed doors, too. But they have a valid case for keeping these initial interviews private.\n\nWhile there are signal differences between an impeachment and a criminal trial, the analogy is useful for understanding the process. An impeachment is like an indictment, and the House serves as a sort of grand jury. The Senate then holds a trial; senators are like jurors. (The chief justice of the United States presides over that trial.) In this analogy, the current closed-door depositions are a little like police interviews with witnesses. These aren\u2019t held publicly, and a suspect\u2019s lawyer doesn\u2019t get to sit in on them. There are some good reasons for that, too: You don\u2019t want witnesses to coordinate their stories in order to throw off investigators.\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders are angry that these hearings are not public and say that he should be allowed to defend himself in the process, but it\u2019s a similar situation. In fact, Democratic members even charge that some witnesses are coordinating their accounts to avoid conflicts.\n\nAnother useful analogy is the most recent impeachment in U.S. history, that of President Bill Clinton in 1998 and 1999. House Republicans began the process after receiving a lengthy report from Independent Counsel Ken Starr. They didn\u2019t feel they needed to conduct the preliminary interviews that are going on now, because Starr had already conducted them\u2014in private. Republicans also complain that Democrats have not held a vote on an impeachment inquiry, and they are right that the process was different in 1998. After receiving the Starr Report, the House Judiciary Committee voted for an impeachment inquiry, followed by a full House vote. This time, the House has not carried out a full vote.", "description": "And why their complaints are finding an audience", "authors": ["David A.
