While the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a second trial after ruling the first judge erred in his instructions to the jury.\n\nJudge erred, Crown alleges\n\nFour grounds are listed in the Crown's notice of appeal, including that the judge erred \"in establishing a medical standard unknown to law.\"\n\nThe document also suggests the judge's comments in the trial \"gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias\" and that there was further error in Clackson's assessment of credibility when he took into account \"irrelevant considerations.\"\n\nClackson came under fire for comments he made about Crown witness Dr. Bamidele Adeagbo, a forensic pathologist who speaks with a thick Nigerian accent.\n\nThe judge called Adeagbo's enunciation \"garbled.\"\n\nA complaint filed with the Canadian Judicial Council asks for an investigation into Clackson's comments, which \"could be evidence of racism.\" The complaint was signed by 42 doctors, lawyers and professors.\n\nAfter he and his wife were found not guilty on Sept. 19, Stephan said his case \"helps protect parental rights\" so that parents won't be held criminally liable if they choose alternative treatments for their sick children.\n\nHe also said he would continue to fight the Alberta government for the $1.2 million he says his family has spent in legal fees.", "description": "Alberta prosecutors want the province's top court to find two parents guilty of criminal charges connected to the 2012 death of their toddler despite a judge acquitting the pair last month.", "authors": ["Cbc Calgary Reporter", "Meghan Grant Is The Courts", "Crime Reporter For Cbc Calgary.", "Follow Her On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290522.1568930461!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/david-and-collet-stephan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
