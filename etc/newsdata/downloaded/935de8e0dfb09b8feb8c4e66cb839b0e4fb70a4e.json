This time Tonga rallied from 17-0 down and a late try from flanker Zane Kapeli brought it within two points of France. But there was only one minute left and France held firm in a match where it had two second-half tries disallowed following a video review.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve qualified, first and foremost. It wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d France\u2019s head coach Jacques Brunel said. \u201cI\u2019m not worried, but I\u2019m unsatisfied. We had chances to score heavily in the first half but made handling errors because we rushed things. It\u2019s down to tension.\u201d\n\nNext Saturday\u2019s match won\u2019t get any easier on the French nerves, then, since it\u2019s against 2003 champion England and decides top spot in Pool C.\n\n\u201cOf course they are a formidable team and we know how difficult it will be\u201d Brunel said. \u201cBut I think it will be a good test before our quarterfinal.\u201d\n\nFrance led 10-0 after just six minutes at Kumamoto Stadium, with flyhalf Romain Ntamack landing a penalty goal and then converting center Virimi Vakatawa\u2019s try after he was set up by a brilliant break from left winger Alivereti Raka.\n\nThe French appeared to be in an attacking mood and, after Tonga knocked-on about 20 meters out, gained 60 meters through several phases on a surging counterattack. It ended with Tonga conceding a penalty on its own 22, but Ntamack miscued from the left.\n\nRaka made two further strong breaks through midfield before capping an excellent half with his team\u2019s second try. Taking a quick pass from scrumhalf Baptiste Serin, he collected his own kick ahead, judged the bounce well and rolled over for a try after 33 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe started poorly. If we had started well we could have won the game,\u201d Tonga coach Toutai Kefu said. \u201cOur lineout was poor, missed tackles. They hurt us quite a bit, especially on that turnover ball.\u201d\n\nTonga replied with a converted try right on halftime by Sonatane Takulua, who peeled off the back of the scrum and just made it over the line. It was awarded following a decision by the Television Match Official and he converted to cut France\u2019s lead to 17-7.\n\nCenter Malietoa Hingano got Tonga\u2019s second converted try early in the second half, after collecting right winger Cooper Vuna\u2019s kick downfield and judging the bounce better than France fullback Maxime Medard.\n\nHingano\u2019s try came just moments after France flanker Charles Ollivon had one disallowed when the TMO showed lock Sebastien Vahaamahina feeding him a forward pass.\n\nNtamack\u2019s two penalties gave France a little breathing space again at 23-14 with 20 minutes left, and when right winger Damian Penaud collected replacement scrumhalf Antoine Dupont\u2019s short pass the relief from French fans was evident.\n\nBut the celebrations were short lived when the TMO showed Medard\u2019s arm knocking the ball on when he spilled a high kick during the build up to the try.\n\nFor the second straight match, Tonga played better after the break - just like in the 28-12 defeat to Argentina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mental thing,\u201d Kefu said. \u201cSomething we have to look at.\u201d\n\nTonga started the second half with intent and camped near the French line for several phases.\n\nBut following a quick lineout combination between hooker Camille Chat and Serin which caught Tonga completely off guard, France was charging through the midfield and soon down the other end.\n\nVahaamahina fed flanker Charles Ollivon and he galloped into the right corner. But referee Nic Berry disallowed it - much to the confusion of Ntamack, who had already taken the conversion.\n\nFrance paid a price instantly.\n\nVuna kicked ahead, Medard got bamboozled by a difficult bounce, and Hingano collected it before bulldozing over for a converted try and suddenly it was 17-14.\n\nJust like in Wednesday\u2019s win against the United States and in the opening-game win against Argentina - also 23-21 - the French relinquished a comfortable position.\n\nSo Ntamack\u2019s penalty came at the right time, earning some breathing space at 20-14 with 30 minutes left to play.\n\nAfter Penaud\u2019s effort was ruled out, Tonga sensed a lifeline and threw everything into a desperate late charge.\n\nThe diminutive Dupont made a stunning tackle to deny center Siale Piutau a try, but a few seconds later Kapeli collected a kick to the left and scored.\n\nIt was too little, too late, but Tonga deserved its ovation as the 29,000-crowd chanted \u201cTonga, Tonga.\u201d\n\nDespite failing to pull clear of Tonga after a good start, France was never behind and has only trailed briefly - for a total of four minutes against Argentina - in three matches.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "France held off a spirited Tonga comeback to win 23-21 on Sunday and join group rival England in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
