So, no question the data is mixed. Soft data is just that: It's soft,\" Agati said Friday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\"\n\nAgati, who doesn't envision a recession hitting the U.S. until at least 2021, believes the bullish driver will be third quarter earnings season, which is scheduled to kick-off the week of October 14.\n\n\"Q3 and Q4 earnings will come in better than expected,\" said Agati, who predicts the results will help the market rise 4 to 5% from current levels. That gain would put the S&P 500 and Dow back at record highs.\n\nRight now, Refinitiv estimates Q3 earnings per share for the S&P 500 will fall by 2.7%.", "description": "PNC Financial's Amanda Agati believes earnings will help boost stocks over the next three months.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104669355-GettyImages-823204212-bull-crowd.jpg?v=1535659369", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
