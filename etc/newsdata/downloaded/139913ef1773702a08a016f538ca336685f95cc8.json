The answer might be nothing. On a chilly and dark afternoon in Glasgow, at least two dozen people are waiting in line, eager to get close to their idol. Dressing appropriately for the freezing weather? Fuck it. Fans are wearing everything from full PVC to Clueless (or is it \u201cFancy\u201d?) cosplay.\n\nBackstage, with hair slicked back and popping pink eyeshadow, the star herself is getting ready for the show. It\u2019s the first night of her UK tour after a packed out run Stateside, and she\u2019s eager to get on stage. It\u2019s all systems go at the moment, both for Charli and her fans. In the past week, she\u2019s wrapped one tour, kick started this one and revealed a new Netflix original series that captures the ascent of the girl band she helped form, Nasty Cherry.\n\nShe\u2019s also, as you\u2019ve probably noticed by now, become the gay internet\u2019s best friend; a strange source of meme-ish excellence. First there were the fans who rocked up to her meet and asked her to say \u2018Gay rights!\u2019 while brandishing a bottle of poppers. Then there was the Chicago couple who chose her to witness their engagement. She also correctly foreshadowed Kylie Jenner\u2019s pop career (\u201cRiiise and shiiiine!\u201d). But then it got weird. Like, dead mother\u2019s ashes and douches weird.\n\nSo how\u2019s Charli handling it so far? Well, we met in between the ashes and douche moment, so we can\u2019t speak for her condition for the latter encounter. However, she seems to be taking it all in her stride. Before she went on stage, we spoke about Netflix binges, being back on tour for what feels like forever, and how #MomsAshesGate actually went down.\n\nYou wrapped the US tour earlier in the week. What have you been doing since?\n\nI\u2019ve just been hanging with my mum and we started watching Succession. Do you watch it?\n\nNo, but it seems like everyone else does.\n\nI just started watching it on Friday! It\u2019s good.\n\nAre you in?\n\nI\u2019m in. Six episodes.\n\nDo you binge watch most things like that?\n\nYeah! With Game of Thrones, I was a big binge watcher -- and a re-watcher. I love watching Harry Potter every two years or so. I go through them all. It kind of makes me upset when people dip in and out of the series. We started Homeland too, but I didn\u2019t realise it was ten seasons. But we did watch one season in three days. Hm, what else? Oh, I binged Breaking Bad! And I\u2019ll binge watch my Netflix show too, obviously!\n\nOh yeah! Are you excited about that?\n\nI\u2019m nervous! It\u2019s my first foray into this and honestly, none of us knew what we were doing. Legit. I started this project in the midst of being in between things. Me and my best friend Emmy came up with the concept together. None of us had any background in TV or talking to networks or selling a show. We were just kind of like, \u2018Fuck, we\u2019re doing it!\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s done!\n\nExactly. There were definitely people who helped us along the way but the core team was us. I\u2019m really proud of it. I know that, and I love the band. It shows what it is like to be in music now, and I think nobody\u2019s documented the realities of that in 2019. You have the fantasy stories and documentaries that capture the past. There is no way to break a successful band now, so why not use everyone\u2019s favourite streaming platform to, you know? Educate!\n\nSo the gays have been putting you through it on this tour.\n\nWhat have they been doing? [She takes a brief pause] Oh my god, wait! Have you seen the picture of me online holding someone\u2019s dead mum? Is it about that?! How mad.\n\nWhat was that conversation like?\n\nThis is the thing. The conversation was so quick and normal. It just flowed. First, he was like: \u2018Hey! Release \"Taxi\", I\u2019m so excited for the show \u2013 by the way, my mum passed away\u2019. I said \u2018I\u2019m really sorry\u2019, so he said \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, can you just take a picture of you holding her ashes?\u2019.\n\nIt was almost like they were in a poppers bottle. I was like [Charli makes the sound of someone who\u2019s been thrown a baseball with no warning]... and then it happened, and now it\u2019s online. My face is sort of like\u2026. Well, you can see it in my eyes, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nIt\u2019s got the same energy as the poppers \u2018Gay Rights!\u2019 video. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re holding you hostage.\n\nNo! I sign a lot of poppers, people ask me to say 'gay rights' a lot -- but like, great! Gay rights! That\u2019s a great thing to say. But yeah, holding the ashes was\u2026 new, and hopefully a one time thing. I love Twitter culture though. People were like \u2018Your mum looks so hot!\u2019. I love the fans, so they can get away with quite a lot.\n\nThe tour has been sort of non-stop hasn\u2019t it? Do you like it that way?\n\nYeah, I do. I like the go-go-go-ness of it, because when I stop, I have a breakdown. That\u2019s when all the real thoughts come in. The \u2018What am I doing?\u2019 and \u2018What will I be doing in 10 year\u2019s time?\u2019 thoughts. The real shit happens and then I cry. So I like it when it\u2019s busy because it\u2019s exciting. I have a lot more creative ideas when I feel I don\u2019t have time to get into them. I can touch on a million things and get inspired.\n\nHave you been recording?\n\nI\u2019ve done a little bit of recording but not that much. I wanted to do more but my show is really hard. It\u2019s very physical, and I don't sleep that well so I\u2019m tired and run down all the time. But I\u2019m thinking about it! There are a lot of other things I\u2019m doing that still feel really creative.\n\nI suppose this is the first traditional tour you\u2019ve done in\u2026\n\nSo long.\n\nBesides the Taylor stadium tour that you were doing alongside the sporadic Pop 2 shows. This is the first proper on-the-road, headline experience you\u2019ve had in a while.\n\nSince 2014/15, maybe? You know, I didn\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it, but I also didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy it as much as I am right now. I just really like it because I feel like it\u2019s the first time where I\u2019ve been on tour and felt in love with the music and in love with performing. I can see the crowd don\u2019t just love one song -- they love every song! It\u2019s all about the experience of being there. The experience of being in a weird cult together. I\u2019ve done really great shows before, but it\u2019s never felt quite like this. It\u2019s important to me.\n\nCharli XCX is currently on her UK tour but it\u2019s all sold out so tough luck. She\u2019ll hit mainland Europe on November 4th and you can get the last few tickets here .\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Ft. dead mother's ashes and douches.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db87f27899727008de3442f/lede/1572372411312-A433.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8566xh;0xw,0.1325xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
