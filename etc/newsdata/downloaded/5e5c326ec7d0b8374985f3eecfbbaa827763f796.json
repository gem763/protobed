In the Middle East, the ISIS caliphate has been destroyed, and we\u2019ve stopped handing billions in cash to Iran that it used to fund terrorism. The North Korean regime is no longer testing long-range missiles. America is once again treating the Cuban dictatorship like the pariah it is, and Maduro\u2019s days are numbered in Venezuela\n\n\u201cAmerica is strong again, and it\u2019s because of President Trump\u2019s decisions,\u201d she added.\n\nThe former Trump administration official issued her glowing praise of President Trump ahead of a New York City fundraiser this weekend in support of the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cHaley will be a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the Trump Victory Committee\u2019s Fall Retreat, along with Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., Donald Trump Jr., and Kimberly Guilfoyle,\u201d Fox News reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to partner with the RNC supporting President Trump\u2019s reelection, and I look forward to doing more for his campaign in the next year,\u201d she told the news outlet.\n\nHaley\u2019s support for a second Trump term is nothing new. Upon announcing her resignation from post last October, she immediately squashed speculation that she would challenge her former boss for the White House.\n\n\u201cNo, I am not running in 2020,\u201d said Haley, flanked by the president in the Oval Office. \u201cI look forward to supporting the president in the next election.\u201d\n\nDespite her support for President Trump, Haley hasn\u2019t taken his side in battles with Democrats. In August, the former U.S. diplomat responded directly to the president\u2019s early tweet regarding Rep. Elijah Cummings\u2019 (D-MD) home burglary, tweeting that his comment was \u201cso unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!\u201d tweeted the president at the time.\n\nThis is so unnecessary. \ud83d\ude44 \u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) August 2, 2019\n\nThis was far from the first time Haley had taken a shot at the president.\n\nShe was critical of then-candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential election, previously declaring that he represented \u201ceverything a governor doesn\u2019t want in a president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want someone who is going to hold Republicans accountable, and I want someone who is going to make a difference, not just for our party but for every person they represent in the country,\u201d Haley, then the governor of South Carolina, told reporters ahead of the South Carolina Republican primary in February 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Haley endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) in his failed bid for the White House.\n\nDespite her repeated attacks, President Trump nominated Haley for U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., a role she fulfilled between January 2017 and December 2018. Since leaving the administration, she has joined Boeing\u2019s board of directors and formed the \u201cStand for America\u201d policy group.", "description": "Nikki Haley commended President Trump's foreign record, saying his accomplishments should make all Americans feel a deep sense of pride.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nikki-Haley-and-Donald-Trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
