Very rarely do I find a cab driver who doesn't need some kind of direction to get to my specific road.'\n\nConfirming he had drunk Pina Coladas earlier that day at Raymond Blanc's hotel, he said: 'It's a long standing joke that I have an Essex accent and Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses can only drink Pina Coladas so that's a drink that I would sometime have.\n\n'Plus I actually love the taste of Pina Coladas.'\n\nEarlier Beckwith claimed the woman had made 'untruthful and malicious' claims that he sexually assaulted her in her flat after accusing him of blocking her for promotion, which he said was 'ridiculous'.\n\nHe denied there was a 'hard-core drinking' culture at his team. He admits having sexual activity with the woman in the July incident but has branded her allegation of sexual assault a 'complete fabrication'.\n\nThe woman has admitted she was 'disappointed' about not being promoted to a higher pay grade in her first year after qualifying as an associate years before the alleged assaults.\n\nBeckwith told the tribunal that has an 'Essex accent' and likes the taste of Pina Coladas, just like David Jason's character in Only Fools and Horses (stock image)\n\nBeckwith said: 'It's ridiculous. I was a good appraisal partner and if my appraisees had concerns I would make sure I would listen to those concerns.\n\n'I don't recognise at all the suggestion that I was somehow underprepared for appraisals meetings or I was blocking promotion or whatever else that's being alleged.\n\n'I took the role seriously and I took the view that I was a good at the role. The bottom line is my thoughts about promotion and non-promotion were one of six partners in the team.\n\n'Actually as the youngest partner in the team, it was arguable that my view on someone was slightly less relevant than the more senior partners.\n\n'I will use that word, it's ridiculous.'\n\nHe told the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal that the pay rise she wanted was 'rare' a year after qualifying as an associate and that his team in the firm had a 'very collegiate' culture.\n\nHe said: 'Although it's possible for a newly qualified associate to work for a year and move up the gradings and be promoted, it's rare.'\n\nBeckwith denies breaching professional standards of failing to act with integrity and behaving in a way that brings his profession into public disrepute.\n\nThe hearing continues.", "description": "Ryan Beckwith, 41, is a partner at\u00a0Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP in London.
