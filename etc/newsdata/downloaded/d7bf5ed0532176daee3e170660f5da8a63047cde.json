It means we can decide our future together, we can take back control of our money, our borders, and our laws, together, and we will be able to do free trade agreements around the world. We can also build, after three-and-a-half years, our relations with our friends and partners in the EU.\u201d\n\nOn the upcoming vote in the House of Commons this weekend, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI have every confidence that when my colleagues in parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday and in succeeding days.\n\n\u201cThis is our chance in the UK, as democrats, to get Brexit done and come out on October 31st. This is our chance to focus on our priorities and the people\u2019s priorities: the NHS, putting 20,000 police on the streets, lifting up funding of education across the country, the biggest expansion of living wage. Those are things I think the people of this country want us to be focusing on in addition to Brexit.\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this now for three-and-a-half years and it hasn\u2019t always been an easy experience for the UK. It\u2019s been long, it\u2019s been painful, it\u2019s been divisive. And now is the moment for us as a country to come together, now is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this done to begin building a new and progressive partnership with our EU friends and with whom, of course, we share so many priorities.\u201d\n\n17:00 UPDATE \u2014 Johnson\u2019s position on Brexit is either \u2018this deal or no deal\u2019 as Juncker rules out extension\n\nA senior source speaking to Sky News has said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s position on Brexit is that the choice is either this new Brexit deal or leaving the EU in a clean break, affirming that there will be no delay.\n\nThe report comes as European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters that Brexit \u201chas to happen now\u201d and there will be no deadline extension.

We have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions.\u201d\n\nThe Commission chief wrote in his letter: \u201cAs regards the withdrawal agreement itself, negotiations focused on the protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland [ie, the backstop] and sought to identify a mutually satisfactory solution to address the specific circumstances on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cThe negotiators also discussed the political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Their aim was to adjust the political declaration in a way that reflects the different level of ambition now sought by the government of the United Kingdom for the country\u2019s future relationship with the European Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it is high time to complete the withdrawal process and move on, as swiftly as possible, to the negotiation on the European Union\u2019s future partnership with the United Kingdom,\u201d he added.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa Where there is a will, there is a #deal \u2013 we have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that #EUCO endorses this deal. pic.twitter.com/7AfKyCZ6k9 \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) October 17, 2019\n\nMr Juncker added that he recommends the EU27 endorse the deal during this week\u2019s European summit. If the other EU nation-leaders back the proposal, the agreement would go to the British parliament on Saturday for a vote.\n\nDoubt remains whether there is enough support in the House of Commons to pass a withdrawal agreement bill, with key player the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) sceptical that the deal in its current form was acceptable.\n\nSupport from the Northern Irish unionist party is key for the minority Conservative government. In a joint statement released on Thursday morning, before news of the agreed deal broke, DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds said that \u201cas things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT\u201d.\n\nMrs Foster and Mr Dodds added: \u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nPost-announcement, the DUP was reported to have said: \u201cRead our statement. It hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nSky's @skydavidblevins reports that the DUP is 'not on board' with the #Brexit deal Prime Minister @BorisJohnson has agreed with the EU.

In point one, the Eurocrat said that Northern Ireland will remain part of a \u201climited\u201d set of EU rules related to goods:\n\n1) Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU rules, notably related to goods. This means that all applicable procedures on goods will take place at the points entry into Northern Ireland and not across the island. For this purpose, UK authorities will be in charge of applying the Union\u2019s customs code in Northern Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland will stay in the UK\u2019s customs territory but also remain an entry point to the EU\u2019s Single Market. According to Mr Barnier:\n\n2) Northern Ireland will remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory. It will therefore beneift from the UK\u2019s future trade policy. But Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into our Single Market. UK authorities can apply tariffs on products coming from third countries \u2014 so long as those goods entering Northern Ireland are not at risk of entering our Single Market. For goods at risk of entering the Single Market, UK authorities will apply the EU\u2019s tariffs.\n\nOn the third point related to Value Added Tax (VAT), Mr Barnier said both sides have \u201cmaintained the integrity of the Single Market\u201d, but the deal will \u201calso satisfy the UK\u2019s wishes\u201d.\n\nMr Barnier confirmed in the fourth point that the DUP had lost its veto over whether new arrangements come into force in Northern Ireland; instead, a simple majority vote will be held in Stormont, the country\u2019s assembly. He said:\n\n4) Prime Minister Johnson and the Taoiseach wanted to ensure long-term democratic support for the application by UK authorities of relevant union rules in Northern Ireland. Four years after the enforcement of the protocol, the representives of Northern Ireland will be able to decide by simple majority whether to continue applying relevant union rules in Northern Ireland or not. This democratic support is a cornerstone of our newly-agreed approach.\n\n\"For me, since day one, what really matters are the people, the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland, what really matters is peace\" \u2013 Michel Barnier outlines the four key points in Brexit negotiations involving the island of Ireland\n\nLatest: https://t.co/0i3FYxs5uO pic.twitter.com/vZwps8G88l \u2014 BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) October 17, 2019\n\nFor reaction to the deal read here.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that a new Brexit deal has been brokered between the UK and the EU.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/BoJo2-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
