He deleted the tweets and apologized, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not something that I\u2019m proud of at all.\u201d\n\nStill, Anheuser-Busch announced it was severing ties with Mr. King, saying in a statement that his social media posts \u201cdo not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him. We are honoring our commitment by donating more than $350,000 to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.\u201d\n\nThe saga has brought scrutiny upon Mr. Calvin and The Register, which has defended digging up Mr. King\u2019s old posts. Executive editor Carol Hunter wrote a statement posing the question, \u201cThe jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts. Shouldn\u2019t that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King\u2019s cause or were planning to do so?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe counter arguments: The tweets were posted seven years ago, when King was 16. And he was remorseful. Should we chalk up the posts to a youthful mistake and omit the information?\u201d Ms. Hunter wrote. \u201cEventually, Register editors decided we would include the information, but at the bottom of the story. We thought we should be transparent about what we had found, but not highlight it at the top of the story or as a separate story.\u201d\n\nShe also said local media reports and Mr. King\u2019s apology came before The Register\u2019s profile was published, but critics have accused the paper of bringing the tweets to Busch\u2019s attention before its announcement to sever ties with him.\n\nUnmoved by The Register\u2019s explanation, Twitter sleuths went on to dig up old posts by Mr. Calvin dating from 2010 to 2013 that \u201cused a racist slur for black people, made light of abusing women, used the word \u2018gay\u2019 as a pejorative and mocked the legalization of same-sex marriage by saying he was \u2018totally going to marry a horse,\u2019\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nMr. Calvin has since deleted the tweets and posted an apolgoy Wednesday morning before locking his account, The Post reported.\n\n\u201cHey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive,\u201d he reportedly tweeted. \u201cI apologize for not holding myself to the same high standards as the Register holds others.\u201d\n\nThe Register has opened an investigation into Mr. Calvin\u2019s tweets, The Post reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
