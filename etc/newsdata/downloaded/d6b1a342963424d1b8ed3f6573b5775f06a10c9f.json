I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m \u2026 crying?\u201d\n\n\n\nIf that line spewed out of your mouth or raced through your mind during a sexual escapade, I can guess what next thought was: What happened?\n\n\u201cUsually, if we start crying during sex, especially as women, we try to immediately shut it down, like \u2018What the eff is happening?\u2019 or, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be crying right now \u2013 he\u2019s going to feel so uncomfortable,\u2019 or, \u2018What is wrong with me?\u2019\u201d says Rachel Wright, a licensed marriage and family therapist in York City. But \u201cwhile it may not be your favourite way to engage in sex,\u201d she adds, \u201ccrying is totally normal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because though crying is typically perceived as a sign of sadness, in reality it\u2019s your body saying \u201ctoo much!\u201d of any emotion, be it joy, fear, happiness or pain, says Laura McGuire, a sexologist in Florida. Wright actually calls crying \u201cemotional sweating\u201d. But like sweating, tears sometimes seem to pour out at the worst time.\n\nIf your partner seems confused, \u201cbeing honest is the best policy,\u201d says Dr Sarah Nasserzadeh, a psychosexual therapist in Palo Alto, California, and co-author of Orgasm Answer Guide. Yep, that means opening up about what you think triggered those tears \u2013 like one of the reasons below.\n\n1. Your hormones are off\n\nWhether you\u2019re PMS-ing hard, undergoing fertility treatment or pregnant, you know hormonal spikes, dips, and shifts can trigger a waterfall, and that\u2019s the case whether you\u2019re watching a commercial or spread-eagle in bed, says Dr Nasserzadeh.\n\nRead more: 6 incredible sensations your sex life is crying out for\n\n2. You\u2019re drunk\n\nThat last cocktail might have given you the liquid courage to ask a crush to walk you all the way home, but you can also curse it for lowering the inhibitions that typically keep your emotions close to your chest, Dr Nasserzadeh says.\n\n3. You\u2019re really relaxed\n\nKnow why sex can feel so good? Because the rest of the day (or week or month) you\u2019re tense and the deed forces you to relax.\n\n\"When sex is really good and we\u2019re completely relaxed for a few seconds \u2013sometimes minutes \u2013 it allows all these things to come out,\" McGuire says. It\u2019s the exact same reason you may cry during a massage or yoga class.\n\n4. You feel super-connected\n\nSometimes, there are no words for how deeply connected you feel to your partner. Instead, there are tears, Dr Nasserzadeh says. \u201cIf sex is a way of deep connection with a partner, your body might choose this form of release to communicate your emotions,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty typical, Wright adds, since sex releases oxytocin, and oxytocin promotes bonding, trust, and empathy. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel safe to release emotions that may have been bottled up for whatever reason,\u201d she says.\n\n5. You\u2019re grieving\n\nDid a relative or pet die recently? Or perhaps you got laid off or, heck, you\u2019re still not over your last breakup. Grief can strike anywhere \u2013 walking down the sidewalk, in the middle of work meeting, or, yep, mid-romp.\n\n6. It hurts\n\nYour partner may jump to this conclusion if you cry during sex and, sometimes, he or she is right. Painful sex may simply mean you need to slow down or grab some lube, or, if it happens frequently, may signal any number of (treatable) conditions like endometriosis, an infection, or pelvic inflammatory disease. Stop the session and schedule an appointment with a gynae stat.\n\nRead more: 3 common reasons why you sometimes feel sad after sex\n\n7. It hurts so good\n\nTears can also strike due to the type of pain you asked for in the form of (consensual) choking, spanking, slapping or getting tied up.\n\n\u201cBoth physical pain and pleasure activate the same part of the brain,\u201d Wright says, \u201cso it\u2019s totally possible to be crying from pain and be enjoying it at the same time.\u201d\n\n8. You\u2019re ashamed or feeling guilty\n\nDr Nasserzadeh has worked with women who tell her they\u2019ve cried during sex because they don\u2019t feel like they \u201cdeserve\u201d to take a moment to enjoy themselves. \u201cThey feel like, as a mother, they should be focusing on their child and not on self-pleasuring,\u201d she says.\n\nPSA though: You cannot take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling shame around sex or intimacy in general, and it comes out in the form of tears, it\u2019s a good indicator to explore that shame outside of the bedroom and see what it\u2019s about,\u201d Wright adds.\n\n9. You\u2019re so happy!\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve had a seriously long dry spell, or maybe sex just has never been that fun or enjoyable to you. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never had (or rarely had) satisfying sexual interactions, it might be so wonderful that tears would be a sign of gratitude, joy or happiness,\u201d Dr Nasserzadeh says. Let \u2018em flow, let \u2018em flow, let \u2018em flow!\n\n10. You\u2019re triggered\n\nMaybe you\u2019re a survivor of sexual assault, or maybe something a little off happened once that you thought you\u2019d forgotten. Cue sex to remind you. \u201cTrauma gets so deeply embedded in our minds and memory that it\u2019s hard to remember exactly what happened and something [sex] will bring it up,\u201d McGuire says. Stop having sex if you feel like your brain and body are dissociating, if painful memories are coming up, or you feel out of control, Wright advises.\n\nWhether or not you can put your finger on it, see a professional if \u201cyou\u2019re crying a lot and you\u2019re not able to identify why, or even if it\u2019s once but the feelings that are coming with that are sudden fear or a sudden sense of dread,\u201d McGuire suggests.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthmag.com\n\nImage credit: Shutterstock", "description": "Hey, it happens...", "authors": ["Anna Medaris Miller"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2920/2dcbed64ede343448de326c68396cb0d.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-21"}
