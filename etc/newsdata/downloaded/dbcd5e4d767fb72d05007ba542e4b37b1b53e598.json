Washington will face either the St. Louis Cardinals or Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe Cardinals entered the final day of the season with a one-game edge over the Brewers. If they end up tied, the teams would meet for the National League Central title Monday in St. Louis \u2014 with the loser flying to Washington after the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to play anybody, anywhere,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nMartinez noted Strasburg and Patrick Corbin are available out of the bullpen Tuesday. And if the Nationals win, Strasburg or Corbin could be ready to start Game 1 Thursday on the road against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
