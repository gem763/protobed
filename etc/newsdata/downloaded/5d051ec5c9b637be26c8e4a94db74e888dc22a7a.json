Shells thudded into buildings in the distance as Kurdish forces in vans prepared to race jets and sniper fire, trying to get to a battle that almost everyone else had left.\n\nThose who remained in the border town at the frontline of the war for north-eastern Syria were there to fight; the Kurds rallying to defend it and the Arabs preparing to seize it from them. Early on Saturday, the Arab force, trained by Turkey, made its move. By the day\u2019s end, the proxies claimed to have recaptured part of Ras al-Ayn, making good on Ankara\u2019s threats to push Kurdish forces from one of their main enclaves.\n\nAt the same time, US troops, who once trained the same Arabs before more recently fighting alongside the Kurds against Islamic State (Isis), were preparing to exit Syria for good, their five-year war against the terror group at an end. So, too, was their relationship with their hosts.\n\nThe bewildering events of last week may have seemed like chess moves to some: considered manoeuvres made in awareness of the consequences. To others, including European leaders now scrambling to pick up the pieces and Kurds now looking for a rescuer, Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abandon an ally on the eve of their being invaded was an impulsive act likely to change the course of the region.\n\nIn the heartland of Syria\u2019s Kurds, old alliances are fast being trampled by new realities that bear no resemblance to the last five years of war. From this point, the Kurds who have shouldered the fight against the global menace of Isis will need to fend for themselves; the US, which historically took a lead stake in how things unfolded in the Middle East, has effectively left the stage, and Turkey \u2013 long rattled by the ascendancy of Syria\u2019s Kurds \u2013 aims to re-engineer the border\u2019s demographics.\n\nWhat all this may end up unleashing is preoccupying London, Paris and other western capitals which, like the Kurds, are grappling to come to terms with a vastly diminished US role and the vacuum it creates. What it may mean for ethnic coexistence in the region is now also being questioned: Arabs fighting Kurds for land adds another dimension to the chaos of the Syrian war, as does a demographic realignment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An explosion in the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn, which Turkish forces were attempting to capture.

Such seismic shifts also continue to ripple through north-eastern Syria, where the relative post-Isis calm of recent months has given way to a new wave of existential fears, perhaps worse than those that have plagued Kurds for centuries. \u201cHow can this happen to us?\u201d said Kawa Otthman, 27. \u201cWe fought for them and they gave us their word. We thought it was different this time.\u201d\n\nThe shift has been drastic, all the more so for being so sudden. Only one week ago, officials in the province, known locally as Rojava, were calibrating how to deepen their relationship with the US. Now, with Washington\u2019s diplomats and troops ordered to leave, the sense of abandonment is palpable. In the regional capital of Qamishli on Saturday Syrian government troops guarded a neighbourhood that had remained loyal to Damascus throughout the country\u2019s civil war. \u201cWe need to speak to Bashar,\u201d said one man, of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, as he waited to buy fruit at the market. \u201cWho else will protect us from the Turks now?\u201d\n\nThe US presence in Rojava had been seen by Kurds as a buffer between them and Turkey. To Ankara, though, by being in north-eastern Syria and partnering with the Kurds, the US had given an avowed enemy cover to further a project that had little to do with fighting Isis, and instead gave impetus to a four-decade insurgency inside its borders.\n\nKurds honour their battle dead on billboards placed near main roads on the approaches to towns. Across the top of each are photos of men and women from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), their affiliations made clear by the organisation\u2019s red flag.\n\nOver the course of the Syrian civil war, the PKK has consolidated its presence in the affairs of the northeast and its members dominate senior administrative and military positions. In 2015, when US officials struck a partnership with Syrian Kurds to fight Isis, the PKK was supportive and had remained so ever since.\n\nThe pact, called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), drew in large numbers of Kurdish fighters, along with some Arab units. Together, they acted as ground troops for the US air force, ousting Isis from its remaining lands, while suffering close to 11,000 casualties.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish-backed Syrian rebels and Turkish soldiers watch as smoke billows from the border town of Ras al-Ayn on Saturday.

As the war\u2019s newest refugees escape, the bones of Turkey\u2019s border plan are starting to take shape. Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn are both seen as hubs in which Syrian Arabs currently exiled in Turkey could be relocated, at the expense of Kurdish populations currently living there.\n\nNear the border on Saturday, thuds of artillery rounds and machine-gun fire regularly shook the still, hot air. On the Turkish side, soldiers lined the road south waiting for the arrival of S\u00fcleyman Soylu, the interior minister, to claim the first significant Turkish victory in the operation. His arrival may have been premature: Abu Mukdad, a field commander with the rebel Syrian national army, said that his men were only in control of 15% of the town as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nWe all used to live together as neighbours. Now they will put strangers in our homes\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a difficult time because there is intense resistance from [Kurdish forces],\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no civilians left but this may still take one more day.\u201d\n\nTurkish TV channels broadcast footage of men from the Syrian divisions using their rifles to smash pictures of the jailed PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan and tearing down pictures of martyred SDF soldiers inside the town. The Kurdish-led fighters appeared to hold out in the town\u2019s outskirts as bombing continued.\n\nRas al-Ayn\u2019s capture would mean Turkey could try to cut the road from the eastern Kurdish city Qamishli, the de facto capital, to all the other Kurdish positions west along the border.\n\nA Kurdish woman in the Turkish border town of Viran\u015fehir, originally from Ras al-Ayn, burst into tears watching the carnage unfold from her living room television set. \u201cThat was my neighbourhood and my house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all I had left and now it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nThe small town was home to a diverse mix of Kurdish, Arab, Circassian and Armenian communities before the war began, she said. Now, if Erdo\u011fan sends Arab families from elsewhere in Syria to repopulate the border zone as planned, she fears she will never be able to return.\n\n\u201cThe [Syrian rebels] will never protect the Kurds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all used to live together as neighbours and now they will put strangers in our homes.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mohammed Rasool and Hussein Akkosh", "description": "In the Kurdish heartlands in Syria, the sense of abandonment at the withdrawal of US troops is palpable as Erdo\u011fan\u2019s forces claim early successes", "authors": ["Martin Chulov", "Bethan Mckernan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e86943ca460abbcd2bf85f0065ea393e8ff73eb1/0_411_4238_2544/master/4238.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c8ae878042e3c42dcd8278248c9021a", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
