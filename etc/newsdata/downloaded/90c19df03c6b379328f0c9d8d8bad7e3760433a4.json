Just ask Senate majority leader Harry Reid; or his son Key, formerly a registered lobbyist with Patton Boggs LLP and Lionel Sawyer & Collins; or his son-in-law Steve Barringer, a registered lobbyist, formerly with MGN Inc. and currently with Holland and Hart LLP ; or his son Rory, who was elected to the Clark County (Nevada) Commission in 2002 and was the Democrats\u2019 gubernatorial candidate in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitico noted that \u201cReid has one daughter and four sons, all of whom are at least tangentially involved in Nevada politics,\u201d but that\u2019s surely coincidental. And when Reid\u2019s campaign bought nearly $17,000 in merchandise from his granddaughter\u2019s jewelry business, it was surely because her gifts were the best possible choice on their own merits.#ad#\n\nOr you can ask House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, or her daughter, political consultant and DNC member Christine Pelosi, currently the California Democratic Party Women\u2019s Caucus chairwoman and member of the San Francisco Giants Community Board of Directors.\n\nOr you can ask her son, Paul Pelosi Jr. The right-wing site Gawker noted that Pelosi Jr.\u2019s LinkedIn page . . . pointedly omits his $180,000-a-year job as a senior vice president at InfoUSA, a marketer of consumer databases, which he started less than one month after his mother became House speaker, while simultaneously holding his job at Countrywide. InfoUSA CEO Vinod Gupta also paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars as a consultant, so many suspected Pelosi\u2019s job was an attempt to win influence with Nancy Pelosi. Paul Pelosi\u2019s explanation: He got to know Gupta as a client for whom he refinanced a house, and his experience as an investment banker was useful in evaluating acquisitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can ask Vice President Joe Biden or his son Beau Biden, currently the attorney general of Delaware and a declared candidate for governor in 2016. Or you can ask the vice president\u2019s other son, Hunter Biden, whom President Clinton appointed to two separate positions in the Department of Commerce and who then was appointed by President Bush to the board of directors of Amtrak and who currently is chairman of the World Food Program USA and a partner at Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC and is counsel to Boies, Schiller, Flexner LLP, a New York\u2013based law firm.\n\nOr you can ask the House assistant Democratic leader, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina. Or you can ask his daughter, Mignon Clyburn, currently serving as acting chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission. President Obama appointed her to the FCC in 2009, after she spent eleven years as a member of the Public Service Commission (PSC) of South Carolina. Or you can ask his son-in-law Cecil Hannibal, paid $55,350 for \u201ccampaign outreach\u201d by Clyburn\u2019s campaign in the 2010 cycle , or his cousin William Clyburn Jr., head of Clyburn Consulting LLC, which describes its role as \u201c[making] the connection from possibility to actuality by understanding the issues and building strong relationships.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s much discussion in Washington of creating an \u201copportunity society\u201d; that term is in fact a pretty good description of life for the offspring of lawmakers, as opportunities abound \u2014 campaign work, jobs in congressional offices, campaign committees, political action committees, lobbying firms, and the occasional steered earmark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012, the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington examined the publicly disclosed financial ties to family members and found:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201082 members (40 Democrats and 42 Republicans) paid family members through their congressional offices, campaign committees, and political action committees;\n\n\u201044 members (20 Democrats and 24 Republicans) have family members who lobby or are employed in government affairs;\n\n\u201090 members (42 Democrats and 48 Republicans) have paid a family business, employer, or associated nonprofit;\n\n\u201020 members (13 Democrats and seven Republicans) used their campaign money to contribute to a family member\u2019s political campaign;\n\n\u201014 members (six Democrats and eight Republicans) charged interest on personal loans they made to their own campaigns;\n\n\u201038 members (24 Democrats and 14 Republicans) earmarked to a family business, employer, or associated nonprofit.\n\nOnly a true cynic would doubt that all of the above individuals reached those positions on their own merits or claim that organizations and institutions brought on these children of lawmakers in order to establish a connection or curry favor with their parents. That\u2019s . . . aristocratic.\n\nSome might dismiss the denial of an aristocracy and suggest all of these familial connections are troubling. They might even argue that the governing of the U.S. is now dominated by a small group of powerful families, some allied, some rivals, in a system more fit for Game of Thrones than a constitutional republic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good news is the issue will surely be discussed and resolved by a 2016 presidential race featuring Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush; we can all look forward to the MSNBC coverage from Ronan Farrow, Luke Russert, and Abby Huntsman.\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot on NRO.
