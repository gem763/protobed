The most important parts of that system are the presumption of innocence and trial by jury, so I\u2019d like you to remember that Michelle is presumed innocent and she should be,\u201d Andrew Bowman, her attorney, said outside court Thursday. \u201cWe are prepared to let judgement rest in a jury\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Stamford Advocate, Troconis faces an additional charge of tampering with evidence\u2014a day after state police arrested Jennifer\u2019s estranged husband, Fotis Dulos, on the same charge. Dulos, 52, is currently out on a $500,000 bond and is expected to return to court on Sept. 12.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exhausting fight. I love my children, that\u2019s about it,\u201d Fotis Dulos told reporters as he left the Connecticut State Police station on Wednesday.\n\nJennifer Dulos, 50, was last seen on May 24 after dropping off her five kids at school. Authorities later found her car abandoned on a New Canaan road. Inside her house, investigators found \u201cmultiple stains\u201d on the floor and a car inside her garage that \u201ctested positive for human blood,\u201d court documents said.\n\n\u201cInvestigators came to the consensus that a serious physical assault had occurred at the scene, and Jennifer Dulos was the suspected victim,\u2019\u2019 the June court affidavit said, adding that there were \u201cmultiple areas of blood splatter\u201d and other \u201cevidence of attempts to clean the crime scene.\u201d\n\nAt the time, authorities said, Troconis was Fotis Dulos\u2019 live-in girlfriend as the couple was in the middle of a bitter divorce and custody battle over the children. Prosecutors previously alleged the couple dumped several trash bags containing items soaked with Jennifer\u2019s blood in the hours after she was reported missing.\n\nDulos and Troconis were arrested and pleaded not guilty in June to hindering prosecution and tampering with evidence charges.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Fotis Dulos was re-arrested for allegedly cleaning up a red Toyota pickup truck, belonging to one of his contracting employees, five days after his wife went missing.\n\nAuthorities allege the father of five was \u201clying in wait\u201d at Jennifer\u2019s home before the crime was committed between 8:05 a.m. and 10:25 a.m. on May 24.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to see why the state waited for months to serve this warrant. It was unnecessary,\u201d Dulos\u2019 lawyer Norm Pattis said in a statement. \u201cWe wish the state police spent more time looking for Jennifer and less trying to build a case against Fotis.\u201d\n\nAccording to an arrest warrant obtained by The Daily Beast, Troconis met with investigators for a third time on Aug. 13, at which point she admitted \u201cshe had not been truthful\u201d in her prior two interviews.\n\nShe told investigators that Fotis had the truck washed because \u201cJennifer at some point was in there\u201d and had seen the \u201cstained towel he had been using to clean the truck,\u201d according to his arrest warrant. State police confirmed the truck had a \u201cblood-like substance\u201d that contained Jennifer\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe 44-year-old also told police that she did not see her boyfriend when she woke up around 6:40 a.m. the day Jennifer went missing\u2014despite previously saying the coupled shared a shower that morning.\n\nThe new arrest warrant also reveals state police found handwritten notes inside their home two days after their arrest which specified times and activities the couple were allegedly doing the day on May 24. The notes included specific activities, times, incoming and outgoing phone calls and alibis that were later proven incorrect, the warrant said.", "description": "Last month, Michelle Troconis told investigators \u201cshe had not been truthful\u201d in her previous police interviews.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567718689/Jennifer_Dulos_case_2_kz65y2", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
