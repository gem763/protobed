After a game, angry fans can go in, shut the door and release their pent-up frustration by smashing a bunch of objects. The crushable objects in the room can include everything from the logos of the team the Flyers just played to more random everyday items like televisions, plates, glasses, guitars and mirrors.\n\n\u201cThe concept is definitely one-of-a-kind and non-traditional,\u201d Valerie Camillo, president of business operations of the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe ran the concept by some of our fans who told us they thought this would be a fresh way to have some harmless fun. I had never heard of a rage room before the design team pitched the idea. Now, I can\u2019t wait to get in there and take a few whacks.\u201d\n\nNon-ragers can get in on the action by standing back and watching people smash the objects.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Philadelphia Flyers install a room in their arena for fans to rage after a game.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/ad5f4822-Philadelphia20Flyers.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
