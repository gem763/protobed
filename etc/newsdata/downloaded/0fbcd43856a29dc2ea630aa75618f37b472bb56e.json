They are the perfect partner to help us achieve our goal to establish Critizr as Europe\u2019s leader in feedback management for retail.\u2019\n\nLaurel Bowden of 83North added: \u2018Customer experience at storefront level is critical for retail success. We are very impressed how Critizr empowers store managers, in their daily routine with the right tools, and as a result, has significant impact on some of the most important business metrics such as revenue, NPS, purchase frequency and churn\u2019.\n\nCritizr currently partners with over 80 of Europe\u2019s biggest companies in 25 countries across retail, banking, travel, entertainment and hospitality, and in France alone, it connects to over 30,000 points of sale. As the retail economy shifts from transactional to experiential, brands with a better customer experience have been proven to achieve 1.5 times more sales than their competitors.\n\nCustomer dissatisfaction cost companies \u20ac102 billion in 2017 (Accenture strategy study) with one of the key challenges identified as a lack of employee involvement in the customer experience.\n\nNicolas Hammer continued: \u2018The Critizr solution hands the keys to customer-centricity to front line teams, making them more agile and effective. This local empowerment is the key to our success, since I believe it is the only way to deliver a better customer experience in business.\n\n\u201cOur experience with leading brands across Europe proves the positive results of transforming all employees into powerful customer champions in their own outlet.\u2019", "description": "", "authors": ["Alara Basul", "Online Editor Uktn"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
