The Taliban said they had targeted a convoy of foreign forces.\n\nBut the victims were civilians, said Nasrat Rahimi, a spokesman for the interior ministry, without giving details.\n\nOn Monday, a truck bomb exploded close to a compound housing foreigners killing at least 16 people and injuring more than 100, an attack that was also claimed by the Taliban.\n\nThe recent attacks have highlighted fears that US negotiations with the Taliban will not end the daily violence in Afghanistan and its terrible toll on civilians.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The view from Lashkar Gah province on whether peace with the Taliban is possible\n\nMeanwhile, nine former top US diplomats warned that Afghanistan could collapse into a \"total civil war\" if President Donald Trump withdrew all American forces before a peace deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban.\n\nThe group - which included five former ambassadors to Kabul, a former special envoy to Afghanistan and a former deputy secretary of state - said a \"major troop withdrawal must be contingent on a final peace\".\n\n\"The initial US drawdown should not go so far or so fast that the Taliban believe that they can achieve military victory. In that case, they will not make compromises for peace with other Afghan political forces,\" they said.\n\nThe text, published on the website of the Atlantic Council think tank, came after Mr Khalilzad outlined the deal with the Taliban, reached after nine rounds of peace talks that have been held in the Gulf state of Qatar.\n\nIn exchange for the US troop withdrawal, the militants would ensure that Afghanistan would never again be used as a base for militant groups seeking to attack the US and its allies.\n\nThe US currently has about 14,000 troops in the country.\n\nBut presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said the government was concerned about the consequences of the deal and that the authorities wanted more information about the risks it posed.\n\nMany in Afghanistan fear that a US-Taliban deal could see hard-won rights and freedoms eroded. The militants enforced strict religious laws and treated women brutally under their rule from 1996 to 2001.", "description": "The latest attack highlights fears that US talks with the Taliban will not end the violence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1664/production/_108623750_815b0627-abbc-41ac-882a-4dedfc593e44.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
