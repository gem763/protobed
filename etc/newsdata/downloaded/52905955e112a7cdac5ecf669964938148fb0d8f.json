May she rest in peace.\u2019\n\nIt is unclear whether other pre-recorded episodes will be aired over the coming weeks.\n\nNight of Hate Comments premiered in June and saw Sulli, Shin Dong Yup, Kim Sook, Kim Jong Min and a celebrity guest facing malicious comments head-on by reading them on the show and responding to them directly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSulli \u2013 who previously went on hiatus from f(x) after admitting to struggling with trolling \u2013 discussed how she learned not to worry about what others were saying about her.\n\nSpeaking on the show, she explained: \u2018I think that if I worry too much about what other people think of me, then it will be too difficult to find my own self. Because I would get influenced by everyone. I do work at it, but ever since I was young, I hated seeing myself obsess about what others thought of me.\n\nSulli is suspected to have taken her own life (Picture: EPA/YONHAP)\n\n\u2018Years ago, I was practicing dance in the practice room. It was so tiring that everyone began dancing half-heartedly. But then someone who was high up in the company came to the room to watch. Everyone started working really hard. Even though just a few minutes ago, they were just going through the motions, they suddenly started working hard. I hated seeing that. So I kept dancing half-heartedly.\u2019\n\nSulli, real name Choi Jin-ri, also addressed the abuse she would get when she posted pictures in which she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra under her top.\n\nThe Goblin singer said: \u2018Going braless is one\u2019s freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Bras have wires; they are not good for health. Not wearing one is comfortable. That is something beautiful and natural. For me, a bra is like an accessory. Some outfits go with it, and others do not. That\u2019s why I sometimes do not wear a bra.\n\n\u2018When I upload my photos without a bra, people talk about it a lot. I could have been scared. But I didn\u2019t because I thought it would be nice if more people could discard their prejudices. I want to step outside the box, tell people (not wearing a bra) is not a big thing.\u2019\n\nWhile JTBC have cancelled Night of Hate Comments, a number of K-pop artists have also suspended their activities in light of Sulli\u2019s death, including SuperM, Super Junior and Sulli\u2019s former bandmate Amber Liu.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
