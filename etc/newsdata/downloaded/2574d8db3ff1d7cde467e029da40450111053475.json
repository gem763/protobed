Tears rolled down my cheeks. I almost wet my pants,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to tell the Japanese team that I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have faith in them.\u201d\n\nThe Brave Blossoms had never before beaten Ireland, a team who were ranked world number one just a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing was they played the game believing they will win, although people including me, did not really think they stood a chance,\u201d said 63-year-old retiree Tomoyoshi Ito.\n\nUniversity professor Shunichi Takekawa said he had just become a rugby fan.\n\n\u201cThe form they showed in withstanding Ireland\u2019s fierce attack was impressive. I want them to make it to the finals.\u201d", "description": "Japanese rugby fans were still in disbelief on Sunday, a day after the Rugby World Cup host team beat champion contender Ireland in an electrifying upset.", "authors": ["Kiyoshi Takenaka", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435111146&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S04F", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
