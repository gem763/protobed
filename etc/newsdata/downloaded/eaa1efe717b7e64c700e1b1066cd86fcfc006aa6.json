It\u2019s been the weakest week I\u2019ve seen on the show for many years. Next week will be much better when back to normal you watch!!!'\n\nOn Alex. he added: 'Not as good as last week but still a dance that suited her. Neil is a very clever boy with his choreography.\n\nChange of plan: Fellow professional dancer Kevin Clifton stepped in at the last minute to take Neil's place, performing in front of judges alongside contestant Alex Scott\n\nChoice: James has revealed that he believes producers should have selected Gorka M\u00e1rquez, who wasn't assigned a celebrity partner this year, as Neil's replacement\n\n'Under the circumstances I think she did well but still looks very awkward at time. When she goes back to Ballroom & Latin I think she\u2019s in trouble. #Score 7 MAX.'\n\nJames's thoughts on Gorka as a replacement for Neil come after the Spanish dancer himself, who was left without a celebrity partner this series, hinted that he should have been the one to step in on Saturday night's show.\n\nThe hunky ballroom sensation retweeted several comments from fans who condemned Kevin being called back into the ballroom after he was ousted from the competition with partner Anneka Rice, 61.\n\nAt the beginning of the show, host Tess Daly announced that Neil would be missing the show after suffering an injury earlier in the day, with Kevin stepping into his shoes.\n\nSharing opinions: James took to Twitter as the show aired to share his broad range of opinions\n\nCritique: Not one to mince words, James went on to brand the week's dance routines 'the weakest... for many years', while also stating that Alex was on potentially shaky ground\n\nBut Gorka didn't appear to agree with the decision as he later took to Twitter to retweet the s comments which suggested that he should've been asked to step in.\n\nGorka, alongside other pro Graziano Di Prima, wasn't assigned a celebrity partner this year, and instead has just been taking part in group dances.\n\nThough he didn't say so directly himself, the dancer heavily suggested through his retweets that he didn't believe that last year's winner Kevin was the man for the job.\n\nThe star retweeted several fan remarks, including one which read: 'For real @gorkamarquez1 would of been PERFECT to dance with Alex tonight since Neil couldn\u2019t due to injury!!! Safe to say Gorka deserves a lot of appreciation!'\n\nSuffering: Neil Jones (pictured in the VT filmed before he suffered the injury) pulled out just hours ahead of the live show, but still took to Twitter to praise Alex's performance\n\nPraise: After making his announcement, he praised Alex and Kevin for their efforts on the show\n\nAnother stated: 'Really missing @gorkamarquez1 having a partner on this years #Strictly also surely if someone is injured he should be the stand in? Not someone who has already had a partner and been voted out? Xxx.'\n\n'Why have extra pros and not use them. Ermmmm hello @gorkamarquez1 deserved it not Kevin who has already had a partner this year,' remarked a third fan.\n\nWrote another: 'So we\u2019re all in agreement that it should be @gorkamarquez1 dancing tonight, right? Like the whole point is that him & @GrazianoDiPrima are there to step in as replacements if one of the other male pros get injured! #Strictly.'\n\nMailOnline have contacted representative of Gorka for comment.\n\nGiven the circumstances of their performance, Alex and Kevin were the last pair to take to the stage, as they danced a Couples Choice Street Dance to the iconic Ghostbusters Theme Song.\n\nSomething to say? Meanwhile, Gorka has hinted that he should have replaced injured Neil\n\nHint: Though he didn't say so directly himself, the Spanish hunk heavily suggested through his retweets that he didn't believe that last year's winner Kevin was the man for the job\n\nAs the dance came to an end, Kevin proudly spoke out in support of Alex for handling the last-minute change so well.\n\nHe said to the audience and the judges: 'It's difficult enough having a routine in four days when you've never danced a step before, but then teaching a professional how to do it in about 45 minutes. People can see I got a few things wrong in that but Alex kept the whole thing going.'\n\nAlex's solid performance also earned a positive reception from the judging panel, who agreed that it was her best dance yet.\n\nMotsi Mabuse gushed: 'Alex I have to give it to you! I have to say I just watched you there, shouting at Kevin, changing a partner getting it on performing, really honestly that was a great performance for you. Your skills are just double what we've had since the beginning.'\n\nDrama: Given the circumstances of their performance, Alex and Kevin were the last pair to take to the stage, as they danced a Couples Choice Street Dance to the iconic Ghostbusters Theme\n\nBruno Tonioli added: 'I've never had so much fun with ghosts ever, talk about delivering under pressure this was your best dance ever.'\n\nAlex's hard work paid off with a respectable 34 points out of 40, which also marked her highest score of the series so far.\n\nFollowing the dance, Strictly champion and Kevin's now-girlfriend Stacey Dooley took to Twitter to praise him for handling the last-minute change so well.\n\nTaking to Twitter Stacey appeared close to tears as she beamed with pride, saying in a video: 'Yes Kev yes! That's why he's the damn king he had 40 minutes to learn that routine I'm so proud.'\n\nNeil also tweeted: 'I'm gutted tonight I won't be able to dance because I was injured earlier today but I know @AlexScott ill smash it tonight, she's worked hard all week and she's in safe hands with @kevinclifton #strictly #teamred.'", "description": "Taking to Twitter as he watched the TV hit over the weekend, James - who was cut from Strictly back in 2014 - opined: 'Shame they didn't use Gorka to step in for Neil\u2026'", "authors": ["Ryan Smith For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20259138-0-image-a-73_1572218553649.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
