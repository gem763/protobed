That\u2019s exactly what happens in The Vast of Night, the feature debut of director Andrew Patterson, which blends elements of The Twilight Zone and Orson Welles\u2019 War of the Worlds in a taut, captivating alien invasion film told in real-time.\n\nSet during the 1950s in a small New Mexico town, a young radio DJ named Everett (Jake Horowitz) and a switchboard operator named Faye (Sierra McCormick) walk around town testing out Faye\u2019s new tape recorder. Most of the town is watching the high school basketball game. As the night progresses, Faye and Everett\u2019s knowledge of tape recorders and recordings becomes increasingly significant when a strange noise begins appearing all over town, including as distortions on Faye\u2019s phone lines and on Everett\u2019s radio station (WOTW, of course).\n\nEverett and Faye team up to figure the origin of the mysterious sound. At this point in the film, Patterson is a maestro with the camera. From long, slow, steady tracking shots following Everett and Faye around, to locked-off, perfectly still single takes of long monologues, the camerawork will have you on the edge of your seat. One scene in particular \u2014 a single tracking shot that goes on for several minutes as the camera races all over town, in and out of buildings \u2014 feels almost impossible. And yet it, like the rest of the film\u2019s dynamic camera work, drives the tension of the film. Something is out there. What could it be? What does it want?\n\nPhone...home? (Image: Fantastic Fest)\n\nAs Everett and Faye, Horowitz and McCormick melt into their \u201850s personas, desperately running around town, trying to figure out what\u2019s causing this damn sound. As they go from character to character and setting to setting, ramping up excitement, we never feel a disconnect form their distinct personalities or the wide-eyed wonder of the era.\n\nInterestingly, though the film has a very realistic, grounded look and feel, at every turn Patterson fights against that and reminds us we\u2019re watching a movie. The most jarring way he does this is by continually shifting to a square aspect ratio and distorting the visuals, making it feel like we\u2019re watching this story unfold on an old TV like it\u2019s some grand, 90-minute episode of The Twilight Zone.\n\nThe combined realism and fantasy of the filmmaking makes it seem like anything is possible in The Vast of Night. Horowitz and McCormick could be playing Everett and Faye in this movie or they could be playing actors playing characters named Everett and Faye on a TV show. We just don\u2019t know. Nor does it matter.\n\nWhat matters is the mystery. The crazy possibilities. For a while, the characters think the sound is coming from the Russians, which makes sense within the time period. But as new information is uncovered and more secrets unveiled, it becomes pretty clear that either everyone walking around this quiet town is crazy or there\u2019s something otherworldly in the sky.\n\nPatterson\u2019s filmmaking prowess is definitely the main attraction in The Vast of Night, but his broad ideas end up being a little bit stifled by his setting. With the old cars, switchboards, small town setting, and the ticking clock of that basketball game \u2014 the result is a film bursting at the seams with ideas and details that very nearly, but don\u2019t quite, reach their potential.\n\nThere\u2019s a payoff to be sure, but because that payoff is basically what you\u2019re expecting based on everything you\u2019ve seen so far, it leaves the film feeling just a tiny bit underwhelming. But just a bit. The Vast of Night is so beautiful and engaging, it makes us want more. But it is pretty incredible as is and makes us yearn to see what Patterson will do next.\n\nThe Vast of Night recently played Fantastic Fest 2019 and Amazon Studios bought the rights to the film. A 2020 release date is expected.", "description": "The whole world can change in the time it takes to play a high school basketball game.
