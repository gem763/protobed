De Gea strained a muscle adductor on international duty with Spain and is also unlikely to be available. However, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are all in line to return to the starting eleven.\n\nThere is an outside chance Alisson may return in goal for Liverpool having stepped up his rehabilitation over the international break. Mohamed Salah is a minor doubt after sustaining an ankle injury during Liverpool\u2019s win over Leicester, but is expected to make the starting line-up. Xherdan Shaqiri is a doubt with a calf injury while Nathaniel Clyne remains a long-term absentee.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nLiverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Milner; Salah, Firmino, Mane.\n\nManchester United XI: Romero; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Lindelof, Shaw; McTominay, Matic, Pereira; James, Mata, Rashford.\n\nWhen is it?\n\nThe match kicks off at Old Trafford at 4:30pm on Sunday 20 October (BST).\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League with coverage beginning at 3pm.\n\nOdds\n\nManchester United 4/1\n\nDraw 3/1\n\nLiverpool 4/6", "description": "Manchester United welcome Premier League leaders Liverpool to Old Trafford on Sunday as the two rivals renew hostilities.\u00a0 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2018s side are on a miserable run of form, having taken just a point from their last two league matches, including defeats to West Ham and Newcastle.\u00a0 United are currently just two points above the relegation zone and will be without both", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/20/15/jurgen-klopp-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
