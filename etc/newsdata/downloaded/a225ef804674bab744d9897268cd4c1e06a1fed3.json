The summit had been called by Mr. Trump on the basis of the outline of a deal \u2014 not an agreement \u2014 that had been negotiated by Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\nWhen the Taliban killed the fourth U.S. soldier in Afghanistan in two weeks, the Camp David summit was cancelled. Mr. Trump has since ordered an acceleration of military action against the Taliban which may be intended to force the Taliban to negotiate and compromise. To do so, our military action would have to inflict vastly more damage on it than it has in 18 years of war.\n\nIn 1969, President Nixon called for the \u201cVietnamization\u201d of that war, to turn over responsibility for fighting to South Vietnamese forces. In 2002, President George W. Bush defined our goal for Afghanistan in the same terms as Nixon had set for \u201cVietnamization.\u201d Many of us cringed because Mr. Bush had forgotten history and condemned us to repeat it. What is playing out regarding Afghanistan today is, with the exception we\u2019ll get to in a minute, precisely what happened regarding Vietnam in 1973-75.\n\nIn the last Democratic debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that she\u2019d withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan, deal or no deal. Former Vice President Joe Biden said that U.S. troops should come home except for bases in Pakistan. (We have none, and the Pakistanis will never permit us to establish any.)\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned about Afghanistan, from Afghanistan, it\u2019s that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.\u201d He evidently doesn\u2019t know that after the 9-11 attacks, when President Bush gave the Taliban the choice between surrendering bin Laden to us and war, they chose war.\n\nThe situation in Afghanistan doesn\u2019t allow for that sort of ignorance and timorous thinking.\n\nThe Taliban are not defeated either kinetically or ideologically. Until their ideology is defeated, the Taliban cannot be defeated and no peace deal with them can be devised by which they will abide.\n\nThe Taliban are stronger now than at any point since 9-11. They control or contest control of most of Afghanistan and reportedly have as many as 100,000 fighters in the field. Al Qaeda, still the Taliban\u2019s close ally, is resurgent there as is ISIS.\n\nThe Taliban are supplied and funded significantly by Russia and, to a lesser extent, by China and Iran. A few days after Mr. Trump cancelled the Camp David summit with them, \u201cTaliban negotiators\u201d went to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s envoy for Afghanistan purportedly to ask the Russians to push us back into negotiations. Baloney. The Russian-Taliban talks were about sustaining Russian aid to increase the Taliban\u2019s war-fighting capability.\n\nPakistan\u2019s army and its ISI intelligence service have, since before 9-11, been the Taliban\u2019s most trusted ally, providing money, training, intelligence and safe havens.\n\nThere are now about 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan and about 5,000 coalition troops. Mr. Trump wants to pull all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan before the 2020 election, but he declared the talks \u201cdead\u201d after the abortive attempt at a summit meeting with the Taliban at Camp David.\n\nWe will soon withdraw from Afghanistan under President Trump or his successor. The Taliban will defeat the Kabul government quickly and re-establish their \u201cIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan\u201d as a safe haven from which Islamic terror networks will mount attacks on the West, on India and other nations.\n\nThat is the big difference between Afghanistan and Vietnam. The Taliban are a religiously-motivated enemy whose ideology will continue to propel them \u2014 and those to whom they give safe haven \u2014 to attack us. The North Vietnamese, driven by nationalism and Communist ideology, had no motive to carry their war back to the United States.\n\nSo where do we go from here? Because Mr. Trump wants to escape the \u201cendless war\u201d that nation-building creates, he knows it would be an enormous mistake for him to follow the path set by Mr. Bush. The other options are better but neither will deliver the end of our war in Afghanistan.\n\nThe least bad option, as I have written before, is to withdraw U.S. and coalition ground troops, leaving behind enough special forces, intelligence assets and air power to detect and interdict terrorist operations against us. That commitment will have to continue indefinitely.\n\nThe worst option is Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s, to withdraw our troops quickly and regardless of the circumstances. She would abandon the Kabul government to rapid conquest by the Taliban. America and our allies will be threatened and attacked by the terrorist networks that will have safe havens there. Not only will we suffer those attacks \u2014 as bad or worse than 9-11 \u2014 but we will have to go back into Afghanistan again and again, forever more.\n\nWe mustn\u2019t conclude, as Ms. Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have, that even if war is forced upon us, as it was on 9-11, we shouldn\u2019t fight. The lesson of Vietnam is that if you don\u2019t fight a war in a manner calculated to win it decisively, you will lose it inevitably. As it was then, so it is now.\n\n\u2022 Jed Babbin, a deputy undersecretary of Defense in the George H.W.
