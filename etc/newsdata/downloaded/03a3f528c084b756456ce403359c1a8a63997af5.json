Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, to secure what he would call in another text message the \u201cdeliverable\u201d sought by Trump: a public statement from Ukraine that it would investigate corruption, including mentioning Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, by name. In exchange for the statement, the president would grant Ukraine\u2019s new president a coveted White House audience.", "description": "The Post reports that he will tell Congress there was a quid pro quo \u2014 thought not a \"corrupt\" one, according to a person close to him.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jLEk9u05vcUjSGkw5GIr6bq-7eI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMVJ6THNCEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
