Tuesday\u2019s gigantic parade in Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic looked like something out of the late Brezhnev era: endless military pomp and gray old men. Hong Kong is in its fourth straight month of protests, marked and stained by this week\u2019s shooting of an unarmed teenage demonstrator. The Chinese economy is growing at its slowest rate in 27 years, even when going by the overstated official figures.\n\nMeantime, capital is fleeing China \u2014 an estimated $1.2 trillion in the past decade \u2014 while foreign investors sour on Chinese markets. Beijing\u2019s loudly touted Belt-and-Road initiative looks increasingly like a swamp of corruption, malinvestment and bad debt. Its retaliatory options in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war are bad and few. And General Secretary Xi Jinping has created a cult-of-personality dictatorship in a style unseen since Mao Zedong, China\u2019s last disastrous emperor.\n\nRemember the \u201cChinese Dream\u201d \u2014 Xi\u2019s vision of China as a modern, powerful, and \u201cmoderately well-off\u201d state? Forget it. The current task for Chinese leadership is to avoid a full-blown nightmare of international isolation, economic decline, and domestic revolt.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s still possible.\n\nChina\u2019s presumptive trajectory once seemed clear. In domestic affairs: rapid economic reform; slow political opening. Lather, rinse, repeat. In international affairs: peaceful rise; burgeoning clout. It was to be a model of managed development, a Middle Kingdom fit for the 21st century.\n\nThat\u2019s not what happened, for reasons that Chang and others saw coming long ago. Rapid growth is easy when labor and capital are plentiful and cheap. But most developing countries inevitably fall into what\u2019s called the middle-income trap, when they no longer have the cost advantages of poor countries but haven\u2019t yet acquired the legal, educational, or technological advantages of rich ones.\n\nIt turns out to be a trap few countries escape: Of 101 countries defined as \u201cmiddle income\u201d in 1960, only 13 rose to high-income by 2008, according to a World Bank report. And some of these countries, like Greece, are prone to slip backward.\n\nBeijing\u2019s dilemmas go deeper. Economic reforms generate sudden riches that are ripe targets for extravagant graft, particularly by powerful state actors. Graft creates incentives for further self-dealing, which distorts economic decision-making and breeds public cynicism. Aggressive anti-corruption drives of the sort carried out by Xi since coming to power often amount to power plays between political factions competing for booty.\n\nThe result: more corruption, more cynicism, more repression. How long that can keep going is an open question.\n\nBut scholars such as Larry Diamond and Minxin Pei have noted that dictatorships tend to have a roughly 70-year lifespan. At some point, the revolutionary fervor that sustains the first generation of leaders and the will to power that sustains the second gives way to the policy failures, mounting discontents, outside shocks and inner doubts that prove the undoing of the third.\n\nEspecially when the regime experiences some kind of blunt trauma, either in the form of a foreign-policy fiasco, an economic shock, or a moral outrage. In its attempts to respond to Hong Kong\u2019s protests, Beijing risks all three.\n\nA policy of hoping the protesters discredit themselves or simply run out of steam shows no sign of working. A Tiananmen-style crackdown would underscore the regime\u2019s brutishness and incompetence, destroy Hong Kong as a global financial capital, and spur China\u2019s neighbors to arm to the teeth and draw closer to Washington. Accommodating the protesters\u2019 demands, above all the granting of genuine universal suffrage, is the right thing to do, but introduces a democratic principle fatal to the regime\u2019s self-preservation.\n\nHence the looming crisis. It could be defused, if Beijing guarantees amnesty for all nonviolent protesters and removes the troops it has brought in from the mainland in exchange for a meaningful process of negotiation. Or it could be \u201csolved\u201d through some form of hyper-aggressive policing that stops short of an outright massacre. But that only puts a lid on discontents that will continue to boil.\n\nSkeptics will note that China\u2019s profound cultural aversion to the prospect of political disunity and chaos may incline the mainland Chinese to approve a hard government line with Hong Kong. And nothing in Xi\u2019s actions or manner suggests he suffers from Gorbachev-like misgivings about the nature of the regime he rules or of his right to exercise power by whatever means necessary.\n\nBut if the regime\u2019s travails prove anything, it\u2019s that China\u2019s current despot is no more enlightened than despots elsewhere, and China\u2019s people are no less eager to have what people have elsewhere: justice, fairness, rights, freedom from fear, freedom itself. In China\u2019s looming crisis, the human condition shines through.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
