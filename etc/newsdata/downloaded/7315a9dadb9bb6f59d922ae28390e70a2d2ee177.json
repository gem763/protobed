Do you like them [sic]?\n\n\u201cYeah, why?\u201d he replies.\n\n(Image: WEST)\n\n\"Because people are saying why I am promoting you to promote a drink. It\u2019s only because I\u2019m getting stick\u2026 again.\"\n\n\"Well, why am I not allowed to say what I like?\"\n\n\"Well, you can,\" Katie explains. \"But just because they think it\u2019s a promotion when I\u2019m actually trying to say they\u2019re good for you and I buy them in Tesco. Like with Harvey he\u2019s not allowed to have anything with sugar in.\"\n\nShe wrote next to the short video: \"Saying the kids are promoting. Call me for letting the kids have drinks that are totally sugar free full of vitamins and amazing for Harv too that they love?? Better than them drinking fizzy drinks or juice! Have a day off (sic).\"", "description": "The model and businesswoman has been slammed by her followers for dressing Bunny in knee-high boots with a heel", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Instagram", "Rex Features", "West"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14323350.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Loose-Women-TV-show-London-UK-01-Apr-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
