Six defeats in a row became the catalyst for an epic, historic feat.\n\nIn the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s stunning annihilation of the fabled, shattered All Blacks, the mastermind of this momentous World Cup semi-final win in Yokohama pinpointed the vital transformation behind his side\u2019s triumph.\n\n\u2018If you look at the evolution of this team, it started on the South Africa tour,\u2019 said Jones of the three-Test series against the Springboks last June. \u2018We had a fairly solid team for the first two years (of his reign), and we knew we had to make changes to regenerate and reinvigorate.\u2019\n\nEngland's series loss to South Africa last summer was the catalyst for wholesale changes\n\nA combination of tactical tweaks and coaching recruitment has formed a new-look England\n\nThe head coach realised the need for change when his regime went into sudden crisis mode. They had their world record-equalling run of 18 consecutive Test wins in 2016 and early 2017 but the wheels came off in 2018.\n\nAfter Six Nations losses to Scotland, France and Ireland, England were torn to shreds by the Barbarians in a non-cap match at Twickenham, before losing the Boks series 2-1.\n\nBy then, an overhaul was in motion and on Saturday the fruits of it were there for all to see. Defeats and criticism reinforced the need for a changing of the guard, which Jones had long spoken about but had not yet significantly implemented. It all happened in a hurry.\n\nTom Curry was integrated into the team in South Africa and has established himself as arguably the world\u2019s finest young forward. His exploits here have led many observers and peers \u2014 English and foreign \u2014 to suggest he could become a modern-day great.\n\nThere has been so much change in a relatively short space of time. Elliot Daly was switched from wing to full-back and Jones kept him there, in the face of widespread doubts about his authority under the high ball. Daly\u2019s break and off-load to Anthony Watson ignited the attack which ended in Manu Tuilagi\u2019s second-minute try against the All Blacks.\n\nGeorge Ford lost his place in England\u2019s starting XV for the final Test of that South Africa tour and he stayed among the replacements \u2014 or \u2018finishers\u2019 as Jones calls them \u2014 last season. But his heroic efforts on behalf of a struggling Leicester side enhanced his leadership and his competitive streak, which helped him win back the England No 10 shirt. On Saturday, he pulled the strings and kicked his four penalties with calm authority.\n\nJones gave Owen Farrell the captain's armband as ex-skipper Dylan Hartley was suspended\n\nThe No 12 has taken on the role with aplomb and was central to England's win on Saturday\n\nThere was a leadership transition in South Africa last June, too. With Dylan Hartley unavailable, Owen Farrell took on the captaincy role. It was a crucial audition phase. He handled it well and it soon became his England team. On Saturday, he led by stirring example, despite being in pain, and his team-mates took their cue from their No 12.\n\nIt is remarkable to think now, but it was not until last summer that Jamie George really took a grip on the hooker position, after serving as Hartley\u2019s under-study for so long. He started all three Tests, having only ever worn the England No 2 shirt twice before.\n\nOn Saturday, putting aside his role in the lineout glitch which led to New Zealand\u2019s try, the Saracen was outstanding, in tight and open play. His all-action work typified the collective English masterpiece.\n\nNew Zealand came up against a side who had been magnificently coached and physically prepared.\n\nSteve Borthwick was rightly lauded afterwards for overseeing what, overall, was an outstanding lineout operation, controlling an area the All Blacks hoped to dominate. There was also clear evidence of the impact made by Jones\u2019 two Antipodean assistants.\n\nWinger Elliot Daly was switched from winger to full back and has slotted well in the position\n\nYoung Tom Curry has been revolutionary to England's ruck game and is earning his plaudits\n\nAgain, it traces back to the crisis phase. Australian Scott Wisemantel agreed to be England\u2019s attack coach on a trial basis for the South Africa tour. The players responded well to his enthusiasm, communication and innovation. He has been around ever since and if the RFU have any sense, they will try to retain his services.\n\nWhat an effect he has had. England\u2019s early attacking against the All Blacks was explosive and varied and lethal. It showcased the handling ability of the forwards, which has been another aspect of the evolutionary process. Kyle Sinckler is the standard-bearer, with his exceptional close-quarters distribution and vision, but others have stepped up too \u2014 notably Courtney Lawes, Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje, George and Curry.\n\nNew Zealand had no idea how to stop England because they never knew where the trouble was coming from next. If they braced for a power drive, an English forward would switch the point of attack at the last second. If they prepared for the pass, they were smashed backwards. The big men in white kept winning the collisions but often they didn\u2019t need to \u2014 they just created space instead.\n\nThe recruitment of Australian attacking coach Scott Wisemantel has been key going forward\n\nForwards such as Kyle Sinckler are proving difficult to handle with their varied style of play\n\nJohn Mitchell, the ex-All Black head coach whose primary roles are to organise the defence and mentor the back-rowers, deserves huge credit for both.\n\nEngland\u2019s hard-hitting lock-out was so emphatic that New Zealand had been reduced to a rabble long before the end of this semi-final. Kiwi icons had morphed into headless chickens, running around in circles, hurling optimistic off-loads into fresh air.\n\nMitchell\u2019s appointment was widely questioned, but under the experienced, well-travelled Kiwi England have gone from being breakdown prey to predators, especially since Curry and Sam Underhill have joined forces. On Saturday, those two and Itoje led a ruck rout of the All Blacks. It was as if all rugby logic had been turned upside-down.\n\nJones has often spoken about wanting his team to be true to the national rugby DNA, placing an emphasis on set-piece strength, work-rate, defensive force and all-round aggression. But in truth, this performance was more than just the full English. At times, they looked more like All Blacks than New Zealand did. They were more skilful, accurate, clinical and canny. They held all the aces.\n\nBringing in former All Blacks head coach Scott Mitchell has secured England's defence too\n\nThe final step was to cure the loss of composure and unity which resurfaced in the 38-38 draw with Scotland in March \u2014 when England threw away a 31-0 lead at Twickenham. Sports psychologists and honesty sessions helped to clear the air. That was evident in the way Farrell and Co coped with an Australian fightback in the quarter-final. And again on Saturday, when their dominance was not reflected on the scoreboard.\n\nThe final result did nothing to reflect how emphatically Jones\u2019 men overwhelmed New Zealand, who didn\u2019t deserve a point. It should have been 30-0. Really.\n\nOnce the dust had settled, the same thought persisted; that this was England\u2019s finest individual Test performance. It was better than the 2003 final, given the opposition and just how convincingly they were put away. It was near-perfection. England were fit, tough, smart, skilful, intense and relentless. Tactically, Jones comprehensively out-foxed Hansen.\n\nOf course, the task now is to climb the mountain again and find another towering peak in the final. Ultimate, life-changing glory now lies within reach, thanks to this 80-minute masterpiece.", "description": "The Greatest\u00a0English Test victory of all time was born amid the wreckage of the only major losing run of the Eddie Jones era.
