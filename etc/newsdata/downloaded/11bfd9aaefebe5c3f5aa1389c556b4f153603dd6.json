warmer surface water has expanded the force and range of deadly tropical storms; marine heatwaves are wiping out shallow-water coral reefs, which are unlikely to survive the century.\n\nMost threatening of all, accelerating melt-off from glaciers and especially Earth's ice sheets atop Greenland and Antarctica are driving sea level rise.\n\nAs if on cue, part of a massive glacier on the Italian side of the Mont Blanc mountain range was deemed close to collapse on Wednesday, a victim of rapid melting in the late summer heat.\n\n- 'A world of higher seas' -\n\nSince 2005, the ocean has risen 2.5 times faster than during the 20th century, a pace that could quadruple again by 2100 if carbon emissions continue unabated, the report found.\n\n\"Regardless of emissions scenarios, we face a world of higher sea levels,\" said co-author Bruce Glavovic, a professor at Massey University, New Zealand, noting that humanity is concentrated on the world's shorelines.\n\n\"It doesn't take a big rise in sea level to lead to catastrophic problems,\" he added. \"Sea level rise is not a slow onset problem -- it's a crisis of extreme weather events.\"\n\nBy 2050, many coastal megacities and small island nations will experience what were formerly once-a-century weather disasters every year -- even with an aggressive drawdown of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAnd by mid-century, more than a billion people will be living in vulnerable low-lying areas.\n\n- Hefty price tag -\n\nSome cities, such as New York, plan to spend tens of billions of dollars -- and probably far more -- to shore up their defences.\n\nIndeed, building dikes and levees along with other measures would substantially reduce the costs of flooding caused by sea level rise and storm surges, according to the IPCC report's 42-page Summary for Policy Makers.\n\nBut the cost of implementing such measures could reach hundreds of billions of dollars a year.", "description": "Two days after a climate summit failed to deliver game-changing pledges to slash carbon emissions, the United Nations warned Wednesday that global warming is devastating oceans and Earth's frozen spaces in ways that directly threaten a large slice of humanity.
