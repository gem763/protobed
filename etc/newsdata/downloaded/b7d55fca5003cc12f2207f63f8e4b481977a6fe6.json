Gabriele Cioffi, the former Torino centre-back who has been in charge of the club for just over a year, charged on to the pitch in an unhinged whirligig of celebration. But despite what might be thought about seeing him belting across the pitch punching the air and hugging anyone he met, he would like to point out that it was not a reaction that was typical of his management style.\n\n\u201cNormally I\u2019m calm and rational,\u201d he says, after training one day last week. \u201cIt is only when I lose my balance I become emotional.\u201d It certainly was emotional. So much so, you have to wonder how he would respond were his League Two side to pull off a miracle and win the entire competition next spring.\n\n\u201cPeople say: why is he showing off, has his team won the Carabao Cup? But you have to understand where that run came from. That was the perfect game, when my players did everything I ask. It was a run of love, because I love my players. When you see the players every day spitting blood on the training pitch, the moment when they succeed you feel it deep inside. Let\u2019s enjoy.
