He was among the best wingers of the 1990s, along with late New Zealand great Jonah Lomu. Although by the time France upset New Zealand 43-31 in the 1999 World Cup semifinal, he had shifted to center.\n\nHe is well placed to advise the equally versatile Romain on life at rugby\u2019s top end, but remains discrete so as not to increase the pressure on his son.\n\n\u201cHe has never told me how I should play, he just tells me to enjoy it because these are unique moments in a career,\u201d the younger Ntamack said. \u201cWe are privileged to be here. He just told me to savor every moment. I listen carefully to his advice so that I have no regrets, and as many memories as possible.\u201d\n\nHis father has plenty of those. After all, he won four matches in his career against New Zealand, which not many players have done. He was part of the team which earned widespread praise on its Tour of New Zealand in 1994, where Les Tricolors won 23-20 at Eden Park - a feat no other team has achieved since. He scored France\u2019s first try and was involved in the famed second by fullback Jean-Luc Sadourny - known as The try from the end of the world because it was launched from the French quarter.\n\nHe earned praise from Lomu for his performances on that tour, and now his son is receiving some high-profile compliments of his own.\n\n\u201cWhat I see in him is an enormous potential. He\u2019s capable of doing everything,\u201d Wilkinson told sports daily L\u2019Equipe\u2019s TV channel. \u201cWith a bit more experience, he\u2019ll understand things even better. He needs to get the opportunities, needs to be supported and given confidence.\u201d\n\nWilkinson, the scorer of England\u2019s winning dropped goal in the 2003 World Cup final against Australia, was speaking after France beat Argentina 23-21 in their opening World Cup game. Ntamack helped launch early attacks with his slick passing and clever kicking, coolly slotted over two penalty goals and converted both of France\u2019s tries.\n\nIt was his World Cup debut, yet it looked like he had been around for years.\n\nVeteran fullback Maxime Medard has played 62 tests for France, including in the 2011 final loss to New Zealand. He is struck by how smoothly Ntamack made the transition to World Cup rugby.\n\n\u201cHe already has the character of a player who\u2019s 30,\u201d Medard said. \u201cHe\u2019s calm, and he doesn\u2019t panic.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ntamack appears shy and not very verbose, Medard explains that this is just his way of dealing with raised expectations.\n\n\u201cOn the pitch he expresses himself and talks a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a No. 10 has to - so he\u2019s not introverted.\u201d\n\nNtamack\u2019s performances in Japan have been polished rather than spectacular, although selection choices have stifled the halves in terms of getting any partnerships going.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s fair to say, Ntamack has yet to show his full range of creative passing and has stood out more through his kicking.\n\nHe started alongside scrumhalf Antoine Dupont against Argentina, but was on the bench for most of the 33-9 win over the United States as Camille Lopez started one alongside Maxime Machenaud.\n\nConfusing?\n\nWell, that\u2019s because France has been chopping and changing the halves in the past decade or more.\n\nCurrent coach Jacques Brunel has picked a different halves pairing in all three games.\n\nSo in the 23-21 win against Tonga, it was Ntamack returning at flyhalf alongside Baptiste Serin and scoring two tries and kicking three penalties.\n\nBrunel would likely then have picked his strongest XV for the last Pool C game against England last Saturday, but the contest against old rival England was among those called off because of a typhoon devastating parts of Japan.\n\nStill, Ntamack is touted to line up against the Welsh.\n\nHe made his test debut against Wales in the Six Nations this year, albeit at center, and has one try and a dropped goal in 11 tests. Previously, he showed glimpses of his undoubted talent for the French Barbarians and - not least - the France team which won the Under-20 World Cup.\n\nHe starred in the semifinal win against New Zealand, scoring the game\u2019s only try.\n\nLike father, like son, then.\n\nAt club level, too, for they have both played for standout side Toulouse in the French top division.\n\nEmile played his entire career there, making more than 350 club appearances and winning three European Cups to go with six French titles.\n\nAfter the World Cup, Romain will start his third season with Toulouse.\n\nRomain joined Toulouse\u2019s rugby school at the age of five.\n\nOver the years, it might have felt like he was always trying to emulate his father. But Emile never won a World Cup, something Romain still has the chance to do.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's not easy to follow in your father's footsteps when he is one of the best wingers to have played for France.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/japan_rugby_wcup_france_ntamacks_rise_18331_c0-113-2688-1681_s1200x700.jpg?577f29ebd789c935a290c91cbfcbfdc564c7bd39", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
