REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\n\nThe deal, which was not unexpected, marks the second major acquisition by Santos in less than a year, following a sharp turnaround in its fortunes under Managing Director Kevin Gallagher, and pushed its shares up 7% in early trade on Monday.\n\nConocoPhillips, which has been focusing on its U.S. shale assets, will quit the Darwin LNG plant, which it opened in 2006, and gas fields off northern Australia, but hold on to its stake in the Australia Pacific LNG plant in Queensland state.\n\n\u201cWhile we believe the Darwin LNG backfill project remains among the lower cost of supply options for new global LNG supply, this transaction allows us to allocate capital to other projects,\u201d ConocoPhillips Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox said in a statement.\n\nThe move comes as the Bayu-Undan gas field that feeds Darwin LNG is set to run dry in 2022 and the project\u2019s owners near a decision on which field to develop next to keep the plant open, with Santos aiming to develop the Barossa field.\n\n\u201cThe big prize here is pushing forward with development (of Barossa) and setting up the framework to develop other resources in the region over time,\u201d Gallagher told reporters on a conference call.\n\nThe deal, set to close in the first quarter of 2020, is expected to boost Santos\u2019 earnings per share by 16% and increase its production by 25% in 2020, the company said. It adds to its stakes in the Gladstone LNG project and PNG LNG in Papua New Guinea.\n\nSantos has agreed to pay a further $75 million if a final investment decision is reached on developing the Barossa field. It plans to fund the whole acquisition out of cash and new debt.\n\nDARWIN STAKE SALE\n\nThe deal gives Santos control over the future of Darwin LNG, the second-oldest of Australia\u2019s 10 LNG plants, at a time when it is vying against several LNG projects worldwide to line up gas buyers to extend its life.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a good deal. They go from being a small joint venture partner to being the operator,\u201d said Stephen Butel, an analyst at Platypus Asset Management. \u201cIt allows them to take control of the situation there.\u201d\n\nSantos will acquire ConocoPhillips\u2019 majority stakes in Darwin LNG and Bayu-Undan, as well as a 37.5% stake in Barossa, but will aim to cut its stakes in Darwin LNG and Barossa to about 40%-50%.\n\nIt said it has already reached a preliminary agreement to sell down a 25% stake in Darwin LNG to its Barossa partner SK E&S of South Korea.\n\nIt was also in talks with other Darwin LNG partners, which include Japan\u2019s Inpex Corp (1605.T), Italy\u2019s Eni SpA (ENI.MI), Japan\u2019s JERA (9501.T) (9502.T) and Tokyo Gas (9531.T), to sell equity in Barossa and Darwin LNG.\n\nAt the same time, Santos said it is aiming to line up contracts for 60%-80% of LNG volumes for more than 10 years before taking a final investment decision on Barossa \u2014 the first time it has spelled out a target for contracts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very competitive. It\u2019s positioned well. We\u2019re very confident we\u2019ll get it away. And it\u2019s got very robust economics even in this soft market that we find ourselves in today,\u201d Gallagher said.", "description": "ConocoPhillips has agreed to sell its northern Australian business to partner Santos Ltd for $1.39 billion, in a deal that will hike the Australian group's output by 25% and boost its position in the global gas market.", "authors": ["Sonali Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440523129&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0P7-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
