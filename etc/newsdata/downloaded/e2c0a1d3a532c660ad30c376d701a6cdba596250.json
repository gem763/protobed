This is an issue we feel to our core.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur interest in this case is simple: We are distressed at the prospect of ripping our DACA colleagues from the fabric of our company,\u201d Cook and O\u2019Brien wrote. \u201cThis issue is a moral one: Our country made a deal with a highly vulnerable population interested in a bright future, and we should keep that deal.\u201d\n\nNext month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments from both sides as it decides whether to allow the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of the program, which could leave hundreds of thousands of recipients at risk of deportation.\n\nThe program was created under the Obama administration to provide legal protection to immigrants, often referred to as \"Dreamers,\" who were brought to the U.S. as children and grew up here.\n\nCook and O\u2019Brien wrote that Apple employs 443 Dreamers and that the company sought out and hired them after the DACA was created, \u201crelying on the commitment our government made to them.\u201d In the brief, they described the lives and careers of five of those employees.\n\n\u201cWe collectively owe it to the Dreamers to hold up our end of the bargain. It is not just a legal requirement,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is the moral thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case on Nov. 12.\n\n20191002154056089_Apple Amicus Brief by M Mali on Scribd", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook urged the Supreme Court to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/timcook_donaldtrump_030619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
