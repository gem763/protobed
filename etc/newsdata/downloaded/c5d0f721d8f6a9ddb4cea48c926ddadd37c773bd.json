REUTERS/Russell Cheyne/File Photo\n\nA Diageo spokeswoman said that the unions had initially demanded 5% pay hikes when talks started in May, but had since come down to 3.5%.\n\nThe source said that the unions \u201cnever\u201d agreed to settle at 3.5% and that their previous demand still stood.\n\nMembers of Scotland\u2019s Unite and GMB unions, who make up half of Diageo\u2019s 3,000 Scottish workforce, are set to go on rolling strikes at the company\u2019s Cameronbridge, Leven and Shieldhall sites in Scotland between Sept. 17 and 27, after talks with Diageo collapsed last month.\n\nThe unions on Aug. 30 again rejected Diageo\u2019s offer to increase wages by 2.8%, after rejecting a prior offer of 2.5%. Last year, workers received a 3.2% hike.\n\nBob MacGregor, regional industrial officer of Scottish union Unite, has said previously that production would come to a standstill if the strikes go ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to listen to any offer from the company above what they offered last year... but what our members won\u2019t accept is a pay cut,\u201d MacGregor told Reuters.\n\nThe Diageo spokeswoman said the union\u2019s estimate that the strikes would cause losses of 1 million pounds a day did not have \u201cany ground in reality\u201d and that the company was unable to verify the number.\n\nThe unions have said their demands should be taken in the context of the world\u2019s largest spirits maker\u2019s annual profits, which were 4.2 billion pounds ($5.19 billion) last year.\n\nThe unions have also voiced frustrations over Diageo\u2019s plan to build a 150 million pound Johnnie Walker visitor attraction in Edinburgh, as part of an investment in Scottish whisky tourism.\n\nDiageo has 29 distilleries in Scotland and exports 80% of the whiskey it produces there to 180 countries in the world. The company is the single biggest exporter of whiskey from Scotland and produces for brands including Johnnie Walker, Lagavulin and Talisker at the three sites.\n\nDiageo\u2019s pay offers year-over-year take into account the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \u2013 regarded as the UK\u2019s rate of inflation - and the Retail Price Index (RPI), the spokeswoman said.\n\nUK CPI stood at 2.1%, while RPI was 2.8%, in July.\n\n\u201cWe want our employees in Scotland to continue to be well paid for the great job they do and receive a rise above the cost of living,\u201d a Diageo spokesperson said. \u201cEveryone receives a broad range of strong benefits, which this month included free shares worth 8.56% of salaries for every employee.\u201d\n\nThe company said it had contingency plans in place for a strike, but wanted to reach a deal via \u201cmeaningful talks.\u201d\n\nThe unions and Diageo are due to meet again on Monday.", "description": "Unions at Diageo are demanding a 5% pay rise for workers due to go on strike in Scotland later this month and believe the stoppages will cost the drinks company 1 million pounds ($1.2 million) a day, a source familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Siddharth Cavale", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429160511&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1SW", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
