Two years later, passing rates plunged to 35 percent.\n\n[Student exam scores in Virginia spark concerns about gaps]\n\nThe precipitous decline was clear across all subjects that English-language learners were tested on \u2014 passing rates tumbled by 20 percentage points or more on Standards of Learning tests in reading, writing, science and history. Math scores for English-language learners dropped, too, although not quite as dramatically as in other subjects: In the 2018-2019 academic year, 59 percent passed state math exams, compared with 68 percent in 2016-2017.\n\nBut the numbers didn\u2019t paint a complete picture.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Education had changed the way it calculated passing rates for English-language learners after an overhaul of federal education law, resulting in what appeared to be a significant drop-off in performance.\n\nSchool systems monitor the progress of English-language learners after they gain English proficiency. Previously, Virginia education officials included the scores of those former English-language learners in their calculation of overall passing rates, for up to two years after the student was no longer classified as an English-language learner. That had the effect of inflating the passing rate for that group of students overall.\n\nThat changed with the most recent round of exams.\n\nThis time, the state did not include the scores of former English-language learners, which meant the results released in August reflected only the passing rates of students currently classified as English learners.\n\nThe state also recalculated passing rates for the 2017-2018 school year to remove the scores of students who had gained English proficiency, said Charles Pyle, spokesman for the Virginia Department of Education.\n\nThe state said it adjusted its calculations to comply with reporting requirements under the Every Student Succeeds Act, the federal education law that replaced No Child Left Behind, a test-based accountability system that became widely viewed as overly punitive and unrealistic.\n\nIn the future, Pyle said, the state plans on publishing data that show passing rates with and without the scores of former English-language learners.\n\n\u201cThere is value in reporting a figure that does speak to the success of schools moving students to English proficiency, and so we\u2019re looking at, eventually, reporting both pass rates in our public reporting,\u201d Pyle said.\n\nSloan Presidio, an assistant superintendent in Fairfax County Public Schools, said students who are still learning English cannot be expected to perform as well on high-stakes standardized tests as their peers who are fluent in the language. Fairfax, the largest school system in Virginia, educates more than one-third of the state\u2019s English-language learners.\n\n\u201cStudents who are still learning to read and write English are at a significant disadvantage when trying to demonstrate their content knowledge on standardized tests that are written in a language in which they are not yet proficient,\u201d Presidio said.\n\nAfter English-language learners are given time to develop their reading, writing and speaking skills, they perform \u201cat or above the division averages,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Education released state standardized test scores for the 2018-2019 school year on Aug. 13. Students begin taking Standards of Learning tests in third grade and sit for them through high school.\n\nState officials have promised to work with school systems to burnish students\u2019 reading skills, after the results revealed persistent and, in some cases, deepening gaps in scores between black and Hispanic students and their white and Asian peers.\n\nRead more:\n\nArlington school system signs agreement to improve support for English learners\n\nWhy it\u2019s hard to be a teacher of English language learners \u2014 by an ELL teacher\n\nNew federal guidelines highlight civil rights of English language learners\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "64 percent passed state reading tests in 2016-2017.
