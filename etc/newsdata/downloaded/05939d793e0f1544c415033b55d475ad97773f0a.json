Photo-Illustration: Courtesy of Studios.\n\nAfter what seemed like a lackluster summer, the year in movies is about to start showing some real signs of life. At least, let\u2019s hope so. The next few months are shaping up to be an endless stream of awards contenders, alongside attempts to revive dormant franchises, Stephen King adaptations, Disney blockbusters, and whatever the hell Cats is.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Great\n\nBy David Edelstein\n\nSeptember\n\nAd Astra (9/20)\n\nI rarely plunder studio synopses, but this one seems unusually pithy: \u201cAn astronaut travels to the outer edges of the solar system to find his father and unravel a mystery that threatens the survival of our planet. He uncovers secrets which challenge the nature of human existence and our place in the cosmos.\u201d The weird thing is that the director is James Gray (The Yards, The Immigrant, The Lost City of Z), one of American cinema\u2019s more earthbound directors. But Brad Pitt is a space cadet (in real life and on film), and the otherworldly cast includes Donald Sutherland, Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga, and Liv Tyler. The title could be a nod to the Latin phrase per aspera ad astra, which means, roughly, \u201cThrough hardships to the stars,\u201d so let\u2019s hope the hardships are the characters\u2019.\n\nOctober\n\nJoker (10/4)\n\nDespite the use of wild man to denote daringly unhinged (or just unhinged) actors, an actor without a hinge is only sporadically effective. An exception is the slurring, tottering, often galvanic Joaquin Phoenix, who gives you the sense that there\u2019s an emotional cost to what he does. His Joker origin story might be godawful, but I\u2019m thrilled by someone giving Phoenix license to test the limits as the mad clown. And a Joker origin story is one of the few DC enterprises I\u2019m excited about, especially since the studio made a mess of The Killing Joke.\n\nParasite (10/11)\n\nThe beloved though spotty Korean director Bong Joon-ho (The Host) stole the thunder from Quentin Tarantino at Cannes, where this scabrous comedy about a poor family that insinuates itself into the home of a rich one made off with the top prize. My colleague Bilge Ebiri called it a \u201cnerve-racking masterpiece,\u201d and though my nerves are too well racked these days, I look forward to the prospect of Bong \u201cmaking us cheer on depraved behavior and then pulling the rug out from under our sick expectations.\u201d Now, that\u2019s an ad quote!\n\nNovember\n\nThe Irishman (11/1)\n\nMartin Scorsese. Robert De Niro. Harvey Keitel. Joe Pesci. Before you say \u201cHoly crap,\u201d there\u2019s another star in the cast who didn\u2019t appear in GoodFellas, Mean Streets, or Taxi Driver: Al Pacino (one hopes on a short leash) as Jimmy Hoffa. Basically, Netflix just threw money at these titans to get them together, which could be a recipe for disaster but not with its who-whacked-Hoffa subject. No, I don\u2019t see De Niro as an Irishman either [Ed.: He played one in GoodFellas] [D.E.: Proves my point] [Ed.: You really want to say that?] [D.E.: Leave it in], but crackerjack screenwriter Steven Zaillian\u2019s script is based on a mind-blowing memoir by Charles Brandt called I Heard You Paint Houses that makes you think Brandt knows not just who really killed Hoffa but John F. Kennedy, Roger Rabbit, and Jeffrey Epstein, too.\n\nMarriage Story (11/6)\n\nThe undeniably talented Noah Baumbach has been acclaimed for so many smart but sour, emotionally curdled movies that I take the buzz over his latest drama warily. That said, The Squid and the Whale is an unnervingly incisive portrait of the impact a crumbling marriage has on two kids, and this one features two unpredictable actors, Adam Driver and the perpetually underrated Scarlett Johansson. It also sounds like a close-to-the-bone subject: the grueling demise of the marriage between a stage director and his actress wife. Substitute film for stage and consider Baumbach\u2019s ugly breakup with Jennifer Jason Leigh, and the prospects are sunny indeed.\n\nThe Report (11/15)\n\nAs in the CIA \u201cTorture Report.\u201d As in George W. Bush saying, \u201cThis country doesn\u2019t torture,\u201d while people are being waterboarded, starved, sexually humiliated, and beaten. It\u2019s not a documentary: The committed writer and producer Scott Z. Burns makes his directorial debut, focusing not on what he didn\u2019t see (the ghastly Geneva Conventions violations) but on the Senate investigation and the congressional hearings that dragged the horror into the light. Sound dry? Not with Adam Driver, Corey Stoll, Jon Hamm, and Annette Bening as Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nKnives Out (11/27)\n\nRian Johnson (Brick, Star Wars: The Last Jedi) isn\u2019t a great original, but he has a talent for doing parodic takes on the works that inspired him without drifting into camp or undermining his passion. Here, he plumbs that most gimmicky of gimmick genres \u2014 the all-star house-party whodunit \u2014 with a delectable cast that includes Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, and Lakeith Stanfield. No, I don\u2019t see how those disparate actors can mesh either, but I hope to be surprised and delighted.\n\nDecember\n\nLittle Women (12/25)\n\nGreta Gerwig gathers an astounding, breathtaking, mouthwatering (supply your own adjective!) cast in this version of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s beacon of girlish autonomy (at least in the novel\u2019s first half) with Saoirse Ronan as Jo, Florence Pugh as Amy, Emma Watson as Meg \u2026 I could on, as the casting director did, with Laura Dern and Dame Meryl Streep. (She\u2019s not technically a dame, but I dub her.) Critics\u2019 darling (hell, my darling) Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Tracy Letts (did you see him in All My Sons? Holy shit), and Bob Odenkirk represent heterosexual white males. I just hope that as critics huzzah over Gerwig they also remember the excellent Gillian Armstrong version of 25 years ago.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Big\n\nBy Bilge Ebiri\n\nSeptember\n\nIt: Chapter Two (9/6)\n\nSplitting the interwoven time lines of Stephen King\u2019s 1986 tome into two movies was a risky move, but the first film, released in 2017, was a huge hit. Now the characters are grown up and played by name actors, Jessica Chastain and Bill Hader among them. Can they vanquish King\u2019s eternal evil for good? Or are we looking at more sequels?\n\nRambo: Last Blood (9/20)\n\n\ufeffCan Sylvester Stallone reinvent conservative icon John Rambo for our troubled times? (And, uh, whose side will he be on this time?) Expect hot takes.\n\nJudy (9/27)\n\nRenee. Zellweger. Is. Judy. Garland.\n\nThe Laundromat (9/27)\n\nSteven Soderbergh \u2014 who, let\u2019s not forget, claimed to have retired from filmmaking some years ago \u2014 is back with another movie, this one a star-studded caper but also a politically charged look at the Panama Papers scandal. (When we interviewed Soderbergh earlier this year, he had this one sitting on his laptop, all ready to go, so the fact that it\u2019s being released now, during awards season, is surely a good sign.)\n\nOctober\n\nPain and Glory (10/4)\n\nPedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s most autobiographical film in decades looks at the many regrets of an aging ilmmaker, played by the great Antonio Banderas (who won the Best Actor award at Cannes in May).\n\nDolemite Is My Name (10/4)\n\nFor decades, people have longed to make a biopic of Rudy Ray Moore \u2014 the comic, blaxploitation star, and indie-film pioneer known as the Godfather of Rap. It\u2019s finally here, as Eddie Murphy\u2019s potential comeback vehicle.\n\nGemini Man (10/11)\n\nWill Smith battles his younger self in this sci-fi thriller that Hollywood will be watching very closely to check out the current state and viability of digital characters. The director, Ang Lee, is both an artistic and a technological visionary, so that makes this immediately of interest.\n\nThe King (10/11)\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet is playing Henry V, and everybody is very excited.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil (10/18)\n\nThe first was a reimagining of Sleeping Beauty from the supposedly evil witch\u2019s point of view and gave Angelina Jolie one of her most indelible roles. It\u2019ll be interesting to see in what new direction this follow-up will take the story.\n\nJojo Rabbit (10/18)\n\nDirector Taika Waititi has taken all the goodwill produced by Thor: Ragnarok\u2019s success and parlayed it into a playful comedy about \u2026 an eager young German boy in the Hitler Youth. Oh, and Waititi himself plays Hitler.\n\nThe Lighthouse (10/18)\n\nRobert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are 19th-century lighthouse keepers who may or may not be slowly going mad in this period-authentic and deeply unnerving thriller from The Witch director Robert Eggers.\n\nNovember\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate (11/1)\n\nWe\u2019ve been burned by Terminator sequels before, but dare we hope that this one \u2014 which returns Linda Hamilton to the role of Sarah Connor and boasts James Cameron himself as a producer \u2014 might break the curse?\n\nMotherless Brooklyn (11/1)\n\nWriter-director-star Edward Norton has spent well over a decade trying to make this film adaptation of Jonathan Lethem\u2019s beloved novel, and he\u2019s assembled a remarkable cast for it (including Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Alec Baldwin, Bruce Willis, and Willem Dafoe). But all eyes will be on Norton, one of our finest actors, who hasn\u2019t had a juicy lead role in many years.\n\nDoctor Sleep (11/8)\n\nStephen King\u2019s 2013 sequel to The Shining was well liked as a novel, but as a film it\u2019ll have to contend with the legacy of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1980 horror masterpiece, which the author (who has an executive-producer credit on this one) famously detests.\n\nLast Christmas (11/8)\n\nCan this romantic comedy written by Oscar-winning screenwriter (and Oscar-winning actress) Emma Thompson and set to the music of the late George Michael bring back the rom-com? (And with hints of a dark twist, is it possible it\u2019s not actually a rom-com?)\n\nFord v. Ferrari (11/15)\n\nI hate the title the filmmakers finally settled on, but this is the sort of process-oriented, ironic-capitalist, go-for-it movie Americans do well. James Mangold\u2019s drama centers on the ingenious car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and the driven driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), who attempt \u2014 underwritten by the oft-despicable Henry Ford (Tracy Letts; did you see him in All My Sons? Holy shit) \u2014 to best the Italian wizards of Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. What makes it tantalizing: They\u2019re none of them angels. \u2014D.E.\n\nAtlantics (11/15)\n\nEarlier this year, Mati Diop became the first black woman to screen a film in competition at Cannes, then she went and won the festival\u2019s Grand Jury Prize for this bewitching supernatural romantic drama set in Senegal.\n\nCharlie\u2019s Angels (11/15)\n\nElizabeth Banks directed and co-stars as Bosley in this latest reboot of the classic TV show, this time with Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska as the Angels. This one leans heavily on the comedy, it seems, which can only be a good sign.\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (11/22)\n\nThe nicest man in film, Tom Hanks, stars in this film about the nicest man on TV, Mr. Fred Rogers.\n\nFrozen II (11/22)\n\nThe first was not just the highest-grossing animated film of all time; it was a cultural phenomenon with its Hans Christian Andersen\u2013meets\u2013girl-power story line and viral soundtrack. It even turned Josh Gad into a star. The sequel will surely add to Disney\u2019s run of billion-dollar hits this year; fingers crossed that it also recaptures some of the original\u2019s magic.\n\nQueen & Slim (11/27)\n\nA first date (between Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith) goes off the rails when a cop pulls the couple over. Described as a Bonnie and Clyde\u2013style thriller, this was co-written by Lena Waithe (who calls the film \u201cprotest art\u201d) and directed by Grammy-winning music-video director Melina Matsoukas. It could be one of the breakout hits of the season.\n\nDecember\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire (12/6)\n\nC\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s alternately tense and tender queer period romance nearly set Cannes ablaze earlier this year and with good reason. Its pointed complication of the male gaze, coupled with passionate performances from leads No\u00e9mie Merlant and Ad\u00e8le Haenel, might just turn this into one of this year\u2019s hot-button movies.\n\nUncut Gems (12/13)\n\nAdam Sandler plays a Diamond District jeweler racing against the clock to pay off his debts in this thriller from Josh and Benny Safdie, indie poets of breakneck grit. (They made 2017\u2019s acclaimed Robert Pattinson thriller Good Time.)\n\nA Hidden Life (12/13)\n\nTerrence Malick\u2019s newest takes his wandering, lyrical, fragmented style and applies it to the real-life story of a devout Austrian dissenter who refused to pledge loyalty to Hitler. Film nerds will go to war as usual over Malick, but the resonant subject matter could also hit a nerve.\n\nJumanji: The Next Level (12/13)\n\nNobody thought Jumanji was going to be any good, and it turned out to be great. So it stands to reason that the sequel, which also looks quite terrible, will be even better.\n\nCats (12/20)\n\nSure, the trailer was ridiculous. Sure, digital fur on human actors looks weird. Sure, it\u2019s one of the strangest musicals ever made. Counterpoint: It\u2019s Cats. You\u2019ll still see it out of morbid curiosity.\n\nStar Wars: Episode 9 \u2014 The Rise of Skywalker (12/20)\n\nThe big question with the final installment of the Skywalker saga isn\u2019t how much it\u2019ll make but whether J. J. Abrams will undo the idiosyncratic narrative revelations of Rian Johnson\u2019s The Last Jedi, the most entertaining Star Wars movie in decades.\n\nBombshell (12/20)\n\nThe Roger Ailes sexual-harassment scandal at Fox News gets the big-screen treatment in a year when we\u2019ve already had the Showtime series The Loudest Voice, also about Ailes. But only this one\u2019s got Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie.\n\nFull Calendar\n\nSeptember 6\n\nIt: Chapter 2\n\nZeroville\n\nBlink of an Eye\n\nMs. Purple\n\nSeptember 13\n\nThe Goldfinch\n\nRunning with the Devil\n\nHustlers\n\nDepraved\n\nFreaks\n\nHaun\n\nMonos\n\nMoonlight Sonata\n\nSeptember 18\n\nMidnight Traveler\n\nDownton Abbey\n\nBetween Two Ferns\n\nRambo V: Last Blood\n\nCorporate Animals\n\nLoro\n\nAd Adstra\n\nDiego Maradona\n\nWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\n\nSeptember 27\n\n21 Bridges\n\nAbominable\n\nThe Day Shall Come\n\nJudy\n\nThe Laundromat\n\nThe Death of Dick Long\n\nExtra Ordinary\n\nThe Sound of Silence\n\nOctober 4\n\nJoker\n\nThe Current War\n\nLucy in the Sky\n\nPain & Glory\n\nWrinkles the Clown\n\nOctober 11\n\nGemini Man\n\nParasite\n\nThe Addams Family\n\nJexi\n\nThe Dead Center\n\nHigh Strung and Free Dance\n\nOctober 15\n\nJay and Silent Bob Reboot\n\nOctober 18\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\n\nZombieland: Double Tap\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nGreener Grass\n\nOctober 25\n\nDolemite is My Name\n\nFrankie\n\nBlak and Blue\n\nCountdown\n\nThe Last Full Measure\n\nThe Kill Team\n\nSynonyms\n\nOctober 31\n\n3 From Hell\n\nNovember 1\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate\n\nParadise Hills\n\nThe Irishman\n\nMotherless Brooklyn\n\nHarriet\n\nArctic Dogs\n\nBurden\n\nWaves\n\nNovember 6\n\nMarriage Story\n\nNovember 8\n\nMidway\n\nPlaying With Fire\n\nDoctor Sleep\n\nHoney Boy\n\nLast Christmas\n\nNovember 15\n\nCharlie\u2019s Angels\n\nThe Lodge\n\nFord V Ferrari\n\nEarthquake Bird\n\nThe Good Liar\n\nAll Rise\n\nThe Report\n\nNovember 22\n\nThe Rhythm Section\n\nFrozen 2\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\n21 Bridges\n\nDark Waters\n\nNovember 27\n\nKnives Out\n\nQueen & Slim\n\nThe Two Pope\n\nDecember 6\n\nPlaymobil: The Movie\n\nThe Aeronauts\n\nBrams: The Boy 2\n\nLittle Joe\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nDecember 13\n\nJumanji: The Next Level\n\nShaun The Sheep: Farmageddon\n\nBlack Christmas\n\nUncut Gems\n\nA Hidden Life\n\nCunningham\n\nDecember 20\n\nCats\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nSuperintelligence\n\nBombshell\n\nDecember 25\n\nSpies in Disguise\n\nLittle Women\n\n1917\n\nJust Mercy\n\nClemency\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
