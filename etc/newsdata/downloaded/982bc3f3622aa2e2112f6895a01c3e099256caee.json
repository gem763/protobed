Some media outlets, like now-defunct Gawker, specialized in it.\n\nHaving ignored the problem for years, Twitter is now scrambling to find a solution. Why?\n\nBecause mainstream journalists are now falling victim to the same tactic they regularly use on other people, ranging from viral charity fundraising heroes to anonymous Trump-supporting meme-makers.\n\nFollowing a number of scandals, some of which were exclusively reported by Breitbart News, including anti-semitic tweets from a New York Times editor and racist, anti-semitic tweets from\u2026 another New York Times editor!\n\nCancel culture \u2014 long a weapon of left-wing and mainstream journalists \u2014 is now affecting journalists themselves. So cancel culture must end, obviously!\n\nAccording to Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour, the platform is exploring ways to make it harder to dig up old tweets.\n\nFrom a recent interview with Beykpour by the Vergecast:\n\nFear of speaking in public and fear of retaliation or fear of being harassed and harassment means many different things to many people. Or fear of being held accountable for something that is not what you meant. These are some of the biggest reasons why people don\u2019t tweet. Which is why we actually take this very seriously.\n\nBeykpour also discussed some of the solutions Twitter was exploring to solve the problem, including potentially making tweets more ephemeral.\n\nI\u2019m very interested in exploring how we might give customers more control. Where ephemerality is just one of those dimensions, I think there are other dimensions that, while we can get excited and talk about ephemerality because there\u2019s lots of other standards of how other apps do this, I think other dimensions, like control around who can see or control around who can participate, is really critical.\n\nMany people would feel much more secure if \u201ccancel culture\u201d came to an end, or at least became more difficult. But it\u2019s interesting that journalists had to feel the fear they instilled in others for so long before Silicon Valley took any action.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
