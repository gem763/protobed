The single-screen theater, located in the city\u2019s industrial Al Quoz neighborhood, also hosts occasional open-air screenings that can attract up to 1,000 people from all walks of life. As a result, Ms. Kazim is nominated for an Emirates Woman 2019 Award for arts and culture.\n\nPhoto: Faisal Tannir / Rouya PR\n\nWhat She Loves:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very ambitious city through and through, and kind of a conveyor belt due to its large expatriate population. I\u2019m 35 and I\u2019ve seen so many people come in and out. You get used to people both coming here with their own tragedies, and you get used to people leaving all of the time. There\u2019s a unity through the transience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent time in Canada and New York, but I came back. I\u2019ve been in and out of the city my whole life. There has been tremendous change that I\u2019ve both mourned and celebrated.\n\n\u201cThe area I grew up in, Jumeirah, used to be mainland but now it's an island. The new Dubai canal project connected Dubai Creek through to the Gulf and suddenly that whole area became an island, let alone all of the new development.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of bizarre changes, some exciting or funny, others somehow painful because the memories you rooted yourself to and connected with growing up are gone. For instance, when Golden Cinema, the biggest standalone cinema in the city, closed we took the theater seats to Cinema Akil. People try to hold onto the nostalgia.\n\nInsider Tips:\n\n\u201cI grew up most of my life in Al Satwa, one of the older neighborhoods in Dubai. It\u2019s a mixed community of older buildings that I would call \u2018ugly beautiful.\u2019\n\n\u201cCinema Akil is in an area called Al Quoz, which is an industrial zone with export facilities and warehouses. It looks something like how New York City\u2019s Meatpacking District looked at one point, or Dumbo [in Brooklyn] without the residential component. It started with a few galleries, who took charge turning it into an arts community. At first, they were not consolidated and you had to really wander around getting lost in this area of warehouses.\n\n\u201cIt brings together everything from a coffee roastery of the hipster variety to an independent bookstore. There\u2019s the community theater, The Junction, and the record store, The Flipside, which happens to be our neighbor.\n\nAlserkal Avenue (in Al Quoz) is also one of the very few dog friendly areas in the city.\u201d", "description": "A reality TV judge, a top chef and an advocate for the independent art scene on their favorite places in the UAE city", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120386?size=1.8285714285714285&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
