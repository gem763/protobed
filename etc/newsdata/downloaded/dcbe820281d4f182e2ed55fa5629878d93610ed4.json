You get the certainty of the arrangement, the union gets the certainty of the arrangement, the workforce get the certainty of the arrangement,'' Mr Shorten said in a speech designed to build bridges with miners and big business just three days before polling day.\n\nHowever, Labor appears to have cooled since the election with shadow industrial relations minister Tony Burke saying the Opposition would need to see the exact detail of what was being proposed.\n\n\"It's something we said we would consider, we'll have a look at what they come back with,'' he said.\n\nMr Shorten, too, said he was proposing, if elected, to consider only lifetime deals negotiated between workers and unions, not non-union deals.\n\n\"I wouldn't trust the Coalition to do anything for workers,'' he said.\n\n\"I'm hugely sceptical of Mr Porter's motives.''\n\nUnion opposition\n\nCFMMEU national construction secretary Dave Noonan was coy at the time of Mr Shorten's announcement, saying the union wanted to see the detail before adopting a position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, he, too, said the union would oppose the idea because it was unfair to lock in terms and conditions for workers that could last between five and 10 years.\n\n\"No-one should be surprised that the Liberal Party wants to do the bidding of the big resource companies,'' he said.\n\n\"It's in their DNA.''\n\nMr Noonan said this was no different to asking contractors and suppliers to lock in their prices for the life of a project.\n\n\"Are Australian consumers going to get gas prices locked in for five years for these projects or will they float on the international market?''\n\nIndustry support for the change was strong.\n\nFast-tracking new jobs\n\n\"Allowing greenfields agreements to cover the life of projects is a sensible reform that will stimulate new investment and jobs across Australia,'' said Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are billions of dollars\u2019 worth of potential resources projects being developed in Australia that will benefit from greater certainty and confidence.\n\n\"This reform will help Australian minerals companies fast-track the delivery of more highly paid, highly skilled jobs to regional communities.\n\n\"All parliamentarians should commit to supporting this important reform.\"\n\nKicking life into enterprise bargaining\n\nAustralian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox was equally effusive, but said whole-of-life enterprise agreements should be extended beyond greenfields projects.\n\n\"At present, the maximum nominal term for an enterprise agreement is four years. However, many major projects continue for longer periods. For example, the Snowy Hydro 2.0 Project is projected to continue for five to six years,'' he said.\n\n\"Enterprise agreements that cover work on major projects should be able to continue for the life of the project even if this is longer than the current four-year limit.\n\n\"This reform should not be limited to greenfields agreements. Regular enterprise agreements commonly regulate work on major projects; not just greenfields agreements,\" Mr Willox said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Porter said his proposed change would reinvigorate the declining enterprise bargaining system.\n\n\"The government is looking further into the enterprise bargaining process to identify the bottlenecks, eliminate unnecessary red tape and make it easier for employees and employers to make agreements,'' he said.\n\nMr Porter said an obvious beneficiary of lifetime workplace agreements would be Woodside's Burrup Hub natural gas development which is estimated to create 4000 jobs and boost the economy by $414 billion over the next 45 years.\n\nAfter the election, Prime Minister Scott Morrison charged Mr Porter with developing a new industrial relations agenda but said all policies must be evidence-based rather than ideological, must strengthen the economy, and protect workers' rights.\n\nCoalition MPs eager for industrial relations reform have welcomed initiatives such as the greenfields policy but insist that real reform must extend across the workforce to improve productivity, not just the niche area of big projects.\n\nAlso a month ago, the government released a policy paper designed to crack down on wage theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n,", "description": "The federal government will move ahead with IR laws that will set the same wages and conditions for the construction lifetime of new major projects,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1751%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_57/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b6d9d2e74cda03cc775b91936f4199e2fb72220a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
