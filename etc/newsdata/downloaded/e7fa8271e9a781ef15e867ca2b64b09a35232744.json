REUTERS/Hamad l Mohammed/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Satellite imagery of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq oil processing plant, which was damaged in an attack on Sept. 14, show signs of a return to thermal activity, data analytics firm Kayrros said on Thursday.\n\nKayrros also said that flaring - the burning of gas from oilfields - was at \u201cusual minimal levels\u201d at Ghawar, Khurais and Abqaiq.\n\nThe low flaring levels are in line with the resumption of gas compression activities at the Abqaiq plant, highlighting Saudi Aramco attempts to restore production levels, Kayrros said.\n\nSources told Reuters on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia has restored oil production capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day, maintaining a faster than expected recovery after the Sept. 14 attacks on its facilities.\n\n\u201cOf the five NGL (natural gas liquids) compression units identified by Kayrros, three units show signs of thermal activity, hinting NGL compression is resuming,\u201d Kayrros said.\n\nThe images taken on Wednesday also show thermal activity at another unit, which could be an amine sweetening unit, Kayrros added.", "description": "Satellite imagery of Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq oil processing plant, which was damaged in an attack on Sept. 14, show signs of a return to thermal activity, data analytics firm Kayrros said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434075362&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0KV", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
