The Trump administration appears to be taking a strong non-proliferation stance toward nuclear cooperation with the kingdom.\n\nDated Sept. 4, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry James (Rick) Richard PerryOvernight Energy: Farmers say EPA reneged on ethanol deal | EPA scrubs senators' quotes from controversial ethanol announcement | Perry unsure if he'll comply with subpoena | John Kerry criticizes lack of climate talk at debate Rick Perry doesn't know if he'll comply with congressional subpoena Mulvaney helped organize controversial Ukraine meeting MORE sent a letter to Saudi Arabia calling for a \u201cgold standard\u201d 123 Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with the Saudis that would, \u201ccontain a commitment by the kingdom to forgo any enrichment and reprocessing for the term of the agreement.\u201d\n\nA 123 Agreement refers to section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and it includes nine nonproliferation criteria such as \u201cnothing transferred is used for any nuclear explosive device.\u201d The \u201cgold standard\u201d is an additional \u201clegally binding obligation\u201d to foreswear enrichment and reprocessing technology. The addition of such a standard is critical because these technologies are dual-use, meaning the components of a Saudi civil nuclear program can also be used to build a Saudi nuclear weapons program.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSecretary Perry\u2019s letter, it seems, received a public response by Saudi Arabia\u2019s newly appointed Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman about a week later as he reiterated the kingdom\u2019s intention to master the full nuclear fuel cycle.\n\nDespite their stated interest in civil nuclear energy, the threat of nuclear proliferation from the Saudis is a real one. Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman is on record saying, \u201cSaudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\u201d Even if the Saudis retract that statement, it is clear that the United States should do everything in its power to put reasonable safeguards on a Saudi nuclear energy program.\n\nThe administration\u2019s position may have improved in this regard, but Congress needs to do its part. The only current legislation moving forward and nearing adequate oversight is Rep. Brad Sherman Bradley (Brad) James ShermanCritics pounce as Facebook crypto project stumbles This week: Congress returns to chaotic Washington Trump impeachment efforts will haunt the next Democrat in the White House MORE\u2019s (D-Calif.) amendment in the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This amendment would require Saudi Arabia to sign the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) Additional Protocol, which enables the nuclear watchdog to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material and ensures its ability to inspect undeclared nuclear material and activities. While this is a start, it is not enough.\n\nFortunately, more substantive legislation already exists in the form of the bipartisan and bicameral Saudi Nuclear Nonproliferation Act. This legislation was originally introduced to insert Congress into the Saudi nuclear cooperation conversation when it seemed that the White House might not require Saudi Arabia to forgo the right to enrich or reprocess weapons-grade nuclear fuel. The bill would require the \u201cgold standard\u201d in any 123 Agreement with the Saudis, as well as the accession to the Additional Protocol with the IAEA. It would also require that the agreement receives a joint resolution of approval instead of passive consent, as is the standard with other civil nuclear agreements.\n\nThe bill is now languishing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. While there may have originally been Republican apprehension to legislate a rebuke of the administration\u2019s position toward Saudi Arabia, Secretary Perry\u2019s recent letter shows that the Executive and the Legislative branches are now of the same opinion. There is no longer a reason to delay.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd of course, as with any foreign policy matter, no policy choice exists in a vacuum. The United States already has one \u201cgold standard\u201d 123 Agreement in the region with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Despite agreeing to forgo enrichment, the UAE was able to add a provision to its 123 Agreement stipulating that if any regional countries subsequently got a more favorable deal, then they would be free to renegotiate their own. Congress must be aware that choices the United States makes with Saudi Arabia will have a ripple effect around the Middle East.\n\nThe path ahead should be obvious, but there are complications. The United States is not the only country competing for the multi-billion-dollar nuclear energy contract with Saudi Arabia. France, South Korea, Russia and China are all on the short list, and as of yet, none has asked Saudi Arabia to foreswear any dual-use technology. This seems irresponsible in the wake of Saudi threats to develop a new nuclear weapons program, but it would not be the first time economic interests outweighed security interests. Congress must be prepared for opponents of a \u201cgold standard\u201d deal with Saudi Arabia to push back on these particular grounds. No matter the cost, preventing proliferation should be a top priority of Congress.\n\nIt will be key for Congress to stand firm on this issue especially because the Trump Administration has proven itself to be inconsistent on policy stances, particularly in matters of foreign policy. It could very well reverse course and sign a 123 Agreement with Saudi Arabia that does not meet the \u201cgold standard.\u201d That is why leaders in Congress need to take the lead by cementing Secretary Perry\u2019s written stance through the Saudi Nuclear Nonproliferation Act. It could make all the difference in preventing a new regional nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\n\nSamuel M. Hickey is a Research Analyst at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.
