They missed paychecks and endured increasingly cold temperatures waiting for any sign of concessions.\n\nAD\n\nThe deal is not yet final and its details are scant. Workers will get to vote on it, but not until the 175 or so union leaders from GM facilities around the country meet Thursday in Detroit to approve it first.\n\nSo, at least until then, the strike goes on.\n\nWith more than 1 million days of work lost, the strike is one of the largest in the past 25 years, part of a surge of activity that has seen both unions and other worker groups from fast-food to tech companies become more energized than any other time in recent memory. A favorable deal for workers could help inspire more.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve almost forgotten what a strike is in this country,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cAnd yet in the last several years we\u2019ve we\u2019ve seen an upsurge of strikes and labor actions \u2014 in effect a reaction about the uncertainty and vulnerability that so many workers feel. I think this strike of the UAW and GM really builds on that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe strike has captivated the world of politics, with picket lines serving as a stage \u2014 and debate prompt \u2014 for the 2020 Democratic race\u2019s leading candidates.\n\nBut signs of the strike\u2019s economic toll have been growing in recent weeks. Layoffs in auto manufacturing zones have spanned from the Midwest to Canada and Mexico, raising fears that the strike could tip vulnerable areas into localized recessions.\n\nThose concerns have been pronounced in Michigan, home to about 20,000 striking GM workers, and hardscrabble cities such as Flint, where numerous companies and families rely on auto manufacturing.\n\nAD\n\nThe Anderson Economic Group, a Lansing-based consultancy, estimates that 75,000 workers have been laid off or had their hours reduced because of the strike, about half of those in Michigan. The group\u2019s analysts estimate that losses have piled up for GM workers, who have lost $835 million in wages, and the federal government, which has lost $313 million in income and payroll taxes.\n\nMichigan lost $18.5 million in tax revenue, they estimate. The State\u2019s Department of Labor says it processed 7,000 unemployment claims for auto industry workers between Sept. 15 and Oct. 5 \u2014 a vast increase over the 400 it processed in the same time period in 2018.\n\nParts suppliers that have had reported layoffs include Adient, Cooper-Standard, American Axle & Manufacturing, Magna, ZF North American, Busche Performance Products, and Android Industries. In Flint alone, companies like Lear Corp., a seating and electrical parts producer, Universal Dedicated Transportation Services, Jane Worthing Genesee Packaging, have had layoffs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt union halls in Flint, workers, who have been getting by on $250 paychecks from the UAW in lieu of their paychecks, stopped by to pick up food boxes donated by United Way on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t been spending no money. Just hanging out. Just staying around the house,\u201d John Brooks, 67, a GM worker of 51 years, said outside the UAW Local 659\u2019s building. \u201cYou know it\u2019s hard, man. The house note, the car note, kids in school. I have a little nest egg, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been dipping in to.\u201d\n\nUnited Way of Genesee County has been filling up 800 boxes with nonperishable foods like pasta and peanut butter each week since the strike began. It also operates a hotline to help workers with dealing with other financial hurdles \u2014 such as a late mortgage, car or utility payments \u2014 which has been flooded with calls of late, CEO Jamie Gaskin said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWorkers staffing picket lines across the country have said those hardships are a small price to pay for a fairer contract with GM, which has enjoyed $35 billion in profits the past three years. But as of Wednesday it was difficult to determine how many of the UAW demands were met, or whether both sides were simply looking for a way to resolve the impasse.\n\nMany of the picketing workers said they wanted to change the tiered wage system that GM has strengthened in recent years. It now takes workers about eight years to scale up from $17 an hour to full pay, which is roughly $28 an hour. And the company\u2019s growing use of temporary workers is another point of contention. Those workers make up about seven percent of the company\u2019s workforce and often do the same work for reduced pay, fewer benefits and less job security.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGM has said it cannot afford to take on higher labor costs, noting the amount of money it spends per worker is already higher than foreign automakers, whose United States factories are not unionized. It also has pointed to the health-care benefits it gives workers \u2014 employees currently pay about three to four percent of their health-care plans, well below the national average.\n\nJoel Lock and John Garcia, electricians with 28 and 22 years of experience at GM, respectively, said they would not vote to ratify any contract that did not include provisions mandating that long-term temps be brought on as full staff.\n\nSpeaking to a reporter as they stood by a blazing fire pit outside the Flint Assembly Plant on Wednesday, they said they were surprised by how long the strike had lasted. Still, they had gotten used to the dull routine of shuttling between the picket line and their homes.\n\nGarcia said he knew the first thing he was going to do once the strike ended.\n\n\u201cGo back to work,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "Details of the agreement between the United Auto Workers and GM were scarce, but if the deal is fully approved by the union, it should end a month-long strike that had raised questions about the future of the auto industry. Workers will remain on strike until ratification.", "authors": ["Eli Rosenberg", "Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y9QGe5jCyOfIX-Snga0xYP0nUw0=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-16-2019/t_bc610dce06944e50b2a76e11297ab710_name_b1c6e9be_f02b_11e9_bb7e_d2026ee0c199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
