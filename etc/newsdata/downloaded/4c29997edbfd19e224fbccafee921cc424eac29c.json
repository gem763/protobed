WeWork\u2019s Ikea-chic, couch-and-bench-furnished open office aesthetic has also become a cultural template, the sitcom backdrop for a new generation\u2019s workplace travails. We\u2019s founders and investors now often position their company as a workplace innovator \u2014 in forcing workers from different companies to work very closely together, We was not only a business marvel but, they suggested, also a feel-good, Goopy force for planetary collaboration and unity.\n\nThen, last week, came the inevitable blow up. After finding lackluster investor interest in its business, We delayed its long-planned stock offering. On Tuesday, the company pushed out Neumann as C.E.O. The tech business site The Information reported that We is considering laying off up to a third of its work force.\n\nI\u2019ve been hung up on how all this happened: How did so many people put so much money into something so many were warning would end up so badly? What was We thinking?\n\nAnd then it hit me: We wasn\u2019t thinking.\n\nWeWork? Not really. WeCan\u2019t! We\u2019reTooDistracted!\n\nMuch will be written in the coming weeks about how WeWork failed investors and employees. But I want to spotlight another constituency. WeWork\u2019s fundamental business idea \u2014 to cram as many people as possible into swank, high-dollar office space, and then shower them with snacks and foosball-type perks so they overlook the distraction-carnival of their desks \u2014 fails office workers, too.\n\nThe model fails you even if you don\u2019t work at a WeWork, because WeWork\u2019s underlying idea has been an inspiration for a range of workplaces, possibly even your own. As urban rents crept up and the economy reached full employment over the last decade, American offices got more and more stuffed. On average, workers now get about 194 square feet of office space per person, down about 8 percent since 2009, according to a report by the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. WeWork has been accelerating the trend. At its newest offices, the company can more than double the density of most other offices, giving each worker less than 50 square feet of space.", "description": "One story from WeWork\u2019s inevitable blow-up: Our offices offer few spaces for deep work.", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/opinion/25manjooWeb/25manjooWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
