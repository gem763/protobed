It hosted a variety of events including community cooking, brunches and programs for seniors and youth.\n\nThe centre is closing because the landlord wants the property for other uses, according to the organization.\n\nManager Ruwayna Ghanem wrote on Facebook about how inclusive and diverse the project had become.\n\n\"That vision has materialized into a place, programs and most importantly relationships,\" she wrote. \"It grows organically, and it reaches many, and this is why I believe this community will and must live on.\"\n\nThe group's Facebook page is filled with comments from community members lamenting the closure.\n\nFor its final event on the weekend, Lotus Community Corner will host a brunch and barbecue, complete with speeches and games for kids.\n\nFundraising has now started for a new location. An online fundraising campaign has begun, and the search is underway for a more permanent location in the neighborhood.", "description": "After three years, the non-profit community gathering place will host its final event this weekend.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5064706.1553115995!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/baraka-syrian-homecooking-project.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
