That's right\u2014I'm talking about the former pairing known as Miley Cyrus and Kaitlynn Carter, two friends-turned-lovers who got together after splitting from their ex-mans. After six weeks of dating and displays of affection, they amicably called their relationship quits\u2014but now, we finally know why.\n\nAccording to a People source, things with Kaitlynn were getting a little too serious for Miley's liking. Miley reportedly isn't in the mood for such a big emotional commitment right now and felt like it was heading in that direction with Kaitlynn. So they ended things!\n\n\u201cMiley doesn\u2019t want a serious relationship,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe and Kaitlynn spent every day together, and it just wasn\u2019t anything that Miley wanted to continue doing. She wants to focus on her career. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, but this is ultimately what she wants.\u201d\n\nAnother alleged major red flag for Miley was that her relationship with Kaitlynn felt a little too similar to her previous relationship with Liam Hemsworth. Miley initially wanted to reclaim time for herself after separating from Liam but ended up with Kaitlynn by accident. \u201cMiley split from Liam to focus on herself. Her relationship with Kaitlynn was a happy surprise,\u201d the source added. \u201cHowever, Miley was so invested in her relationship with Liam for a long time. She felt her relationship with Kaitlynn was almost moving in that direction, too.\u201d\n\nNow that Miley and Kaitlynn are over, Miley \u201cis looking forward to being single\u201d and is focused on pursuing her interests again. Case in point: Miley's recent hiking trip through the Grand Canyon! She didn't only go there to recreate \"The Climb\" (okay, maybe that was part of it), but she also likely went there to do some post-breakup ~soul searching~.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'm just glad to see our Miley out here shinin' and thrivin'!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Ah, so that explains why they broke up!", "authors": ["Starr Bowenbank"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Dlfn_WClQ4Bg4BITCTqegw--~B/aD05ODg7dz0xOTY5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/3bba9b7c1b35c4590a57fd3b0d121c79", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
