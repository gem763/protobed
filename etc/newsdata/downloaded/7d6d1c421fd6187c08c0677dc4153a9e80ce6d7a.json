The music-streaming company is offering free Google Home Mini smart speakers to anyone paying for a Spotify subscription, which starts at $10 per month.\n\nBut the offer is limited \u2013 you\u2019ve gotta act fast! So how do you get one? Follow these simple steps:\n\nFirst things first, there are two caveats: This is a Google Home Mini, not the newly announced Nest Mini \u2026\n\ncaption The Nest Mini, above, looks almost exactly like the Home Mini from 2017 \u2014 except it has better sound quality and a headphone jack. source Google\n\nGoogle\u2019s Home Mini smart speaker, unveiled in 2017, is the one you\u2019ll get as part of Spotify\u2019s promotion, not the newly announced update to the Google Home Mini, named the Nest Mini.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle difference, but one that might matter to you if you\u2019re in the market for the newer smart speaker from Google.\n\nThat said, the Nest Mini costs $50, and the Google Home Mini through this promotion costs zero dollars.\n\n\u2026 and if you got a free Google Home Mini last year through a similar promotion, you can\u2019t get another this year.\n\nsource Spotify\n\nI learned as much when I tried snagging a second Home Mini on Tuesday morning through the promotion. Unfortunately, if you got one last year through a similar promotion, you can\u2019t get another this year. Oh well!\n\nGot it? OK, let\u2019s get to the directions!\n\n1. Log in to your Spotify account on the Spotify website.\n\nsource Spotify\n\nHead over to Spotify\u2019s website and click on either \u201cGet Individual\u201d or \u201cGet Family,\u201d depending on the type of paid Spotify account you have.\n\n2. When you click through, you\u2019ll be prompted to log in. Do that!\n\nsource Spotify\n\n3. After you\u2019ve logged in and agreed to a few standard terms of service things, Spotify will send over an email with a link to your free Google Home Mini.\n\nsource Google/Spotify\n\n4. After you\u2019ve logged in, the Google Store will open with your Google Home Mini price reduced to zero. Choose your color!\n\nsource Google\n\n5. You\u2019re all set: The Google Home Mini is yours.\n\nsource Matt Weinberger/Business Insider\n\n6. Wait patiently for the Google Home Mini to arrive.", "description": "Business Insider - Are you paying for Spotify? If you're a subscriber, you can get a free Google Home Mini just for being you!.
