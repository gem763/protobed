They either export overseas \u2013 mining magnates Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest, as well as toy manufacturer Manny Stul \u2013 or a considerable portion of their business empires are abroad. Solomon Lew's Smiggle chain is across the UK and Asia. Nigel Austin's Cotton On has pushed into Asia, Europe and the US.\n\nThe biggest mover on the list upwards is Clive Palmer, whose wealth has swelled from $344 million to $2.84 billion thanks to a win in his long-running legal battle with Citic over iron ore royalties. Palmer received a $344 million payment this year, and his valuation in the future is based on annual royalties of more than $200 million. Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar have gained the most in dollar terms. In 2017 they were each worth $2.51 billion. The rise in Atlassian's share price means they are each worth $5.16 billion now. Among the first-time billionaires are Computershare founder Chris Morris, who also owns Queensland tourism assets, and Paul Little, the Toll Holdings founder turned Melbourne property developer.\n\nAmong the debutants is Justin Hemmes, whose Sydney property and pubs empire Merivale has grown from the fashion and property empire built by his late father John. Will Vicars is a notable addition from the Sydney funds management scene, having made his fortune as chief investment officer of Caledonia Investments.\n\nRuslan Kogan returns to the list after a three-year absence, thanks to the surging share price of his kogan.com. The online retail and services group has been one of the best performers on the ASX in the past 12 months. At 35 years of age he's the youngest new name on the list.\n\n$387 million cut-off\n\nKogan's addition has helped Melbourne equal Sydney as having the same number of Rich List members (57 each). Property accounts for 51 names on the list. Retail is the second biggest category (22), investment (21) and financial services at 16.\n\nGraphic\n\nThe record cut-off of $387 million means some notable names are absent from this year's list, including movie star Nicole Kidman, media advertising powerhouse Harold Mitchell and George Koukis, the founder of fintech Temenos. It's not a case of wealth in decline, more so that others have become a lot richer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso missing this year are the late Ron Walker, Mary Fairfax and Neville Pask, while Ashley Williams, Walker's business partner in property development company Evolve, and Joy Chambers-Grundy, widow of the late Reg Grundy, have been temporarily removed subject to future wealth calculations.\n\nOne thing that hasn't changed is the average age of our Rich Listers, 66, the same as last year. Six people are aged in their 90s and there are 20 octogenarians. Succession planning has always been a key issue for our wealthiest people. The sale by the Lowy family of its stake in Westfield could be a harbinger of more Rich Listers taking their money off the table.\n\nThe Financial Review Rich List 2018 is published in the June issue of AFR Magazine, out on Friday, May 25.\n\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram", "description": "It is an unprecedented era for wealth in Australia.
