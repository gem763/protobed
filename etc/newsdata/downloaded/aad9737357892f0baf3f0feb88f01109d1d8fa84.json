The Velop WiFi 6 is available as a standalone router for $399, or you can get a pack of two for $699. Linksys says that each node can cover an area of around 3,000 square feet and that the system should be able to handle connections from over 50 devices simultaneously.\n\nThis announcement from Linksys comes a couple of months after its main rival, Netgear, announced a similar Wi-Fi 6 update to its Orbi lineup of mesh routers. Netgear\u2019s version also costs $699 for a two-pack of devices, with the quoted ability to handle connections from over 100 connected devices. However, despite Google and Amazon-owned Eero releasing updates to their mesh lineups in the past couple of months, both of them are restricted to the older 802.11ac (aka Wi-Fi 5) standard.\n\nIf you opt for Linksys\u2019 Velop WiFi 6, then you\u2019ll find four Gigabit Ethernet ports on the router (plus one input), along with a USB 3.0 Type-A port that\u2019s designed for network-attached storage. Internally, the routers include a 2.2GHz quad-core processor and offer a maximum theoretical speed of 5.3 Gbps. (Though, as always, your actual speeds are likely to be a lot less.) All told, Linksys says that the system should be four times faster than its previous Velop hardware.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve replaced all of your internet-connected devices recently, it\u2019s unlikely that many of them will be able to take advantage of the new Wi-Fi 6 standard, and you could be better served by one of Linksys\u2019 far cheaper 802.11ac systems, which start at a discounted $199 for a two-pack or $129 for a single router. However, if your devices are excessively up to date or if you\u2019re just interested in future-proofing your home, then the new Linksys Velop WiFi 6 is available to preorder as a one-pack starting today or as a two-pack, which are shipping right now.", "description": "Linksys has announced its first Velop mesh router system with support for Wi-Fi 6, which offers faster speeds and an increased range.
