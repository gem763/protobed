The fact he got up to give me a hug was a massive plus.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nChocolate bars, artificial intelligence, gay Twitter. He showed me a picture of his swollen neck when he got mumps. That was a highlight.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nWhen I told the waiter we\u2019d already ordered when we hadn\u2019t. Everyone looked a bit confused.\n\nGood table manners?\n\n10/10.\n\nBest thing about Chris?\n\nHe had a great sense of humour, and an overwhelming love for Nadine Coyle.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\nYeah, he was great craic.\n\nDescribe Chris in three words?\n\nWitty, warm, genuine.\n\nWhat do you think he made of you?\n\nHe brought up the subject of fetishes, so I assume he was comfortable around me.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nFor a pint at the pub around the corner.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nOn the cheek. It was a rather rushed goodbye on a crowded bus.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nPerhaps we would have carried on to a karaoke bar.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\nSolid 7.5.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nAs mates, for sure.\n\nChris on Joe\n\nWhat were you hoping for?\n\nA 6ft 2in rugby-playing Irishman with good facial hair.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nA 6ft 2in(ish) bold-shirted Brummie with good facial hair.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nHampstead Heath ponds, Snobs, Nadine Coyle\u2019s accent, the art of poaching an egg and Rebekah Vardy.\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nNot that I can recall.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nJoe was very good at keeping my wine topped up, and shared food impeccably. He did go to the toilet while we were still eating, though.\n\nBlind date: 'Maybe we\u2019d have had more fun separately' Read more\n\nBest thing about Joe?\n\nEnormously talkative, an easy laugh and very laid-back.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\nI think they\u2019d get on!\n\nDescribe Joe in three words?\n\nCreative, warm, ambitious.\n\nWhat do you think he made of you?\n\nA bit obsessed with getting as much free food out of the Guardian as possible.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nTo a pub for one more.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nA peck on the cheek on the bus.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nI would have gotten more free food.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n7.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nWe have messaged but I don\u2019t think there was a romantic vibe.\n\n\u2022 Joe and Chris ate at Brother Marcus, London N1.\n\nFancy a blind date?
