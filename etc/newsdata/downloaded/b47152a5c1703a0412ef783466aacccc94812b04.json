Among many questions, there was also a request for recommendation by user \u2018CorporalCrabcake\u2019 on \u201cthe ideal security setup for just your average Bitcoiner looking to make sure they don\u2019t get hacked?\u201d\n\nLopp answered this request saying that \u2018Ideal\u2019 is a relative term, so a broad reply can\u2019t really be given, since it depends on the amount of value somebody\u2019s securing. The way Lopp looks at it is: \u201cif the cost of setting up an \"ideal\" system of securing private keys is less than a few percent of the value of the coins, then it should be a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nHe gives a few more detailed pointers based on his personal opinions, as well as on various tiers offered at Casa:\n\nFor securing amounts worth more than USD 1,000 \u2013 buying a hardware wallet is the bare minimum; he currently recommends ColdCard wallet, though he says that any popular wallet should be fine. (Check out a list of alternative hardware wallets).\n\n\u2013 buying a hardware wallet is the bare minimum; he currently recommends wallet, though he says that any popular wallet should be fine. (Check out a list of alternative hardware wallets). For securing amounts worth more than USD 10,000 \u2013 use multisignature (multisig), preferably with the keys held by different brands of hardware wallets.\n\n\u2013 use multisignature (multisig), preferably with the keys held by different brands of hardware wallets. For securing amounts worth more than USD 100,000 \u2013 think about how geographically distributed you want the different devices to be, and possibly use a \"higher M of N multisig setup for greater robustness,\" says the expert.\n\nAnswering questions by Redditor \u2018eYou\u2019, Lockhart said that with multisig, users are spreading risk across multiple keys, but \u201cthe higher the amount protected, the higher [number] of keys you should require in order to sign a transaction.\u201d He added that a mix of key storage devices - mobile key and one or more hardware wallets - is recommended either way, while mixing the brands of hardware wallet \u201cis not a bad idea, and can protect against possible issues with a specific manufacturer.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Casa came out with a couple of announcements in the past few days. In a blog post, the two experts addressed concerns regarding rumored vulnerabilities in Casa Node 1, a plug-and-play Bitcoin and Lightning node. They said that these are known issues that resulted from intentional design decisions, but that there\u2019s no need to remove funds from your Casa Node. Furthermore, Casa Node 2 is already out as it was previously announced.\n\nRelated to the online security, the annual Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) for 2019 by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) is also out. The report states that \u201cwhile cryptocurrencies continue to facilitate cybercrime, hackers and fraudsters now routinely target crypto-assets and enterprise.\u201d Among the main conclusions, the report finds that:\n\nGangs use Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)-style tactics to take control over certain aspects of a bank\u2019s internal network, and nation states are sometimes involved; for example the Lazarus group, which has ties to North Korea, was allegedly responsible for over half a billion USD in cryptocurrency thefts since 2017.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are still a magnet for hacking groups, and last year, over USD 1 billion in cryptocurrencies were stolen from exchanges and other platforms worldwide.\n\nThere was a massive surge in cryptomining, both passive (through scripts running in a victim\u2019s internet browser) and via cryptojacking malware. \u201cBoth techniques exploit a victim\u2019s processing power without their permission to mine cryptocurrencies \u2014 typically Monero,\u201d says the report. With the closure of Coinhive in March, browser-based cryptomining declined, but the attacks against public and private sectors entities are evolving. \u201cApart from the occasional exceptional case, cryptomining is likely to remain a low-priority threat for EU law enforcement.\u201d\n\nTo combat the crimes and high adaptability of those who perform them, the IOCTA says that:", "description": "Answering a question in a recent AMA (ask me anything) session on protecting one\u2019s Bitcoin from thieves, experts from crypto security specialist Casa gave what may be an ideal security setup for any average BTC holder, based on the amount they\u2019re securing.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/7084a7ea70.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
