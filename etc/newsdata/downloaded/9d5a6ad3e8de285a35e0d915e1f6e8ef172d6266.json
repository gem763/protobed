The Democratic chairmen of the house intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs committees wrote to the White House and state department seeking records related to what they described as efforts to \u201cmanipulate the Ukrainian justice system\u201d.\n\nThe move came after reports that Mr Giuliani, the former New York mayor who has been advising Mr Trump on legal matters, has been pressuring Mr Zelensky to open proceedings into claims made by Republicans that Mr Biden acted unfairly to help his son, Hunter, in business dealings.\n\nMr Giuliani had been liaising with prosecutors in Kiev appointed by Mr Zelensky\u2019s predecessors, to look into the company Hunter Biden worked for, and the oligarch who owned it.\n\nOn Thursday night Mr Giuliani insisted to CNN\u2019 that he didn\u2019t ask Ukrainian officials to investigate Mr Biden, but 30 seconds later said \u201cof course\u201d he did.\n\nOn Friday, before the revelations in Journal, Mr Trump claimed the whistleblower was \u201cpartisan\u201d, while also insisting he had done nothing wrong.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Apparently made by a US intelligence officer who was listening in to a call between Mr Trump and a world leader, it was classed as \u201cserious\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d by the intelligence watchdog.\n\nHowever, the acting director of national intelligence has so far refused demands from congress to reveal the exact nature of the complaint.\n\nThe Trump administration has denied links between a $250m (\u00a3200m) aid payment to Ukraine and the provision of negative information about Mr Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings in the east European country.\n\nMr Trump insisted the person who made the complaint against him was \u201cpartisan\u201d before admitting he did not know their identity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower, we just know that it was a partisan person, meaning they come from a different party,\u201d adding that he \u201cfights so hard for this country\u201d.\n\nWhen asked again if he knew anything about the whistleblower, the president, visibly annoyed, fired back: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the media, figure it out.\u201d And in response to a question over whether the complaint involved Ukraine, he said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe said he was under no obligation to explain what he discussed with Mr Zelensky in one of several phone conversations with world leaders made in the days before the complaint was filed, saying: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed, but I will say this: somebody ought to look into Joe Biden\u2019s statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he\u2019s not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case.\n\n\u201cSo, somebody ought to look into that. And you wouldn\u2019t, because he\u2019s a Democrat. And the \u2018fake news\u2019 doesn\u2019t look into things like that. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nMr Trump will meet Mr Zelensky at the United Nations general assembly in New York next week where, a US administration official told reporters, he will congratulate him on his anti-corruption efforts.\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, has threatened to sue the administration if intelligence officials do not share the complaint. He said it was unprecedented for the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to refuse to share the briefing with congress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get an answer to the question about whether the White House is also involved in preventing this information from coming to congress,\u201d Mr Schiff said. \u201cWe\u2019re determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is to make sure that the national security is protected.\u201d\n\nDemocratic congressman Jim Himes, who serves on the intelligence committee, told CNN he would not be surprised if Mr Trump was indeed having an \u201cinappropriate\u201d conversation with a foreign leader, but was concerned by the news that the complaint involved a promise. \u201cWhat would make it corrupt or illegal,\u201d he said, is that promise.\n\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Trump faced \u201cserious repercussions\u201d if the reports were accurate, saying the complaint raises \u201cgrave, urgent concerns for our national security\u201d.", "description": "Donald Trump reportedly repeatedly pressured Ukraine\u2019s new leader to launch an investigation into the son of the man the US president may face off again in 2020.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/20/18/gettyimages-1169841399-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
