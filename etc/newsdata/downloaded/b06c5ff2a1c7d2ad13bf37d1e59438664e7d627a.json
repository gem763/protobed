Opening number, Ricardo Amarante\u2019s Love Fear Loss, deploys their trademark litheness across three neoclassical duets set to piano versions of Edith Piaf songs. The sweeping lifts of Hymne \u00e0 l\u2019amour channel new love\u2019s delights, while Ne me quitte pas transmits the ache of a breakup with urgent tilting extensions. It\u2019s a graceful offering that sings on the intimate Linbury stage, particularly in the final moments of Mon Dieu, when Ilya Manayenkov sends Ainur Abilgazina skittering across a dusky netherworld.\n\nMukaram Avakhri\u2019s Salom\u00e9, by contrast, packs the stage with snaking shoulders and splayed legs, odes to the eroticism of Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1891 play. The effect is cluttered, with dozens of dancers jostling for space around a chunky platform. There\u2019s oomph to the leap-heavy group routines, but the ballet is let down by underwhelming characterisations, including Abilgazina\u2019s crotch-pumping Salom\u00e9. Avakhri\u2019s choreography errs on the side of indignity, epitomised in an ungainly love scene with the decapitated John the Baptist.\n\nAmarante\u2019s A Fuego Lento fares better, with its tango-style tessellations. The men in particular fizz, even when they step out of time. There\u2019s a similar buzz in Heritage of the Great Steppe, a parade of \u201cchoreographic miniatures\u201d showcasing regional specialities. The Kazakh folk dances shine, bringing creaturely port de bras and a delicate calligraphy of hand gestures. Anel Baltenova\u2019s dazzling watermelon gown in her solo, Joy, just about forgives the ropey get-ups of Motherland, which look like pound-shop Game of Thrones gear.\n\nAstana was formed under a state-sponsored initiative to promote Kazakhstani arts abroad, and this programme seems like a consciously sundry, see-what-sticks exercise. The contemporary work on show is a mixed bag, but there\u2019s a lot of spring to their classical step.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s the dance that does the heavy lifting here\u2019: Tamara Rojo and James Streeter in Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian\n\nOver at Sadler\u2019s Wells, English National Ballet has reprised Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle, created in 2016 and now a highlight in the company\u2019s touring catalogue. It\u2019s outcasts-against-landlords in this stormy production, which twists Th\u00e9ophile Gautier\u2019s Romantic masterpiece into a contemporary morality tale about wealth inequality. It\u2019s bold and insightful, with a nail-biting climax of supernatural revenge.\n\nENB supernova Tamara Rojo serves up a gritty, robust Giselle, styled here as a migrant worker whose affair with aristocrat Albrecht (James Streeter on superb form) ends in desertion, death and drama in the underworld. Arms cocked to the sky, she leads the proletariat in a lurching dance of dispossession with beastly gallops and swaying ripples of bodies. Stina Quagebeur raises the bar for formidable in her turn as Myrtha, queen of the dead, a ghostly coven scuttling in tow.\n\nThe plotting is blotchy, but it\u2019s the dance that does the heavy lifting here. Khan braids contractions, spirals and quickfire footwork to create a rich weave of ballet and kathak styles. This dynamic choreography, coupled with a spectacular set and Vincenzo Lamagna\u2019s searing score, reaffirms Khan as a connoisseur of drama. The slow reveal of the ruling class in Act 1, wreathed in shadow and gilded to the hilt, is especially spine-tingling.\n\nStar ratings (out of five)\n\nAstana Ballet \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nEnglish National Ballet: Akram Khan\u2019s Giselle \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAkram Khan\u2019s Giselle is at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 28 September", "description": "Astana\u2019s springy young Kazakhs make their UK debut, while Tamara Rojo weaves her magic with Akram Khan\u2019s insightful Giselle", "authors": ["Sara Veale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f54faf33b6064eca7554aa40d2201a0ac06a28f/0_111_4547_2730/master/4547.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b399cee3f56d5f8bbee21e8bd0d08531", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
