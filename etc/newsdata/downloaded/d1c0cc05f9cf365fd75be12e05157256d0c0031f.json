Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) asked McAleenan about reports this week that the White House could attempt to rewrite the order of succession at DHS to install hard-liner Ken Cuccinelli at the head of the department, devising an elaborate workaround to rules established by the Vacancies Reform Act.\n\nCuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is a favorite of the president\u2019s, but the Justice Department has told the White House that Cuccinelli is not eligible for the job under current rules.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn your final hours as acting secretary, do you have any plans to change the current line of succession at DHS?\u201d Rice asked.\n\nMcAleenan said he could not discuss \u201cpre-decisional deliberations,\u201d but when pressed by Rice, he told her \u201cI have no plans to do that.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan has served in an interim role at DHS since April, when Trump ousted then-secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in frustration with a migration surge at the U.S. southern border.\n\nUnder McAleenan, border crossings have fallen by two-thirds, as DHS has restricted access to the U.S. immigration system for asylum seekers and enlisted Mexican authorities to help with the migration crackdown.\n\nAlthough Trump did not nominate McAleenan for confirmation, the White House has praised his immigration record and demonstrated no urgency to replace him, despite his desire to leave at the end of October.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and other GOP senators have indicated they would not vote to confirm Cuccinelli, but some of the president\u2019s supporters are urging the White House to find a way to install him anyway.\n\nAD", "description": "Nearly three weeks after McAleenan submitted a resignation letter, the White House has not chosen anyone to lead the Department of Homeland Security after he leaves.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TgIlJOcT-sALfHc_gROxl6Uoigc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AOS6AKH3KMI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
