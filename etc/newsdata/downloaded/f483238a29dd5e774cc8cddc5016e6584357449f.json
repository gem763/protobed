Before June, job openings hadn\u2019t decreased year over year since early 2017.\n\n\u201cIf this downturn is a longer trend, it could be quite worrying,\u201d said Julia Pollak, labor economist at employment site ZipRecruiter. \u201cIt shows that demand for labor is falling.\u201d\n\nOpenings peaked at 7.6 million in November and have decreased by about 400,000 since then.\n\nStill, the number of available jobs remains high. Job openings exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by 1.2 million in July, the 17th straight month openings have outnumbered job seekers.\n\nEmployees are taking note: The rate at which workers quit their jobs ticked up to 2.4% in July after holding steady at 2.3% for 13 straight months, a sign of worker confidence in the job market.\n\nMore Americans leaving their jobs also bodes well for wage growth, as workers gain bargaining power when they move from one job to another. Year-over-year growth in average hourly earnings has been above 3% for more than a year after lagging for much of the economic expansion.\n\nAs long as openings exceed available workers, employees hold a fair amount of leverage, said Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab economist.\n\n\u201cIf we do continue to see a significant slowdown in employer demand, we\u2019re going to be less likely to see these pickups in job hopping,\u201d he said.\n\nA pullback in openings aligns with other labor-market signals pointing to a slowdown, such as hiring. The U.S. economy added an average of 156,000 new jobs a month over the past three. That was down from average growth of 190,000 a month for the eight years since employment started picking up after the last recession.\n\nThe unemployment rate, at 3.7%, is historically low, but little changed from 3.8% a year earlier. Between 2010 and 2018, by contrast, it fell on average 0.6 percentage point a year.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com", "description": "The number of job openings decreased in July from a year earlier for the second consecutive month, underscoring slowing demand for new workers, though opportunities remain plentiful for job seekers.", "authors": ["Sarah Chaney", "Sarah.Chaney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105637/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
