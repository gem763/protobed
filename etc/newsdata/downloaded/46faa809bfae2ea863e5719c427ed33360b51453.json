What do you think? pic.twitter.com/uaKYmu1MnU \u2014 Travis Shreffler (@TravisShreffler) October 18, 2019\n\nA spokesperson for Twitch confirmed the email is being sent to a mix of affiliates and partners for the first test group.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely interest. As Travis Shreffler, the streamer who posted the tweets in the first place, pointed out: a couple springs ago, Twitch had a Power Rangers marathon of every episode, and let streamers co-stream it with their communities for a cool social watching experience. \u201cYou saw a lot of streamers, myself included, doing MST3K-style commentary of episodes,\u201d Shreffler writes in an email to The Verge. \u201cI\u2019ve had multiple people say they want to do \u2018The Boys with The Boys.\u2019 When season 2 of Amazon\u2019s The Boys comes out, they\u2019re going to get together and binge it with their friends.\u201d\n\nAllowing streamers to feature shows also promises to bring new channels onto Twitch. Watch-alongs will probably become a more regular feature of the site as digital rights and permissions get figured out. The move likely comes in response to pressure from Twitch\u2019s competitors \u2014 namely Caffeine, the live-streaming platform that\u2019s currently in beta that\u2019s attracted a $100 million investment from 21st Century Fox. (It seems likely that Caffeine\u2019s plans include giving their streamers at least some access to some of 21st Century Fox\u2019s catalog.)\n\nWhile Twitch hosts many different kinds of streamers on its platform \u2014 and has recently beefed up its investments in sports and music content \u2014 the service is primarily known for its core focus on video games.\n\nAllowing streamers the ability to access Amazon\u2019s content library is a savvy move, and seems like a new front on the ongoing streaming wars; the fight for content libraries now necessarily has to include digital streaming rights. Twitch has Amazon\u2019s deep pockets and attractive original films and television; Caffeine has Fox, which has exclusive sports and music rights that other services don\u2019t have; YouTube has its billions of hours of video. While Twitch also has a first-mover advantage as the most popular streaming site in the world, it also needs to convince consumers that it\u2019s for more than games.\n\nTwitch needs to convince consumers that it\u2019s for more than games\n\nStreamers have already figured that out. People have been streaming things illicitly on Twitch for a while \u2014 if you visit its Just Chatting category and scroll for a minute, you\u2019ll find people streaming dubbed anime in Russian, for example, among the ubiquitous vloggers.\n\nSome of these people are just pirating video, but enough are trying to provide transformative commentary that it seems clear there\u2019s an appetite among streamers for a legal way to comment on live TV or event viewing. Earlier this year, some well-known streamers earned copyright strikes on their accounts because they streamed a political debate; they cited fair use, but the corporation hosting the event thought otherwise.", "description": "Twitch has begun testing a new feature called \"Watch Parties,\" which appears to allow streamers the ability to stream content from Amazon Prime to their viewers (who also have Amazon Prime). \"Watch Parties brings Prime Video to Twitch,\" the announcement said. \"You can watch a selection of Prime Video movies and TV shows on your channel with any of your viewers who have Prime.\"", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UdS1ilgtRcBYwn6ufAG4TCmItQ=/0x172:2400x1429/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19234617/01_Twitch_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
