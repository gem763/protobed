A tiny implant helps reduce pressure - and you can even go home the same day\n\niStent inject\u00ae is not only the world\u2019s smallest medical implant known to be implanted in the human body \u2013 it\u2019s also part of a revolution in glaucoma treatment.\n\nOften called the \u2018silent thief of sight\u2019 - glaucoma can lead to sight loss, even blindness, if it\u2019s not diagnosed and treated early. Around half a million people in the UK are currently diagnosed with glaucoma. A serious, progressive eye disease, it usually occurs when the optic nerve is damaged by an increase in pressure of the fluid in the eye when that fluid can\u2019t drain away properly.\n\nThe most common treatment is prescription eye drops. However, eye drops need to be applied up to three times a day, every day, so compliance can become an issue, and they can cause discomfort.\n\nBut there is an alternative: trabecular micro-bypass surgery. It involves implanting two tiny 0.36mm iStent inject\u00ae devices into the eye and can be carried out at the same time as cataract surgery, or during a separate procedure usually under local anaesthetic by an ophthalmologist.\n\nThe Info: For more information, click here.\n\nTreat the cause of acid reflux without drugs\n\nlf you suffer from acid reflux or snoring a new neuromuscular treatment from Sweden, IQoro, can strengthen the weak muscles that cause these problems.\n\nlf you suffer from acid reflux or snoring, a new neuromuscular treatment from Sweden, IQoro, can strengthen the weak muscles that cause these problems.\n\nAcid reflux can make your days and nights miserable and be damaging the soft tissue in your throat.
