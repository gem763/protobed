Some bear the names of folks Walter knew; some have faded to illegibility; some are in pieces. And, under the brush he\u2019s cleared away and the ground he\u2019s leveled, there are burial sites unmarked by any stone.\n\nThe cemetery means so much to Walter because his extended family \u2013 the Tuckers of Tidewater, Virginia \u2013 believe they are as much an American founding family as any from the Mayflower.\n\nThey have a widely recognized but possibly unprovable claim: that they are directly descended from the first identified African American people born on the mainland of English America, an infant baptized \u201cWilliam\u201d around 1624.\n\nIt\u2019s been 400 years this August since William\u2019s parents arrived in the Virginia colony. The Tuckers, like many African Americans, struggle to trace their roots. They have no genealogical or DNA evidence linking them to those first Africans, but they have oral history and family lore.\n\nAnd they have the cemetery, a repository of what unites them and what baffles them.\n\nThis graveyard, Walter says, is \u201cthe only thing you can actually put your hands on, put your eyes on.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s thinking of that July day two years ago. He was leveling earth when the blade of his shovel hit something solid.\n\nHe looked down. A round, gray object seemed to have emerged from the dirt. He dug under it a little and lifted it up. It looked like a section of a bowl.\n\nHe moved more dirt and spotted something else round and gray. He brushed it off and held it against the first object to see if they fit together.\n\nHe didn\u2019t realize it at first, but he was holding a human skull.\n\nResearchers would conclude that it belonged to an African American woman who was about 60 when she died \u2013 roughly Walter's age. But they couldn\u2019t say when.\n\nThat night, the woman was all Walter could think about. She embodied every question, every possibility, about his family\u2019s origins. And he\u2019d held her in his bare hands.\n\nShow caption Hide caption In 1896 the Tucker family cemetery was purchased by Thomas Tucker and five other men for $100.

It's a place that had long been used by the Tucker family and is being preserved for generations to come. The new gravestone honors a woman whose remains were found a few years ago. Andrea Brunty, USA TODAY Network\n\nThe \u201820 and odd\u2019\n\nThe Tuckers want to know their story because our stories help define us. Especially those that explain where we came from.\n\nMany Americans can find out from a Norddeutscher Lloyd Line manifest or an Ellis Island log or a parish registry in Cork, Palermo or Cornwall. For African Americans, it\u2019s not so easy. Their story, often as not, was stripped from them.\n\nThis is a story about one family\u2019s search for its story. It\u2019s about a storyteller who loved that story maybe too much; the searchers following in her path; and the mysterious old cemetery that, some feel, holds the key.\n\nThe Tuckers believe their American story started in 1619. According to a letter by the tobacco planter John Rolfe, the widower of Pocahontas, a ship landed in England\u2019s 12-year-old Jamestown settlement and \u201cbrought not anything but 20, and odd, Negroes, which the Governor and the Cape Merchant bought for victuals\u2019\u2019 \u2013 provisions.\n\nThe \u201c20 and odd\u2019\u2019 already had been through hell.\n\nThey were taken prisoner of war in what is now Angola by African mercenaries working with the Portuguese; marched to the Atlantic coast, where they were branded, penned, forcibly baptized; and finally chained head-to-foot below deck on a Spanish ship headed for Mexico and a life of slavery.\n\nThe San Juan Bautista carried about 350 enslaved people, more than a third of whom died on the crossing. Then, in the Gulf of Mexico, the ship was attacked by two English privateers \u2013 pirates under a foreign flag of convenience. The two ships carried about 60 of the Africans north toward Virginia.\n\nIllustration of 1619 slave ship landing in Virginia. Illustration by Sheldon Sneed\n\nVirginia had no law to permit or ban slavery. But the Africans became slaves in fact, if not law. In 1624, two of them, identified as Anthony and Isabella, were listed in the household of Capt. William Tucker, a military commander and settler.\n\nThe following year, the two appear again in a census, this time along with \u201cWilliam theire Child Baptised.\u2019\u2019 Another African child, unnamed, also appears for the first time in the same 1625 census. But William is the first identified by name.\n\nThe Tuckers believe that he is their founding father; that William was surnamed Tucker, after Capt. Tucker; and that their ancestors lived on or near Bluebird Gap Farm, site of Capt.Tucker\u2019s plantation, in what is today the city of Hampton.\n\nBut the Tuckers have so far been unable to prove their claims to the satisfaction of most historians and genealogists.\n\nAn African Ancestry DNA test for a family elder, Floyd Tucker, showed that his DNA coincided with that found in a tribe in what is today Ghana \u2013 not Angola, from where William\u2019s parents came.\n\nHow '20 and odd' enslaved Africans became millions Explore the graphic\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how far William\u2019s line goes forward, and how far the Tuckers\u2019 goes back. A professional historian hired by the family has yet to find anything to narrow the gap.\n\nOne problem is that England\u2019s American colonists kept poor records; settlers were more concerned about making it through winter or fighting Indians. Often, what records were kept subsequently were destroyed, by everything from fire to worms.\n\nToday, experts say that any family \u2013 white or black \u2013 is hard-pressed to establish genealogical connections before 1800 unless their ancestors were rich, famous or criminals.\n\nJust because the Tuckers can\u2019t document their connection doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have one, said Beth Austin of the Hampton History Museum. \u201cBut it\u2019s really still just a theory. That\u2019s all we can go on.\u201d\n\nDid William survive infancy in the precarious colony? Did he have children? Did his children have children? Regardless, he was the symbolic beginning of so much in American life \u2013 of the hands that picked the cotton that financed the Industrial Revolution; of jazz and gospel and hip-hop; of Ellison and Baldwin and Morrison; of King and Malcolm and Fannie Lou Hamer; of the Afro, the high-five and the dunk shot.\n\nAnd yet, after he was baptized \u2013 on a date and in a place unknown \u2013 history\u2019s first identified African American simply vanished.\n\nAn American griot\n\nNone of the Tuckers loved the story like Thelma Williams.\n\nAs a child she\u2019d listen for hours to her grandmother, who\u2019d been born sometime in the last quarter of the 19th century. The old woman told of family recipes and remedies, about slave uprisings and Indian wars. While other children played or did their chores, Thelma listened, rapt.\n\nOf all these stories, her grandmother told her, there was one she had to remember: We were on the first slave ship to come to America, and we are descended from the first black child born here.\n\nThe girl was skeptical. How do you know, grandma? In a 1998 interview with The Associated Press, she recalled the answer: \u201cDon\u2019t you know that if you take a dog down the street, he\u2019ll find his way home? Well, child, we\u2019re human beings and we\u2019re much more intelligent than animals. We need to know where we came from. And if we put our minds to it, we always find our way home.\u2019\u2019\n\nShow caption Hide caption Many members of the Tucker family still live within miles of the place they believe their ancestors first landed at Point Comfort, now Fort Monroe... Many members of the Tucker family still live within miles of the place they believe their ancestors first landed at Point Comfort, now Fort Monroe Monument. Whether near or far, they meet regularly to celebrate milestones like Carol Tucker Jones 88th birthday. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nAlthough the idea that the Tuckers went back to the first Africans in America had circulated in the family for years, it was slowly dying until Thelma grew up and got her hands on it.\n\nShe spent days in courthouses and libraries across eastern Virginia, checking birth records and deeds. She tracked down family elders, usually leaving the visit with a photograph or two. She went to Richmond. She went to Washington. She filled a spare bedroom in her small house in Hampton with her research, including stacks of handwritten notes.\n\nHelp us record black history and American history Our family stories often define us.

There had been a child of the first Africans who\u2019d lived in the household of a white man named Tucker. Tucker had a plantation near what is today a public park in Hampton called Blueberry Gap Farm. And once, when an elderly Tucker was brought by his children to the farm, he blurted out, \u201cThis was our home.\u2019\u2019\n\nThelma came to understand, she told the AP, the importance of the Tuckers\u2019 connection to that first African child: \u201cIt\u2019s important that people know we didn\u2019t just fall out of the sky.\u2019\u2019\n\nThelma recorded this and all sorts of other family stories: that Capt. Tucker had William baptized, stood as his godfather and gave him his surname; that William eventually obtained his freedom (from indentured servitude, not slavery), married (possibly to a woman of mixed race) and moved to New Kent County, where he had children and owned land.\n\nThe Tucker family gathers for photos to celebrate Carol Tucker Jones' 88th birthday. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nThe younger Tuckers began to pay attention, especially Thelma\u2019s cousin Wanda. Wanda remembers the older woman\u2019s excitement: \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what I just found!\u2019\u2019\n\nThelma\u2019s children sometimes resented their mother\u2019s obsession. Her husband accused her of \u201cliving in the past.\u2019\u2019 She\u2019d find a way to turn any conversation around to family history and genealogy. She\u2019d accost acquaintances at the grocery store to fill them in on what she\u2019d discovered. When she learned your last name, she\u2019d tell you what plantation your people lived on.\n\nOne of her daughters laughs at the memory: \u201cNobody liked it!\u2019\u2019\n\nBlack history and a trip to Angola: Wanda Tucker's search for answers Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nUndaunted, Thelma handed out a synopsis of the Tucker story at family reunions. She spoke to community groups and anyone else who\u2019d listen, including the mailman.\n\nHer efforts were responsible, in 1994, for the family\u2019s official recognition in the Jamestown Settlement history park\u2019s reenactment of the 375th anniversary of the Africans\u2019 arrival.\n\nA replica of that first ship, the White Lion, sailed up the James River. Some of the Tuckers, in period dress, were on board, honored as founding Americans. Thelma stood on the riverbank in a purple dashiki, beaming.\n\nThe event cemented the Tuckers\u2019 status as \u201cthe first family.\u2019\u2019 The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk described the Tuckers flatly as \u201cthe descendants of the first Africans born in North America.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Tuckers became the face of 1619. A group photo of them was featured on a National Park Service brochure for visitors to the spot where the first Africans landed.\n\nBut Thelma was a paradox: She loved the Tucker story so much, she coveted it. And because she coveted it, she tried to protect it.\n\nChris Diggs jokes with William F. Tucker during a family birthday party in Hampton, Virginia. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nShe\u2019d only tell relatives parts of the story, never the whole thing. Thelma believed that the story was a book, and she was the only one to write it. She compiled a manuscript, which never got published because she wouldn\u2019t relinquish control.\n\nThen she died, at 64, in 2006.\n\nHer research went to her daughters and became caught up in a family rift over real estate, divorces and other issues.\n\nThelma\u2019s daughter, Shree Green, says her mother\u2019s research could shed light on the family tree. She says that she and her sister want to publish it, but they\u2019re not ready. The other Tuckers say they\u2019re mystified.\n\nThis June, Wanda stood by Thelma\u2019s simple horizontal headstone in the family cemetery. She lamented what the loss of the research meant to the family story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like she took it with her to her grave.\u2019\u2019\n\nWho lies below?\n\nThey couldn\u2019t afford a gravestone. So sometimes, to mark a burial spot, the slaves would plant a seed. And the seed would become a tree, and the tree would grow higher, 2 feet a year.\n\nThe place where Thelma was laid to rest is dotted with oaks and pines 50 feet high. It almost certainly dates to the time of slavery. It feels like the nave of a cathedral.\n\nThe Tucker family cemetery lies seven miles from where the first Africans landed in 1619, and a mile from the site of Capt. Tucker\u2019s plantation. It\u2019s incongruously surrounded by squat 1950s tract houses and almost invisible from the street.\n\nBy 1896, the year the Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson ratified \u201cseparate but equal,\u2019\u2019 Thomas Tucker and five other men paid $100 for what was known as the Old Colored Burial Ground. Tuckers probably were buried there before that, and they\u2019ve been buried there ever since.\n\nShow caption Hide caption The Tuckers are divided about whether this resting place should be sacred ground for the dead or a place where the family can find answers... The Tuckers are divided about whether this resting place should be sacred ground for the dead or a place where the family can find answers about their ancestors. Some hope to see it studied as an archeological site. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nBut after Thelma\u2019s death, the cemetery was neglected. Neighbors used it as a dumping ground \u2013 for a couch, a refrigerator, a water heater. Snakes crawled through the vines, and the vines crawled up the tree trunks. Kids used it to play jungle.\n\nThen, on May 17, 2013, the Tuckers picked up their local newspaper, The Daily Press, and saw this headline: \u201cHISTORIC CEMETERY DRAWS MAYOR'S EYE.\u2019\u2019\n\nCity officials said it had \u201clanguished for years under iffy ownership and infrequent maintenance.\u2019\u2019 The mayor said the graveyard apparently had been abandoned.\n\nThe story shocked and embarrassed Wanda, Walter and their relatives. They told the city the cemetery wasn\u2019t abandoned. It was theirs \u2013 they had the 1896 deed. They galvanized to form the William Tucker 1624 Society and began meeting regularly to clean and prune it.\n\nThe skull that Walter found, which was solemnly reburied in a small white coffin, was a sign the cemetery was more than it seemed. As the weeds and vines were cut back, the Tuckers found depressions that looked like unmarked graves. They hired a company to survey the graveyard with ground-penetrating radar.\n\nShow caption Hide caption The Tucker Family Cemetery has become a focal point for the family, as it was once in disrepair and overgrown. Now the William Tucker 1624... The Tucker Family Cemetery has become a focal point for the family, as it was once in disrepair and overgrown. Now the William Tucker 1624 Society works to maintain the property with regular clean ups. Marion Jones of Detroit and Daisey Taylor of Newport News help at one of the family's volunteer days. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nThe result amazed them. The cemetery contained more than 100 unmarked graves, as many as the number of marked ones. That\u2019s when it hit Walter: \u201cThis could be where our earliest ancestors are buried.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe discoveries spread the cemetery\u2019s fame and seemed to bolster the Tuckers\u2019 claim to history.\n\nThe Tucker 1624 Society received a $100,000 grant from an environmental nonprofit for cemetery work. The legislature approved an easement to protect the cemetery from development and ensure public access. Gov. Ralph Northam visited the cemetery last August to sign the legislation.\n\n\u201cCemeteries can be a way for us to retrace our history,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nNews reports often speculated \u2013 and sometimes stated as fact \u2013 that William actually was buried there. Northam himself referred to \u201cWilliam Tucker\u2019s presence here \u2026\u2019\u2019\n\nToday, the family is divided on whether to explore the cemetery\u2019s secrets. Walter and Wanda are willing to have graves opened and the remains exhumed to discover who was buried and when.\n\nWalter believes that since the cemetery was used by a relatively limited number of families, there might have been burials as infrequently as once every few years. If so, he reasons, its first burials might have occurred in the 1700s or even the 1600s \u2013 William\u2019s time.\n\nBut Tucker elders think the dead should be left in peace.\n\nFor now, Walter concedes, they have a veto. But some day, \u201cI\u2019ll be the elder.\u2019\u2019\n\nSlaves had a harrowing journey to America. We tell it in augmented reality. Explore\n\nA different kind of search\n\nThe Tuckers\u2019 claim demands more research, historians say. Austin, the Hampton museum historian, sums up the Tuckers' dilemma: \u201cWe just don\u2019t always have the information to tell the story we want to tell.\u2019\u2019\n\nTheir story faces a competing, if less-publicized, claim to a 1619 connection. A retired corporate executive named Shelton Tucker, also a Tidewater, Virginia, resident but not directly related to Wanda\u2019s family, also says he\u2019s descended from William.\n\nThere are tensions between these two Tucker clans \u2013 \u201ca Hatfields and McCoys kind of thing,\u2019\u2019 says a local historian, Calvin Pearson.\n\nShelton Tucker resents the public focus on the other Tuckers\u2019 claim. \u201cThe red carpet family,\u201d he calls them. \u201cWe\u2019re all Tuckers, but when the cameras show up, it\u2019s always them. They\u2019ll say anything to get in front of a camera.\u2019\u2019\n\nContinue the conversation Sign up here Get email updates about more stories like this\n\nUntil someone proves otherwise, the Tuckers continue to celebrate their status as the \u201cfirst family.\u201d They\u2019ve made the search a family affair.\n\nWalter\u2019s sister, Carolita Jones-Cope, 60, handles calls from the media, which have been pouring in.

Brandi Davis Melvin, 42, brings her three young daughters to the cemetery to spruce it up.\n\nBrenda Tucker Doswell, 77, speaks and sings at programs celebrating her family\u2019s story. She\u2019s picked out a long skirt made of African fabric to wear when she sings Friday at the cemetery. \u201cThis is 400 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we commemorate and celebrate.\u201d\n\nVerrandall Tucker personifies the family\u2019s pride in its story. He shows newspaper clippings to customers at his men\u2019s clothing shop. He\u2019s screened a video of a TV news report about the family\u2019s lineage at his church.\n\nSometimes he changes out of his dress clothes, closes his shop and leaves a sign: \u201cGone to cemetery.\u2019\u2019\n\nAn inconvenient truth\n\nWanda Tucker has taken on what may be the most challenging task \u2013 the search for historical validation.\n\nFor hours last month she turned the pages of a huge ledger, squinting in the fluorescent glare at the faded cursive script, puzzling over archaic spellings. At 61, she's a practiced researcher \u2013 Ph.D., professor, department chair. But this is the search of her life.\n\nHer family can trace its roots no further than the early 1800s; before that, the trail goes cold, leaving a 175-year gap in a genealogical chain to William.\n\nWhich is why she was poring through the 166-year-old Register of Birth at the courthouse in Isle of Wight County, Virginia.\n\nIn trying to prove one story about her family, however, she risked disproving others.\n\nEvery year Hampton residents, including Mayor Donnie Tuck in purple, gather at the \"Day of Remembrance\" to honor ancestors who were taken to America. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nThe link to William was only one story the Tuckers told about their history. They also believed that, in the long night of American slavery, they \u2013 unlike the vast majority of blacks \u2013 remained free.\n\nLast month she was searching for birth records for Thomas Tucker, her great-great grandfather, who she thought was born about five years before the Civil War. She wanted a specific date.\n\nThe records started in 1853, so she began there, scouring the ledger for a Thomas Tucker born to a woman named Millie. But there were none \u2013 not even any Thomases. So she started over, looking simply for a Tom born to a Millie.\n\nAnd suddenly, after two hours of searching, there he was on page 21 \u2013 born Oct. 20, 1856.\n\nHelp support quality journalism like this.

After the columns with newborns\u2019 names, birth dates and mothers\u2019 names, there were three other columns: White. Colored/free. Colored/slave.\n\nAnd Wanda saw that, despite all she\u2019d been told, the column checked was the last one. Slave.\n\nIf that story was not true, what about the most important one of all?\n\nShe\u2019s had time to think about that question, and she still believes William was her ancestor: \u201cUntil somebody proves me wrong, it is the story I am holding onto, and the one I am going to keep telling.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat's what makes the cemetery so important. Whether or not the Tuckers can ever prove a connection with William, it shows that they have endured slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, the Klan, Jim Crow and separate but equal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve survived,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u2019\u2019\n\nExplore more 1619 stories\n\nWere Wanda Tucker's ancestors America's first slaves?
