This is a business that did not need to fail.'\n\nJacobs, who also runs magazine business Jacobs Media Group, said Meysman \u2013 as well as former chief executives Fankhauser, Harriet Green and Manny Fontenla-Novoa \u2013 must take much of the blame for Thomas Cook's demise.\n\nHe added: 'My main thought is that in public companies you have a board [whose] role is to safeguard shareholders' interests and police the business. I believe that that has not happened.\n\n'The chairman and the non-execs need to be held accountable. They're the ones people scrutinise to find out how on earth this could happen.'\n\nJacobs said he tried to buy Thomas Cook in 2012 with backing from Woodford and his then-investment firm Invesco. But he said the deal was scuppered by Meysman.\n\nHays Travel, run by husband and wife team John and Irene, last week shocked the travel industry by agreeing to buy Thomas Cook's entire retail estate\n\nHays Travel, run by husband and wife team John and Irene, last week shocked the travel industry by agreeing to buy Thomas Cook's entire retail estate, saving up to 2,500 jobs, just weeks after the company's collapse.\n\nChief executive John, 70, and chair Irene, 65, believe they can make a success of running a large high street travel business, despite critics suggesting that Thomas Cook's retail arm was key to its downfall.\n\nBut John Hays hit back, saying: 'Thomas Cook had a near-death experience about eight years ago and it was on the brink of going bust then under the weight of its debt.\n\n'It had limped along since then under this debt burden. I think the term that's normally used is 'zombie company' because it had so much debt.\n\n'It was spending so much money servicing the debts that all of its profits got eaten up by interest charges. Once you get into that situation, you're at your overdraft limit, then you can't afford to keep investing in your business.\n\n'The latter directors have taken a lot of flak, but I think the problems started a long time ago.'\n\nA source close to Meysman said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that a private buyer of Thomas Cook would have been any more successful at saving the business. Thomas Cook's challenge has always been debt and its inability to fund a change in its business model.'", "description": "Thomas Cook did not need to fail and was turned into a 'zombie' firm by former bosses who overloaded it with debt, two influential travel executives have claimed.", "authors": ["William Turvill For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
