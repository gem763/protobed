The Dealmaster returns today to share a new batch of deals. Our top ten list spans a bunch of different categories, and it includes discounts on the original Nintendo Switch, the HP Spectre x360 13 convertible, Beats headphones, and much more.\n\nIf you've been itching for a Nintendo Switch, Newegg is offering the original model for $259.99. The biggest difference between this model and the newest version is battery life\u2014Nintendo improved the battery life for the new model so it will last up to nine hours when playing in handheld mode. The original model, in contrast, lasts up to six hours on a single charge.\n\nBut Nintendo doesn't sell this original model anymore, so this is a good opportunity to get the Switch for less than $299\u2014the standard price of the new model that doesn't often come down. (There's always a chance that we could see some Nintendo Switch savings around the holidays, but there's no guarantee.)\n\nOur favorite Windows convertible, the HP Spectre x360 13, is on sale for $899.99. This model includes a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB PCIe SSD. Not only is it one of the most attractive 2-in-1 ultrabooks you can get, but it also has a killer 30+ hour battery life.\n\nBest Buy has a good deal on Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones that brings the price down to $129. These headphones have been discounted recently, going from $179 to about $149, but rarely have they hit $129 in the past. While they work with all types of devices, the W1 chip in these headphones lets them pair quickly and easily with iPhones and iPads.\n\nIn addition to those deals, we also have a great deal on a 55-inch Samsung smart TV, discount codes for Anker and Aukey accessories, and a sale on the new and popular Untitled Goose Game for Nintendo Switch. Check out those plus the rest of the deals list below.\n\nNote: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop 10 deals of the day\n\nLaptop and desktop PC deals\n\nVideo game deals\n\nGaming deals\n\nTV and home entertainment deals\n\nElectronics deals\n\nAccessories deals", "description": "Plus deals on smart TVs, wireless chargers, video games, and more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dealmaster092619-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
