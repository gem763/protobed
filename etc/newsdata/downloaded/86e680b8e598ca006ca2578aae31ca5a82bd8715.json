Twice.\n\nWhen Brown was cut by the Oakland Raiders, who signed him to an extension with $30 million guaranteed in March, people said he ended up just fine because he got $15 million from the New England Patriots for one season, with $9 million guaranteed.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nFor the second time since the end of the preseason, Brown couldn\u2019t keep himself out of trouble long enough to collect a check most of us can only dream about. He asked for his release from the Raiders after posting a YouTube video of a phone call with Jon Gruden, and the Raiders granted that request. Hours later, the Patriots signed him.\n\nAnd a few days before $5 million of his signing bonus was due from the Patriots, they also moved on after new allegations became public. The Patriots might have to fight Brown over the payment of that signing bonus, but broad language in the contract probably favors the Patriots in that battle.\n\nAntonio Brown cut before he was due $5 million\n\nThe Patriots cut Brown on Friday. They didn\u2019t announce why he was cut, but it came after a civil lawsuit alleged Brown raped his former trainer, and then a story by Sports Illustrated\u2019s Robert Klemko said a second woman who accused Brown of sexual misconduct got intimidating texts from Brown this week that included photos of her children.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose were costly texts. Brown was due a $5 million portion of his signing bonus next Monday, according to NBC Sports Boston\u2019s Tom Curran. That was the first portion of his $9 million signing bonus. As Yahoo Sports\u2019 Charles Robinson wrote on Sept. 11, the Patriots had language in Brown\u2019s contract that allowed them to void all $9 million of the guaranteed money if he took any action \u201cundermining\u201d the public image of the club. You\u2019d have to assume that standard was met.\n\nAssuming Brown will never get what was supposed to be guaranteed money, ESPN\u2019s Field Yates broke down exactly how Brown lost a fortune with his misconduct.\n\nIf Antonio Brown does not wind up receiving his $9M signing bonus from the Patriots (the first $5M was due to be paid on Monday), he will go from a $30M guarantee in March to $9M guaranteed to just $158,333 made for 2019. \u2014 Field Yates (@FieldYates) September 20, 2019\n\nThe Patriots deserve every bit of criticism they get for signing Brown. But at least it probably won\u2019t cost them much money in addition to the terrible publicity.\n\nNike, Xenith dropped Brown this month too\n\nBrown has lost other money through his never-ending string of drama and serious accusations against him.\n\nThe helmet manufacturer Xenith quickly cut ties with Brown after news of the lawsuit broke. Nike dropped Brown this week as well.\n\nThere are many questions about Brown\u2019s future, from whether the NFL will put him on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list to whether Brown will land with his fourth team in 2019 (let\u2019s not forget Brown also was almost was traded to the Buffalo Bills before he nixed that by threatening to not report ... the Bills have to be quite thankful).\n\nNo matter what happens next, it seems doubtful Brown will ever make up the money he cost himself.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
