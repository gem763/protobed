He later canceled a series of campaign events.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has since relaunched his campaign and has emphasized gun control and sharply criticizing what he describes as President Donald Trump's racist rhetoric.\n\n\"We must take the fight directly to the source of this problem,\" O\u2019Rourke said of the president, as he returned to the campaign trail some two weeks after the shooting. \"I want to be the leader for this country that we need right now and we do not have ... I want to be the kind of leader for this country that El Paso has raised me and taught me to be.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was the first candidate to bring up O\u2019Rourke.\n\nWhile saying that recent efforts in gun control activism show promise for real change, Biden interrupted himself to say, \u201cThe way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful.\u201d\n\nBiden initially referred to the former congressman by his first time and then corrected himself.\n\n\u201cBeto\u2019s good,\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris of California praised O\u2019Rourke, saying \u201cGod love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy.\u201d\n\nAnd Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said, \u201cI so appreciate what the congressman\u2019s been doing.\u201d\n\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey also spoke emotionally about witnessing the aftermath of a shooting shortly after moving to Newark, New Jersey, a city he would eventually lead as mayor.\n\n\u201cI'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing,\u201d Booker said. \u201cBut this is\u2026 what I'm sorry about -- I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change.\u201d\n\nFor his part, O\u2019Rourke invoked both the El Paso massacre as well as another Texas shooting, in Odessa, Texas, where seven people were killed by a shooter who used an AK-47.\n\n\u201cThere weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time,\" O\u2019Rourke said. \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/democratic-debate-17-gty-jc-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
