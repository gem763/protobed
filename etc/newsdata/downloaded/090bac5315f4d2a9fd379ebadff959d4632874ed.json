Two hundred new jobs will be created initially, rising to 500 in the long term. The new car, to be called the Grenadier, was inspired by Land Rover\u2019s original Defender model, which was introduced in 1948 and remained in production for 67 years. Ultimately, the company hopes to build 25,000 cars at the plant every year.\n\nKey parts, including the body and chassis, will be built at a second factory in Portugal, where a similar number of jobs will be created, before being brought to Bridgend for assembly. BMW will supply the engines, and engineering assistance will be provided by another German company, MBTech. The Bridgend plant will be built on a greenfield site adjacent to the area currently occupied by Ford\u2019s engine factory, which is due to close in September last year, with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Funding towards the \u00a3600m project is being provided by the Welsh Government \u2013 although the company has not yet said how much.\n\nThe Chairman of Ineos, billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, said the decision to build the vehicle in the UK was a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing. The new model is likely to face significant competition, however. Last week at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Jaguar Land Rover launched a new version of the Defender, a modern car which has also been inspired by the original machine.", "description": "Pendragon's shares have tumbled after its plunged to loss in a 'challenging' first half.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/4.0.0/bbc_news_logo.png"}
