In a series of Instagram posts this week, Plein claims that Ferrari is threatening to sue him because he posted images of his sneakers on the hood of his own personal supercar. Ferrari says Plein\u2019s behavior \u201ctarnishes the reputation of Ferrari\u2019s brands and causes Ferrari further material damage.\u201d\n\nFerrari\u2019s letter to Plein also says he using Ferrari\u2019s trademarks for the \u201cpromotional purposes\u201d of increasing his own brand and products\u2019 visibility. Again, the cars pictured are Plein\u2019s own. Ferrari is essentially claiming that Plein is harnessing its iconic imagery to bolster his own brand and also denigrate Ferrari\u2019s.\n\nThe photo in question has not yet been deleted, as well as multiple others featuring the cars, even though Ferrari\u2019s lawyers said they\u2019d file a lawsuit within two days of the letter\u2019s receipt.\n\nPlein is calling the letter \u201cblackmail,\u201d and has asked his followers to send photos of his shoes on top of their luxury cars. He even made a slideshow of what his followers sent. Plein is positioning his fight as about more than just his shoe brand and the Italian carmaker. \u201cThis is a fight for our right to post on our private social media accounts whatever we decide (as long as it does not cause any harm to anybody),\u201d he writes on his caption.\n\nAs for the actual legal case, The Fashion Law reports that Ferrari could potentially build a sound argument. \u201cJust as in the US, the holder of a registered trademark in Italy has the right to prevent third parties from using identical or similar trademarks for identical or similar products or services,\u201d TFL writes. \u201cGiven the positioning of Plein\u2019s footwear in the photo \u2013 i.e., right next to the Ferrari logos, and with the coordinating colors in mind, consumers might be led to believe that the two brands are working in collaboration for Plein\u2019s footwear collection or are otherwise affiliated in some way, which would give rise to merited claims of trademark infringement.\u201d\n\nIn a comment to Bloomberg, Carmine Rotondaro, an independent legal adviser to Plein, called Ferrari\u2019s accusations \u201ctotally baseless.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Ferrari is following through with its plans to file the lawsuit, but we\u2019ve reached out to the company for comment and will update if we hear back.", "description": "Ferrari reportedly sent a letter to fashion designer Philipp Plein threatening to sue him over Instagram posts that depicted his brand of shoes on top of his personal Ferraris.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wdgMccrUm0_TrWNVcO4a-NZeBAA=/0x0:599x314/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18478101/Screen_Shot_2019_08_02_at_3.21.00_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
