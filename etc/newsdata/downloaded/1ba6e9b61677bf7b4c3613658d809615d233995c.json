Plastic pollution is a scourge that is ravaging the surface of our planet. Now, the polluting polymer is sinking down to the bottom of the ocean. The deepest part of the ocean is found in the Mariana Trench, located in the western Pacific Ocean, to the east of the Mariana Islands. It stretches down nearly 36,100 feet (11,000 metres) below the surface. One plastic bag was found 35,754 feet (10,898 metres) below the surface in this region, the deepest known piece of human-made pollution in the world. This single-use piece of plastic was found deeper than 33 Eiffel towers, laid tip to base, would reach. Whilst the plastic pollution is rapidly sinking, it is also spreading further into the middle of the oceans. A piece of plastic was found over 620 miles (1,000 km) from the nearest coast - that's further than the length of France. The Global Oceanographic Data Center (Godac) of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (Jamstec) launched for public use in March 2017. In this database, there is the data from 5,010 different dives. From all of these different dives, 3,425 man-made debris items were counted. More than 33 per cent of the debris was macro-plastic followed by metal (26 per cent), rubber (1.8 per cent), \ufb01shing gear (1.7 per cent), glass (1.4 per cent), cloth/paper/lumber (1.3 per cent), and 'other' anthropogenic items (35 per cent). It was also discovered that of all the waste found, 89 per cent of it was designed for single-use purposes. This is defined as plastic bags, bottles and packages. The deeper the study looked, the greater the amount of plastic they found. Of all man-made items found deeper than 20,000 feet (6,000 metres), the ratios increased to 52 per cent for macro-plastic and 92 per cent for single-use plastic. The direct damage this caused to the ecosystem and environment is clear to see as deep-sea organisms were observed in the 17 per cent of plastic debris images taken by the study.\n\n\n\n", "description": "To test whether sunlight could break down polystyrene, researchers from Massachusetts in the US placed five of the most commonly-used types in water and under a sun-simulating lamp.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/13/19539338-0-image-a-6_1570711768870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
