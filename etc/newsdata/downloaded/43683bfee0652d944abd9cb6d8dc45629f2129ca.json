No date has yet been given but the timing of the action raises fears it could hit Christmas deliveries.\n\nThe union claims the Royal Mail is not sticking to an agreement over plans to reduce the working week and guarantee job security.\n\nThe strike action was immediately backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who branded the Royal Mail a 'privatisation failure'.\n\nRoyal Mail workers have voted for strike action, potentially threatening Christmas deliveries\n\nMr Corbyn tweeted: 'Thousands of posties have voted yes in record numbers for strike action in defence of their jobs.\n\n'Royal Mail is a Tory-Lib Dem privatisation failure. Its sell off led to shareholders creaming profits off the top while running down the service. #WeRiseAgain'\n\nBut many customers were unsympathetic, tweeting that the company delivers too much junk mail and striking before Christmas would only risk hastening its demise.\n\nOne wrote: 'What, strike around Christmas time? This is ridiculous and it is gonna be chaos.'\n\nThe union said it was pleased with the large percentage of members who had voted for the move.\n\nTerry Pullinger, the CWU's deputy general secretary, said what was happening to the Royal Mail was a 'national disgrace', with an emphasis on profit.\n\n'We represent decent, hard working people who don't deserve what is happening to them and the service.\n\n'There is something seriously wrong with the way the Royal Mail is being run. When we make a deal we stick to it.'\n\nHe claimed up to 50,000 jobs were at risk in the Royal Mail, as well as in Parcelforce, under plans to separate it from the postal business.\n\nMany customers were unsympathetic, saying the action would cause 'chaos'\n\nA spokesman for Royal Mail plc said the company was 'very disappointed' over the planned industrial action.\n\nThe spokesman said: 'A ballot result for industrial action does not necessarily mean there will be industrial action. We are still in mediation with the CWU... we are committed to reaching a resolution.\n\n'We want to reach agreement. There are no grounds for industrial action. Industrial action - or the threat of it - is damaging for our business and undermines the trust of our customers.\n\n'Royal Mail wants to transform to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs as we post fewer letters and receive more parcels.'", "description": "The union's members today backed industrial action by 97% in a turnout of almost 76%.
