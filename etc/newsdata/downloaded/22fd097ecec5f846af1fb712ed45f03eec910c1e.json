NBC is under renewed scrutiny amid allegations made by Ronan Farrow in his new book, Catch and Kill, that the network paid hush money to cover up multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against former Today show host Matt Lauer. NBC fired Lauer in November of 2017 after Booke Nevils, a former producer at NBC, accused Lauer of rape. NBC has claimed that they were unaware of any accusations against Lauer until Nevils came forward, and that there were no settlements paid out, but Kelly poked a hole in that defense.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a legal sleight of hand,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cYou can get paid out as a sexual harassment victim in something other than a settlement. You can get what\u2019s called enhanced severance. That\u2019s the situation where the receptionist is suddenly getting a seven figure goodbye.\u201d\n\nAnd if NBC truly has nothing to hide, Kelly had a suggestion.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing that needs to happen now,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cis they need to release any and all Matt Lauer accusers from their confidentiality agreements. NBC says they have nothing to hide, great. Let\u2019s not hide anything.\u201d\n\nHaving been at Fox News during multiple sexual misconduct scandals, most notably Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly, Kelly believes there\u2019s only one way for NBC to handle Farrow\u2019s allegations going forward.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an outside investigation into this company. They investigated themselves, that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cFox News had an outside investigator. CBS News had an outside investigator. NPR. The NFL. This is how it\u2019s done. You get somebody on the outside who can be trusted.\u201d\n\nTucker Carlson Tonight airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on Fox News Channel.\n\nWatch MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes praise Ronan Farrow while taking a shot at NBC:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
