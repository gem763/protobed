Gox Activity\n\nBack then, BTC picked up in earnest, posting its first-ever four-digit price. Bitcoin price moved up from the $100 range, bouncing to above $1,030.\n\nThe Reddit thread that suggested the similarity looked purely at BTC charts to arrive at this conclusion. At this point, it is uncertain if the chart pattern would repeat.\n\nStill, the expectations for BTC see the leading coin sticking to a parabolic path, at least in the long term. A price of $1 million in 2020 may be quite an impossibility, but there are predictions this price could be reached in a decade or two.\n\nIt must be noted that the 2014 peak price unraveled again to levels around $200. The triggering event for the 2013 rally was the activity on Mt. Gox \u2013 the Japanese exchange which closed in late 2013 after experiencing the biggest hack in crypto history.\n\nBack then, the price growth happened with some evidence of bot activity. As of today, Mt. Gox is still yet to return some of the locked-up BTC to the victims of the breach.\n\nTrading Profile Has Evolved\n\nIn 2019, the trading profile of BTC is entirely different. Nearly 75% of trading is happening not in dollar terms, but against Tether (USDT). The price action is sometimes following closely the new issues of USDT, as well as the coin\u2019s overall trading activity. Bitcoin price is also dependent on multiple exchanges, and no single bot or concerted action can sway the price to $1 million. Rallies of thousands of dollars, however, are still possible.\n\nBTC is still seen as a wild card, with no predetermined price action. Still, John McAfee keeps up his crypto-friendly message.\n\nRumors of Bitcoin's death have been greatly exaggerated:) \u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) October 27, 2019\n\nBTC traded at $9,212.28 on Wednesday, moving away from last Saturday\u2019s peak above $10,000. Early BTC adopters saw $10,000 per coin as \u201cmoon\u201d level activity, and there is a realistic expectation BTC may repeat prices of above $15,000 or even $20,000 in the coming months.\n\nBut so far, BTC has failed to perform a \u201cHalloween rally\u201d, and may not achieve the $16,000 level envisioned as an end of October price. Now, the biggest rally hope for BTC is the halving coming in about 190 days, which will make the block rewards of brand-new coins even more scarce.\n\nWhat do you think about John McAfee\u2019s prediction?
