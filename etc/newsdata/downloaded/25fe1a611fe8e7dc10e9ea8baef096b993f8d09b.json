But after reading half a dozen different stories about it, it sure looks unconstitutional to me. And not in a \u201c5-4, depending upon what John Roberts had for breakfast\u201d way either.\n\nThe facts couldn\u2019t be simpler. Three UConn students were strolling through the parking lot of a university student apartment complex on the evening of October 11. To entertain themselves, two of them decided to play a spirited game of \u201clet\u2019s yell vulgar words for the fun of it,\u201d which is just the sort of consequence-free mirth one might reasonably expect to have on a modern college campus. Eventually they got around to the most taboo word in American culture and decided to shout that one too, unaware \u2014 or unconcerned, I should say \u2014 that residents of the complex could hear everything.\n\nIt was caught on video:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/naacpuconn/status/1182821535670648833\n\nAn uproar ensued and the police were notified. Result: Misdemeanor charges of \u201cridicule\u201d on the basis of race. Which, to my surprise, actually is a thing in Connecticut.\n\nThe arrests come amid outcry from students demanding that administrators address racism and promote inclusion on the university\u2019s main campus in Storrs, Conn. Shortly after the parking-lot video went viral, another student alleged that two fraternity members used a racial slur against her at a party, the university\u2019s NAACP chapter wrote in a letter published this week. On Monday afternoon, hundreds of students chanted, \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a word,\u201d during an on-campus march and rally, joining professors in calling for action, the Courant reported\u2026 \u201cI feel uncomfortable and scared on this campus at this point,\u201d Areon Mangan, a UConn student, told WTNH last week. \u201cWe want change. This is not fair to us. It\u2019s disrespectful and it\u2019s just not okay.\u201d\u2026 On Monday, UConn\u2019s NAACP chapter released a list of eight demands, which included updating the student code of conduct on racism and hate speech; protecting students who report such incidents; creating a mandatory course on diversity, racial discrimination and hate crimes; and hiring more black administrators, faculty, staff and police officers.\n\nThat background is essential to understanding why the two were charged, I think. There was a second (unrelated) incident involving someone allegedly saying the N-word, with tremendous pressure brought upon the university and local authorities to do something about it. UConn\u2019s president has already announced that the school will immediately begin the search for its next chief diversity officer. As for the cops, they went thumbing through their book of statutes searching for something they could use to prosecute the offenders and came up with this turd:\n\nAny person who, by his advertisement, ridicules or holds up to contempt any person or class of persons, on account of the creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality or race of such person or class of persons, shall be guilty of a class D misdemeanor.\n\nThere are select circumstances in which shouting the N-word might earn you some criminal jeopardy, or at least a stiffer sentence for an unrelated crime you\u2019ve committed. If you assault someone and use slurs while doing it, that\u2019s a hate crime; if you\u2019re convicted of the assault, the D.A. can ask for extra time to be added to your sentence to punish you for your hateful motive. In theory, you could also be charged for saying the N-word while confronting someone even if you haven\u2019t actually assaulted them. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s terrible but still technically viable \u201cfighting words\u201d exception to the First Amendment, words that are apt to cause an immediate breach of the peace can be criminalized and the offender charged for uttering them even if no breach of the peace results.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what we have here. The defendants weren\u2019t confronting anyone. It\u2019s unclear if they thought anyone could even hear their conversation. Connecticut\u2019s statute is a straight-up \u201chate speech\u201d law, in which the \u201ccrime\u201d is purely the offense given to others by the content of the defendants\u2019 speech. That sort of thing isn\u2019t supposed to exist (or at least isn\u2019t supposed to be enforceable) under the First Amendment).\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to assume that racial \u201cridicule\u201d is a subject of recent statutory interest, with Connecticut\u2019s modern leftist vanguard quietly adding a \u201chate speech\u201d law to the state\u2019s penal code in a show of ultra-wokeness. Not so. It turns out that Eugene Volokh wrote a piece for Reason last year about this very statute and its patent unconstitutionality. The law dates from 1917 and really was aimed at ending discrimination in \u201cadvertisements\u201d specifically, just as the language says. I would have guessed that Connecticut prosecutors long ago stopped using it, knowing that any charges would be tossed in light of the revolution in free-speech jurisprudence during the last half of the 20th century. Surely, I would have told you, the charges in this case are a simple matter of ass-covering by the local D.A. and PD, knowing that a court will inevitably dismiss the case. Then cops and prosecutors can shrug and say to angry demonstrators, \u201cDon\u2019t blame us, we tried.\u201d\n\nBut no, according to Volokh\u2019s research, people in Connecticut really do get charged with this crime. Not a ton \u2014 only one conviction or so a year, on average \u2014 but prosecutors are in fact using the statute as a type of \u201cfighting words\u201d prohibition. Volokh wondered why defense lawyers aren\u2019t challenging the statute aggressively on First Amendment grounds and guessed, plausibly, that it\u2019s being used mainly as a lesser offense in plea-bargain cases. If there\u2019s a confrontation and the defendant utters a slur, the prosecution may offer a guilty plea to \u201cracial ridicule\u201d as a compromise to the defense rather than try to take the assault case to court. Forced to choose between the risk of a stiff sentence if he loses at trial and the certainty of a lighter one if he cops a plea to an unconstitutional law, a defendant in Connecticut might prefer to opt for the latter and put the whole matter behind him.\n\nProbably not the two guys here, though. There was no confrontation and their speech, however offensive, is undeniably protected. They\u2019ll likely fight the law and win. Maybe UConn\u2019s administration is going to try to arrange a deal with them where they\u2019ll ask for the charges to be dismissed if the two agree to drop out and find a new school. If they refuse, then we\u2019ll run into the question of whether a public university can expel a student for uttering the N-word.
