Corley spent five years studying millionaires and gathered his insights in several books, including \u201cChange Your Habits, Change Your Life.\u201d\n\nCorley interviewed 233 Americans with at least $160,000 in annual gross income and $3.2 million in net assets \u2013 177 of whom were self-made millionaires \u2013 and 128 Americans with $35,000 or less in annual gross income and $5,000 or less in liquid assets.\n\nThrough these interviews, he was able to identify the daily behaviors and habits that contributed to or inhibited a person\u2019s success.\n\nThe habits that worked against building wealth included overspending, engaging in negative self-talk, maintaining toxic relationships, and unhealthy eating and drinking behaviors.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nHabits are daily, often unconscious, behaviors that either contribute to or inhibit our success.\n\nThomas C. Corley, a certified public accountant and certified financial planner, spent five years studying millionaires and gathered his insights in multiple books, including \u201cChange Your Habits, Change Your Life.\u201d\n\nCorley interviewed 233 people with at least $160,000 in annual gross income and $3.2 million in net assets, 177 of whom were self-made. He also interviewed 128 Americans with $35,000 or less in annual gross income and $5,000 or less in liquid assets.\n\nThrough these conversations and further analysis, he was able to identify two types of habits: those that helped people build wealth (\u201crich habits\u201c), and those that worked against them. The latter habits have the power to cause financial, emotional, and mental destruction in a person\u2019s life, he says. To achieve success, one must identify these habits and replace them.\n\n\u201cAdopting one rich habit has the effect of eliminating many poor habits. That\u2019s why the rich habits are so powerful. Each one you adopt is like a double or triple in baseball,\u201d he writes.\n\nBelow are seven habits that won\u2019t lead to wealth, according to Corley.\n\n1. Overspending\n\nYou simply can\u2019t get rich spending more money than you make, whether it\u2019s buying a car or house you can barely afford or racking up a credit-card bill.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of the poor in my study did not save and most accumulated debt to subsidize their standard of living,\u201d Corley wrote. True wealth comes from saving and investing a portion of what you earn, no matter the size of your salary.\n\n2. Reading only for entertainment, or not at all\n\nsource Vincent West/Reuters\n\nReading with intention is a top habit of millionaires.\n\nIn Corley\u2019s study, 92% of people with minimal assets did not read to learn. \u201cSuccess requires growth. That growth comes from reading and educating yourself on a daily basis,\u201d he writes.\n\n3. Toxic relationships\n\nsource Jason Cairnduff/Reuters\n\nIt\u2019s hard to sever ties with people who may be holding you back. But if you\u2019re serious about setting yourself up for a rich future, it has to be done, Corley says.\n\nHe found that only 4% of the low-income people he studied associated with \u201csuccess-minded\u201d people.\n\n\u201cYou are only going to succeed in life if you surround yourself with the right type of people,\u201d he writes. That is to say, people who are encouraging, positive, curious, and helpful.\n\n4. A single stream of income\n\nsource sanjeri/Getty Images\n\nMany of us rely on one job to make money, but that\u2019s not how future millionaires operate.\n\nSixty-five percent of the rich people in Corley\u2019s study had at least three different streams of income set up prior to making their first $1 million. This not only supercharges earning potential, it acts as a safety net against job loss.\n\n\u201cPoor people have one income stream. Their eggs are all in one basket,\u201d Corley writes.\n\n5. Engaging in negative self talk\n\nsource Dragana Gordic/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not smart or educated enough.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d \u201cLife is a struggle.\u201d\n\nThese are examples of negative self-talk, Corley writes. These internal conversations fill us with doubt and act as a directive for our actions.\n\n\u201cWhen you allow negativity to rule your thoughts, you are programming your brain for failure,\u201d he writes. \u201cYou\u2019ll have no chance in life at breaking out of your current financial or life circumstances. These negative thoughts will become beliefs that act like computer programs.\u201d\n\n6. Having no plan\n\nYou don\u2019t need resources beyond your own imagination and determination to make a plan for the future. The plan \u2013 what you want to accomplish and where you want to be in 10, 15, or 20 years \u2013 is the first step to achieving any type of success, especially financial success.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of the poor in my study had no life plan,\u201d Corley writes. \u201cWithout a blueprint, without long-term goals, we are like leaves on a fall day, floating in the air aimlessly.\u201d\n\n7. An unhealthy lifestyle\n\nsource Lucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits \u2013 like excessive drinking, unhealthy eating, and minimal exercise \u2013 don\u2019t lead to wealth, according to Corley.\n\n\u201cPoor health habits create detrimental luck,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis is a type of luck that is a byproduct of poor habits, poor behavior, and bad decision making.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Through his interviews, Thomas C.
