(Jean-Pierre Muller, AFP)\n\nThe world's most famous painting, the \"Mona Lisa\", is to be moved so her room in the Louvre can be spruced up, the Paris museum said on Friday.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's masterpiece will be carried less than \"100 paces\" to the adjoining Medici gallery during the night of July 16, the museum's director Jean-Luc Martinez told AFP.\n\nThe fragile 500-year-old painting is very rarely handled, and will remain protected by bulletproof glass in its temporary home.\n\nThe portrait of a Florentine noble will be returned to her spot in the States Room just before a blockbuster Leonardo exhibition opens at the world's biggest museum in October.\n\nThe Louvre holds the largest collection of the Italian artist's work.\n\nMartinez said the move was part of an immense rolling renovation of the museum, which is struggling to cope with more than 10 million visitors a year.\n\nTens of thousands of people each day pass through the room in which the painting is shown opposite Paolo Veronese's giant canvass, \"The Wedding Feast at Cana\".\n\nIt has been sealed inside protective wooden shuttering while the work goes on.\n\nBlockbuster Leonardo show\n\n\"The population of a town\" passes every day through the room, said Martinez, which hasn't been redecorated since the early 2000s.\n\nHe said the \"Mona Lisa\" will stay in its original place for the Leonardo show - which begins on October 24 - as hanging it with the polymath's other works would have caused such bottlenecks that visitor numbers would have to be limited.\n\n\"We could not deprive 15 000 people a day from seeing the 'Mona Lisa',\" the director insisted.\n\nThe painting, thought to have been begun in the first years of the 16th century, has been moved very rarely since it was first housed in the Louvre in 1804.\n\nIndeed it hasn't left its walls in 45 years, and curators are strongly opposed to it doing so again, citing its fragility.\n\nThe painting was done on a thin panel of poplar, which has buckled over time, revealing a thin slit.\n\nIt last travelled in 1974 to Russia and Japan, having crossed the Atlantic in 1964 to be shown in the United States despite the fierce protests of the Louvre's curators.\n\nThe lady's not for touring\n\nFrance's last culture minister, Francoise Nyssen, had hinted that it might tour during the refurbishment work.\n\nLocals in Lens, a former mining town in the north of France which houses an outpost of the Louvre, campaigned for the \"Mona Lisa\" to be exhibited there.\n\nFootball fans even unveiled a huge banner of her in the local team's colours as part of their charm offensive.\n\nHer hometown Florence has also pleaded for the painting to be shown there.\n\nBut the request was rejected. France may not have entirely forgotten that in 1911 an Italian carpenter stole the canvass while working at the Louvre, smuggling it out under his overalls.\n\nVincenzo Perugia wanted to bring her back to her homeland, thinking mistakenly that she had been looted by Napoleon, like so many other Italian masterworks in the Louvre's vast collection.\n\nThe painting resurfaced in Florence two years later.\n\nIn fact, Leonardo had taken the painting with him to France and finished it there in 1516, three years before his death.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The world's most famous painting, the \"Mona Lisa\", is to be moved so her room in the Louvre can be spruced up, the Paris museum says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8925/91739474957746c3a2849261ae822704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-28"}
