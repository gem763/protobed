Scientists are investigating the plant for use in toothpaste, pharmaceuticals and even erotic wares, she said.\n\nCrajiru vine, whose leaves are consumed as a tea and is also used as body paint, impresses agronomist and farmer Keila Malvezzi da Silva for its ability to increase iron absorption.\n\nAnd many chefs are fascinated by ora-pro-nobis, a member of the cactus family known as \u201cpoor people\u2019s meat\u201d for its 25% protein content and for having four times the Vitamin C of oranges.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The Amazon in Brazil is on fire \u2013 how bad is it?\n\n\u2022 The acai seller who got a record deal\n\n\u2022 A plan to preserve Peru\u2019s prized vicuna\n\n\u201cThese [indigenous] communities possess a profound knowledge of the forest \u2013 an understanding we haven\u2019t even dreamed of,\u201d said chef Alex Atala. A former punk-rocker, Atala is as renowned for his study of Brazil\u2019s indigenous ingredients as for restaurant D.O.M.\u2019s two Michelin stars.\n\nWhen I entered the S\u00e3o Paulo restaurant\u2019s dining room, I saw bare glass tables supported by tree stumps, decor ranging from tomes by French chef August Escoffier to Elvis albums, and guests sporting suits and T-shirts, pearls and tattoos. I got the distinct sense that nothing here was going to be ordinary.\n\nBut after consuming intriguing, yet accessible, locally inspired dishes such as flower \u201cceviche\u201d made with stingless bee honey and humped-backed Zebu beef, so tender it\u2019s served with a spoon, I was stopped dead in my tracks by dessert: there were ants on my plate. I closed my eyes and downed the first little creature. After the disquieting sensation of scratchy legs brushing my throat came a surprise in the form of a mouth-filling burst of citrus and ginger. My gastronomic journey to Brazil had begun with a bungee jump out of my comfort zone.\n\nBrazil is a vast, fecund land, with much of the most remote parts of its 8.5 million sq km known only to inhabitants of indigenous communities and quilombos, settlements created by former African slaves. Brazil is said to possess 20% of the Earth\u2019s species, which compels the food community to learn all it can.\n\nFor Catalan chef Ferran Adri\u00e0, considered one of the world\u2019s best and most pioneering chefs, the Amazon is \u201cthe last frontier of gastronomy\u201d.\n\nYet, this still-unlocked treasure chest \u2013 that is deeply embedded in rural Brazilian culture and is the economic support system of many villages \u2013 is being threatened by devastating forest fires, cattle ranching, mining, logging and other forms of human intrusion.\n\nThese indigenous communities possess a profound knowledge of the forest \u2013 an understanding we haven\u2019t even dreamed of\n\nSome worry that the proliferation of processed food is threatening indigenous cuisine. \u201cThe fast food movement broke into our way of feeding ourselves and we have to reverse that,\u201d said chef Irene Nunes, who runs the hillside Caminho das Gerais restaurant several hours from S\u00e3o Paulo, where she puts her own twist on rustic cuisine.\n\nIn an effort to save the country\u2019s endangered products and culinary skills before they vanish, Brazil\u2019s most prominent gastronomy professionals are taking action. Near the end of 2018, Georges Schnyder, head of Slow Food Brasil, proclaimed the Pledge in Defense of the Culinary Culture of Brasil. Akin to the 2004 Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen signed by 12 Nordic chefs, including world-renowned Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, it reaches far beyond cuisine to preserve this country\u2019s agrarian roots.\n\n\u201cCooking is not about having a recipe,\u201d Schnyder asserted. \u201cIt\u2019s culture, it\u2019s sustainability, and this \u2018manifesto\u2019 is designed to recognise family growers as the basis of the food chain, and assure that their children can remain in the fields.\u201d\n\nAs fires rage in the Amazon, the need to act is even more pressing. According to Atala, \u201cThere is a significant increase in deforested areas, and we must deal with this problem responsibly and not turn the issue into an ideological dispute.\u201d\n\nPreserving traditions\n\nIn support of the Pledge, many chefs are launching parallel careers as explorers, travelling deep into the country\u2019s hinterlands to find and help preserve indigenous plants and artisan products by using them in their restaurants \u2013 often elevating or transforming them \u2013 and which in turn supports local producers.\n\nIn S\u00e3o Paolo, there\u2019s a futuristic air to Michelin-starred Man\u00ed, where model-turned-chef Helena Rizzo transforms local ingredients like manioc (cassava) into such uniquely daring dishes that patrons wait willingly for hours to eat. Rizzo has said she feels it\u2019s crazy to think that 90% of the world\u2019s diet comes from only a handful of species such as corn, rice and wheat. \u201cIngredients like arrowroot and mangarito [a relative of the yam], are important not only as ingredients but as a part of culture and food biodiversity. We still can find and cook with them, but I don\u2019t know until when. We have already lost so many ingredients...\u201d\n\nMany of Brazil\u2019s food experts believe that manioc is the foundation of the country\u2019s cuisine. Its myriad monikers, such as mani, maniva, aipim, mandioca and macaxeira, and countless by-products, including tapioca, polvilhos (tapioca flour), tucup\u00ed (a yellow sauce) and tiquira (an alcoholic beverage), are a testament to its ubiquity. While not yet endangered, manioc is so crucial to Brazilian cuisine that the Pledge specifically cites it as \u201cthe iconic product of our ancestral and indigenous culture\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one ingredient that has always been present in all social classes,\u201d said Atala. \u201cWe peel it, grate it and press it to obtain a starch [that] we call tapioca. When fermented, the broth becomes tucup\u00ed, and the pulp is transformed into manioc flour. Its versatility is impressive.\u201d\n\nChef Tereza Paim\u2019s Salvador restaurant is another safe harbour for traditional foods. At Casa de Tereza, she uses hand-drawn dend\u00ea oil (palm oil), turning any left over from cooking into soap for customers and employees to use. She believes that this oil, brought to Brazil by the Portuguese from Africa during the slave trade, is an ingredient that must never be lost, as its distinctive scent of violets and wine-red colour is a hallmark of traditional Brazilian cuisine, particularly in Bahia state.\n\nShe calls it \u201cnumber one of my heart\u201d, and sees its reddish hue as \u201cpainting our food with the colour palette of sunset at All Saints Bay\u201d, the body of water fringing part of the city of Salvador, where food and culture imported during the slave era still thrive. According to Paim, local dend\u00ea oil \u201ctells us every day that we are Afro-descendants\u201d.\n\nA mixed heritage\n\nBrazilians are immensely proud of their multi-ethnic heritage. It\u2019s a country inhabited by people of widely diverse backgrounds, from Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, along with more than 200 indigenous populations who also come from vastly different regions ranging from the Amazon\u2019s rainforests to the savannas of the Cerrado to the watery Pantanal. All of their culinary wisdom has co-mingled to create a unique mother cuisine that modern Brazilian gastronomy advocates aim to honour, preserve and evolve for the future.\n\nJust as Brazil\u2019s population has come from all over the globe, so have many of its ingredients and cooking techniques. The seeds of guandu beans, for example, which improve the soil and add nitrogen to crops, are thought to have arrived hidden in the hair of slaves, said agronomist Malvezzi da Silva. And, according to Paim, the first \u201cBrazilian\u201d cooks were slaves in the kitchens of Portuguese nobility, who creatively adapted Portuguese, African and indigenous cuisines to available ingredients.\n\nIndeed, some foods became a secret language for these slaves, who created sanctified dishes for Candombl\u00e9, a religion with African roots. According to chef Bel Coelho, these preparations are considered so sacred that they can only be cooked by a yabasse, a woman who has dedicated her life to learning the highly specific preferences of each Orix\u00e1, or representative of the Candombl\u00e9 deity. The closest visitors may get to experiencing this fare is through tasting dinners at Coelho\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo restaurant Clandestino, where she has devised her own recipes inspired by yabasse cooks. The restaurant is open only for one week each month; dining is by reservation only; and the exact dates are chosen one month in advance.\n\nChef Telma Shiraishi of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Restaurant Aizom\u00ea, and now the Japanese Cuisine Goodwill Ambassador in Brazil, represents another populous group: immigrants from Japan. \u201cLike many others, my grandparents came to Brazil as land workers on the coffee plantations,\u201d she noted. \u201cFrom my point of view, this country is formed by the fusion of native cultures and those of the varied populations that arrived over the centuries, creating this mosaic.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven people who came in search of riches have left us immense treasures,\u201d said chef M\u00f4nica Rangel of restaurant Gosto com Gosto, 200km north-west of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nRangel believes that while they originally came to profit from Brazil\u2019s natural resources, these mostly European people enriched the land by making use of it \u2013 such as by raising cattle and starting small cheese factories \u2013 and added their own cultural flourishes to traditional Brazilian foods.\n\nThrough its cuisine, Brazil has managed to embrace many cultures and nations. \u201cIt\u2019s the kitchen of the tropeiro [drovers always on the move] but also of the court,\u201d said Rangel. \u201cAnd it is amidst these many historical flavours that the chef finds space to exercise fearless creativity.\u201d\n\nAdapting the past to preserve the future\n\nEven people who came in search of riches have left us immense treasures\n\nThese prescient chefs believe that employing creativity \u2013 rather than strictly preserving traditions \u2013 will help Brazil\u2019s culinary values endure. Indeed, their Pledge specifically defends \u201ca free, creative cuisine that is open to influences and individual expressions\u201d.\n\nAt Man\u00ed, Rizzo is inspired by indigenous peoples\u2019 practice of cooking fish on banana leaf, but substitutes leaf of elephant ear, a nonconventional edible plant in the same family as mangarito. And Shiraishi gives traditional Japanese pickles a Brazilian spin using maxixe, a cucumber brought from Africa during the slave trade, and substituting cacha\u00e7a (a distilled spirit made from sugarcane) for sake.\n\nSome chefs are transforming indigenous ingredients into otherworldly dishes rarely seen on high-end degustation menus. Coelho, for instance, recreates acaraj\u00e9, a black-eyed pea and bean dumpling traditionally made for Ians\u00e3, the goddess of wind and lightning, using the same ingredients of dend\u00ea oil, coconut milk, coriander, chilli and peanuts, but with molecular gastronomy techniques. For her version, Coelho makes a very thin black-eyed pea soup, then adds alginate and calcic, a calcium salt, to create a \u201cliquid sphere\u201d.\n\nPaim addresses modern health concerns with her Shrimp Bobo dish, using manioc and dend\u00ea oil to create a creamy stew that is both gluten and lactose free.\n\nGenerally speaking, these Brazilian chefs believe their efforts to preserve and evolve culinary products and practices can have an impact far beyond their restaurant kitchens. And as such, several chefs are laying plans for the future in support of local communities and their ingredients.\n\nChef Ana Bueno of Banana da Terra in Paraty, for example, has established the School of Eating in Paraty to improve the nutrition of schoolchildren and educate them about healthy eating and local agriculture.\n\nPreserving and sharing the food wisdom of our ancestors can offer solutions to some of the most pressing sustainability challenges we face today\n\nAnd Rangel organised the Pinh\u00e3o Festival to celebrate the nut of the endangered Arauc\u00e1ria tree. Over the last 26 years, the fete has grown from a one-woman enterprise at Rangel\u2019s restaurant into a nationally known event that involves 42 restaurants, draws celebrity chefs and has helped transform Brazil\u2019s Visconde de Mau\u00e1district in the countryside of Rio de Janeiro state into a thriving tourism centre.\n\n\u201cPreserving and sharing the food wisdom of our ancestors can offer solutions to some of the most pressing sustainability challenges we face today,\u201d said chef Manu Buffara, a farmer\u2019s daughter who now runs Restaurant Manu in her native town of Curitiba. \u201cMuch of what is lost is forgotten,\u201d she warned, so we must continually revisit our culture and our roots.\n\nYet, even as they respect their country\u2019s culinary roots, Brazil\u2019s chefs thrive on innovation. Inspired to use ancient ingredients in new ways they are galvanising one another, sending a wave of madly inventive cuisine across the country.\n\nThere\u2019s poetry in the way Brazilians speak of food, lifting this basic human need to a far higher plane. In the words of Malvezzi da Silva: \u201cFood is the bond of the human being with nature, through which we are regaining consciousness of who we are and where we should go.\u201d\n\nAncient Eats is a BBC Travel series that puts trendy foods back into their \u2018authentic\u2019 context, exploring the cultures and traditions where they were born.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
