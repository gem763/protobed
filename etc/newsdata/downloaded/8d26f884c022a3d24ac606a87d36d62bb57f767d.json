Bernie Sanders (I-VT) visited Rep. Rashida Tlaib\u2019s (D-MI) Detroit district over the weekend and used the opportunity to campaign in front of empty pantry shelves, creating an awkward situation for the socialist senator, as depictions of empty store shelves tend to be associated with the reality of the progressive ideology he routinely touts.\n\nThe far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member officially endorsed Sanders over the weekend during his stop in her Detroit district, endearingly referring to him as \u201cAmo Bernie,\u201d which means \u201cuncle\u201d in Arabic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m endorsing Amo Bernie Sanders because he understands that it\u2019s not just about policies and words but it\u2019s going to be also about completely transforming the structures in place that is hurting American people,\u201d Tlaib stated, adding that Sanders is \u201cnot going to sell us out.\u201d\n\nAt one point during Sanders\u2019 tour of the district, the presidential hopeful delivered remarks at the Brightmoor Food Pantry in Detroit, which is reportedly running out of bottled water due to families flocking to the pantry. The city has turned off the water for an increasing number of Detroit families due to their inability to pay the bills, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\n\u201cHere in this campaign, we hear the word socialism a lot. Well, what this is a perfect example of is socialism for billionaires, massive amounts of subsidies and tax breaks,\u201d Sanders said, allowing the empty shelves to serve as his backdrop.\n\n\u201cBut for children, there\u2019s not enough money for a decent education and for poor people, there\u2019s not an ability to get clean drinking water,\u201d he added.\n\nSome on social media could not help but point to the irony, as empty shelves have become a hallmark of socialism, demonstrating the harsh realities of the ideology Sanders openly embraces:\n\nWhich social media genius decided to film Bernie Sanders \u2013the presidential candidate people accuse of being a socialist \u2014 in front of empty grocery shelvespic.twitter.com/hpPRh7irRU \u2014 Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) October 28, 2019\n\nAre the empty shelves in the background supposed to be an advertisement for Socialism? pic.twitter.com/D74Fl6NYbv \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 29, 2019\n\nAnyone notice the backdrop behind @BernieSanders and @RashidaTlaib looked like the empty shelves of grocery stores in many socialist countries?
