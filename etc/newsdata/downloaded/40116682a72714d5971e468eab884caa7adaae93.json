Wild said Canada\u2019s market is having retail issues, which include delays in the opening of retail shops.\n\nHarder Than Anticipated\n\nComplying with Canadian regulations has also been harder than anticipated, he said. \u201cBut U.S. operators, many of them are growing really well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 420 Investor Alan Brochstein echoed these sentiments during a recent appearance on Benzinga's PreMarket Prep trading show.\n\n\u201cCanada\u2019s rollout of legalization has been hampered by a number of things,\u201d Brochstein said. \u201c...They should have opened up medical dispensaries first and gotten that distribution out there,\u201d Brochstein said. \u201cInstead they waited until it was fully legal, and then each province did it differently. So you have a situation right now where there just aren\u2019t enough retail stores.\u201d\n\nShares of Canadian cannabis stocks such as Aurora Cannabis Inc (NYSE: ACB)(TSE:ACB) and Tilray Inc (NASDAQ: TLRY) have dropped more than 70% over the last year.\n\nRelated Links:\n\n4 Pro Cannabis Investors Talk Stocks\n\nCresco Labs CEO: The Future Of Cannabis Legalization Includes Social Equity\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
