Now those concerns have extended to Apple Pay, with EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager\u2019s office probing whether the company\u2019s pre-installed mobile payments software is playing dirty with the competition, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\nEuropean Commission officials asked mobile-payments providers, banks and app developers in September \u201cabout how Apple Inc. devices may favour Apple Pay over other payment solutions,\u201d Bloomberg wrote, citing MLex. In an email statement to Bloomberg, regulators confirmed the office was monitoring \u201cpossible anti-competitive market practices and abusive conduct\u201d without naming Apple.\n\n\u201cIn this context, the commission is actively monitoring the development of mobile payment solutions, the behaviour by operators active in the payments sector, including mobile payments,\u201d the EU wrote.\n\nAccording to MLex, the issue centres on Apple\u2019s proprietary Near-Field Communication (NFC) chip, which Apple Pay relies on to enable users to pay at stores by just holding their phones near a card reader. Last year, Vestager said she was aware of reports that Apple was limiting use of the NFC chip to only cards included in Apple Wallet. No such restrictions on NFC permissions for cards or banking apps exist on Android.\n\nCompetitors have also complained that Apple refuses to allow competing payment methods into Apple Wallet, as well as the way that the iPhone automatically prompts users with Wallet and Apple Pay interfaces when an NFC signal is received, MLex reported. According to 9to5Mac, while Apple has eased up on some NFC restrictions, other apps have to be manually opened to the foreground to receive NFC signals.\n\nNo official investigation is yet underway, and EU regulators could decide to drop the matter. But services like mobile payments have become a cornerstone of Apple\u2019s strategy in an era of declining device sales, with CEO Tim Cook recently saying that Apple Pay\u2019s growth is adding users and growing monthly transaction volumes faster than PayPal.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University Tepper School of Business\u2019s Tim Derdenger recently told Quartz that Apple is obviously restricting the feature for its own benefit, because \u201cThey don\u2019t want rivals launching a wallet. If they opened it up, it would mitigate their market position.\u201d", "description": "Officials across the European Union have already made their thoughts on Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency project clear.
