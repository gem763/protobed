With more than three years left on his contract, the midfielder is unlikely to come cheap and will probably cost north of \u00a370m if Chelsea are to even bother entertaining the notion of letting him go.\n\nMo Salah earns jittery Liverpool 4-3 win after RB Salzburg storm back Read more\n\nManchester United, eh? Eager to close the stable door long after the horse has bolted towards the horizon with Romelu Lukaku on its back, the club hierarchy are hoping to bolster their fairly toothless attack in January. Somebody in their recruitment department has thrown three darts at a wall covered in Panini stickers and hit those bearing the mugshots of the RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner, Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and his Barcelona namesake Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (no relation). Also ready to bid for the Juventus outcast Mario Mandzukic, it\u2019s almost as if United realised their summer transfer policy was a mite ill-conceived, although their January one doesn\u2019t seem any more coherent.\n\nUnited are also interested in bringing the Leicester playmaker James Maddison and Real Sociedad (on loan from Real Madrid) midfielder Martin \u00d8degaard to Old Trafford, in a state of affairs that suggests the club hierarchy are seriously deluded if they think the current shambles they\u2019re presiding over is likely to be a more attractive option than the many other clubs who are bound to be clamouring for the services of both players. Newcastle\u2019s Sean Longstaff seems a far more realistic target, as the club he currently represents is of a few Premier League outfits that is run even more haphazardly than the one giving him the glad eye.\n\nNobody really thinks Tottenham would be dumb enough to sack Mauricio Pochettino after a poor run stretching back only two months, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the newspapers from reassuring us they aren\u2019t about to hand him his P45. Whether or not the Argentinian actually wants to stay at White Hart Lane is another matter altogether and \u2013 oh look, would you believe it? \u2013 Manchester United are believed to be monitoring his situation. With Pochettino\u2019s days at Spurs looking more numbered than a set of balls in a lottery tombola, the club\u2019s fans are worried Harry Kane will join the stampede of senior players who follow him out the door whenever he decides to leave.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAnd finally, the Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos is attracting admiring glances from the other side of the Atlantic, where MLS club LA Galaxy are interested in signing the prolific 23-year-old. With no red cards and 13 goals in 17 appearances this season, the hot-headed Colombian has been recalled to his national team\u2019s squad for matches against Algeria and Chile in this month\u2019s international break.", "description": "Timo Werner to Man Utd? | Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to Man Utd? | Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to Man Utd? | Sean Longstaff to etc, and so on?", "authors": ["Barry Glendenning"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b335c6948c98cf6a971762d5175c2f9a463364a/0_97_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c458d3d2508c6ff5a7169ad928d90202"}
