Her mates are glad she\u2019s letting loose and there\u2019s nothing but good feelings towards her. She\u2019s got a new lease of life.\"\n\nThat's not the only change she's made though.\n\nHaving defiantly refused to lose weight for anyone other than herself, the inspirational 31 year old first started improving her diet after the birth of her son Angelo in 2012.\n\n(Image: Hulton Archive)\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nFor the sake of her voice, she ditched the 10 cups of sugary tea she used to drink each day and waved goodbye to alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine all \"spicy, citrusy, and tangy\" foods.\n\n\"It's f***ing boring, but I don't think you take your voice seriously until you've an accident,\" she told Australia's 60 Minutes of her 2011 vocal hemorrhage.\n\n\"I'm frightened all the time I'm going to damage my voice,\" she admitted.\n\nIn 2016 she shed yet more weight ahead of her tour in a bid to \"get some stamina\".\n\n\"Now I fit into normal, off-the-shelf clothes, which is a really big problem for me,\" she proudly told Vogue.\n\nBy 2017 she was believed to have lost more than two stone, reportedly due to The Sirtfood Diet, which sees slimmers fill up on plant-based foods like kale, buckwheat, green tea and tumeric.\n\nThe foods are known as sirtuin activators, and are said to control the way the body processes fat and sugar and regulate the appetite in the process.\n\nGreen tea and cocoa powder are also on the menu, along with red wine and cheese.\n\n\"The Sirtfood Diet is all about losing weight and feeling fantastic through eating great-tasting food,\" a source told the Daily Mail.\n\n(Image: Adele/Twitter)\n\n(Image: Collect Unknown)\n\n\"It's based on extensive research into the power of key plant foods, which when added to our diet turn on fat burning and improve wellbeing.\"\n\nBut despite Adele's dedication, she has refreshingly admitted that she will never, ever, relish going to the gym.\n\n\u201cI mainly moan. I\u2019m not, like, skipping to the f-cking gym. I don\u2019t enjoy it,\" she told Rolling Stone in 2016.\n\n\"I do like doing weights. I don\u2019t like looking in the mirror. Blood vessels burst on my face really easily, so I\u2019m so conscious when I\u2019m lifting weights not to let them burst in my face. And if I don\u2019t tour, you\u2019ll catch me back down at the Chinese!\u201d", "description": "Adele showed off her stunning figure at Drake's party this week after months of hard work, and here's how she did it...", "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Image", "Corbis Via Getty Images", "Hulton Archive", "Wireimage", "Adele Twitter", "Collect Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article2713191.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Adele.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
