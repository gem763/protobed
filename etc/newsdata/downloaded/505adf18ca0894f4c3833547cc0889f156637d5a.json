On Monday night it wandered into a family home in the Sierra Nevada foothills, about 50 miles outside of Yosemite National Park.\n\nThe mountain lion banged through the front screen door of the home in Sonora, breezing past both the home\u2019s residents before fully comprehending what it had done, said Andrea Benson, a sergeant with the Tuolumne County Sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nThe lion ran deeper into the house once it spotted the residents, ending up in a bathroom, and the residents quickly shut the door behind it, Benson said.\n\nThey went into the basement and called for help, while the mountain lion appeared to take the opportunity to knock around toiletries. The sheriff\u2019s department and the state department of fish and wildlife responded, using a ladder to get a peek \u2013 and a photo \u2013 of the mountain lion in the second-story bathroom.\n\nWith the residents\u2019 permission, the sheriff\u2019s deputies broke the window and worked with the wildlife department to coax the animal out.\n\n\u201cThe officers were pounding on the wall to get his attention, and shining the light on the window area to show that there was a path to escape,\u201d Benson said. \u201cHe finally was able to jump out the window.\u201d\n\nThe mountain lion took off into the wilderness after making its escape from the bathroom, said Patrick Foy, a captain with the wildlife service\u2019s law enforcement division. \u201cHe did get a stern warning about the break-in before being released,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office wrote on Facebook.\n\nMore than half of California is mountain lion habitat, and Sonora is in the heart of mountain lion country, Foy said. However, human and mountain lion interactions are rare.\n\n\u201cMost lions stay away from people,\u201d Foy said. \u201cThe lions, they\u2019re always looking for food, but not in someone\u2019s house. There\u2019s just no way to surmise why the lion actually ran into the person\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nFoy can recall just two other times in his more than two decades of experience of mountain lions running into homes. In 2017, a mountain lion snuck into a home in the hills of San Mateo county, just south of San Francisco, and snatched a dog off a sleeping woman\u2019s bed. A few months later, a mountain lion crashed through an apartment window and on to a woman\u2019s bed in Colusa, north of Sacramento.\n\nThough mountain lions are always looking for prey, they rarely harm humans. The last mountain lion fatality in California was in 2004.", "description": "The big cat wandered into the home in the Sierra Nevada foothills and took refuge in the bathroom before being coaxed out", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d43c8682fad215b587305e099109e8ae41a4f9aa/0_91_1919_1151/master/1919.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75985c349e4547b43029d523493ad07f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
