That meant being on the ice with Allard at 6:30 a.m., four times a week starting in July.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get back to being myself,\u201d Neal told Canadian Press before Edmonton\u2019s 1-0 shootout loss to the Winnipeg Jets over the weekend. \u201cI wanted to skate like I know I could skate. I wanted to be able to shoot the puck like I know I could shoot the puck. Just all the things that I felt like I lost throughout the year in Calgary that I wanted to get back.\u201d\n\nThe extra work has paid dividends for the 32-year-old Canadian - and the Oilers.\n\nAfter putting up only seven goals and 12 assists in 63 games with the Flames - far off his run of 20-plus goals in 10 straight NHL seasons - Neal has already surpassed that. Through Sunday, he was tied with Boston\u2019s David Pastrnak for most goals in the league with nine goals in nine games.\n\nNeal set a franchise record for most goals (seven) through the first four games of the season, breaking a mark held by Glenn Anderson and Wayne Gretzky. Four of the goals came against the Islanders in a 5-2 win earlier this month.\n\nNeal\u2019s hot start has helped the Oilers get off to a 7-1-1 start, good for first in the Pacific Division. It\u2019s a welcome change for a team that has missed the playoffs 12 of the past 13 seasons.\n\n\u201cIt feels good. It pays off,\u201d Neal said of his extra training. \u201cYou want to get your confidence back. You want to get your swagger back. You want to get that good feeling back that you know you could be one of the best players.\u201d\n\nThe Flames signed Neal in July 2018, giving him a five-year, $28.7 million contract. He was coming off two trips to the Stanley Cup Final, but things didn\u2019t work out in Calgary.\n\n\u201cThey were paying me a lot of money to come in and score goals and be a big part of that team,\u201d said Neal. \u201cI came in and played in a third- and fourth-line role. For whatever reason, things just didn\u2019t work out so it\u2019s not really one thing or another. You can blame it on whomever you want or say whatever you want, but for me I could have been better. I think it just could have been different.\u201d\n\nNew Oilers coach Dave Tippett was Neal\u2019s coach a decade ago in Dallas. He recalled meeting with Neal before the season.\n\n\u201cHe was looking forward to the change and excited to come to a team where he was going to get more opportunity than he got last year and excited to see what he could do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, obviously, he\u2019s jumped in and he\u2019s played very well for us.\u201d\n\nNeal is on a line with center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Alex Chiasson. He\u2019s also skating on the top power-play unit with Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. Six of his goals have come with the man advantage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really battled around the net to get good opportunities to put pucks in,\u201d Nugent-Hopkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to see a guy like that, when you hear all the talk about the season last year and whatnot, come back and already have this good of a start. It\u2019s definitely cool to see.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "James Neal didn't feel like himself last season and knew he had to do something about it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/oilers_red_wings_hockey_43693_c0-175-4200-2625_s1200x700.jpg?0c2ff189453be42a2a9ce3107a20b9190ecec9bb", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
