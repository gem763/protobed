After the game was done, I turned on my Xbox to play \"NBA 2K20\" so I could replay the same matchup in the WNBA Finals myself.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, this wasn't possible two months ago. This is the very first year that the WNBA has been included in \"NBA 2K,\" and it has already done a great job helping me and countless others become more familiar with the league's players.\n\nPlaying games like \"Madden\" and \"MVP Baseball\" as a kid helped make me into a sports fan, and I know I'm not alone. The presence of the WNBA and other women's sports teams will help open these games up to new audiences and help bring new fans to professional women's sports.", "description": "The world's most popular basketball simulator has included the WNBA for the very first time, and it's a great moment for everyone involved.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0d2e7cc4a0a0d0432b627?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
