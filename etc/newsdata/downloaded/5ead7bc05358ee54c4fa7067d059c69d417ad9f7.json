It includes Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur as captain, Kim Shin-wook of Shanghai Greenland Shenhua and Lee Kang-in of Valencia CF.\n\nThe only new face is Lee Jae-ik of Al-Rayyan SC in the Qatari league. The 20-year-old defender was one of the stars in Korea's U-20 team, which finished as the runner-up in this year's FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland. He moved to the Qatari club from Gangwon FC in July after the World Cup.\n\nUncertainty hangs over the much talked-about Pyongyang match, the first inter-Korean match on North Korean soil in almost three decades after they faced off in an inaugural Dynasty Cup match in October 1990.\n\nThe two Koreas were also drawn in the same group for the third and final Asian qualifying rounds of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, but North Korea declined to host a match in its capital city. The venue was eventually moved to Shanghai, China, both times.\n\nThe Unification Ministry here said Monday that the North has informed the South that it will prepare for the match in accordance with international practices.\n\nThe ministry is also trying to discuss with the North sending a cheering squad to Pyongyang for the match.", "description": "National Team Roster for World Cup Qualifier in Pyongyang Announced", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/01/2019100100950_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
