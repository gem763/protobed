(Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press)\n\nLawyers for the federal government argued that the \"foreseeable death\" criterion is necessary to protect \"vulnerable\" people who are suffering from serious ailments but are not fatally ill from using the law as a way to die by suicide.\n\nThe judge rejected that comparison.\n\n\"What the plaintiffs are really looking for is that the law recognizes equally the suffering, the dignity and, ultimately, the autonomy of people who, like them, are affected by serious and irremediable health problems, without any hierarchy, whether death is near or not,\" Baudouin said.\n\nProvince to study decision\n\nHer decision gives governments six months to come up with something new before suspending that provision of the law.\n\nIt also grants an exemption to Gladu and Truchon that allows them to apply for medically assisted death immediately.\n\nGladu, left, and Jean Truchon launched their challenge with the help of lawyer M\u00e9nard. (Charles Contant/CBC)\n\nThe federal and provincial governments could appeal the decision.\n\nTruchon and Gladu's lawyer, Jean-Pierre M\u00e9nard, said his clients would hold a news conference Thursday.\n\nMany others reacted to the decision today.\n\n'Relieved, grateful and thankful'\n\nHeather Ross's husband Bob Blackwood received medical assistance in dying in 2017 in the Eastern Townships.\n\nShe was thrilled by the decision.\n\nBlackwood had Parkinson's disease. He was initially refused medical assistance in dying, because the first doctors he consulted didn't consider his death reasonably foreseeable.\n\nRoss said the delay between the initial refusal and the eventual acceptance was \"devastating.\"\n\n\"I'm very relieved and grateful and thankful. My husband would be too,\" Ross told CBC Wednesday.\n\n\"He would just be so happy that other people didn't have to suffer the way he did. And had that law been changed when he was going through this, he would've had a much easier time.\"\n\n'Better to be dead than disabled'\n\nGroups representing people with disabilities condemned the decision and encouraged the provincial and federal governments to appeal.\n\n\"Basically this decision is saying that as far as society's concerned, it's better to be dead than disabled,\" Amy Hasbrouck, with the group Not Dead Yet, told CBC Wednesday.\n\nHasbrouck said rather than making medically assisted dying easier to access, governments should be working to improve services for people with severe disabilities, so they can have a good quality of life and continue to live in their own homes.\n\nMichel Racicot is the lawyer for two groups that intervened in the case, Living With Dignity and The Collective of Doctors Against Euthanasia.\n\n\"On the one hand, governments are trying to prevent suicide with prevention campaigns. But now the message will be that if you are suffering, we will offer you a way out,\" Racicot said Wednesday.\n\nHe said people who receive a diagnosis of a serious disease may need time to accept their condition.\n\nHe's concerned that removing the \"reasonably foreseeable\" provision of the law would make it easier for such people to end their lives impulsively without having time to reflect.\n\nPoliticians react\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the National Assembly in Quebec City Wednesday, V\u00e9ronique Hivon, the PQ MNA and former cabinet minister who was the chief architect of Quebec's law, hailed the decision as an opportunity to improve it.\n\n\"I'm extending a hand to the health minister for us to work together on the next steps, so Quebec can continue to be a leader in the name of respect and dignity for people who are sick and suffering,\" Hivon said.\n\nQuebec's Health Minister Danielle McCann told reporters Wednesday her government would take time to study the decision.\n\nA spokesperson for the federal Ministry of Justice said the same thing.\n\nPremier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said Wednesday his government is open to making changes.\n\nProvincial Liberal health critic Andr\u00e9 Fortin called the decision \"good news.\"\n\nHe urged the government not to file an appeal and to act quickly to change the law.", "description": "A Quebec Superior Court justice has accepted the arguments of two Montrealers who argued access to medically assisted dying was too restrictive.
