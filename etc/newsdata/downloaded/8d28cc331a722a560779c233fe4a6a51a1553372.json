They have been aggravated and created by the structures we\u2019ve wrongly come to think of not just as irreplaceable but as intrinsic to the survival of the world: capitalism, colonialism, the patriarchy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But it doesn\u2019t always feel like this is the approach that some parts of XR take when it comes to the action pursued. In fact, it seems to be the total opposite.\n\nI\u2019m not the first person to point this out. Black, brown and indigenous groups around the world have been stressing the roots of these problems for decades. In Britain, groups like Wretched of The Earth and Black Lives Matter UK, have raised similar points.\n\nWretched of The Earth has stressed the importance of reflecting \u201cthe complex realities of everyone\u2019s lives\u201d in responses to the crisis. That includes an open letter to XR \u2013 in May this year \u2013 which challenged the activists to tackle head on the ways in which \u201csocial, economic and political systems shape our lives \u2013 offering some an easy pass in life and making others pay the cost\u201d.\n\nThese groups have protested \u2013 albeit to less fanfare \u2013 with the fullness of the problem of climate change years before XR came on the scene. They have called for an overhaul of approaches to migration and the financial sector, and tangible support for people in the global south who are being \u2013 and will be \u2013 hit harder than any other region due to environmental degradation.\n\nXR itself, has in part acknowledged the issue, albeit after several missteps. In spring, it released an online prison guide for protesters (which has since been deleted), suggesting that protesters of colour who found themselves in prison could comfort themselves with the falsehood that \u201cmost prison officers are black and do not wish to give you a hard time\u201d. The group has since apologised for the wording in the document. But it doesn\u2019t seem to have learned from it just yet.\n\nLast week, on release from police detention in Brixton, an Extinction Rebellion protester took it upon themselves to send flowers and a thank you note \u201cTo all the kind souls at Brixton police station, for all you have done with decency and professionalism.\u201d It was a move rightfully met with suspicion and concern considering the station\u2019s part in Britain\u2019s ugly history with deaths of black people in police custody, in this case, Sean Rigg.\n\nIn July, XR London also advised the police to \u201cconcentrate on issues such as knife crime, and not non-violent protesters who are trying to save our planet\u201d, yet another misstep seen as a call to push police to focus attention on the \u201creal\u201d sources of harm \u2013 seemingly the black community.\n\nThat, paired with pushing Rupert Read to the forefront of the movement hasn\u2019t helped to quash the impression that XR has several glaring blind spots when it comes to activism.\n\nRead, who appeared on Question Time last week, has been taken to task for suggesting that the \u201cnet environmental footprint\u201d is increased by migrants and that harsher immigration controls are central to fighting climate change. It\u2019s an idea echoed in dog-whistle arguments about overpopulation in the global south, placing the ultimate blame on those who have been most disenfranchised by the structures that have fuelled climate change in the first place. And it relies on the over-simplified logic that the real reason we\u2019re facing a crisis of this scale is that all those poor black and brown people are just \u201chaving too many babies\u201d.\n\nAnd then we come to class. While XR recognises that \u201cfor our movement to be safe for everyone, it needs to be safe for the most marginalised\u201d, in practice it seems the opposite is true. Some working-class people have said they feel alienated by the predominantly middle-class movement. With protests such as last week\u2019s occupation of Smithfield market \u2013 by XR\u2019s vegan faction \u2013 read by many as an unfair attack on people who were just trying to make a living.\n\nSo where do we go from here? In truth, I don\u2019t have all the answers. But I do know that those of us who feel as though they have been treated as afterthoughts by XR, are growing tired of it. And rightfully so. It\u2019s unfortunate that the most recognised climate justice movement in the country still hasn\u2019t figured out how to appeal to the people for whom the stakes are probably the highest. Until they do, they run the risk of being reduced to a joke, regardless of the good work some, but not enough parts of XR are doing to stop that from happening.", "description": "For all the strides they\u2019ve made, I have a funny feeling about Extinction Rebellion.\u00a0 Of course, I\u2019m not alone.
