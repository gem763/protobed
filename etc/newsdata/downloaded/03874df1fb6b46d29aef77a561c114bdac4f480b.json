The preventive shutoff will not be the first the utility has undertaken this year, but it will be the largest, with parts of Silicon Valley and the coast affected.\n\nRelated: California utility cuts off power to thousands amid wildfire threat\n\n\u201cI wish we weren\u2019t in a situation where, in maybe one of the wealthiest jurisdictions in the world, we are turning power off to large swaths of the population every few weeks,\u201d said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy program at Stanford University. \u201cBut it is better than what we\u2019ve been through, and I very much hope that we get through this fire season without a repeat of 2017 or 2018.\u201d\n\nPG&E declared bankruptcy in January, in part because of potential liabilities from its role in some of the 2017 northern California fires and the 2018 Camp fire that killed a total of 129 people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes.\n\nInvestigators traced the origins of some of the 2017 fires to trees falling on power lines, in some cases trees that should have been cleared by PG&E because of their proximity to the lines. In the Camp fire, a tower constructed in the 1920s, well past its projected lifespan, was implicated as the cause.\n\nThe utility has submitted plans to update its infrastructure, moving its poles and power lines underground in areas of high fire risk, as well as plans to trim vegetation where it could affect its lines and conduct more safety inspections of existing infrastructure.\n\nA Pacific Gas and Electric lineman works to repair a power line in fire-ravaged Paradise, California, in 2018.

To prevent the scale of disaster the state witnessed in years past, power shutoffs may be the best course, he said.\n\n\u201cIs it a huge inconvenience? Yes. Is it going to be dangerous? Yes,\u201d Wara said. \u201cThere are lots of risks on the other side. Someone could die because they have a medical device. But it avoids this risk that still exists in the system of igniting catastrophic fire during really dangerous conditions when things can happen so fast that there is no possibility of fire suppressant being effective.\u201d\n\nWildfires have always been a part of life in California, but not to the level of devastation that required routine major power shutoffs. \u201cThere were bad fires in the 20th century, but more or less, there was a power system that worked,\u201d Wara said. \u201cI think what\u2019s different is the weather extremes are much more extreme and that\u2019s a predictable effect of climate change.\u201d\n\nPG&E should have been maintaining and updating its infrastructure before the crisis reached this point, said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network.\n\n\u201cPG&E should be held to higher standards than this,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wants to see another fire like the fires we\u2019ve seen in the past, but we have to remember that the problem that these shutoffs are hopefully going to address are PG&E\u2019s negligence and incompetence, and PG&E\u2019s propensity to ignite fires.\u201d\n\nNow PG&E customers must bear the burden of navigating possibly days without power, with businesses losing money and people in possibly unsafe situations, Spatt said.\n\n\u201cConsumers would rather have their power shut off than have their homes and businesses burnt down, but they would also rather have a utility that didn\u2019t start fires,\u201d Spatt said.", "description": "With nearly 800,000 customers affected in the largest shutdown this year, the utility is hoping to avoid a devastating fire seasonPacific Gas and Electric, northern California\u2019s utility, has issued a preventative power shutoff to guard against wildfires.
