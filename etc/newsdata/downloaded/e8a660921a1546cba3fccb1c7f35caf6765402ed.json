Saturday opening hours will be from 08:00 to 13:00.\n\nThe statement cautioned taxpayers that assistance would be limited to the submission of personal income tax returns, and helping taxpayers to register for and file on the SARS app.\n\n''Taxpayers are reminded to bring all the necessary supporting documents to avoid frustration,'' said SARS.\n\nTaxpayers meeting all of the following requirements are reminded that they do not have to file a return:\n\nYour total employment income for the year before tax is not more than R500 000.\n\nYou only receive employment income from one employer for the full tax year.\n\nYou have no other form of income (e.g. car allowance, business income, and rental income, taxable interest or income from another job).\n\nYou don\u2019t have any additional allowable tax related deductions to claim (e.g. medical expenses, retirement annuity contributions and travel expenses).\n\n\n\n\n\nSARS encouraged taxpayers to \"do right\", saying that each tax contribution would help to enable and build a \"capable, democratic state that fosters sustainable economic growth and social development\".\n\nThe revenue service has vowed to crack down on non-compliant taxpayers this year. By late July, however, SARS also said it had already paid out R3.5bn in refunds since the start of the tax filing season, Fin24 previously reported. There have also been fewer delays in refunds, according to tax and audit firm Mazars.\n\nThe closing dates for filing personal income tax returns are:\n\nOctober 31, 2019 for for provisional and non-provisional taxpayers who visit a SARS branch for assistance with filing\n\nDecember 4, 2019 for non-provisional taxpayers, who use eFiling or the SARS MobiApp\n\nJanuary 31, 2020 for provisional taxpayers who use eFiling.\n\nQuick links\n\nVisit the SARS eFiling website here: www.sarsefiling.co.za\n\nThe SARS MobiApp is available on GooglePlay and the App Store", "description": "To make it easier for taxpayers to meet the deadlines to file their tax returns, SARS branches will be open from 08:00 to 13:00 during the month of October.", "authors": ["Compiled Allison Jeftha"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7634/903661ecc0614ba5914be58e4b02e9ad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
