Mr. Trump had announced a \"tougher direction\" to curb a months-long surge of Central American families heading to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFrancis Cissna, right, speaks at a Department of Homeland Security news conference in Washington on Tuesday, December 5, 2017. Andrew Harnik / AP\n\nAfter Cissna's departure, the White House tapped former Virginia attorney general and immigration hardliner Ken Cuccinelli to fill the position on an acting basis. Since taking office, Cuccinelli has been outspoken in his support for the president's hardline immigration agenda, becoming the de facto spokesperson for the entire DHS and rolling out the \"public charge\" regulation started under Cissna.\n\nCuccinelli has not been formally nominated for the role, which would require confirmation by the Senate.\n\nDespite his ouster, Cissna received frequent praise from immigration restrictionists during his relatively low-profile tenure leading USCIS. He pushed restrictions on temporary worker visas, launched a sprawling denaturalization campaign and worked to craft the \"public charge\" regulation that will make it more difficult for low-income immigrants to obtain green cards or temporary visas if they use certain welfare benefits.\n\nIt was also during his tenure that USCIS sparked controversy by scrapping the \"nation of immigrants\" passage from its mission statement.\n\nCissna's return to DHS was first reported by BuzzFeed News.", "description": "Former USCIS director Francis Cissna was ousted from his role in June amid a purge of top DHS officials", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/03/0582b3da-4449-449d-8d6f-d5f3bca51270/thumbnail/1200x630g3/667346cc071f85f4237d5a0ef3d64300/ap-17339590689906.jpg"}
