Let them!\u201d Trump mused on Twitter this weekend as Turkish and Syrian troops carved up formerly Kurdish-held territory. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Kurdish forces previously aligned with the United States teamed up with the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, a sworn enemy of the United States, for support amid a Turkish onslaught that Trump apparently greenlit in an Oct. 6 call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Hundreds of Islamic State prisoners are reported to have escaped, with thousands more tenuously held by embattled Kurdish militias. Irregular forces aligned with Turkey have been filmed summarily executing Kurdish prisoners.\n\n\u2026..The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nRepublicans in particular have been scathing in their assessment of the sudden lurch in U.S. policy, calling the move everything from \u201csickening\u201d to a \u201cdisaster in the making.\u201d Even stalwart Trump allies, such as GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have warned him that he\u2019s caved to the Turks, betrayed the Kurds, and left a power vacuum that Assad, his allies the Iranians and the Russians, not to mention remnants of the Islamic State, will rush to fill.\n\nUnder GOP and Democratic pressure, Trump on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Turkey to deter it from further destabilizing Syria and undermining gains made against the Islamic State. The sanctions\u2019 targets include the Turkish defense and energy ministries, as well as the defense, energy and interior ministers. Trump also said he would be raising tariffs on Turkey and halting trade negotiations. Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, meanwhile, will travel to Turkey for talks.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Turkey, a NATO ally, will accede to Trump\u2019s demands. But, in a statement announcing his approval of sanctions, the president nonetheless held firm to his decision to withdraw roughly 1,000 U.S. troops from Syria\u2019s northeast, throwing U.S. commitments in doubt.\n\nBeyond Syria, Trump faces a Middle East on edge. Iran and Saudi Arabia are circling each other in the wake of attacks on each other\u2019s oil tankers. Yemen remains a humanitarian disaster amid ongoing conflict between Saudi-led forces and Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Even Israel, a staunch U.S. ally whose prime minister openly flaunts his close ties to Trump, is reportedly growing queasy with the president\u2019s policies.\n\nFurther afield, Trump has struggled to achieve his goal of a political settlement in Afghanistan, following widespread blowback over his offer to meet with Taliban leaders at Camp David days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nAs foreign policy philosophies go, \u201cLet them!\u201d is unusually laissez-faire, bordering on wishful thinking when it comes to the Middle East. It\u2019s also a strikingly carefree tone for Trump, given that he faces an impeachment inquiry that could threaten his presidency. But Trump has never felt shackled by precedent or norms.\n\nHis predecessors, even when reluctant, bowed to necessity, obligation or a grandiose sense of destiny in staying engaged in the Middle East \u2013 the region is, after all, a major source of the oil that lubricates the global economy as well as the terrorists that have attacked America. Barack Obama, for one, made withdrawing American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan a pillar of his pitch to voters in 2008, only to surge or return forces to those countries on the recommendation of his military advisers.\n\nTrump appears less focused on the global repercussions of his actions than on pleasing his Republican base. And as with his past breaks with GOP orthodoxy on issues like entitlements and trade, he seems largely unconcerned by the opprobrium of Republican elites.\n\nHis tweets have expressed as much, with attacks like the one he leveled on Monday amid a high-volume day of tweeting: \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nTrump may be onto something. A POLITICO-Morning Consult poll covering Oct. 11-13 found that 56 percent of Republicans support Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria, compared with 60 percent of Democrats who oppose it.\n\n\u201cThere is, deep down, a logic to his message,\u201d said Vali Nasr, a prominent Middle East and South Asia analyst. \u201cBut his execution is horrible. And he\u2019s doing too many things all at once.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to leave northeast Syria is sure to come up in a Democratic primary debate on Tuesday. In the vast Democratic field, though, Trump\u2019s calls to stop \u201cendless wars\u201d have found some resonance, including from candidates such as Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And there\u2019s little appetite among Democratic voters for fresh wars in the Middle East.\n\nStill, Trump is nothing if not inconsistent. For every promise he\u2019s made to disentangle the United States from the Middle East, he\u2019s done something at odds with that pledge. Even as U.S. forces were abandoning their positions in northeast Syria, for instance, the Pentagon was sending several thousand new troops to protect Saudi Arabia and its vulnerable oil fields from Iran.\n\nAnd like Obama and other presidents before him, Trump may find that it\u2019s far easier to say you\u2019re getting American troops out of the Middle East than to actually do it. If the Islamic State regains significant territory or launches terrorist attacks traced back to Syria, Trump may have no choice but to intervene.\n\nWhile Trump has shown willingness to punish Turkey over any gains by the Islamic State, he\u2019s also gloated about how the terrorist group \u2013 including thousands of its imprisoned members \u2013 are now Turkey and Europe\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cWe are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. \u201cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\u2019t want the cost. \u2018Let the USA pay,\u2019 they said.\u201d\n\nTrump even alleged that the Kurdish forces would try to trick the U.S. into staying: \u201cKurds may be releasing some to get us involved. Easily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump is not known to be a student of history, but his gut instincts are well grounded: All of his modern predecessors found themselves sucked into the Middle East vortex, and few found it helpful politically.\n\nFor Jimmy Carter, who achieved a historic peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, it was the Iran hostage crisis and a failed U.S. military rescue attempt.\n\nFor Ronald Reagan there was the Beirut barracks bombings and the Iran-Contra scandal. (Reagan\u2019s support of the \u201cmujahideen\u201d in nearby Afghanistan, while at the time credited for weakening the Soviet Union, paved the way for the rise of the Taliban and al Qaeda.)\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush was lauded for his leadership in pushing Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. Even that, however, didn\u2019t help him win reelection, and the stationing of U.S. troops on the Muslim holy land of Saudi Arabia angered al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who masterminded the 9/11 attacks.\n\nBill Clinton pushed hard for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. He failed on that front; he also failed to capture or kill bin Laden.\n\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s entire presidency was consumed by America\u2019s struggle with the Arab and Islamic worlds. The 9/11 attacks happened on his watch, prompting the invasion of Afghanistan and later Iraq. The latter nearly cost him reelection and has largely defined his legacy.\n\nBut the closest analogue to Trump\u2019s fear of the Middle East quicksand may be Barack Obama, for all their differences in style.\n\nAs a candidate, Obama slammed \u201cdumb wars\u201d like Iraq and promised to bring U.S. troops home. He vowed to rebalance America\u2019s foreign policy more toward countering emerging rivals such as China. By the time Obama left office, the U.S. still had thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, not to mention hundreds in Syria battling the Islamic State. His much-vaunted \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d made limited progress.\n\nObama also was inconsistent: He was willing to militarily intervene in Libya amid the Arab Spring uprisings, but resisted calls to do so against the Assad regime, even after the brutal Syrian dictator crossed Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d and used chemical weapons. Obama later told The Atlantic that he was proud of his restraint.\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders say the criticism of his decision to pull U.S. forces back from northeast Syria has been hysterical and overblown, and that, given Turkey\u2019s determination to launch its incursion, he had little choice but to remove U.S. troops from harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cThe fate of Syria has never been a vital interest for the U.S. It\u2019s always been in the orbit of Iran and Russia,\u201d James Carafano, an analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote in an email. While he acknowledged the Turkish operation could spark chaos that could strengthen the Islamic State, Russia, Assad and Iran, he said it\u2019s \u201c too soon to tell\u201d how things would play out.\n\nTrump supporters, noting the recent troop deployments to Saudi Arabia, say that he has shown no serious signs of backing off on his \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d against Iran. Trump aides view Iran as the main threat to U.S. allies and interests in the Middle East given its history of anti-Americanism and use of proxy forces throughout the region.\n\nYet even on Iran, Trump has wavered from hostility to conciliation. He abandoned the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by Obama and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran, to the delight of the Saudis, Israelis and other partners. But he\u2019s repeatedly sought to talk directly to Iran\u2019s president and has even shown interest in striking a deal similar to the one he quit. After Iran downed a U.S drone earlier this year, Trump nearly approved a military strike on the country -- only to back off at the last moment.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Now, \u201cthere no longer seems to be a point at which the U.S. will hold firm.\u201d\n\nFor now, there are few signs that Trump\u2019s Syria gambit will weaken his support among Republicans who wish to shield him from impeachment. For the most part, Republican senators have avoided attacking him by name, and his most vocal critic on the issue -- Lindsey Graham -- remains one of his closest Senate allies.\n\nFor Democrats hoping to unseat Trump, the Syria pullback offers an opportunity to distinguish themselves. But the only major candidate with much foreign policy experience to speak of, former vice president Joe Biden, has a tricky balancing act to pull off, given his intimate involvement in Obama-era decisions that haunt U.S. Middle East policy today.\n\nFor now, Biden and some of the other candidates are accusing Trump of betraying the Kurds, but saying little about how they might approach Syria differently.\n\n\u201cOur troops are left in the middle of a war with no plan other than retreat,\u201d Biden tweeted. \u201c[Trump] has failed as Commander-in-Chief to safeguard our country & protect our troops.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8a/87/9bf28865468294420f3bdfc9f3db/191014-trump-wh-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
