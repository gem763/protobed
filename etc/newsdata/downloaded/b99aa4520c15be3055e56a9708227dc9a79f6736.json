Andrew Burton for The New York Times It means fighting back tears outside a school or shopping mall full of spent bullet casings when the interviewee before you is bawling. Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times It means sitting at kitchen tables or in diner stalls or at dimly lit bars and asking personal questions of people you barely know. Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nTimes Insider How The Times Covers the United States Ahead of a Pivotal Election With one of the largest teams of national correspondents in the business, we help the country to understand itself. Watch with us on Tuesday as we co-sponsor the Democratic debate.\n\nTimes Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n\nThe New York Times, which co-sponsors Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate with CNN, has one of the largest teams of national correspondents in the business. They work out of office towers in big cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, and out of home offices in neighborhoods around Albuquerque, Boston and Miami.\n\nBut more often than not, their offices are their cars \u2014 company-issued Chevrolet Malibus generally \u2014 which collectively rack up hundreds of thousands of miles a year.\n\n\u201cRandomly call up your smart source on the pork council to discuss the meaning of life. Put the notebook away over beers. Read amended complaints, restroom graffiti and Bible tracts. Take kids seriously.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Richard Fausset, the bureau chief in Atlanta, on his techniques for capturing the country.\n\nRichard showed his skill at lingering and listening recently when he documented the sad final days of a weekly newspaper in Warroad, Minn. He transported us to the newsroom of The Warroad Pioneer as part of our series on the collapse of local news outlets.\n\nDying Gasp of One Local Newspaper The Warroad Pioneer, a pillar of its small Minnesota town, ended its 121-year run with bloody marys, bold type and gloom about the void it would leave behind. Jack Neumiller, 51. \u201cI know everyone I talk to is not happy that we don\u2019t have a paper anymore. I think it\u2019s devastating to lose a local paper.\u201d Tim Gruber for The New York Times\n\nOne of our most important missions, which prompted us to get involved in this debate, is to help the country understand itself. When there\u2019s a historic presidential race like the one unfolding now, that imperative becomes even more essential. Our goal is to reveal to our readers the state of the country, and how the state of the country is shaping its politics.\n\n\u201cI hope to surprise \u2014 to surprise my readers with the multifaceted experiences of people of faith, and to surprise the people I write about with the quality and fairness of The New York Times\u2019s reporting.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Elizabeth Dias, who travels far from her home base in Washington, D.C., on covering religion.\n\nElizabeth drew praise from readers across the political spectrum when she wrote about a Tennessee woman who used to attend anti-abortion protests but now runs a center that tries to address some of the reasons women get abortions in the first place.\n\nBaby Food, Bassinets and Talk of Salvation: Inside an Evangelical Pregnancy Center The director used to attend anti-abortion protests. Now she tries to help pregnant women and new mothers find jobs, emotional support or a place to shower. Wendy Ramsey, the director of Options, held a 3-week-old while the baby\u2019s mother selected donated items from shelves inside Lincoln Avenue Baptist Church. Audra Melton for The New York Times\n\nIf traditional political coverage is about getting inside campaigns to understand their strategy, or assessing how various candidates would run the country based on their records, Times coverage is also about seeing the nation from the ground up \u2014 from the points of view of all kinds of Americans \u2014 and asking them questions that go well beyond whom they plan to vote for on Election Day.\n\nWe\u2019re not in search of quick sound-bites, but rather insights into what is on the minds of people far from our headquarters near Times Square, where our team of editors is based.\n\nWorking together with our excellent Politics team, our national correspondents, frequent fliers all, roam far and wide across the country to get to the next story. The datelines atop their stories, which indicate where they filed them from, may be LOS ANGELES, HOUSTON or MIAMI. But they could just as well be COMPTON, Calif.; ANAHUAC, Tex.; or HOMESTEAD, Fla.\n\nWhere Times reporters filed stories in 2019 By Jeremy White\n\n\u201cI think of that old story about the reporter who came into the Deep South after Homer Bigart, the great Times correspondent, and approached someone Bigart had just spent time with. \u2018He was so stupid,\u2019 the person said. \u2018I had to tell him everything.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 Campbell Robertson, a correspondent based in Pittsburgh, on the importance of listening rather than talking.\n\nCampbell recently spent time in Appalachia, documenting subtle trends such as how Letcher County in Kentucky managed to have one of the greatest shifts in the gender balance of the work force in the country.\n\nIn a small town called Fleming-Neon, Ky., he met Amanda Lucas, whose husband had had a mining job before that industry went bust. \u201cWe had a good life,\u201d she told Campbell, whom one can imagine nodding knowingly and not saying a word.\n\nIn Coal Country, the Mines Shut Down, the Women Went to Work and the World Quietly Changed From 2010 to 2017, Letcher County in Kentucky saw a greater shift in the gender balance of its labor force than almost any other county in the United States. As she and her husband watched the coal business falling apart, Amanda Lucas decided to go back to school to train for the job she now holds as a respiratory therapist. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times\n\nAmerica is a place where emotions vary widely, from elation to despair, so we\u2019re careful not to over-generalize the circumstances of the people we bump into on the road.\n\nWe\u2019re not conducting polls, although polling and data inform what correspondents do. Our job is not to predict the outcome of an election but to make sure that, regardless of which candidates come out on top, we show readers the forces behind Americans\u2019 political choices. Whether people are feeling anger, fear or hope, we try to catalog it. If there are big trends or changes occurring in the country, we seek to reveal them.\n\n\u201cIt is a privilege to travel the country and see so many things, to be inside so many people\u2019s homes, to hear so many stories. I believe it\u2019s my responsibility to ask the questions our readers would want to ask their neighbors or their political leaders if they could be by my side.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Julie Turkewitz, a national correspondent based in Denver, on the pride she takes in getting off the beaten path out West.\n\nJulie relishes those \u201clong freewheeling conversations\u201d with strangers, neighbors, friends, and friends of friends that provide a window into \u201ctheir lives, jobs, opportunities, current place in the world.\u201d\n\nWho Gets to Own the West? A new group of billionaires is shaking up the landscape. Payette River canyon in Smiths Ferry, Idaho. Parts of the area are now owned by Dan and Farris Wilks, leaders among a new class of landowners who are buying up vast parcels of the West. Max Whittaker for The New York Times\n\n\u201cMy job is not just to say what the person thinks, but to get under the skin and try to explain why they think that. What is it about this person\u2019s life that has brought them to their politics? What were the emotional pivots that caused them to end up here?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sabrina Tavernise on how she views her mission as a national correspondent.\n\nSabrina captured the effects of the decision by General Motors to stop producing cars at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, not far from where Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate will be held. A man named Rick Marsh was losing the only real job he\u2019d had in the past 25 years, and didn\u2019t put much faith in the parade of politicians who were lamenting the closing. \u201cThey are so out of touch with reality and real people,\u201d he told Sabrina. \u201cAll of them.\u201d\n\nWith His Job Gone, an Autoworker Wonders, \u2018What Am I as a Man?\u2019 Rick Marsh worked in the car plant in Lordstown his entire life. Now that job is gone. What does that mean for his politics? Losing his job after 25 years on the General Motors payroll, Mr. Marsh prepared to apply for unemployment. Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times\n\n\u201cFew topics in American life are as polarizing and misunderstood as race. I try to get people to reflect sincerely, bluntly, and often in ways they never have before, on how race influences their experiences and perceptions. I know I\u2019ve hit gold when the stories upend the easy assumptions and stereotypes that we all have about race.\u201d\n\n\u2014 John Eligon, a national correspondent based in Kansas City, on the challenges of writing subtle pieces about hot-button issues like race.\n\nJohn described the soul searching that took place at a racially mixed high school in Owatonna, Minn., after a white student posted a racial slur on Snapchat.\n\nFew Talked About Race at This School. Then a Student Posted a Racist Slur. When white students at a Minnesota school posted a slur to Snapchat, black classmates demanded action. Their efforts led to uncomfortable conversations about race. Owatonna High School is in the predominantly white town of Owatonna, Minn. Black children make up about 7 percent of Owatonna High\u2019s 1,400 student population. Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times\n\nTimes national correspondents got together recently to discuss what questions they would most like to ask the 12 Democratic presidential candidates who will be on the stage in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday night. Their list was long. Their topics were varied. One night would not be enough time to tackle them.\n\nTo see what questions the candidates end up having to answer, follow along with Times coverage of the debate, which starts at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.", "description": "With one of the largest teams of national correspondents in the business, we help the country to understand itself.
