The notes are senior secured obligations of the issuer and have direct security of the two wind-power operating projects directly held by the ReNew holding company (ReNew holdco) - the 90MW Kod-Limbwas project and the 51MW Pratapgarh project - along with a pledge of over 100% of the equity shares and 62% of the preference shares of ReNew Power Services Private Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of ReNew that holds the assets acquired by ReNew in its acqusition of Ostro Energy in April 2018). The US dollar notes also include a USD20 million interest service reserve account (ISRA). This final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received and is in line with the expected rating assigned on 30 July 2019. ReNew is one of India's leading renewable independent power producers (IPP), with around 4.7GW of operational capacity of wind (66%) and solar (34%) power projects and a project pipeline of around 3.5GW. ReNew holdco directly holds 485MW of the wind-power assets, with the rest held by various SPVs. ReNew plans to use the proceeds from the US dollar notes to fund its capex. We do not expect ReNew's net debt to rise with this note issuance as the company intends to use the USD300 million raised from its rights issue in June 2019 to repay existing borrowings over the next two years. Key Rating Drivers Leading Producer with Diversified Presence: ReNew's large size and diversified renewable-asset portfolio provide it with economies of scale and operating leverage, mitigating concentration risk. Its project portfolio is diversified across original equipment manufacturer suppliers and also geographically, with no single Indian state accounting for more than 25% of the total portfolio. Price Certainty, Volume Risk: We believe the long-term power-purchase agreements (PPA) for the ReNew group's operating assets offer price certainty and long-term cash flow visibility. The majority of the assets, representing 96% of group capacity, have PPAs with state-owned power-distribution companies or sovereign-backed entities with tenor of around 20-25 years, and a long remaining life: the weighted-average operating life for the group's assets is around three years. PPAs for the balance of the capacity have a shorter duration, ranging from eight-10 years. The long-term PPAs provide protection from price risk, but production volume will vary based on resource availability, which is affected by seasonal and climatic patterns. Weak Counterparty Profile: The rating reflects the weak credit profile of ReNew group's key counterparties - state-owned power-distribution utilities. These account for about 60% of group total capacity, including projects under development. Around 36% of the offtake is tied up with sovereign-backed entities - Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd. with 27%, NTPC Limited (NS: ) (BBB-/Stable) with 6% and PTC India (NS: ) Limited with 3% - which have more timely payment records. The remaining 4% is sold directly to corporate customers, increasing the diversity of counterparties. Growth to Moderate; Event Risk: We expect the pace of organic growth to slow due to ReNew's large base and slower capacity additions in India's renewable sector in the near-to-medium term. ReNew has doubled its operational capacity, via organic and inorganic growth, in each of the last three years and has followed a policy of raising equity before committing to a project. Under-construction pipeline capacity of 3.5GW poses some execution risk, but this is mitigated by ReNew's execution record and operational capability. We have not factored in any acquisitions and will treat one as an event risk; a large-scale debt-funded acquisition may hamper our expectations of an improvement in ReNew's credit profile. Improving Financial Profile: ReNew's financial profile is likely to improve on positive cash flow from operating capacity and slower growth in capacity additions. We have deconsolidated the EBITDAR and debt of ReNew's two restricted groups - Neerg Energy Ltd (senior notes rated B+) and ReNew RG II (senior secured notes rated BB) - to calculate its credit metrics; EBITDAR incorporates our expectations of the cash it receives from the two restricted groups. Net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR is likely to fall below 5.0x by the financial year ending March 2022 (FY22) (FY19: 7.1x), and remain around 5.0x-5.5x thereafter as capacity additions pick up modestly. EBITDAR/net interest coverage should improve to around 1.9x by FY22 (FY19: 1.4x). Adequate Holding-Company Liquidity: Fitch expects ReNew holdco to benefit from the operating cash flow from its 485MW of wind-power assets and cash upstreaming (including interest on shareholder debt, intercompany loans and dividends) from the operating assets held at various subsidiaries. We believe this cash flow provides sufficient liquidity at ReNew holdco, with an interest-coverage ratio, including cash upstreaming from operating subsidiaries, of well above 2x through the tenor of the notes. The diversity of projects across geographies, resource types and counterparties should limit volatility in cash upstreaming from the operating subsidiaries. Fitch also expects the EBITDA from the two projects, provided as direct security for the US dollar notes, to be sufficient to cover 0.9x to 1.0x of the annual interest expense for the notes, including the hedging costs. No Notching for Subordination: Fitch does not notch down the US dollar note rating in light of our assessment of at least average recovery for noteholders. The assessment factors in the subordination of notes to other secured debt at ReNew holdco and to prior-ranking project debt at the operating entities in the group. An increase in prior-ranking debt may result in higher subordination, leading to a reassessment by Fitch. Currency Hedging, Refinancing Risk: ReNew's earnings will be in rupees, but the notes are denominated in US dollars, resulting in exposure to foreign-exchange risk. However, ReNew plans to mitigate the risk by substantially hedging both the coupon and principal of the notes. The US dollar notes face refinancing risk, as we estimate the cash balance at ReNew will be insufficient to repay the notes at maturity. However, this risk is mitigated by ReNew's proven access to debt and equity funding. Derivation Summary Fitch sees Greenko Energy Holdings (BB-/Stable) and Concord New Energy Group Limited (CNE, BB-/Stable) as ReNew's close peers. Greenko, like ReNew, is one of India's leading power producers, with a focus on renewable energy. Both have total operating capacity in excess of 4GW, although Greenko's is somewhat lower than ReNew's, and both have expanded their operating capacity by 4x-5x over the last three years, including through an inorganic route. Both are exposed to construction risk and have similar counterparty exposure and financial profiles. ReNew has larger unrestricted capacity than Greenko, totalling around 7GW, which offers better granularity. ReNew's resource risk is lower with higher exposure of 39% to solar-based projects (Greenko: 27%), and counterparty risk is also lower with 43% of unrestricted capacity contracted with sovereign-owned entities and the balance with state-owned distribution companies. On the other hand, ReNew has higher construction risk with half of its capacity still under construction. Greenko's credit assessment also derives support from its strong shareholders - Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. These shareholders, in addition to putting in equity, have also introduced stronger risk-management practices at Greenko over the years, including the commitment from management towards deleveraging. These factors combined result in a similar credit assessment, in our view. CNE has an attributable wind capacity of 2,277MW across multiple projects in China. CNE's feed-in tariffs are stable and its counterparty risk is lower as its revenue stream is mostly reliant on State Grid Corporation of China (A+/Stable) and China's Renewable Energy Subsidy Fund. However, CNE's cash flow, similar to other Chinese wind-power operators, is significantly affected by the time lag in the receipt of renewable subsidies, which accounted for 42% of its power revenue in 2018. Fitch expects CNE's financial profile to be stronger than that of ReNew, with funds from operations (FFO) fixed-charge coverage of more than 2.5x compared with below 2.0x. However, ReNew's considerably larger size and diversified wind and solar portfolio lead to a similar credit assessment for both. ReNew benefits from a stronger business profile than Neerg Energy due to its much larger scale, which results in better project diversification across geographies, superior counterparty mix and a higher share of more stable solar assets. The credit metrics of Neerg Energy and ReNew are similar, but cash flow at the ReNew holdco are subordinated to debt at the operating subsidiaries. However, we believe ReNew holdco's access to operating cash flow from its 485MW of wind-power assets, together with the diversity of cash upstreamed from operating subsidiaries, limits the subordination, resulting in no notching for the US dollar notes. These factors, combined with ReNew holdco's better leverage and coverage ratios, lead to a rating that is one notch higher than that of Neerg Energy. Key Assumptions Fitch's Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer - Plant-load factors ranging from 17% to 42% for all assets, in line with historical performance or resource assessment studies - Plant-wise tariff in accordance with respective PPAs - EBITDA margins of 80%-93% for all assets, in line with historical performance or management guidance - Gradual improvement of average receivable days to around 120 (FY19: 147 days) - New bids or acquisitions from FY22 following completion of current pipeline of 3.5GW - No dividend payout in the medium term RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Improved leverage, measured by net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR, to below 4.5x on a sustained basis (FY19: 7.1x) Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Adjusted EBITDAR net fixed-charge coverage at below 1.5x for a sustained period for both ReNew and the holdco - Net adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR of above 5.5x for a sustained period - Significant and prolonged deterioration of the receivable position - Failure to adequately mitigate foreign-exchange risk Liquidity and Debt Structure Comfortable Liquidity: ReNew's readily available cash and cash equivalents as of FYE19 were around INR25.6 billion against current debt maturities of around INR36.2 billion. Current debt maturities include short-term borrowings of INR20.7 billion in the form of working-capital loans, acceptances and buyer's or supplier's credit, which are relatively easy to refinance. We expect the company to generate negative free cash flow in the near-to-medium term due to the ongoing capacity additions. However, ReNew has a policy and record of raising equity in advance for its projects and it has adequate access to the domestic bank loan market. ReNew has staggered debt maturities, with the majority of the debt in the form of amortising project-level loans (tenor in the range of 13-23 years) and two tranches of US dollar notes (Neerg Energy: USD475 million due 2022 and ReNew RG II: USD435 million due 2024).
