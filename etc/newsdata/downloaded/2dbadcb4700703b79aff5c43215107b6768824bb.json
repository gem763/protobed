Many New Yorkers don't have the luxury of an elevator, and even if they do, it certainly isn't easy to drag a six-foot-tall tree inside. Enter: Tyler's Trees.\n\nTyler's Trees began in 2007 after its founders, Tyler Kupper and Brian Millman, witnessed a fellow Manhattanite struggling to carry a tree back to his apartment. Now, the company works to realize its vision of \"taking the hassle out of Christmas\" by delivering trees, setting them up in stands (which can be included), and making them look extra pretty with tree skirts.\n\nThe Frasier fir tree packages start at $129 for a five-foot-tree (and go up to $370 for a nine-foot tree), but why stop there? Add-on options include decorating (see below), lighting, and a garland or wreath. They also offer removal services starting at $69, because if you didn't set it up, why should you have to take it down?\n\nView photos Photo credit: Courtesy More\n\nThe delivery doesn't stop at nine-foot trees. For the Christmas decor enthusiasts who want trees towering up to more than 16 feet, the company offers an even higher level of service: Tyler's Trees Elite. With this option, one of the Tyler's Trees employees will pay a visit to your home before the delivery date to check out dimensions, tree placement, and anything else that could stand in the way of you and your 12-foot monstrosity.\n\nBut of course I couldn't just talk about the company\u2014I had to try it, too. During a recent drop-off, two delivery men named Justin and David completed their work in a staggeringly quick five minutes.\n\n\"The top branch is a little too high for this location,\" Justin told me. \"We can manicure it for you or we can relocate the tree.\"\n\nI chose to have it manicured, and Justin snipped the top branch to make it fit perfectly under my ceiling.\n\nAfter some final touches and a spiel about how to keep my tree alive, they were off to deliver another of the 20+ trees they planned to deliver that day.", "description": "One less thing to worry about this holiday season.", "authors": ["Sam Dangremond"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l8uIgvPN6I8tlEwoCd6ovg--~B/aD03MjU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/dcd0fc3f294da5c4f1fb00f59a7859e3", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
