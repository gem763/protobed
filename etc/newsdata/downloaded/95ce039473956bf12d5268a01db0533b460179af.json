We feel like it\u2019s much better he plays rugby than goes out and eats beef.\n\n\u201cHe loves playing rugby, the best way to keep him fit is to play him and he\u2019s an influential player in our team.\u201d\n\nJones said the emphasis would be about cutting out the mistakes on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of effort in our game on Sunday but not the execution,\u201d added Jones. \u201cSo we are looking forward to executing a little bit more in attack and being even more physical in defence.\u201d\n\nJones had said on Monday that the game against a well-rested U.S. team would be like playing against \u201c15 Donald Trumps\u201d, expecting the confident Americans to hold nothing back in their first game in Japan.\n\nFour of the five players attached to English Premiership clubs in the U.S. squad have made coach Gary Gold\u2019s starting line-up, including Sale Sharks flyhalf AJ MacGinty, while former Leicester Tigers back Blaine Scully will captain the side.\n\nThe youngest member of the squad, 19-year-old David Ainuu, gets to start at loosehead prop and Gold said he brings a lot to the table despite his inexperience.\n\n\u201cEnergy, workrate, enthusiasm and hunger,\u201d said Gold of the Tolouse prop. \u201cHe\u2019s worked so incredibly hard over the two or three months that we\u2019ve been together. He\u2019s grown from strength to strength, literally and figuratively.\u201d", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones expects the United States to play with huge self-belief and confidence when the teams clash in the Rugby World Cup on Thursday.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433349585&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N161", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
