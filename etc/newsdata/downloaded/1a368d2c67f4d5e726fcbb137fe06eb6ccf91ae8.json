Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez To Endorse Bernie Sanders", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) plans to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the race for the White House, their campaigns said on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Washington Post was the first to report that the rising progressive star planned to back the senator. HuffPost has confirmed the endorsement, which will be publicly announced at a rally in New York on Saturday.\n\nSanders has faced questions about his health and fitness during the 2020 race after suffering a heart attack earlier this month, although he moved to downplay those fears during the fourth Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders said during the debate, thanking supporters and fellow candidates for their words of support. \u201cI just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d\n\nThe endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez is a major political win for Sanders, and one of the most coveted of the 2020 cycle.\n\nSanders will also pick up two other prominent progressive endorsements later this week. CNN first reported that freshman Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) plan to throw their support behind Sanders on Saturday.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who the final member of \u201cthe Squad\u201d of four liberal congresswomen, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), will support.\n\nSanders remains a front-runner in the Democratic race, and his campaign reported more than $25 million in campaign donations in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nBut the Vermont senator has been dropping in the polls, and all eyes were on his progressive rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), during Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio.\n\nThis is a developing story.
