The vice president heads a U.S. delegation that also includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey goes onto Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria, it\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States,\u201d Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nAs he seeks to push Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to agree to a cease-fire, Pence will confront doubts about American credibility and his own, as an emissary of an inconsistent president.\n\nA vice president\u2019s ability \u201cto have an impact on foreign policy stems from his relationship with the president and his ability to speak credibly for the president,\u201d said Jeffrey Prescott, the Obama administration\u2019s senior director for Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Gulf states on the National Security Council and a former deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cGiven how erratic president Trump\u2019s decision-making process and style has been, it\u2019s just hard to imagine any country on the receiving end of another interlocutor really being confident that what Pence and Pompeo are delivering reflects Trump\u2019s thinking at the moment or what it will be in the future,\u201d Prescott said.\n\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal effectively abandoned Kurdish forces once allied with the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe trip comes at a perhaps the darkest moment for the modern U.S.-Turkey relationship and a time of trial for Trump and his Republican Party allies. Trump\u2019s failure to deter Erdogan\u2019s assault on the Kurds, and his subsequent embrace of Turkish talking points about the former U.S. allies, sparked bipartisan outrage and calls for swift punishment for the NATO ally.\n\nEven as he advertised the Pence trip to protect the Kurds, Trump suggested Wednesday that a Kurdish group was a greater terror threat than the Islamic State, and he welcomed the efforts of Russia and the Assad government to fill the void left by the U.S.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the U.S. relationship with the Kurds \u201ca great alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we are where we are. I hope the Vice President and the secretary of state can somehow repair the damage,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nA former Pence adviser noted that Trump has tasked Pence with sensitive diplomatic missions before, including ratcheting up pressure on North Korea around the Winter Olympics last year, which helped pave the way for talks between Trump and Kim Jong Un.\n\nFew details about the trip have been released, but the White House said Pence will meet Thursday with Erdogan to deliver the message that the U.S. will \u201cmaintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached.\u201d\n\nBut Erdogan has publicly stated that he will be undeterred by the sanctions and resisted calls for a cease-fire Wednesday, saying the fighting would end only if Kurdish fighters abandoned their weapons and retreated from positions near the Turkish border.\n\nBut even if Pence can convince Turkey to agree to a cease-fire, which will almost certainly require more leverage than the economic sanctions imposed Monday on Turkey, experts warn it will not erase the signal Trump\u2019s action sent to American allies across the globe or the opening already exploited by Russia in the region.\n\n\u201cDeterring an action that hasn\u2019t yet been taken is almost always easier than trying to coerce someone to reverse an action that they\u2019ve already committed blood, treasure and honor to,\u201d said John Hannah, former national security adviser for former Vice President Dick Cheney and a senior counselor for Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s comments about the crisis drew condemnation on Capitol Hill, two senior administration officials raised alarm that the hastily organized trip lacked achievable goals, with one calling it \u2018half-baked\u2019 and undermined by Trump even before it began. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.\n\nAykan Erdemir, a former member of the Turkish Parliament and a senior fellow at FDD, said that Pence may succeed with Erdogan where Trump failed because he is viewed as a \u201ctough negotiator\u201d in contrast to Trump, who has placed value on international \u201cfriendships\u201d with leaders with authoritarian tendencies.\n\n\u201cErdogan only respects and responds favorably to leaders who he believes are not pushovers,\u201d he said, noting that Pence is viewed in Turkey as the chief U.S. advocate for the economic sanctions that led Erdogan to free American pastor Andrew Brunson in 2018.\n\nErdogan faces global condemnation for the invasion but also sees renewed nationalistic fervor at home, and any pathway to de-escalation, Erdemir said, would likely need to delicately avoid embarrassing Erdogan at home.\n\nPence, he added, is \u201cmore about action than talk, and in that way he\u2019s a good match for Erdogan in these conditions.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence departs for Turkey to undertake arguably his most significant mission yet, seeking to halt a weeklong assault", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/89d1b5_trump-us-syria-48098-mike-pence-vice-president-mike-pence-listens-as-treasury-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
