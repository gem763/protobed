(Mukhtar Khan/AP)\n\nIndian authorities have charged Farooq Abdullah, the most senior mainstream politician in Kashmir and a serving member of the Indian Parliament, under a controversial law that allows detentions of up to two years without trial.\n\nThe detention of Abdullah, 81, is part of India\u2019s ongoing clampdown in Kashmir that began on Aug. 5 after the government announced it would strip the region of its autonomy and statehood.\n\nIndia has arrested politicians, lawyers, activists, party workers, young men and some minors in the crackdown, describing them as threats to public order or likely to participate in violent protests that could turn deadly.\n\nAbdullah was charged on Sunday night under the Public Safety Act, said Munir Khan, a senior police official in Kashmir. He declined to describe the nature of the accusations against Abdullah. The law permits bureaucrats to order lengthy detentions that are reviewed by advisory boards, not sitting judges.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been detained in Kashmir since Aug. 5, including the region\u2019s most prominent mainstream political leaders. Many of the politicians are being held at a hotel-turned-detention center on the shores of Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s capital.\n\nSuch politicians are neither separatists nor militants but represent the pro-India camp in Kashmiri politics: They have taken the position that Kashmir\u2019s future rests within India, although with a degree of autonomy to be determined through dialogue.\n\nAbdullah served as the chief minister of the state of Jammu and Kashmir three times and is a current member of the upper house of India\u2019s Parliament. Two other former state chief ministers, Omar Abdullah, Farooq\u2019s son, and Mehbooba Mufti, were also detained.\n\nSome of the detentions are being carried out under provisions in India\u2019s criminal procedure code that allow preventive arrests to maintain peace. Others, however, are taking place under the auspices of the Public Safety Act, a law that critics describe as draconian. Authorities have used the statute to detain young people they accuse of engaging in stone-throwing protests or of joining militant groups that have waged a long-running anti-India insurgency.\n\nIt is not clear what the nature of the allegations are against Abdullah, a veteran politician who most recently met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi just days before the move to scrap Kashmir\u2019s autonomy.\n\nAbdullah was placed under a form of house arrest soon after Aug. 5. His detention was later challenged in India\u2019s Supreme Court by a fellow member of Parliament. Experts said that charging Abdullah under the stringent Public Safety Act is likely a means to justify his continued detention.\n\nFamilies of detained politicians and party workers say they fear that challenging their relatives\u2019 arrests will only land them in further legal jeopardy, for instance in the form of fresh charges under the Public Safety Act.\n\nShahnawaz Ahmad Mir, who was a youth leader for the People\u2019s Democratic Party, a mainstream party in Kashmir, was arrested at his home in the wee hours of Aug. 5. His family said he had started political activity earlier this year and that his grandfather had been killed by anti-India militants. Mir has been held at the main jail in Srinagar under a form of preventive detention.\n\nHis wife Naziya Lone said that during a recent brief visit, Mir looked pale and emaciated.\n\n\u201cIt is depressing that he has been treated like a hardened criminal,\u201d she said. Mir\u2019s uncle, Ghulam Hassan Mir, said that the way his nephew and other pro-India politicians have been treated has \u201cbroken the trust between India and Kashmiris.\u201d\n\nIshfaq Naseem in Srinagar contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocked up and shut down: How India has silenced opposition to its crackdown in Kashmir\n\nIn teenager\u2019s death, a battle over the truth in Kashmir\n\nModi\u2019s radical move on Kashmir takes India into uncharted territory\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "More than 3,000 people have been detained in Kashmir since Aug. 5", "authors": ["Joanna Slater", "Foreign Correspondent Covering South Asia", "Niha Masih", "Foreign Correspondent Covering India", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wxmQb5X1rPtBh5SehXKAZ_eC6iE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ONAURBWYOII6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
