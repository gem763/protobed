With Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay due to hold talks with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says a new Brexit deal can be reached before the 31 October deadline. He's told Sky News a meeting with Boris Johnson on Monday was \"rather positive\", with the prime minister echoing his cautious optimism by saying: \"I don't want to exaggerate the progress that we are making, but we are making progress.\"\n\nThe BBC also understands \"live discussions\" are taking place between the EU and UK about ruling out another delay to Brexit if a deal is agreed.

First, of course, one would have to be struck.\n\nGlobal climate strikes under way\n\nThousands of people - many of them youngsters - have gathered in Sydney, as global \"climate strike\" protests get under way in Australia. Millions of children are expected to join demonstrations that follow the sun around the earth throughout the day, culminating in mass protests in New York where 1.1 million youngsters have been given permission to skip school. Young campaigner Greta Thunberg, who will join the New York rally, describes the scenes down under as \"incredible\".\n\nFollow the day's events on our live page, get a quick explanation of climate change through our espresso guide, or bone up on how the UK is responding to the threat of global warning through our in-depth BBC Briefing on energy.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nThe 'most open' Rugby World Cup for years\n\nIn just a few hours time in Tokyo, hosts Japan will kick off seven weeks of intense competition with the opening match of the Rugby World Cup against Russia.
