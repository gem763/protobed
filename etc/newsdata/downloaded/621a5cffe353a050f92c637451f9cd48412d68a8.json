But honestly, one of my favourite ways to bond with my boys is to dust off our old game consoles and join them for a go at one of my favourite childhood video games.\n\nYou know \u2014 the games that gave you Nintendo-thumb \u2014 or the ones where you know all the shortcuts and hidden secrets.\n\nTrust me, you are going to love playing through this list of ten classic video games with your kids.\n\nThere are many ways to revisit these classic video games. For instance, you can pull out your old consoles if you still have them handy like we do. Obviously, it's more fun this way because you get to use the original controllers or even blow on the cartridges to make sure they work.\n\nOr you could invest in one of the new preloaded classic consoles that Nintendo has released over the past couple of years: the NES Classic Edition and the SNES Classic Edition. But they might be hard to track down. I know they sold out quickly when they were first released!\n\nYou'll Also Love: 17 Beautiful Indigenous Comic Books And Video Games For Kids\n\nFinally, you can download your favourites onto the Virtual Console for Wii U from the Nintendo eShop.\n\nRegardless of how you choose to play, I can guarantee that your kids will have a blast playing these classic video games with you!\n\n1. Super Mario Bros. (NES)\n\nI think the best place to start when it comes to classic video games is this game. Super Mario Bros. is my childhood in a nutshell. It is the first video game we ever owned. My kids adore playing this game! And I love being able to show them some of the shortcuts.\n\n2. Super Mario Bros. 3 (NES)\n\nThis game is one of my favourite Mario games! It was all about the raccoon suit in this game.\n\n3. Duck Hunt (NES)\n\nI have so many fond memories playing Duck Hunt with my brothers when I was a little girl. I wish I still had a working NES gun, but, alas, I don't.\n\n4. Ice Hockey (NES)\n\nI swear that every single time I play against my husband, the score is extremely lopsided. He dominates this game! It's the quickest game of hockey you'll ever play, but the smiles and giggles you will get from the kids is totally worth it when they see the most ridiculous hockey scores ever.\n\n5. Dr. Mario (NES)\n\nDr. Mario is such a fun Tetris-like game. The music from this game brings back so many memories, so even if I'm just watching my kids play the game, I'm content to just listen to the music.\n\nYou'll Also Love: Top 10 Favourite Family Board Games\n\n6. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (SEGA Genesis)\n\nExperiencing the extremely fast and chaotic nature of the Sonic games is a must. Nothing beats speeding through a level only to suddenly hit some spikes and have your collection of rings go flying. Or the panic that sets in when you are underwater and the music gets faster and faster and you need to find a bubble ASAP. The kids will love speeding through the levels as Sonic, or his trusty pal, Tails.\n\n7. Super Mario Kart (SNES)\n\nSuper Mario Kart was so much fun for me as a kid, especially the battle mode. This game was another of my all-time favourites, which means I know all the shortcuts in the levels. It's certainly a challenge for my kids to keep up with my mad Mario Kart skills.\n\n8. Super Mario World (SNES)\n\nThis game is my all-time favourite of all video games ever. I know alllllll the secrets. I could play this game with my eyes closed. Well, maybe not, but you get the point. Playing Super Mario World with my kids makes me insanely happy, even if it's because I can dazzle them with all the hidden secrets they wouldn't have known about.\n\n9. F-Zero (SNES)\n\nI love everything about this game: the music; the fast speed and, of course, the crazy courses! If you are looking for a fast-paced racing game, then F-Zero is a must.\n\n10. Yoshi's Cookie (SNES)\n\nI adore puzzle games and Yoshi's Cookie definitely ranks as one of the best in my books. I remember introducing my oldest to this game a few years ago and he loved how challenging this game could be.\n\nWhat classic video games do you enjoy playing with your kids?
