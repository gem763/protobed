It was vital for us to put a stop to the statistics everyone has been talking about. And sometimes it doesn't matter how the goals come, a win over Portugal and a clean sheet is what counts.\n\nThere will probably be an element of relief among the players, but overall we deserved to win the game, and I don't think anyone can argue about that.\n\nI was pleased to see Lucy Staniforth come into the starting line up, too \u2013 one of four changes from Saturday. She has waited a long time for an opportunity and she took her chance to impress.\n\nJodie Taylor congratulates Beth Mead after her crucial goal against the Portuguese\n\nAt times during the first half, without seeming like I'm making excuses, England were unlucky. We looked most dangerous when we were playing one or two touch and little combination plays.\n\nBut sometimes when games are playing out like that and it's goalless at 60 minutes, it's good to get some fresh legs on. Players know they only have a limited time to make an impact and Jordan Nobbs and Jodie Taylor both had chances straight away.\n\nBeth Mead was there to pounce on the Portugal keeper's (Patricia Morais) error and tap the ball into the back of the net. I wouldn't mind if every goal went in off the back of the goalkeeper's head like that at the Olympics or the Euros if it means we're lifting a trophy at the end of the tournament. Nobody remembers those details anyway.\n\nArsenal striker Mead helped England Women stop a run of four defeats in five matches\n\nForward Taylor shapes up to shoot as she takes the ball past two Portugal players\n\nMy heart was in my mouth when Portugal were awarded a free kick in the last few minutes of the game. Claudia Neta probably thought she had snatched a late equaliser.\n\nPeople might say Ellie Roebuck's save was lucky because it came off her back. But as unorthodox as it looked, it's credit to the amount of detail she puts in. I've watched her learn from Karen Bardsley at Manchester City.\n\nBut this is a result that we need to build on now. It was important to stop the run of poor results before going into the game against Germany at Wembley in November. This win will give the team a much need boost in confidence.", "description": "JILL SCOTT: There will probably be an element of relief amongst the players, but overall we deserved to win the game, and I don't think anyone can argue about that.", "authors": ["Jill Scott For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19463446-0-image-a-6_1570571820534.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
