Small public lenders, public lenders that don\u2019t file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and private and nonprofit lenders will have to implement the credit-loss standard, known as CECL, for the fiscal year and interim periods beginning after Dec. 15, 2022.\n\nDuring the extended preparation period, the FASB intends to continue offering a series of workshops to educate smaller lenders across the U.S. on applying CECL, Chairman Russell Golden said.\n\n\u201cWhat we discovered in revenue recognition and leases is that smaller companies have the opportunity to learn from larger companies,\u201d Mr. Golden said in an interview.\n\nPrivate companies preparing for the transition in lease accounting, for example, have been watching how public companies have implemented the rule. Finance chiefs have said that many public companies underestimated the difficulties of complying with the rule.\n\nLarge public banks, which the FASB defines as all SEC-filing lenders minus small business entities, were unaffected and will have the same deadline of the fiscal year after Dec. 15, 2019.\n\nDelaying CECL for some lenders likely won\u2019t end the banking industry\u2019s criticisms of the standard. Banks have argued the need to book losses up front would discourage lending. Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives introduced bills in recent months to delay CECL and conduct a study on the standard\u2019s potential impact.\n\n\u201cWe remain deeply disappointed that FASB has yet to take the logical next step of pausing implementation for all companies until a rigorous quantitative impact study can be completed to assess its full effects,\u201d Rob Nichols, chief executive of the industry group American Bankers Association, said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the delayed implementation of the insurance standard will affect all insurers. SEC-filing insurers will have until the fiscal year after Dec. 15, 2021, while all other insurers will have until the fiscal year after Dec. 15, 2023.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "The accounting standard-setter on Wednesday approved its proposals for companies\u2014mostly private businesses and nonprofits\u2014that haven\u2019t yet had to implement new rules on lease and hedge accounting.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-117695/social", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
