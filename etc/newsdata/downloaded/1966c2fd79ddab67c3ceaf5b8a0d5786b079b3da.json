This couldn\u2019t be any more true for iPhone 5 owners right now.\n\nIf you\u2019re still using your 2012-era iPhone, it\u2019s going to turn into even more of a paperweight than it might already feel like come Sunday, November 3. Unless you download and install a critical update from Apple, you\u2019ll lose access to your iPhone\u2019s core functionality and, as we\u2019ll get to in a bit, you won\u2019t be able to update your iPhone the easy way anymore.\n\nAs Apple describes:\n\n\u201cStarting just before 12:00 a.m. UTC on November 3, 2019, iPhone 5 will require an iOS update to maintain accurate GPS location and to continue to use functions that rely on correct date and time including App Store, iCloud, email, and web browsing. This is due to the GPS time rollover issue that began affecting GPS-enabled products from other manufacturers on April 6, 2019. Affected Apple devices are not impacted until just before 12:00 a.m. UTC on November 3, 2019.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that updating your iPhone is easy right now. If you want to do it wirelessly, tap Settings > General > Software Update and grab the iOS 10.3.4 update\u2014assuming you don\u2019t already have it, which you can check via Settings > General > About.\n\nIf you\u2019re old-school, you can also physically connect your device to your Mac and update that way, either through iTunes (if you haven\u2019t jumped ship to macOS Catalina) or directly within Finder.\n\nNo matter how you update your iPhone, don\u2019t put off installing iOS 10.3.4. If you procrastinate, you\u2019ll lose the ability to perform an over-the-air update\u2014nor will you be able to back up your device to iCloud\u2014and you\u2019ll have to connect your iPhone to a Mac in order to make it functional again.", "description": "Even though you might not be able to update an ancient smartphone to the latest version of its operating system, you shouldn\u2019t assume your device won\u2019t have any critical updates for the rest of its life.
