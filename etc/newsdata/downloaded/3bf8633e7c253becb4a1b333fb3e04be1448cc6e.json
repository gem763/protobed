Meal hall is marvellous, but trust us when we say you're bound to miss breakfast sometimes on account of the snooze button, and you're destined to crave something salty or sweet during late-night work sessions. Easy-to-store, easy-to-pack healthy snacks are a must for maintaining a balanced diet and keeping your energy up.\n\nWe reached out to Zannat Reza, a registered dietitian at thrive360 to get some insight on what to avoid and what to stock up on, given the different snacking-scenarios you'll encounter this semester. She suggests students steer clear of certain common snack foods because they \"provide few nutrients and lots of extra calories\".\n\nHer list of no-no's includes culprits such as: chips, chocolate, sports drinks, fried foods, cakes and other baked goods, like cookies, doughnuts and store-bought muffins. Instead, Reza says to \"choose whole foods when possible, or buy things with the fewest ingredients because whole foods contain more nutrients than ultra-processed foods.\" She lists cheese, yogurt, nuts and roasted chickpeas as examples, as well as fruits and vegetables.\n\nOn-the-go mornings: You're going to want a little something to get you through that early morning lecture. No time to sit down for cereal? Reza suggests a smoothie, or a whole grain cereal that's easy to snack on sans-milk. Alternatively, oatmeal is a great option, too, she says. You can grab it at lots of coffee chains, but it's also easy to microwave and take with you, and you'll save cash that way too.\n\nWhen it comes to caffeine, coffee pods, or a space-saving espresso maker are simple solutions. A latt\u00e9 is Reza's recommended source because of the \"extra protein, calcium, and 13 other nutrients in [cow's] milk.\" As for milk alternatives, she advises opting for brands that contain added protein, since most varieties don't contain as much, naturally.\n\nMid-morning slump: It's quite possible you'll find yourself with a growling stomach halfway through a three-hour lecture on something called Neoplatonism. We speak from experience. Reza suggests packing something with protein for situations like this. She says a handful of nuts, pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds and an apple, or a protein bar, are her go-to's.\n\nLate night library sesh: As we've mentioned before, you'll be much more productive when you aren't sleep-deprived. But, we also know that sometimes, late-night cram sessions are unavoidable. To help you stay alert and focused, Reza suggests opting for similar snacks you'd reach for in a mid-morning slump. It's another situation you want to power through, and even though a bag of chips or a chocolate bar seem super-tempting, they have few nutrients \u2014 so opting for something with protein is your best bet.\n\nHeavy meals late at night might not be best either because they can disrupt your sleep as your body focuses its energy on digestion, says Reza. Brain-friendly foods for memory and concentration are also great for a study session. Her list includes: fatty fish like salmon (think of making a salmon sandwich, or mashed salmon on crackers), nuts, berries, leafy greens (such as kale chips), and eggs.\n\nPost-workout: Reza's go-to? A classic peanut butter sandwich made with whole grain bread. It's budget-friendly, delicious and protein-packed. She says almond butter is fine too, it just might be a little more pricey. With any nut butter, all-natural is best because there's no added sugar or salt. She also suggests a smoothie, a piece of fruit with cheese, avocado with a boiled egg, or veggie sticks with hummus.\n\nWhen the cravings kick in: If you're stress-snacking during midterms, or just in need of something sweet after a long day, we get it. It's all about moderation, after all. Just watch the amount of sugar in your chosen 'treat'. Be sure to check the ingredients list and the nutritional label. Opt for foods with \"less than 8 grams of sugar per serving,\" says Reza. This is a great rule of thumb for granola bars, which can contain high amounts of sugar.\n\nIf you're craving something savoury, she suggests an old-school fave \u2014 popcorn. She adds that plain popcorn is best, but a small amount of butter with a sprinkle of salt, or even Parmesan are fine, too.\n\nPerhaps you've got someone with a car who's helping you make the move to campus. Now is the perfect time to stock up on snacks and more. Here's a list of staples healthy pantry items to shop for, even if you have a meal plan. And while an econo-sized pack of Pop Tarts is absolutely tempting, we've got some healthier alts for your day-to-day snacking.\n\nHere are some of our go-to's:\n\nHigh in plant protein and fibre, these gently roasted chickpeas are a salty, savoury snack available in six different flavours and you can eat 'em by the handful when you're craving something with a crunch.\n\nThe Good Bean Original Salted Chickpeas, $4.97, Walmart\n\nSuggested by Reza, these bars are made with just 3 ingredients (dates, peanut butter and peanuts), contain 7 grams of protein and are great for late-night study sessions, or mid-morning slumps.\n\nLarabar Gluten Free Peanut Butter Fruit and Nut Energy Bar, 5 pack, $7.49, Amazon\n\nAs Reza says, cheese is a great snacking option.

And since they're individually wrapped, you can very easily grab and go.\n\nOld Cheddar Armstrong Snack, 10 pack, $4.97, No Frills\n\nThis one comes recommended by Reza as well. Yogurt is one of those versatile go-to's that's super easy, and contains plenty of protein. Throw some fresh fruit or cereal on top if you've them, or you can even grab one of these individual containers and head out to class.\n\nOikos Greek Yogurt, 4 pack, $2.79, Loblaws\n\nAs much as that strudel is screaming your name, it may not be the best breakfast.

Being mindful when consuming \u2014 not while you're distracted by Netflix \u2014 is recommended. Refraining from snacking straight from the container can also help manage portion size. And, importantly, snacks are best for when you're actually hungry, says the guide. They can be easy to reach for when you're stressed out, but as the site suggests, try not to snack just because you're tired, bored, or emotional.
