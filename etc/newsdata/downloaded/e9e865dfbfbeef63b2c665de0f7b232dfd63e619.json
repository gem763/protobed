From its inception in 2004, ACP has worked on the development of federal and state policies supporting the adjuster industry, ranging from adjuster licensing uniformity and reciprocity to eliminating burdensome state legislative or regulatory policies that would impede the prompt and equitable reimbursement of claims to Americans across the country.\n\nFederal Policy Agenda: ACP has worked with the Congress to introduce bipartisan legislation addressing inconsistencies and inefficiencies within the claims industry. The legislation would incentivize those states that license independent claims adjusters to adopt uniform and reciprocal licensing laws. Known as the Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters (CLAIM) Act (H.R. 4037), the legislation gives states four years to adopt uniform and reciprocal adjuster licensing laws. The bill also expedites the claims process for disaster victims. The legislation will also ensure that active duty service members have their licenses automatically renewed, and that they do not risk losing their licenses while serving their country. The bill also now addresses the needs of rural Americans, and particularly America\u2019s family farms, by streamlining the process for crop adjusters to work across state lines.\n\nState Policy Agenda: ACP has been active for several years at the state level in advocating for independent claims professionals. The association currently maintains state campaigns in California, New York, and Texas, working to ensure the regulatory environment benefits adjusters and the consumers they serve in times of loss or disaster.\n\nAssociation Membership: ACP is a membership organization comprised of organizations that employ and contract with independent claims professionals. ACP companies respond every day to individuals and businesses who suffer a loss such as a workplace injury, property or casualty damage, or liability. Insurance carriers and self-insured companies retain our member companies for expert advice and knowledge throughout the claims management cycle. ACP companies provide a full range of claims services from claims adjusting to comprehensive claims management.\n\nOrganizational Structure: ACP is a virtual organization comprised of staff consultants who are experts in their policy, public relations, and membership management fields.\n\nFor more information on ACP, visit www. https://claimsprofession.org.
