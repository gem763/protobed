But its the CEOs that reap the biggest benefits in most cases.\n\nAnd if there's one sector where most companies are doing spectacularly right now, that's the tech industry.\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk is at the top of this list, and not because of that company either but rather because of Tesla. He's pulled a total compensation of $513 million last year, despite Tesla reporting a $1 billion loss. Though he's paid minimum wage as mandated by law, his actual gains come from massive stock options tied to performance goals.\n\nAs far as tech company CEOs go, Tim Cool is way up on the totem pole. In 2018 Apple gave him 280,000 time-based and 280,000 performance-based vested restricted stock worth $126 million all-told. And that was on top of a base salary of $3 million, cash bonus of $12 million, and perks worth $682,000.\n\nDon't Miss 1.2 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 661 SHARES 4.5 K SHARES\n\n3. Nikesh Arora - Palo Alto Networks - $130.7 million\n\nNikesh Arora has been CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks since June 2018. And despite his lack of experience in the field he makes a significant amount of money. Arora received a $19 million in restricted stock as a sign-on award, as well as stock awards and options worth $39.3 million and $72 million respectively.\n\n4. Mark Hurd - Oracle - $108.29 million\n\nLast year, Oracle CEO Mark Hurd had a respectable base salary of $950,000. However, he was also getting stock options of $103.7 million, as well as perks of $32,470 and a bonus of $3.7 million. He wasn't the only one with a big paycheck either, with the top four highest paid executives at the company (including him) totaling a compensation of $400 million between them.\n\nSatya Nadella first joined Microsoft in February 2014, and he's managed to turn the company right around in the time since. He's successfully managed to shift Microsoft away from being an OS company to an online services provider. And for his troubles he just received a 66 percent hike, taking his total compensation up to $42.9 million.\n\n6. Daniel Schulman PayPal - $38.8 million\n\nToday, Daniel Schulman makes $38.8 million as head of PayPal. But his first paycheck in 1981 was for a paltry $208. It was only after 18 years spent working his way up the ladder at AT&T that he's reached where he is now.\n\n7. Mike Lawrie - DXC Technology - $32.2 million\n\nDXC Technology has done fairly well for itself, providing IT services in the enterprise market. As CEO, Mike Lawrie pulls in about $32.2 million a year. But the average annual salary of DXC Tech employees in India? Just a little over $10,000 a year.\n\n8. Shantanu Narayen - Adobe - $28.4 million\n\nAdobe owes much of its recent success to Shantanu Narayen, who took the company away from desktop software and towards the cloud. He's also been ranked among the world's top CEOs by Glassdoor, which might be why he pulls in $28.4 million each year.\n\n9. Marc Benioff - Salesforce - $28.4 million\n\nMarc Benioff isn't just the CEO and founder of cloud computing company Salesforce, but he's also made himself known as a capable angel investor over the years.\n\n10. Chuck Robbins - Cisco - $21.3 million\n\nChuck Robbins has been at Cisco since he joined way back in 1997, before being named CEO in 2015. He now pulls in $21.3 million each year.\n\n11. Ajay Banga - Mastercard - $20.4 million\n\nOne of the few Indians on this list, Ajaypal Singh Banga has been CEO of Mastercard. He's even previously served as a member of the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations under Barack Obama.", "description": "When companies do well, employees can hope to receive bonuses and salary hikes.
