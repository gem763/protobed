Try visiting a county fair in Trump Country", "language": "en", "text": "Anyone interested in venturing outside the \u201cTrump in Constant Crisis\u201d universe to observe how others view the president doesn\u2019t need to book a seat on Virgin Galactic or SpaceX for a journey into space. Just spend a few days at an agricultural fair. There are more than 3,000 held annually across the nation.\n\nIn rural settings where homes are separated by acres of soybeans and corn rather than blocks of concrete and asphalt, farm duties often confine residents to barnyards and fields through much of the year, except for trips to the grocery store, school events or church. For these residents, events such as the Highland County Fair \u2014 held the first week of September on about 100 sprawling acres on the edge of Hillsboro \u2014 represent a much-anticipated annual excursion. As one fair official said this year, \u201cThe fair is like a social event. Sometimes people don\u2019t see other people they know the whole year, so they come to the fair to see them.\u201d\n\nThere were carnival rides for the kids, along with tractor pulls, demolition derbies, a rodeo, \u201cBarnyard Olympics\u201d (muddy obstacle courses, tire-rolling contests) and cheerleader competitions. A queen was crowned and an amateur talent show held, the winner being a performer of country music, naturally. Art, culinary, floral and craft displays drew hundreds of entries, all vying for coveted blue ribbons. But mostly, the fair is a celebration of farming and, as always, youngsters proudly displayed the cattle, swine, goats, poultry and other animals they raised.", "description": "", "authors": ["Gary Abernathy", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Think-You-Have-The-President-On-The-Ropes-Try-Visiting-A-County-Fair-In-Trump-Country"], "top_image": ""}
