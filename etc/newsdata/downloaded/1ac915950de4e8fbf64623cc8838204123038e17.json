Thankfully, this weekend's storm will be metaphorical, not literal.\n\nThere was thunder, too, late Friday night but the loudest bang will be the sound of the eight best rugby nations in the world - and not all tier one, pleasingly - colliding in Japan.\n\nAt England's camp in the steep hills that surround Beppu, Billy Vunipola was working hard at trying to keep a lid on it.\n\nMako (left) will join Billy Vunipola for the first time since February 10's 44-8 win over France\n\nReceived wisdom says that Billy plays better when his big brother Mako is on the field\n\nThere had been no problem in that sense through the week, still calm, still unemotional. By Friday, the nerves were jangling a bit. Come Saturday, he didn't know.\n\nAustralia are by some distance the most significant opponents England will have met since arriving here, the first to harbour genuine ambitions of winning the tournament.\n\nYet they have already lost to Wales and no World Cup-winner has ever experienced defeat on their run to the final.\n\nEngland are strong favourites and, if successful, will in all likelihood meet the All Blacks next week. A step up again. So the challenge is to throw it all into beating Australia without losing their minds, as happened to England at the last World Cup.\n\nIt was Australia who sent them tumbling out of that competition, the only hosts to exit at the pool stage in World Cup history.\n\nVunipola reflected on this. 'I don't want to get too worked up, too pumped,' he said. 'I don't want to detract from the team or hinder us by trying to do too much.\n\n'There will be nerves and when you have those nerves it probably focuses the mind a little bit more. But I think everyone is trying to build it into something it's not. We still want to be getting better as a team and that probably shows where we're at.\n\n'We probably haven't played to the level we can do, but we did that in the Six Nations and then we lost in Wales, so we have to keep building to take care of our business. The pressure that lies within this game is bigger than any other we have played.\n\n'It feels right that we are here. We have had success and we know what success feels like, which we didn't in 2015. But we have also had some tough times, losing five in a row, and those have needed to be brutally honest times, too - which we also never had before as a team. We have talked about being together and all these cliched slogans that get put about. The most humble way I can put it is that we are going all right as a group.'\n\nIt's a high pressure clash, as England take on Australia in the World Cup quarter-final\n\nFor all the controversy that has surrounded England coach Eddie Jones' changes, one development that has brought only acclaim is the re-acquaintance of the Vunipola brothers in an England starting line-up. Prop Mako will join Billy for the first time since February 10 and a 44-8 win over France at Twickenham.\n\nIt is widely recognised that they seem to bring the best out of each other, particularly the younger brother. Jones had hoped the return from injury of Mako for the match with France last week would have sparked stronger performances from Billy at this World Cup. By his own admission, Billy hasn't been making the hard carries, the hard yards. The plan was delayed a week, but the faith in this fraternal strategy remains.\n\n'You see it with brothers,' said Jones. 'There is something about families that distinguishes them from just being friends and I think that carries a lot of weight.\n\n'Mako, at his best, is probably the best loose-head in the world, but he also brings calmness.\n\n'If you've got two brothers, one's always a bit more volatile, the other is a bit more settled. So in the car growing up, Mako was always up at the front with the parents and Billy was probably at the back, screaming.\n\n'But he's great for us because he has got that fire and temperament and you want that from your No 8. You look at the history of the World Cups and they've always been won by big No 8s.'\n\nIs there any other kind these days?\n\nYet even big No 8s need protection sometimes and that is what Billy gets from Mako.\n\nThey may not live in each other's pockets off the field, but they have got each other's backs on it.\n\n'It is definitely a thing that I'm better with Mako around,' Billy confirmed. 'It's not something we think about, but having him there gives me a little more time. He takes away tension because he is as much of a threat. It's definitely a compliment the attention I get in some matches, but I also think it is different when it comes to these big games.\n\n'We have a lot more threats, so that diverts from me and hopefully I can get going.\n\n'We've got Kyle Sinckler and Jamie George but I think Mako goes really well in that capacity off the No 9, and that helps to give me space and timing in the next carry.\n\n'He takes a lot of pressure off me because he's the older brother, so anything that comes towards the Vunipolas, he usually takes the brunt of it and I'm always in the background just kicking back, as younger brothers do.\n\n'I enjoy having him around, he's a bit like my shield. That's what big brothers do. Off the field we have a funny relationship.\n\n'I certainly don't spend more time with him than the other guys. We don't hang out, unless his little boy is here, my nephew. That is what brings us together.\n\n'Deep down, I think we really love each other, but he never says it to me,' said Billy\n\n'Deep down, I think we really love each other, but he never says it to me. I always say it to him, but he gets embarrassed and runs away. We just do our own jobs. We don't have to tell each other every other minute how much we care for each other, it's just there. He's family and I can't change that. We didn't play against each other much before we signed for the same clubs but, when we did, on the pitch it was hard. Easier in the garden, but in a proper game I'd do something to him and people would talk about it. That was difficult.\n\n'I didn't want to tackle him, it felt really weird. It was better once I was at Saracens like him.\n\n'That's probably how much it meant to me and my family, that I'd rather be with him than against him. We don't do that competitive thing with each other. Unless we are playing video games, and I beat him all the time.'\n\nSaturday's quarter-final, however, is no simulation. Do-or-die, Jones called it, and even his record of six straight wins against Australia with England should not be treated as a yardstick.\n\nYes, England are the better side. But if that alone dictated outcomes in knockout tournaments, the All Blacks would have considerably more than three World Cup titles.\n\nSo this could not be any more real for England, for Jones and for the Vunipola brothers.\n\nWhen the mist clears, they hope to be the only ones standing.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER IN OITA: A gently persistent mist descended on Oita on Friday, bringing an eerie calm before the storm.
