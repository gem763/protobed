While it may have been a result of several factors, my absent-minded blunder probably hindered my chances too. Or perhaps it was the first seven words I uttered.\n\nResearchers at Yale University found that interviewers often make assumptions based on class from the first few words said by candidates.\n\nThe results from five studies conducted by scientists found that employers not only make snap judgments, they then use it to assess the person\u2019s ability to carry out the job.\n\nAnd even worse news \u2013 interviewers are dismissing candidates from working-class backgrounds within the first few seconds of introduction.\n\nThe study, to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also showed that people can identify with \u2018above accuracy\u2019, a stranger\u2019s socioeconomic position from a brief speech pattern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese snap perceptions then influence hiring managers in ways that favour applicants from higher social classes.\n\nThe way you pronounce things may also hinder job prospects (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Our study shows that even during the briefest interactions, a person\u2019s speech patterns shape the way people perceive them, including assessing their competence and fitness for a job,\u2019 said Michael Kraus, a professor of organisational behaviour at Yale.\n\n\u2018While most hiring managers would deny that a job candidate\u2019s social class matters, in reality, the socioeconomic position of an applicant or their parents is being assessed within the first seconds they speak \u2014 a circumstance that limits economic mobility and perpetuates inequality.\u2019\n\nThe researchers based their findings on five separate studies. The first four examined the extent that people accurately perceive social class based on a few seconds of speech.\n\nThe fifth study examined how these speech cues influence hiring.\n\n'Friends tell me I'm not \"black enough\" but I won't change who I am'\n\nThere were 300 participants involved in the study, 20 of whom were \u2018prospective employees\u2019 and the rest \u2018hiring managers\u2019, recruiting for an entry-level lab manager position at Yale.\n\nHiring managers were asked to assess the candidates\u2019 professional qualities, starting salary, signing bonus, and perceived social class.\n\nTheir only material was the candidate\u2019s brief pre-interview discussion, either via an audiotape or by reading a transcript.\n\nThose who listened to the audio recordings were more likely to accurately assess socioeconomic status than those who read transcripts, according to the study.\n\nThe research showed that pronunciation in an individual\u2019s speech made it easier to judge an applicant\u2019s social status more accurately than the content of their speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Kraus concluded that employers must be cognizant of these unconscious biases.\n\n\u2018If we want to move to a more equitable society, then we must contend with these ingrained psychological processes that drive our early impressions of others.\n\n\u2018Despite what these hiring tendencies may suggest, talent is not found solely among those born to rich or well-educated families.\n\n\u2018Policies that actively recruit candidates from all levels of status in society are best positioned to match opportunities to the people best suited for them.\u2019\n\nMORE: It\u2019s not just racism that workplaces must break down, it\u2019s unconscious bias\n\nMORE: What is unconscious name bias and why is it so damaging?\n\nMORE: Couple hide baby\u2019s gender to protect them from \u2018unconscious bias\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Researchers at Yale University found that interviewers often make assumptions based on class from the first few words said by candidates.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1097271132_1571816478.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
