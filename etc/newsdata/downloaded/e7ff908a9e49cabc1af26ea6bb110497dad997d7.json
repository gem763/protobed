The country presented by President Donald Trump is roaring and ascendant , shattering all economic records for performance.\n\nThe reality, of course, is more complex.\n\nAfter three turns on the debate stage by the Democratic candidates, it\u2019s become clear that for the most part they hew to actual statistics and other fundamentals more closely than does Trump, who routinely says false things and repeats them as if willing them into being.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the Democrats are beacons of accuracy. Some will use older statistics when newer ones don\u2019t suit their argument or give a selective reading of history when that fits the story they want to tell. Sometimes what they don\u2019t say speaks loudly, as when they won\u2019t acknowledge the cost of their plans or the likely tax hit on average people.\n\nA sampling:\n\nECONOMY AND TRADE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAll time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women.\u201d - tweet Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The unemployment rate for women has not reached an \u201call time best\u201d during the Trump administration.\n\nIt did fall to 3.1% in April, the lowest since October 1953. But that is still far higher than the record set in May 1953 of 2.4%.\n\nIt\u2019s a fact that Trump has acknowledged, having repeatedly joked at campaign rallies this year how he\u2019s fallen short on the women\u2019s unemployment rate. \u201cI always say kiddingly, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make it historic\u2019 but you know what, it\u2019s going to be historic very soon,\u201d he said last week in North Carolina.\n\nSince April, the unemployment rate for women has actually ticked higher to 3.3%.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cHow do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country?\u201d - tweet Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: \u201cPerhaps\u201d is a rare bit of modesty in this frequent boast by Trump but he is still wrong in claiming the U.S. has its best economy ever.\n\nIn the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 - the same pace it reached in 2015 under President Barack Obama - and hasn\u2019t hit historically high growth rates.\n\nThe unemployment rate is near a 50-year low of 3.7%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the 1990s. More Americans are now out of the workforce, taking care of children or relatives, or going to school, while others became discouraged about their job prospects and stopped looking. The government doesn\u2019t count people as unemployed unless they are actively searching for jobs. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on China\u2019s economy. \u201cBy the way, China is having the worst year they\u2019ve had now in 57 years, OK? Fifty-seven.\u201d - remarks Wednesday in meeting on e-cigarettes.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThey\u2019ve had now the worst year in 57 years.\u201d - North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s not true. China is far from the impoverished disaster of a half century ago, when it was reeling from the massive famine caused by Mao Zedong\u2019s radical economic policies and heading into the chaos of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.\n\nChina\u2019s economy is indeed slowing from Trump\u2019s taxes on Chinese imports, as well as its own campaign to constrain runaway debt. The International Monetary Fund expects the Chinese economy to grow 6.2% this year. That\u2019s the slowest growth for China in nearly 30 years. But it\u2019s still markedly faster than U.S. growth.\n\nSince overhauling its economy in the late 1970s, China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, established a growing middle class and surpassed Japan to become the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cHundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost.\u201d - remarks at North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.\n\nTHE FACTS: Americans are also eating the cost.\n\nAs he escalates a trade war with China, Trump refuses to recognize that tariffs are mainly, if not entirely, paid by companies and consumers in the country that imposes them.\n\nIn a study in May, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with Princeton and Columbia universities, estimated that tariffs from Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China were costing $831 per U.S. household on an annual basis, before tariffs were recently escalated. Analysts also found that the burden of Trump\u2019s tariffs falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imported products.\n\nA report last month by JPMorgan Chase estimated that tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 per year if tariffs on an additional $300 billion of U.S. imports from China proceed in September and December. Trump has since bumped up the scheduled levies even higher, probably adding to the U.S. burden.\n\n___\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: \u201cWe have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth.\u201d - Democratic debate.\n\nTHE FACTS: This oft-repeated line by the Vermont senator is an exaggeration.\n\nThere are nearly 200 countries in the world, many with people living in extreme poverty that most Americans would struggle to fathom. Poverty is also a relative measure in which someone who is poor in one nation might look rather prosperous in another.\n\nBut the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development updated its child poverty report in 2018. The United States had an above average level of child poverty, but it was not at the bottom of the 42 nations listed in the report. The United States still fared better than Russia, Chile, Spain, India, Turkey, Israel, Costa Rica, Brazil, South Africa and China.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.\u201d - North Carolina rally.\n\nTHE FACTS: His tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in U.S. history.\n\nIt\u2019s a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. As a share of the total economy, a tax cut of that size ranks 12th, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 cut is the biggest, followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II.\n\nPost-Reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant: President George W. Bush\u2019s cuts in the early 2000s and Obama\u2019s renewal of them a decade later.\n\n___\n\nGUNS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cDemocrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans so they\u2019re totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house with a gun.\u201d - remarks Thursday to House Republicans in Baltimore.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s a vast overstatement. No Democratic candidates have proposed stripping all guns from Americans. One of the top 10 candidates, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, has proposed confiscating assault-type weapons such as the AK-47 through a mandatory buyback program.\n\n___\n\nMIGRANTS\n\nJOE BIDEN, on the treatment of migrants in his time as Obama\u2019s vice president: \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages.\u201d - Democratic presidential debate Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Yes, they did.\n\nThe \u201ccages\u201d - chain-link enclosures inside border facilities where migrants have been temporarily housed, separated by sex and age - were built and used by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has been using the same facilities.\n\nDemocrats routinely accuse Trump of using cages for migrant children without acknowledging the same enclosures were employed when Biden was vice president.\n\n___\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: \u201cEvery study done shows that \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman and child in this country.\u201d - Democratic debate.\n\nTHE FACTS: No, not every study.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this year that total spending under a single-payer system, such as the one proposed by Sanders, \u201cmight be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system.\u201d\n\nThose features involve details about payment rates for hospitals and doctors, which are not fully spelled out by Sanders, as well as the estimated cost of generous benefits that include long-term care services and no copays and deductibles for comprehensive medical care.\n\nA report this year by the Rand think tank estimated that Medicare for All would modestly raise national health spending, the opposite of what the Vermont senator intends.\n\nRand modeled a hypothetical scenario in which a plan similar to legislation by the Vermont senator had taken effect this year. It found that total U.S. health care spending would be about $3.9 trillion under Medicare for All in 2019, compared with about $3.8 trillion under the status quo.\n\nPart of the reason is that Medicare for All would offer generous benefits with no copays and deductibles, except limited cost-sharing for certain medications. Virtually free comprehensive medical care would lead to big increases in the demand for services.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cOur ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years.\u201d - North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s exaggerating his influence on drug prices, which haven\u2019t fallen for brand-name drugs, the area that worries consumers the most.\n\nMost of his administration\u2019s \u201cambitious campaign\u201d to reduce drug prices has yet to be completed. Major regulations are in the works and legislation has yet to be passed by Congress. A rule requiring drugmakers to disclose prices in TV ads has been blocked for now by the courts.\n\nHarsh criticism of the industry - from Trump and lawmakers of both parties in Congress - may be having some effect, however.\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s inflation index for prescription drug prices has declined in seven of the past eight months, which is highly unusual. That index includes lower-cost generic drugs, which account for 90% of prescriptions filled in the U.S. Prices for generics have been declining under pressure from big drug distributors.\n\nFor brand-name drugs, though, a recent analysis by The Associated Press shows that on average prices are still going up, but at a slower pace. The cost of brand-name drugs is what\u2019s most concerning to consumers, with insured patients facing steep copays for some medications.\n\nThe AP analysis found that in the first seven months of 2019, drugmakers raised list prices for brand-name medicines by a median, or midpoint, of 5%.\n\nThat does reflect a slowing in price increases. They were going up 9% or 10% over those months the prior four years. But it\u2019s not a decrease in actual prices. There were 37 price increases for every decrease in the first seven months of 2019. Pricing data for the AP analysis came from the health information firm Elsevier.\n\n___\n\nELIZABETH WARREN, asked whether her health plan would mean higher middle-class taxes: \u201cWe pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle-class families are going to pay less. That\u2019s how this is going to work. \u2026 Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s a dodge.\n\nThe senator from Massachusetts did not answer back-to-back questions about whether middle class taxes would go up from her version of Medicare for All.\n\nIt\u2019s a given that consumers will pay less for health care if the government picks up the bills. But Sanders is almost alone among the candidates who support Medicare for All in acknowledging that broadly higher taxes would be needed to pay for that universal coverage. He would consider, and probably not be able to avoid, a tax increase on the middle class in exchange for health care without copayments, deductibles and the like. \u201cYes, they will pay more in taxes but less in health care,\u201d he said in a June debate.\n\nSome rivals, including Warren, have only spoken about taxing the wealthy and \u201cWall Street.\u201d Analysts say that\u2019s not going to cover the costs of government-financed universal care.\n\n___\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe passed something they wanted to do for half a century: We passed VA Choice.\u201d - North Carolina rally.\n\nTHE FACTS: It was Obama who won passage of the Veterans Choice program, which gives veterans the option to see private doctors outside the VA medical system at government expense. Congress approved the program in 2014, and Obama signed it into law. Trump expanded it.\n\n___\n\nEL PASO\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE, former U.S. representative from Texas, on last month\u2019s mass shooting in El Paso: \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve learned about resilience, I\u2019ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas, in the face of this act of terror, that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of United States. It killed 22 people, and injured many more, we were not defeated by that. Nor were we defined by that.\u201d - Democratic debate.\n\nTHE FACTS: Nobody has claimed that Trump \u201cdirected\u201d the shooting. Earlier in the debate, O\u2019Rourke had said the shooter was \u201cinspired to kill by our president.\u201d It is hard to know for sure what led the gunman to open fire inside a Walmart in El Paso, killing 22 people. The suspect posted a manifesto online before the shooting that echoed Trump\u2019s comments on immigration. Yet the suspect said his own views \u201cpredate Trump and his campaign for president.\u201d\n\nThe screed spoke of what the suspect called a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas,\u201d railed against immigrants and warned of an imminent attack. Nearly all of the victims had Latino last names.\n\nThe suspect purchased the gun legally, according to El Paso\u2019s police chief.\n\n___\n\nRUSSIA INVESTIGATION\n\nKAMALA HARRIS, on Trump: \u201cThe only reason he has not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.\u201d - Democratic debate.\n\nTHE FACTS: We don\u2019t know that it\u2019s the only reason. Former special counsel Robert Mueller didn\u2019t go that far in his report on Russian intervention in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice.\n\nHarris, a California senator, is referring to a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents are immune from indictment. Mueller has said his investigators were restrained by that rule, but he also said that they never reached a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.\n\nIn Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony in July, he said his team never started the process of evaluating whether to charge Trump.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak, Christopher Rugaber, Colleen Long, Michael Balsamo, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington and Amanda Seitz in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The country described by the Democrats running for president is mired in child poverty, riven with economic unfairness and broken in its approach to health care, crime and guns.
