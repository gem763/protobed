The medication is permitted by the UFC's anti-doping partner USADA within a certain amount.\n\nBut fighters should not take more than 1600 micrograms within a 24 hour period or 800 micrograms within a 12 hour period - although inhalers cannot be used during a bout.\n\nHe takes a puff on his inhaler while sitting on his stool in between rounds during the bout\n\nFootage of the inhaler usage that led to Greg Hardy's win being overturned and declared a No Contest #UFCBoston pic.twitter.com/qmZ8KtXyVO \u2014 ESPN MMA (@espnmma) October 19, 2019\n\nHowever, Hardy claims he did receive permission to use the inhaler, saying he is 'still a new guy in this sport' after switching from American Football in 2016.\n\n'I was in the ring, me and my coach asked the commission if it would be OK to use my inhaler and they said yes, so I took it,' he said.\n\n'I'm still (a) new guy in this sport. I did what I do in every situation \u2014 I asked permission, I got permission and I did what I was told.'\n\nHardy outfought his opponent in the three-round fight, but will now have the win quashed\n\nThe referee lifts Hardy's arm aloft as he is declared the winner after the heavweight contest\n\nMeanwhile, UFC president Dana White has admitted he was left dumbfounded by Hardy and his trainer Din Thomas for their decision to use the Inhaler.\n\n'It was crazy. So everybody started screaming at me, \"He used an inhaler! He used an inhaler!\" I couldn't even grasp it, like \"What do you mean he used an inhaler?\".\n\n'I don\u2019t even know what to say. First of all, Din Thomas. I mean come on Din, you\u2019ve been in this game forever. You know what I mean?'\n\nHardy featured for the Caroline Panthers and the Dallas Cowboys between 2010 and 2014, before making his UFC bow in November 2017 - knocking out Joe Hawkins in just over 30 seconds.", "description": "The heavyweight had seen off the challenge of Sosoli in three rounds after he was taken the distance for the first time in his career, but he will have the win chalked off after he was seen using an inhaler.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/12/19921498-0-image-a-48_1571486357412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
