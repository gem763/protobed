Should Wales defeat South Africa in the other semifinal, Welshman Owens would likely be precluded from officiating in the final.\n\nFrench referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s will take charge of Sunday's semifinal between South Africa and Wales, with England's Wayne Barnes and New Zealander Ben O'Keeffe as touchline officials and New Zealander Ben Skeen as TMO. Garc\u00e8s handled the England-Australia quarterfinal on Saturday.\n\n\"These are the best of the best, supported by a superb team, and we now look forward to compelling semifinals,\" World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
