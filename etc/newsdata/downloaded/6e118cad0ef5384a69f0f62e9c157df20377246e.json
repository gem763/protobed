When we covered that \u2014yes, this is news, so we've saved you a fussy tweet, Brendan\u2014we said that all Yandy needed was a Sexy Popeye's Chicken Sandwich\u2026 and you know exactly where this is going, right?\n\nOn Thursday, Yandy released a $79.95 'Sold Out Chicken Sandwich' costume, because of course they did. The high- and low-cut velour bodysuit has been printed with what is supposed to be a piece of Popeyes chicken, embellished with two ruffled pickles, and stamped with the words SOLD OUT because girl, did you ever.\n\n\"Winner, winner chicken dinner\u2026 or so you thought. A few too many fast food lovers fantasized about this five star fried feast,\" the costume's description reads. \"Is it due to that unbelievable batter or maybe its drool-worthy bun? Either way, these seasoned breasts will be back on full display in no time.\" (This is honestly no worse than anything E.L. James ever wrote.)\n\nAccording to Yandy, potential customers actually reached out to the company to ask if they'd be turning that unnamed chicken sandwich into something wearable. \"We were already in the midst of updating our top sexy food costumes for 2019 when the infamous chicken sandwich war happened,\" Alicia Thompson, Yandy's Director of Brand Marketing told VICE in an email.\n\nShe credited Pilar Quintana Williams, the company's vice president of merchandising, with bringing the concept to life. \"She set to work designing a version that would speak to the Yandy aesthetic and current fashion trends in a bodysuit silhouette,\" Thompson said. \"The pickle peplum and sleeve puffs had to be just right.\n\nAs of this writing, the costume has only been available for a half-day, so the company did not have any sales numbers available. If the \"Yandy aesthetic\" speaks to you, and you're OK with encasing your labia in hastily assembled velour, then you know where to find this.\n\nOK Yandy, we're gonna try this again: The only thing your website doesn't offer is a Sexy Arthur Fleck costume. Do it, we dare you.", "description": "After the sexy White Claw costume debuted, we joked that all the world needed was a sexy Popeyes sandwich costume.
