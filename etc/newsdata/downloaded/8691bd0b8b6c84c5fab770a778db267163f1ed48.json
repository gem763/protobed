During the visit, Lebron and his wife posed for a smiling picture with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nLebron is one of the internet\u2019s leading promoters of QAnon, the pro-Trump conspiracy theory based on a series of anonymous clues posted to internet forums. QAnon believers have interpreted the clues, which they claim without evidence are coming from a highly placed source in the Trump administration, to mean that Trump and the military are engaged in a high-stakes shadow war against a supposed globalist pedophile cult. The conspiracy theory has caught on with Trump supporters, who have held up QAnon-related signs and wear QAnon shirts to the president\u2019s rallies.\n\nLebron claimed to have received a \u201cspecial guided tour of the White House\u201d before posing for pictures with Trump. In a video posted Friday, Lebron said he didn\u2019t use the brief encounter with the president to ask Trump about QAnon or its slogan, \u201cWhere we go one, we go all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all know he knows about it,\u201d Lebron said in the video, sipping from a coffee mug he claimed to have received as a gift at the White House.\n\nLebron didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment as of press time. Neither did White House spokespeople.\n\nAll four White House officials the Beast did speak with about how Trump, the leader of the free world, ended up in a smiling photo op at the Resolute Desk with a prominent QAnon conspiracy theorist, pleaded ignorance about when this occurred, and why. Two of these West Wing officials audibly could not contain their laughter.\n\n\u201cThis president is a president for all Americans,\u201d one joked, including conspiracy theorists.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Lebron and his spouse were simply able to casually stumble into this meeting while on a White House tour, for instance. Those familiar with how this Oval Office operates say that typically the only way that an Oval photo op between President Trump and strangers would even happen is if a senior official vouched for the guests and waved them in.\n\nLebron, for his part, tweeted a picture of himself in the White House with QAnon-related hashtags. His visit to the White House comes as other prominent Trump supporters in the media try to push back on QAnon\u2019s spread, fearing that it makes Trump voters look ridiculous.", "description": "Lionel Lebron said he got a personal invite to the White House\u2014and took advantage to post photos and Q clues on social media.", "authors": ["Will Sommer", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1535148468/180824-sommer-trump-office-hero_piuenq", "published_at": "2018-08-24"}
