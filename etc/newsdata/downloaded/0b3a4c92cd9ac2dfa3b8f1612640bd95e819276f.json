He loved it so much that SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, which launched in January 2018, included a copy of each of the books in the trilogy.\n\nThe books tells the story of an intergalactic empire that falls to pieces, with a dark age waiting on the other side.\n\n\"Foundation\" is a \"futuristic version of Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,'\" he told the Guardian, referencing the famous history that followed Rome from its breathtaking heights to the fall of Byzantium.\n\nFrom \"Foundation,\" Musk learned that every civilization \u2014 including our own \u2014 will one day falter.\n\n\"The lessons of history would suggest that civilizations move in cycles,\" Musk told the Guardian. \"You can track that back quite far \u2014 the Babylonians, the Sumerians, followed by the Egyptians, the Romans, China. We're obviously in a very upward cycle right now, and hopefully that remains the case. But it may not. There could be some series of events that cause that technology level to decline.\"\n\nAnd when that happens in our case \u2014 when humanity hits its own dark age \u2014 what's the best thing we can do to make sure it's as short as possible?\n\nBy having the human race become, to use Musk's favored terminology, interplanetary.\n\nThus the need for SpaceX, the privatized space exploration company that Musk started back when only nation-states were trying to launch rockets out of Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\"Given that this is the first time in 4.5 billion years where it's been possible for humanity to extend life beyond Earth,\" he said, \"it seems like we'd be wise to act while the window was open and not count on the fact it will be open a long time.\"", "description": "The SpaceX founder loves the Isaac Asimov books so much, he launched copies of them into orbit aboard a rocket in 2018.", "authors": ["Drake Baer", "Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cf548d011e2050f05249cf6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
