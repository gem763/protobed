This, the USA held, meant it was effectively subsidising Chinese exporters through artificially low delivery costs, while undermining private parcel delivery services that could not compete with below-cost prices.\n\nFixing that would be simple if all countries simply \"self-declared\" their rates, effectively allowing any country to determine how much it charges others for delivery mail, the USA said. But that path, known as \"Option B\" was rejected by a relatively narrow margin.\n\nInstead delegates from around 150 countries agreed on \"Option V\". This now allows the United States to start self-declaring its rates from next year, in return for a reported $40 million a year payment to the running costs of the UTU. Other countries will start to self-declare rates from 2021, with phased increases in termination payments overall over the course of the next five years.\n\nThat opens the door to complicated manoeuvring between major players in the global postal market \u2013 and a couple of smaller players. Higher terminal rates favour countries that deliver more foreign mail than they send; those countries will increasingly be able to charge fair rates for incoming mail without increasing the costs for their own senders through reciprocal increases by their peers.\n\nSouth Africa happens to be in just such position, with large quantities of mail sent to SA from Germany, China, Britain and the Netherlands, without much flowing the other way.\n\n\"An average monthly volume for this year was 1,202,000 items imported and 536,000 items exported,\" Sbu Xaba of the SA Post Office told Business Insider South Africa.\n\nJust what that means in rand and cent terms will become slowly apparent over the next several years through further negotiation, but the impact is likely to be positive for South Africa every step of the way, just as long as South Africans don't turn into senders rather than recipients of mail.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "International rule changes forced through by America promise to make the SAPO's life a little easier in coming years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9296/5929c7411e3847b4bd4a72d23cc2acac.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
