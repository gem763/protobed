Mulvaney seemed to indicate that the two were connected, but now he claims it was a misunderstanding.\n\nTRUMP SCRAPS PLANS TO HOST 2020 G-7 SUMMIT AT DORAL RESORT AMID DEM UPROAR\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people are saying that I said, but I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Mulvaney claimed on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d insisting that his words were taken the wrong way. Mulvaney acknowledged that President Trump had mentioned concern regarding Ukraine and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s hacked server, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t connected to the aid.\u201d\n\nThe confusion over whether or not Mulvaney had admitted to a quid pro quo stemmed from an exchange with ABC News reporter Jon Karl. Karl asked if the investigation of Ukraine\u2019s possible ties to Democrats during the 2016 election was connected to the withholding of the money, stating that this would be a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney said. He later issued a statement saying that \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThe investigation request was part of a phone call between the two world leaders, but both Trump and Zelensky have insisted there was no pressure involved. The call was the basis for an anonymous whistleblower complaint that has become the basis for an impeachment investigation that has included several closed-door interviews with officials related to U.S.-Ukraine relations. The complaint also alleged that Trump wanted Ukraine to help Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.\n\nSunday morning, Mulvaney claimed that the best proof that there was no quid pro quo is the fact that the Trump administration ended up turning over the money.\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL SAYS TRUMP'S SYRIA WITHDRAWAL IS A 'GRAVE' MISTAKE\n\n\u201cThe aid flowed,\u201d Mulvaney said, stating that the money went through once the Trump administration was satisfied with two things: Ukrainian efforts to control corruption in the country, and other nations\u2019 financial support for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOnce those two things were cleared, the money flowed,\u201d Mulvaney said. He also pointed to the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky that sparked interest in a possible quid pro quo, stating that nothing in the call connected the aid to the investigation.\n\n\u201cGo back to what actually happened in the real world,\" he said. \u201cGo back to the phone call.\u201d\n\nHost Chris Wallace pointed out that during the briefing, Mulvaney said there were three factors, not two, and that they were corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were paying, and whether or not there was help with the investigation.\n\nMulvaney said that it was all part of \"legitimate\" areas of interest.\n\n\u201cNo. 1, it is legitimate for the president to want to know what\u2019s going on with the ongoing investigation into the server \u2026 it is completely legitimate to ask about that. No. 2, it\u2019s legitimate to tie the aid to corruption, it\u2019s legitimate to tie the aid to foreign aid from other countries. That\u2019s what I was talking about with the three. Can I see how people took that the wrong way? Absolutely. But I never said there was a quid pro quo, because there isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMulvaney responded by focusing not on what he said, but \u201cthe facts on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo back to what actually happened in the real world,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cGo back to the phone call.\u201d\n\nAfter Mulvaney\u2019s Thursday briefing, a senior Department of Justice official said they had had no knowledge of any connection between the aid and any DOJ investigation.\n\n\u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,\u201d the official said.\n\nWallace asked Mulvaney if he ever considering resigning after Thursday\u2019s briefing.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said.\n\nMulvaney also touched on the controversy surrounding President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, which was followed by Turkish violence against Kurds in the region. The Trump administration negotiated terms for a 120-hour cease-fire, which both sides now accuse the other of violating.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublican leaders have spoken out against Trump's decision to withdraw from the region, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently calling it a \"grave\" mistake.\n\nMulvaney said Trump \"recognizes the fact that it's not politically popular in this town to make the decision that he made to move the troops out of Syria,\" but he promised to do it when he ran for president, and now he is doing it. Mulvaney downplayed any reduction in support for Trump among the GOP, pointing instead to what he said is an increase of support in swing states.", "description": "Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney insists he did not admit to wrongdoing by President Trump after comments he made during a marathon press briefing Thursday were interpreted as evidence there was a quid pro quo involving military aid to Ukraine and help with an investigation of potential Ukrainian involvement with Democrats during the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/20/694940094001_6096261162001_6096262437001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
