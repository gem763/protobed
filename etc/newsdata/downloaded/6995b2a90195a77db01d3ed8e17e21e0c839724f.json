On his first Old Trafford start, the 17-year-old earned United the points with a coolly struck winner.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r had said he was an expert finisher and here he proved it with an important first United goal, though it was significant that by the 73rd minute he was the only teenager left on the field. \u201cIf you just get Mason in the box you know something is going to happen,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe might not play in the next game but he\u2019ll be important for us this season. He\u2019ll get his minutes.\u201d\n\nBukayo Saka inspires Arsenal to thrilling win at Eintracht Frankfurt Read more\n\nGreenwood became United\u2019s youngest ever European scorer, beating Marcus Rashford\u2019s record set in 2016. Yet with three inexperienced youngsters in the side and nine changes from the last starting lineup, United had failed up to that point to take a grip on the game, leading to the conclusion that the present crop of youth products may not be quite as ready as the manager had hoped.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r had stressed the importance of winning the home games in the group and, as the champions of Kazakhstan are probably the weakest side United will face, he will need to rethink his selection policy for future matches if he really wants to progress. It was notable that United were best served by old hands such as Nemanja Matic, Marcos Rojo and Rashford. The last is hardly old at 21, though he was a man among boys in this XI.\n\nUnited signalled their attacking intentions from the outset, with Fred hitting the bar with a thumping 30-yard drive after just three minutes. Remarkably the diminutive Brazilian was not the smallest home player on the pitch, thanks to Solskj\u00e6r giving a full debut to the even tinier Angel Gomes. United should have taken the lead 12 minutes in when the 19\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s corner rebounded invitingly off Axel Tuanzebe for Rashford, yet though the striker was onside and only a yard out, he found Nenad Eric in the Astana goal equal to his attempt to hook the ball over the line.\n\nRyan Christie penalty secures draw for Celtic at Rennes despite late red card Read more\n\nPhil Jones, making his first start of the season, was caught out midway through the first half when Roman Murtazayev turned him neatly and set off towards goal, only to produce the tamest of shots straight at Sergio Romero.\n\nAll the pre-match attention had been centred on Greenwood\u2019s elevation to the United front line but, though he did produce one shot narrowly off-target, it was Rashford who caused the visiting defence most problems, especially when running through static defenders to reach Rojo\u2019s lofted passes. The old man of the United attack should probably have done better when the left-back\u2019s first invitation found him clear in the area, but his touch let him down when attempting to control the ball. The next time Rashford opted for a first-time volley, only to be denied again by Eric\u2019s reactions on the line.\n\nEven such a callow United side were clearly superior to their Kazakh opponents \u2013 Astana found it increasingly difficult to cross the halfway line \u2013 yet the longer the game remained scoreless the more hesitant and laboured the home side appeared. For all their pressure they could count themselves lucky that Murtazayev is such a poor finisher, for after another Jones mistake had left Marin Tomasov in possession on halfway the Astana forward was given another shooting chance and again put a weak shot far too close to Romero.\n\nWolves make poor start to group stage as Braga exploit sloppy defending Read more\n\nRashford had another close-range chance at the end of the first half, again from Rojo, but this time via a deflection, when to the disappointment of the group of home fans in the \u201caway\u201d seats who kept up a barrage of noise throughout the game, he shot straight into the arms of the goalkeeper.\n\nGomes almost created a goal at the start of the second half when he enabled Rojo to send a low cross right along the goalline, one that both Greenwood and Tahith Chong failed to reach for a tap-in at the far post. When Fred forced a save with a free-kick after an hour it seemed to illustrate United\u2019s dearth of attacking options and Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard were sent on shortly afterwards.\n\nBoth were tangentially involved in the buildup to the breakthrough goal, though it would be unfair to deny Greenwood the credit he deserves for dragging Dorin Rotariu the wrong way and applying a confident finish from an unpromising angle.", "description": "Manchester United laboured to victory against their Kazakh opponents but the teenager\u2019s first senior goal rescued them from a goalless draw", "authors": ["Paul Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbd5f4ddb8398d0b09df3b6a82d95057f3b1904/0_0_3364_2019/master/3364.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=76389e1e3f6cc88aed53e66220bebd02", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
