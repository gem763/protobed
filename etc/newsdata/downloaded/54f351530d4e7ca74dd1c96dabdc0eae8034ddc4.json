Quintana, the 2016 champion, was in red going into the stage but had to drag himself over the line, losing three minutes six seconds on Roglic.\n\nThe Slovenian hit the first checkpoint of 11.9km 21 seconds quicker than the previous fastest time, set by compatriot Tadej Pogacar, riding for UAE Team Emirates. Pogacar finished one minute and 29 seconds behind Roglic.\n\n\u201cYou try to go as fast as possible and I\u2019m happy with the performance for sure,\u201d Roglic told Spanish television channel tdp. \u201cI just tried to go as fast as possible. We\u2019ll have to wait until Madrid [to see if I win]. For sure I won today but we\u2019ll have to go day by day.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roglic in red on the podium.
