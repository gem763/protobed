But along with simply spending time with your grieving friend, the act of giving can also help express your condolences. \u201cA gift is a great way to show that you\u2019re thinking and you care,\u201d says Kelsey Crowe, author, speaker, and founder of Help Each Other Out.\n\nWhether you choose a gift that helps your friend through the grieving process, or one that honors the memory of their loved one, keep in mind that condolence gifts are largely symbolic of your love and support. \u201cIt\u2019s really about that communication, letting the person know you\u2019re here for them,\u201d according to R. Benyamin Cirlin, a social worker and the executive director of the Center for Loss and Renewal. Still, it can be nerve-racking to figure out what someone might want or need. That\u2019s why we asked Crowe, Cirlin, and three other grief experts about the best gifts to buy for people dealing with loss. But before we get to their picks, all of the experts say the sentiment is what counts when giving a condolence gift, and stress that you should include a meaningful note with whatever you give. Cirlin says this can be as simple as writing \u201cI\u2019m not even sure what to say,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m thinking about you,\u201d or recounting a happy memory you have of the person who died. Dr. Alan Wolfelt, director of the Center for Loss & Life Transition, adds that \u201cthey may forget down the line what gift you gave them but they won\u2019t forget the note.\u201d When it comes to writing the note, using a simple blank card like this is the best way to personalize your message.\n\nTraditional gifts\n\nGiftTree Fresh Fruit & Godiva Chocolate Gift Basket \u201cIn a lot of traditions, sending food offers comfort,\u201d says Cirlin, who says a \u201cfruit or nut basket\u201d like this can be a thoughtful gift. Besides providing mourners with sustenance during a wake or while sitting shiva, leftovers can feed grieving family members who don\u2019t have the time or energy to cook. Wolfelt told us about an old tradition in which friends and neighbors of the family would bring over homemade meals on some of their finer dishes. \u201cIt gave you a reason to go over after the funeral to retrieve the plate and sit at the table and [talk],\u201d he says, which is often helpful since opportunities to reminisce about the deceased can be rare once the formal funeral rites are over. As Cirlin says, \u201cto lose someone is to find yourself in a lonely space and one of the ways people heal is often by talking.\u201d $70 at Amazon Buy $70 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Bouqs Company Spotlight Wolfelt says that \u201cflowers are symbols of love in most cultures when words are inadequate.\u201d While they aren\u2019t given at Jewish funerals, flowers are otherwise a nice way to show you care. From $39 at The Bouqs Company Buy\n\nIf you\u2019d rather not give flowers that wilt within a few days, Cirlin recommends giving \u201ca plant with some staying power.\u201d Go with something low-maintenance that the recipient won\u2019t have to worry about taking care of during this difficult time. \u201cA small, easy-to-care-for succulent in a beautiful little pot is almost always appropriate,\u201d says Wolfelt. Here\u2019s a set of four hearty succulents with pots to match.\n\nThe Magnolia Company Southern Magnolia Tree Sapling It\u2019s a bit more of a project, but for friends with outdoor space, grief counselor Jill S. Cohen likes the idea of gifting a kit that lets recipients plant a tree in honor of their loved one. She says that being able to look at the tree as the years go by \u201ckeeps a piece of that memory alive.\u201d $65 at Food52 Buy\n\nHelpful gifts\n\nHandy 3-Hour Cleaning Gift Card $99 (was $129, now 23% off) Sometimes the best gift you can give is help with daily tasks that a grieving person isn\u2019t able to handle at the moment. \u201cMourners have what we call the \u2018lethargy of grief\u2019 for months and months after loss,\u201d says Wolfelt. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the energy to clean the house or cook a meal.\u201d It might not be something a friend comes out and asks for, but experts agree it\u2019s something they\u2019ll appreciate. \u201cNo one likes to ask for help and most times when they\u2019re grieving they\u2019re in a pretty big fog,\u201d says Cohen. You can offer to clean, babysit, or cook; or treat them to a professional cleaning service for a day. $99 at Handy Buy\n\nSeamless Gift Card Or give them a night (or week) of dinner delivered with a Seamless gift card. Diane P. Brennan, grief counselor at Life & Loss Mental Health Counseling and founder of the 20-20 Grief Project, says these \u201cgifts of time\u201d are ideal for \u201cgiving the person time to do the things that they need to do to support their grief.\u201d Along with taking the time to mourn, there are often responsibilities that come with the death of a family member, like settling their estate or cleaning out their home. From $10 at Seamless Buy\n\nJoseph Joseph Nest 12-Piece Food Storage Container Set $35 (was $42, now 17% off) While they\u2019re less exciting than some of the other gifts on this list, there are a few household items you can give that will make someone\u2019s life a little easier. \u201cPeople receive a lot of food, so maybe [give them] a nice way to store that food, like Tupperware,\u201d says Crowe. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a way of showing that you know inside the way of loss. That there\u2019s just these practicalities that come up.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nU Brands Hanging File Desk Organizer, Wire Metal, Copper \u201cDealing with someone who\u2019s died means dealing with so much paperwork,\u201d says Crowe. \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d Gifting something like an organizer shows you really understand what they\u2019re going through. Here\u2019s one that\u2019s pretty enough to repurpose in happier times. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nSelf-care gifts\n\nSpafinder Wellness 365 Gift Card Lots of our experts suggest gifts that offer the grieving person an opportunity to feel pampered because, as Cirlin says, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be challenged to take care of yourself\u201d during this tough time. Cohen agrees that a massage offers \u201ca way in the upcoming weeks or days to have a gentle thing to do for yourself.\u201d Wolfelt adds that \u201cmany mourners appreciate touch and, after somebody \u2014 particularly a significant life partner \u2014 dies, you lose that.\u201d From $50 at Amazon Buy From $50 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Honest Company Bubble Bath For at-home wellness, few things beat a bubble bath. To add a personal touch, Crowe suggests writing a note like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what would give you comfort in this time, but bubble baths always help me.\u201d Writer Hannah Morrill loves this Honest Company bubble bath because it leaves her feeling \u201cclean and quenched and lightly scented.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nEider & Ivory Brampt Herringbone Throw $89 (was $120, now 26% off) Lots of times people in mourning won\u2019t have the energy to get off the couch for a while, so Cohen suggests a cozy throw blanket to give them comfort through those early days. \u201cYou might have a hundred blankets, but this one came as a gift from you to me to give me comfort,\u201d she says. \u201cWho couldn\u2019t use an extra throw blanket?\u201d This super soft herringbone throw is a favorite of interior decorators. $89 at Wayfair Buy\n\nThe Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion $12 (was $16, now 25% off) Books on grief can be tricky as you don\u2019t want it to feel like a reading assignment, nor do you want to come across as giving unsolicited advice. Cirlin says \u201cyou can read 5,000 books and you wake up the next day and your loved one is still dead and you still feel like crap.\u201d But experts do like Joan Didion\u2019s memoir chronicling the year after her husband died. It\u2019s not a self-help book, but rather one that offers a portrayal of grief that others can identify with. Cohen says The Year of Magical Thinking \u201cresonates with everybody,\u201d and it was the most-recommended title when we wrote about the best books about grief. \u201cThey may not want to read it right away, but gradually they\u2019ll open it up and it\u2019ll probably be helpful,\u201d says Cohen. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nGifts for remembering a loved one\n\nPrintworks Photo Album Several experts we spoke with recommended sharing photos of the deceased as a way to preserve their memory. As Wolfelt says, \u201cdeath ends a life not a relationship,\u201d and it\u2019s important for grieving friends or family members to honor that relationship by remembering their loved one. Cohen adds that \u201cyou want to keep seeing that person in photos.\u201d An elegant album gives them a place to keep those photos, and if you can even include some of your own pictures of good times spent with the family. $43 at Anthropologie Buy\n\nLevel Frames Weathered Black Custom-Framed Photo Wolfelt says \u201ca small photo of the person who died in a nice frame\u201d is another way to honor their memory. If you want to get a photo professionally framed, we like Level Frames because it\u2019s an easy-to-use service and they ship fast. Strategist writer Liza Corsillo recommends this weathered black frame that\u2019s \u201cdark but with subtle highlights that keep it from looking too heavy or serious.\u201d $65 at Level Frames Buy\n\nFull Photo White Photo Mug, 11oz People love mugs and people love handmade things. Find a way to combine those by printing a photo with the person who is gone on a mug. \u201cThat\u2019s really meaningful,\u201d says Crowe. \u201cThat just shows: I love you.\u201d She warns that it\u2019s probably best for it to be a group photo and not just the person alone: \u201cThat might be a bit much.\u201d Cohen also likes the idea of printing a photo on any things your friend will regularly use. \u201cIf it\u2019s a good photo, it\u2019s an excellent memory,\u201d she says. $10 at Walmart Buy\n\nGifts for grieving kids\n\nWalnut Hollow Unfinished Wood Keepsake Box $14 (was $19, now 26% off) Just like adults, grieving kids will enjoy preserving the memory of their loved one through photos, objects, and letters. If the child was close with the person who died, they might enjoy creating a memory box for the personal things they shared. \u201cThe idea is that the box is going to be the place where you\u2019re going to hold your memories of the person,\u201d says Brennan. \u201cIt could be tangible items, like a baseball from someone\u2019s grandfather, pictures of him, notes he wrote.\u2019\u201d Cohen likes the idea of \u201csmall wooden boxes that the kids can paint,\u201d and Brennan also suggests pairing the box with art supplies so kids can actively create something to deal with their loss. $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Fall of Freddie the Leaf by Leo Buscaglia Cirlin and Cohen both suggest age-appropriate books to help children understand their feelings around grief. This title, which also comes highly recommended by grief experts, is one of Brennan\u2019s favorites. She says, \u201cIt\u2019s a story of a tree and the leaves coming into the fall, and it has analogies to death\u201d that resonate with kids. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
