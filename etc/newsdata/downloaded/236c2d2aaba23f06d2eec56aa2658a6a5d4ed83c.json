Police have closed it and fired tear gas at brick-throwing protesters.\n\nPolice earlier prevented major unrest on the airport metro system.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill but morphed into a wider pro-democracy campaign.\n\nIssues such as universal suffrage, a demand for an inquiry into police actions and the alleged involvement of gangs in countering the protests have come to the fore.\n\nThe campaign, mostly conducted by young people, was peaceful to start with but has become increasingly violent.\n\nThe unrest has become the biggest challenge to China's rule since Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed back by Britain in 1997.\n\nHong Kong is part of China, but enjoys \"special freedoms\". Those are set to expire in 2047, and many in Hong Kong don't want to become \"another Chinese city\".\n\nWhat happened on Sunday?\n\nThe unsanctioned rally at the New Town Plaza started on a small scale and peacefully.\n\nVideo footage then showed a Chinese flag being trampled by protesters before being carried out and thrown into a river.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Riot police moved in as the unrest worsened at the New Town Plaza shopping centre\n\nMasked protesters used fire extinguishers to smash the glass of information maps, then sprayed water and threw rubbish bins down escalators.

The airport has become one of the high-profile targets of protesters.\n\nBut police stepped up security and authorities reduced transport links to head off possible unrest.\n\nThe Airport Express metro link was open only to passengers boarding at Hong Kong island.\n\nOnly people with flight tickets could board.\n\nMore on the Hong Kong protests:\n\nHow is Hong Kong run? and what is the Basic Law?\n\nThe background to the protests in video\n\nA visual guide to how one peaceful protest turned violent\n\nWhat's the background?\n\nProtests began in June in opposition to a proposed bill that would have made it possible for people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China.\n\nCritics said they could have faced human rights abuses.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 100 days of protests in Hong Kong in 100 seconds\n\nThe bill was initially shelved, and later withdrawn completely, but this has failed to quell the protesters' anger.\n\nTheir demands have been rejected by both Beijing and Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who on Sunday again vowed to stop the violence.", "description": "Bricks are thrown and tear gas fired as a shopping centre is vandalised in continued protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p16ct.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
