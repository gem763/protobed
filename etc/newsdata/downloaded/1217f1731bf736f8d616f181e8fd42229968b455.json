Among the attendees were Emory Douglas, who was the party\u2019s minister of culture; Fredrika Newton, widow of the party\u2019s co-founder Huey Newton; and the Black Panther illustrator Gayle Dickson. Organized by the Oakland-based People\u2019s Kitchen Collective (PKC), the gathering was scored by soul music and warm conversations from communal tables.\n\nNow in its eighth year, the breakfast was one of the PKC\u2019s biggest, serving 650 plates of grits, greens, scrambled eggs and tofu. At the edge of the feast, an altar decorated with flowers and seeds held framed photographs of Black Panther members, activists, and mothers to whom this breakfast owed its legacy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Black Panther poster, courtesy Emory Douglas.

On that first morning, BPP members fed 11 children. By the week\u2019s end, the number had grown to 135.\n\nBilly X Jennings, a former Panther who now serves as the party\u2019s archivist, worked at the original breakfast program at St Augustine\u2019s. \u201cEvery office was required to send two people to learn how it ran so you can open one in your area,\u201d he said. Jennings would work at St Augustine\u2019s early in the morning before heading to class at Laney College. Soon after, the breakfast service expanded to 23 locations around Oakland.\n\nThe Black Panthers still in prison: after 46 years, will they ever be set free?

By the end of 1969, the program fed 20,000 children across 19 cities. Its unprecedented success was countered by destructive raids of pantries and party headquarters by police. \u201cJ Edgar Hoover was scared of the program because it brought prestige to the party,\u201d Jennings recalled. In an internal FBI memo, Hoover wrote: \u201cThe [Program] represents the best and most influential activity going for the BPP and, as such, is potentially the greatest threat to efforts by authorities to neutralize the BPP and destroy what it stands for\u201d. Six years later, in 1975, the US government started offering free breakfast in public schools.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boys eat during a free breakfast in New York, winter 1969.

That\u2019s what a vanguard party does. We set examples for people to follow.\u201d\n\nThough the breakfast program is the most famous of the party\u2019s Survival Programs, more than 60 others directly addressed the needs of the black community that were being systematically ignored. Jennings recounts other schemes including a free of charge senior escort program, a monthly bus to prisons to see incarcerated loved ones, and the establishment of 13 medical clinics across the country.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sita Bhaumik and Jocelyn Jackson, two of the three co-founders of People\u2019s Kitchen Collective.

She beams with admiration for the party\u2019s trailblazing work.\n\n\u201cOur society is not going to support our existence. They would actually prefer if we faded away. So in that moment, what are we going to do? The Black Panthers, they said we will provide,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThis was a moment of yes from our past that we want to be in our present. And so we will do that year after year after year. We will be in that park that has so much history of bringing our community together and say every year: we want you to survive.\u201d\n\nLil Bobby Hutton Park \u2013 named after the 17-year-old first recruit to the Black Panther party, who was shot and killed by Oakland police \u2013 was the site of many Panther activities. Today, the West Oakland park, also known as De Fremery Park, sits at the edge of a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. The city\u2019s downtown construction boom creeps closer as it demolishes old buildings and replaces them with high-rises to attract tech prospectors from across the bridge. Local residents point out key Panther landmarks such as their first headquarters in North Oakland and the street where Hutton was shot dead. But there are no statues or commemorative plaques.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emory Douglas, left, the party\u2019s minister of culture, and Ishan Bobino, a Panther cub, or young party member.

Saturday\u2019s breakfast included cups of rose-hip tea from Mak-\u2019amham, a food and culture survival project from the chefs Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino celebrating the history of the East Bay\u2019s indigenous Ohlone tribes. Bhaumik said she discovered the Mak-\u2019amham project after researching the land in West Oakland.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out what was growing there, what the [original] food sources were. And when I met [Medina], he said: you\u2019re asking me in the past tense. You need to be asking that question in the present tense.\u201d Bhaumik and PKC shared that lesson with breakfast attendees. \u201cYou cannot deny the present existence of indigenous peoples if you have the first flavors of the land in your body.\u201d", "description": "The party\u2019s program to feed kids, launched in 1969, became a national phenomenon.
