The protesters erupted in cheers at the news.\n\nThe Hezbollah rampage marked a violent turning point in Lebanon\u2019s protests, which have called for the resignation of the government and the overthrow of the political class that has dominated the country since the 1975-1990 civil war. The government is dominated by factions allied with Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the country.\n\nHariri had reluctantly worked with those factions as part of a national unity government that had failed to address an increasingly severe economic and fiscal crisis.\n\n\u201cI tried all this time to find an exit and listen to the voice of the people and protect the country from the security and economic dangers,\u201d Hariri said. \u201cToday, to be honest with you, I have hit a dead end, and it is time for a big shock to confront the crisis.\u201d\n\nA proposed tax on the WhatsApp messenger service ignited protests on Oct. 17, sending hundreds of thousands of people into the streets in the largest demonstrations in more than a decade. The protests soon widened to include other economic issues.\n\nThey were largely peaceful, with only occasional minor scuffles with security forces, but that changed early Tuesday, when groups of men began confronting protesters who were blocking roads.\n\nThe men initially presented themselves as disgruntled residents frustrated by the country\u2019s paralysis, but they later could be heard chanting, \u201cAt your service, Hussein,\u201d a Shiite religious slogan, and \u201cGod, Nasrallah, and the whole Dahiyeh,\u201d referring to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and the group\u2019s stronghold in the southern suburbs of Beirut.\n\nThey launched their attack about midday on the main protest camp in Beirut where demonstrators have been staying for nearly two weeks. The rallies swell at night, but there were only a few dozen protesters in the square when the Hezbollah supporters arrived.\n\nSoldiers and riot police initially moved in to separate the groups but were unable to prevent the Hezbollah supporters from storming Martyrs\u2019 Square in central Beirut, the main protest site. Hezbollah supporters lashed out at reporters covering the melee, kicking some of them and reaching for their cameras.\n\nIt was unclear how many people were wounded. Fights broke out in places and security forces could be seen beating some people with batons.\n\nThe protesters armed themselves with wooden batons and metal poles as the Hezbollah supporters approached but fled when the counterdemonstrators arrived in larger numbers.\n\nSecurity forces later fired tear gas to disperse them, but only after they had destroyed and set fire to several tents.\n\nNasrallah had criticized the protests last week, accusing unspecified foreign powers of exploiting them to undermine his group and saying they threatened to drag the country into civil war.\n\nHezbollah was the only armed group in Lebanon to maintain its weapons after the civil war, saying they were needed to defend the country from Israel, which occupied parts of southern Lebanon from 1982 until 2000. Hezbollah later fought Israel to a stalemate during a ferocious monthlong war in 2006.\n\nHezbollah is widely seen as being more militarily powerful than even the Lebanese armed forces.\n\nGroups of protesters eventually returned to the main squares and began repairing their tents, while others went back to blocking the roads. They could be heard chanting one of the main slogans of the protests, \u201cAll means all,\u201d which is seen as referring to all of Lebanon\u2019s political factions, including Hezbollah and its allies.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sarah El Deeb and Joseph Krauss contributed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lebanon's prime minister resigned Tuesday, bowing to one of the central demands of anti-government demonstrators shortly after baton-wielding Hezbollah supporters rampaged through the main protest camp in Beirut, torching tents, smashing plastic chairs and chasing away protesters.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrea Rosa", "Bilal Hussein"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/29/APTOPIX_Lebanon_Protests_61999.jpg-30625_c0-59-5400-3209_s1200x700.jpg?c18d7a53134094e434e85de5faad69a6e6321518", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
