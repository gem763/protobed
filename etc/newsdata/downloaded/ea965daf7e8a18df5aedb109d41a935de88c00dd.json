That\u2019s the unenviable position Vlatko Andonovski finds himself in.\n\nAndonovski was named Monday as the new coach of US women\u2019s national team, taking over for Jill Ellis, who stepped down last month \u2013 and he arrives at a time when the two-time reigning World Cup champions seem due for regression. After all, what goes up must come down \u2013 but it may be the addition of Andonovski, who leaves a coaching gig in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, that can help the USWNT defy physics for a little while longer.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s blown us away\u2019: how high school soccer team\u2019s equal pay push caught fire Read more\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to understand why the job opened up for Andonovski. Ellis stepped down after leading the US to two Women\u2019s World Cup titles, but the less-discussed aspect of her tenure is a disastrous run through the 2016 Olympics, where the US suffered its earliest exit in a major tournament in the history of the team. Ellis\u2019s reasoning for stepping away hasn\u2019t been terribly specific, but surely going out on top and avoiding the tarnish of another Olympic setback played a factor.\n\nNow, the short turnaround to the 2020 Olympics, only nine months away, becomes Andonovski\u2019s problem.\n\nBut if there\u2019s a coach who could step in under such circumstances, it\u2019s probably Andonovski, who has spent the past six years working with the USWNT player pool via the NWSL. He won two NWSL championships with FC Kansas City, and last week was named this season\u2019s NWSL coach of the year for his impressive work with an injury-riddled Reign in Seattle, where he had to field more than 30 players and the team still made playoffs.\n\nBut for anyone who hasn\u2019t been watching the NWSL on a regular basis, Andonovski is a name that may feel like it\u2019s arrived out of nowhere. After all, he has no international management experience \u2013 not even at the youth level \u2013 and it\u2019s been a meteoric rise for the 43-year-old Macedonian who no one outside of Kansas City had heard of until a few years ago.\n\nIn 2000, he arrived in the United States speaking little English to play professional indoor soccer, and he ended up at the Kansas City Comets, where he\u2019d finish his playing career. In 2012, when the Comets ownership group launched a team in the new National Women\u2019s Soccer League called FC Kansas City, they asked Andonovski to coach it. Some USWNT players actively opposed being allocated there because they hadn\u2019t heard of Andonovski and weren\u2019t sure what kind of coach he\u2019d be.\n\nBut he quickly established himself as a tactically smart coach who pushed his teams to play aesthetically attractive possession football while managing the personalities in the locker room.\n\nHis players rave about how he made them better. Megan Rapinoe, the reigning best player in the world, has said he\u2019s something of a tactical mastermind, quick to adapt when necessary, but that he excels at helping players understand what he wants and convincing them to buy in.\n\nAfter veterans on the US women\u2019s national team tried unsuccessfully to get Ellis fired before the World Cup in France, and none of them offered any kind parting words for Ellis in her final days on otherwise active social media accounts, it appears the players are getting what they want with Andonovski. The coach search was led by general manager Kate Markgraf but player input was weighed heavily, and Andonovski was the top pick amongst the USWNT core.\n\nAndonovski can be intense as a coach. His former staff at FC Kansas City tell stories about secretly moving Andonovski\u2019s perfectly placed cones for drills to drive him mad \u2013 something Andonovski always noticed and fixed, frustrated with himself for his errors. When he interviewed for the job, he overwhelmed the owners with how much research he had prepared.\n\nBut his approach as a people manager is softer \u2013 he can be blunt, but his players regard him as a calming influence. When the Reign lost a playoff game last year in Portland, Andonovski took responsibility for the result and told his players he had not prepared them well enough for how physical the match got. He also shook the hand of each reporter in the mixed zone and thanked them for covering the NWSL.\n\nOf course, being nice isn\u2019t necessarily an asset for the USWNT manager job. Every coach since Tony DiCicco has been pushed out due to a player revolt, or the players have at least tried.\n\nAndonovski, however, has a leg up due to his work in the NWSL. He is the first USWNT coach that takes the helm directly from coaching USWNT pool players in a domestic league. His transition to the national team figures to be seamless with his knowledge of the American player landscape.\n\nIt remains to be seen how happy the players stay with their pick, though. Andonovski reportedly already has a list of players who have been plying their trade in Europe that he\u2019d like to give a look at an identification camp in December. The competition for roster spots will only get tougher as Andonovski, who is so thorough in his research, leaves no stone unturned.\n\nHe may not check every box some fans or players may have wanted from a coach. He has no national team experience as a coach or player, and international soccer follows a very different rhythm that club soccer. The transition from the club game is not always smooth. He\u2019s also not a woman, something Markgraf said would be preferable.\n\nBut when the job at hand is taking the best team in the world and ensuring it stays the best, Andonovski\u2019s temperament, ability to manage personalities, and passion for development seem like just what the USWNT needs.\n\nFor all the doom and gloom predictions every cycle about the world surpassing the athletic Americans, it hasn\u2019t happened yet \u2013 and a tactically astute pragmatist who can continue Ellis\u2019s obsession with identifying and adding new talent to the player pool ought to be enough to keep the Americans on track.", "description": "It\u2019s been a meteoric rise for the 43-year-old Macedonian unknown outside Kansas City until a few years ago, but he may be the perfect choice to succeed Jill Ellis as USA manager", "authors": ["Caitlin Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976ccbb9e3f3a26e18bc0d963a98ab9fcf0a2384/0_158_3780_2268/master/3780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49a86bfce7c4fdbe0fc3e9f960189403", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
