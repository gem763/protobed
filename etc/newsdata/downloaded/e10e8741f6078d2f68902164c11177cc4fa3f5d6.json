On Tuesday, he told Congress why - in damning detail.\n\nMuch of Mr Taylor's opening statement corroborates other reported accounts of White House efforts to get Ukraine to open investigations that could be damaging to Democrats, and Vice-President Joe Biden in particular. The acting ambassador to Ukraine fleshed out the picture, however, and added new perspective.\n\nIn one particular passage, Mr Taylor relates a conversation he had with Gordon Sondland - one of the co-ordinators of what he said was an \"irregular, informal channel of US policymaking\".\n\nMr Sondland, he said, told him \"everything\" - including military aid and a White House visit - was dependent on the Ukrainian president making a public statement that he would order these investigations.\n\nIn Latin they call that a \"quid pro quo\".\n\nThe president's defenders will try to undermine Mr Taylor's credibility, although the career diplomat makes for a compelling witness. They may eventually assert that even if Mr Taylor's claims are true, it's still within the president's foreign policy powers.\n\nThat will, of course, be up to members of the House - and, perhaps, senators in an impeachment trial - to decide.\n\nWhat is the impeachment inquiry about?\n\nThree committees in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives are investigating allegations of wrongdoing by the president.\n\nDemocrats accuse him of illegally pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political rival.\n\nBut there is a fierce debate about whether Mr Trump committed an impeachable offence - he himself says he has done nothing wrong.\n\nIf the House finds sufficient evidence, articles of impeachment will be put to a vote. If they are approved, proceedings will move to trial in the Senate, which is controlled by Mr Trump's Republicans.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What does it take to impeach a president?\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nDemocratic congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz described Mr Taylor's appearance as \"the most damning testimony I've heard\".\n\n\"He drew a very specific direct line from President Trump to the withholding of foreign aid and the refusal of a [presidential] meeting.\"\n\nFellow Democrats echoed this idea and praise Mr Taylor's \"meticulous\" note taking.\n\nCongressman Tom Malinowski said it was the \"most thorough\" account that filled in \"details that some other witnesses, somehow, forgot\".\n\nBut Republican congressman Mark Meadows, a staunch Trump ally, told reporters he did not hear \"anything that has advanced the quid pro quo or the promise of anything with foreign aid\".\n\n\"There's no-one who can be intellectually honest and come out of that deposition and suggest otherwise.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Mr Trump controversially called the inquiry \"a lynching\" - a term referring to historic killings by white mobs mainly against black Americans.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday, Mr Trump said Republicans should \"get tougher and fight\" impeachment proceedings.", "description": "Ties between the two allies were undermined for \"political reasons\", a top diplomat tells Congress.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AAA3/production/_109038634_hi056805066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
