Units range from about $650,000 to almost $1.97 million (US$1.48 million) for a 1,163 square foot three-bedroom suite. Add in parking for $169,000.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re selling out like crazy,\u201d said Dawna Borg, a broker at RE/MAX Premier Inc., who spent more than three hours at the sales office one Saturday trying to snag units for her clients. \u201cWe had to go back Sunday and just wait for a new allocation to come out, and we still didn\u2019t 100 per cent get what we wanted.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for RioCan REIT, which is developing the building with Metropia and Capital Developments, said more than 70 per cent of the units have been sold since the mid-September launch.\n\nCanada\u2019s housing market is back with a roar this fall. Benchmark prices in Toronto jumped 5.2 per cent to $805,500 in September from a year earlier, only about US$10,000 below their peak two years ago. While prices in Vancouver continue to fall, sales rebounded 46 per cent, the third month in a row of year-on-year gains. Montreal and Ottawa continue to chug along and even in beleaguered Calgary, the energy capital of Canada, sales rose 8.2 per cent in September from last year.\n\nIn contrast, the housing market is sobering up in Manhattan, as resale prices for condos and co-ops dropped 8 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 2012. Sales have also declined over the past two years.\n\nWe're having the best back-to-back month since 2017\n\nNew regulations in Canada, including stricter mortgage criteria and tax increases to cool foreign purchases, helped stem runaway price gains through 2018. Those appear to have been largely absorbed \u2014 aided by the global drop in borrowing rates, record immigration and a strong labour market. That\u2019s put housing affordability front and centre in the federal election campaign.\n\n\u201cI worked 90 hours in one week,\u201d said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, a real-estate management company. He sold 30 condos in one weekend. \u201cThe pre-sale market is on fire again but resale has picked up too: We\u2019re having the best back-to-back month since 2017.\u201d\n\nSupply Puzzle\n\nCanada\u2019s population rose 531,497 to 37.6 million in July, the biggest year-over-year increase in records going back to the 1970s, according to the federal statistics agency. Many are ending up in Toronto\u2019s booming tech and financial-services sector or attending the city\u2019s many universities and colleges.\n\nSupply is lagging demand with even the International Monetary Fund this week urging Canada to ease a thicket of red tape constraining construction such as permitting and zoning delays. Government-related fees on new Toronto homes are among the highest in North America, according to an industry group, which can add almost $223,000 to the cost of a new detached home.\n\n\u201cThe demand side of the equation is incredibly strong and the supply side is a puzzle that has not been figured out by anybody,\u201d said Sasha Cucuz, a partner at Greybrook Capital, a private-equity firm with a North American real estate portfolio valued at more than $15 billion, including projects underway. \u201cWhen you couple those together, that\u2019s an indisputable upward pressure on pricing, flat out, whether it\u2019s rental or housing.\u201d\n\nElection Outcome\n\nBoth the Liberal and Conservative parties are promising to make home buying more affordable on the campaign trail. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pledging to boost the cap on homes eligible for a 10 per cent government-equity stake to almost $800,000 in costly markets like Vancouver and Toronto. The Conservatives plan to extend mortgage amortizations and review the mortgage stress test for first-time buyers and remove it from mortgage renewals.\n\nThough the fall housing market has kicked off with several big condo launches, the buying period before the election will still be a bit iffy, Borg, the RE/MAX broker, said.\n\nThey really need to revisit that stress test \u2014 it's causing people a lot of stress Dawna Borg, a broker at RE/MAX Premier\n\n\u201cNo one really knows what to expect: Who\u2019s going to be in power? Are there going to be new rules? Because they really need to revisit that stress test \u2014 it\u2019s causing people a lot of stress,\u201d Borg said.\n\nPrices in Calgary and Vancouver are still below recent records, down 5.9 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, according to Teranet-National Bank Home Price Indexes.\n\nRental Pain\n\nLofty home prices have pushed many prospective buyers into the rental market, where vacancy rates are at historically low levels and rents continue to rise.\n\n\u201cDespite purpose-built apartment construction rising four-fold since 2014, rental supply is unlikely to come close to demand in the coming years,\u201d Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a report last month. \u201cA deliberate policy to boost rental supply is needed \u2014 with specific targets and incentives to achieve them.\u201d\n\nThe bank estimates the number of renter households will jump by an average of 22,200 per year in Toronto. To restore equilibrium over a two-year time frame, Toronto would have to add an average of 26,800 units per year.\n\nThe federal government housing agency has ramped up incentives for new rental development, including a rental-financing initiative, but projected rental supply falls short of what\u2019s needed and needs to at least double, Hogue said.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "One real estate broker says he sold 30 condos in one weekend", "authors": ["Natalie Wong", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sold.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
