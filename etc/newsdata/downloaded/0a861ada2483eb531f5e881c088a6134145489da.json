The women who were mourning were North Korean defectors who had never met the deceased before but they claimed the same death could have occurred to one of them and that it was their fault that the victims died so isolated.\n\nIt was near the end of July when Han and her son were found dead in their small, rented apartment. A water meter inspector smelled the stench of their decomposing bodies and notified the janitor.\n\nThe bodies were so badly decomposed that the National Forensics Service could not conclusively identify the cause of death after the bodies went undiscovered for over two months, according to police.
