(Picture: Instagram)\n\nA previous statement a source told People Miley ended things to \u2018focus on her career\u2019. It said: \u2018Miley doesn\u2019t want a serious relationship. She and Kaitlynn spent every day together and it just wasn\u2019t anything that Miley wanted to continue doing.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Miley is making the most of the single life, slamming those who have tried to slut-shame her and addressing the double standards about men being able to move on quickly without judgement: \u2018Get used to me dating \u2013 this is where I am at!\u2019\n\nThe We Can\u2019t Stop hitmaker is also taking this new chapter in her life to reflect on her achievements, celebrating six years of her infamous album Bangerz which changed her life forever.\n\n\u2018Here\u2019s to 6 more years of p***ing people off,\u2019 she wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nAnd she seems keen to channel her creativity into making some more music, sharing snaps of herself in a studio.\n\nFrankly we can\u2019t wait.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
