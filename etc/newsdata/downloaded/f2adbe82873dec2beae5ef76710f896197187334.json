Much of it has been fair, a charity last year condemning the \u201cmisleading and potentially dangerous\u201d claims regularly promoted by the brand. But there\u2019s also something quietly brilliant about Paltrow\u2019s complete lack of artifice when it comes to what she and, by extension, Goop represents \u2013 advice and products from rich people and for rich people, with little interest in appealing to anyone else. And if the rich so regularly get sucked into it, despite its overt silliness, more fool them.\n\nAs a public figure, Paltrow is recognised as being ridiculous, ludicrously wealthy and fascinated by quackery and very expensive means to fill the holes in your life. It is a persona that has generated as much in the way of column inches as it has genuine dislike, but it\u2019s also made her easy to somewhat guiltily admire. Because to enjoy Paltrow is to wholeheartedly accept that she is both a force for good and a force for blonde, capitalist evil.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

There\u2019s a cartoonish, almost surreally oblivious side of Gwyneth Paltrow that forgets she\u2019s in Marvel movies and steadfastly refuses to remember who her co-stars are. There\u2019s also the side of her that is regularly self-aware, thoughtful and brave. This month it was revealed that Paltrow played a significant role in getting the Harvey Weinstein expos\u00e9 off the ground, journalists Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor recalling that she was one of the earliest star names willing to speak off the record about her experiences with the disgraced producer, at one point hiding in her bathroom when Weinstein showed up uninvited to a party she was hosting, terrified that he had somehow found out she had spoken to them.\n\nHer latest acting role, shot around her work as CEO of Goop, also drives home her unique likeability. In The Politician, Ryan Murphy\u2019s first series for Netflix and one co-created by Paltrow\u2019s husband Brad Falchuk, she plays a gloriously camp pastiche of herself: dripping in jewels, obsessed with money and healing crystals and mind-numbingly oblivious to reality. That Paltrow was so game to send up her own image is a stroke of PR genius, and one that hints she is entirely aware of the absurdity of being Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe show is also a reminder of how magnetic Paltrow is as an actor. In the pantheon of great movie stars, Paltrow is rarely mentioned. Even her 1999 Oscar win, only remembered as it produced one of the most overwhelmingly weepy acceptance speeches in the ceremony\u2019s history, is often spoken of negatively \u2013 a reflection of Weinstein\u2019s awards-season machinations in his prime, and not that her performance in Shakespeare in Love was genuinely warm, passionate and award-worthy.\n\nBut it does a disservice to how fantastic she so often was, before she created Goop in her kitchen and realised she could make more money and have real autonomy over her life by veering away from acting. Her performance in Wes Anderson\u2019s The Royal Tenenbaums remains her masterwork, a fantastically deadpan supporting turn that burnt with angst and disappointment. But there are others, too: the tragic radiance of her role as Brad Pitt\u2019s doomed wife in Se7en; her sparky, endearingly bitchy interpretation of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma; her loose, vibrant messiness in James Gray\u2019s underrated romantic drama Two Lovers; how she punctuated every sentence with one clunky British colloquialism after another in the endlessly rewatchable if entirely insane Sliding Doors. And in her first major acting role in 1993\u2019s neo-noir Flesh and Bone, she is remarkably captivating \u2013 playing a ruthless, haunted teen grifter wafting aimlessly through small-town America on James Caan\u2019s arm.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You could say she\u2019s gamine. You could say she\u2019s gorgeous. You could say all those things, and they would be true, but it\u2019s the particular mixture \u2013 and the non-specificness \u2013 that makes her fascinating. We saw that in Flesh and Bone. As soon as she came on the screen, you thought, \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019\u201d\n\nPaltrow\u2019s acting brilliance has often been eclipsed by outside forces. In her movie-star prime in the late Nineties, her public image was of pure, pre-Millennium Waspy radiance \u2013 all crisp Calvin Klein ensembles and flat-ironed hair; a sentient air freshener romantically involved with Hollywood\u2019s hunkiest pin-ups of the era, from Brad Pitt to Ben Affleck. On Popular, Ryan Murphy\u2019s short-lived teen comedy that ran from 1999 to 2001, Paltrow was treated like a god by the show\u2019s mean, blonde and ruthless villainesses primarily because of how she presented herself. \u201cWe live in the age of Gwyneth and that is the standard by which all things are judged,\u201d one character declared in the show\u2019s first episode. In another, two characters kidnapped Paltrow\u2019s personal shopper and pawed over the sweaters and skirts he had bought for her.\n\nHer family connections, from Blythe Danner (her mother) to Spielberg (her godfather), were additionally used as evidence that her success had been unearned. The fact that Weinstein repeatedly told women he targeted that the pair had been sexually involved \u2013 a lie that trickled down through Hollywood business meetings and onto gossip blogs and into blind items in the years that followed \u2013 only perpetuated the idea that there was nothing truly \u201cthere\u201d \u2013 a star cynically made instead of born.\n\nConsidering how much she was belittled in her Hollywood prime, it is no surprise she found real joy elsewhere, founding Goop and becoming a kind of late-capitalist holy figure to individuals with far too much money. \u201cI was masquerading as an actor,\u201d she told The New York Times earlier this year. In 2018, she told the same newspaper that she never had \u201ctrue agency\u201d while acting full-time.\n\nWeinstein propositioning her was bad, she said, but she found the rest of his behaviour towards her somehow more damaging. \u201cIt was very quid pro quo and punitive, and I always felt like I was on thin ice, and he could be truly horrible and mean and then be incredibly generous,\u201d she said. Weinstein produced a number of her best-known hits, including Emma, Shakespeare in Love and The Talented Mr Ripley. \u201cIt was kind of like a classic abusive relationship,\u201d she explained.\n\nIn hindsight, it is sad to think of that period of her career through the lens of what we know now, from how often we poked fun at her to how secretly destructive things were for her behind the scenes. But it contributes to the wild complexities of her modern celebrity. Today she is a survivor deserving of enormous respect, a brilliant actor deserving of far greater appreciation and credit than we ever gave her when she was in movies constantly, and a pretentious, regularly maddening merchandiser of the world\u2019s rich, bored and emotionally bereft. Gwyneth Paltrow is all things all at once, and celebrity would be so much more boring without her.", "description": "In July, well-heeled British women raged to the celebrity US gossip site Page Six that they had paid extortionate amounts of money for little more than an \u201cintimate workout class\u201d and lessons on how to \u201chydrate mindfully\u201d from Gwyneth Paltrow, at a London \u201csummit\u201d for the star\u2019s wellness and lifestyle empire Goop", "authors": ["Adam White"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/19/15/gettyimages-1150194076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
