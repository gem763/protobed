He said that he came to London on the back of a lorry himself and referred to the deaths of the 39 people in the container in Essex this week as 'the luck of the draw'\n\nA people smuggler has laughed off the fate of the 39 migrants found dead in a shipping container, saying: \u2018It is the luck of the draw.\u2019\n\nThe British-based trafficker made the cruel comment as he offered to sneak an undercover reporter into the UK using the same route which ended in such tragedy last week.\n\nSeparately, Maurice Robinson, the 25-year-old lorry driver who went to collect the container, was last night charged with 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.\n\nJust hours after news of the appalling discovery of the bodies last week, our reporters discovered that a UK-based Albanian using the pseudonym \u2018Kace Kace\u2019 was offering to help smuggle migrants into the country.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has established that he is, in fact, called Kastrijot Ahmati and lives in Walthamstow, North East London. He claims to have been illegally smuggled into the UK in the back of a lorry himself.\n\nAhmati advertised his services and posted his mobile number on a Facebook page called \u2018Albanians in London\u2019, which has more than 16,000 followers.\n\nWhen an undercover reporter contacted him, he told her she could pay \u00a317,000 for \u2018fake papers\u2019 that would allow her to fly from the Albanian capital, Tirana.\n\nAlternatively, she could pay \u00a314,000 to be stowed away in the back of a lorry from Belgium \u2013 the origin of the container in which the 39 people died last week.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, just two days after the grim discovery at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex, Ahmati told the undercover reporter that the trip from Belgium can take between 12 and 16 hours, depending on whether \u2018the ferry is delayed\u2019.\n\nOut of the 36 individuals found dead in the back of a lorry container in Essex, 26 are believed to have travelled from Vietnam\n\nIn this file photo taken on October 23, 2019 British Police forensics officers work on lorry, found to be containing 39 dead bodies\n\n\u2018I have done it myself,\u2019 he said. \u2018I am trying to find you the easiest way, do you understand?\u2019\n\nThe reporter claimed she wanted to travel with another family member, but she was told they would have to be smuggled with other migrants otherwise the people trafficking gang would makes \u2018no profit\u2019.\n\nShe would pay on arrival in the UK, but Ahmati demanded the details of a friend in London who would guarantee the money.\n\nShocking, callous exchange with a cold-hearted crook Smartly dressed and sipping a Costa coffee, Kastrijot Ahmati does not stand out in a crowd. But today\u2019s investigation by The Mail on Sunday exposes him as part of a vile people smuggling network that puts the lives of desperate migrants at risk for profit. Brazenly posting his mobile number on Facebook, Ahmati offers to help smuggle people into the UK for between \u00a314,000 and \u00a317,000. In a Facebook video call with our undercover reporter, he shrugged off the deadly risks of stowing away in a lorry and laughed at the horrific death of 39 migrants last week. He told her that being smuggled in a truck from Belgium was safe and that he had travelled into the UK by lorry himself. \u2018I have done it myself. I came myself with the group that I mentioned to you, with my compatriots.\u2019 When the reporter said she was \u2018scared\u2019 after last week\u2019s tragedy, the trafficker sneered: \u2018It is the luck of the draw. That is how we all came.\u2019 Our investigator repeated her concerns, saying, \u2018We will die\u2019, but Ahmati simply laughed and declared: \u2018I do not know what to say, I am showing you the quickest and shortest route to the UK, I swear to God.\u2019 Then, in a sign that it is business as usual for the traffickers despite the tragedy in Essex, he told our investigator to be prepared to travel imminently. \u2018Maybe they will say at the end of the week, do you understand?\u2019\n\nWhen the reporter said she was \u2018scared\u2019 because of last week\u2019s tragedy, the trafficker replied: \u2018It is the luck of the draw. That is how we all came.\u2019\n\nWhen she continued to voice her fears, saying, \u2018We will die\u2019, Ahmati simply laughed.\n\nThe trafficker is believed to be from Has, a district in northern Albania, from which hundreds of migrants are thought to have left for the UK. It is not known how long he has lived in Britain, although Facebook posts suggest he has been here since at least September 2018. Earlier this month, he posted a video of himself smoking a cigarette and strolling around outside a London train station.\n\nWhen approached for comment last night, Ahmati answered the phone and confirmed he was in the UK. Speaking via a friend, he claimed he had been \u2018joking\u2019 in the messages posted online and during the telephone call. In response to a WhatsApp message asking him to explain his actions, he replied \u2018why\u2019. His \u2018Kace Kace\u2019 Facebook account was taken down shortly afterwards.\n\nOur investigation found Ahmati was one of four agents using the \u2018Albanians in London\u2019 Facebook page to help migrants smuggle their way into the UK.\n\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) last year said Albanian gangs operating at the \u2018higher end of sophistication\u2019 were largely responsible for the surge in migrants being smuggled into the UK.\n\nThe total number of known victims of modern slavery and trafficking rocketed by 80 per cent between 2016 and 2018 to 6,993, according to NCA figures. The victims came from 130 countries with the most foreign nationals \u2013 1,625 \u2013 coming from Albania.\n\nLast night David Wood, former director-general of immigration enforcement at the Home Office, explained how Albanian traffickers operated: \u2018What tends to happen is the groups have agents in source countries. That will include China, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent. \u2018These agents will be peddling the mythical, \u201cGet to the UK, it\u2019s the land of milk and honey\u201d.\u2019\n\nLast night our dossier of material, including Ahmati\u2019s identity, was made available to the Metropolitan Police. A force spokesman said any relevant information would be passed to investigating officers.\n\nThe Waterglade Industrial Park where 39 bodies were found in a lorry container. Bodies of 39 people found in a lorry container, Grays, Essex, UK\n\nThe trucker arrested after the horrific discovery of a lorry containing the bodies of 39 people was last night charged with manslaughter.\n\nDriver charged over 39 lorry deaths: Police probe claim truck was in convoy of 3 carrying 100 migrants\n\nMaurice Robinson, 25, has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter over the Essex migrant tragedy\n\nAfter three days in custody, Maurice \u2018Mo\u2019 Robinson was charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, as well as conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.\n\nRobinson, 25, from Craigavon, County Armagh in Northern Ireland, will appear before Chelmsford Magistrates tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile a second lorry driver in his 20s was arrested yesterday at Dublin\u2019s port. Last night he was in custody.\n\nAlso being held were a couple from Warrington, Cheshire, who were arrested on Friday.\n\nThe arrest of the second lorry driver came as it was claimed that the refrigerated trailer in which the dead migrants were found may have been part of a larger convoy of three lorries carrying up to 100 people.\n\nAccording to a Catholic priest representing families who fear their loved ones are among the dead, the other two lorry trailers and their human cargo are believed to have made it safely into the UK.\n\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a Catholic priest from Nghe An, a province in Central Vietnam, said bereaved families have come forward to tell him that 100 people were making their way to Britain for a \u2018new life\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018In this case, there were many people, more than 100 people, on their way to a better life, but 39 died. A few families have confirmed the deaths of their relatives, who are the victims of this tragic journey.\u2019\n\nThe priest added: \u2018When I learned of the news of people who were on their way to the UK in search of a new life but [who] lost their lives instead \u2013 it\u2019s not just the district of Yen Than, but the whole country that is in sorrow. This is a tragedy the whole country has to bear.\u2019\n\nIt is now thought that as many as 25 of the 39 victims are Vietnamese and from the same impoverished coastal region of Yen Than.\n\nRelatives said several were going to work in nail salons.\n\nThe family of Pham Thi Tra My revealed she had sent heart-rending text messages as she was suffocating inside the container as it crossed the English Channel.\n\nThe 26-year-old, from rural Ha Thin in Central Vietnam, wrote: \u2018I\u2019m sorry Dad and Mom.\n\n\u2018The way I went overseas was not successful ... I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe. Mom, I am so sorry.\u2019\n\nHer father, Pham Van Thin, who lives in a hut with a corrugated tin roof and earns around \u00a3300 per month, yesterday said he and his wife, Nguyen Thi Phong, had scraped together \u00a330,000 to send their daughter to the West for a better life. \u2018I\u2019ve lost both my loved one and my money,\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Pham said the traffickers did not tell him how they would smuggle their daughter to the UK, but knew she had gone via China and France. \u2018The smugglers said that this was a safe route, that people would go by airplane, car.\n\n\u2018If I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,\u2019 he told CNN. Hoang Thi Thuong, from Nghe An province, fears her husband Nguyen Dinh Tu is also a victim. He paid \u00a311,000 to smugglers to get to Britain but has not been heard from since October 21.\n\nMs Hoang revealed he had been working illegally in Romania and Germany and had begged her for money to get to the UK.\n\nShe said: \u2018I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything.\n\n\u2018I know he was in that truck because I have relatives who are working over there [in the UK] who called me and told me.\n\n\u2018They were supposed to pick him up at the drop point but then they called and told me Tu was in that truck.\u2019\n\nFather-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, is also feared to have been in the ill-fated container.\n\nHis wife, Ta Thi Oanh, told Vietnamese media that he had called her last Tuesday afternoon to say he was on the truck going to Britain.\n\nHe asked her to call her parents and ask them to pray for him, but has not been heard of since. Mr Nam\u2019s father, Vo Ngoc Luyen, said: \u2018After reading information about the 39 people in the container in the UK, my family is extremely shocked. We are anxiously waiting for official information from the authorities.\u2019\n\nOthers who may be involved are Anna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, whose parents have set up an altar with her photograph at their home; Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, whose father received a call last week from a Vietnamese man saying \u2018something unexpected happened\u2019 and cousins Hung Nguyen, 33, and Hoang Van Tiep.\n\nTheir aunt posted photographs on social media in the hope that they might be found alive.\n\nThe refrigerated lorry container left the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on Tuesday afternoon, arriving at Purfleet Docks just after midnight on Wednesday.\n\nThe trailer is alleged to have been picked up by Mr Robinson at around 12.30am, before being driven to nearby Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays.\n\nAround 1.40am, ambulance and police services were called when bodies were discovered inside the trailer.\n\nIn an effort to gather more intelligence, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Passmore, of Essex Police, said any friends or relatives of victims who came forward would be granted an \u2018amnesty\u2019 from prosecution if they were in the UK illegally themselves.\n\n\u2018We will take no action whatsoever against an individual that comes forward,\u2019 he said. \u2018I want to engage as much as I can with the Vietnamese community.\n\n\u2018There may well be people who are here illegally who think they may have lost a loved one, and are frightened to come forward.\u2019\n\nHe spoke as the bodies of all 39 victims were removed from the lorry container at a secure location in Tilbury docks and taken to a mortuary at the Moorfield Hospital in nearby Chelmsford.\n\nPolice said that fingerprints of the deceased had been taken and sent to Vietnam for fast-track identification.\n\nVietHome, a British organisation which tries to help UK-based Vietnamese residents, said it had been sent 20 photographs and names of people feared to have been inside the lorry container.\n\nLast night, Thomas Maher, 38, the boss of a haulage company from Warrington, Cheshire, and his wife Joanna, 38, were in custody after being arrested in connection to the deaths.\n\nA 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland, who was arrested at Stansted Airport, also remains in custody.\n\nFederal police in Belgium are studying CCTV footage of the haulier who transported the 39 migrants into Zeebrugge site.\n\nIt has emerged that the driver was picked up by CCTV cameras ten times at the port.\n\nThree cars with personalised number plates belonging to Irish haulage boss and his wife, both 38, are seized by police as the couple are quizzed over Essex lorry migrant deaths\n\nPolice yesterday seized cars belonging to an Irish haulage boss and his wife who are being quizzed by detectives over the deaths of 39 migrants.\n\nThe vehicles \u2013 a white Chevrolet Corvette, grey Range Rover Sport and Discovery Sport with personalised number plates, and a Kawasaki motor bike \u2013 are owned by Thomas and Joanna Maher, both 38.\n\nThe couple were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people after a dramatic early morning raid on their \u00a3400,000 home in Warrington, Cheshire on Friday.\n\nCops yesterday (Sat) seized three expensive cars and a motorbike belonging to an Irish haulage company boss and his wife arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 immigrants\n\nThe vehicles - a white Chevrolet Corvette, and his-and-hers grey Range Rover Sport and Discovery Sport - are owned by Thomas and Joanna Maher, who remain in police custody\n\nThree flat-bed trucks with winches arrived at the property yesterday afternoon to remove the three cars and the lime green motorbike under the guidance of senior police officers.\n\nIt is understood the cars and bike will undergo forensic examination at an undisclosed location.\n\nMr Maher, a former lorry driver, is the director of two UK firms \u2013 Thomas Maher Transport (TMT) Ltd and a hairdressing salon called New Hair Don\u2019t Care.
