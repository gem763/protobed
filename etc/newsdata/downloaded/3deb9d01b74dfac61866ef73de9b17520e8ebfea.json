This is why the greatest investors in history, like billionaire mathematician Jim Simons, exploit short-term rather than long-dated mispricings where the ex ante probability of being right is higher because there is less scope for external events to perturb profits.\n\nIt is also why the oft-claimed distinction between \u201ctraders\u201d and \u201cinvestors\u201d is fallacious. All good traders and investors have a view on where fair value lies and seek to pick up assets trading at levels that deviate from it and which have a strong likelihood of mean-reverting.\n\nConsider two investors with the same talent exploiting the same quantum of mispricing on the same asset. Suppose the reasonable expectation for one is that the mispricing will close in a few hours while the other believes the mispricing will take weeks to normalise. Since uncertainty grows as a function of time, intelligent investors will always take the first trade rather than the second given it has a higher probability-weighted expected return.\n\nAnd yet I regularly come across individuals who think that those \u201cinvestors\u201d targeting long-holding periods (ie, most fund managers) are superior to \u201ctraders\u201d (like Simons and, in his own way, Kissinger) who relentlessly optimise opportunities over the short run.\n\nRBA forecasts\n\nAn unwitting adherent to Kissinger\u2019s doctrine is the Reserve Bank of Australia. My beloved Martin Place brethren are, to their credit, the first to admit they cannot forecast much, if anything, beyond 12 months despite the army of analysts at their disposal. When the RBA\u2019s board members meet each month, they have to make decisions based on the highly imperfect information they have available to them. As Glenn Stevens used to say, \u201cnowcasting\u201d (figuring out what is happening in the present) is more valuable than guessing about an unknowable future.\n\nWhen I played rugby for Victorian Schoolboys, our aphorism was \u201csmall steps\u201d. Chain those together and the game will look after itself. A similar maxim was adopted on the tennis court: focus on winning each individual point, and the games, sets and match will follow. Think too far ahead, and you can lose sight of the present.\n\nGovernor Phil Lowe knows that to meet his mandated through-the-cycle price stability and full employment goals, he has to use the full spectrum of tools to reduce the jobless rate from about 5.3 per cent towards the 4.0-4.5 per cent range the RBA estimates will exhaust excess labour supply without precipitating unruly wage pressures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, there are tail risks. But Lowe is correct when he argued during the week that the nascent housing recovery is not a concern. Even after my expected 10 per cent pop in prices through to June 2020, home values will not have increased for three years (given the 10 per cent decline between 2017 and 2019) while credit growth remains uninspiring.\n\nLowe, likewise, knows that the brilliant former professional tennis player-cum-Treasurer Joshua Frydenberg is not going to give him any loving with fiscal stimulus after delivering the first full-year budget surplus (on the \u201cnet operating balance\u201d and \u201cfiscal balance\u201d measures) since the crisis, as we forecast years ahead of other analysts. And \u201cJFry\u201d himself was right to forcefully submit this week that over-eager regulators should not apply Australia\u2019s asinine responsible lending laws in a way that fundamentally shifts the legal liability for repaying a loan from the borrower to the lender, as this column has argued on numerous occasions.\n\nOur banks have maintained among the lowest mortgage default rates in the world for many decades despite internationally high interest rates. There is just not a shred of evidence that there is any systematic irresponsible lending in the APRA-regulated domain. I cannot say the same for the non-banks, which is why we generally avoid securities issued by them.\n\nIn the last few months alone, two Australian non-bank lenders have defaulted on their \u201csenior\u201d bonds. And it is truly madness to think that Aussie banks could be buying non-bank bonds for their emergency liquidity books when the loans backing these securities are not subject to full APRA oversight. The bank trader wants to maximise his yields, but doing so undermines the integrity of the bank\u2019s liquidity book while bizarrely supporting its fierce non-bank rivals with funding!\n\nHigh-yield LITs\n\nOn the subject of the search for yield, one question I am regularly asked is whether retail investors should be switching from major bank hybrids, which have performed exceptionally well over the last 12 months, into the tsunami of high-yield listed investment trusts (LITs) that have been raising large amounts of money by paying brokers and advisers huge conflicted sales commissions of up to 2 per cent to 3 per cent of the capital they source from na\u00efve retail and wholesale investors.\n\nMajor bank hybrids have a BB+ credit rating, which puts them just below the cusp of the so-called investment grade band that runs from BBB to AAA. The new high-yield bond LITs often invest in US and European BB and B rated bonds or direct loans that have no rating at all.\n\nFive-year major bank hybrid credit spreads are paying about 2.7 per cent above the quarterly bank bill swap rate (BBSW). In the US, lower-rated BB high-yield bond credit spreads are trading at a lesser 2.4 per cent above the equivalent \u201cLibor\u201d benchmark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, on a like-for-like basis, US high-yield securities offer inferior returns. We are further forecasting that Standard & Poor\u2019s will upgrade the major banks\u2019 hybrids into the BBB- category where the average five-year credit spread is about 1.7 per cent above BBSW (or 100 basis points lower than what you get on major bank hybrids).\n\nGiven the recent hybrid rally, I have also been asked whether now is a good time to take profits. Well, yes, it might be. But not to switch into foreign high yield. The reduction in credit spreads on both major bank hybrids and BB rated US debt has been almost identical since their respective \u201cwides\u201d in late 2018.\n\nThere are other complications. One thing we avoid like the plague is buying high-yield debt from corporates with much higher internal business model risk than you get with large Aussie banks and insurers. Everyone knows the $143 billion bank CBA with its world-beating AA- credit rating. This presents a striking contrast with the largest exposure in one recent ASX LIT, the Brazilian oil company Petrobas, which carries a junk or high-yield credit rating of just BB-, some nine notches below CBA. I would personally much rather buy a BB+ rated security issued by CBA than a similarly rated instrument from Petrobas given the radically lower business risks the big Australian bank carries (as reflected in its vastly superior issuer rating).\n\nAnother problem is hedging costs. You used to be able to improve your total returns materially by hedging US fixed income into Aussie dollars \u2013nowadays doing so reduces your returns by more than 1 per cent annually because the RBA\u2019s cash rate is below, not above, the US Federal Reserve\u2019s cash rate. This unattractive risk and return trade-off is compounded by LITs\u2019 fees, which often add up to more than 1 per cent annually.\n\nThe LITs deal with this panoply of problems in three ways. First, they invest in even riskier bonds with much lower credit ratings than hybrids. Second, some assume larger interest-rate \"duration risk\" by allocating to fixed-rate bonds which, all else being equal, are far more volatile than similarly rated floating-rate hybrids. This means that in addition to credit risk, investors are adding on another source of capital loss, which is changes in long-term interest-rate expectations.\n\nA third return driver is leverage. The two most recent LITs have allowed themselves to use leverage of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the capital raised from mums and dads. One might counter that leveraging illiquid junk bonds issued by companies investors know nothing about is a recipe for disaster.\n\nA final consideration is relative value. Major bank hybrids are paying credit spreads that are about 2.7 times higher than they were before the global financial crisis in 2007 despite the fact that the major banks have more than halved the risk-weighted leverage on their balance sheets. In contrast, BB rated bonds in the US are trading on credit spreads that are lower than their mid 2007 levels, while corporate leverage has been increasing, not decreasing.\n\nThe author is a portfolio manager with Coolabah Capital Investments, which invests in fixed-income securities including those discussed by this column.
