Instagram/@rihanapetra\n\nDid anyone say divorce?\n\nThe mystery behind the Kelantan Sultan\u2019s marital status continues to deepen as his Russian wife has now appeared to rubbish rumours of their alleged divorce.\n\nWhile the Kelantan palace has never announced a marriage between Sultan Muhammad V and former beauty queen Rihana Oksana Petra (or Rihana Oksana Voevodina), it is widely acknowledged by the Malaysian public that the two are married and have a baby son together.\n\nEarly this week, rumours of a supposed divorce began swirling online. On Wednesday (July 17), Malaysian news outlets seemed to confirm these rumours, reporting that the 50-year-old king had divorced the 27-year-old via \u201ctriple talaq\u201d.\n\nRead also: Sultan Muhammad V allegedly divorced his Russian wife \u2013 and the Kelantan Palace is asking people not to call her Queen\n\nBut on Thursday (July 18), Rihana took to Instagram with an uncaptioned video centred on her marriage to the king.\n\nIn the video \u2013 which shows the couple locking hands in a romantic slow dance \u2013 Rihana says: \u201cI want to be the last person in his (the sultan\u2019s) life, and I want to live with him until the end of my life.\u201d\n\nThe king is then shown talking about his marriage to Rihana, espousing the virtues of patience and understanding in a relationship.\n\n\u201cThe two most important [things are] patience and understanding,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who say \u2018love, love\u2019. Yea, yea, fine, love is good. But after 15 to 20 years, the patience and understanding is (sic) going to overtake the love,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn another snippet, he says: \u201cEven though there\u2019s a lot of hobbies that we don\u2019t do together, there\u2019s a lot of understanding.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to family, Sultan Muhammad V says the top priority for him is \u201cchildren\u201d.\n\n\u201cNumber one has to be children. Because your children carry on your legacy,\u201d he says.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nView this post on Instagram \u2026 A post shared by Rihana Oksana Petra (@rihanapetra) on Jul 17, 2019 at 9:54am PDT\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - The video also shows the couple locking hands in a romantic slow dance..
