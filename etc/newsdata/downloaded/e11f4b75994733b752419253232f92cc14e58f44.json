The plan was not really for it to be a significant dress, really just to blend in with the train.\n\n'I suppose it's flattering. Embarrassing, definitely. The dress was meant to be insignificant,' she replied.\n\nHe then congratulated her on a cross-country cycle race she had recently completed for charity but asked what her inspiration was when her legs and 'bum' ached on the bike.\n\nHe also noted that he was glad she was able to 'sit' after spending so long on the bike.\n\nLauer did end up interviewing Pippa on air in 2014. It was her first television interview and she used it to promote her charity work but he asked about the attention she received from the wedding. It is unclear if the attempted recruiting came before or after their sit-down\n\nLauer, in a voice over, referred to Pippa as a 'beautiful woman in a very flattering dress'. She said she was embarrassed by the attention she received and that the dress was meant to 'blend in;\n\nPippa's shapely figure, and how her Alexander McQueen bridesmaid's dress complimented it, became a focal point of the wedding\n\nShe said she was shy in front of the camera and was 'embarrassed' when the world started talking about her behind.\n\nThat interview was recorded in London.\n\nAccording to Page Six's report, Lauer shut down his favorite Upper East Side restaurant when Pippa was in New York to talk about joining the network.\n\nShe was accompanied to the event by her then publicist, and NBC staffers were also present.\n\n'Pippa wasn\u2019t comfortable with any of it. Buckingham Palace was putting her under tremendous pressure not to go forward or cause any embarrassment to her sister.\n\n'Matt and Pippa were never alone, and she wasn\u2019t really interested in the job, but nevertheless NBC staffers were nervous about Matt\u2019s interest in Pippa,' one source told Page Six.\n\nLauer (pictured on Wednesday) has found himself back in the spotlight after living like a recluse for the last two years thanks to new allegations against him\n\nThe 51-year-old has angrily denied forcing women into sex and specifically said the anal sex one woman claimed was an assault was in fact a consensual act between two adults\n\nNBC declined to comment on the story when approached by DailyMail.com.\n\nLauer has been hiding out in the Hamptons for the last two years since he was fired at the height of the #MeToo movement over sexual misconduct claims.\n\nIn the last two weeks, his story alleged wrongdoings have resurfaced thanks to Ronan Farrow's new book, Catch and Kill.\n\nIn it, Farrow tells the story of Brooke Nevils, an NBC producer who had an affair with Lauer in 2014. She claims in the book for the first time that he anally raped her while the pair were in Sochi covering the Winter Olympics.\n\nLauer has angrily denied her allegation and says though he was unfaithful to his wife, he always had consensual sex with partners.\n\n", "description": "Lauer, who was fired from Today in 2017 amid sexual misconduct claims and who has since been accused of raping a woman he had an affair with, thought Pippa would become a good hire.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19807302-0-image-a-38_1571259027254.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
