Hassan Rouhani rallied the troops, literally, in demanding that the US and other Western nations exit the Persian Gulf region and leave it to Iran\u2019s tender mercies. Rouhani talked about the use of \u201cforeign troops\u201d while busily extending their reach through Syria to the Mediterranean, from where Western nations would like to keep Iran out too:\n\nIran\u2019s president called Sunday on Western powers to leave the security of the Persian Gulf to regional nations led by Tehran, criticizing a new U.S.-led coalition patrolling the region\u2019s waterways as nationwide parades showcased the Islamic Republic\u2019s military arsenal. \u2026 Rouhani said Iran was willing to \u201cextend the hand of friendship and brotherhood\u201d to Persian Gulf nations and was \u201ceven ready to forgive their past mistakes.\u201d \u201cThose who want to link the region\u2019s incidents to the Islamic Republic of Iran are lying like their past lies that have been revealed,\u201d the president said. \u201cIf they are truthful and really seek security in the region, they must not send weapons, fighter jets, bombs and dangerous arms to the region.\u201d Rouhani added that the U.S. and Western nations should \u201cdistance\u201d themselves from the region. \u201cYour presence has always been a calamity for this region and the farther you go from our region and our nations, the more security would come for our region,\u201d he said.\n\nRouhani plans to present a peace plan at his UN visit this week, but don\u2019t expect it to go anywhere. According to Politico, Iran wants the region to reorganize itself under Tehran\u2019s leadership, which is the same plan that the Shi\u2019ites have had for the last 1300 years or so. The Sunnis have a plan to make sure the Shi\u2019ites never succeed in doing so. Those are the \u201cpast mistakes\u201d that Iran proposes to forgive \u2026 once they do homage to the ayatollahs of Tehran, that is.\n\nNeedless to say, the Saudis are not going to jump at the opportunity to put themselves under Ali Khameini\u2019s thumb. Nor will they want the US and the West to exit the Middle East stage, not while Iran\u2019s shooting cruise missiles at their oil facilities. It\u2019s the kind of demand and proposal that even Rouhani has to know will generate laughs rather than handshakes. While the Arabian peninsula is not as strategic to the US as it used to be before we took the handcuffs off our own petroleum extraction, it\u2019s still strategic enough for us to retain a keen interest in isolating Iran\u2019s expansionist ambitions, which Rouhani apparently will be good enough to prove in his upcoming UN speech.\n\nRouhani\u2019s blowing smoke in more ways than one. If Rouhani wanted the US out of the region, he has his best opportunity in decades. Donald Trump is the first post-war non-interventionist president, the man who wants us to exit both sides of Iran \u2014 Iraq/Syria and Afghanistan \u2014 without a firm victory in either place. All Iran had to do was not act crazy, and they can\u2019t even do that long enough to let Trump order the US out of the region. Iran\u2019s actions in seizing ships and firing missiles make it impossible for Trump to retreat now.\n\nHowever, Iran isn\u2019t crazy, at least not in that sense. Their leadership caste truly believes in the Twelfth Imam prophecy and the worldwide conflagration that has to precede it. They want an Armageddon, only on their terms, in order to complete their non-rational ambitions of Shi\u2019ite Islamist global conquest. In that sense, they need the US as a part of that conflict, which is why Rouhani\u2019s talking out of both sides of his mouth.
