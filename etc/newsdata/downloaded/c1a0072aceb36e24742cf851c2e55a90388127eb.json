(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nCoach Jay Gruden said Monday that running back Derrius Guice \u2014 a second-round draft pick in 2018 who has yet to play a regular season game \u2014 could have an even larger role than expected in the Washington Redskins\u2019 offense.\n\nSeveral offensive mainstays were released Saturday, including running back Samaje Perine, known to be a favorite of Gruden\u2019s, and the coach said the presence of Guice was the biggest factor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much about Samaje as it is about Derrius Guice, how much faith we have in him to carry the ball,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe drafted him for a reason. We feel like he can be a first-, second- and even third-down back if needed. The offense, carries-wise, will probably go through him, pretty much.\u201d\n\nJosh Doctson also was cut Saturday as the Redskins decided to go younger at wide receiver. Gruden called the departures of Doctson and Perine \u201ca shame,\u201d but Doctson quickly landed a job, according to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, who reported Monday that Doctson was set to join the Minnesota Vikings. That reunites the 2016 first-round draft pick with former Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins.\n\n[Redskins Coach Jay Gruden: \u2018I\u2019m numb\u2019 to the Trent Williams holdout]\n\nGruden\u2019s evaluation of Guice was the biggest clue yet as to what the running game might look like. The question of how snaps will be allocated has yet to get a firm answer, although running backs coach Randy Jordan this summer predicted a 60-40 split one way or another between Guice and Adrian Peterson. Neither seemed to be the clear lead back in practice.\n\nThe Redskins want to run the ball and play great defense, so there will be plenty of carries to spread around in the season opener Sunday at the Philadelphia Eagles. Gruden\u2019s statement seemed to hint that Guice could be the focal point with Peterson in a backup role. Peterson ran for 1,042 yards and seven touchdowns in 2018 while Guice was sidelined with a torn ACL.\n\nIf Guice starts (and assuming Trent Williams continues his holdout), Washington will have new starters at quarterback, running back, X receiver, slot receiver, left tackle and left guard from the roster that began the 2018 season. The team committed to a youth movement at wide receiver with three rookies (Terry McLaurin, Kelvin Harmon and Steven Sims Jr.), second-year player Trey Quinn and Robert Davis, who has played one NFL game.\n\n[Redskins\u2019 2019 roster features a talented defense and big questions on offense]\n\nThe decision on Perine also makes sense in that the Redskins would have three physical, early-down backs to go with the all-purpose Chris Thompson. Keeping Byron Marshall, then replacing him with former Eagles running back Wendell Smallwood, brings someone else in that third-down mold who can be active in the return game.\n\n\u201cThey kind of couldn\u2019t get rid of me, in a sense,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to go play there. I\u2019m excited to go whup up on old teammates. \u2026 The D-line, the front seven is going to be physical. It\u2019s going to be a fistfight with those boys Sunday. I kind of let the guys know we\u2019re going to have to be physical.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins are still in limbo when it comes to tight end Jordan Reed and cornerback Fabian Moreau. Reed is in the concussion protocol, and Gruden was unsure about his availability against the Eagles. Gruden said the same about Moreau (ankle). Gruden pointed to Greg Stroman and rookie Jimmy Moreland as possible replacements for Moreau.\n\nThe team added former Eagles defensive lineman Treyvon Hester to take the 52nd spot on the roster Monday as insurance in case Caleb Brantley (foot) is unable to play Sunday. The Redskins filled out the last spot on their 53-man roster later Monday afternoon when they claimed linebacker Tanner Vallejo off waivers. The Bills spent a sixth-round pick on the Boise State product in 2017, and he played 15 games in Buffalo that year and 13 in Cleveland in 2018.\n\nMore Redskins:\n\nThe Redskins are already getting big contributions out of their rookie class\n\nRedskins sign former Eagles running back Wendell Smallwood, release Byron Marshall\n\nJosh Doctson highlights list of cuts as Redskins finalize roster", "description": "If Guice starts, and assuming Trent Williams continues his holdout, Washington will have new starters at quarterback, running back, X receiver, slot receiver, left tackle and left guard from the roster that started the 2018 season.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins", "September At Pm", "Kareem Copeland Is The Post'S Washington Redskins Beat Writer.
