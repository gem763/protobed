Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.\"\n\nAn SNP spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing \"this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible\".\n\nThe spokesperson said: \u201cIt is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards.\n\n\"We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson.\u201d\n\nEven with SNP support, it would come down to a knife-edge vote for Mr Corbyn. There are 288 Tory MPs, as well as 10 Democratic Unionists, so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs to come on board.\n\nLabour argued that the plan was the \"simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal\".\n\nHowever the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the House, as he would need the backing of ex-Tory MPs and defectors from his own party.\n\nKirstene Hair, Tory MP for Angus, said: \u201cThis report confirms what many have long suspected \u2013 SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No10.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Corbyn\u2019s weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists.\n\n\u201cHe has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister.\n\n\u201cOnly a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted \u2018No\u2019 in what was meant to be a once in a generation event.\u201d", "description": "The SNP has signalled it\u00a0could support installing Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street on a temporary basis\u00a0to thwart a no-deal Brexit.
