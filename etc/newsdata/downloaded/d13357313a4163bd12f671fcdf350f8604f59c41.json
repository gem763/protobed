Most of the items are now available for pre-order, though a few, such as the glasses, will be sold on an invite-only basis for now.\n\nGoogle GOOG The announcements come at a time when the popularity of smart speakers with virtual assistants has ballooned. According to data from tech market researcher Canalys, companies including Amazon,, and Baidu shipped 26.1 million smart speakers in the second quarter of this year. Amazon is sitting on top of this market and is working to keep its momentum.\n\nThe $59 Echo clock\n\nAs expected, the company introduced Echo Buds -- $130 earbuds with 5 hours of battery life and 20 hours via a rechargeable case. It uses Bose active noise reduction technology, can be turned on with a double tap and gives users access to Siri or Google Assistant, whichever is available on their smartphone. A feature lets users ask questions such as \"Where are canned tomatoes?\" in a Whole Foods location. The earbuds will respond with the aisle where you can find this product.\n\nBut the company didn't stop with earbuds. In an unexpected move, Amazon showed off Echo Frames, a set of eyeglasses with prescription lenses that features \"very discrete directional microphones\" that let only users hear Alexa. The glasses weigh about 31 grams -- lighter than, say, Google Glass -- and users can tap the stem to turn the virtual assistant off.\n\nRead More", "description": "At a major media event on Wednesday, Amazon introduced a wide range of new products and services in its continuing effort to usher its virtual assistant, Alexa, into every corner of the home and, now, on to every part of our body too.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925154001-amazon-event-dave-limp-echo-buds-0925-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
