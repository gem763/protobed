When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Yang was generally considered to be one of the more centrist candidates in the field.\n\nOwing to his outsider perspective, Yang was identified one of the least experienced candidates in the field by far when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Yang was in the middle of the pack.\n\nCould Andrew Yang beat Trump?\n\nYang is considered by Democrats who know of him to be a weaker candidate against President Trump, pulling projected to lose more often and win less often than a standard competitor.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Andrew Yang's qualifications?\n\nINSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications.
