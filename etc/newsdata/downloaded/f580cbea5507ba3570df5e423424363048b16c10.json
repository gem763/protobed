Not a bit of it.\n\n\u201cI think I will say that Eddie is a very clever man, he loves playing his mind games,\u201d said Lobbe, now Argentina\u2019s forwards coach. Jones was making the point that Argentina have gone away from the all-court style that took them to the last four again in 2015 and now rely heavily on a strong set piece and \u201cup to 30 kicks a game\u201d. No doubt it was also a comment he wanted Argentina to hear and perhaps tease a response from.\n\nScott Wisemantel rejects Creevy\u2019s \u2018pigeonholing\u2019 of England\u2019s style Read more\n\n\u201cHe is a very, very clever coach,\u201d added Lobbe. \u201cHe is definitely analysing us with the kick, [and] the ball in hand. We are just trying to use the best weapons we have to try and win the game.\u201d\n\nLobbe is certain Argentina have to win on Saturday. Mathematically they would not quite be eliminated if England make it 10 wins in a row against them but the former Pumas captain is under no illusions. \u201cIf we lose we are out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat helps. We are not going to hide it. It is a big game and we are going to prepare like it. We are just trying to use all the weapons we have. We know that in rugby in this type of competition and at this level defences are very tight so it is just about trying to get the best winning formula you can get and sometimes it is using kicks, sometimes it is ball in hand, sometimes it is just using the lineout, the drive and the scrums.\u201d\n\nBest-laid plans need to be flexible as Rugby World Cup reaches crunch time | Ben Ryan Read more\n\nBefore his side were beaten 45-7 by England, the USA head coach, Gary Gold, said he could see no weaknesses in Jones\u2019s side. Lobbe disagrees but acknowledged that their ball-carrying power is among their greatest strengths. Indeed, Maro Itoje confirmed on Wednesday that a bigger emphasis has been put on carrying in the England squad due to the conditions making handling difficult.\n\n\u201cI promise you, in any rugby team, if you get two or three guys who get over the advantage line every time then it is going to be the easiest game of your life,\u201d Lobbe said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way rugby is right now. If we get our go-forward men going forward for us it is much simpler to attack. If we stop them, it is much simpler to defend. Rugby nowadays is like that, it is all about those inches and that advantage line and it is about fronting up on Saturday.\n\n\u201cFour years ago when [Eddie] started he said he wanted a big English team. He said: \u2018I want a big set piece, a big defence and I want people running hard lines and going very straight and I want a good kicking game.\u2019 We can recognise all of those items in the English team and then they have a lot of good playmakers. I can stay here for a long time saying good things about the team we are playing on Saturday, but again I trust the boys that we have what it takes.\u201d", "description": "Juan Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez Lobbe says Eddie Jones is trying to play \u2018mind games\u2019 with his comments about Argentina", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b26963f512a6e0038d3a9a3b16168543503f326/0_34_4482_2689/master/4482.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3139694100e3fc6560e74fc5f035391"}
