Surfers floated in a line off the shore. It looked like any other California beach \u2014 except for the row of signs that warned \u201cNuclear Power Plant Exclusion Area,\u201d and the twin reactor domes rising above the bluffs.\n\nI was there to see the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, a shuttered nuclear power plant right next to the Pacific Ocean. It once supplied electricity to Southern California, but was permanently shut down in 2013. It\u2019s now scheduled to be dismantled, but even when that happens, more than 1,700 tons of spent nuclear fuel will remain \u2014 interred in enormous concrete casks behind a seawall. There\u2019s nowhere else to put it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the landscape now.\u201d\n\nOn the beach, perspectives on the plant ranged from resignation to frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the landscape now,\u201d said one man walking his dog. A woman who was roasting marshmallows in the sand with her family said it\u2019s eerie to see the plant when she\u2019s out surfing: \u201cYou turn around and take a wave, and you just see these nuclear boobs staring out at you.\u201d Her husband wondered what will happen with the spent nuclear fuel now that the plant is no longer operating. \u201cNo citizen wants it here permanently, but nobody wants to take it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re just in a really hard spot. What are you supposed to do with it?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a question that nuclear power plants around the country are reckoning with as low natural gas prices, costly repairs, and political pressure have driven a half dozen reactors to retire early since 2013, according to the Department of Energy. More are slated to shut down in the next ten years \u2014 including Diablo Canyon, California\u2019s last nuclear power plant, Rob Nikolewski reports for The San Diego Union-Tribune. That leaves communities that are no longer benefiting from nuclear power saddled with its waste \u2014 cooling off in gigantic pools of water made out of reinforced concrete or steel and concrete containers called dry storage.\n\nAll those containers of fuel left behind mean that no one can use the land for anything else. And the problem is widespread: spent fuel from commercial reactors is scattered across roughly 80 sites in 35 different states, according to the Government Accountability Office. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this: for decades, the plan has been to bury highly radioactive nuclear waste underground. (There were also proposals to bury the waste in the ocean or shoot it into the sun \u2014 but those weren\u2019t as practical, according to a report by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Future.)\n\nThe idea is that a geologic repository would keep the waste away from people as the radioactivity decays \u2014 which can take hundreds of thousands of years, depending on the material. In the 1980s, the government settled on Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the most likely spot and planned to start taking shipments of spent nuclear fuel in 1998. In return, the deal was that utilities \u2014 really, their customers \u2014 would start paying ahead into a fund that would cover the costs. But Nevada politicians like Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) hated what became known as the \u201cscrew Nevada bill,\u201d and the project has hit delay after delay ever since.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just in a really hard spot. What are you supposed to do with it?\u201d\n\nNow, utilities like Southern California Edison, which operated San Onofre, are stuck in a holding pattern: guarding the waste, and suing the government for billions of taxpayer dollars to pay for it. \u201cThe federal government has not fulfilled their obligation to come take the fuel from this plant site, or any commercial plant site,\u201d Ron Pontes, team manager of decommissioning environmental strategy at San Onofre, told me. \u201cSo, until they do so, the fuel is here and we are charged with taking care of it.\u201d\n\nVerge Science\u2019s video team and I went on a tour of the plant to see what it means to take care of that fuel. First, though, we had to get through security. That meant gearing up with hard hats and safety glasses, signing off that we hadn\u2019t had alcohol in past five hours, and taking our boots off to go through an airport-style security portal. Then came another stop to have our hands scanned and get buzzed through metal turnstiles and into the protected area.\n\nOnce staffed by roughly 2,200 people, there are now just a few hundred working on-site, including security personnel. And outside on the pavement encircled by metal fences, the place felt empty. Except for the seagulls, the sound of the waves, and the occasional concussive booms from the neighboring US Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, it was quiet.\n\nOur guide was Pontes, the decommissioning team manager, a white-haired 61-year-old in a blue button-up whose career started on nuclear submarines in the Navy. He led us into a dark, red metal building tangled with pipes and metal tubes, and then into an elevator. There were only four cryptic buttons for the floors labeled 9, 30, 50, and 70 \u2014 for the number of feet above sea level. We went to 70, the top of the structure housing the massive metal turbines. Those don\u2019t turn anymore: \u201cThe turbine is just so much iron now,\u201d Pontes says. \u201cIt serves no purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe turbine is just so much iron now. It serves no purpose.\u201d\n\nFrom there, we could look out to see a white buoy floating in the ocean, marking the end of massive tubes that sucked in seawater to cool the plant. The dome of the Unit 3 reactor building towered behind us. Powered up in the 1980s, Units 2 and 3 are mirror images of each other. (Unit 1 was dismantled in 2008.) Inside those grey concrete domes, uranium atoms split in a chain reaction to produce heat. \u201cThat\u2019s the business end of this operation,\u201d Pontes says. \u201cThat\u2019s where the heat is generated that is transmitted to the steam generators, makes steam to turn the turbines, which makes electricity for our customers.\u201d\n\nHe used present tense \u2014 but the plant hasn\u2019t made electricity in years. Not since a steam generator in the Unit 3 dome sprung a leak in 2012. These days, Southern California Edison is preparing to decommission the plant \u2014 a $4.4 billion process that\u2019s anticipated to take 20 years. First, though, they had to move the bundles of nuclear fuel rods from the reactor cores into Olympic-sized, steel-lined cooling pools. (We didn\u2019t get to see them, but Pontes says that the crystal-clear water looks \u201cvery inviting to swim in.\u201d)\n\nBy the middle of 2019, the plan is to shift all of the fuel into steel containers encased in massive concrete blocks. Called dry storage, it\u2019s air-cooled so it\u2019s lower maintenance than the pools: it\u2019s designed to keep the radioactive fuel from overheating without using water, pumps, or electricity. These concrete monoliths are supposed to hold up against floods, earthquakes, tornadoes \u2014 even an airplane collision, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The dry storage comes in two flavors on the San Onofre site: in one, the canisters stand up vertically in the steel-lined cavities of a massive concrete block; in another, they slide in horizontally, like corpses into a nuclear morgue.\n\nWith so few people at the plant, nature was making a comeback: on our way to the dry storage, our security escort had to hang back to call in a swarm of bees that had colonized a piece of equipment. Pontes imagined what the future of the plant will look like, when it\u2019s finally decommissioned. \u201cAt the end of the day, all that\u2019s left here is the dry storage facility and the security officers that will be monitoring this facility,\u201d he said. And both could be there for awhile.\n\nA swarm of bees had colonized a piece of equipment\n\nThere are a few possible fixes. Two different private companies have applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for licenses to construct interim storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico. But the key word there is interim: these sites would be temporary holding areas for fuel that will eventually move to a permanent repository \u2014 like Yucca Mountain, the controversial site in Nevada that\u2019s about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, and across the state line from Death Valley in California.\n\nAt first, the list of possible long-term repositories for highly radioactive waste was longer than just Yucca Mountain. Hanford in Washington state and Deaf Smith County in Texas also rose to the top, according to a report by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Future. Plus, there were supposed to be two repositories, so that one state wouldn\u2019t be stuck with an entire nation\u2019s nuclear waste. \u201cAnd then the idea was you couldn\u2019t do this quick and dirty, you\u2019d spend several years and a billion dollars at each of those three sites,\u201d says Robert Halstead, executive director of Nevada\u2019s Agency for Nuclear Projects.\n\nBut the selection process dragged out, grew expensive, and none of those states were happy about being at the top of that particular list. So in 1987, Congress decided to just pick one site for the DOE to investigate: Yucca Mountain. The DOE \u201cput a five-mile tunnel through the mountain, and did the science, and concluded this is a good place,\u201d says Lake Barrett, who headed up the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management at the time, and is now retired. He called it \u201cthe most studied piece of real estate on Earth.\u201d\n\nNevada objected to the DOE\u2019s conclusions \u2014 but Congress overrode that veto and in 2002, Congress and the president gave the DOE their blessing to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, for a license to start construction. Pretty much as soon as the NRC began officially reviewing the application in 2008, the whole thing started grinding to a halt.\n\n\u201cThe most studied piece of real estate on Earth.\u201d\n\nBy then, Harry Reid (D-NV) was the Senate majority leader \u2014 and he opposed shoving \u201cnuclear waste down a community\u2019s throat,\u201d he said in a statement in 2015. Barack Obama had campaigned on promises to prevent Yucca Mountain from opening, and once he took office, the funding for it dried up. After the DOE tried unsuccessfully to withdraw its licensing application in 2010, the operation mostly shut down. \u201cPeople who used to work for me, they were all laid off,\u201d Barrett says.\n\nSince then, the NRC\u2019s technical staff completed part of the licensing process when it issued its safety evaluation report in 2015. But the commission hasn\u2019t restarted the hearings necessary to weigh stakeholder concerns about the project \u2014 and it would need to, if Yucca Mountain were ever to become a nuclear waste repository. Now, a bill introduced by John Shimkus (R-IL) that passed the House in May proposes to clear the way for the licensing to proceed and would authorize interim storage facilities. It would let Nevada negotiate compensation in return for hosting the repository, ensure the DOE has the land rights it needs for the site, and increase the amount of waste that could be stored in the Yucca Mountain repository.\n\nThe bill probably won\u2019t get anywhere. \u201cHistorically, the Senate\u2019s not going to move,\u201d Shimkus said in an interview with The Verge. Senator Dean Heller (R-NV) called the bill \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the Senate. But Shimkus says the bill shows the House\u2019s collective support for funding Yucca Mountain. That\u2019s key as the House and the Senate haggle over the budget for fiscal year 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see how this final dance happens,\u201d Shimkus says.\n\nHalstead, over at Nevada\u2019s Agency for Nuclear Projects, said, \u201cThe bill is a declaration of war on the state of Nevada.\u201d There are two big things wrong with it, according to Halstead: \u201cThey think that they can force this down Nevada\u2019s throat, and they\u2019re not going to be able to \u2014 and secondly, they think the Department Of Energy can carry out the program,\u201d he says, adding that the state of Nevada can \u201cwhup the Department of Energy. So bring it on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think that they can force this down Nevada\u2019s throat.\u201d\n\nNevada\u2019s skepticism about Yucca Mountain is understandable, says Rod Ewing, a professor of geological sciences at Stanford University. For one thing, there were some 100 nuclear devices exploded in the air above Nevada. \u201cThey were told it was safe. Didn\u2019t turn out quite that way,\u201d he says. Plus, Ewing says, \u201cThey don\u2019t have nuclear power plants, but you\u2019re asking them to take the waste?\u201d\n\nYucca Mountain wouldn\u2019t be his first choice for a repository, either. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not safe,\u201d Ewing says. But he also argues that it doesn\u2019t \u201csatisfy the common sense requirements of a geologic repository.\u201d For example, in the 1990s, scientists found signs that water may percolate through the rock faster than expected. And the most likely way for radiation to escape the repository would be by hitching a ride with flowing water.\n\nBut other research groups have had trouble replicating those results. And Barrett pushes back, saying that very little water flows, it won\u2019t get into rivers or the ocean, and the waste containers are designed to prevent what goes into Yucca Mountain from getting out. \u201cYou can make these arguments to justify whatever your political motivation might happen to be,\u201d Barrett says.\n\nThe thing is, we know that progress toward an underground nuclear repository is possible \u2014 just look at Finland, which could start filling its underground repository with waste in the next decade, according to Timo \u00c4ik\u00e4s, a retired geologist who worked on the project. And \u00c4ik\u00e4s has an idea about why it\u2019s so far ahead. There are a few hurdles to clear in order to build a geologic repository, he says. The first is to make sure the site is safe. \u201cToday, in all countries which have operated nuclear power stations for several decades, there is lots of knowledge about these safety requirements,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe program is running, and running, and running, and nothing happens.\u201d\n\nThe second, \u201cwhich is much more tricky,\u201d \u00c4ik\u00e4s says, is convincing people to accept it. And that\u2019s where other countries have stalled. \u201cEverything boils down to trust,\u201d \u00c4ik\u00e4s says. Without it, he says, \u201cthere will be no decisions, or the decisions will be postponed \u2014 and then the program is running, and running, and running, and nothing happens.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening here in the US, and it\u2019s getting to the point where the government has to make a call about Yucca Mountain, because the clock is ticking, Shimkus says. \u201cIf the decision is that it\u2019s not safe, then we have to start the process all over again \u2014 that means another 30 years and another, at minimum, $15 billion,\u201d Shimkus says.\n\nUntil Yucca Mountain, interim storage, or an entirely new site are ready, the waste is going to sit where it was generated. None of the experts I spoke to are worried that radioactive fuel in dry storage could endanger people nearby. \u201cThere have not been any leaks of radiation from a dry cask in this country,\u201d Neil Sheehan, a spokesperson for the NRC, said in an email.\n\nBut recent mishaps at San Onofre have sparked local concerns. A loose pin in a new type of fuel canister raised alarm bells about faulty manufacturing. Southern California Edison stopped using those particular containers, and there have been no signs of trouble in the few that had already been filled with waste, Southern California Edison spokesperson Julie Holt told me. More recently, another fuel canister jammed on its way down into the concrete vault and could have fallen, Rob Nikolewski at the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. \u201cIf this had occurred, it would not have created a hazard to the public or employees,\u201d Tom Palmisano, vice president of decommissioning, said in a letter that was shared with The Verge.\n\n\u201cWe agree that it\u2019s better to move the fuel away from this site, okay?\u201d\n\nStill, the presiding sentiment among the people I spoke to is that keeping the waste at San Onofre, or any other plants across the country, is not a workable long-term plan. \u201cThe challenges here over the long term, the very long term, is that the sea level is rising,\u201d Pontes, our guide at the San Onofre plant, said to us in front of one of the dry storage blocks that stretched toward the sandy bluffs. That means that eventually, the fuel might have to move to higher ground. \u201cWe agree that it\u2019s better to move the fuel away from this site, okay?\u201d he said. \u201cBut, while it\u2019s here, we will fulfill our obligation to manage it safely.\u201d\n\nPontes took us to the top of the newest dry storage monolith \u2014 the one where the canisters sit upright, and circulate air through chimney-like vents. We weren\u2019t allowed next to the canisters with fuel in them. Those were blocked off by rope, and radiated heat in shimmering waves. Eventually, there will be 73 filled spent fuel canisters encased in concrete, plus two containers that will be left empty. One of those will be heated to mimic the presence of fuel, to monitor how the canisters weather over years in the salty air.\n\nPontes walked us along the line of concrete lids for the empty fuel containers, and told us how robust the system is: three feet of reinforced concrete in the foundation. Two feet of reinforced concrete at the top. And sandwiched in between? More concrete. I wondered what that meant for earthquakes \u2014 and Pontes told me that the concrete block is supposed to withstand even bigger earthquakes than the plant was designed to take. What about tsunamis? \u201cThe analyzed tsunami is much lower than the seawall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this were to be swamped, you could have 125 feet of water above the top of these cylinders.\u201d After a flood, they\u2019d pump out the water, clean off the canisters, and continue operating, he said.\n\n\u201cEventually, it becomes untenable,\u201d\n\nBut nature is coming for the spent fuel canisters in ways their designers may not have anticipated \u2014 in the form of seagulls, and their poop. When the plant was operating, the seagulls liked to nest on the warm containment buildings, Pontes says. \u201cOnce we shut down and there were fewer people on-site and less activity, they seem to have returned \u2014 in a big way.\u201d\n\nNow, the dry storage lids are splattered with droppings. To be clear, the poop won\u2019t endanger the fuel. But to keep the birds from getting too comfortable, fake coyotes stand guard amid the canisters of nuclear waste and snarl from the tops of plastic traffic cones. They\u2019re keeping the dry storage as seagull-free as they can until the Department of Energy is ready to pick up the fuel. Pontes thinks that will have to happen, one day: \u201cEventually, it becomes untenable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem that we have with this fuel being here is a problem that exists almost everywhere.\u201d\n\nOn our way out of the plant, we ran a Geiger counter over our hands and feet. It clicked as it checked us for radiation. We were fine.", "description": "The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station once supplied electricity to Southern California.
