Hours into the hearing, a nasty argument broke out between Democrats and Republicans over whether Mr. Berke, who is an outside consultant to the Judiciary panel, should be allowed to question Mr. Lewandowski in the hour allotted to staff lawyers for each side.\n\nRepublicans balked, using parliamentary maneuvers to try to derail the move, but majority Democrats easily dispensed with their objections, and that of Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s lawyer, who commandeered a microphone at the witness table to register his opposition.\n\nThe episode enraged Republicans, who called it a blatant violation of committee rules. Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the panel\u2019s ranking member, at one point stormed out of the hearing in protest. When he returned, he said his side would not have a staff lawyer question Mr. Lewandowski, and the session was adjourned.", "description": "Mr. Lewandowski, President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, testified before lawmakers conducting an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/us/politics/17dc-lewandowski-briefing-promo/17dc-lewandowski-briefing-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
