The tears, in-house drama, feelings and bleeps are all as genuine as they would be if there weren't any cameras around.\"\n\nBut it's not always good vibes in the mansion, as he sometimes struggles to keep his composure when ladies are sent home without a rose: \"Some of them are really heartbroken which is very hard to see. I'm a hugger!\"\n\nAbout the new season, he says that he is particularly looking forward to seeing how new bachelor, Marc Buckner will handle dating several women at once.\n\nALSO READ: SA's new Bachelor Marc Buckner on dating IRL and finding love on TV\n\nWhen season two starts filming, Jason and The Bachelor crew hit the ground running, and it's sometimes hard to fit 24 hours in one day.

I then head back afterwards while the bachelor has a one-on-one with the lady of his choosing from the group date,\" he explains.\n\n\"If we are shooting a rose ceremony and cocktail evening, then I get up early, go to the gym, and have an afternoon rest, before heading to the mansion at 16:00, to start the cocktail evening by 19:00,\" he elaborates.\n\nThere is also an element of TV magic as the time-lapse we see on TV, doesn't always reflect reality. \"Filming can go into the early hours of the morning, and it can be exhausting,\" he says.\n\nWhen he has a day off, Jason enjoys spending time with his family and tries to make up for the times he works irregular hours.\n\nJason Greer, who is represented by Talent-ETC Artist Management, says the career path isn't for everyone, saying: \"It takes a lot of time, determination, dedication and, to be honest, natural-born talent.\"\n\n\"I'm so modest,\" he laughs.\n\nHe adds: \"Be prepared for rejection and constructive criticism. It's so important that you use those to become better! If it's what you want to do and it's your dream, persevere.\"\n\nALSO READ: From riding a motorcycle to chopping wood - 7 photos of SA's new Bachelor\n\nCompiled by Graye Morkel", "description": "Before the filming of the new season gets underway, Channel24 caught up with Jason and learned some exciting onset secrets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8605/8f222324583f4fb08f6c27f953bc8680.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
