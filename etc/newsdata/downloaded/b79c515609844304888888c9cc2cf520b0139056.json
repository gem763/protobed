She didn\u2019t notice a drinking fountain in a galley area five rows behind her.\n\nJustice Jacinta Forbes found Di Falco\u2019s requests for water \u201cwere not refused, merely deferred to later.\u201d\n\nThe judge found that the airline was not liable under the Montreal Convention, which sets out compensation rules for victims of air disasters, because \u201cnothing unusual or unexpected\u201d occurred during the flight that would meet the definition of an \u201caccident.\u201d\n\nEmirates did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nCabin crew supervisor Leon van der Plas testified during the trial that passengers faint two or three times a week. Two weeks rarely passed without at least one passenger fainting, he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A passenger who said she was left thirsty by an Emirates cabin crew and broke her ankle when she fainted on the flight lost her case in an Australian court on Tuesday for compensation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rod Mcguirk"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
