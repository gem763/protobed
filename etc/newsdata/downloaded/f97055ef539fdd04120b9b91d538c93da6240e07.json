My name is James South. I am a proud WWII veteran! I will be turning 100 on October 7th, 2019. I would like to receive 100 birthday cards,\u201d the sign read.\n\nOn Monday, he received more than 60,000 birthday cards and gifts that arrived at the facility from people as far away as Australia and India.\n\nSouth was born into a family of sharecroppers in northeast Texas and joined the United States Army in 1940. He was deployed to Normandy, France, just seven days after the D-Day invasion, his son, Jim South, told CNN.\n\nSince his retirement at age 65, South enjoys woodworking, tending his garden, playing golf, and going to church.\n\nHis son told reporters that he plans to celebrate his father\u2019s big day by playing golf and eating chicken fried steak and catfish at his favorite restaurants.\n\n\u201cMy dad taught me that a hug is better then a handshake,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that money wasn\u2019t the goal in life \u2014 it was happiness.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Eline de Bruijn, a digital producer at NBC DFW, posted photos to Twitter of South receiving congratulatory handshakes and holding one of his many special cards:\n\nHappy 100th birthday, James South! He's a World War II veteran. His birthday wish was 100 birthday cards. The internet heard him loud and clear \u2014 and mailed him more than 60K cards and gifts from around the world\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude2d https://t.co/fLuZsVMawj pic.twitter.com/jQXcpmXcNo \u2014 Eline de Bruijn (@debruijneline) October 7, 2019\n\nOn September 28, Breitbart News reported that South\u2019s idea to ask for birthday cards stemmed from his time in the military when his girlfriend, who eventually became his wife, wrote him letters on a daily basis the entire time they were apart.\n\n\u201cIt would give me a feeling that I am recognized for what I do, what I am,\u201d the veteran said. \u201cAnd I would cherish it forever.\u201d\n\nSo far, South has received over 500 well wishes on the initial post, which has been shared 3,800 times.", "description": "A World War II veteran in Texas who asked for 100 birthday cards for his 100th birthday got a huge surprise on Monday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/James-South-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
