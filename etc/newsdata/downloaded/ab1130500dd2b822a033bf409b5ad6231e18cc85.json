It came from a ProPublica report on unusual discrepancies in the Trump Organization\u2019s finances. Those revelations, in turn, show why the 2020 election\u2014as well as the prospect of impeachment\u2014are such a threat to not just his political future, but his personal one as well.\n\nTrump\u2019s business empire is privately owned by him and his family, so it\u2019s not required by law to disclose the same level of financial information as a publicly traded company. But there are certain institutions to which it must tell the truth. When seeking loans from banks and other lenders, the Trump Organization is required to show that it makes enough money to repay the debts. When filing state and federal taxes, the company is legally obligated to provide similar details so agencies can tell whether it\u2019s paying the correct amount.\n\nWhat ProPublica found is that someone doesn\u2019t seem to be getting the right information from the president\u2019s company. The Trump Organization, for instance, told local tax officials that one of its Manhattan leases brought in $822,000 in revenue in 2017 while telling lenders that it had brought in $1.67 million that same year. \u201cIn eight years of data ProPublica examined for the Columbus Circle property,\u201d the news outlet reported, \u201cTrump\u2019s company reported gross income to tax authorities that was typically only about 81% of what it reported to the lender.\u201d Similar discrepancies can be found at other properties, according to ProPublica\u2019s reporting.\n\nThose differences don\u2019t prove bank fraud or tax fraud on their own, of course. But they certainly fit within a larger pattern. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, told Congress in February that the president had \u201cdeflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes\u201d in the past. Trump also used what The New York Times described as \u201cdubious tax schemes\u201d and \u201cinstances of outright fraud\u201d to funnel more than $400 million from his parents to himself in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During that same time period, he reported such massive business losses to the IRS\u2014more than $1.7 billion in all\u2014that he didn\u2019t pay income taxes for most of the decade-long stretch. Something isn\u2019t adding up.", "description": "This week provides a fresh reminder that the president may need to stay in office to stay out of the courtroom.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/dc16d4148591de424f0d7f3aada0febbaa83508c.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
