REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. customs officials are seeking information on facial recognition software for body-worn cameras that agents who police the border could use, according to a government filing.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) posted a request for information on body cameras, cloud storage and video management software that could help agents in remote outposts as they check for contraband and for immigrants entering the country illegally. The exploratory filing does not oblige the United States to move forward with the program.\n\nThe request listed features that CBP deemed critical, such as encryption and high-definition video, and it added facial recognition as a non-required item of \u201cpotential interest.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, CBP sought information on whether the ability to check faces against a database was currently available or when it would be operational - or even why a vendor chose to forgo the technology entirely.\n\nThe CBP\u2019s request underscores growing interest in facial recognition by law enforcement in the United States, just as the technology has come under heavy scrutiny.\n\nThis month, California\u2019s governor signed a bill into law that bans state and local law enforcement from using body cameras with facial recognition software for three years, one of several recent curbs on technology that some say poses a threat to civil liberties.\n\n\u201cBody cameras were promised to communities as a tool for officer accountability and should not be twisted into surveillance systems to be used against communities,\u201d Chris Rickerd, senior policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in response to the CBP filing.\n\nResponses to CBP's request for information are due on Oct. 31, according to the Federal Business Opportunities here website.", "description": "U.S. customs officials are seeking information on facial recognition software for body-worn cameras that agents who police the border could use, according to a government filing.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Dastin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442085525&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H00F", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
