He said a group of people they suspected to be Indonesian authorities were watching the building through binoculars, and were \u201crunning around\u201d.\n\nAn East Java police spokesperson, Frans Barung Mangera, told the Guardian the police were investigating the incident to determine who was \u201cdeliberately spreading terror\u201d and confirmed the dormitory was being guarded by police.\n\nIt was not clear if police were guarding the building when the motorcyclists came by.\n\nStudents have told the Guardian they feel the police presence is a form of intimidation.\n\nIt is not the first time snakes have been used to intimidate West Papuans. In February a UN panel of experts called for investigations into violence, unlawful arrest and mistreatment, after video emerged of police using a large snake to terrorise a handcuffed Papuan teenage boy.\n\nNews of the dawn intimidation comes days after reports emerged that an Indonesian student activist, Surya Anta, was being detained in an isolated cell at the Mako Brimob detention centre where nationalist songs, including the national anthem, were played throughout the day.\n\nThe pro-Papuan activist was arrested with seven Papuan students for allegedly raising the Morning Star flag, a symbol of Papuan independence, at a protest in front of the state palace in Jakarta. Police say they are now facing charges of treason.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest West Papuan students say shortly after 4am Monday four people on two motorcycles pulled up and threw two bags of snakes into their dormitory.\n\nIn recent days activists have also claimed that security forces in the Papuan capital of Jayapura have conducted nightly raids on student dormitories, leaving students frightened and traumatised, while other Papuan students have complained of being subject to heavy surveillance and intimidation by authorities.\n\nAt least six people are believed to have been killed and dozens arrested in clashes between protesters and police in Papuan towns in recent weeks.\n\nIndonesian authorities deployed extra police and military personnel into the region, and shut down internet, as demonstrations turned violent.\n\nA number of students were reportedly shot by militia groups, and footage of soldiers firing on protesters emerged last month.\n\nFootage of protests seen by the Guardian also appeared to show pro-Indonesian militia marching, carrying Indonesian flags and weapons. Indonesian military personnel are seen in some clips, walking among the militia.\n\nMuch of the information from the Papua protests has come through the Indonesian human rights lawyer Veronica Koman, who Indonesian authorities have since named as a \u201csuspect\u201d in the spreading of \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nOn Saturday East Java police said they had issued a warrant for Koman.\n\nThe chief of the East Java regional police Insp Gen Luki Hermawan, told Antara news police had visited her family\u2019s house, and were working with state intelligence, government ministries and the immigration department.\n\nPolice have cited Koman\u2019s posts about an August incident in Surabaya when military and nationalist militia were captured on video calling Papuan students \u201cmonkeys\u201d and \u201cdogs\u201d.\n\nShe faces up to six years jail if found guilty on charges under the country\u2019s controversial electronic information and transactions law.", "description": "Masked motorcycle riders pull up around 4am at East Java building that has been the target of protests", "authors": ["Helen Davidson", "Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f8609cebb3c520f0663cc0ebd09aa6904999a33/0_263_585_351/master/585.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=beae0ae2121745b7eb8f1bdbc9481fb7", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
