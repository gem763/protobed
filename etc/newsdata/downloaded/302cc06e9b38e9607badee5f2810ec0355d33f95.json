That vessel was released in August.\n\nThe Stena has set a new destination for Port Rashid in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, about 250km (155 miles) away, the tracking data showed. At normal tanker speed, it would reach the port within half a day.\n\nA spokesman for the ship\u2019s owner, Stena Bulk of Sweden, said on Friday that the vessel was preparing to leave.\n\nMarineTraffic.com, citing satellite data, showed the Stena Impero just outside the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas Friday morning, where it had been held since being seized by Iran on 19 July. There was no immediate comment from Iranian authorities.\n\nThe data showed the ship was stationary at 8:18am local time (4:48am GMT).\n\nIran says UK-flagged tanker seized in July is free to leave Read more\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry had said on Wednesday that a lifting of the detention order had been finalised, but that an investigation into the vessel was ongoing.\n\nThe ship\u2019s owner, Stena Bulk of Sweden, later said it was not in negotiations with Iran and was not aware of any formal charges against the crew or the company.\n\nIran had earlier freed seven of the ship\u2019s 23 crew members.\n\nIran\u2019s seizure of the Stena Impero on 19 July had ratcheted up tensions in the region following attacks in May and June on other merchant vessels in Gulf waters which Washington blamed on Tehran. Iran has denied responsibility.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have become more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact to rein in Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme and imposed sanctions on the country aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.\n\nReuters and Associated Press\n\n\n\n", "description": "Stena Impero, which was detained in July, has set a course for Dubai after Iranian officials announced it could be released", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c64a656e8a11ea5a67e74ca5cfcff13199ad816/0_154_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7416f63e0801ce76f02c9b6cc3c81141", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
