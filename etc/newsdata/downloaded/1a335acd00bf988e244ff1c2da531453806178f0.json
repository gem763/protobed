You won\u2019t want to let the clock run out on this.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on here?\n\nWe\u2019ll answer that question in today\u2019s Digest.\n\nAs we\u2019ve been noting in recent Digests, we\u2019re seeing increasing storm clouds out on the horizon. However, in the nearer-term, we believe there\u2019s a strong case to be made for a significant push higher in U.S. stocks. And practically no one is more bullish on stocks now that Louis Navellier.\n\nToday, we\u2019ll get into why, and then we\u2019ll reveal two additional, specific weeks in 2019 that Louis believes will be great times to put more money to work in the stock market.\n\nLet\u2019s jump in.\n\n***The wealth of the world is flowing toward the U.S.\n\nLouis Navellier is a Wall Street legend, having one of the best long-term records of any analyst in the business. This isn\u2019t hyperbole. Here\u2019s a snapshot of some of Louis\u2019 top winners from his Breakthrough Stocks newsletter.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind much of Louis\u2019 success is the fact that he\u2019s a numbers guy. He ignores the market chatter and gossip, and focuses on cold, objective metrics \u2014 the ones that drive corporate profitability \u2026 which translates into rising stock prices.\n\nToday, there\u2019s plenty of market chatter and gossip, but Louis is still focusing on numbers, and he\u2019s still seeing gains to come.\n\nHe just wrote to his subscribers, explaining why he\u2019s so bullish at the moment. Here\u2019s the top-line takeaway:\n\n\u2026 the S&P 500 continues to yield more than the 10-year Treasury \u2014 and that remains a screaming buy signal.\n\nIf you\u2019re less aware of why this is a screaming buy signal, first, remember that a great many investors are in the market not necessarily for capital gains through stocks, but for income \u2014 typically through bonds. Historically, bonds have provided income investors better yields than stock dividends.\n\nBut the markets have flipped upside down today.\n\nNot only does the S&P yield more than the 10-year Treasury, but a few days ago it yielded more than the 30-year Treasury. You can see how rare this is in the chart below.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time this has happened since March of 2009.\n\nSo, what does this really mean, and why is it bullish for stocks?\n\nWell, if you can get an annual yield from a company that\u2019s going to pay you more than the 30-year Treasury, and the company is strong with a history of raising its dividend, it\u2019s more attractive to income investors than a bond would be. And that\u2019s going to pull more money out of bonds, and into stocks, which will push stock prices higher.\n\nJonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse put it this way:\n\nStocks are almost a no brainer here. You\u2019ve got 70 percent of the S&P 500 trading with a higher yield than 10-year Treasury. That\u2019s very rare. So now people are saying let\u2019s go into stocks for income.\n\n***But what about the yield curve inversion? Aren\u2019t the low bond yields behind the inversion a sign of near-term danger?\n\nFirst, as we\u2019ve noted in the Digest, after an inversion, stocks historically rise before there\u2019s fallout in the broader economy. So, while an inversion can signal trouble, it\u2019s important to remember the timing involved.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Louis Navellier says we're in a stock-buying window \u2026 but you need to act soon before it closes \u2026 the inverted yield curve has made Louis MORE bullishSeptember 16 \u2026 that's when the \"stock-buying window\" will close.Right now, famed growth investor, Louis Navellier believes we're", "authors": ["Jeff Remsburg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JsxJVynAHkdmjHx2nRgRKQ--~B/aD0zMjI7dz01NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/4486c5c685fa0bb3b73d584ca6e5767a", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
