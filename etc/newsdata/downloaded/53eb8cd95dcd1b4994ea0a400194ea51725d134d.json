The brief letter, written in a highly colloquial style, was sent to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 9, days after Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces in the area, clearing the way for the long-threatened incursion by Turkey.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Trump had already drawn staunch bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers, who said the U.S. withdrawal meant abandoning U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria. Mr. Trump has argued that he doesn\u2019t want U.S. troops to be in the middle of a longstanding feud between Turkey and Kurdish fighters, but also threatened debilitating sanctions against Ankara.\n\nRead the Full Letter to Erdogan VIEW Document A copy of the letter dated Oct. 9. 2019, sent from President Donald Trump to Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy\u2014and I will,\u201d the letter begins. He also reminded Mr. Erdogan of now-lifted sanctions tied to the detention of American Andrew Brunson, warning: \u201cI\u2019ve already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson.\u201d He adds: \u201cDon\u2019t let the world down. You can make a great deal.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, he says that Kurdish commander Mazloum Abdi is willing to negotiate and to make concessions to end the violence.\n\n\u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way,\u201d he concludes. \u201cIt will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool.\u201d\n\nMr. Erdogan first informed Mr. Trump in an Oct. 6 phone call that he intended to go ahead with his long-threatened plans to launch a cross-border military operation in northeastern Syria. Mr. Trump immediately announced that he would withdraw U.S. forces from the area, releasing a statement late Sunday night.\n\nMr. Trump has dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence to Ankara to urge Mr. Erdogan to stop the weeklong military incursion. Mr. Trump disclosed the existence of the letter earlier Wednesday in remarks to reporters at the White House.\n\nIn comments from the Oval Office, President Trump stood by his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Syrian border, and said it was up to other countries to fight ISIS now.
