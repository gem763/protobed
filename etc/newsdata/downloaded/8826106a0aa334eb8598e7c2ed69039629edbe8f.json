Hell, my main phone, work laptop, home computer, and primary media player are all made by the Cupertino-based company. I\u2019m enveloped by Apple.\n\nWhile I grew up using Windows devices, I entered the Apple ecosystem at a time everything they made felt superior and slicker to Microsoft. But that was over 15 years ago. And although I\u2019ll probably never separate myself entirely from Apple hardware, it\u2019s harder than ever to ignore what Microsoft is doing \u2014 especially considering last night\u2019s Surface event.\n\nAnd, as an Apple fan, I don\u2019t know how to feel about it all. Excited? Dejected? Annoyed? Contented? I guess there\u2019s only one way to find out.\n\nThe laptops\n\nThe Macbook hasn\u2019t been in a great place recently. Whether it\u2019s battery problems, or the continuing keyboard issues, the once proud king of laptops is now looking rather senile and shaky. Hell, I\u2019m not entirely sure whether I\u2019d trust spending a couple grand on a Macbook and trusting it to last me five or six years anymore. Which should say it all.\n\nBut \u2014 and here\u2019s an important question \u2014 would I buy a Microsoft laptop instead? Lol, no.\n\nLook, I don\u2019t want to be a dick. The Surface Laptop 3 announced yesterday looks lovely. I mean, have a gander:\n\nI\u2019m getting a very strong \u201cI want to be a Macbook vibe\u201d here\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing about them that\u2019d drag me away from Apple laptops. There are no deal-breaking features, no design innovation, basically nothing that\u2019d drive me to give up macOS and head back to Windows.\n\nFor the moment, I\u2019m gonna hold on and hope Apple finally whole-asses its Macbooks.\n\nTablets and hybrid devices\n\nThis is when the Apple fan in me starts looking somewhat longingly over at Microsoft\u2018s gear. The company announced two devices in its hybrid range, the Surface Pro 7, and the Surface Pro X.\n\nThe new Surface Pro X looks pretty snazzy.\n\nWhile Microsoft\u2018s devices are slightly different to iPads (they\u2019re designed to be halfway between a laptop and a tablet, ergo the hybrid moniker), Apple is trying to move into this space with the iPad Pro.\n\nNow, design-wise, I\u2019m still on team Apple. But not by much. The Pro X in particular is a gorgeous bit of kit. But where I really start to admire Microsoft is in its adherence to making these hybrid devices fit for work.\n\nApple has been quietly positioning the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement, but I just don\u2019t see it. While the brand new iPadOS will make a big difference to people working on the tablet, it\u2019s far closer to a mobile operating system than a desktop one.\n\nThe Surface Pro devices on the other hand have more in common with a regular computer. For example, you can run desktop apps on it. And the keyboard has a track pad, which is a huge deal for anyone looking to, you know, actually do some work.\n\nFor me, the reason I work on a laptop is because of its versatility and power \u2014 something the Pro X has, which is a huge positive. So, if I had to get either a Surface Pro X or an iPad Pro, which would I choose? And, unfortunately for Microsoft, I\u2019d still go for the iPad Pro.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it was an easy decision. If I was required to work on the devices, I might edge towards the Surface Pro X, but using iPads feels like such a dream\u2026\n\nBut, there\u2019s a hell of a lot Apple could learn from Microsoft when it comes to making a tablet (or hybrid) device that people can actually work on. And I\u2019m a little jealous about that.\n\nHeadphones\n\nAhahahaha.\n\nAhahahahahahahahaha.\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA\n\nHonestly, what a riot.\n\nWhen we tried the Surface Earbuds, they were actually pretty comfortable. But come on. They might sound fantastic, have wonderful features, but those things are fucking butt ugly and I\u2019ll have nothing to do with them.\n\nIn my mind, this is such a typical old school Microsoft move: a product that probably works pretty well, but designed by someone who thinks hip-hop is an operation.\n\nI\u2019ll keep my AirPods thank you very much.\n\nThat New Shit\n\nBasically, I\u2019m not entirely sure what to call Microsoft\u2019s Surface Neo and Surface Duo. I guess they\u2019re dual-screen devices? But that sounds kinda clumsy. Foldables? But that brings to mind the unbroken (figuratively, not literally) screens of the Samsung Fold. No, in this instance we\u2019re going to refer to them as That New Shit.\n\nFor some background, the Neo is a tablet-style device:\n\nAnd the Duo is a phone:\n\nBut I can say with confidence that they\u2019re both 100 percent, totally That New Shit \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s so goddamn galling as an Apple fan. These things look cool. I honestly can\u2019t wait to test these devices out\n\nDo I expect the Duo and Neo to work well at first? Not really, they\u2019ll probably have a whole load of teething problems, but that\u2019s besides the point. They\u2019re exciting. This sort of fresh new take is something Apple doesn\u2019t dabble in. Yes, it\u2019s nice that we get polished products, but it also kinda sucks that we rarely see anything totally new from the company. And for an Apple fan, that can be disappointing.\n\nFair play, Microsoft.
