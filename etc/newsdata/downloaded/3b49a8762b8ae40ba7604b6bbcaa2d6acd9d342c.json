Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as a \u201ccougar\u201d on Thursday, and the Democratic presidential candidate responded hilariously \u2015and truthfully \u2015 without getting catty.\n\nThe two far-right conspiracy theorists who are already known for fraudulent claims \u2015 Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman \u2015 held a press conference in Arlington, Virginia, featuring Kelvin Whelly, a former U.S. Marine in his mid-20s who claims he had a paid sexual affair with Warren, 70, that included bondage.\n\nWhelly claims he met Warren through a male escort website, Cowboys4Angels, and that their first tryst occurred on Aug. 8, 2018, in Massachusetts. But he offered no verifiable evidence to back up his story and Rolling Stone later reported that the Cowboys4Angels chief executive said, after checking his records, that \u201cthis guy never worked for me.\u201d\n\nWohl and Burkman have made clear in the past their avid support for President Donald Trump, but even the pro-Trump Daily Caller noted that Whelly had a hard time keeping a straight face while discussing his allegations.\n\nWarren, meanwhile, won the day with a witty response that embraced her \u201ccougar\u201d past, telling the world it made her who she is.\n\nIt's always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston (go Cougars!).
