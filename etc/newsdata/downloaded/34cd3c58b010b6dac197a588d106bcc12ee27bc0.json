The recall came in response to an FDA test that found low levels of chrysotile asbestos contamination in samples from a bottle purchased online, according to the company.\n\nThe company advised people with a bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder from lot #22318RB to discontinue using the product and contact the company for a refund. It also noted the levels found were not greater than 0.00002% and said that it could not confirm whether cross-contamination had caused a false positive test result.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said Tuesday that 15 new tests of the same bottle of baby powder that had been tested by the FDA found no asbestos. An additional 48 new lab tests of samples from the recalled lot of Johnson's baby powder also did not contain asbestos, the company said. The tests were performed by two third-party labs as part of the company's testing and investigation.\n\n\"The Company has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe. Thousands of tests over the past 40 years, including FDA's own testing as recently as last month, repeatedly confirm that Johnson's Baby Powder does not contain asbestos,\" Johnson & Johnson's statement said.\n\nRead More", "description": "Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. said Tuesday it didn't find asbestos in the bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder that was previously tested by the US Food and Drug Administration and found to be contaminated.", "authors": ["Jamie Gumbrecht"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191018112024-johnson-and-johnson-baby-powder-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
