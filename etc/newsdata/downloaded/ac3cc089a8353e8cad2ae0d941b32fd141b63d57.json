Those found guilty face a prison sentence of as long as one year.\n\nCheng said he started campaigning for democracy when he was just 12 years old and stressed that any violence was directed at buildings and what protesters saw as symbols of mainland China rather than ordinary people.\n\nIt\u2019s the five demands or we keep on protesting Isaac Cheng, Demosisto\n\nHong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 under the Basic Law or mini-constitution that guaranteed people in the territory rights not seen on the mainland including an independent judiciary, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech for at least 50 years.\n\nWhile the chief executive is currently appointed by China, having been chosen by a committee made up of a select group of 1,200 people, and the Legislative Council is partially elected, the Basic Law does say that the \u201cultimate aim\" is for the city\u2019s leader and the legislature to be chosen by \u201cuniversal suffrage\u201d.\n\nEarlier, Cheng said that the current struggle and the greater willingness to adopt more violent methods were rooted in the failure of the Umbrella movement, where a 79-day occupation of the city centre failed to yield any concessions from the government.\n\nAnti-government protesters took to the streets peacefully on Sunday despite heavy rain.
