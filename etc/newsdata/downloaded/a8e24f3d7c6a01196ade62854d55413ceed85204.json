I think there is a gaping hole in the centre...'\n\n'I'm obviously not a partisan of Sadiq Khan's or indeed of any political party - I think that mayoral roles can be done very well by independents.\n\n'And I think the danger of mayors being part of political parties is they carry the whole damage and the baggage of those manifestos with them.'\n\nMr Stewart has been highly critical of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit, leading to him being sacked as a Tory MP by Mr Johnson last month - along with 20 other colleagues - for voting against a no-deal exit.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan is set to stand against Mr Stewart in the 2020 London Mayoral election\n\nOver the coming weeks, the Remain campaigner intends to emulate his walk across Afghanistan in 2002 - which the ex-diplomat wrote about for a travel book - by touring each borough of London on foot as part of a listening mission before the campaign kicks off.\n\n'I can make the role of mayor something bigger than it's been in the past - I think there's huge potential in the role of mayor of London,' Mr Stewart insisted.\n\n'I think it's something that we see in cities like New York, I don't think we've begun to see the potential of it.'\n\nWho is Justin Webb?

In 2001 Webb moved to the United States as the BBC's chief Washington correspondent and in 2009 returned to the UK to replace Edward Stourton on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nMr Stewart insisted that he sought to position himself as the London mayoral candidate without ties to either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson.\n\nHe added how mayors who were part of political parties carried 'baggage' of their manifestos and suggested he could 'really focus' on London's interests 'rather than being tied to Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson.'\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted yesterday: 'Rory Stewart wholeheartedly backed Tory cuts that have ripped the heart out of our communities and done so much damage to our police, NHS and schools. He would be a disaster for London.'\n\nResponding to the criticism on BBC Breakfast this morning Mr Stewart told presenter Charlie Stayt: 'You have just put your finger there on the classic thing, which is we are back to party politics again.\n\n'But I think what we shouldn't do is get into this world of everybody throwing personal insults.'\n\nRory Stewart appearing on BBC Breakfast this morning where he responded to Jeremy Corbyn's criticism of his candidacy to be Mayor of London\n\nThe interview comes following the awkward handshake of Mr Stewart and Mr Bailey yesterday in Victoria Tower Gardens in London.\n\nMr Bailey turned up just after Stewart revealed his resignation from the Conservative Party and said he was standing in next year's mayor election.\n\nIn the nail-biting clip posted by ITV's Paul Brand, Mr Bailey is seen striding across the grass and making a beeline for Stewart.\n\nLondon Mayoral candidates Rory Stewart and Shaun Bailey on Victoria Tower Gardens, London\n\nMoments later, Mr Bailey greets him with a shake of the hand without giving eye contact.\n\nThe Tory candidate can be heard saying 'good to see you' and repeats himself while they shake but refuses to hold Mr Stewart's gaze and continues walking with a smirk on his face.\n\nMr Stewart said London Mayor Sadiq Khan had 'made the most' of the role and that it was 'not clear' what his dreams are for the capital.\n\nBailey does not stop and chat during the encounter and continues to walk past the camera crew with a wide grin on his face before clapping his hands together and asking 'what's happening?'\n\nTwitter users noticed the awkward encounter of the two candidates and noticed Bailey could not look Stewart in the eye\n\nThe BBC have been contacted for comment.", "description": "BBC Today presenter Justin Webb (left) said that Rory Stewart (right) standing in the 2020 mayoral race was not 'really 2020' because he is a 'white guy and Old Etonian'.", "authors": ["Emily Webber For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/10/19329476-0-image-a-43_1570269539665.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
