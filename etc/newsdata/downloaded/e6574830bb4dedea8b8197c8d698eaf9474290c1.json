Inside the vast vaulted stone building, musicians dressed in ivory coloured cotton garments and rolled headscarves processed in a circle. Some chanted sacred hymns, while others played the drum and flute. Those gathered around them danced shoulder to shoulder.\n\nThese musicians are known as qewwals, singers of the ageless, orally transmitted sacred songs from the Yazidi religion.\n\nYazidis are a Kurdish-speaking religious minority, whose main population is concentrated in northern Iraq. In 2014, Isis militants killed, kidnapped and displaced thousands from their community. Today, this ancient minority is extremely fragile and scattered across the globe.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYazidis agree on the ancient roots of their religion, but not on the details of these origins. The religion is monotheistic, and their principal saint is the 12th-century Sufi mystic Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir, who was buried in a temple in Lalish, the religion\u2019s main pilgrimage site in northern Iraq. Academics also point to connections with ancient Iranian religions.\n\nThis arid and sparsely populated Armenian province might at first seem like an unusual place for such a temple and ceremony. Yet Yazidis are the biggest minority in Armenia, where over 80 per cent of the population is Christian and ethnic Armenian. In the last census in 2011, the Yazidi population in Armenia numbered at 35,000.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But they have come here to Armenia for the opening of Quba Mere Diwane, the biggest Yazidi temple in the world, and only the third modern temple outside of Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to sing sacred songs and play music to consecrate the temple. There are no sacred singers in Armenia, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d says Qewwal Ziad.\n\nEvent organisers estimated that over 20,000 people attended the opening day, from former Soviet Union countries as well as Europe. A delegation from Iraq included members of the Yazidi spiritual council and Yazidi military men. Representatives of the Armenian church, government officials, army veterans and the heads of Yazidi organisations in the US and Germany also attended.\n\nFor the visitors from the Yazidi diaspora communities of the former Soviet Union, this encounter with the Iraqi qewwals could be the first in generations. Throughout the morning, people approached them to take group pictures. As they processed inside the temple, crowds gathered to film the ceremony.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Reha, an elderly Armenian Yazidi from a nearby village, admired the embroidered white silk scarf worn by an Iraqi woman, \u201cI can\u2019t find scarves like this here. I\u2019d like one to wear at weddings,\u201d she sighs.\n\nBehind her, erect with eight spires and glistening white stone, was the massive new temple.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d asks Reha, \u201cHave you been inside?\u201d Like many elders from her secretive community, Reha is cautious when speaking to journalists. The view led to Mount Ararat, a mountain on the eastern border of Turkey, which many Armenians consider a symbol of their nation.\n\nYazidis have no holy book, and the religion\u2019s sacred texts were passed on orally by members of their religious castes, who keep the details of the religion a secret. In the past, this oral tradition was preserved by close-knit tribal communities. But today this religious knowledge has weakened as a result of ongoing migration, modernity, and conflict in Iraq, Syria and Turkey.\n\nIn Yazidi creation stories, the world was created by light. As such, followers pray facing the sun, believing sunlight to be an emanation of God. Their archangel, melak el tawus, takes the form of a peacock. They do not accept converts, and are required to marry within the religion in accordance to the strict caste system. Their population numbers today, estimated to be around 700,000 globally, are dangerously dwindling.\n\nUntil recently, Yazidis did not build temples outside of their heartland in Iraq. As well as the temple at Lalish, hundreds of smaller shrines also exist in Iraq close to Yazidi villages.\n\n\u201cFor a religion that does not have a book, these shrines helped preserve the religion, serving as points of confluence and pilgrimage for their communities,\u201d explains Tyler Fisher, of the University of Florida, who researches the reconstruction of Yazidi temples in Iraq.\n\nNow scattered, Yazidis of the former Soviet Union are the first among the community\u2019s ever-growing diaspora to build modern temples. A smaller temple with a single spire was first opened in Aknalich in 2012. This was followed by a temple and religious centre in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, which opened in 2015. These three temples were recognised by the Yazidi high spiritual council in Iraq, according to their organisers.\n\nYazidi living in Anatolian provinces of the Ottoman Empire \u2013 which today is eastern Turkey \u2013 began migrating to Armenia in the 19th century. And then in 1915, entire Yazidi villages fled genocidal campaigns against non-Muslim minorities of the collapsing Ottoman Empire, settling in Armenia.\n\nUp to 1.5 million Armenians are thought to have been killed in these campaigns. Under the Soviet Union, religion was banned, but Kurdish-speaking communities of Armenia and Georgia, who were predominantly Yazidi, received support to develop their culture, language and folklore.\n\nThe absence of buildings for worship was particularly felt in the Caucasus. Yazidi communities were cut off from their main pilgrimage site, Lalish, in northern Iraq for over 100 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Lalish, we know it from our songs and its stays in our hearts,\u201d says Anahit Sharuef, a Yazidi poet from a nearby village. Instead, Yazidi rituals in the Caucasus centred around the home and their cemeteries.\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, the church has played a powerful role in Armenia and Georgia, further weakening the religious minority\u2019s sense of identity. Many Yazidis often visit churches to light candles, and kept Christian iconography in their homes.\n\nIn the home of Armenian Yazidi villager Murad Usoyan, I spotted images of the Virgin Mary. \u201cShe\u2019s the Khatuna Fekhra, our Yazidi angel,\u201d he explains. \u201cOur religions have many parallels.\u201d\n\nFurther, economic hardship in post-Soviet Armenia is weakening the community\u2019s presence. Like many Armenians, Yazidis began migrating to Russia and Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 2011, the Yazidi population of Armenia had dropped by 30 per cent. Today, many isolated villages in which Yazidi traditions were preserved are mostly empty.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t build temples outside of Iraq, we will lose our religion and our culture,\u201d says Ruslan Jawoyan, an Armenian-born Yazidi living in Moscow, who was at the opening.\n\nOn the week of the opening, a small temple-like shrine was inaugurated in the isolated village of Sorik on the Armenian-Turkish border, and another religious building was nearing completion in the village of Riya Taza in the Aparan region of Armenia.\n\nIf we don\u2019t build temples outside of Iraq, we will lose our religion and our culture Ruslan Jawoyan, Armenian-born Yazidi living in Russia\n\nYazidi temples consist of one or two conical spires, or quba, each representing a Yazidi saint or angel. The spire has 12 or 24 ridges, and it ends in a circle symbolising the sun. The temple\u2019s base is rectangular or square, with either a flat or vaulted roof.\n\nHussein Hajji Othman, an Iraqi Yazidi writer who has come to Armenia for the opening, explains the spiritual significance of this architecture.\n\n\u201cThe temples are built from the ground to the sky. The bottom has four corners, representing chapters of peace. Above it, the spire simulates the sun beams. Everything above the spire is sunlight. Yazidis say that the sunlight is goodness, it is the source of life.\u201d\n\nWith its eight spires, the temple at Aknalich deviates from this traditional model. A central spire symbolises the Yazidi archangel Melak Tawus. It is surrounded by seven smaller spires, each dedicated to an angel. At the top of the entrance is the elaborate stone carving of a sun \u2013 a modern invention made specifically for this temple.\n\nThe temple\u2019s Yerevan-based architect, Artik Ghulyan, was influenced by ancient Armenian churches, whereby a central dome is surrounded by a series of smaller ones. Ghulyan introduced modern elements, such as a series of triangle-shaped motifs along the outer walls, which symbolise sun rays. \u201cIt recalls the ancient Mesopotamian cultures of Iraq,\u201d he says.\n\nThe spire of Yazidi temples is topped with a brass icon, which is traditionally shaped as a crescent moon or a hand. However, all eight spires at Aknalich are topped with a brass sun. \u201cThe crescent moon symbol feels increasingly alien to us, particularly since the attacks from Islamic State,\u201d says Dilman Jihad Qewwal Murad, another qewwal from Iraq. But other spiritual leaders are known to have opposed the sun-shaped icons at Aknalich, preferring the crescent moon or hand.\n\nInside are seven large sun-shaped chandeliers, and the icon of a peacock made of semi-precious stone. Colourful satin fabrics were laid out on an altar-like table facing the peacock. The visitors gathered around the table, kissing the fabric or tying knots to it. A visionary spiritual leader from Iraq known as a kochek blessed the visitors.\n\nYazidi temples are often connected to a burial ground. \u201cWhere a village does not have a temple, they will construct a small shrine by their cemeteries,\u201d says Fisher. Likewise, the first temple at Aknalich was built adjacent to a local Yazidi cemetery.\n\nThe grounds also serve as a memorial park for Armenian and Yazidi history. With its stone monuments dedicated to war heroes and intellectuals, it is reminiscent of Soviet-era memorial parks. It includes a sculpture and tombstone for the Yazidi war hero Janghir Agha, who led victorious battles against the Turks in Armenia in 1918. And a monument to the \u201cArmenian and Yazidi Friendship\u201d brings together the symbol of a Yazidi peacock with a Christian crucifix.\n\nA new monument commemorating the genocide of 2014 was unveiled on the opening day. It is the sculpture of Yazidi activist Nadia Murad, a former Isis captive and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. Visitors placed white flowers at the foot of the sculpture and prayed.\n\nAs such, many view the temple as a modern expression of Yazidism in the Caucasus. \u201cThere\u2019s been a renaissance of sorts. It\u2019s not just about religion, it\u2019s also about identity,\u201d says the Yerevan-based Yazidi academic Tereza Amryan.\n\nThe temple will stand for hundreds of years Hamlet Boghossian, stonemason involved in temple project\n\nThe new temple is also part of a wider trend in post-Soviet states, whereby successful businessmen from the diaspora build religious edifices in their home towns and villages. The economic and political vacuum following the collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as lawlessness and organised crime, spelt extreme poverty for most and riches for the very few. Over 200 new churches are said to have emerged in Armenia since the 1990s.\n\nThe temple\u2019s sponsor, the Moscow-based businessman Mirza Sloyan, who owns a shopping mall in Moscow, was born near Aknalich. \u201cThis enormous building is my latest project,\u201d he says, pointing back towards the temple that was still under construction, just days before the opening.\n\nIn response to the Isis attacks in 2014, he also founded the All Russian Yazidi Congress in Moscow, and the online video channel Lalish TV, which covers Yazidi news and culture globally.\n\nNo expense was spared. \u201cWe lost track of the budget long ago,\u201d says Hamlet Boghossian, who supervised the stone work. A stonemasonry workshop was installed next to the temple grounds, to carve durable marmarit stone that was imported from Iran. \u201cThe temple will stand for hundreds of years,\u201d says Boghossian.\n\n\u201cSo many of our temples were destroyed in Iraq by Isis militants in 2014. That\u2019s when I decided we should have a bigger temple here,\u201d says Sloyan.\n\nInside a newly built reception hall in the temple grounds, Sloyan talked about his childhood in the Soviet Union. \u201cArmenians didn\u2019t have to go to work. Instead, they said: \u2018Look at the face of a Yazidi person and you\u2019ll find success\u2019,\u201d he recalls, a popular trope about Yazidis bringing prosperity. He rested back against his armchair, occasionally swatting passing flies. To the table on his left, was a glistening taxidermy peacock with all its feathers.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I saw the religious institutions that the Armenians had, and I wondered why didn\u2019t we have such a place,\u201d he says.\n\nSloyan, who is now in his mid-70s, became interested in the Yazidi religion and culture in his later adult life. \u201cOur language is so complex. For example, we have a different word for how humans sit, how dogs sit, how lions sit \u2013 and many other animals\u201d he says. \u201cThe more I learn, the more it fascinates me.\u201d\n\nHis first journey to Iraq, he said, was for a pilgrimage in 1994. This was also a time when Kurds from former Soviet countries joined partisan groups operating from war-torn northern Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe flew from Moscow to Istanbul, then to Diyarbakir, and from there we drove across the border into Iraq,\u201d he recalls. \u201cOf course it was dangerous, but I went anyway. And I visited Iraq again during the recent war.\u201d His aides say that he was supporting refugees in the recent crisis.\n\nToday, Sloyan maintains relations with Iraq\u2019s Lalish Brigade, a Yazidi militia that is supported by the Iran-backed paramilitaries, known as the Hash\u2019d Al Shaabi. The brigade\u2019s leader, Ali Serhan Issa, was among the official guests from Iraq at the opening.\n\nBuilding the temple in Armenia was essential, Sloyan says.\n\n\u201cArmenia is the safest country in the world for the Yazidi people. I\u2019m happy I built it here, facing Mount Ararat. My grandchildren will also be proud.\u201d\n\nHowever some Yazidi religious figures opposed the new temple. Sheikh Hasan Tamoyan, an influential cleric and current president of the Yazidi National Union of Armenia argues that these new temples go against Yazidi religious teachings.\n\n\u201cOur religion does not accept worshipping stone and wood. We believe in the sun and its light,\u201d he said. Even the mausoleum at Lalish, he explains, is not a place for worship. \u201cIt\u2019s where Yazidis go to pay respect for their dead Saints.\u201d\n\nSheikh Hasan did not attend the opening, and I met him at his home in a suburb of Yerevan. Religious leaders interviewed for this article often had golden peacock figurines, paintings, and mini models of Lalish adorning their living rooms like icons. By contrast, Sheikh Hasan\u2019s home had no visible religious symbols.\n\n\u201cOur holy texts do not tell us to worship replicas of peacocks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of totemism. I hope our community will one day look beyond the superficialities of our modern times.\u201d\n\n\u201cYazidis have only two places for prayer. First in the morning they should stand in front of the sun, facing the east and far from strangers. Their prayers should be discrete and not demonstrative,\u201d he explains. \u201cThen we have special places to pray in our homes.\u201d He pointed to the ster, a colourful stack of folded mattresses which, among Yazidis of the Caucasus, is considered sacred. Sheikh Hasan, his wife and his children stood in front of the ster to pray, then kissed the fabric.\n\n\u201cThe building of new temples such as the one in Aknalich aspires to imitate Christianity.\u201d\n\nYet no religious opposition could curtail the excitement felt on the opening day at Aknalich.\n\n\u201cThis is an important and historic day for the Yazidi people,\u201d says Barfa Tamoyan, an Armenian-born Yazidi now living in France. Despite the heat of the opening day, she wears a voluminous black ball gown and velvet heels to mark the special occasion. \u201cWe have built a temple in a country that is not our homeland. I hope we\u2019ll have temples in Europe in the future.\u201d\n\nIn the gardens, well-known Yazidi bands from Russia and Germany played ceremonial songs, while crowds continued to pour in an out of the temple, filming the event on their phones, and taking selfies and group photos with friends and family.\n\nIn lyrics composed for the opening day, Aydin Amara sings, \u201cCome to the temple to a place of prayer and worship. To the Yazidi temple, from which heaven blows.\u201d", "description": "In the sleepy Armenian lakeside town of Aknalich, crowds gathered for the opening of a new temple.
