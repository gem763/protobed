Together they make up the only known intact library from antiquity, with the majority of the collection now preserved in a museum in Naples.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A fragment of a Herculaneum scroll carbonised during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Seales says it has also proved impossible to replicate findings that letters within Herculaneum scrolls can be deciphered by the naked eye from scans captured by a slightly different x-ray technique.\n\nAs a result the team have come up with a new approach that uses high-energy x-rays together with a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning.\n\nThe method uses photographs of scroll fragments with writing visible to the naked eye. These are used to teach machine learning algorithms where ink is expected to be in x-ray scans of the same fragments, collected using a number of techniques.\n\nThe idea is that the system will pick out and learn subtle differences between inked and blank areas in the x-ray scans, such as differences in the structure of papyrus fibres. Once trained on the fragments, it is hoped the system can be used with data from the intact scrolls to reveal the text within.\n\nSeales said the team have just finished collecting the x-ray data and are training their algorithms, adding that they will apply the system on the scrolls in the coming months.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The team taking on the task of reading the scrolls.

While classical libraries are believed to have had a Greek section and a Latin section, only a small proportion of scrolls from Herculaneum have so far been found to be in Latin, with the possibility there is a Latin section within the villa yet to be excavated.\n\nDr Dirk Obbink, a papyrologist and classicist at the University of Oxford who has been involved in training the team\u2019s algorithms, said the project was immensely exciting and agreed it is possible the text might turn out to be Latin. \u201cA new historical work by Seneca the Elder was discovered among the unidentified Herculaneum papyri only last year, thus showing what uncontemplated rarities remain to be discovered there,\u201d he said,\n\nBut Obbink is hoping the scrolls might even contain lost works, such as poems by Sappho or the treatise Mark Antony wrote on his own drunkenness. \u201cI would very much like to be able to read that one,\u201d he said.", "description": "US scientists say it may be possible to decipher words using new x-ray technique", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb835a1fd8da3e23bbcbd81ae49c644dd8455fa4/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6896db2e8212e1acf8b767d73c39f98b"}
