or a no-deal exit - is approved by MPs by 19 October.\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said although No 10 insisted it was not looking to break the new law, efforts were under way to examine ways of getting around it.\n\nMeanwhile, John Bercow has said he will stand down as Commons Speaker and MP at the next election, or on 31 October, whichever comes first, after 10 years in the role.\n\nThe prime minister has begun his second push for an early general election, opening a debate in Parliament by attacking Mr Corbyn's decision not to back a snap poll at this time.\n\nMr Johnson said Mr Corbyn had previously said he would back an election if legislation to prevent the government from forcing through a no-deal Brexit on 31 October became law.\n\n\"The surrender act has now passed, it's gained royal assent, he's done his level best to wreck this country's chances of a successful negotiation,\" the prime minister said.\n\n\"By his own logic, he must now back an election.\"\n\nMr Johnson said an election was the only way to break the deadlock in the Commons.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn told MPs that Labour was \"eager for an election - but as keen as we are we are not prepared to risk inflicted the disaster of no-deal on our communities out jobs our services or indeed our rights\".\n\nLabour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, the Independent Group for Change and Plaid Cymru met on Monday morning and agreed not to back the motion for an election.\n\nEarlier, the prime minister suffered another defeat in the House of Commons.\n\nMPs backed calls, by 311 votes to 302, for the publication of government communications relating to the suspension of Parliament and the release of all documents relating to Operation Yellowhammer, the government's no-deal contingency plan, shared with ministers since 23 July.\n\nFormer Conservative Dominic Grieve, the newly independent MP who tabled the motion, told MPs it was \"entirely reasonable\" to ask for the disclosure \"so the House can understand the risks involved and this can be communicated more widely to the public\".\n\nRule of law\n\nBut minister Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal preparations, said he had given evidence to the EU select committee on Yellowhammer and he hoped \"those assurances were sufficient\".\n\nImage copyright UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor Image caption Minister Michael Gove said he had given evidence to the EU select committee on Yellowhammer\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox, meanwhile, questioned the legal right of the government to require employees - including the PM's top aide Dominic Cummings - to open up their private email accounts and personal mobiles to scrutiny.\n\nAfter the vote, a government spokesman said the extent of disclosure demanded was \"unprecedented and disproportionate\", adding that it would \"consider the implications and respond in due course\".\n\nMPs also approved, without a formal vote, a motion from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn demanding the government abide by the rule of law.\n\nHe said the PM's unwillingness to state categorically that he would comply with the Brexit extension legislation was an \"assault on the rule of law\".\n\nImage copyright UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor Image caption MPs backed calls for the publication of government communications relating to the suspension of Parliament\n\nIn response Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would always uphold the law but the legislation in question was \"flawed\" and the UK would continue to negotiate on the basis of leaving on 31 October.\n\nThe prorogation - or suspension - of Parliament until 14 October will begin at the end of Monday's sitting.\n\nIt means MPs will not get another chance to vote for an early election until after then, meaning a poll would not be possible until late November at the earliest.\n\nElsewhere, one plan reportedly under discussion to get round the Brexit delay legislation is to ask a sympathetic EU member to veto an extension.\n\nAnother potential option would be to formally send the extension request mandated by the new law, but also send a second letter to the EU making it clear the UK government does not want one.\n\nHowever, Lord Sumption, a former UK Supreme Court judge, said such a ploy would not be legal.\n\n\"To send the letter and then try and neutralise it seems to me to be plainly a breach of the act,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nImage copyright UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor Image caption The Liberal Democrats are among the parties who have agreed not to back the election motion\n\nEarlier on Monday, Mr Johnson held talks with Leo Varadkar in Dublin - his first meeting with the Irish prime minister since he entered No 10.\n\nThe Irish border has proved a key sticking point in attempts to agree a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU.\n\nMr Johnson wants the controversial backstop - an insurance policy against a hard border on the island of Ireland - scrapped, because if applied, it would see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU and align with current and future EU competition rules.\n\nNorthern Ireland would also stay aligned to some rules of the EU single market.\n\nThese arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary.\n\nThe PM told a press conference he believed a deal could be done and an alternative to the backstop found.\n\nLeaving without a deal - something he said again he was willing to do - \"would be a failure of statecraft for which we will all be responsible\", Mr Johnson added.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Breaking down a big week for Brexit\n\nMr Varadkar said Ireland was \"open to alternatives\" to the backstop \"but they must be realistic\", adding: \"We haven't received such proposals to date.\"\n\nHe has said he is open to a solution involving a backstop which only applies to Northern Ireland, but Democratic Unionist Party MPs - Mr Johnson's allies in Parliament - strongly oppose the idea.", "description": "MPs are also set to reject a second call for a snap election, ruling out a poll before November.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mvnfx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
