The screed criticized Sutherland\u2019s dreadlocks as \u201cdisgusting and certainly not attractive\u201d and calling for a dress code for football players. That led to a program-wide outcry, with Sutherland later calling the message \u201crude, ignorant and judging.\u201d\n\nPenn State takes away shirts\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Holly Rowe, the shirts were reportedly worn without the blessing of head coach James Franklin, who had vigorously defended Sutherland as \u201cone of the most respected players in our program.\u201d\n\nThe shirts were reportedly collected from the players by Penn State personnel after the players took the field. Penn State later released a statement claiming it had the players remove the shirts out of fear of an NCAA violation.\n\nStory continues\n\nPSU statement on the pregame T-shirts\n\n\n\n\"While we are supportive of our students expressing themselves in a thoughtful manner, they are expected to wear team-issued apparel on game day. We asked our students to remove the shirts out of an abundance of caution for NCAA compliance.\" \u2014 Josh Moyer (@ByJoshMoyer) October 13, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the NCAA would have dared punish Penn State for such an expression, but then again, this is the entity that vacated a national championship because players borrowed their coach\u2019s Subaru.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Penn State football program has strongly rejected a letter sent to one of its players criticizing a player's dreadlocks as \"disgusting.\"", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/d2E.Fj17S1PuN_oieuwCUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T_KwwYo_IEOUbp47i5JjZw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/52f7d970-ed42-11e9-bef7-b58fbe02a4e2", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
