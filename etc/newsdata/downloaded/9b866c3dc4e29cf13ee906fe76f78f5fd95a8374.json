Numbers have been the way to go over the last decade with the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, although Microsoft has never spelled the number out.\n\nSo it's a bit of a mixed track record when guessing what the next Xbox will be. Sony has it easy: the PlayStation 5 makes a lot of sense.\n\nBut what about the next Xbox? I put the call out internally and externally to see what ideas people had. A fair few bet on the idea that Microsoft would wipe the slate clean altogether, simply naming the console Xbox. Others figured Big Green would keep things simple with Xbox 2, avoiding the mass market confusion that plagued the Wii U.\n\nBet'cha it'll be something dumb like, \"the Xbox\" \u2014 Stewb (@Pablo__durr) October 25, 2019\n\nNeXt Box \u2014 Adam Rorke (@Gharphield) October 25, 2019\n\nThe Xbox One X Box. \u2014 Stone Ocean When (@TheSaltminer) October 25, 2019\n\nXbox One More \u2014 Peter Burns (@Pierreth) October 25, 2019\n\nX Box One X 2 Or XBOX2 for short. \u2014 merkin rot (@Kermitron) October 25, 2019\n\nBeing Friday, a few took the opportunity to shitpost about the Dreamcast, adding more X's to the name, or just stealing Sony's thunder by adding a 5, which I'm all here for.\n\nTrue, but there's gotta be an X in there somewhere. The DreamXast? \u2014 Beavwa (@CannonFodderJnr) October 25, 2019\n\nV Box. So people don't think it's less than the ps5. \u2014 Syama Mishra (@SyamaMishra) October 25, 2019\n\nXbox 5 \u2014 mawt (@Mawtful) October 25, 2019\n\nXboxx Just keep adding an additional x until the end of time. \u2014 Jamie Dalzell (@Sir_JD) October 25, 2019\n\nI plan on calling it the Xbone 2 regardless of actual name, because I'm a very mature person. \u2014 Adam Wells (@TrjnRabbit) October 25, 2019\n\nOther suggestions from the Kotaku Australia offices were, shall we say, less than helpful:\n\nxBOx Straight Edge Hardcore Edition\n\nXbox System Update Required\n\nXbox Pro Max\n\nSE Xbox / Xbox SE\n\nX-BOX\n\nLil Box X\n\nXobx\n\nPersonally, I hope they bugger the numbers off altogether. Don't just call it an Xbox, because people already call the Xbox One an \"Xbox\". Gamers will know there's new hardware, and you'll see it on every billboard, cinema ad, bus and every website, but the families and households that make up a large chunk of the audience over the lifecycle of a generation could get confused.\n\nSo throw caution to the wind. Go with letters or numbers that aren't just a straight iteration. Xbox N or Xbox 2020. Even Xbox 20 could work. It's a bit Windows-esque, but at least it's aurally distinct from the Xbox/Xbox One era, which helps on a showroom floor.\n\nOr, hell, actually just keep the codename. Xbox Scarlett. It worked for Untitled Goose Game.\n\nWhat would you call the next Xbox?", "description": "We're about a year away from the next generation of consoles, and while Sony's plans for the PlayStation 5 are pretty straightforward, we don't know what the next Xbox is called.
