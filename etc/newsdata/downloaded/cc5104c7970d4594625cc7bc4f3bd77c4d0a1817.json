Instead of blocking the merger and maintaining all four major wireless carriers, the government is essentially trying to manufacture a fourth carrier to replace Sprint, by requiring T-Mobile to run a new Dish Network-branded wireless service for seven years while Dish builds its own network that will eventually compete with T-Mobile. If Dish doesn\u2019t build that network by 2023, it will have to pay a $2.2 billion fine.\n\nIf that sounds like a complicated scheme that doesn\u2019t quite make sense, you\u2019re not alone. In a new filing, a group of seven economists and antitrust experts say the court should reject the DOJ\u2019s proposed solution, calling it \u201cdoom[ed] ... to failure\u201d and \u201ca remedy that does not meet the standard of restoring the competition currently provided by Sprint.\u201d\n\nFor at least the next seven years, anyone buying service from Dish will just be getting rebranded T-Mobile service, and that\u2019s not actual competition. Beyond that, it\u2019s not a sure bet that Dish will ever actually build its own network, and even if it does, it\u2019s all but certain that network won\u2019t reach as many people as Sprint.\n\n\u201cfraught with risk that will surely doom it to failure\u201d\n\nThe filing is intended to convince the court to block the Department of Justice merger approval before it takes effect \u2014 technically, the DOJ filed a complaint in court to block the merger, and simultaneously filed the settlement containing the deal with T-Mobile and Dish. That settlement still has to be approved in federal court as serving the public interest. If the court isn\u2019t convinced that the deal restores competition, then it could be rejected, potentially leaving T-Mobile back at square one.\n\nHal Singer, an economist at Georgetown University and one of the authors of the paper, says he thinks there is a strong case for blocking the deal. \u201cWhat is so remarkable about this case is that DOJ\u2019s complaint doesn\u2019t pull any punches on the competitive harms\u201d of reducing the number of carriers from four to three, Singer says. \u201cThat puts a huge burden on the DOJ\u2019s settlement\u201d to prove the complicated requirements on T-Mobile and Dish will actually preserve competition.\n\nThe filing, which is remarkably readable for a legal argument from a bunch of academics, says that betting on Dish to compete is fundamentally wishful thinking. Dish \u201cwould be attempting what no company has ever done before \u2014 to build and operate a nationwide wireless network, at a cost of at least $10 billion, from scratch, and in a short number of years.\u201d\n\nAnd Singer just doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, because the business logic simply isn\u2019t there. \u201cAny rational firm in Dish\u2019s position would sooner milk the cushy access arrangement, pay the penalties for not building out, and then flip the spectrum back to an incumbent carrier before incurring the massive investment costs to build out,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDish will have to rely on T-Mobile\u2019s vague and non-credible promises to behave counter to its economic incentives.\u201d\n\nSince Dish has a history of breaking promises to build a network with the spectrum it already has, the chances of the DOJ\u2019s plan working are even lower, the authors say. \u201cThis significant undertaking exceeds what Dish has promised regulators before, but failed to deliver time and again,\u201d they write. \u201cThe DOJ\u2019s aspiration to create a new competitor in these circumstances is fraught with risk that will surely doom it to failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe DOJ has accepted a consent decree with Sprint / T-Mobile whereby Dish \u2014 a company with no history or presence in this industry \u2014 will for the foreseeable future try to compete as an MVNO reseller with no network, and in the less foreseeable future may acquire and develop assets sufficient to become a full-fledged wireless carrier,\u201d the authors write. \u201cFor that to happen, however, Dish will have to rely on T-Mobile\u2019s vague and non-credible promises to behave counter to its economic incentives.\u201d\n\nTo solve the problem of T-Mobile having to support its own new competitor, the deal contains a long list of things T-Mobile must do, including specific traffic management requirements, operational support, and three years of handling billing and customer support, but the authors say that list \u201cdiscloses by implication the enormous difficulties that arise in having one company assist its direct competitor.\u201d\n\nThe government traditionally prefers \u201cstructural\u201d solutions to merger problems, or simply selling off assets and businesses without further oversight, while the DOJ\u2019s plan is a \u201cbehavioral\u201d remedy that tries to tell Dish and T-Mobile how to do business under the eye of regulators. And that creates a lot of opportunity for funny business, say the authors. \u201cThe extreme dependency of Dish on the good graces of New T-Mobile creates abundant opportunities for \u2026 strategic pricing, slowdown of provision, alteration of terms or quality of the assets and services,\u201d the authors write.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that certain parts of the country will lose out.\u201d\n\nThe authors also point out that the deal doesn\u2019t actually require Dish to build a nationwide network \u2014 the coverage target in the deal is 70 percent of the population, not 70 percent of the country. \u201cIt is clear that certain parts of the country will lose out,\u201d write the authors. \u201c[Dish can] cover 50 percent of the population by just targeting 15 percent of the most urban areas in the U.S. Even if Dish hits that 70 percent goal, the resulting network likely will not fully replace Sprint\u2019s ubiquitous nationwide network, leaving nearly 100 million Americans with one fewer facilities-based carrier.\u201d\n\nThe filing, along with other comments on the proposed merger deal, will first be submitted to the DOJ, which will then post them publicly and submit them to the court. There\u2019s no timeline on when the court will make a decision yet, but the government will have to respond \u2014 and figure out how to prove that making T-Mobile help Dish Network build a network is somehow less complicated than letting anyone else buy Sprint.", "description": "The government\u2019s plan to let T-Mobile and Sprint merge while trying to turn Dish Network into a wireless competitor \"will surely doom it to failure,\" a group of antitrust experts say.", "authors": ["Nilay Patel", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-l8CTvW7N4bDE-6i9rPMseIzlus=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752769/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
