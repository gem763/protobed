His wonderful book, \u201cHow to Catch a Mole,\u201d is a beautiful, elegiac ode to a remarkable creature. It\u2019s also an exploration of Hamer\u2019s life as he approaches his sunset years. Each page is filled with wonder, love, regret, humility and a sense of wonder (and oneness) with nature.\n\n\u201cHaving worked all my life, created a family, discovered a home, I feel as secure as a working-class man ever feels,\u201d he writes. \u201cI feel a sense of equality again with the crow and the toad and the hawthorn, with the rain and wind. I am them and they are me. . . .. I am just another animal, another tree, another wild flower in the meadow among billions of others. . . . There is something deeply magnificent in being just ordinary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow to Catch a Mole,\u201d could be used as a guide to ridding a pest, but it\u2019s first a fine work of nature writing. Like all the classics of the genre \u2014 J.A. Baker\u2019s \u201cThe Peregrine,\u201d Eugene Marais\u2019 \u201cThe Soul of the White Ant\u201d and John Lewis-Stempel\u2019s \u201cMeadowland\u201d \u2014 it teaches us to look at the natural world anew, to develop eyes for the overlooked or the unseen. The book also delivers, via its furry central character, some useful life lessons.\n\nA mole can hear a human coming a half-mile away and when its tunnels are breached, it can sense the change in air pressure. Alert! Danger is afoot! \u201cIf a mole comes across something it doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Hamer writes, \u201che either digs it out and pushes it to the surface, or he blocks the tunnel and digs around the problem. Undefeated, he makes more molehills. He is a master of survival strategy, the first rule of which is \u2018Take a detour around the dangerous thing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nClever mole. In \u201cThe Wind in the Willows,\u201d he wears glasses for a reason. So a molecatcher needs patience, quietude and shrewdness. These are qualities Hamer has in abundance. At 16, Hamer left home, and over the course of the next 18 months, walked across Britain, honing the skills that make him a superlative mole catcher \u2014 invisibility and placidness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen laying a trap, he made the mole\u2019s home appear as undisturbed \u2014 and palatable \u2014 as possible. \u201cI try hard to give him the world he wants,\u201d Hamer explains, \u201cthe one he expects and feels comfortable in.\u201d\n\nThe great sadness of Hamer\u2019s career is that he loves the animals whose lives he ended. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy killing, so my methods had to be efficient, detached, fast and technical,\u201d he writes. You get a sense that a small part of him died every time he trapped a mole. But Hamer became a molecatcher to assure himself the work was done humanely.\n\n\u201cIn my early days as a gardener I was concerned that the few molecatchers I had come across showed little sensitivity, and that creatures were suffering. Looking back, of course, I have no idea what they felt. I judged them to be brutal men, but I am no different, not any more: the hammer shapes the hand, and I am moulded by the life I chose.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHamer is retired now. He refuses to kill moles anymore. He will, for a fee, advise people how to do it themselves, though he wishes they\u2019d leave them be, as they do in Germany and Austria, where the European mole is a protected species.\n\nRead Hamer\u2019s wondrous book, then explore your yard. You won\u2019t quite see it the same again.\n\nTimothy R.
