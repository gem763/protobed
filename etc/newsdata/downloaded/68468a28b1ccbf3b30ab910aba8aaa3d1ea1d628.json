The incident took place at the Dubrajpur Primary Health Center in Birbhum, West Bengal. According to what has surfaced, the mother fled after giving birth to the boy and dumping him in the wastebasket.\n\nWoman gives birth in hospital toilet\n\nA young woman in terrible labor pain entered the public sector hospital on Tuesday morning, alone. Since the staff on duty had no prior registry or information about the woman, they were slack and inattentive towards her. After being asked to wait, the woman soon darted for the toilet. Almost an hour later, employees of the hospital heard the crying of a baby from inside.\n\nUpon entering the toilet, there was no baby in sight, only the loud crying. After following the sound, a staff member rummaged through a filthy garbage can under the sink, where, to her utter shock, she found a newborn boy. The child was in perfect condition and miraculously survived under a load of trash that covered him. The mother was no where and had reportedly fled the scene.\n\nWhat\u2019s confusing the public\n\nSince the child was a healthy baby boy, the question of discarding on the basis of gender bias does not arise. This is leading netizens to question why the woman would abandon her newborn in such a manner. Secondly, according to a former nurse who practiced at a well-known hospital in Kolkata, the delivery seemed like one that was already prepped for.\n\nThe umbilical cord was perfectly cut--something that instigates suspicion on whether the hospital had anything to do with this, given that the lady was alone. Also, the fact that no one heard the woman scream or struggle in labour is rather abnormal, especially when the baby\u2019s crying was clearly audible.\n\nWhat happened next\n\nAfter the local police were alerted about the incident, they arrived at the scene to probe the matter. The child was then handed over to the newborn section at the Siuri Sadar Hospital, and the hunt for the mother is underway.\n\nFurious netizens have been actively seeking information on the newborn, many of whom have expressed the desire to adopt him. A user wrote: \u201cWhy does God give such cruel women these beautiful, innocent babies? If she didn't want the child she could have simply given him up for adoption. She did not have to throw him in the dirty dustbin and almost kill him. This is an attempt to murder. Whatevr may b the reason, this woman needs to be found, questioned extensively and punished for her action. Shame on u!!!\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Yesterday, a healthy newborn baby boy was found in the toilet dustbin at Dubrajpur Primary Health Center in Birbhum, West Bengal.
