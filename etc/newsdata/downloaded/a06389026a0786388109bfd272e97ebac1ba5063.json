The refrain \u201cwill of the people\u201d turns out to be \u201cwill of the men\u201d.\n\nBritain has endured nine years of austerity since 2010 and women have been hit hardest, with only 20 per cent of the public spending cuts falling on men. Brexit will only make the situation worse. Whether we end up with Boris Johnson\u2019s deal or a catastrophic no deal scenario, the UK will end up with a smaller, weaker economy. This, in turn, will provide yet the latest excuse for spending cuts.\n\nA no-deal Brexit would undoubtedly be the worst outcome for Britain, leaving us with a weaker pound and higher prices for those products we can still access. The fact that ministers are seriously contemplating food shortages as an acceptable price to pay shows just how unhinged the pursuit of \u201cBrexit at any price\u201d has become.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It will mean many more job losses in the public sector, in which women are more likely to work. Far from being a \u201cclean break\u201d, it will mean years of uncertainty for households across the country.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Three in four trafficking victims, for example, are women. EU law in the form of the trafficking directive provides crucial protections that can save lives. These common endeavours were always hated by Eurosceptic men, and they almost succeeded in stopping the UK from opting into the law in the first place. Only when 46,000 people signed a petition did David Cameron give in. The UK is yet to offer any alternative to the EU duty to provide victims of modern slavery with support, instead suggesting we\u2019ll use our new found \u201csovereignty\u201d to do less for some of the most vulnerable women on the planet.\n\nIt is a similar story for domestic abuse laws. Common EU legislation means that restraining orders issued in one country apply in all the others, and it\u2019s possible to gain enhanced protection if you move to another member state by securing a European Protection Order. Brexit means diminished rights for all British citizens to live, work and study across the EU, but the reduced protections available to those fleeing from abusive relationships should be of considerable concern to all.\n\nAs these most basic rights, freedoms and protections are stripped away, women cannot rely on British governments for continued entitlement to equal pay either. The next target for the Tory right will be the Equality Act \u2013 \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d \u2013 and with it rights to equal pay and equal treatment. These guarantees are presently underpinned by EU law which, having been supported by the 28 democratically elected governments and the democratically elected EU parliament, has \u201cdirect effect\u201d in the British courts. Likewise, EU law safeguards maternity leave and the right to keep your job afterwards, and it protects shared parental leave, which has begun to level the playing field in the workplace.\n\nBrexit will have a disproportionate impact on women, many of whom did not vote for it to happen. As hundreds of thousands march from Park Lane to Parliament Square this weekend, it\u2019s vital our voices are heard. Labour has a proud tradition of protecting women\u2019s rights. Only by adopting a clear Remain stance ahead of the public being given the final say on Brexit can we do justice to that legacy.\n\nTulip Siddiq is Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn and a supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain group", "description": "One of the many lies to have gained credibility through repetition is that Britain \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d voted for Brexit in 2016.
