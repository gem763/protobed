Users have spotted a bug causing Cortana to take up a good chunk of your CPU and it's chewing up battery life and choking performance. Here's what you can do to fix it.\n\nWindows has released a new update, KB4512941 (OS Build 18362.329), in order to fix some errors with starting Windows Sandbox as well as a variety of other bugs.\n\nWhat the update also does is increase Cortana's CPU usage to around 40 per cent, as reported by Windows Latest.\n\nSome Reddit users have alleged Cortana's suddenly taking up to 90 per cent of their device's CPU while others reported more modest, but still critical, numbers of around 40 per cent.\n\nKB4512941's landing page states it's \"not currently aware of any issues with this update\" so an official fix doesn't seem immediately likely.\n\nOther users, thankfully, have offered a workaround to stop Cortana from chewing up your PC power.\n\nThe first option is pretty simple; just uninstall it. To do so, open up Settings (WIN + I), select Update & Security, hit View update history, hit Uninstall updates and select KB4512941 to rid of it.\n\nImage: Microsoft\n\nIf, however, you want the other bug fixes included in the update, you can attempt a riskier involving editing the Windows Registry.\n\nYou'll need to find the registry name first at [Computer]\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Search, then find BingSearchEnabled. The value is set to 0 and some have reported changing it to '1', or removing the registry key altogether and then restarting, solves the problem. It's best to backup first before taking this step, if you opt for it.\n\nWith Microsoft yet to acknowledge the update's bug, you've only really got these options to work with for now.", "description": "Another day, another Windows 10 bug stifling your life.
