Lockheed is separately developing the moon-bound astronaut capsule named Orion. Northrop helped NASA build the Apollo lunar landers in the 1960s. Draper, a not-for-profit research and development organization, built NASA's navigation computers for Apollo lunar landers.", "description": "Bezos's Blue Origin partners with Lockheed, others on moon lander", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L1CC-OCATC_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
