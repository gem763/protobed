\u00a330 a week so she can spend \u00a37,500 on toddler\u2019s pageants", "language": "en", "text": "Portia Richmond, 27, has spent \u00a37,500 so far on daughter Amelia\u2019s pageants (Picture: Caters News)\n\nA mum lives on just \u00a330 a week in order to spend \u00a37,500 on her toddler\u2019s pageants.\n\nPortia Richmond, 27, from Derby, bulk buys cheap food and only purchases second-hand furniture in order to splurge thousands on spray tans, outfits and wigs for her daughter Amelia, three.\n\nThe stay-at-home mum admits that she often gets trolled by people who don\u2019t agree with her decision to put her young child in the spotlight.\n\nBut she insists that her daughter is \u2018always itching to be on the stage\u2019 and wants Amelia to continue taking part in pageants in adulthood.\n\nAt an average pageant, Portia can spend up to \u00a31,000 on a beauty dress, as well as up to \u00a3325 on other outfits, \u00a3100-\u00a3150 on an entry fee and \u00a360 on make-up and spray tan.\n\nDiscussing how she balances the high costs of the contests with every day life, she says she heads to Aldi to buy the budget supermarket\u2019s own brand 30p canned goods and \u00a32 18 pack of crisps, as well as Aldi bread at 49p and butcher deals for \u00a320.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018One pageant can cost more than \u00a31,500 so I have to cut back on other costs.\n\nAmelia\u2019s mum says she \u2018loves\u2019 taking part in pageants (Picture: Caters News)\n\n\u2018For the pageants, I\u2019ve got to be looking at a minimum of \u00a3500 for one outfit and for make-up, spray-tan and hair, they\u2019re around \u00a3100.\n\n\u2018Shoes cost about \u00a330, photos are another \u00a325 and with travel on top is another \u00a320.\n\n\u2018So we\u2019ll save where we can, so we can be sure Amelia can compete.\n\n\u2018I know I\u2019m quite tight when it comes to spending on other things such as food shopping but it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\u2018For the four of us, I\u2019ll cook a spaghetti bolognese, feed us all and I freeze another four meals out of it, same with curry dishes, casserole and soup\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll bulk buy my meat and freeze it so I just have to top up on veg each week.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t buy branded items, and if I need new furniture for the house then I\u2019ll buy them second hand, never brand new.\u2019\n\nPortia \u2013 who competed in pageants herself until last year \u2013 has estimated that she has spent around $5,000 on her toddler\u2019s journey so far.\n\nPortia in her pageant dress (Picture: Caters News)\n\nSpeaking about the effort she puts into her daughter\u2019s appearances, she says she spends 45 minutes doing her hair and half an hour doing her foundation, eye shadow, bronze, eye lashes and glitter, before getting her into a dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says some people \u2013 including Amelia\u2019s dad \u2013 don\u2019t agree with the pageants, but her daughter \u2018loves\u2019 them.\n\nPortia said: \u2018Amelia\u2019s dad, Jayce doesn\u2019t really agree with pageants, thinking if I\u2019m going to get her into anything it should be something professional like dance not pageants.\n\n\u2018But he\u2019s not seen her in one, so doesn\u2019t really understand it \u2013 Amelia is happy doing them, which is all that matters as you can seen how much she loves it.\n\n\u2018Yet my son, Coleson-Christopher, two loves to help her practice for them at home.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s worth it absolutely \u2013 we don\u2019t go without and we still have lovely home cooked healthy meals just like everyone else.\n\n\u2018I just do it on a budget and love to see Amelia enjoying it \u2013 the community is like a family.\u2019\n\nAmelia at home in Derby preparing for her next competition (Picture: Caters News)\n\nShe added: \u2018I wanted to get her into modelling initially but the work is more spasmodic and not as guaranteed.\n\n\u2018Some people don\u2019t agree with the make-up but Amelia loves it.\n\n\u2018They can call me a pushy mum, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s just like a dance competition with a crown at the end instead of a trophy.\n\n\u2018People have this preconceived notion that I\u2019m pushing her into it, but that\u2019s not the case at all.\n\nPrince Harry and Kate Middleton whizz to Pakistan reception in colourful tuk tuk\n\n\u2018Amelia will come downstairs, twirling her baton or whatever prop she\u2019s going to use and want to practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018People think it\u2019s a bitchy environment, with mums competing but that\u2019s not an accurate perception.\n\n\u2018Amelia loves doing it and loves the different themes \u2013 she\u2019s always itching to be on the stage, and I\u2019ve already got family members helping me to make dresses and routines for the next show.\n\n\u2018I hope she continues doing them into the 18+ Miss categories, and I\u2019ll invest as much as I need to into them \u2013 I\u2019ll even choreograph all her routines!\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
