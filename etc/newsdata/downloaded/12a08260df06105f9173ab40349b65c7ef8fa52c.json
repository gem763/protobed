Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. And both are running on the same issues: \u201csocialism\u201d and the aborted plan to bring Amazon\u2019s East Coast headquarters to the district, which Ocasio-Cortez opposed and helped kill.\n\nRepublican Scherie Murray, 38, objects to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of progressive presidential contender Bernie Sanders, which the congresswoman delivered at a rally in late October \u201cwith the backdrop of the Queensbridge Park Houses,\u201d Murray noted. The residents of that public housing development would have been candidates for some of the 25,000 jobs that Amazon said it would bring to the area.\n\n\u201cIt was a slap in the face to hard-working people,\u201d said Murray in an interview with Yahoo News. \u201cAnd to force a narrative of a socialist agenda. What we saw was AOC deliver socialism to America. And we ought to be afraid of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe literally ran Amazon out of New York City,\u201d said Fernando Cabrera, 55, a Democratic member of the City Council whose Bronx district, across the East River from Queens, overlaps with part of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 14th District. \u201cMost cities were craving, yearning, negotiating to have them in their city. And here we had a freshman congresswoman literally [run] out 25,000 jobs,\u201d he told Yahoo News.\n\nCabrera, a church pastor who describes himself as \u201cpro-capitalist\u201d and has served as a City Council member for 10 years, said that was the key moment that inspired him to run against the rookie congresswoman.\n\nCabrera is one of two Democrats hoping to challenge Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary, scheduled for June 23, 2020. Murray has seven rivals so far for the Republican nomination. The district is overwhelmingly Democratic.\n\nOcasio-Cortez told Yahoo News in April that she didn\u2019t regret opposing the Amazon deal.\n\nBut her opposition to the project, based largely on the enormous tax breaks the company had negotiated from the city and state, has underscored what Murray and Cabrera see as the bigger problem \u2014 socialism.\n\nScherie Murray. (Photo: Yahoo News Video) More\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a shift in politics as we know it now,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd we see the movement of this far-left socialist narrative that\u2019s seeping into the political arena.\u201d\n\nShe called policies introduced or supported by Ocasio-Cortez, such as the Green New Deal, Medicare for All and free college, \u201cdetrimental to America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very concerned about the trajectory that this country is going in, and it\u2019s not the future I want for my kids and grandchildren,\u201d said Cabrera, calling capitalism \u201cpart of the heart\u201d of why he\u2019s running. He described socialism as \u201ca pipeline of dreams that is not even a dream. It\u2019s a nightmare, because the reality is you can\u2019t pay for that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI know what it is to come from nothing. I know what it is to sleep on the floor on a mattress. I didn\u2019t come from big wealth. I came from a broken home ... and it was free enterprise that gave me an opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe councilman formerly served as a program director for the mental health and counseling program at Mercy College in New York and is currently the senior pastor at New Life Church International, a nondenominational church in the Bronx.\n\nFollowing Cabrera\u2019s announcement, in which he called out Ocasio-Cortez and charged her with failing her district, the congresswoman\u2019s campaign \u2014 in a fundraising email that did not mention Cabrera directly \u2014 said, \u201cCorporate Democrats have been waiting for their chance to strike back\u201d after her victory last year.\n\n\u201cOur opponent doesn\u2019t play by the same rulebook we do,\u201d the email went on to say. \u201cHe\u2019ll be more than willing to raise huge dollars from wealthy donors, take special interest PAC money, and pander to corporate giants like Amazon.\u201d", "description": "A Jamaican immigrant businesswoman from Queens and a Latino councilman from the Bronx are among 10 candidates who have filed to unseat freshman Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5gI3_WGs.pUzmKq0WbRPxg--~B/aD03OTg7dz0xNDE2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/527d1fb0-fb2e-11e9-8dc2-07991b03726e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
