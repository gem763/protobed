Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected an average annual rate of 5.40 million.\n\nWhat happened: The median sales price increased 5.9% from the prior year to $272,100, as prices increased across all four regions nationwide. Unsold inventory was at a 4.1-month supply, up slightly from August but down from the 4.4-month figure from September 2018.\n\nSales volume dropped across the entire country last month, the National Association of Realtors reported. Sales fell the most in the Midwest, dropping 3.1%, followed by the Northeast (down 2.8%) and the South (down 2.1%). Existing-home sales only declined 0.9% in the West.\n\nBig picture: The decline in mortgage rates in recent months and continued strength of the job market renewed interest in home-buying for many people who were kept on the sidelines because of affordability constraints. As a result, sales activity remained elevated the past two months, exceeding economists\u2019 expectations.\n\nWould-be buyers looking to take advantage of the low-rate environment have a major obstacle in their path: The low supply of homes for sale. That depleted inventory of homes has pushed prices up, and the uptick in foot traffic as a result of low interest rates increased competition for the small supply of homes. That in turn has pushed home prices even higher, likely sidelining some prospective buyers once again.\n\nUltimately, new-home construction will need to pick up \u2014 in addition to interest rates staying low \u2014 for Americans to buy homes at a fast and steady clip for a lengthier period of time.\n\n\u201cHome prices are rising too rapidly because of the housing shortage, and this lack of inventory is preventing home sales growth potential,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cEven with the modest disappointment in September resales, overall home sales (new and existing combined) almost certainly exceeded a 6 million pace for the quarter, the best performance in six quarters,\u201d Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, wrote in a research note.\n\nMarket reaction: The 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.36% fell 2% in morning trades Tuesday, as markets look to the U.K. to see whether lawmakers will approve the Brexit deal put forth by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.18% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.16% were trending slightly higher Wednesday morning.", "description": "Home prices increased nationwide as home buyers found fewer options of houses for sale.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT778_buyers_ZG_20191022104121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
