People from the country's different religions are revolting against the sectarian government and fear.\n\n'This is not the result of one week or one year or ten years but 30 years of dissatisfaction with the government.\n\n'The sectarian division has to stop.'\n\nLebanese protesters wave flags and shout anti-government slogans in front of the Al-Ameen mosque in downtown Beirut on Thursday evening\n\nA Lebanese national flag is placed on barbed wire next to the Government Palace on Thursday\n\nHezbollah supporters scuffle with anti-government protesters during eighth day of protest in Riad Al Solh Square in downtown Beirut on Thursday\n\nProtesters wear ponchos and drape themselves in Lebanese national flag in the rain\n\nWahib said that economic factors played a huge part in the unrest. 'I am speaking as someone from Lebanon's middle class and even I struggle to make a living.\n\n'I work in the banking industry but had to take a second job as a football coach just to make ends meet. Everyone is struggling to survive.'\n\nEarlier this week Hariri's embattled government approved an economic rescue plan in an effort to quell raging demonstrations. The new measures include a deal on the 2020 budget and the scrapping of new tax hikes - significant reforms that seemed unlikely just the week before.\n\nBut the last-ditch move was met with deep distrust from a swelling protest movement seeking the removal of the entire political class. Wahib told MailOnline: 'The new reforms were just a way for Hariri to try and cover himself.'\n\nWahib described the mood at the protests in Lebanon's capital as 'hopeful.'\n\n'The mood is amazing,' he said. 'We are living on the streets and there are places playing music, food kiosks, and people dancing and singing.\n\n'There is a patriotic, hopeful mood and everyone seems happy.\n\n'People from every social class and age are turning out - from kids to elderly people.'\n\nChild wearing a poncho stands next to a Lebanese national flag during demonstration on eighth day of protest\n\nAn-anti government protester listens to Lebanon's President address the nation during a protest in Jal el-Dib\n\nAnti-government protesters react as they listen to Lebanon's Michel Aoun on speaker in the town of Jal -elDib in northern Beirut on Thursday\n\nHe added that he sees the protests as an an 'awakeneing of the Lebanese people' who have had 'trust issues' with the country's leaders since the devastating civil war.\n\nProtesters are demanding the 'downfall of the regime', the slogan of the 'Arab Spring' that toppled four leaders in 2011.\n\nWhile many want the entire toppling of the ruling class, Wahib said he sees that as a perhaps unachievable 'utopia'.\n\nHe believes that before the resignation of ministers there needs to be an election 'to replace parliament and eventually replace the president.'\n\nThe country's president, Michel Aoun, on Thursday offered to meet the protesters whose week-old mobilisation has brought the country to a standstill.\n\nHezbollah supporters wave Lebanese national flags as riot police separate them from protesters in Beirut on Thursday\n\nAnti-government protesters light flares and wave Lebanese flags on Thursday\n\nProtesters wearing ponchos pose for a selfie in the rain during demonstration on Wednesday\n\n'I am ready to meet your representatives... to hear your demands,' Aoun said.\n\nProtests sparked on October 17 by a proposed tax on calls made through messaging apps like Whatsapp have morphed into unprecedented cross-sectarian street demonstrations.\n\nDemonstrators are demanding corruption be weeded out, as well as the overthrow of the entire political class.\n\nIn downtown Beirut, tens of thousands have gathered daily and the unrest has also spread to the southern city's of Tyre and Nabatiyah in the country's largest demonstrations in five years.\n\nOn Friday anti-corruption protesters cut off major roads in Lebanon for a ninth day, pledging to keep paralysing the country despite an offer by the president to meet their representatives.\n\nMeanwhile Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah today warned that nationwide protests could push the country into chaos, collapse and 'god forbid' civil war, rejecting mounting calls to bring down the government and president.\n\n'We do not accept the fall of the presidency nor do we accept the government's resignation and we do not accept, amid these conditions, holding early parliamentary elections,' said Nasrallah.\n\nPraising the protest movement for achieving 'unprecedented' economic reforms announced this week he said Lebanon must now search for any solution to move forward and prevent a dangerous power vacuum.\n\nComplicating any negotiations, the protesters have no clear leadership and Lebanon's sectarian politics has numerous centres of power. Moreover, old rivalries among leaders are resurfacing.\n\nLebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri. The main parties could agree a reshuffle that leaves Sunni Muslim Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in office but replaces prominent ministers with technocrats seen as better qualified to enact badly needed reforms\n\nThe main parties could agree a reshuffle that leaves Sunni Muslim Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in office but replaces prominent ministers with technocrats seen as better qualified to enact badly needed reforms.\n\nSuch a solution, which has been under discussion, would need the support of all the main parties. The administration must also conform with sectarian power-sharing quotas among Christian and Muslim sects.\n\nThis may not satisfy protesters, who know that decisions would remain in the hands of the dominant parties.\n\nHariri's option to quit is off the table for now since he and several major parties feel it would plunge Lebanon deeper into crisis at a dangerous time and his coalition partners have approved reforms he announced on Monday.\n\n'The real problem is that you cannot bring any prime minister other than Saad because there is no (other) Sunni to parachute now and he is the only one who has international support,' said a former minister.\n\nThe prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim according to Lebanon's sectarian system.\n\nSome politicians may be hoping that protester fatigue will set in and ease pressure, allowing the government to continue unchanged so it can implement reforms.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Lebanese bank worker Wahib has revealed the anger citizens hold against their government as he describes ongoing protests against the political class as a 'revolution'.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20185860-0-image-a-75_1572016434630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
