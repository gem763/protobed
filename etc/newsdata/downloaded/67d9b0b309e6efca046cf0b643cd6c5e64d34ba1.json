Upon examining the very similar features of the twin bubbles, researchers believe they've found evidence that they were formed from a violent eruption that quickly punched through the interstellar medium in opposite directions.\n\n\"The shape and symmetry of what we have observed strongly suggests that a staggeringly powerful event happened a few million years ago very near our galaxy's central black hole,\" William Cotton, an astronomer with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, and co-author on the paper, said in a press statement.\n\nWATER DETECTED ON POTENTIALLY HABITABLE EXOPLANET FOR THE FIRST TIME, SCIENTISTS SAY\n\n\"This eruption was possibly triggered by vast amounts of interstellar gas falling in on the black hole, or a massive burst of star formation which sent shockwaves careening through the galactic center. In effect, this inflated bubbles in the hot, ionized gas near the galactic center, energizing it and generating radio waves that we could eventually detect here on Earth,\" Cotton said.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A pair of radio-emitting bubbles that tower hundreds of light years above and below our galaxy were discovered by an international team of astronomers.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/radio-image-milky-way-galaxy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
