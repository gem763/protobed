I\u2019ve got surrogate children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nAnd those colleagues turned out in force to help Sue celebrate her milestone when show producer Iain MacLeod helped present her with a cake on set \u2013 an icing Audrey perched on a replica of her hair salon.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nBut it is the unscripted side of life that presents the veteran actress with her biggest struggles.\n\nAlthough you would not guess from her lively screen performance, Sue has just recovered from a broken collar bone after a fall in her Manchester flat.\n\nShe explains: \u201cI live in a tiny flat and Mark goes to bed much earlier than me.\n\n\u201cI was creeping around in the dark after taking my face off at about 11 o\u2019clock and sat on the side of the bed.\n\n\u201cBut I missed the bed and fell over. I had to have an operation, be written out of some scenes and take time off \u2013 which I hate doing as I don\u2019t like letting people down. But everyone was so lovely.\n\n\u201cThis all happened after I got my Outstanding Achievement Award \u2013 serves me right for being big-headed!\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIt is that self-deprecating sense of humour that has made Sue such a hit with viewers throughout her 40 years on the cobbles.\n\nThe award she refers to is a special gong she was presented with at this year\u2019s British Soap Awards. And this month she features in a one-off ITV show, Coronation Street Icons: Audrey Roberts \u2013 40 Fabulous Years.\n\nLooking back at Audrey\u2019s highs and lows, the documentary includes celebratory celebrity contributions from current and former cast members.\n\nThey include Helen Worth (Gail Platt), Amanda Barrie (Alma Baldwin), Brian Capron (Richard Hillman) and Nigel Havers (Lewis Archer).\n\nBut Sue is adamant the tribute from her employers and colleagues should not be seen as the showbusiness equivalent of a carriage clock, handed over as a \u201cthank you and goodbye\u201d after long service. For \u2013 barring any more unforeseen accidents \u2013 if Sue has her way, she has plenty more years on the cobbles to come.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nShe admits: \u201cFriends say to me, \u2018Oh, are you going to do another year?\u2019 And I think, \u2018Well, if they ask me, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well you\u2019re 70 plus now\u2026\u2019 But I love this job \u2013 in fact I\u2019ve loved it more these last few years than I\u2019ve ever done.\n\n\u201cI have fun here, I\u2019d never want to just sit at home. If they ever got rid of me I might try doing other things \u2013 I\u2019d love to go back to singing and get my voice trained again \u2013 just to do something. I wouldn\u2019t retire.\u201d\n\nSue joined the show in 1979 as Gail Platt\u2019s flirtatious mother. Her first scene was with the legendary Pat Phoenix \u2013 one of the soap\u2019s first stars, who played Elsie Tanner.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAnd she worked with other iconic names, including Violet Carson (Ena Sharples), Doris Speed (Annie Walker) and Margot Bryant (Minnie Caldwell).\n\nMany hail those days as Coronation Street\u2019s golden era, and Sue acknowledges the show has changed a great deal since then. She says: \u201cI think the\n\nhumour in the classic old Corrie episodes is brilliant.\n\n\u201cOne can learn from the old ones, they were real and very funny.\n\n\u201cBetty Driver, Bill Waddington \u2013 who played Percy Sugden \u2013 you felt you knew them as characters.\n\n\u201cSometimes I wonder if I\u2019m not doing too much \u2013 I like reality, rather than slapstick humour.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nElegant, warm and with a talent for seeing the funny side of life, Sue in the flesh is not at all the waspish Audrey she presents on-screen, plagued by her dysfunctional and ever-growing family \u2013 daughter Gail, grandchildren David, Nick and Sarah and great-grandchildren Bethany, Max, Lily and Harry.\n\nShe grew up in Walsall, West Midlands, with elder sister Judith and parents Harmer and Dorothy.\n\nHer dad was distinguished Midlands businessman Sir Harmar Nicholls \u2013 later, Lord Harmar-Nicholls \u2013 Conservative MP for Peterborough from 1950 until 1974 and then a Manchester MEP.\n\nHe was made a life peer in 1975 \u2013 meaning Sue is entitled to be addressed as The Honourable Susan Nicholls.\n\nShe credits her success to all the support she had from her parents and sister.\n\nSue studied at RADA, joining Crossroads in 1964 as waitress Marilyn Gates. She spent four years there, even releasing a Top 20 single, Where Will You Be?\n\nBefore moving to Corrie she played opposite Leonard Rossiter as Joan Greengross, the secretary in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. And she is also still often recognised as Nadia Popov, from children\u2019s TV show Rentaghost.\n\nBut it is her 40 years as Audrey Roberts that have established her as one of the country\u2019s favourite television actresses. She smiles: \u201cIf they\u2019ll have me, I\u2019d love to be here in 10 years\u2019 time because I like playing her. There\u2019s lots to achieve yet, so if I get the sack I\u2019ll lock myself in Audrey\u2019s salon and refuse to leave.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The actress has played hairdresser Audrey Roberts since 1979 \u2013 and says her much-loved co-stars are \u201cmy surrogate children and grandchildren\"", "authors": ["Sue Crawford", "Image", "David Fisher Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Instagram", "Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653315.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-British-Soap-Awards-Show-The-Lowry-Manchester-UK-01-Jun-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
