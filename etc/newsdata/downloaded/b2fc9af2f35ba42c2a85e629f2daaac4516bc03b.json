In case you don\u2019t believe me, listen to the crowd at Dodger Stadium Thursday night as they make their case for their star with chants of \u201cMVP, MVP.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Bellinger said, speaking to reporters during Wednesday\u2019s pre-series workout. \u201cI tried to block it out as much as I could throughout the year. The last series in San Francisco actually I kind of soaked it in. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m just going to do what I can to end this year strong and keep my name in the conversation. And now it\u2019s out of my hands, so I\u2019m not going to worry about that right now and put all my focus in on these next games that we got to play.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar ritual to Nationals fans, who took up the same chant often when Anthony Rendon \u2014 with 117 runs scored, 44 doubles, 34 home runs, 126 RBI and a .319 average, an MVP candidate as well \u2014 stepped up to the plate, as they did Tuesday night at the wild card game, chanting, \u201cMVP, MVP.\u201d\n\nLike Rendon is, his answer was a little more complicated. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re yelling at or yelling for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a little crazy. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m definitely not a fan of the attention. But it\u2019s good to get recognized for, I guess, the hard work that you put in over the years. So it\u2019s definitely humbling and appreciative.\u201d\n\nThe MVP debate that will be part of the narrative this series illustrates a bigger story of the Nationals-Dodgers NLDS \u2014 this is a series of stars, big names with big accomplishments.\n\nBellinger, Rendon, Max Scherzer, Clayton Kershaw, Trea Turner, Justin Turner, Stephen Strasburg, Max Muncy, Patrick Corbin, Corey Seager, Joc Pederson, Juan Soto, Hyun-Jin Ryu \u2013 MVP candidates, Cy Young contenders, All-Stars and near All-Stars.\n\nThis series is a showcase of baseball\u2019s best.\n\nNo two inning star middle relievers here. This is old school, where starting pitchers \u2013 the main eventers of baseball \u2014 take the ball and, at least by today\u2019s standards, try to go deep in games.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little ode to the old school sort of starters and get after it,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nThursday night, Corbin will have to be the old school starter for Washington, taking the ball for Game 1.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty confident that Pat\u2019s ready to go, so let\u2019s focus on just winning the game tomorrow,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said, moving on from Tuesday night\u2019s dramatic 4-3 comeback win over Milwaukee in the wild card game and putting the spotlight on this star-studded series.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
