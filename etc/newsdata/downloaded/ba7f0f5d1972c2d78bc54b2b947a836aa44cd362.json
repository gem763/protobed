Wouldn't [another series] be nice? Coleen. We used to get accused of being hyperbole you know!\n\n'I can tell you there were times we were writing stories where honest to God there'd be news stories on the radio where I'd have to stop what I was doing because the writing happened prior to shooting and by the time it went out it would look like we had stolen the story on the radio'.\n\nAlarming: On Wednesday, Coleen, 33, released an incredible social media statement aimed at Rebekah, revealing how she set up an elaborate sting on Instagram to 'catch' her leaking fake stories - in a move that sparked mass scandal\n\nShe said: 'I remember one time I had to call a producer saying \"What do I do? Do I write this because it will be old news by this time?'\n\nShedding light on the show and it's empowering ways, she went on: 'I'll make no mistake it was subversively feminist...\n\n'It was a fabulously fertile ground where we could explore this zeitgeist moment when celeb magazine culture was growing beyond the vanity pieces for actors singers and royals. It was't just OK! Magazine anymore smoothing feathers...\n\n'It was Heat Magazine being b****y. Big Brother was still a phenomenon, the internet was finding its feet and among this was a world of vast footballers salaries and youngbuck athletes...\n\nFuming: Rebekah (pictured in September) has said other people have access to her account as she appeared to be pointing the finger at her inner circle\n\n'Then there were their girlfriends and wives who could buy new faces and bodies to become these alpha females against these alpha males. that's a massively complex thing to want to examine but basically a load of thinking feminists'.\n\nIn a fantastic twist, Nick then demanded that she 'get back to writing'.\n\nWith social media awash with memes and videos, Laila and Sarah delighted fans by getting in on the action by sharing clips from the show.\n\nLaila shared a memorable scene in which Zoe Lucker's character Tanya Turner was surveying video footage to catch out her love rival Amber after the Bollywood actress faked her own kidnap in a bid to win the heart of her husband Conrad Gates.\n\nShock: Moreover, Wayne and Rebekah's footballer husband Jamie are also close friends and were pictured hugging one another at the same England vs Wales match - but it was previously claimed that Wayne had warned Jamie about his wife\n\nShocker: Laila shared a memorable scene in which Zoe Lucker's character Tanya Turner was surveying video footage to catch out her love rival Amber\n\nHitting back: She later shared another video while brawling with Tanya with the words: 'Actual footage of the players' lounge at the next England game', while adding the caption : 'Waaaaaay ahead of our time'\n\nAbove the video, read: 'Coleen managing her Instagram account'.\n\nShe later shared another video while brawling with Tanya with the words: 'Actual footage of the players' lounge at the next England game', while adding the caption : 'Waaaaaay ahead of our time'.\n\nSarah meanwhile posted a clip as her character Shannon was locked in a cat fight with Amber, as they brawled in the Earls Park players' lounge.\n\nShe added a caption on the video reading: 'I hear there is a Wag War!! Sounds like a storyline from our Footballers Wives days! @lailarouass @coleen_rooney'.\n\nSarah's involvement is particularly poignant as she was tipped as a parody to Coleen, ne\u00e9 McLoughlin, when she joined the show as the fresh-faced teen sweetheart of Liverpudlian team newbie Harley Lawson, played by Jamie Davis.\n\nShock: Sarah's involvement is particularly poignant as she was tipped as a parody to Coleen, ne\u00e9 McLoughlin (the Wikipedia entry detailing the likeness)", "description": "Fans of the show will undoubtedly be delighted to hear that one of the show's writers and producers Liz Lake appeared on\u00a0BBC Radio 4's Today programme", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19534888-0-image-a-7_1570705076038.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
