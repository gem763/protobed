(AP) - Jamie Newman came up with a pair of big plays on a clock-draining fourth-quarter drive, helping Wake Forest hold off North Carolina\u2019s comeback bid for a 24-18 win Friday night.\n\nNewman hit Scotty Washington for a 27-yard gain, then had a 4-yard scramble on third down to keep possession to help the Demon Deacons (3-0) take 5 minutes off the clock and add a field goal to a dwindling lead.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t finish it the way I\u2019d like us to,\u201d Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson said, \u201cbut we made one play at the end.\u201d\n\nUNC (2-1) had a final drive with no timeouts with a chance for a third straight fourth-quarter comeback, but the game ended when Michael Carter didn\u2019t get out of bounds in time on a run to set up a final desperation heave from just across midfield.\n\nWake Forest dominated the first half to lead 21-0, only to see freshman quarterback Sam Howell lead the Tar Heels on two fourth-quarter TD drives to get back in it.\n\n\u201cThe first half, we didn\u2019t feel like ourselves,\u201d Howell said. \u201cMost of that is because of me. I didn\u2019t play very well in the first half. We just fought as hard as we could in the second half and ended up running out of time.\u201d\n\nThe win came in an unusual setting: a game between instate Atlantic Coast Conference teams that was designated as a nonconference matchup that didn\u2019t count in the league standings. The teams had agreed in 2015 to play this year and in 2021 instead of waiting until 2022 for their next ACC matchup amid the 14-team league\u2019s scheduling rotation for teams in opposite divisions.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUNC: After comebacks against South Carolina and Miami, the Tar Heels finally dug themselves a hole they couldn\u2019t come back from. They spent the first half getting beaten up front, with the Demon Deacons shutting down UNC\u2019s run game and moving the ball effectively on the ground and through the air. Howell threw two fourth-quarter TD passes to get UNC within 21-18 with 6:09 left, but the defense couldn\u2019t come up with a quick stop to get the ball back quickly.\n\nWake Forest: The good news is Wake Forest spent much of this one pushing the Tar Heels around, with Kenneth Walker running for 94 yards and receiver Sage Surratt having a career-best day with nine catches for 169 yards and a 51-yard TD catch from Newman. And the defense didn\u2019t allow a third-down conversion until well into the third quarter. The bad news is Wake Forest didn\u2019t finish particularly well, watching a well-in-hand game get unexpectedly tense in the final minutes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUNC: The Tar Heels return home to host Appalachian State on Sept. 21.\n\nWake Forest: The Demon Deacons host Elon on Sept. 21.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jamie Newman came up with a pair of big plays on a clock-draining fourth-quarter drive, helping Wake Forest hold off North Carolina's comeback bid for a 24-18 win Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Beard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/north_carolina_wake_forest_football_00827_c0-188-4499-2811_s1770x1032.jpg?4522a686ae00fa7120922d59435c65d62506273b", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
