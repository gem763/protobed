During some of the unrest, specialized units of the U.N.-backed Haitian National Police were ransacked and looted and two police vehicles set on fire.\n\nAnti-government demonstrations turned especially violent in February, when the United Nations said 41 people were killed and another 100 injured. Police say at least five people have been killed in clashes in the past few weeks, but Moise has given no indication he intends to resign.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland this week condemned all violence in Haiti, and the U.N. reiterated earlier calls for calm.
