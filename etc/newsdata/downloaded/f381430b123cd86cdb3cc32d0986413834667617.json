He expressed concern that this may cause \u201ca surge of so-called reverse migration of terrorists back to their homeland.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkish op in Syria may lead to \u2018reverse migration\u2019 of terrorists to their homelands, Russian defense minister warns\n\nSome of these IS fighters were from Chechnya and other republics in southern Russia, but Kadyrov says they should think twice about coming back.\n\n\u201cChechnya is ready to ensure security in our region. We have prepared special units to do so,\u201d he told Russia\u2019s Channel 1. \u201cWe\u2019re not what we used to be in the 1990s,\u201d the Chechen leader added, referring to a large-scale radical Islamist insurgency in the republic during that period.\n\nWe\u2019ll gladly accept [IS militants], but it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019ll get tickets to the theater or the cemetery.\n\nThe \u201cdevils\u201d from IS aren\u2019t religious fanatics trying to build their own caliphate, Kadyrov said, but just \u201cmercenaries, trained on money from Western secret services, whose task is to follow orders.\u201d\n\nThere will definitely be an attempt to use terrorists who escaped from prisons in northern Syria against Russia, the Chechen leader said. \u201cThe aim of the US, Europe \u2013 the West \u2013 is to destroy our sovereign state. They tried doing it through Chechnya; through Ossetia; through Georgia; through Ukraine,\u201d but they will never succeed, he stated.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
