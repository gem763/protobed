It led to calls for Bulgaria to be kicked out of the competition and for players to walk off in similar circumstances.\n\nThe QPR players did just that after claiming a number were subjected to racist abuse during the second-half of their friendly in Seville. After one player informed Furlong he decided to take his team off.", "description": "Queens Park Rangers have said they are \u201cdisgusted, embarrassed and dismayed\u201d over the way football\u2019s governing bodies Uefa and Fifa have handled an allegation of racism that led to the club abandoning an Under-18s game.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/30/214428511_Getty-Images-Europe_Queens-Park-Rangers-v-Brentford-Sky-Bet-Championship-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkYCR5Nfj9Bfv-q8ZwekFu7-tVlBuuD9n-JBBa0mXWHY.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
