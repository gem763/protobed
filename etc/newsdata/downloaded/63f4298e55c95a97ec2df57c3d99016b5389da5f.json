Or as they say in some wonky circles on Wall Street: \u201cNegative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP).\u201d\n\nSure, it\u2019s enticing to think about the prospect of buying momentum stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM) and Beyond Meat (BYND) on cheap credit to juice the prospect for robust returns. But if you think about it, none of those often high-flying stocks would likely be hot trades in the world of NIRP because the U.S. economy would probably be sucking wind.\n\n\u201cThe necessary condition for negative interest rates to happen is that we have got to go into a recession. The first thing that would happen is that the Fed would cut rates all the way back to zero. The second thing that would happen is that they would start to ramp up quantitative easing and then potentially after that, you could go negative,\u201d acting Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u2018The First Trade.\u2019\n\nBryson continued, \u201cKnowing what I know today, the probability of that is certainly not zero, but I think it\u2019s pretty low as well. I think you would have to get yourself into a fairly deep recession for us to even start thinking about going to zero.\u201d\n\nYet here we are investors, staring down the barrel of 0% interest rates in the U.S. by mid-2020.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates again by 25 basis points to a new target range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday. It represented the second \u201cinsurance rate cut\u201d by the Fed this year, and comes on the heels of slowdowns in U.S. manufacturing and the job market in large part from effects of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nNegative rates haven\u2019t really boost economies\n\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda speaks during a press conference in Tokyo on September 19, 2019. - The Bank of Japan on September 19 warned of increasing downside risks for the global economy but held off on further easing, even as European and US peers loosen their credit grip. (Photo by STR / JIJI PRESS / AFP) / Japan OUT (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nThe market should ask itself if NIRP by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have worked at all.\n\nECB chief Mario Draghi just slashed interest rates to -0.5% and left the door open to doing more. European Union economies are barely growing despite the rock bottom rates. Gross Domestic Product fell 0.1% in Germany in the second quarter alone.\n\nOn Thursday, the Bank of Japan held rates steady at -0.1%. It, too, signaled it would be willing to do more easing to try and jump start economic growth. After years of a NIRP policy, Japan was only able to eke out 1.8% GDP growth in the second quarter.\n\nThat\u2019s awful considering those low interest rates. But again, it reflects both economies not being in good shape.\n\n\u201cWe have joked internally that NIRP is the upside down of the \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 hit on Netflix. It\u2019s unfortunate because once you get to the upside down world of NIRP, it\u2019s very difficult to get your way out of it. We are seeing that with the ECB and certainly with the Bank of Japan,\u201d says PNC Financial Chief Investment Officer Amanda Agati.\n\nIn the end, be careful what you wish for from the Fed.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
