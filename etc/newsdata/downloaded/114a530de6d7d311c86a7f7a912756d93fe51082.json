Probably the latter.\n\nAndrew McCabe, who\u2019s currently facing a coming indictment for lying to the FBI (while also moonlighting as a CNN analyst of course), did an interview on his time at the FBI during the Trump-Russia investigation. Along the way, he made a pretty important admission regarding the origins of the probe.\n\n\u201dWe open the case, and then we think, \u2018OK, now who are we actually going to investigate? Who do we know who is associated with the campaign who has known, significant ties to Russian intelligence? We quickly come up with four names.\u201d 3 from the dossier: https://t.co/nwHIs0aA4m \u2014 Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) October 11, 2019\n\nMcCabe said the FBI opened its case in late July 2016 based on information about Trump adviser George Papadopoulos. \u201cWe open the case, and then we think, \u2018OK, now who are we actually going to investigate?\u2019\u201d McCabe said at the event, which aired Tuesday on C-SPAN. \u201cWho do we know who is associated with the campaign who has known, significant ties to Russian intelligence?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cWe quickly come up with four names that will not surprise you.\u201d\n\nWait, so they started the investigation without even knowing who they were going to investigate? Why, it\u2019s almost as if they were simply fishing around Trump\u2019s campaign for political reasons.\n\nSeriously though, that\u2019s probably something he shouldn\u2019t be saying out loud, as it confirms what most of us have been saying for years. This entire fiasco started without probable cause under the false pretenses of a counter intelligence investigation, which effectively removed all guardrails on Comey and McCabe. Instead of having a crime or action to go on, they simply started chumming the waters and filling in the blanks as they went.\n\nIf you listen carefully, McCabe is admitting he had **no predicate at all to open a full enterprise CI investigation** \u2014PapaD: vague Downer tip \u2014Flynn: he sat next to Putin \u2014Page: Russians tried to recruit him years ago (and failed) \u2014Manafort: He worked in Ukraine for money \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) October 11, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s also no coincidence that three of their first four targets came from the Steele dossier. In this same interview, McCabe sought to defend the document even as it\u2019s been exposed as the dumpster fire that it is.\n\nHe also sought to defend Steele and his salacious dossier, which the FBI used to obtain surveillance warrants on Page. \u201cIt is raw source reporting,\u201d McCabe said, \u201cand Steele presented it as such.\u201d \u201cWe knew that Steele was working a number of different sources, some of which has sub-sources, and sub-sub-sources, and he would represent that in the reporting, as any good source should. It didn\u2019t come with his imprimatur of, \u2018this is all gospel.\u2019 It was like, \u2018this is what I\u2019m hearing,\u2019\u201d said McCabe, who is under Justice Department investigation. \u201cThat\u2019s how good sources report.\u201d\n\nIt should scare everyone that this guy was at the highest levels of ensuring national security. \u201cThat\u2019s how good sources report?\u201d By funneling abject garbage sourced from Russians that was so ridiculous that it was nearly all debunked the moment it went public? If that\u2019s true then we should just disband the FBI because they suck at their jobs. They treated the Steele dossier as legitimate for months while it took news outlets a few days to tear most of it apart. That\u2019s America\u2019s best and brightest? Or perhaps just most partisan.\n\nThis guy needs to be brought down hard. If he walks after all this, justice is truly not blind in this country.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
