Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said withholding funding was \"absolutely appropriate.\" (Oct. 17) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Former Ohio Governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate John Kasich said Friday he now supports impeaching President Donald Trump.\n\nKasich said it was White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitting there was a quid pro quo between the United States and Ukraine that \u201cpushed me really across the Rubicon.\u201d\n\nDuring a rare White House press briefing, Mulvaney told reporters on Thursday, \"Did (Trump) also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely... That's it. That's why we held up the money,\" acknowledging the White House had frozen military aid as leverage over Ukraine.\n\nMore: Trump's Syria-Turkey cease-fire, Rick Perry resigns, the death of Elijah Cummings: What to know from Thursday\n\n\"Withholding military aid, vital military aid to a nation like Ukraine, which has Russian troops inside its territory, that\u2019s threatened all the time, withholding it so that a political operation can take place \u2013 'investigate this thing around the server, and we\u2019re going to withhold the aid until you do that\u2019 \u2013 to me, it's totally inappropriate. It\u2019s an abuse of power.\" Kasich said during an interview on CNN.\n\n\"Does this rise to the level of impeachment? I now believe it does...

I now believe that it does and I say it with, I say it with great sadness. This is not something I really wanted to do,\u201d he continued.\n\nKasich also noted he voted to impeach President Bill Clinton when he was a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nKasich said he would want to see and consider the House's articles of impeachment, and expressed disagreement with how House Democrats have conducted their investigation thus far.\n\n\"But if you\u2019re asking if I was sitting in the House of Representatives today and you were to ask me, how do I feel, do I think impeachment should move forward and go for a full examination and trial of the United States Senate? My vote would be yes. I don\u2019t say it lightly,\" Kasich said.\n\nMore: House Republicans complain about limited access to closed-door House impeachment investigation sessions\n\nThe impeachment inquiry began last month after a whistleblower accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nKasich has been a critic of Trump since facing him in 2016 and previously said he was \"very seriously\" considering running against him as a primary challenger in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is extremely difficult for me, but it\u2019s what I feel I have to do,\" Kasich said during his CNN interview. \"It\u2019s what my conscience tells me.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/18/john-kasich-president-trump-should-impeached/4024401002/", "description": "\"I\u00a0say it with great sadness,\u201d the former Ohio governor said of impeaching President Trump.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
