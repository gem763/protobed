Trump's son Eric also criticised Joe and Hunter Biden, suggesting the 'lock her up' chant referencing Hillary Clinton should be switched to 'lock him up' for the Bidens. Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar was singled out by Trump as 'an American-hating socialist'. Trump then turned to the Somali refugee community in Minnesota, which Omar is from, saying: 'Leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia ... without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers'", "description": "Trump launches vulgar attacks on Bidens, Somali refugees and Ilhan Omar at Minnesota rally", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7e8f5028aacb1ca0f0729702874bc07f204092/0_184_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c3739b4376c1fb90e5fe9ff10aa3a1e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
