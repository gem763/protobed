However, the true figure will be far higher since less than half of police forces in England responded.\n\nGreater Manchester Police received the highest number, with 5,574 reports of assaults in schools since 2015.\n\nOf the 1,448 reports at schools in greater Manchester, 206 cited teachers or headteachers as victims, while classroom assistants, support workers, children and students were also listed.\n\nEarlier this year, it emerged that school staff are increasingly refusing to teach unruly children amid incidents of violence and sexual assault.\n\nThe number of \u201crefusal to teach\u201d ballots has doubled in the past five years, according to data from the teaching union National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers.\n\nUnder a \u201crefusal to teach\u201d ballot, staff in a particular school can take industrial action as a last resort, to protest against the behaviour of a particular pupil. They can also take action short of a strike, which could involve refusing to cover lessons for colleagues or take on voluntary duties.", "description": "Police are increasingly being called in to quell school violence as assaults in schools soar by 72 per cent in four years, data shows.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Daniel Hannan", "Rebecca Ryan", "Marcus Fysh", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000175986675-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
