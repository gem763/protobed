The expression 'a bolt from the blue' would be appropriate,\" she said, when asked for her reaction when she heard about the plan.\n\nShe said the Tokyo government was looking at counter-proposals, including starting the events earlier, though not as early as 3 a.m.\n\n\"There is such a plan, some reports say 3 a.m., but that would not be the case,\" she said, without specifying further.\n\nThe IOC's announcement appeared to take Japanese officials across the board by surprise, with the mayor of Sapporo saying he had not been consulted either.\n\nTokyo has spent heavily on heat mitigation measures, including coating the route of the marathon with material that is supposed to reduce the impact of the city's notoriously warm and sticky summer weather.\n\nAnd some tickets have already been sold, raising additional complications.\n\n\"There are voices among Tokyo residents who want explanations as to why this situation is occurring, and if a word from on high simply decides everything,\" Koike said.\n\nThe governor is expected to meet later Friday with John Coates, chairman of the IOC's Coordination Commission.\n\nHe has defended the proposed move, while acknowledging it \"came as a bit of (a) surprise\" for the Tokyo organizers.\n\nThe decision came after the recent world championships in Doha, when both the men's and women's marathons started at midnight but heat and humidity still presented massive problems.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Tokyo Gov Yuriko Koike's governor said Friday she opposes moving next year's Olympic marathon and race-walking events to Hokkaido over heat fears, describing the proposal as a \"bolt from the blue.\" The International Olympic Committee announced earlier this month it would propose shifting the marathon and race walking to Sapporo\u2026", "authors": ["Tom Young", "Alexander Yushchenko", "Vince Black", "Englisc Aspyrgend"], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/77/7a/b34b52a5ed300b5f104d43eb64a1cdfe8c98/777ab34b52a5ed300b5f104d43eb64a1cdfe8c98.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
