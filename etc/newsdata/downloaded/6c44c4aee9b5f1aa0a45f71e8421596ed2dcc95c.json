Disney\u2019s \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil,\u201d a sequel to 2014\u2019s fantasy adventure based on the \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d sorceress, debuted to $36 million from 2,790 North American theatres, nearly half of what the first movie made in its inaugural weekend ($69 million).\n\nActor Angelina Jolie attends the UK premiere of \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" in London, Britain October 9, 2019. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nDespite opening below projections heading into the weekend, \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d easily towered over competition including holdover from Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cJoker\u201d and newcomer Sony\u2019s \u201cZombieland: Double Tap.\u201d The \u201cMaleficent\u201d follow-up did benefit as one of the few offerings catering to younger female moviegoers in a marketplace that\u2019s been largely dominated by male-skewed titles like \u201cJoker\u201d and Paramount\u2019s \u201cGemini Man.\u201d Women represented 56% of ticket buyers, about 50% of which were under the age of 25.\n\n\u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d marks the lowest opening weekend of the year for Disney and will now rely on the international box office to recoup its $185 million budget. The film had much more promising showing overseas, lifting off with $117 million for a global start of $150 million. The original pulled in an impressive $517 million from foreign markets and another $241 million from the domestic market.\n\nElle Fanning also returned for the sequel, joining newcomers to the series Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Skrein and Chiwetel Ejiofor. \u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil\u201d was directed by Joachim Ronning (\u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales\u201d).\n\nFellow new release \u201cZombieland: Double Tap\u201d launched at No. 3 with a better-than-expected $26.7 million and should continue to build momentum in coming weeks as Halloween nears. The original \u201cZombieland\u201d premiered to $24 million in 2009 and ended its box office run with a solid $102 million globally. Directed by Ruben Fleischer, the zombie comedy reunites stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin and Bill Murray. Rosario Dawson, Zoey Deutch, Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch joined the cast. \u201cZombieland 2\u201d cost $42 million to make, roughly double what the studio spent on the original ($23 million).\n\nAfter its two-week reign atop domestic box office charts, \u201cJoker\u201d slid to second place and added $29 million in its third weekend of release. That puts the dark supervillain origin story \u2014 starring Joaquin Phoenix and directed by Todd Phillips \u2014 close to the $250 million mark in North America, with ticket sales hitting $247 million. Overseas, \u201cJoker\u201d has scared up a mighty $490 million for a worldwide bounty of $737.5 million.\n\nIn other milestones, STX and Lorene Scafaria\u2019s \u201cHustlers\u201d crossed the coveted $100 million benchmark at the domestic box office. After six weeks in theatres, \u201cHustlers\u201d pulled in another $2 million, boosting its haul to $101.8 million in North America and $128.8 million globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Focus Features\u2019 \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d has surpassed $88 million in the States and now stands as the studio\u2019s highest-grossing movie ever at the domestic box office, a record previously held by \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d with $83 million.\n\nAmong awards season hopefuls, Fox Searchlight\u2019s \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d bowed with a strong $350,000 from five theatres in New York and Los Angeles, averaging $70,000 from each location. Written and directed by Taika Waititi (who also stars in the film as an absurdist imaginary Adolf Hitler), \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d is set during World War II and follows a young boy eager to join the Hitler Youth, who discovers his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their attic. Critics have been mostly impressed with \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d (it holds a 77% on Rotten Tomatoes), while audiences have awarded it with an A CinemaScore.\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons to be very optimistic about the future of \u2018Jojo Rabbit,\u2019\u201d said Frank Rodriguez, Fox Searchlight\u2019s president of domestic distribution. \u201cNotably, the very good performance at the box office this weekend, the excellent CinemaScore of A, and the interest that we see from exhibitors and moviegoers who are eager to play and see the film in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d based on the novel \u201cCaging Skies,\u201d will continue its paced rollout next weekend in eight new markets, including Denver, Austin, Phoenix, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Toronto. The studio is aiming for a nationwide release by Nov. 8. The cast includes Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Rebel Wilson and Sam Rockwell.\n\nElsewhere, Robert Eggers\u2019 \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d took in $419,764 from eight venues. The darkly comedic drama, led by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, will continue to expand nationwide next weekend, where it will play on 500 screens.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Five years after Angelina Jolie's \"Maleficent\" cast a spell over the box office, the villainous enchantress has returned to the top of domestic charts.
