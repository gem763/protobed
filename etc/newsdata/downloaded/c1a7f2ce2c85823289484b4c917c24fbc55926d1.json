Netflix has launched with 30 employees and 925 DVD titles available to rent. Amazon has just announced its intention to expand beyond selling books online. And Seinfeld, the hugely popular sitcom about daily life in New York City, has wrapped its ninth and final season on NBC.\n\nCould it BE any funnier? The 25 best Friends episodes Read more\n\nAt the time, the enduring appeal of Seinfeld seemed so assured that Turner Broadcasting paid a record sum, over $1m per episode, for the right to broadcast reruns on its channel TBS. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s important to realize the scope of the hit that this show is and the broadcast networks\u2019 inability to continue to generate big, megahit shows like that,\u201d said Bill Burke, the then president of TBS, at the time of the deal\u2019s announcement.\n\nTwenty-one years later, Burke\u2019s statement is not quite prophetic \u2013 networks have produced numerous mega-hits, such as The Big Bang Theory and The Office, since Seinfeld went off the air \u2013 but not wrong, either. Much has changed (Netflix\u2019s business, Amazon\u2019s products) but Seinfeld, along with its fellow NBC stalwart Friends, remains broadly popular and inordinately valuable; last month, Netflix paid over $500m for the rights to stream all of Seinfeld\u2019s 180 episodes globally.\n\nThe sky-high sum for the show about nothing is one of several giant deals in recent months for library rights to legacy shows, representing a new, cash-laden front on the global streaming wars. In July, WarnerMedia outbid Netflix with $425m for all 10 seasons of Friends, which will stream on its forthcoming service HBO Max in spring 2020. A month earlier, Netflix also lost the rights to The Office, one of its most popular shows, to NBCUniversal, who paid $500m to stream the show for five years on its own forthcoming service, Peacock, in 2021. (Netflix will maintain global rights.) And in a deal said to be pushing $1bn, WarnerMedia has secured both the streaming rights (on HBO Max) and broadcast syndication (on TBS) for The Big Bang Theory, the nerd sitcom that ended its run on CBS last year.\n\nThese pricey deals for what is essentially digital reruns have, like the Seinfeld syndication deal two decades ago, raised eyebrows. Why are streaming companies willing to pay so much for shows of nostalgic value? And as numerous companies prepare to launch their own streaming services \u2013 HBO Max and Peacock, not to mention the forthcoming Apple TV+ \u2013 why bet on the appeal of legacy TV shows?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Friends still rakes in $1bn a year in syndication revenue on local networks, TBS and Viacom-owned channels such as MTV.

And you have more bidders than ever before, so the result is sky-high pricing.\u201d\n\nThese deals are, in part, an old story, the updated and more comprehensive version of the syndication bidding wars that have long defined rerun television. The popularity of the most juggernaut sitcoms, in particular Friends and Seinfeld, have not demonstrated a reason to be questioned. Seinfeld, which has gone through three rounds of syndication (a round being the amount of time it takes to air all of a show\u2019s episodes on broadcast schedule), has reportedly made over $3bn in rerun deals, with TBS believed to be paying about $350,000 \u2013 $400,000 per episode in this cycle. Friends still rakes in $1bn a year in syndication revenue on local networks, TBS and Viacom-owned channels such as MTV, where it\u2019s become a ratings boost with viewers younger than the show itself.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory deal with HBO Max, coming right at the end of the show\u2019s run, is \u201cvery akin to what we\u2019ve seen before in syndication\u201d, said Greenfield. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new about this \u2013 obviously, these are new platforms, compared to the past, but the concept of key library TV shows having tremendous value has always been true.\u201d\n\nThe deals have higher values and more bidders than in the past, but the setup is \u201creally no different than if you think about 10 years ago, with TV syndication,\u201d said Greenfield. \u201cThose bidding wars looked just like the bidding wars you\u2019re seeing now.\u201d\n\nBut these shows\u2019 popularity is newly remarkable given the increasingly niche-driven television market and their popularity with viewers who were too young to watch or not even born when they aired. Friends is arguably one of the hottest shows for Gen Z, loosely defined as the generation born between 1996 and 2010. The 25th anniversary of its premiere last month launched an outpouring of nostalgic content, a lucrative three-night theatrical event, and vociferous online blowback as to whether the show is any good in the first place. Netflix is notoriously tight-lipped on streaming numbers, but according to Nielsen, The Office and Friends were the most-streamed shows on the platform this year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Gen Z viewers are experiencing The Office and Friends with a kind of urgency that they\u2019ve never really had in their lives,\u2019 says the critic Daniel D\u2019Addario. Photograph: NBCUPHOTOBANK / Rex Features\n\nGiven the shows\u2019 hundreds of episodes and low barriers to entry, \u201cGen Z viewers are experiencing The Office and Friends with a kind of urgency and viewing experience that they\u2019ve never really had in their lives,\u201d said Daniel D\u2019Addario, chief TV critic for Variety. He attributes their success to their blend of palatability and humor; as more and more shows are designed for increasingly niche audiences, it\u2019s comforting to turn on and tune out. \u201cThese shows are really built to satisfy your viewing \u2013 they\u2019re big, broad, fun, easygoing. Still well-crafted shows, but shows that are not hard to access.\u201d They\u2019re not, say, Mad Men, the prestige drama whose streaming rights will be shopped by Lionsgate, in a test of how much a library of hour-long, less binge-able episodes can be valued as a tentpole attraction. (Netflix originally bought the streaming rights in 2011 for $1m per episode.)\n\nThus the eye-popping deals from streaming services on classic sitcoms represent a paradox of the television landscape in 2019: as the glut of Peak TV, spurred by streamers\u2019 massive budgets for original programs, produces more and more niche content, the more valuable shows with broad appeal become to streaming services. Netflix\u2019s Seinfeld deal was especially ironic, wrote the TV critic Alison Herman for the Ringer, because it demonstrated how the company whose \u201cmaximum-volume production is predicated on the idea of catering to every possible niche is all but admitting it depends on the old-school hit it\u2019s helped make harder to create than ever\u201d.\n\nWhich makes the success of these shows behind several different streaming barriers \u2013 be it HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu or Peacock \u2013 more of an open question. Show such as Friends and The Office gained legions of viewers after their runs \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult to assess the balance of inherent appeal versus accessibility. \u201cRight now, Friends is extremely appealing, likely in part because it\u2019s on Netflix,\u201d said D\u2019Addario. For many viewers, it\u2019s already there. \u201cWhen you have to pay a separate bill to the service that has Friends,\u201d along with other content too, \u201cwould that be a deal that you\u2019re willing to make?\u201d", "description": "Seinfeld, Friends, The Office \u2013 with an ever-increasing wave of new content, why are TV streamers paying hundreds of millions for classic comedies?", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61975d94c9a8378a45c7bf234c8884c80ac1c3ef/0_94_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b30be7e78e9237b07d5e246ef94a48d7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
