He wants to be the master of puppets; he wants to rule the world. It might sound crazy, but it\u2019s a fact, it\u2019s true\u201d Tarczy\u0144ski insisted, referring to billionaire plutocrat George Soros, and Soros-endorsed efforts by the European Union to redistribute migrants throughout the continent via compulsory quotas \u2014 which Poland\u2019s left-liberal opposition (Civic Platform, or PO, now Civic Coalition) signed up to in 2015 while it was still in government, only for PiS to sweep them out of office weeks later and refuse to implement them.\n\nSoros\u2019s supporters have long claimed he is merely a wealthy philanthropist and dismissed his detractors as conspiracy theorists, but the billionaire did confess in his 1987 book The Alchemy of Finance that he \u201calways harboured an exaggerated view of my self-importance\u201d and \u201cfancied myself as some kind of god\u201d from an early age.\n\n\u201cMy sense of reality was strong enough to make me realize that these expectations were excessive and I kept them hidden as a guilty secret,\u201d he said, revealing that this \u201cwas a source of considerable unhappiness through much of my adult life\u201d \u2014 but, as he \u201cmade [his] way in the world\u201d and acquired a vast fortune, \u201creality came close enough to my fantasy to allow me to admit my secret, at least to myself.\u201d\n\nPolish lawmaker slams Vienna's leftist govt for politically correct rejection of statue to Polish king who saved city from Turkish siege: \u201cIf not for Sobieski, your wives and daughters would live under an Islamic caliphate.

They hate values, they hate virtues, and we are fighting for values and virtues. They don\u2019t like it. They like Muslims, they like cheap labour, and [migrants] who will vote for them \u2014 but it\u2019s not going to happen; we\u2019re going to save Europe, and I\u2019m serious about it.\u201d\n\nPolish Lawmaker Backs Burqa Ban, No Saudi Mosques in Europe Until Poland Can Build Cathedral in Saudi Arabia https://t.co/7yXicZMSMg \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 28, 2018\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "The left is attacking Poland's conservative govt ahead of national elections because it \"damages the Soros Plan\", says\u00a0Dominik Tarczy\u0144ski.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Soros-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
