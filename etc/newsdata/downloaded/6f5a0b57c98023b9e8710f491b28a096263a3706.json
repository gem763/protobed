The way we eat, dress, talk and live our lives have helped shape the world today - our cultural history is just as important as our physical.\n\nTo celebrate this facet of the human psyche, Wesgro teamed up with the Department of Economic Development and Tourism (DEDAT), the provincial Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport (DCAS) and the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site (WHS) to develop the Cradle of Human Culture route in the Western Cape.\n\nSet to launch on 11 April, the route will connect sites that have delivered us modern humans remnants of our early ancestors' culture and show how the story developed after starting in the Cradle of Humankind.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that the Cradle of Human Culture will become a tool for all South Africans to enjoy these beautiful sites, explore our common origins, dive into our past and understand what makes us humans,\" says the Director for Museums, Heritage and Geographical Names Services at DCAS, Mxolisi Dlamuka.\n\n\"Through this journey, visitors to the Cradle of Human Culture will discover the enormous contribution that South Africa played in making us all humans.\"\n\nALSO SEE: 8 Sites in other countries that salute SA\n\nTo launch the route, a micro-site will be developed with detailed information on this educational journey. To support marketing the initiative, a short video, imagery and a booklet will be shared on social media channels and other digital platforms before the launch.\n\n\u201cThe Cradle of Humankind WHS celebrates the human journey, from our earliest beginnings - to the challenges of our present - to our uncertain future,\" comments Michael Worsnip, managing director of Maropeng.\n\n\"It celebrates human development, in every shape and form. It is wonderful indeed to now have established a new showcase for this diversity, complexity and unity of our species, in the newly established Cradle of Human Culture. It is possible that in our arts and crafts, beliefs and extraordinary ingenuity, we can start to uncover some of the defining characteristics of our species.\"\n\nSEE: Makhonjwa Barberton Mountains confirmed as SA's newest World Heritage Site\n\nHere are some of the sites that will feature on the route:\n\nBlombos Cave\n\nThis archaeological site near De Hoop Nature Reserve, alongside Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof, are in the process of being nominated for WHS status for their preservation of the world's earliest evolution of modern human behaviour.\n\nOne of the biggest finds in this cave is a small stone marked with abstract designs - claimed to be the oldest-known example of human drawing from 73 000 years ago.\n\nPinnacle Point Site Complex\n\nNear the south coast town of Mossel Bay, a series of caves have yielded the cultural remnants of Middle Stone Age humans that dwelt there between 170 000 and 40 000 years ago.\n\nYou can take a guided tour to the caves which is now situated on the Pinnacle Point Beach and Golf Resort.\n\nREAD: Western Cape discovers its own cradle of humankind\n\nDiepkloof Rock Shelter\n\nThis one is more inland near Elands Bay and is famous for its early evidence of humans using symbols, engraved on ostrich eggshells used to house water by our ancestors.\n\nThese patterns consisted of repetitions of motifs, proving that something was being communicated in a cultural context to the social group that used to live there.\n\nWest Coast Fossil Park\n\nOn the road to Langebaan, you can check out the remains of fearsome creatures that roamed the West Coast millions of years ago.\n\nBesides learning more about the creatures that came before humans, you'll also get a chance to look for fossils - just like a real archaeologist.\n\nZeits MOCAA\n\nNot all stops on the route will look into the past - the Zeits MOCAA in Cape Town offers an artistic glimpse into Africa's present dynamics and how the past can mould our future.\n\nSouth Africans enjoy free entry on Wednesdays between 10:00 and 13:00 and children under 18 can get in for free all the time.\n\nSEE: Zeits MOCAA Opening: Highly anticipated, rather hair-raising!?\n\nFind Your Escape by searching and comparing flight prices here.
