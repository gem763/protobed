He was trail riding with friends when he suffered a fatal head injury. He was 36.\n\nLifelong friend Darren Berrecloth was with him.\n\n\"We were having a great day. Riding bikes, laughing, giggling,\" says Berrecloth. \"It's better he died riding his bike than in a plane crash or something horrible like that.\"\n\nJordie Lunn riding in Baja, Mexico. (Darren Berrecloth)\n\nJordie Lunn grew up in Parksville, B.C., where he started BMX riding as a child. That soon turned to mountain biking, in which he competed internationally.\n\nEventually, Lunn took up trick riding. He performed incredible feats on ramps and trails built in the forests of Vancouver Island.\n\nJarrett Lunn says his older brother loved mountain biking.\n\n\"He spent his whole life on two wheels,\" he said. \"If he wasn't riding his bike, he was out with a shovel and a rake, building, just spending time in the forest.\"\n\nLunn built mountain- and dirt-biking trails around the Island, together with his father and brothers, and a crew of friends. Among his accomplishments were the downhill biking trails at Bear Mountain Resort near Victoria.\n\n\"He was responsible for building some of the most epic downhill trails that our festival uses every year,\" said Jon Watkin, the director of the Bear Mountain Bike Festival.\n\nJordie Lunn also coached biking, as seen in this photo from 2012. (Sterling Lorence )\n\nFriends and family say he will be remembered for his warmth and openness.\n\n\"From the outside you looked at him, he had all the tattoos, he looked like a big scary dude,\" says Berrecloth. \"But he was actually the opposite. He was the biggest teddy bear on the planet.\"", "description": "Jordie Lunn, world renowned for his trick mountain biking, was trail riding with friends while filming a web series when he suffered a fatal head injury.
