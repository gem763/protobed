The Home Bargains discount empire has turned its founders into multi-billionaires, but you would be hard-pressed to name them despite their family fortune being greater than those of Sir Philip Green and Mike Ashley added together.\n\nBoth in their 60s, brothers Tom and Joe Morris are the cut-price high street kings with 500 shops and an empire valued at \u00a33.6bn. This week it emerged they had paid themselves \u00a310m last year, after their Woolworths-style chain - which sells everything from toiletries and dress-up costumes to furniture, cake mixes and \u00a31,000 outdoor pizza ovens - went from strength to strength despite grim high street trading conditions.\n\nAt a time when the big supermarkets are finding life tough and even some discount rivals are under pressure, Home Bargains made \u00a3233m profit last year, up 15%. The chain raked in sales of nearly \u00a32.5bn and set a target of building the business up to 1,000 stores.\n\nTom Morris, who owns 95% of Home Bargains parent TJ Morris, studiously avoids the limelight. One of the few photographs in circulation of Tom is the businessman awkwardly posing with some Morecambe pupils after being allowed to land his helicopter on their school field to visit a new store nearby.\n\nCheap and cheerful: why there\u2019s more to Primark\u2019s success than you thought Read more\n\n\u201cTom is very impressive,\u201d says one business associate. \u201cThere is a humility to him that is very admirable. He is very private and does not flaunt his wealth.\u201d\n\nAny public speaking \u2013 and there is very little of it \u2013 is left to Joe Morris, a younger brother and operations director. Joe\u2019s claims to fame include sponsoring the Liverpool tapestry created for the European Capital of Culture celebrations. At 7 metres (23ft) in length, the work comprises 338 panels and includes one he stitched himself \u2013 of a Home Bargains shop front.\n\nThe family appear to own few of the trophy baubles usually associated with vast wealth. There is, however, a private jet, with M-ORIS spelled out on the tail. Over the past year the aircraft \u2013 big enough to seat a dozen passengers \u2013 has regularly crisscrossed the UK, visited a remote region of Brazil and touched down in New Jersey.\n\nEven so, the Morris family are described as \u201cdown-to-earth\u201d people who would not want to alienate their customers and staff by living a flashy lifestyle.\n\nTom Morris, owner of Home Bargains.\n\nThe brothers are two of seven children of a Liverpool shopkeeper, Tom senior. That store was called V\u2019s after Veronica, their mother, and for \u201cvalue\u201d.\n\nTom junior opened a shop of his own in the Old Swan area of Liverpool in 1976 when he was just 21. His siblings initially sought other careers, with Joe, an engineering graduate, once explaining: \u201cI had never been further than holidays in Rhyl. I wanted to get away from shops and see a bit of the world.\u201d\n\nBut he eventually returned to the fold and became Home Bargains operations director. Their brother Ed, who had a computing doctorate, wrote software for the company, which is now said to have hi-tech warehouses envied by rivals. (He no longer works for the firm.) Another sibling, Anton, is a successful graphic artist who came up with the company\u2019s distinctive red and blue branding.\n\nHome Bargains has grown steadily and conservatively from its north-west base over the past 40 years. While many rival retailers are struggling under huge debt piles and are trying to cut their rent bills, Home Bargains is debt-free, owns many of its stores and insists it does not \u201cengage in aggressive tax planning\u201d. Last year it paid corporation tax of \u00a349m, nearly double the amount paid by Facebook\u2019s UK operations.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nOver the years Tom, who owns a flat in Liverpool\u2019s Albert Dock, has built a substantial commercial property empire, including shops on the city\u2019s swish Falkner Street. Another of his companies recently paid \u00a33.8m for a rail depot in Ashford, Kent.\n\nOn a mid-October Thursday afternoon, the Home Bargains store in Hounslow, west London, is doing a brisk trade with the after-school crowd. There are Halloween props galore, but in the neighbouring aisles it is already Christmas. The shelves are filled with decorations and cheesy festive knits.\n\nNatasha Stead is out with her father Tony, doing their weekly \u201cHome Bargains Shop\u201d. She calls it \u201cselective shopping\u201d and their eclectic haul includes dog food, jam and Coke.\n\n\u201cYou always pick up something,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think there is a stigma attached to shops which have the word \u2018bargain\u2019 in the title. But you can buy the branded stuff if you are worried. I don\u2019t worry about that though, I\u2019m a teacher and on a budget.\u201d\n\nThe Morris philosophy is simple: \u201cIf we can\u2019t sell it cheaper than the competition, we wouldn\u2019t sell it,\u201d Joe once told the Guardian, then added: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to sell stuff cheap \u2026 the hard part is making money out of it.\u201d\n\nThe chain\u2019s mantra is \u201ctop brands at bottom prices\u201d and like rivals such as Aldi, Lidl and Poundland, the business benefited from the 2008 financial crisis which opened the eyes of cash-strapped Britons from all income groups to the bargains to be had in discount stores. \u201cA lot of people are time-rich, money-poor and shop around,\u201d explained Joe.\n\nSuppliers are encouraged to turn up at the firm\u2019s head office in Gilmoss, Liverpool, where buyers make quick decisions. \u201cWhen you go on to the trading floor of their head office, it is all open plan and Tom\u2019s desk is the first one you come to,\u201d said one business associate.\n\nBut what does the future hold for the business? Tom, whose children work in the business, turned 65 this year while Joe is 60, so the question of succession looms large. City investment banks have been knocking on the Morrises\u2019 door, keen to sell the idea of a stock exchange listing, but, so far, they have not been tempted.", "description": "The down-to-earth family own Home Bargains, a debt-free chain of 500 shops valued at \u00a33.6bn", "authors": ["Zoe Wood", "Simon Goodley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba08bc7fda0610bade1565cbd1135b27cbba1cf/0_296_5447_3269/master/5447.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8006829af6d2658d92c98b2f80ab2e76", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
