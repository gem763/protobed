On this note, overall sentiment in the markets is positive as the S&P 500 is on the verge of breaking to record highs, and bonds fell sharply last week.\n\nThe improvement in sentiment has lessened the odds of easing this week, although the money markets continue to show about an 80% probability of an interest cut at Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nLast week, the ECB delivered a 10 basis point rate cut and introduced fresh quantitative easing. ECB President Mario Draghi emphasized the importance of fiscal stimulus and that monetary policy alone won\u2019t get the job done. Some analysts have translated this to mean that the central bank is essentially tapped out after implementing several unconventional policy measures.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe rally in EUR/USD post-ECB carried momentum behind it which signals the potential for a reversal. At the same time, a critical resistance level has held the pair lower.\n\nEURUSD 4-Hour Chart More\n\nResistance comes in the form of a declining trendline that originates from highs posted towards the end of June. EUR/USD tested the area on Friday and has since edged lower.\n\nThe first major level of support is found at 1.1060. This level was prior resistance that held the pair lower on a few attempts earlier in the month. In the event the exchange rate falls below it, the next area of interest falls at 1.1035.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEUR/USD is paring some gains after a sharp move higher last week.\n\nMajor support falls at 1.1060. A break exposes 1.1035.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on Wednesday and analyst are looking for a quarter-point interest rate cut . There is typically a slowing of volatility ahead of the meeting.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "After a sharp surge higher late last week on the back of the ECB meeting, EUR/USD is seen edging lower as sellers have defended critical technical resistance.", "authors": ["Jignesh Davda"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nxb5whQk8aFJqRjptDTlLQ--~B/aD0zNzY7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/43bd3549040d09e15269a32da0e094ca", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
