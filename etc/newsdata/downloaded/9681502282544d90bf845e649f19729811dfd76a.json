REUTERS/Costas Baltas\n\n\u201cOnce again, the few on strike are inconveniencing the many,\u201d Mitsotakis wrote on a Facebook post.\n\nUnionists believe the reforms will not help reduce unemployment, at about 17 percent the highest in the euro zone, or bring the amount of economic growth the government has promised. The bill is expected to be voted on this month.\n\n\u201cThose provisions must be withdrawn now,\u201d said GSEE, the country\u2019s largest labor union, which represents about 2.5 million workers.\n\nIn recent years turnout in rallies has been low, mainly due to fatigue after years of crisis that led to three international bailouts in exchange for pension and wage cuts, tax hikes and unpopular labor reforms.\n\nSome of the demonstrators on Wednesday protested against planned privatizations and the impact of bailout austerity. \u201cWe want jobs, not unemployment!\u201d, read one banner.\n\nGreece exited its third bailout program in 2018, two years after returning to growth.\n\nIts fiscal and reform progress is still being monitored by its lenders, including targets of primary surpluses for the next 40 years.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has called for further flexibility in the country\u2019s labor market and offering more options to employers to cut costs.\n\nMitsotakis\u2019 government has promised to negotiate a lowering of fiscal targets with European lenders and wants to distribute a retirement bonus to pensioners next year, as his leftist predecessor did before losing the elections in July.\n\nHe has also pledged to increase net wages by reducing social security contributions and ease taxation to attract investors.", "description": "Greek private sector workers walked off the job on Wednesday and marched through the streets of Athens to protest against labor reforms planned by the new conservative government which they say will weaken unions and curb their right to strike.", "authors": ["Renee Maltezou", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436148863&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910DU"}
