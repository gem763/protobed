Reuters\n\nMalaysian police have detained 12 people without trial, including two DAP politicians, using a law the PH government promised to abolish.\n\nThe 12 are suspected of promoting, raising money, recruiting people and planning attacks for terrorist group Tamil Tigers.\n\nSome PH leaders, including PM-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim, criticised the law, calling it \u201charsh\u201d and \u201cdraconian\u201d.\n\nPM Mahathir defended police actions on Monday (Oct 14), saying he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with their explanation for the tactic.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has spoken out in defence of police actions amid a hotly-debated arrest of 12 people allegedly linked to terrorist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.\n\nPolice arrested seven suspects on Thursday (Oct 10), including two Democratic Action Party (DAP) politicians from Melaka and Negeri Sembilan, and five more on Monday (Oct 14), under a controversial law that the Pakatan Harapan government previously pledged to abolish.\n\nRead also: Mahathir picked a lawyer as Malaysia\u2019s new anti-corruption chief \u2013 but the Malaysian Bar is strongly objecting\n\nThe Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), which police used, allowed them to detain arrested suspects for 28 days without trial to conduct investigations.\n\nVarious PH leaders, including People\u2019s Justice Party head Anwar Ibrahim, have criticised police use of the SOSMA Act, with the prime minister-in-waiting describing the move as \u201charsh\u201d.\n\nOther notable personalities who spoke out against the use of SOSMA include DAP member Lim Lip Eng, Klang MP Charles Santiago, Syahredzan Johan (political secretary to DAP leader Lim Kit Siang) and political cartoonist Zunar.\n\n\u201cThe police will have to answer to the select committee the need to use Sosma, a repressive and draconian law which the Pakatan Harapan government has pledged to repeal, on the seven who can be detained without trial for up to 28 days,\u201d https://t.co/J512uT8Iym \u2014 LIM LIP ENG (@limlipeng) October 11, 2019\n\n3. SOSMA must go. Pakatan Harapan must keep it\u2019s election promise. Police action against 12 for alleged LTTE links shows SOSMA can be abused. 4. If police have concrete evidence why not charge the 12 in an open court? Why detain them without trial? \u2014 Charles Santiago (@mpklang) October 13, 2019\n\nI have conducted a number of SOSMA trials (available on Google if you're curious). SOSMA skews criminal trials in favour of the prosecution. So much so that I would say, SOSMA does not give the accused a fair trial. \u2014 Syahredzan Johan (@syahredzan) October 14, 2019\n\nSay no to Sosma. Say no to detention without trial. If the person accused of committing any crime, charge him to the court, so he can defend himself.\n\nMore Cartoons buy books @ https://t.co/Ne3fBnioRF pic.twitter.com/egYBazcfrz \u2014 Zunar Cartoonist (@zunarkartunis) October 14, 2019\n\nBut Bernama quoted PM Mahathir as saying on Oct 14 that he found police actions had been reasonable.\n\n\u201cI was briefed by the police, and they gave me the reasons behind their action, and I am satisfied with them,\u201d Bernama quoted him as saying.\n\n\u201cThe SOSMA Act is still there, so in the absence of other laws that can be applied, they used the SOSMA Act,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s Question Time\u201d is now a thing \u2013 and Mahathir says he\u2019s turning up whether there are questions or not\n\nPolice added that terrorism was \u201ca security matter\u201c, and taking suspects\u2019 statements would deny officers the right to search them.\n\nPolice Inspector-General Abdul Hamid Bador added that the arrests were standard operating procedure, and urged political leaders to \u201ccalm down\u201c.\n\nPoliticians gave speeches, raised funds and handed out brochures for terrorist group: Police\n\nHome Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Saturday (Oct 12) that the police had strong evidence against the 12 suspects thanks to a long-running intelligence operation.\n\nAmong the 12 are an insurance agent from Kuala Lumpur, a security supervisor from Penang, a municipal council member from Melaka, a technician from Kedah, a taxi driver from Perak, and a teacher from Selangor, Bernama said in a separate report.\n\nThe suspects carried out financial transactions involving huge sums, believed to be for promoting and recruiting people to the Tamil Tigers, Bernama quoted the police as saying on Sunday (Oct 13).\n\nThey also had flags, posters, and pictures of Tamil Tiger leaders on their mobile phones or at home, and promoted the terrorist group on social media, the report added.\n\nRead also: 7 people linked to terrorist groups have been detained in Singapore and Malaysia \u2013 here\u2019s what we know about them\n\nPolice added that they detected Tamil Tiger branches in every Malaysian state, with two of the 12 suspects planning to launch \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks.\n\nThe two DAP members gave speeches at a Tamil Tiger event last November, and raised funds and distributed brochures for the terrorist group, Bernama quoted police as saying.\n\nBut Finance Minister and DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said on Oct 10 that the party believed the members innocent, Bernama said in a separate report.\n\n\u201cTheir involvement in the DAP so far has shown no indication that the two were involved in any (terrorist) activities,\u201d Bernama quoted Lim as saying.\n\nHe added: \u201cDAP hopes that (the) truth shall not only be made known and prevail, but also set them free.\u201d\n\nRead also: If Prime Minister Dr Mahathir has his way, corrupt government officials would be shot \u2018like in China\u2019\n\nPM Mahathir on Oct 13 rejected claims that the arrests had been orchestrated ahead of the upcoming General Election, Bernama said in a separate report.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to use power to weaken any quarter,\u201d Bernama quoted Mahathir as saying. \u201c\u2018It is not me who nabbed these people\u2026 it is the police who did so, and the arrests by their officers were following the law.\u201d\n\nHe added that the PH administration would have to conduct background checks on those detained to identify possible political implications.\n\nRead also: Jho Low will get a fair trial because Malaysian courts are not influenced by the government, Mahathir says", "description": "Business Insider - \u201cI was briefed by the police, and they gave me the reasons behind their action, and I am satisfied with them,\u201d Bernama quoted him as saying..
