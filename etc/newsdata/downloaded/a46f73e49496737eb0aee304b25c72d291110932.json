However, we reject the ways in which LGBT+ issues are being deployed in the government\u2019s discourse about the requirement to teach \u201cFundamental British Values\u201d as part of their \u201cPrevent\u201d counter-extremism and counter-terrorism strategies.\n\nThe government\u2019s claim that teaching LGBT+-inclusive RSE constitutes the promotion of \u201cFundamental British Values\u201d is highly hypocritical. Let us not forget that it was Britain that implemented anti-sodomy laws across its empire, and it is Britain that continues to deport LGBT+ people seeking asylum from those very laws. It is worth remembering that the 21 MPs who voted against the new LGBT+-inclusive guidance on compulsory RSE earlier this year were predominantly white British men from the Conservative party and the DUP. Our (unelected) prime minister Boris Johnson has a history of making homophobic remarks, including attacking Labour for encouraging the teaching of homosexuality in schools and describing gay men as \u201cbumboys.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It was described in a PowerPoint presented by headteacher Hazel Pulley as part of the school\u2019s strategy to \u201creduce radicalisation\u201d.\n\nThe way that \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d has been implemented and the wider embrace of LGBT+-inclusive RSE as the poster-child for the implementation of \u201cFundamental British Values\u201d suggests a colonial \u201ccivilising\u201d attitude towards Muslim communities, and contributes to a harmful and inaccurate stereotype of an uncivilised and intolerant Muslim culture.\n\nPrevent is widely acknowledged to place excessive scrutiny and surveillance on Muslim children. The strategy has been widely denounced by human and civil rights organisations, with Rights Watch referring to it as \u201cthe systematic breach of children\u2019s human rights in the school setting\u201d.\n\nHomophobia exists in Muslim communities \u2013 as it does in every community. Yet the spotlight on Muslim communities and the moral panic that has ensued demonstrates that Muslims are an easy target for accusations of homophobia which can be used to demonise entire communities. Mainstream media coverage of the events in Birmingham has encouraged the spectacle of the protests, inaccurately singled out one specific community as universally homophobic, and excluded more critical LGBT+ voices. As LGBT+ people, we condemn the cynical use of our identities as a form of dog-whistle racism, which is being mobilised to justify harmful policies of state surveillance and the criminalisation of Muslim communities.\n\nMore than ever, young people of all faiths and none need safe spaces to discuss and learn about consent, healthy relationships, gender, sexuality and identity. As LGBT+ people, we must resist efforts to co-opt these urgent issues. We must connect our struggles against homophobia, biphobia and transphobia to the fight against racism.\n\nOur demands:\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) must offer clear guidance for the delivery of LGBT+ inclusive education in schools serving all our communities, produced in dialogue with LGBT+ groups, and including LGBT+ faith organisations.\n\nDfE guidance must stress that schools should teach LGBT+-inclusive RSE as part of the usual RSE curriculum and not as specific to the promotion of \u201cFundamental British Values.\u201d\n\nThere cannot be honest and trusting relationships between schools and communities while the Prevent policy is in place \u2013 we recommend that Prevent is abolished immediately.\n\nInclusive Mosque Initiative\n\nMaslaha\n\nPurple Rain Collective\n\nPride of Arabia\n\nFemmes of Colour\n\nLevel Up\n\nMadaniya Sudan Diaspora Global\n\nDevil\u2019s Dyke Network\n\nEast End Sisters Uncut\n\nDr Sita Balani, King\u2019s College London\n\nProfessor Judith Butler, University of California Berkeley\n\nDesiree Akhavan (director, producer, screenwriter, actress)\n\nNazmia Jamal (teacher)\n\nFrankie Muggleton (teacher)\n\nNeil Hart (teacher)\n\nMalak Obaidi (teacher)\n\nKiren Mirza (teacher)\n\nJay Bernard (writer)\n\nDr Humaira Saeed\n\nDr Nadine El-Enany, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nDr Sarah Keenan, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nDr Rahul Rao, SOAS University of London\n\nDr Suhraiya Jivraj, Director of the Centre for Sexuality, Race & Gender Justice, Kent Law School, University of Kent\n\nDr Jen Slater, Sheffield Hallam University\n\nProfessor Donatella Alessandrini, SeRGJ, Kent Law School\n\nDr Sinead Ring, SerGJ, Maynooth University Department of Law\n\nSomak Biswas, University of Warwick\n\nSara Bamdad, University of Warwick\n\nAjamu X (artist)\n\nTobi Adebajo (artist)\n\nDr Dzifa Afonu (clinical psychologist)\n\nDr Navtej Purewal, SOAS University of London\n\nDr Deborah Grayson\n\nDr Caoimhe Mader McGuiness, Kingston University\n\nDr Alyosxa Tudor, School of African and Oriental Studies,\n\nSarah Golightley, University of Edinburgh\n\nDr Nat Raha\n\nDr Sam Solomon, University of Sussex\n\nKatharine Terrell, Sheffield Hallam University\n\nDr Tanya Serisier, Birkbeck College, University of London\n\nDr Ba\u015fak Ert\u00fcr, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nDr Eddie Bruce-Jones, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nDr Gail Lewis\n\nDecolonizing Sexualities Network\n\nAnisa De Jong, University of Kent\n\nDr Sandeep Bakhshi, University of Paris Diderot\n\nDr Silvia Posocco, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nZinzi Minott (dancer/artist)\n\nLola Olufemi (writer/activist)\n\nSara Sassanelli, Institute of Contemporary Arts\n\nIfeanyi Awachie, Institute of Contemporary Arts\n\nLen Lukowski (writer)\n\nEmily Nunn (librarian)\n\nDr Ros Murray, King\u2019s College London\n\nOchi Reyes, Westminster University, Adult Learning Lewisham and Brampton College\n\nDr Kyoung Kim, Feminist Review Journal\n\nDr Daniel Luther, SOAS University of London\n\nSyma Tariq, CRiSAP, University of the Arts London\n\nIrene Revell, CRiSAP, University of the Arts London\n\nCeylan Beg\u00fcm Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nTimothy Smith, CRiSAP, University of the Arts London\n\nDr Terese Jonsson\n\nLani Parker, Sideways Times\n\nDr Vanja Hamzi\u0107, SOAS University of London\n\nZia \u00c1lmos Joshua\n\nMumbi Nkonde (community activist)\n\nSanah Ahsan (Trainee Clinical Psychologist, Poet, journalist)\n\nAisha Mirza (writer/ DJ)\n\nSabah Choudrey (youth worker/writer)\n\nSharan Dhaliwal (editor Burnt Roti)\n\nMolly Ackhurst (community organiser/activist)\n\nImani Robinson (artist/curator)\n\nDr Serkan Delice, London College of Fashion\n\nThe UK supports Ugandan refugees\n\nA comment piece was published by The Independent Friday 16 August 2019, written by Dr Mumtaz Kassam, deputy head of mission at the Ugandan Embassy in Rome. It was about international aid funding for refugees in Uganda and wrongly stated that the UK no longer supports refugees in Uganda.\n\nWe are deeply committed to supporting refugees in Uganda and in the last financial year, \u00a335 million of UK aid provided food, water and healthcare to those in desperate need who have fled relentless violence.\n\nIt is incorrect to say the UK no longer supports refugees in Uganda or that we have suspended funding for refugees. Following an audit report in late 2018 about the UN refugee agency UNHCR, which included allegations of corruption, we have not released any further funds to that specific agency for the work they do in Uganda. This does not mean the amount of money we spend on supporting refugees in Uganda has changed as we continue to work with other charities and international partners to help vulnerable refugees in Uganda to survive. This includes the World Food Programme who are providing food for more than 1 million refugees a month.\n\nThis is saving lives, giving refugees hope for the future and building stability in the region which is in all our interests.\n\nAndrew Stephenson\n\nMinster of state for Africa at the Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office\n\nThe student vote\n\nAm I alone in being concerned that any voting date in early October will potentially disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of students as they move between their home addresses and new accommodation in their college towns?\n\nAll political parties have a democratic duty to get students registered for a personal or proxy or postal vote, and the government must ensure that this new cohort can vote without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nJohn P Wieczorek\n\nEarley\n\nLounging around\n\nWhat a wonderful picture of Jacob Rees-Mogg lounging on the front bench during a debate. It sums him up exactly. Perhaps he might like to ask Melania Trump for her jacket with the slogan: \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do u?\"\n\nB Sheldon\n\nAddress supplied\n\nRegarding Jacob Rees-Mogg taking a nap on the frontbench. In fairness, people have been falling asleep on those green seats, and the red ones down the hall, for years.\n\nEve Parnell\n\nDublin\n\nWhere\u2019s the evidence?\n\nJeremy Corbyn must see evidence of negotiations with the EU and proposals for solving the Irish border problem before agreeing to a general election. Boris Johnson's assertion that they exist cannot be trusted.\n\nSarah Pegg\n\nSeaford\n\nTax havens\n\nCaptain Kevin Slade (Letters, 3 September) called for a ship to be on permanent station in the Caribbean to assist in emergency situations such as that which has befallen the Bahamas. The UK should certainly offer help and aid to countries in such peril especially ex-colonies, however, might I suggest a tax on the billions of pounds of money passing through these islands, whether legally or not, which can then be used to finance such assistance?\n\nG Forward\n\nStirling", "description": "As LGBT+ individuals, and organisations that support LGBT+ communities, we are concerned by the way that Muslim communities have been framed by both government and media in relation to the teaching of LGBT+-inclusive Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in primary schools.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/21/12/birmingham-lgbt-school-protest-2-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
