Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who has vocally clashed with the president.\n\nComparing Cummings to the prophet Elijah, Clinton said to loud applause that \u201clike that Old Testament prophet, he stood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\"\n\nLongtime top Clinton adviser Philippe Reines also fueled the flames, saying in interviews this week with Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson and Dana Perino that his old boss had not closed the door on a 2020 bid.\n\nHe told Carlson Clinton hasn't closed the door to running, saying she would \"think about it long and hard\" if she thought she had the best odds of beating Trump \u2014 while still calling the scenario unlikely.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it\u2019s not zero. I don\u2019t know how to be more honest than that,\u201d Reines said Thursday on Fox News' \u2018Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.\u2019\n\n\u201cTo the extent that I talk to her about the race and just in general what she\u2019s up to, I do think she\u2019s been looking and watching wistfully, which is totally understandable given the race she went through in 2016,\u201d Reines said.\n\nThe former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state, and the first major-party female presidential nominee, has essentially remained in the spotlight ever since losing the 2016 election to Trump \u2014 yet winning the national popular vote.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE\n\nBut her comments and actions in recent weeks have elevated her relevance in the 2020 campaign to a new level, renewing questions about her role in the race for the White House and sparking some speculation that she still has presidential ambitions despite past claims to the contrary.\n\nThe latest episodes include Clinton tweeting \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me\u201d in response to Trump's suggestion about running in 2020; mocking Trump\u2019s interactions with foreign leaders; and arguing without evidence that Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is a \u201cRussian asset\u201d \u2014 a swipe that injected her into the 2020 primary battle, even from the sidelines.\n\nA top aide downplayed the 2020 speculation, however.\n\n\u201cThe short of it is that she\u2019s on a book tour and is feeling unconstrained about speaking her mind,\u201d longtime Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told Fox News earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to over-ascribe a strategy about every word she utters, but it\u2019s as simple as that. She\u2019s out there telling the truth.\u201d\n\nCLINTON MULLING WHITE HOUSE BID, CITING WEAK FIELD, ACCORDING TO REPORTS\n\nBut the story went viral on Tuesday, with a New York Times report that Clinton in recent weeks stated she would declare her candidacy if she were certain she would win the race.\n\nThe article, headlined \u201cAnxious Democratic Establishment Asks, \u2018Is There Anybody Else?\u2019,\u201d noted that about a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered in New York City raised concerns whether former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 a co-front-runner \u2013 could stand strong against Trump, and worried about his fundraising struggles and the need to defend his son Hunter Biden over business dealings in Ukraine amid the House impeachment inquiry into the president. Those gathered also said Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were likely too liberal to win the general election.\n\nAn adviser close to the Biden world, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, said the former vice president\u2019s camp is not taking the media reports seriously and they continue to \u201cmove ahead.\u201d\n\nAnd in the crucial first primary state of New Hampshire, a top Democrat says concern with the field and a hunger for another candidate is not a topic of conversation that she's heard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing about people wishing someone else would get into the race,\u201d said Kathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and former New Hampshire Democratic party chair.\n\nSullivan, who backed Clinton in the 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, told Fox News, \u201cI\u2019m not taking this seriously. I love Hillary Clinton and I think she\u2019d be a fantastic president but there is a lot of really good people running for president right now. I think it\u2019s too late in the day for someone to get into the race. I don\u2019t take it seriously and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea and we don\u2019t need to have anyone else in the race right now.\u201d\n\nIt is getting late in the game, especially in New Hampshire, where Nov. 15 is the last day for a candidate to file to get their name on the first-in-the-nation presidential primary ballot.\n\nAnd a longtime Democratic veteran of over 10 New Hampshire primaries noted that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen this before. It\u2019s not an uncommon Democratic trait to long for someone who is not in the race. It\u2019s like pre-buyer\u2019s remorse. Shopper's remorse.\u201d\n\nFox News' Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.", "description": "It\u2019s been the talk of the 2020 campaign trail this week.
