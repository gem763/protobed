Rather than acquiesce to these left-wing protesters' demands, one In-N-Out employee simply picked up a grown man who was leading the demonstration and carried him out of the joint before calling police who promptly took over the situation.\n\nAs you can see in the following video, an In-N-Out employee named Tim, in his uniform replete with the classic company hat and red apron, simply manhandled the lefty and hauled him off the premises.\n\nClimate change activists raid a burger joint and harass the workers. Neither the employees nor police are having it. People are fed up with Extinction Rebellion. pic.twitter.com/6bIPK4pb9U \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) October 18, 2019\n\nTim repeatedly told the gray-haired, bearded moonbat to get off his property. The lefty refused, and Tim called the cops. Then, perhaps unaware of the irony, the video cut to another protester complaining that her property, the blow horn she used to berate and harass families enjoying a nice meal and employees earning a living, was thrown in the trash. That girl ended up being handcuffed, but it is unclear if any charges were filed.\n\nBased on available evidence, it seems the situation died down. Good for these workers for putting the kibosh on these kooky climate eco-warriors in the proper manner. As Townhall covered last week, commuters in England weren't as friendly to members of Extinction Rebellion who blocked a subway train from leaving the station. London workers pummeled the crap out of some bloke who delayed their start of the work day.", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:24:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/85/d31327c4-9bc0-4b28-afc3-27fb6267965b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
