Former coach Gwen Stefani is set to replace him. USA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert: This story contains details about Monday's episode of \"The Voice.\"\n\nAmerica's favorite couple is fighting again.\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani found themselves going head-to-head over several singers during Monday's episode of \"The Voice,\" much to the enjoyment of fellow coaches John Legend and Kelly Clarkson.\n\n\"I never expected my own girlfriend to go for my throat as much as she is,\" Shelton said. Stefani added, \"I probably am going to beat him, so I feel fired up.\"\n\nThe couple both turned around for Brennen Henson following his playful rendition of Vance Joy's \"Riptide.\" Stefani taunted, \"You want to fight, Blakey?\"\n\nLast week on 'The Voice': Kelly Clarkson gets sweet revenge on Blake Shelton with epic block\n\n\"You're so cute. \u2026 I think we could have a lot of fun together if you were on Team Gwen,\" the No Doubt rocker added to Henson. Shelton interjected, \"Whoa, Whoa!\"\n\nHe said \"I\u2019m in a tough spot here. If I get you on my team then she\u2019s gonna be (mad) at me and I\u2019m going to pay for that later on.\"\n\nHenson went with Stefani. \"It just feels really good because I bet Blake. It\u2019s awesome,\" the newest coach gloated. Shelton told Stefani and Clarkson to \"kiss my (expletive).\"\n\n\"I love when Mom and Dad fight. It\u2019s fun,\" Clarkson added.\n\nLegend used their beef to his advantage during the next Blind Audition. \"I don\u2019t want you to be a rift in between America\u2019s favorite couple. I think the best solution is to pick someone who\u2019s a neutral party. This way their relationship stays intact,\" he told Jared Herzog following his performance of Dan + Shay's \"Speechless.\" (Shelton and Stefani both turned.)\n\nIt worked. Herzog went with Legend after the \"All of Me\" singer bribed him with a dinner cooked by his wife, Chrissy Teigen.\n\n\"John started using our relationship against us. John was playing a little dirty on that one,\" Stefani said.\n\nHey @chrissyteigen.. looks like we\u2019re having a dinner guest! What should we make?? Excellent choice, Jared! #VoiceBlinds \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) October 8, 2019\n\nBribery also helped Shelton land his first four-chair turn of the season. Ricky Duran wowed all of the judges with his emotional rendition of Leon Bridges' \"River.\"\n\n\"In my place in Oklahoma, I have a river. I would love to take you to it. If you want to go,\" Shelton said, mimicking the song's lyrics. Duran surprisingly responded, \"I think I want to go to that river. I pick Blake.\"\n\n\"Nobody is more surprised than I am that Ricky chose me as his coach,\" Shelton said.\n\nStefani showed her main man some love. \"I\u2019m happy for Blake,\" she said.\n\nClarkson had one question. \"Blake got a rock goddess to date him. I\u2019m still wondering how that happened,\" she quipped.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/07/the-voice-blake-shelton-girlfriend-gwen-stefani-fighting-again/3904174002/", "description": "\"I never expected my own girlfriend to go for my throat as much as she is,\" Blake Shelton said about fellow coach Gwen Stefani.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
