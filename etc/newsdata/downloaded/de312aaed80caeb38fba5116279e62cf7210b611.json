Stoddard.\n\nMany Republican lawmakers have been wrongfully silent and have even defended Trump in these actions, Stoddard claimed Thursday on \"Special Report.\"\n\n\"The president was facing impeachment because of his phone call with the Ukrainian president -- the transcript of which the administration released, where without a quid pro quo or any kind of question of extortion, he was asking for the help of a foreign government in his election,\" she said.\n\nGRAHAM CALLS OUT NY TIMES REPORT SAYING TRUMP 'PRESSED' AUSSIE PM\n\n\"Today, he asked for the help of others -- there's been reporting he's asked for help from Australia and Britain -- and now he's asking the Chinese and admitting it out in the open. He is not allowed to do that.\"\n\nStoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, said the situation is the latest example of Trump putting lawmakers from his own party in a troubling spot.\n\nShe claimed unless there is an outcry within Republican ranks against what Trump has asked of Beijing and Kiev, his presidential successor will be able to play by the new set of rules he purportedly created.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIn addition, she suggested Sen.
