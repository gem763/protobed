But we will WIN!\"\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nThis tweet from the president came amid a series of tweets apparently quoting programming on \"Fox & Friends,\" which included accounts about polling on impeachment and about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile he has previously referred to both the impeachment inquiry and Mueller probe as a \u201ccoup,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s comments appear to be the first time Trump has publicly used the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe the investigations into his potential misconduct in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies, however, have used variations of the the word in such a context.\n\nIn September, Sen. Ted Cruz referred to Democratic outcry about Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky -- which sparked the impeachment inquiry -- as a \u201clynch mob.\u201d\n\nAt least they\u2019re honest: Don\u2019t let \u201cfacts\u201d or \u201cevidence\u201d stand in the way of our lynch mob.... https://t.co/o01uk1yooM \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 25, 2019\n\nReaction to the president\u2019s tweet was swift.\n\nA top Democrat, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., said on CNN, \u201c\"That is one word no president ought to apply to himself. You know, I've studied presidential history quite a bit, and I don't know if we've ever seen anything quite like this.\"\n\nRep. Bobby Rush of Illinois, an African American Democratic congressman, in a reference to the historical connotations of the word, said, \u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Rush tweeted.\n\nYou think this impeachment is a LYNCHING? What the hell is wrong with you?\n\n\n\nDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet. https://t.co/oTMhWo4awR \u2014 Bobby L. Rush (@RepBobbyRush) October 22, 2019\n\nOn the campaign trail, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary and 2020 presidential candidate Julian Castro said the president\u2019s use of the word was \u201cbeyond shameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond shameful to use the word \u2018lynching\u2019 to describe being held accountable for your actions,\u201d Castro tweeted.\n\nGeorge Conway, lawyer and husband to White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and a frequent Trump critic, called him \u201cderanged.\u201d\n\nThe president's reference to \"lynching\" comes months after the Senate passed a bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime. The bill was introduced by Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker -- both now presidential hopefuls -- and Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nThe Justice for Victims of Lynching Act referred to lynching as having \"succeeded slavery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction.\"\n\n\"Lynching is not a relic of a painful past -- it is a present and pernicious evil that we still have yet to confront,\" Booker said in a statement in February.\n\nThis is a developing story.
