For days, some allies of the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had agitated on Twitter for Mr. Graham to do more to try to counteract Democrats in the House.\n\nOne line of pressure has been for Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, to call witnesses in that chamber as a sort of counterprogramming, though on Thursday he said that made no sense to him.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Nothing and everything changed on impeachment\n\nBut Graham is not the problem; he\u2019s signaled a willingness to stand by Trump through thick, thin, and horrific lynching analogies. The White House\u2019s challenge is other senators. Some Republicans have been notably open to an impeachment inquiry, but most have been conspicuously quiet. Some use the time-honored excuse that they\u2019d serve as jurors in a trial and therefore ought not to weigh in; many more are simply dodging questions. What they\u2019re mostly not doing is mounting substantive defenses of the president\u2019s behavior. A Daily Caller canvass found only seven of the 53 Republicans were willing to rule out voting to remove Trump.\n\nRepublican senators have always been less tractable for Trump than representatives, though the GOP controls the Senate but not the House. The president has many rah-rah fans in the House, and House members are also more vulnerable to pressure from Trump-loving constituents if they get out of line with the White House. (Francis Rooney of Florida, the most outspoken Trump critic on the Ukraine matter in recent weeks, has announced he\u2019s retiring.) Senators are more insulated from immediate political pressure, more rooted in Washington and the party structure, and less fond of the president.\n\nNonetheless, it would take a major change in the evidence against Trump, or a vast shift in polling, for enough Republican senators to support conviction that the president would be in serious danger of removal in a Senate trial. Yet it\u2019s clear that Trump does care a great deal about senators\u2019 positions. The impetus for his hasty cancellation of plans to host the Group of Seven summit at this resort in Doral, Florida, was apparently the anger it provoked among Republican senators. In the past, Trump has been content to weather their displeasure, but this time he folded.\n\nDavid A. Graham: \u2018Get over it\u2019 is the Trump Doctrine\n\nPerhaps Trump believes that a unified GOP Senate response will persuade Democrats not to vote to impeach; I am skeptical that will work. Or perhaps Trump worries about the political damage if a majority of the Senate voted to convict, even if it didn\u2019t lead to removal. It would take only four GOP defections to reach a majority for conviction in the Senate.", "description": "A resolution meant to be a show of solidarity by Republicans with the president has instead become a sign of weakness.", "authors": ["David A.
