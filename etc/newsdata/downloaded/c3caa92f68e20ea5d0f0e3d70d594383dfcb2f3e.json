Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nWe know what the barriers are. We have a highly reductionist electoral, political, and media network in the UK which manufactures extreme divisions, builds counterfeit walls, and assumes a single vote to be representative of a wide array of emotional, psychological, and social positions. Such a system demands politicians who are sensitive, who listen, and who tread carefully. Politicians, that is, who do not self-identify as the Hulk.\n\nBut there is a silver lining to the havoc that\u2019s been unleashed over the last three years. Those opposed to a no-deal Brexit have shown that there are ways of working together despite our arcane, adversarial and divisive system. When pushed to the brink, a large number of MPs have been willing to put country before party. They have defied the orders of their whips and leaders. They have bridged old divides \u2013 some have literally crossed the floor of the Commons \u2013 in order to work together to achieve shared goals and protect agreed principles.\n\nConversations and ways of working together are emerging that the UK has never seen in peacetime. Like a muscle that gains strength through training, this needs to be captured, repeated, and practiced.\n\nIf politicians can find compromise and common cause with their one-time enemies to try to see off a no-deal Brexit then they can do it to tackle other issues that pose a threat to us all. They can do it to alleviate suffering and tackle climate change.\n\nWhen politicians are able to set aside their party loyalties and personal ambition all manner of solutions become possible. And these collaborative, non-partisan ways of working can and must continue whatever happens with Brexit. That is the ambition that Compassion in Politics and our network of more than 50 parliamentarians from six parties have set ourselves and with traditional ways of working beginning to fracture, we are optimistic that we can change politics for good.\n\nOf course getting to this point will require political parties to break out of old habits and expend far greater energy on tackling serious issues than on scoring points at their rivals\u2019 expense. Any politician willing to do so should see immediate benefits.\n\nIn polling carried out by Opinium for Compassion in Politics and released today we found that over half of voters (51 per cent) would like to see MPs put the principle of compassion before the interests of their own party. Some 42 per cent like it when MPs work with colleagues in other parties (19 per cent neither support nor oppose, 10 per cent are unsure, and 29 per cent oppose). There is fertile ground where a new political culture can put down roots, grow, and flourish.\n\nWe can plant those seeds now, too. Assuming that an election does take place in the coming months we would like every party to commit to a code of conduct which at its least would ban hate and personal attacks, reject name-calling, labels, and stereotypes and prioritise giving a voice to the under-represented. But even if it doesn\u2019t, we hope individual politicians will continue to coalesce around shared values rather than party lines.\n\nIn so doing they would ensure that whatever happens with Brexit, politics builds, supports, and strengthens communities rather than destabilising, dividing, and undermining them.\n\nOur country desperately needs a new political phoenix to fly from the ashes of the destruction wreaked upon it in the last few years \u2013 and it needs it now.\n\nJennifer Nadel is a co-founder of campaign group Compassion in Politics.
