But this weekend, the paper scooped all the nation\u2019s major news outlets with a story confirming that the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine had resigned following accusations that he had collaborated with President Donald Trump and to put pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rivals.\n\nKurt Volker resigned to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday after he was accused of connecting Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Ukrainian officials to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe reporter who broke the State Press story, Andrew Howard, a 20-year-old junior from Phoenix, Ariz., tells TIME that he had learned the envoy had resigned from an unnamed university official. Howard says that it had occurred to him that other media outlets might not realize that Volker was also the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at the university. He admits that they\u2019d only hoped to connect the story to the university, and didn\u2019t expect that they\u2019d get such a big scoop.\n\n\u201cIt was just trying to find a way as a small, local community, student-run paper to basically get this story that everyone is reading and everyone knows about to a local level. And that just led us down almost like a rabbit hole to this scoop. Which was crazy, to be honest with you,\u201d Howard says, noting that he\u2019s been taking interviews from news outlets all weekend. \u201cWe published the story, and 20 minutes later they were talking about the story on CNN.\u201d\n\nHoward, a managing editor at the student paper, says that he was actually working on obituaries at his community reporting internship for the Arizona Republic when the story was published.\n\n\u201cThey were talking about it in the newsroom, and I just sort of awkwardly gestured\u2014 that was me! My bad,\u201d says Howard.\n\nHoward stresses that publishing the story was a team effort, and that he worked with the State Press\u2019s editor in chief and another managing editor to confirm the story and make sure that it was ready to be published. The university paper is independently run by students, which Howard says makes it a great training ground for young reporters.\n\nAlthough he admits he\u2019s still processing all the attention he\u2019s gotten since the story broke, Howard says that he hopes to pursue a career in journalism because he believes in the field\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to serve the people that are in the community that you live in, for people to be well-informed and know what\u2019s happening. I couldn\u2019t imagine what the world would be like without that,\u201d said Howard.\n\nWrite to Tara Law at tara.law@time.com.", "description": "An Arizona State University student reporter scooped national news outlets on the resignation of Kurt Volker as the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine", "authors": ["Tara Law"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/kurt-volker-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
