Deep in winter, months from the first thaw, this part of the year presents the greatest dearth of healthy, fresh veggies. This time of year, we\u2019re even starting to run short on some\n\nsquashes . Not to mention, there are only so many squash dishes you can eat before you need a change of pace. Enter the small, yet mighty, Brussels sprout. Brussels sprouts are one of the healthiest cool-weather vegetables around. In fact, forget about cool weather. Brussels sprouts are one of the healthiest veggies, period. They haven\u2019t been around that long. Developed from the same ancestor plant as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower, early Brussels sprouts can be traced back to Roman times. However, their current iteration didn\u2019t come about until the 1200s in Belgium, and didn\u2019t find widespread adoption until the late 16century. They finally made it over to the US in the 1800s. Compared with a lot of our other veggies, Brussels sprouts are still babies. That\u2019s part of the reason why they\u2019re changing so rapidly. Until the 1960s, almost every variety of Brussels sprout was bitter. There was a good reason that Brussels sprouts got a bad rap. Today\u2019s Brussels sprout isn\u2019t the same at all. In fact, some varieties are downright sweet. So if you grew up hating Brussels sprouts, you might want to give them another shot. Not just because they taste better now. But also because Brussels sprouts are one of the healthiest foods in the universe.\n\nThe amazing Brussels sprout\n\nYour secret weapon in the fight against cancer\n\n100 grams of Brussels sprouts (6 to 10 sprouts, depending on their size)\u2014the serving size I\u2019ll use throughout this article\u2014contain about 85 mg of vitamin C. That\u2019s 142% of your recommended daily allowance (RDA), and approaching twice as much vitamin C as you\u2019ll find in an orange. Vitamin C, as you know, is a phenomenal benefit to your health. It does everything from improving your immune system , to slowing the aging of your skin, to reducing your risk of stroke. But vitamin C is just one of the nutrients Brussels sprouts can deliver in spades. Brussels sprouts also give you 25% of your RDA of vitamin A (bone growth and health, vision, cell growth), good doses of minerals like iron (17.5%) and manganese (15%), and 147% of your RDA of vitamin K (heart health, bone health, and cancer-fighting properties).Vitamin K is only one nutrient that Brussels sprouts offer to fight cancer . In addition, these little powerhouses also contain a whole host of anti-oxidants, which help to prevent free radicals from damaging your genes. Specifically, Brussels sprouts are rich in glucosinolates and isothiocyanates\u2014two types of antioxidants that have proven especially effective against colon, prostate, and endometrial cancers. Not to mention, like all leafy greens, Brussels sprouts are rich in folic acid\u2014the version of vitamin B that\u2019s both helpful in maintaining the integrity of your DNA, and in maintaining your heart health. These are just the highlights. Frankly, Brussels sprouts contain so many essential vitamins and nutrients, simply listing them all would fill too many pages. And yet, despite all these health effects, Brussels sprouts are very low-calorie (only 43 calories per 100 grams!), contain no cholesterol, yet deliver a surprisingly potent punch of protein. So as this winter drags on, remember the lowly Brussels sprout. If you\u2019ve been avoiding them for years, you may be pleasantly surprised how good they taste now. Steam them to avoid losing any nutrients\u2014although, even saut\u00e9ed or fried, they\u2019ll probably be the healthiest thing on our plate. As a potent delivery system to promote heart health, fight cancer, and give your immune system a boost, it\u2019s hard to find anything that matches up against the Brussels sprout.\n\nReferences", "description": "Unless you\u2019re living in the south, these are the hardest .09/02/2019 3:07:48AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
