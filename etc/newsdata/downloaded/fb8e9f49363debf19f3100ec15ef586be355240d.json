It is fault it did not,\" the report explained.\n\nThe Council accepted it delayed issuing an EHCP. It also accepted there was no evidence of schools having been consulted despite an officer stating they would be.\n\nThe fact that the girl's mum had to chase up the ECHP meant the LGO found the council to be at fault.\n\n\"Whether the girl was out of school due to a medical condition or not, the council had a duty to ensure she was able to benefit from education where it had the responsibility to do so. I have criticised it for not doing so,\" the investigator said.\n\nThe council told the LGO it would expect calls to the service to be responded to and would not expect its staff to ignore emails or fail to permit phone contact. The investigator also upheld this part of the complaint.\n\nThe LGO investigator concluded that the council was at fault for failing to offer or identify appropriate education for the child.\n\nTheir report recommended that the council makes a payment of \u00a31,000 for missed education between March and June 2017 and a further payment of \u00a33,250 for missed education between September 2018 and May 2019 to the girl\u2019s school so that it can identify what support she needs to catch up on.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe investigator also suggested the council pay \u00a3600 to the girl\u2019s mum - \u00a3300 for time and trouble and \u00a3300 for distress.\n\nThe LGO said the council should now \"amend its procedures so it keeps within statutory timescales for issuing EHCPs. It should inform me what changes it has made and how the issues affecting the EHCP in this case will be prevented in future for others.\"\n\nA Leicestershire County Council spokesperson said: \u201cWe take complaints to the council or Ombudsman very seriously and regret that in this case that we did not identify appropriate education for the complainant\u2019s child or issue an Education Health and Care Plan within the timescales.\n\n\"We have acted on the recommendation of the Ombudsman and have taken steps to ensure similar incidents do not arise.\"", "description": "The child's mum complained that the\u00a0council\u00a0failed to accept her daughter was not at\u00a0school\u00a0due to a medical condition - which resulted in her being wrongly referred to the children's missing education team", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Amy Orton", "Image", "Leicester Mercury", "Photothek Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567375.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_School-children-walking-away.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
