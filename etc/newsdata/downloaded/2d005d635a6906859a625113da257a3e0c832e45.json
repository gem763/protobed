Iran\u2019s hard-line Revolutionary Guard Corps in the past has supplied the Houthis with weaponry including drones.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that the Houthis also possess a surprisingly sophisticated arsenal of homemade ballistic and cruise missiles possessing the range performance to strike targets deep inside Saudi Arabia.\n\nAccording to aviation expert Tom Cooper, the main weapon in the Houthi arsenal is the Burkan, a modified version of the Soviet R-17E Scud rocket that\u2019s around five feet longer than the baseline missile and some 4,400 pounds heavier and can travel farther than 500 miles.\n\nThe Houthis inherited from the defunct Yemeni military a large number of Soviet-exported Scuds as well as North Korean-made Scuds called \u201cHwasong-6s.\u201d\n\nIraq in the 1980s modified its own Scuds to the long-range \u201cAl Hussein\u201d standard, which is similar to the Burkan. An Iraqi engineer told Cooper about the modification effort, perhaps offering a perspective on the origins of the Houthis\u2019 long-range rocket force.\n\n\u201cThe R-17E is quite simple,\u201d the engineer told Cooper. \u201cFrom its tip towards the rear, it contains a warhead, then a room for equipment like gyro and timer, then the fuel tank which is about 1.35 meters long, and the oxidizer tank that is about 2.7 meters long. At the rear end is the engine.\u201d\n\nStretching the missile body is no problem, but stretching fuel tanks is one. The simplest solution \u2014 the one we applied early on \u2014 is to take a tank from another missile, cut its central section and insert it into the tank of the modified missile.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Know this: The Houthis inherited from the defunct Yemeni military a large number of Soviet-exported Scuds as well as North Korean-made Scuds called \u201cHwasong-6s.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jHR_V3EwgTot6lDYcLDsdQ--~B/aD05Mzg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/8cabe83a7e681466efd32e68b06ea4b3", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
