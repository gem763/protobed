Also a member of the AFL-CIO Executive Council, Cox has received awards honoring his civil rights and labor activities.\n\nAD\n\nCurrently, however, he\u2019s playing defense on the sidelines, having taken a leave of absence following a Bloomberg Businessweek report that 10 people experienced or witnessed inappropriate conduct by Cox. Most of the 10 were not quoted or named in the article, but the words of Brett Copeland, a former AFGE communications staffer, were alarming.\n\nAD\n\nCopeland told Bloomberg Businessweek that Cox, after repeatedly saying he loved his employee and inviting him to see the Jacuzzi in Cox\u2019s hotel room, licked Copeland\u2019s ear. They were on a business trip to Palm Springs, Calif., in 2017, Copeland said.\n\n\u201cIt was embarrassing, and it was disgusting, and it was kind of unbelievable that it happened,\u201d Copeland told Bloomberg Businessweek. He resigned when he returned to Washington and could not be reached for comment for this article.\n\nAD\n\nAn AFGE statement said it will launch a \u201cfair, impartial, free of bias\u201d investigation by an outside firm into the allegations.\n\nCox, 68, said he is \u201ctruly sorry if I ever made anyone feel uncomfortable by my words or actions,\u201d in a statement released by AFGE. \u201cThat was never my intention.\u201d\n\nHe did not deny or address specific allegations, but he did say: \u201cI cannot abide lies and scurrilous, politically-motivated attacks. I am a lifelong defender of due process and trust the investigation will sort the fact from fiction.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere is no indication of how long the investigation will take or how long Cox will be on leave.\n\nHe decided to \u201cstep away\u201d now, he said, because when \u201cgovernment employees are under daily attack, it is imperative that their union not be distracted from the task at hand.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe distraction has already happened.\n\nIn current and coming contract negotiations with various agencies, local AFGE leaders are trying to navigate \u2014 now without Cox\u2019s leadership but with his controversy \u2014 the reality defined by three executive orders that President Trump issued last year.\n\nThe directives are designed to undermine the power and influence of federal unions. After an initial victory by AFGE and other unions that fought the orders in federal court, an appellate decision recently allowed the directives to take effect.\n\nAD\n\nThey could significantly shift power away from union members by, among other things, diluting grievance procedures, hastening employee terminations and sharply cutting \u201cofficial time.\u201d It allows labor leaders to represent employees in limited and defined ways while being paid by the government.\n\nAD\n\nTrump argued the orders were needed to help develop \u201cefficient, effective, and cost-reducing collective bargaining agreements.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration also has asked the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which is dominated by his appointees and manages federal union-management disputes, if the Janus v. AFSCME Supreme Court decision restricting state and local public sector union dues collection can apply to federal labor organizations.\n\nFederal unions, whose members join and pay dues voluntarily, were not part of the Janus case. Yet, the conservative National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation is urging the Federal Labor Relations Authority to stop agency paycheck deduction of federal union dues unless members \u201cknowingly waived their First Amendment right not to subsidize union activities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNumerous union officials and members would not speak on the record about allegations against Cox or the effect the charges could have on the union, either internally or in its fight with the Trump administration.\n\nNonetheless, the allegations are at least a temporary diversion. So far, there is no indication Cox will resign, but the allegations against him are upsetting to his allies, including Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who represents many federal employees and who chairs the House Government Operations subcommittee.\n\n\u201cThese reports are very troubling and must be investigated,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cHowever, we cannot be distracted from defending the important work our federal workers do every day from the Trump administration\u2019s shameless and baseless attacks.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "J.
