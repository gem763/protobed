(Robert Galbraith/Reuters)\n\nA distant generation created; we mostly delay, idle, and gripe.\n\nMany of the stories about the gods and heroes of Greek mythology were compiled during Greek Dark Ages. Impoverished tribes passed down oral traditions that originated after the fall of the lost palatial civilizations of the Mycenaean Greeks.\n\nDark Age Greeks tried to make sense of the massive ruins of their forgotten forbearers\u2019 monumental palaces that were still standing around. As illiterates, they were curious about occasional clay tablets they plowed up in their fields with incomprehensible ancient Linear B inscriptions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe of the 21st century are beginning to look back at our own lost epic times and wonder about these now-nameless giants who left behind monuments that we cannot replicate, but instead merely use or even mock.\n\nDoes anyone believe that contemporary Americans could build another transcontinental railroad in six years?\n\nCalifornians tried to build a high-speed rail line. But after more than a decade of government incompetence, lawsuits, cost overruns, and constant bureaucratic squabbling, they have all but given up. The result is a half-built overpass over the skyline of Fresno \u2014 and not yet a foot of track laid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho were those giants of the 1960s responsible for building our interstate highway system?\n\nCalifornia\u2019s roads now are mostly the same as we inherited them, although the state population has tripled. We have added little to our freeway network, either because we forgot how to build good roads or would prefer to spend the money on redistributive entitlements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen California had to replace a quarter section of the earthquake-damaged San Francisco Bay Bridge, it turned into a near-disaster, with eleven years of acrimony, fighting, cost overruns \u2014 and a commentary on our decline into Dark Ages primitivism. Yet 82 years ago, our ancestors built four times the length of our singe replacement span in less than four years. It took them just two years to design the entire Bay Bridge and award the contracts.\n\nOur generation required five years just to plan to replace a single section. In inflation-adjusted dollars, we spent six times the money on one quarter of the length of the bridge and required 13 agencies to grant approval. In 1936, just one agency oversaw the entire bridge project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia has not built a major dam in 40 years. Instead, officials squabble over the water stored and distributed by our ancestors, who designed the California State Water Project and Central Valley Project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContemporary Californians would have little food or water without these massive transfers, and yet they often ignore or damn the generation that built the very system that saves us.\n\nAmerica went to the moon in 1969 with supposedly primitive computers and backward engineering. Does anyone believe we could launch a similar moonshot today? No American has set foot on the moon in the last 47 years, and it may not happen in the next 50 years.\n\nHollywood once gave us blockbuster epics, brilliant Westerns, great film noirs, and classic comedies. Now it endlessly turns out comic-book superhero films or pathetic remakes of prior classics.\n\nOur writers, directors, and actors have lost the skills of their ancestors. But they are also cowardly, and in regimented fashion they simply parrot boring race, class, and gender bromides that are neither interesting nor funny. Does anyone believe that the Oscar ceremonies are more engaging and dignified than in the past?\n\nWe have been fighting in Afghanistan without result for 18 years. Our forefathers helped to win World War II and defeat the Axis Powers in four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of learning, does anyone believe that a college graduate in 2020 will know half the information of a 1950 graduate?\n\nIn the 1940s, young people read William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pearl Buck, and John Steinbeck. Are our current novelists turning out anything comparable? Could today\u2019s high-school graduate even finish The Good Earth or The Grapes of Wrath?\n\nTrue, social media is impressive. The internet gives us instant access to global knowledge. We are a more tolerant society, at least in theory. But Facebook is not the Hoover Dam, and Twitter is not the Panama Canal.\n\nOur ancestors were builders and pioneers and mostly fearless. We are regulators, auditors, bureaucrats, adjudicators, censors, critics, plaintiffs, defendants, social-media junkies, and thin-skinned scolds. A distant generation created; we mostly delay, idle, and gripe.\n\nAs we walk amid the refuse, needles, and excrement of the sidewalks of our fetid cities; as we sit motionless on our jammed ancient freeways; and as we pout on Twitter and electronically whine in the porticos of our Ivy League campuses, will we ask: \u201cWho were these people who left these strange monuments that we use but can neither emulate nor understand?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn comparison to us, they now seem like gods.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "description": "Our ancestors were builders and pioneers and mostly fearless.
