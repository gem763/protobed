That room alone takes an hour-and-a-half.\n\n\u2018I then go into the living room and that will take me an hour, then do the hallway, kitchen, bathroom and all the cupboards.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot in my cupboards. Finally I do the clocks in the spare room, which takes another hour.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a long job but I don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t want any of my clocks telling the wrong time.\u2019\n\nHis wall is lined with timepieces, making it impossible for him not to be aware of the time (Picture: Paul Jacobs/pictureexclusive.com)\n\nHe has well over 5,000 now and says he will never stop buying them (Picture: Paul Jacobs/pictureexclusive.com)\n\nThe retired van driver started collecting timepieces in 1980 after his boss chucked one in the bin.\n\nThey said it didn\u2019t work, but all it needed was a new battery, Roy explained.\n\nFrom there, he started scouring charity shops and buying as many clocks as he could.\n\nHe added: \u2018It all started from there. It\u2019s taken a long time but I\u2019ve now built up a collection of well over 5,000 clocks.\n\n\u2018Pauline brings home a new pack of batteries every time she goes to the shops just to make sure none of them ever stop.\u2019\n\nHis wife used to spend three days changing all the hands (Picture: Paul Jacobs/pictureexclusive.com)\n\nThe constant ticking doesn\u2019t seem to bother Roy anymore (Picture: Paul Jacobs/pictureexclusive)\n\nThe noise in Roy and Pauline\u2019s bedroom alone is enough to keep most people awake all night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the collector, who believes his collection is worth upwards of \u00a31,500, insists he no longer hears the constant ticking.\n\nHe added: \u2018I don\u2019t take any notice of the noise\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got 30 by the bed and more on the walls in the bedroom, but you just get used to it.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like when all my Westminster chime clocks go off.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got about 25 of those but they\u2019re all adjusted to go off at the same time, so it doesn\u2019t bother us.\u2019\n\nHe has even more in storage at a family member\u2019s house (Picture: Paul Jacobs/pictureexclusive)\n\nAlong with all the timepieces in his flat, Roy also has boxes full tucked away in storage at a family member\u2019s house after the couple\u2019s shed blew down in bad weather.\n\nBut once he has bought a new one, he will get to work and begin hammering clocks to the walls in there too.\n\nRoy said: \u2018I\u2019ll never stop buying clocks. Once I get some storage space sorted out, I can get the others back from my relative.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll put them in the shed and try and get some more on the walls in my flat.\n\n\u2018I will rearrange them so I can squeeze more in.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
