LNER, Grand Central and Hull Trains services will be cancelled or run with extended journey times.\n\nThameslink and Great Northern services will also be affected.\n\nNetwork Rail says: \u201cMajor upgrade work will take place, upgrading and simplifying the track layout around the station for the first time in 40 years.\n\n\u201cTwo new lines will also be added, increasing the number of services that can run to/from the station, as well as allowing for faster train services.\u201d\n\nSoutheast England\n\nThe High Speed One line from London St Pancras to Ashford in Kent and beyond will be closed from the last trains on Christmas Eve, re-opening on Sunday 29 December. Other, slower trains will continue.\n\nOn Greater Anglia, New Year\u2019s Day will be the worst affected.

But our research is clear: passengers want to be kept on the train wherever possible, they want to know before buying a ticket if part of the journey will be by bus, and they want plenty of staff on hand to signpost and to help.\u201d\n\nBetween now and Christmas there will be a number of significant projects causing delays and cancellations, with the East Coast main line disrupted next weekend between Peterborough and Doncaster, and Liverpool Lime Street station closed on 2 and 3 November for a signalling upgrade.", "description": "Millions of rail passengers face disruption to journeys across Britain over Christmas and New Year\u00a0as a result of engineering work.
