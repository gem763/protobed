It still puts out 1080p video, supports motion detection and night vision, and comes in a weather-resistant cylindrical frame that can be mounted indoors or outside. It\u2019ll still work off wired or battery power, too, but it can now run off a solar-powered accessory as well. It has a slightly worse field of view than the previous battery-powered Stick Up Cam, but it\u2019s much cheaper at $99.99 compared to the previous version\u2019s $179.99. It\u2019s available to pre-order today, with a full release on October 23.\n\nThe Ring Indoor Cam, meanwhile, is essentially a tiny version of the Stick Up Cam that only works when wired to a power outlet. It measures 46mm\u00d746mm\u00d775mm, compared to the new Stick Up Cam\u2019s 60mm\u00d760mm\u00d797mm. It also has a slightly wider field of view: 115 degrees horizontal and 60 degrees vertical versus 110 degrees horizontal and 57 degrees vertical on the Stick Up Cam. Otherwise, it supports 1080p video, motion detection, two-way talk, and night vision just like the larger model. It costs $59.99\u2014undercutting the price of Amazon\u2019s first-party indoor security camera, the Cloud Cam, among others\u2014and is available to purchase today.\n\nBeyond that, Amazon announced the Ring Retrofit Alarm Kit, a \u201cDIY kit\u201d that\u2019s designed to connect to an existing security system hub installed in the home and supply it with the features of a Ring Alarm system. The idea is to get a Ring security setup without having to install new sensors or wiring. Amazon hasn\u2019t provided full details on how this will work but says the device will cost $199.99 on its own or $375.99 bundled with a Ring Alarm Hub. The latter will allow you to control Ring-compatible smart home devices. Amazon says the Retrofit Kit will arrive in November.\n\nAnd now for something completely different\n\nOn the software side of things, Ring\u2019s cameras and video door bells will soon support a new feature called \u201cHome Mode\u201d that Amazon says will prevent Ring products from recording audio and video while you\u2019re home. That will also arrive in November. The company also demoed a feature that will allow the Alexa voice assistant to answer visitors through a Ring doorbell in a \u201cconversational\u201d manner\u2014it could ask a delivery person to leave a package, for instance. Amazon says this will come first to the Ring Video Doorbell Elite (which isn\u2019t battery-powered) next year.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the Ring Fetch, which is a connected dog tag and tracker. This lets you geofence your yard and will ping you when your furry friend leaves a set perimeter. Again, Amazon didn\u2019t go too hard on the details here but says this will release next year.\n\nThe Fetch was announced as one of the first devices to use Amazon Sidewalk, a new low-bandwidth wireless protocol that uses the free 900MHz wireless spectrum. Again, Amazon is being light on specifics, but it\u2019s pitching Sidewalk as a way to extend the distance where you can control simplistic, low-power, and low-cost Internet of Things devices when you\u2019re outside of home Wi-Fi or Bluetooth range. The company says Sidewalk will have built-in support for automatic software updates and that it can work from distances over 500 meters to a mile using other access points.\n\nAmazon gave the example of a sensor in your mailbox that uses Sidewalk to let you know when your mail is delivered or a weather station that uses the network to tell you how much rain has fallen. The company says it tested the mesh network by sending 700 access points to households in Los Angeles and had the LA Basin \u201ccompletely covered\u201d in three weeks.\n\nIn the case of the Fetch tag, if Sidewalk becomes widespread, it could feasibly allow you to track your dog\u2019s location if it ever wanders beyond your yard. Amazon launched the Sidewalk protocol on Wednesday but admits it\u2019s still early days and didn\u2019t go into further detail on availability. Either way, it looks like it will be joining an already crowded field of wireless IoT standards that includes Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Thread, which are already used by Amazon\u2019s own Echo, Ring, and Eero devices, respectively.\n\nIn any event, all the Ring-related news comes as the company has faced heightened scrutiny for working with more than 400 law enforcement agencies. Critics fear that Amazon is helping enable a surveillance network for police in exchange for marketing boosts.\n\nListing image by Amazon", "description": "Plus, a connected dog tag (yep) that uses Amazon's new wireless IoT protocol.", "authors": ["Jeff Dunn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
