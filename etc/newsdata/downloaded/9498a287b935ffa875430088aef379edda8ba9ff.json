He insisted that the pound should be free to float, and accused critics of \u201cselling this country short\u201d.\n\nClaims that investors who backed Johnson, or the leave campaign, would win billions from the collapse of sterling were simply wrong, Clarke insisted.\n\nAnd he told several MPs that the best way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to support efforts to leave with a good deal.\n\nBut opposition MPs fear that City speculators are hoping to profit from a disorderly Brexit - as the Treasury\u2019s former top civil servant, Nick Macpherson, has warned. Labour\u2019s Tracey Brabin said it was simply immoral for speculators to profit from the pain and disruption that a no-deal Brexit would cause.", "description": "Rolling coverage of the day\u2019s political developments, including Brexit and the Conservative party conference", "authors": ["Andrew Sparrow", "Kevin Rawlinson", "Rowena Mason", "Lisa O'Carroll", "Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe0a60dea9c1d09be66941a226e87268efa31f8/0_88_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b191ef1c8613bb44506318fe8cf90724"}
