In this case, I think this is an appropriate punishment, and although I wish we didn't have to use my new law, I'm so happy women are coming forward, using it and being supported.\"\n\nNew figures released on Wednesday revealed four men have been convicted of upskirting since the new legislation was introduced.\n\nSalim Ahmed, a 33-year-old shop worker, was the first person to be prosecuted in early July.

He was placed on the sex offenders' register for five years and sentenced to a two-year community order.\n\nThomas Hetherington, 21, was the third individual to be successfully convicted after seeking out his upskirting victim at a bus depot in Wakefield back in July. He is the first offender whose victim confronted him and directly reported him to the police for the new offence.\n\nAdditional reporting by wires", "description": "A lawyer for the UK government has been handed a 24-month community order after becoming the fourth person to be convicted of upskirting since new legislation criminalised the practice.
