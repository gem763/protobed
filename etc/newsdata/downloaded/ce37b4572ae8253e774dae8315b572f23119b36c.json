The trend has prompted traditional sports powers such as Fox, CBS and Disney-owned ESPN \u2013 which agreed this week to pay $30 million annually for the right to stream Bundesliga soccer matches \u2013 as well as newcomers like Amazon and Facebook to shell out massive sums for sports content.\n\n\u201cSports rights have been outperforming other genres. They\u2019re probably the most expensive programming out there, just because of the audiences that these games continue to generate,\u201d Tuna Amobi, director and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told FOX Business. \u201cGranted, in the last couple of years or so, the viewership has been a little bit shaky, but there\u2019s nothing else out there that draws this kind of mass audience \u2013 which is why advertisers love this, and to that extent, the networks also continue to bid those rights up.\u201d\n\nESPN paid nearly $1.9 billion for broadcast rights to \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d under its current deal. While ESPN is the frontrunner to retain the premium schedule when the agreement expires after the 2021 season, it will likely have to pay a \u201chefty renewal fee,\u201d according to Amobi.\n\nAverage viewership for NFL games rose five percent to 15.8 million during the 2018 regular season, with league broadcasts accounting 46 of the top 50 most-watched telecasts over the same span. Through four weeks of play, the NFL\u2019s ratings this fall also appear to be on the rise.\n\nWith Fox, CBS and NBC all locked into their own costly broadcast rights deals with the NFL beyond 2021, the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d package likely to remain under ESPN\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cEvery time any one of those deals come up, it\u2019s extremely competitive bidding, whether it\u2019s the broadcast networks or the cable networks. I think ESPN pretty much has a lock on that 'Monday Night Football.' My sense is it\u2019s a core part of their offering.\u201d\n\nThe NFL\u2019s recent experimentation with streaming platforms could add a new wrinkle to the competition. Commissioner Roger Goodell recently said the league has begun early talks with leading tech platforms about upcoming broadcast rights.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAside from the multibillion-dollar cost of traditional broadcast rights for \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d or other properties, the NFL and other sports leagues could look to break out digital rights in separate deals, according to a sports media rights veteran who spoke to FOX Business on condition of anonymity because of their ongoing dealings in the industry. At present, the NFL divides its \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d series between Fox, which holds linear rights, and Amazon, which holds streaming rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically saying, if [ESPN is] not willing to take a big increase, is there a way that we can carve out something for a streaming provider? Maybe that\u2019s Amazon, maybe it\u2019s DAZN, FuboTV probably less likely, but there could be some players who are interested in something like that,\u201d the source said.", "description": "Sporting events are one of the few remaining forms of programming capable of drawing massive live audiences amid the cord-cutting trend.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201908/229/0/0/854081161001_6074878931001_6074866468001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
