Let\u2019s hope they can persuade her to return to the cobbles once again!\" said one.\n\n\"Can @itvcorrie keep Debbie?! Please!!!\" begged another.\n\n\"Is Debbie really leaving the street already!!\" questioned another.\n\n(Image: itv)\n\n(Image: itv)\n\n\"Always wished Debbie Webster had been in Coronation Street more. I thought she had huge character potential, and Sue Devaney is great\" said a fourth.\n\n\"Sue Devaney really needs to return full time as Debbie. So natural, she's fitted in like a glove\", noted a fifth.\n\n\"Debbie Webster you\u2019re leaving too soon!!\" said another.\n\nKevin Webster got a massive surprise when his sister rocked up at the garage during Wednesday night's first episode.\n\nDebbie, played by popular Dinnerladies actress Sue Devaney, made her last appearance on the cobbles in January 1985.\n\nKevin's sister moved to Southampton with dad Bill Webster when he married Elaine Prior and has not been seen since until her shock return.\n\nDebbie caused drama almost immediately when she turned up to greet her brother because of some confusion with Abi Franklin.\n\nThe confused mechanic believed Debbie was actually Martine, the woman who had failed to show up for a date with Kev.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAbi gave her boss' sister a mouthful for standing Kevin up - even calling her a \"stuck up cow\" and asking if she wanted a slap.\n\nJust as they were about to come to blows, a stunned Kevin spotted his sister and asked: \"Debbie, what are you doing here?\"\n\nSmiling Debbie said: \"Hello you, long time no see. Yeah, I'm his sister.\"\n\nShe had returned to attend the will reading of her Aunt Vi, who recently died.\n\nShe explained to Kevin that her Aunt had left her \u00a3200,000.", "description": "Corrie viewers were delighted when Debbie Webster returned to the soap - and are devastated her return was short lived", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533698.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Coronation-Street-viewers-fuming-as-favourite-leaves-after-just-two-episodes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
