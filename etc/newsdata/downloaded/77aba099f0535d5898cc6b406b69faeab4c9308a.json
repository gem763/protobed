Amy Klobuchar (D-MN); and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 did well in the fourth Democrat debate on Tuesday evening.\n\nHowever, even the \u201cmoderate\u201d candidates support radical policies \u2014 such as extreme tax hikes, for example.\n\nThe moderators asked several candidates whether they would support a \u201cwealth tax\u201d \u2014 a tax on what Americans have saved after already paying other taxes, such as income taxes. (Neither CNN nor the New York Times hosts pointed to any authorization in the U.S. Constitution for a tax on wealth. The Sixteenth Amendment was needed merely to authorize taxes on income; a wealth tax is a direct tax not apportioned by state, and therefore illegal.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), recognized as the leaders in the \u201cprogressive\u201d lane, have both proposed wealth taxes. But on Tuesday, so did most of the \u201cmoderate\u201d candidates on the debate stage.\n\nButtigieg declared: \u201cI\u2019m all for a wealth tax.\u201d Klobuchar answered: \u201cI am open to it. It could work.\u201d\n\nOnly Biden opposed it \u2014 but he pushed for a doubling of the capital gains tax, to 39.5% \u2014 which would make the U.S. tax rate on investments one of the highest in the world, pushing money offshore to less punitive countries.\n\nIt was left to Andrew Yang to point out that wealth taxes had failed everywhere: \u201cIt\u2019s been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue projected.\n\n\u201cWe should not be looking to other countries\u2019 mistakes,\u201d Yang added.\n\nJoel B.
