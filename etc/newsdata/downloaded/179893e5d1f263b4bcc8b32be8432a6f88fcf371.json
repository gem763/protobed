All YouTubers who are currently verified will get to keep their verification status, and YouTubers who are not yet verified will still be able to apply for it once they hit 100,000 subscribers, as creators have in the past.\n\nOnly a single key change isn\u2019t being reversed: YouTube will actually verify that channels are authentic, whereas in the past it seemingly has not thoroughly taken this very obvious step.\n\nThis is all quite different from the original plan. YouTube had indicated it was going to limit verification to only established brands and the biggest personalities \u2014 people who were at high risk of impersonation. It meant that the typical YouTuber seemingly had no chance of being verified unless they became a top creator on the site. Not only that, but YouTube would even go back and strip verification status from YouTubers who it felt did not need the protection.\n\nRelated YouTube is taking away more than a checkmark\n\nThere was considerable backlash from the community after the announcement was made. YouTubers view verification as a status symbol, but it also helps them appear authoritative in search and communicate in comments. Losing that would have hurt their ability to thrive on the platform.\n\nYouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki apologized earlier today after seeing the feedback. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the frustration & hurt that we caused with our new approach to verification,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhile trying to make improvements, we missed the mark.\u201d\n\nOne other small change is still going to be made: YouTube plans to get rid of the checkmark used to denote verification and replace it with a badge over a channel\u2019s name. Because of these changes, though, it won\u2019t be implemented until next year. The changes were originally supposed to go into effect in October.", "description": "All YouTubers who are currently verified will get to keep their verification status, and YouTubers who are not yet verified will still be able to apply for it once they hit 100,000 subscribers, as creators have in the past.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NeFSQReezqLwmA9MRE0ThS6x_ZA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12861241/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
