The Salvadoran government has given them more support and resources. Earlier this month, El Salvador began deploying more than a thousand police officers, soldiers and immigration agents to its border. But today, there are no smugglers to be found. The convoy stops a lone driver. Molina says immigration agents used to have a passive role, that they could ask for documents only if the police intervened. Now they have the power to stop people on their own. Just a year ago, Trump referred to El Salvador in derogatory terms, but that seems to have been forgiven all around. El Salvador\u2019s new president, Nayib Bukele, praised the migration deal in a press conference with Trump.\n\n\u201cFor us, the United States is not only a partner and an ally but also a friend,\u201d Bukele said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to show that friendship. That\u2019s one of the reasons we signed the agreement \u2013 because we want to show the friendship to our most important ally, which is the United States.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "The number of migrants coming from El Salvador to the U.S is dropping, thanks to an agreement that the Trump administration brokered.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/El-Salvador-President-and-Pompeo-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
