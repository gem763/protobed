It was a garden,\u201d said Dr. Ann Marshall, director of research at the Heard Museum in Phoenix. \u201cOne of the things that we try to impress upon people is you just don\u2019t go out randomly picking in the park and get this kind of material. It has to be they know on a micro level Yosemite.\u201d\n\nThe reverence women from the Miwok and Mono Lake Paiute tribes and a man considered one of the world\u2019s greatest living artists had for California\u2019s Yosemite Valley has inspired an unlikely exhibition. \u201cDavid Hockney\u2019s Yosemite and Masters of California Basketry\u201d opens Monday at the Heard, known for showcasing American Indian arts and culture.\n\nRichard Benefield, former executive director of the David Hockney Foundation, said the 82-year-old artist, who currently lives in Normandy, France, is pleased with the pairing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s showing his work in a different context and related to something else,\u201d Benefield said. \u201cWhen you look at these baskets, they\u2019re actually drawing with straw and grass. It\u2019s a great sort of pairing of draftsmanship I think.\u201d\n\nKnown for paintings depicting sun-kissed Los Angeles swimming pools and landscapes of his native Yorkshire, England, Hockney created works from \u201cexpeditions\u201d to Yosemite in 1982, 2010 and 2011. He has worked in photography, printmaking, watercolors and other media. But he\u2019s never been one to shy away from new technology - as reflected in this exhibition. It\u2019s anchored by 29 drawings of Yosemite done on Hockney\u2019s iPad and then printed on paper.\n\nHe happened to be visiting California in 2010 when the iPad first came out, according to Benefield. Hockney decided to buy one and began dabbling with it.\n\n\u201cYou get true color immediately. You don\u2019t have to wait for the paint to dry,\u201d Benefield said. \u201cFor years he had his suit jackets made so that a sketchbook would fit inside\u2026he discovered the iPad would fit right in the same pocket.\u201d\n\nHockney still uses an iPad. In September 2018, a stained-glass window he designed on the device to honor Queen Elizabeth II was unveiled at Westminster Abbey.\n\nOther works in the Heard Museum show include photo collages from the 1980s, including one of Yosemite.\n\nBenefield believes this is the first time Hockney\u2019s work has ever been shown in Arizona. But he continues to remain in the spotlight elsewhere. An exhibition of his work at Amsterdam\u2019s Van Gogh Museum closed in May. One of his most famous paintings, \u201cPortrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), fetched $90.3 million at auction in New York in November 2018. At the time, the sale broke the record for the highest bid for a work by a living artist sold at auction.\n\nNow, he is working on 3-D photographic drawings, Benefield said.\n\nEqually impressive are the 28 baskets sitting in display cases alongside the iPad drawings. Most of them were made during the first half of the 20th century. The intricate objects represent the work of seven renowned indigenous basket weavers like Carrie Bethel, Lucy Telles and Tina Charlie. Most of them did their craft while working as housekeepers or similar domestic jobs, according to Marshall.\n\nNative basketry caught the eyes of outsiders during Yosemite Indian Field Days. Park officials beginning in 1916 tried to drum up tourist business during slower months with special events. Tribes could sell their wares to visitors. Marshall said the \u201cfield days\u201d gave weavers an opportunity to attract collectors that appreciated what they were doing as art.\n\n\u201cYou look at them and say, \u2018Where did that come from?\u2019 It didn\u2019t come from any commercial product they saw. It\u2019s just art,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt\u2019s consummate skill with a very difficult medium.\u201d\n\nThe art form is still very much a part of the fabric of Yosemite, which loaned many of the baskets. Julia Parker, who married Lucy Telles\u2019 grandson, learned to weave and went on to be a cultural interpreter. She was beloved as a weaving demonstrator at the park for more than 50 years until her retirement in July 2015. Her daughter, Lucy Parker, is expected to hold a demonstration at the Heard during the exhibition\u2019s run.\n\n\u201cDavid Hockney\u2019s Yosemite and Masters of California Basketry\u201d runs through April 5.\n\n___\n\nFollow Terry Tang on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ttangAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Decades before Yosemite became a national park and mesmerized visitors like British artist David Hockney, it was simply the backyard garden of Native American basket weavers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Terry Tang"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/27/david_hockney_native_basketry_99601_c169-0-5313-3001_s1200x700.jpg?e32a587bb23c3ed6e56fe869dbe64f6ad1582a39", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
