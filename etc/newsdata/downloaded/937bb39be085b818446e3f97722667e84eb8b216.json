She teaches 4th and 5th grade and says she has 33 students in her classroom, many of whom need extra help.\n\nArt teacher John Houlihan says \"it's ridiculous\" that kids dealing with \"profound poverty\" and homelessness are in classes of 30 to 40 students. He says it's \"not an environment for learning.\"\n\nThe strike started Thursday after the Chicago Teachers Union and the nation's third-largest school district failed to reach a contract deal.\n\nThird grade teacher Gay Niemeier pickets outside Sawyer Elementary School in Chicago, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, on the first day of a teacher's strike.

The strike follows months of negotiations between the union and Chicago Public Schools that failed to resolve disputes over pay and benefits, class size and teacher preparation time.\n\nUnion President Jesse Sharkey says they want a \"short strike.\"\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot was disappointed by the strike decision.\n\nThe strike is Chicago's first major walkout by teachers since 2012 and city officials announced early Wednesday that all classes were canceled for Thursday in hopes of giving more planning time to the parents of more than 300,000 students.\n\nTeachers pickets outside Sawyer Elementary School in Chicago, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, on the first day of a teacher's strike.
