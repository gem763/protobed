I\u2019m totally fine! No idea what happened [cry-laughing emoijis],\u2019 she tweeted. \u2018So sorry . But so proud of @mikebreakfast for carrying on and delivering \u201cthe dolphin\u201d!\u2019\n\nFYI I did it again on purpose in Claudia\u2019s area! And im def not drunk as some people think. \u2014 katya Jones (@Mrs_katjones) October 5, 2019\n\nThe star added: \u2018FYI I did it again on purpose in Claudia\u2019s area! And im def not drunk as some people think.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pro dancer, who previously faced controversy when she was pictured last year snogging her dance partner Seann Walsh, performed a raunchy dance to The Weather Girls\u2019 It\u2019s Raining Men with her partner but one move went just a little (a lot) wrong.\n\nAfter a lovely spin and following Mike across the studio, Katya dropped to the floor \u2013 with some fans assuming he was meant to be there to catch her.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t quite magic, it was nearly tragic in parts,\u2019 judge Bruno Tonioli asserted, with Katya insisting: \u2018It wasn\u2019t his fault!\u2019\n\nFans were shocked by the unfortunate mishap, with one writing on Twitter: \u2018Katya actually styled this out really well,\u2019 and another adding: \u2018WAIT did Katya just fall over.\u2019\n\nThe pair earned a score of 18 from the judges for their dance, which saw the journalist sliding down a fireman\u2019s pole before ripping off the uniform to reveal his glittery outfit.\n\nAt least they had fun, right?\n\nStrictly Come Dancing returns tomorrow at 7.15 on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
