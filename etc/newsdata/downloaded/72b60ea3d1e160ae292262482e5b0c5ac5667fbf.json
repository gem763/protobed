If they have solid private insurance that they want to keep, they should be able to do that.\"\n\nCastro argued that while his plan would automatically enroll people who didn't have private insurance into a public option when they lost their jobs, for example, Biden's would require people to actively enroll.\n\n\"The difference between what I support and what you support is that you require them to opt-in, and I do not require them to opt in,\" Castro said. \"Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered, he wanted every single person in this country to be covered.\"\n\nRead more: B iden touts Obamacare while slamming Sanders and Warren's healthcare plans\n\nBiden argued that people would not have to buy in to Medicare under his plan, but Castro pushed back, saying, \"You just said two minutes ago that people would have to buy in \u2014 are you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago?\" We need a system that automatically enrolls people no matter what,\" Castro said.\n\n\"I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not,\" Castro told Biden, to which Biden shot back, \"That'll be a surprise to him.\"\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg admonished both Castro and Biden, saying, \"This is why presidential debates have become unwatchable, this reminds people of what they cannot stand about Washington; people scoring points at each other, people poking at each other.\"\n\n\"That's what a Democratic primary election is, that's what an election is,\" Castro responded to Buttigieg, receiving loud cheers from the audience.", "description": "Biden shot back, \"That'll be a surprise to him.\" This was part of a larger debate about health care plans from the Democratic candidates.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ae6822e22af1144090086-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
