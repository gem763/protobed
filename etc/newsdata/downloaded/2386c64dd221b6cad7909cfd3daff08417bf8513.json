'They will also hold the vast majority of judges who act in good faith to the highest ethical standards, and in the process, begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair and impartial federal judiciary.'\n\nMaryanne Trump Barry, seen here with her brother Donald Trump in June 2008, retired from the bench after she faced an investigation into allegations she and her siblings participated in tax fraud\n\nBrett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination was nearly derailed by allegations of sexual misconduct\n\nHer plan dropped on the first day the Supreme Court was back in session, kicking off its fall term. Currently the high court is the only court in the country without a written code of conduct.\n\nWarren's proposal also addresses other areas of the judiciary, including banning judges from deciding for themselves whether they have a conflict of interest in hearing a case before them; forbidding judges from owning or trading individual stock, and requiring Supreme Court justices to give written explanations of their decisions when a party asks for a recusal.\n\nFinally Warren would give strong disciplinary tools to judicial watchdog groups, such as allowing them to take away some pension benefits from judges.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren would re-open investigations into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry if elected president.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19413012-0-image-a-2_1570480345082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
