He gave the Giants their first win of the season after Eli Manning was benched following two lackluster games.\n\nJones finished with 336 yards on 23-of-36 passing. After the Giants fell behind 28-10 and star running back Saquon Barkley exited early with an injury, Jones led three second-half touchdown drives, capping one off with a complete pass for a two-point conversion.\n\nHe sprinted in for the game-winning touchdown with just 1:16 remaining:\n\nMeanwhile, Allen filled in for the injured Cam Newton and threw for four touchdowns to lead Carolina over Kyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals, 38-20.\n\nHe had running back Christian McCaffrey to thank for much of the Panthers\u2019 offense \u2014 153 yards on 24 touches. But Allen finished with 261 yards on 19-for-26 passing, posting a terrific 144.4 passer rating.\n\nAlthough Jones presumably will be New York\u2019s starter going forward, he and Allen provided the biggest highlights of what ought to be called \u201cbackup quarterback week\u201d in the NFL.\n\nTheir performances came four days after Gardner Minshew led the Jacksonville Jaguars to victory on \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d in his second NFL start. Teddy Bridgewater, in for the injured Drew Brees, passed for 177 yards and two scores Sunday to beat the Seattle Seahawks, 33-27.\n\nBut of the six backups who had to start this week, not all of them left the field with smiles on their faces. With Ben Roethlisberger ruled out for the year, Mason Rudolph couldn\u2019t carry the Pittsburgh Steelers past the San Francisco 49ers, and Pittsburgh fell to 0-3.\n\nSame for the New York Jets and Luke Falk, their third starting QB in three weeks after Sam Darnold contracted mononucleosis and Trevor Siemian hurt his ankle. The Patriots walked over Falk and the Jets, 30-14 \u2014 and Falk and the Jets offense did not produce either of their touchdowns.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
