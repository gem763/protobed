The Municipalists imagines a fictionalized city where gentrification is fought through bombings, cashless restaurants are opened to shut out the poor, and the antihero is an urban planner. And Infinite Detail, set in New York City and Bristol, is a critique of too-smart cities that expertly straddles \u201cthe hardscrabble post-internet world and the uncanny near-future version of our own society that precedes it.\u201d\n\n\u200bEvery Friday in the Books Briefing, we thread together Atlantic stories on books that share similar ideas.

But what is this going to look like in another 10 years?\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber, by Mike Isaac\n\nThe secret history of the suburbs\n\n\u201cAs opposed to the groups who went far into America\u2019s interior to settle isolated communes, these were, in a paradoxical-sounding phrase, practical utopians. \u2026 Their history shows that bold social and architectural experimentation is not alien to suburbia. In fact, it\u2019s a suburban tradition.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda Radical Suburbs, by Amanda Kolson Hurley\n\nThe dystopian novel that explains what\u2019s wrong with real smart cities\n\n\u201cWhat smart cities do is take digital divides\u2014divisions between who has access to technology and who doesn\u2019t\u2014and turn them into physical divides.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda Infinite Detail, by Tim Maughan\n\nThe buddy-cop comedy that imagines a war against gentrification\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing this book, an alcoholic artificial intelligence was the most outlandish part of the book. Now an ambitious, well-funded federal agency is what\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcda The Municipalists, by Seth Fried\n\nThe Reference Desk\n\n(New York Public Library)\n\nWrite to the Books Briefing team at booksbriefing@theatlantic.com or reply directly to this email with any of your reading-related dilemmas.
