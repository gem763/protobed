However, the project was not supposed to begin until 2021, and was for two \"backup\" silos for the 44 missile interceptors already on alert.\n\nThe senior defense official said the U.S. notified its allies Wednesday of the cuts. Congress was notified beginning Tuesday, the official said.\n\nDEFENSE SECRETARY SIGNS OFF ON SPENDING $3.6B TO BUILD 175 MILES OF BORDER WALL\n\nOverseas, maintenance and infrastructure projects across more than a dozen airbases were put on hold.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement. \"When the Senate returns next week, we should immediately pass a resolution of disapproval to block this unconstitutional action,\" she added.\n\nTRUMP TOUTS BORDER WALL PROGRESS AS PENTAGON SIGNS OFF ON FUNDING TRANSFER\n\nSen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the move by the Trump administration a \"slap in the face to the members of the Armed Forces.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., tweeted that \"Trump is about to weaken our national security\" to pay for \"his xenophobic border wall.\"\n\nPresident Trump earlier Wednesday said construction of the wall was moving along \"rapidly.\" He said he expected \"close to 500 miles of wall\" to be \"almost complete if not complete\" just after the 2020 election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building different sections simultaneously,\u201d Trump said, stating that by the end of 2020, crews will have built wall sections to \u201ctake care of all the areas we wanted,\u201d as well as \u201csome of the marginal areas\u201d that were of a lower priority.\n\nVarious forms of barrier are already in place on 654 miles of the border, roughly a third of the total border.
