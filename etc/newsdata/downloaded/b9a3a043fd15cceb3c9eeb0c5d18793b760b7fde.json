From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhen an urbane and unexcitable Westminster veteran like Lord Young, who has navigated 45 years in parliament without ever straying into rebellion, resigns with a warning that he is \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the course of events, it resonates in a way that a more hot-headed parliamentarian\u2019s warnings of a \u201ccoup\u201d might not.\n\nWhatever else Johnson may have achieved, prompting sober-minded figures like Philip Hammond to brand his course of action \u201cprofoundly undemocratic\u201d while David Gauke condemned it as \u201ca dangerous precedent\u201d and Kenneth Clarke \u201cplainly unconstitutional\u201d is a mark of the deep unease he has sparked even in the traditional Tory mainstream.\n\nAnd when the speaker of the House of Commons describes advice given to the Queen by her prime minister as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d \u2013 as John Bercow did on Wednesday \u2013 you realise that we are venturing into entirely unprecedented territory.\n\nBercow\u2019s comments were described by Jacob Rees-Mogg as the most unconstitutional thing that happened on Wednesday, and they are certain to be used against him by Brexit supporters who believed he stepped outside the neutrality of his role with the assistance he has given to MPs seeking to restrain the march towards Brexit.\n\nBut if he believes that a prime minister\u2019s actions represent an \u201coffence against the democratic process\u201d preventing parliament from doing its duty, as he said, then many would argue that the speaker of all people has a responsibility to defend the Commons.\n\nWhat he will do remains to be seen. The fact that he appears to feel obliged to act is an indication of the depth of the constitutional crisis which the Brexit process has led the UK into.\n\nYours,\n\nAndrew Woodcock\n\nPolitical editor", "description": "Working at Westminster, you get used to the fact that there are some people who are quick to reach for the hyperbole and routinely brand their opponents\u2019 actions an \u201coutrage\u201d or an \u201caffront to democracy\u201d.
