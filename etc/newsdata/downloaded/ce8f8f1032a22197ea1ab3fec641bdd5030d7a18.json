However, plastics didn\u2019t really enter the environment until after World War II in 1945 because that\u2019s when its production really ramped up. And that\u2019s all clear in the sediment core, which the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Cal-Echoes research cruise extracted back in 2010.\n\nInterestingly enough, the increase in plastics correlates with worldwide plastic production and the population growth along the Southern California coast that feeds the watershed where the team collected this sample.\n\nSo what does this all mean? Plastics are taking over. And this \u201cplastic footprint,\u201d as study author Jennifer Brandon, a biological oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography put it, is so stark that the authors suggest it could serve as a geological proxy in the sedimentary record. Scientists have dubbed the current period we\u2019re living in the Great Acceleration to mark our exploding industrial activity and its impact on the planet.\n\nTypically, geologists rely on radioisotopes to flag the beginning and ends of eras, but the team behind this study thinks plastics can be the marker for when this new type of geological began.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the ocean sediment tells a clear story of the world\u2019s growing reliance on plastic. Between 1945 and 2009, the rate of plastic deposition doubled every 15 years on average. And the plastics found in the core aren\u2019t just the fragments people typically think of when they hear the word microplastics. Most of the plastics \u2014 67.5 per cent \u2014 found in the post-1945 core are fibres. Yes, you read right: fibres from clothes. And oddly enough, most of the fibres they found were white.\n\nBehold, the sediment core. (Photo: William Jones)\n\nReducing the use of plastic straws and bags is important, but a growing body of research shows our clothing choices play a large role in harming the marine environment.\n\nThat\u2019s a tougher problem to solve, Brandon said, but it\u2019s not impossible. Perhaps governments can ban certain fabrics or incentive corporations to use non-synthetic fibres. Otherwise, it\u2019s all on the consumer, and shopping is hard enough when you\u2019re not thinking about the oceans.\n\n\u201cI think all the bans on styrofoam and straws are low-hanging fruit, but I can tell you to not use straws,\u201d Brandon told Gizmodo. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you to not wear clothes.\u201d\n\nWhile this study is telling, a single core isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of what cores elsewhere in the ocean will look like. More cores from different locations would help illustrate the global impact plastics are having on our oceans. Still, that\u2019s tough because most oceans are full of life and motion.\n\nIn comparison, the Santa Barbara Basin becomes devoid of oxygen as you inch away from the surface so there aren\u2019t living things there, and Brandon said it also experiences little circulation. That makes it the perfect location to collect a sediment core to analyse for plastic in some ways. Nothing\u2019s mixing up the plastics, and they just fall where they land.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt about it, though: Plastics are taking over the world. From the tops of mountains to the table salt in your kitchen, they\u2019re everywhere.\n\n\u201cI hope this is not our greatest legacy,\u201d Brandon said.", "description": "Take a look into the geological record, and you might just find... plastic?", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/etmbh17btkg0qstsfths.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
