He was accused of giving 7 billion won ($5.9 million) to a nonprofit foundation controlled by Choi in order to win a lucrative duty-free deal.Shin was jailed after the initial conviction in February 2018. The Seoul Central District Court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison and detained him in the courtroom immediately after sentencing. The court also fined Shin 7 billion won.An appeals court, however, freed him from prison last October, handing down a suspended prison sentence and canceling the 7 billion won fine.Although it found Shin guilty of bribery, the Seoul High Court said his offering of bribes was a passive act. \u201cThe president demanded the money first, so he passively accepted,\u201d the court said at the time. \u201cIt is hard to hold him entirely accountable for giving the bribes when his freedom in decision-making was restricted,\u201d the court said.Shin was released from jail after 234 days.\u201cWe want to issue an apology to the people for having troubled them,\u201d Lotte Group said Thursday. \u201cWe will bear in mind the advice and concerns offered by many and work hard to contribute to the country and society in order to regain public trust.\u201dThe Supreme Court also noted that its decision Thursday was consistent with its earlier ruling on a separate but related case involving Park, Choi and another tycoon.In August, the court ordered a retrial of a bribery case involving Park, Choi and Samsung Group\u2019s de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, overturning a lower court\u2019s decision that dismissed key bribery convictions. The court found that the Seoul High Court\u2019s decision of what constituted bribery in Lee\u2019s appeals trial was too narrow. It said that three horses given by Samsung to Choi as part of a sponsorship of her daughter\u2019s equestrian training qualified as a bribe, as did Lotte\u2019s offering of the 7 billion won to Choi\u2019s K-Sports Foundation, although that amount was later returned to the conglomerate.The Supreme Court also ruled on a separate management misconduct case involving Shin and other top Lotte officials including his father, Lotte founder Shin Kyuk-ho, 97.The court upheld Shin\u2019s conviction of having conspired with Shin Kyuk-ho and causing a loss to the company by leasing snack bars inside Lotte Cinema theaters to family members.The court also upheld the lower court ruling that Shin Kyuk-ho was guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust and must serve a three-year prison term. He was also fined 3 billion won. Due to his poor health and old age, the Lotte founder has not been jailed, despite a number of convictions and jail sentences in the initial and appeals trials.BY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/17203603.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
