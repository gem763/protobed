The present situation calls urgently for an integral ecological conversion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe culture of the Amazon, which integrates human beings with nature, constitutes a benchmark for building a new paradigm of integral ecology,\u201d it declares.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Vatican synod on the Amazon region has proposed adding \u201csins against the environment\u201d to lists of traditionally recognized sins.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
