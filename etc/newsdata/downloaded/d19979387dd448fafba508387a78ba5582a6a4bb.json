Overall, the gun group alleges, the ad firm often gave an \u201cintentionally (and wildly) misleading\u201d representation of NRATV\u2019s viewership performance.\n\n\u201cTellingly, when NRATV finally shut down in June 2019, no one missed it,\u201d the NRA fumes in the new filing. \u201cNot a single sponsor or viewer even called, confirming what at least some NRA executives suspected\u2014the site had limited visibility and was failing the accomplish any of its goals.\u201d\n\nThe amended complaint is just the latest shot fired in an ongoing battle between the gun-lobbying group and its estranged ad firm. The lawsuit, originally filed in late August in Dallas, blasted AMc for its handling of NRATV and demanded the firm remove any reference to the NRA from its website.\n\nPrior to that, the NRA sued Ackerman McQueen in Virginia Circuit Court to demand information about its billing practices and eventually demand tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThe National Rifle Association, meanwhile, has been embroiled in several scandals of its own: a ProPublica report alleging sexual harassment by a senior NRA staffer; vicious infighting among top executives; and reportedly out-of-control spending and debt fueled by legal fees, unpaid bills, and expenses on lavish travel, clothing, and makeup for LaPierre and his wife.\n\nIn a lengthy statement to The Daily Beast, the ad firm blasted the NRA\u2019s \u201cfalse claims\u201d and went after LaPierre, alleging the NRA CEO repeatedly \u201cdefrauded\u201d the firm. \u201cIn the final 18 months, AMc representatives progressively discovered that LaPierre and his executive team, with the board\u2019s oversight and approval, were marketing false products and narratives to NRA members, covering up sexual harassment, attempting to intimidate public officials, disrupting internal investigations about Russia, spending member money for personal benefit and more.\u201d\n\nAMc further wrote: \u201cLaPierre controlled every aspect of NRATV for which he recruited talent, approved every budget, audited every metric and required ultimate confidentiality. Ackerman McQueen routinely offered and toward the end of the relationship demanded that an outside firm audit NRATV performance but LaPierre refused. Unlike the NRA, AMc welcomes full transparency. LaPierre\u2019s apparent paranoia and lust for secrecy fed his justification for private air travel, luxury hotels and countless other expenses for himself, his family and friends that were all paid by member dues.\u201d\n\nThe ad firm\u2019s statement concluded by alleging that LaPierre and the NRA now \u201cgrovel at the feet of the media they used to decry\u201d by filing lawsuits against the NRATV creator\u2014\u201canother cynical attempt to distract from Wayne LaPierre\u2019s documented mismanagement of the organization and the captive board\u2019s complicit behavior,\u201d the firm added.\n\nMeanwhile, the NRA added in a statement from Michael J. Collins, partner at Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors and counsel to the NRA: \u201cThe NRA believes Ackerman McQueen breached its fiduciary duties, engaged in fraudulent billing, and failed to maintain adequate books and records\u2014all in an effort to enrich itself at the expense of the NRA and its members. The allegations reveal a pattern of corruption that included NRATV, a failed media enterprise the agency proposed, managed and sustained through misleading accounts of viewership and promised commercial viability. In the end, the NRA believes NRATV became all \u2018smoke and mirrors\u2019\u2014a vehicle touted by Ackerman for the sole purpose of continuing the flow of millions of dollars of fees which the agency needed to sustain itself.\u201d", "description": "NRATVThe federal lawsuit between the National Rifle Association and the ad firm that created its now-defunct NRATV outlet has taken an uglier turn, with the pro-gun group now alleging its own leadership found the TV outlet\u2019s messaging \u201cdistasteful and racist.\u201dAccording to an Oct. 25 amended complaint", "authors": ["Andrew Kirell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J3SRKtfgtkwoGtkyeW4nXw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/b3007ee3f0251bf3377eeeb0e331b8a6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
