It is currently allowed to open from 07:00 to 23:00.\n\nThe council said as it is in a residential area, the application should be refused.\n\nThe NNMA said it does its best to \"keep noise to a minimum\".\n\nAs reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, findings by the council's planning committee said it was not \"appropriate\" for the centre to open 24-hour a day, for five daily prayers, as it is \"located in a residential area.\"\n\nThe report said if the association wants to find a new base, \"officers can provide advice on alternatives.\"\n\nIt has been called in by city councillor Mike Stonard, and the decision now rests with the committee members.\n\n'Conflicting message'\n\nThe Labour councillor said: \"Most of those who live closest to the mosque - myself included - know how little noise is made by the people who attend and are quite comfortable with the proposals.\"\n\nSirajul Islam, from the NNMA said: \"It would be quite worrying for us if we are not given permission.\n\n\"Only our most dedicated people tend to come to the early morning prayers as it is and we always do our best to keep noise to an absolute minimum.\n\n\"Our last application gave us permission to use the building as a place of worship, but if we can not worship at the times we need to, it's a bit of a conflicting message for us\" he said.", "description": "The mosque wants to be able to open early in the summer so worshipers can attend morning prayers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7C97/production/_108659813_norwichmosque.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
