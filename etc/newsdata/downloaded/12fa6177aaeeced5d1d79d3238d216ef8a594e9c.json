Running right through the middle of that country, it extended five miles from the Canal on either side, including mountains and jungles and swamps and lakes (or slices of them), along with towns full of Panamanians who, back in 1903 when the thing was arranged, suddenly found themselves Americans, and just as suddenly found themselves Panamanian again in 1979, when we gave it back.\n\nIn the meanwhile, we ran the Canal, collected the tolls and hoped like hell that nobody took it from us.\n\nBack in those days before Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, long-range jet bombers, nuclear submarines and whatever nastiness is lurking up there in geosynchronous orbit that they don\u2019t want us to know about, the Panama Canal was a serious military asset. With the Canal, the U.S. Navy only had to build one huge fleet, not two: if we got attacked on our Atlantic side, we could quickly bring reinforcing ships in from the Pacific, and vice versa.\n\nBut that meant that there was a significant chance that, should the world go mad and everybody start shooting at each other, some dawn would draw back the curtain of night to reveal a fleet of hostile battleships and all their supporting vessels anchored off of Col\u00f3n, on the Caribbean side of the Canal, or Panama City, on the Pacific side.\n\nEven if they didn\u2019t sail right into it, landing troops as they went, a couple of hours of shelling by the battlewagons\u2019 massive guns\u2014these things shot projectiles 12 inches, 14 inches, even 16 or 18 inches in diameter that weighed more than a Lincoln Navigator\u2014and the Canal would be blocked by sunken ships and the locks and pumping stations that made the whole thing work would be turned into modern art. Assuming that day was anytime from the mid-1930s on, then swarms of dive- and torpedo-bombers would take off from aircraft carriers and take care of the ships and facilities further up the Canal. It would be months before those reinforcements could arrive.\n\nThe U.S. government didn\u2019t want that to happen, so they built forts and bases and airfields and barracks and whatever else was needed to keep the Canal safe and American. The forts had their own enormous guns, the Navy bases were home to all kinds of patrol ships and submarines, and the airfields were stocked with long-range planes to keep an eye open for that hypothetical fleet (this was before radar, so if you wanted to find something you had to actually go out and look for it).\n\nAll that defending took a lot of manpower, and come Saturday night that manpower was god-damned thirsty. The work was hard and boring and Panama was (and is) very hot and very humid. The Canal Zone itself was, of course, dry\u2014even after Prohibition, the paternalists who ran American interests abroad saw to that. But parts of Col\u00f3n and Panama City lay outside the Zone, and they had bars\u2014indeed, there was even a street in the former called \u201cBottle Alley,\u201d and that was a fair description.\n\nSome of those bars tried to avoid the \u201cwhite wave,\u201d as the gush of white-clad sailors on liberty was known. Bilgray\u2019s Tropic, the best-known bar in Col\u00f3n, preferred to cater to the local business community, or at least its sportier members, plus tourists and travelers and sports and gamblers of all stripes. It\u2019s not that the establishment\u2019s owner Max Bilgray excluded servicemen entirely\u2014he was a profane, tough Austrian who had once rounded up a couple of armed robbers at gunpoint when they tried to loot the bar he ran outside of Chicago, back before Prohibition. But business was business, and if he let men in uniform in they had to be on their best behavior. It was a place to find officers, not gunner\u2019s mates.\n\nOn the other hand, Kelley\u2019s Ritz, the best-known bar in Panama City, welcomed any rank of sailor, soldier, or even Marine. If they got rough, the proprietor, Mamie, who was as big and rough as any of her clientele, would put the offending swabbie, dogface or gyrene in a headlock, drag him to the door, and pitch him out on his ass. Then the floorshow\u2014as smutty as she could get away with\u2014and the taxi-dancing would resume. (If she wasn\u2019t there, anyway, she was probably up in New Orleans, where for a time she ran the Old Absinthe House.)\n\nMost of the bars that lived off of the white wave had the reputation for being anonymous shot-and-a-beer joints, bare-bones places whose very names are lost to time. But then there\u2019s Kresch\u2019s Place, on Bolivar Avenue in Col\u00f3n, just around the corner from Bottle Alley. Isaac Kresch, its owner, was a Polish Jew with an unusually high-toned resume for a Col\u00f3n bottle-jockey: before opening the bar in 1936, he had\u2014or so he claimed\u201414 years behind the stick in Paris, Monte Carlo, Rome and South America. We know he catered to servicemen because of something else he did that was unorthodox: he published a drink book.\n\nAt 2 \u00be inches by 4 1/8 inches, Kresch\u2019s Place, as the work in question is titled, is tiny. But this cheaply-printed little 112-page paperback\u2014really, just a fat brochure\u2014is one of the most valuable drink books I own. It\u2019s valuable because it\u2019s very, very rare. There\u2019s no doubt his was a white-wave bar: right there in the four-color panorama that graces the cover you can pick out a couple of ordinary sailors, a soldier and an Army officer, all drinking under the pines alongside the lightly-dressed women and shifty civilians. Then there are the drinks\u2014but we\u2019ll get to them.\n\nNow, you would think that a white-wave bar had no business putting out a drink book in the first place, and if it did, it\u2019s difficult to see what use its patrons would have had for the thing: Navy ships were dry and so were the Army bases in the Zone, so it\u2019s not like the servicemen who thronged his place would be playing around with the recipes back in their quarters. But who knows? Because the book is definitely aimed right at them.\n\nWe know that because of the drinks: of the booklet\u2019s 138 recipes, nestled in there among the booze ads, beer ads, toasts, random poems and song lyrics, 24 are explicitly dedicated to military institutions: forts, bases, ships, submarines, naval air squadrons, even the MPs out of tiny Fort de Lesseps, which housed a pair of six-inch guns and a large swimming pool (ok, life in Panama wasn\u2019t all bad) at the tip of the Col\u00f3n peninsula. Most of the remaining drinks are standards, but there are a few other originals dedicated to various individuals, some of whom sound suspiciously like they might have known their way around a parade ground. Blackie Holland and Shagg Stebbins, for example, each of whom get a cocktail. Research on them comes up dry, but if I had to guess I\u2019d have them pegged for Chief Petty Officers or Gunnery Sergeants.\n\nNow, I can\u2019t say for sure if all the crew of, say, the S-44, an S-42 class submarine stationed at the Coco Solo naval base, enjoyed Kresch\u2019s U.S.S. 44 Special, with its lime juice, Old Tom gin and sloe gin, but after sailing in that boat I would have. (What were the problems of the S-42s, according to Admiral Hyman Rickover, the grand old man of America\u2019s \u201csilent service\u201d? \u201cFaulty, sooty, dangerous and repellent engineering.\u201d)\n\nIn fact, by 1939, when the booklet was published, Americans could see the war the lay just over the horizon as clearly as anybody else could, and while the armed services were still volunteers only, there was serious talk of instituting the draft as a precaution. Many young men from the kind of background that didn\u2019t normally lead to the rough and tumble service life were volunteering so they could have a better choice of assignments. That meant that service culture was starting to get a little sophistication, and who knows, maybe cocktails at Kresch\u2019s counted as part of that. Or maybe, just maybe, the ordinary soldiers, sailors and Marines were like any other human and if you gave them a good drink instead of a bad one they took it and enjoyed the hell out of it.\n\nIn any case, war soon came, and some of the ships and squadrons scattered, while others stayed right there to defend the Canal. Of the ten ships that get cocktails named after them in Kresch\u2019s book, one\u2014that same S-44\u2014was sunk in the South Pacific, and another, the airplane tender U.S.S. Gannett, was sunk by a German submarine not far from the Zone.\n\nOf the drinks, the best I\u2019ve tried is the one christened after the U.S.S. Mallard, a Lapwing-class minesweeper built during World War I and converted in 1928 to a submarine rescue ship. It was stationed at Coco Solo throughout the war and presumably the young men in white who crewed it survived to drink other, and I daresay better, cocktails back home in Brooklyn and Keokuk and Bangor and Gunnison and wherever else they came from.\n\nBut still, Kresch\u2019s cocktail (unless it was the creation of his head bartender, Max) isn\u2019t half bad\u2014nutty and mellow and surprisingly sophisticated.\n\nHere\u2019s how.\n\nU.S.S. Mallard Special\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n1.5 oz 7-9 year old Panamanian rum (Colombian and Venezuelan rums will also do)\n\n1 oz Martini & Rossi (or Rossi & Martini, as the recipe says) Red Vermouth\n\n.5 oz B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine\n\n1 dash Absinthe\n\n2 dashes Angostura Bitters\n\nGlass: Cocktail\n\nGarnish: Lemon peel twist\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nAdd all ingredients to a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake well (as the recipe specifies) or stir well (better) and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. The recipe specifies no garnish but it won\u2019t hurt to twist a little lemon peel over the top. (Note that the original recipe only calls for an ounce of rum; this is a little better.)", "description": "We explore the bars in the Panama Canal Zone that were frequented by American servicemen before World War II.", "authors": ["David Wondrich"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567546867/190902-Rothbaum-Panama-Canal-Zone-tease_bzm9qz"}
