While purple shampoo is great in moderation, you could be damaging your hair by copying these challengers.\n\nEven brunettes have been getting in on the act (Picture: @rosewitdachalk/TikTok)\n\nMarco Coccia, Senior Colour Technician at WhiP London calls the shampoo \u2018one the best products to \u201cscare\u201d the yellow away from your hair.\u2019\n\n\u2018It is very effective on all types of hair but it is specific for blonde high lifted hair or natural grey hair,\u2019 he continues.\n\n\u2018The strength of this product changes according on the brand, the lightness and porosity of your hair and on how many times you use and for how long you leave it in for. I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s alternative to a proper toner but it helps keep the brassy tones away or to maintain a silver/white toner.\n\n24 hours is an awfully long time for a shampoo application (Picture: makeupbyabbyk/TikTok)\n\n\u2018Like everything the over use of it could, with time and depending on the level of the blonde/grey leave lilac stains and end up with the hair losing its brightness. It always good if you want a perfect blonde to go to your hairdresser and ask them about the best way to use the silver shampoo for your type, shade, texture of hair (for your individual case).\u2019\n\nKatie Allan, Founder of MAYFIVE Hair echoes these statements: \u2018Purple shampoo is great for keeping yellow out of bleached hair. The violet tone contracts the yellow which leaves a much cleaner blonde.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If the hair is more orange than yellow then purple shampoo wouldn\u2019t necessarily work \u2013 you would need a toning shampoo that is more blue based to neutralise the orange.\n\n\u2018If there is no yellow in the hair and the hair is creamy and light blonde already then the shampoo will deposit purple and you will be able to see it in the hair.\u2019\n\nBasically, as with any beauty fad, if you\u2019re taking it into your own hands you could see vastly different results to those influencers get.\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with using a salon-recommended purple shampoo every so often to neutralise the yellow in your hair, a more measured approach is once every week or fortnight.\n\nPutting shampoo on your hair for that amount of time could dry it out, and that\u2019s before we even talk about the implications on your colour.\n\nNot to sound like your mum, but please don\u2019t copy everything you see on the internet. That is unless you want your hair to be a purple, dried-out mess.\n\nMORE: How to be an activist at Halloween\n\nMORE: You can buy a Big Mac for just 99p from McDonald\u2019s next week\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "It might be the hot new trend, but could the purple shampoo challenge actually do damage to your locks?", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93914691_1572460006.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
