Porter had been the live-in lover of Williams from 1985 until July 1986, when, after several violent incidents, he threatened to kill her and then left town. When he returned a couple months later, Williams had begun a new relationship. Porter told Williams\u2019s mother that he had a gift for Williams, and he persisted in trying to see her. He tried to borrow, and then evidently stole, a gun from a friend and, a few days before murdering Williams, told another friend, \u201cyou\u2019ll read it in the paper.\u201d On October 8, he visited Williams, who then called the police in fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Porter\u2019s murder of Williams\u2014well after their relationship had ended and when they were no longer sharing a household\u2014doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201clovers\u2019 quarrel or domestic dispute\u201d to you, then you\u2019re not Rosemary Barkett.
