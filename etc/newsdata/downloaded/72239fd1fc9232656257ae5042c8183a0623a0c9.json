In total, around 80 per cent of respondents wanted to abolish DST.\n\nIn 2012, a bill to trial a three-year period of continuous British was abandoned because Parliament ran out of time to debate it.\n\nThe suggestion was however opposed in Scotland and Northern England because it would leave most areas dark until 10am in Winter.\n\nIt would make farmers\u2019 lives harder and increase road accidents, critics said. This continues to be the most powerful argument against changing current practice.", "description": "The huge attraction on London's Southbank changed its direction for the first time in its 20-year history for one hour to mark the clocks going back on Sunday.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/13/20179308-0-image-a-4_1572007143548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
