The last thing he wants to do is bring any heartache on himself or his family.\n\n'It's not one of his better decisions, but he was asked not to travel, spent a few days at home and started to feel alright.\n\n'He couldn't go to his parents' because they'd booked a trip to Prague in the hope of seeing him play. He's got no family, no girlfriend. So after the first half he decides that for a bit of company he'll go and watch the game in a casino, on his own.\n\n'The perception was that he was in there spending a load of money - not the case.\n\n'His dad taught him to play poker when he was younger, he played poker growing up as a kid with his father. But not everyone who plays poker is losing thousands and thousands of pounds.\n\nRodgers insists that Maddison isn't arrogant and watched the first half of the England game\n\n'Has he learned a lesson? Yes, absolutely. Because being a top player can be boring. It's systematic - in every day, train, prepare, rest, recover, play.\n\n'The players understand that I'm on their side, but sometimes you have to hit them below the belt. You can tell players anything. It's how you tell them that's important.' Maddison is expected to feature against Burnley on Saturday after recovering from his bout of 'flu, as well as ankle trouble.\n\nJamie Vardy will again provide the attacking thrust after being granted extra time off by Rodgers in the international break. During that period, his wife, Rebekah, became involved in a high-profile spat with Colleen Rooney.\n\nRodgers added: 'We were in contact when he was away, and we spoke when he came back at the beginning of the week.\n\n'I just wanted to let him know that we're here to support him.\n\n'He was back into his training, and for these guys, the release is to get back on to the grass.\n\n'Get running, get working, he's been great.'\n\nAccording to Rodgers, Maddison knows he still has improvements to make as a player", "description": "Brendan Rodgers is confident James Maddison has learned his lesson after making the", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/19840476-0-image-a-127_1571320714410.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
