Some of the most famous include: the SS Yongala in Townsville, Australia\u2014a luxury passenger ship that sank in a storm in 1911; Egypt\u2019s SS Thistlegorm, a British army freighter sunk by bombs on just its fourth voyage in 1941; the German Fleet in Scapa Flow, Scotland, which was scuttled at the end of World War I on the orders of a commander who didn\u2019t want the ships to become spoils of war; and, of course, the spectacular shipwrecks found at the renowned Chuuk (Truk) Lagoon in the Pacific.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

Those who imagine a wreck as a barren shell might be surprised to find these structures teeming with life, since shipwrecks act as an artificial reef that provides a habitat for coral and other sea creatures. Most of the passionate divers who come to explore these underwater playgrounds\u2014packed with colorful corals, sponges, tropical fish and even sharks and rays\u2014have little idea of the threat looming behind this beautiful ecosystem.\n\nDuring World War II, over 3,000 ships\u2014about 300 of them oil tankers\u2014sank in the Pacific. As they rust, many are at risk of leaking oil, which could devastate the underwater ecosystem. Fish exposed to oil can have lower chances of survival due to stunted growth, altered heart and respiration rates, enlarged livers and impaired reproduction.\n\nDetermining which shipwrecks pose the greatest risk to the oceans\u2014and getting to them before they leak\u2014is a daunting task. The majority of the Earth\u2019s oceans are unexplored and we have better maps of the moon than of the bottom of the ocean\u2014so how is it even possible to know which of these ticking time-bombs might pose the biggest threat?\n\nMarine archaeologist Matt Carter, Research Director at ocean research and conservation charity Major Projects Foundation (MPF)\u2014along with partners from The University of Newcastle, Australia, and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)\u2014is working against the clock to find out. He\u2019s just returned from a reconnaissance expedition to Chuuk (also known as Truk) Lagoon to establish the condition of some of the many wrecks in this diving hotspot.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 65 shipwrecks on the lagoon and 17 are on our list of highest risk potentially polluting wrecks,\u201d Carter told me. During this trip, he used 3D photogrammetry to create a model of the 9,627-ton Rio de Janeiro Maru. This enormous eight-deck passenger liner, which could carry over 1,100 passengers and 150 crew, has been lying on her starboard side at a maximum depth of just over 30m, slowly deteriorating since she was sunk in February 1944 by American aircraft.\n\nCreating an accurate 3D model\u2014made up of 7,331 photos of the Rio de Janeiro recording every single aspect of the wreck from multiple angles\u2014was, in Carter\u2019s own words, \u201ca bit of a mission.\u201d Capturing the photos of the 140m wreck involved over 3.5 hours underwater (broken up into three separate dives) taking photos every second. To make sure nothing is missed, each photo must overlap with the next by about 60 percent. \u201cSo, you can imagine swimming along and click, click, click,\u201d he described. \u201cWhen it comes together, it gives you a really detailed map of the wreck.\u201d\n\nWhile waiting patiently for the final image to be ready\u2014so large it took days to process\u2014he explained: \u201cAt the end of it we\u2019ll have a 3D map with the most detailed resolution of the wreck that there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nComputer software called Agisoft Metashape turns these thousands of photos into a scalable 3D model to help Matt and his team get as much information as they can about the wreck; creating a visual inspection of its size and measurements, exactly what condition it\u2019s in and where the fuel tanks are. You can even zoom into and rotate the model to get an accurate picture of its condition. The tool, he explains, \u201callows us to survey these wrecks faster and record them more accurately than ever before!\u201d They will then compile an environmental risk assessment which considers how much oil might still be on the ship and, if nothing is done, what the environmental impact could be if\u2014and when\u2014it escapes. The information he gathers from this modeling is critical in determining what should be done next.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the wrecks at Chuuk are deteriorating. Regular divers to spoke of seeing visible evidence of the wrecks collapsing over the years. Marine corrosion expert Dr Ian MacLeod, who is also part of the MPF, had previously estimated the wrecks in Chuuk Lagoon would enter a \u201cpeak leak\u201d period, when they start to break down, around 2015 to 2020. \u201cThey\u2019re really getting to the end of their life and collapsing significantly,\u201d said Carter. Time is not on our side.\n\nNor is the climate. While healthy oceans produce over half of the world's oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, and store excess heat in the atmosphere\u2014all of which help us avoid the worst consequences of climate change\u2014climate change itself is speeding up the degradation of these long-submerged wrecks. More severe storms increase the rate of corrosion and thus increase the chance of a leak.\n\nIt might be a silent threat, but the risk is significant. In 2001, a State of Emergency was declared in Yap State, Micronesia, when a sunken World War II US military oil tanker, the USS Mississinewa, started leaking oil in a remote atoll. A complete ban on fishing was imposed and the US Navy was brought in to conduct a major salvage operation, removing around 6,000 tons of oil from the sunken vessel. Many Pacific Island communities are worried about a similar situation happening if other wrecks in their waters begin to leak.\n\nThe 500-foot Shinkoku Maru oil tanker, one of the most popular dive sites in Chuuk Lagoon and another of MPF\u2019s high priority wrecks, was damaged by Typhoon Maysak in 2015, although it\u2019s still thought to hold a significant amount of oil. Diving this wreck on his recent Chuuk expedition, and seeing how much of an impact nature can have on big shipwrecks like this, was \u201ca real eye-opener\u201d for Carter. It\u2019s also why these recon missions are so important. \u201cWe\u2019d love to find out that there\u2019s hardly any oil on them left but there\u2019s no indications that that\u2019s the case,\u201d said Carter. With tankers still containing oil, another storm of that magnitude could be catastrophic. The worst-case scenario? A simultaneous release of oil from multiple shipwrecks.\n\nIt\u2019s quite common to remove the oil from this kind of dangerous shipwrecks. The U.S. Coastguard removed more than 450,000 gallons of oil from the Coimbra shipwreck in July 2019. The previous October, the U.S. Navy recovered just under 230,000 gallons of oil from Prinz Eugen, a capsized World War II German cruiser. While a preventative clean-up operation can be expensive, cleaning up oil from a wreck that has already leaked is significantly more so.\n\nSo, while Matt and his team are finding the information critical to mitigating the risks of a potentially devastating oil spill, what else can be done to protect the wrecks at Chuuk and around the world?\n\nThese amazing archaeological sites are incredibly popular with divers\u2014making tourism an enormous economic asset for the region\u2014so responsible diver behavior is important in minimizing deterioration. Carter explains: \u201cGood diving practices will help the wrecks maintain their strength as long as possible\u2014not crashing into them and kicking them will help preserve them.\u201d\n\nFunding is also an issue. While in many places this type of work is being done by the likes of NOAA (in the U.S.) and the Ministry of Defense (in the U.K.), for countries such as Micronesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomons, there\u2019s very little money available for this type of operation. Of the 1,200 potentially polluting shipwrecks around the Pacific, Carter and his team at MPF have shortlisted the 50 highest risk wrecks and are calling for support to help protect them.\n\nWhile there \u201chasn\u2019t been much done\u201d over the past 15 years of continued corrosion, Carter is hopeful of the increased concern for the ocean in recent years. Public support and donations could be a major factor in whether his team can protect the oceans from these wrecks. Whatever happens, it may well be \u201cright at the last minute\u201d because these wrecks, which are already collapsing substantially, \u201care going to rupture soon.\u201d", "description": "Exploring shipwrecks is a popular form of recreational scuba diving, and wrecks are some of the world\u2019s most famous dive sites.
