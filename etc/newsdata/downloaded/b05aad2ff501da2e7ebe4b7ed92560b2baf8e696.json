Smith. \"Third period we worked and that's all I've asked is if you've worked every single day and that was the first time we didn't and it was obvious.\"\n\nThe Canadiens improved to a perfect 4-0-0 in this year's pre-season with the win.\n\nKeith Kinkaid stopped all 27 shots he faced and looked solid when challenged. Jeff Petry, Jake Evans, Thomas Tatar and Phillip Danault also scored for Montreal.\n\n\"He didn't have many pucks, but we always say that about a goaltender,\" said Canadiens coach Claude Julien. \"When you don't get a ton of shots you need to keep your focus. What I liked about him is he made some big saves at times. They were really crashing the net, but he held his ground and I thought he made some big saves and he was pretty solid so I'm pretty happy with what I saw of him [Saturday].\"\n\nCraig Anderson stopped 27-of-29 shots through two periods of play and was the only reason the game was close as the Senators (2-1-0) were being heavily outplayed. Joey Daccord gave up two goals on five shots in the third period.\n\nThe Senators made no excuses and know they need to be better as the regular season approaches.\n\n\"We're playing at home and we're trying to be too nice with everybody on the team,\" said Ottawa's Thomas Chabot, who played his first pre-season game. \"This is a good reminder that we still have a lot of work ahead of us before the season starts.\"\n\nWATCH | Habs blank Sens:\n\nCanadiens score 3 power-play goals and shut out Senators 0:53\n\nLeading 2-0, the Canadiens extended their lead early in the third period, scoring twice in a span of 39 seconds.\n\nTatar made it 3-0 by beating Daccord glove side and seconds later Danault fired a shot from just inside the blue-line to make it 4-0.\n\nMontreal opened the scoring on the power play at the six-minute mark of the second.\n\nNikita Zaitsev had blocked a shot, but the puck went right to Petry who beat Anderson short side.\n\nMinutes later, Anderson made an impressive save on Nick Suzuki as the Canadiens were all over the Senators.\n\nMontreal made it 2-0 late in the period as Anderson put the puck behind the net, but it was Montreal's Riley Barber who won the footrace and passed it out front to Evans.\n\nThe Senators were outshot 18-6 in the second period and five of those shots came in the final two minutes of the period.\n\nBoth teams had some chances in the first period, but the game remained scoreless after 20 minutes.\n\nThe Senators are expected to make some cuts to their roster on Sunday as they prepare for two games in Vancouver this week.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 21, 2019.\n\nSabres edge Leafs late\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-3 in pre-season action on Saturday.\n\nVictor Olofsson scored twice, including the game-winner with 2:36 remaining in the third period to break the tie.\n\nOlofsson's first came in the second period.
