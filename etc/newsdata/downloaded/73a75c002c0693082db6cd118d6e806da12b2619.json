More than 12,000 people were polled for the research.\n\nAround 31 per cent of vapers said they were former smokers who used the products to quit cigarettes.\n\n\u201cVaping isn\u2019t risk free, but it\u2019s much less risky than smoking, which kills nearly 100,000 people a year in the UK,\u201d said Ann McNeill, professor of tobacco addiction at King\u2019s College London.\n\nA further 20 per cent said they had successfully quit smoking but vaped to prevent relapsing.\n\nIn the US flavoured e-cigarettes have been linked to a mysterious lung illness which has killed at least eight people.\n\nAt least 450 cases of the illness have been reported, according to health officials.\n\nDeborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said the reports from the US were \u201cobviously concerning\u201d but appeared to be linked to the misuse of e-cigarettes for illicit drug delivery.\n\n\u201cNothing like this has been seen in the UK to date, where a proper regulatory system is in place for nicotine containing e-cigarettes, which is not yet the case in the US,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cVapers should not be scared back to smoking by the news of vaping illness in the US.\n\n\u201cNor should smokers stick to smoking rather than switch to vaping. It is essential however, to only use legal vapes bought from reputable suppliers in the UK and not source illicit unregulated products over the internet.\u201d\n\n14 per cent of the vapers polled said they enjoyed using e-cigarettes, while 13 per cent said they used the products to save money.\n\nOnly 0.8 per cent of the vapers had never smoked. Of that small number, the vast majority \u2013 73 per cent \u2013 said they began vaping to give it a try.\n\n\u201cAlthough e-cigarettes are now the most popular quitting aid, our survey finds that in 2019 over a third of smokers have still never tried vaping,\u201d Ms Arnott added.\n\n\u201cAs Stoptober kicks off, we\u2019d encourage smokers who haven\u2019t done so yet, to give vaping a try.\u201d\n\n\u201cE-cigarettes have been shown to be a very effective aid for smokers trying to quit, either on their own or with help from stop smoking services.\u201d\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nPrevious research from the University of Leeds has suggested that young people who vape and do not smoke are more likely to try cigarettes than non-vaping peers.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nMystery vaping-related illness kills man in eighth US death\n\nWalmart to stop selling e-cigarettes after spate of vaping deaths\n\nIndia bans vaping after government passes emergency order", "description": "Some 3.6m people in the UK are vaping, a rise of 12.5 per cent in one year, new research suggests.Vapers make up 7.1 per cent of Britain\u2019s population, meaning more people are using e-cigarettes than ever before.", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.LqHN7CzT6IMWAm0adMLSA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/4c04de76166358e278875d0f5d0f8901", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
