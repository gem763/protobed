But a recovery in semiconductor prices and in the performance of the smartphone unit could provide a welcome lift.\n\nThe next few quarters should be a lot more positive, considering the rebound in the memory chip market. Demand for chips has been rising again, while stockpiles of key DRAM and NAND flash chips are declining, which should provide a tailwind to pricing. Samsung accounts for almost half of the DRAM chip market.\n\nThe positive initial response for the Galaxy Fold raises the prospects of further earnings gains through an expanded foldable smartphone line-up next year. Jhaan Elker/ The Washington Post[\n\nSamsung\u2019s smartphone sales could also get a lift from the revamped mid-range Galaxy A series, which is proving popular in south-east Asia and Europe. The positive initial response for the Galaxy Fold raises the prospects of further earnings gains through an expanded foldable smartphone line-up next year.\n\nSamsung's weak second quarter followed its worst quarter (in the first three months of 2019) in more than two years, when similar drivers were at play. Chip profits account for more than 75 per cent of group earnings.\n\nSamsung sales declined 4 per cent year on year to 56.13 trillion Korean won in the second quarter, driven by a more than 33 per cent slump in memory chip revenues to 12.30 trillion Korean won. Overall, semiconductor sales declined 27 per cent to 16.09 trillion Korean won, mostly owing to lower memory chip revenues. Besides lower prices, memory chip revenues were hit by inventory adjustments by customers.", "description": "The rebound in the memory chip market is just one of many positives for the technology leader.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1669%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a5e6f385a77f4eb2094174978791f95a5cec2b0e", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
