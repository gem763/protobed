I grew up in East Cleveland which is a very impoverished city,\" Carl said. \"We were on welfare. I remember the powdered milk, the government powdered milk.\"\n\nCarl Allamby CBS News\n\nAnd because they were so poor, young Carl quickly set aside his professional aspirations and focused instead on becoming the best auto-mechanic he could be.\n\n\"So this is the parts store where I got all my customers from,\" Carl said.\n\nSo you would work on cars in the parking lot of the parts store?\n\n\"Oh, yeah, sometimes 'til 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning,\" Carl said.\n\nEventually he got his own shop - and for 15 years, he did OK. Until one day, he decided to ratchet things up.\n\nCarl Allamby Chris Smanto Photography\n\nIn 2006, Carl enrolled here at Ursuline College. His intention was to get a business degree \u2013 to help him manage his repair shop. But there was 1 hurdle \u2013 a biology class. He couldn't understand why he had to take it and he put it off as long as possible.\n\n\"I'm a business major, what do I care about biology?\" Carl said. And in the first hour of being there, I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. All those ideas of wanting to be a doctor just came rushing back.\"\n\nAnd to make a long story short \u2013 the car doctor is now a doctor-doctor.\n\nLast spring Carl graduated from Northeast Ohio Medical University - and today he's an emergency medicine resident at Cleveland Clinic Akron General.\n\nCarl Allamby at graduation. Chris Smanto Photography\n\nBy all accounts, Carl is already an exemplary doctor. Partly because, according to his supervisors, he worked so long in a garage.\n\n\"You'd be shocked, actually, I think it's some of the customer service,\" said Dr. Rebecca Merrill.\n\nBut could you imagine, right now, going and learning auto mechanics?\n\n\"No, but Carl said he'll do our oil changes,\" she said.\n\nFortunately, Carl now has more important repairs on his mind. But this old auto mechanic also knows that, whether you're working under a hood or staring down a hatch -- your success hinges on your drive.\n\n\"I would hear people say, 'Carl, it's going to take nine years to become a doctor.' And I'd say, 'Well, nine years is going to pass anyway.' So I'd rather be some place I want to be than some place that I could have been,\" Carl said.\n\nAnd there's the prescription -- for the I-can't-do-it blues.\n\nTo contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com.", "description": "Carl Allamby dreamed of being a doctor but he said it wasn't realistic \"where I came from\"", "authors": ["Steve Hartman"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/09/6d37fee4-58ae-4a0d-842d-e317804b516d/thumbnail/1200x630/75c261f31686882dcd2e58e3b0382ae4/last-day-at-neomed.jpg"}
