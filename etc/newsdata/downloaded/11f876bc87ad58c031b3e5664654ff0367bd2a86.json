A challenge by campaigners against a ban on demonstrations outside the London abortion clinic has reached the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe experience of staff is not \u201cmentioned at all\u201d in the report and there is a lack of \u201ccritical evaluation\u201d of evidence from protesters, the group claims.\n\nSome 34 clinics are said to have since experienced \u201canti-abortion activity\u201d, including five which were never targeted before, the group added.\n\nThe letter, signed by 30 organisations and individuals, said: \u201cBased on these shortcomings in the evidence provided to the minister, we would like to invite you as the new Home Secretary to ask for a full review of the evidence provided and to look again at the possibility of introducing national buffer zones to put a stop to protests at the clinic gate.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is not a question about abortion, but about the ability of women to access legal and essential medical care without fear of harassment or intimidation.\u201d\n\nAfter the decision last year, campaigners accused the Government of treating thousands of women as \u201cacceptable collateral damage\u201d.\n\nMr Javid\u2019s announcement was also condemned by politicians, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who called it a \u201cshocking failure to protect women\u201d and urged him to reverse it.\n\nThe review received more than 2,500 responses from abortion service providers, abortion service clients, anti-abortion demonstrators, police forces and local authorities.\n\nSome 36 hospitals and clinics in England and Wales reported demonstrations outside their facilities. Of these, a small number reported aggressive activity, the Home Office said.\n\nShortly after the decision, the Government faced calls to create protest-free \u201csafe zones\u201d outside all abortion clinics after the Court of Appeal rejected a challenge against the first in the UK.\n\nThree leading judges dismissed an appeal against an earlier ruling that restrictions imposed by Ealing Council in west London on protests outside a Marie Stopes clinic were \u201cjustified\u201d.\n\nThe authority was the first to create a buffer zone in April 2018 following demonstrations.\n\nIt imposed the public spaces protection order (PSPO) following reports of \u201cintimidation, harassment and distress\u201d for women using the facility in Mattock Lane, Ealing.\n\nRichard Bentley, Marie Stopes UK\u2019s managing director, echoed the calls for Ms Patel to reconsider the decision, asking her to \u201clegislate urgently to create safe access zones around every clinic in the UK\u201d.\n\nWhile Sally O\u2019Brien, the operations manager at its centre in west London, said learning evidence provided was \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d felt like an \u201cutter betrayal\u201d.\n\nThe Home Office did not say whether Ms Patel would reconsider the matter, but a spokesman said: \u201cThis is a sensitive and complex issue, which is why we conducted an in-depth review of protests outside abortion clinics.\n\n\u201cThe right to protest is a vital part of a democratic society, but it is completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harassed or intimidated.\n\n\u201cWe expect the police to take a firm stance against protesters who significantly disrupt the lives of others and use the full force of the law.\n\n\u201cThere are already powers in place for police to restrict harmful protest activity.\u201d", "description": "The experience of staff is not `mentioned at all\u00b4 in the report.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/00/wire-19418000-1570489414-165_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
