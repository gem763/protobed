REUTERS/Linda Sieg\n\nJapan has no anti-LGBT laws although many LGBT people still conceal their sexuality.\n\nBut couples seeking to register same-sex marriages have been rejected by local authorities because there is no law specifically recognising it.\n\nThe constitution, never amended since it was adopted after Japan\u2019s defeat in World War Two, says: \u201cMarriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis\u201d.\n\nAmending the constitution\u2019s pacifist Article 9 to clarify the status of Japan\u2019s military is a long-held goal of Abe and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Revising the article is highly controversial, althought it has already been stretched to allow armed forces for self-defence.\n\nFormer Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura last month floated the idea of adding same-sex marriage to a list of other potential constitutional changes.\n\n\u201cIt is important to proceed with debate without any taboo, including of the idea that a man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman,\u201d NHK public TV quoted him as saying at a meeting of local LDP members last month.\n\nThe LDP has said same-sex marriage was \u201cincompatible\u201d with the constitution and Shimomura\u2019s remark caused concern at a meeting of the party\u2019s general affairs committee this week, media reported.\n\n\u201cOne should not lightly make comments such as revising the constitution to recognise same-sex marriage,\u201d the Asahi newspaper quoted former cabinet minister Keiji Furuya as saying.\n\nLGBT activists including Kanako Otsuji of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) - the country\u2019s first openly LGBT lawmaker - say no amendment is needed to allow same-sex marriage because the constitution does not explicitly ban it.\n\nThey have submitted a marriage equality bill to parliament in June, but the ruling coalition has declined to debate it.\n\n\u201cI think the goal is to shake up the opposition,\u201d Otsuji told Reuters, referring to Shimomura\u2019s suggestion. \u201cIf they agree with same-sex marriage, they should agree with our bill.\u201d\n\nShimomura\u2019s office declined a request for an interview due to his tight schedule.\n\nA survey last year showed nearly 80 percent of Japanese in their 20s to 50s favoured legalising same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThe constitution did not envision same-sex marriage when it was written...but it was not prohibited,\u201d said Gon Matsunaka, head of Pride House Consortium, which promotes LGBT awareness.\n\n\u201cSociety and the world have changed and it is the responsibility of the legislature to pass a law in line with that.\u201d\n\nConstitutional amendments must be approved by two-thirds of the members of both houses of parliament and a majority in a public referendum. The ruling bloc has a two-thirds majority in the lower house but lacks one in the upper chamber.", "description": "A conservative ally of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called for discussion on revising Japan's constitution to allow same-sex marriage, annoying colleagues in the ruling party who are against it and also opposition parliamentarians who say enacting a simple law would clear the way.", "authors": ["Linda Sieg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436982491&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930RE", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
