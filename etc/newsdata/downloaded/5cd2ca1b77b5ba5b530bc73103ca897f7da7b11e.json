Boris Johnson has been clear this is simply the normal procedure, to shut down parliament for a few weeks at the precise moment parliament is debating a historic measure that will alter the country for centuries. It\u2019s no different from the way you shut down all the fire stations at the exact time you set a city alight, it\u2019s just what everyone always does.\n\nNext week Johnson will announce: \u201cNo one can go to the House of Commons today, as we\u2019ve filled it with leopards. And Iain Duncan Smith is sat on a beam with a flame-thrower while wearing a Stetson and smoking a crack pipe. This is all perfectly normal procedure.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s just a coincidence that the people who agree most fervently with this arcane method, are Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood and all the people who worship the God of Brexit by burning EU flags in the woods at night and sacrificing squirrels while chanting \u201cno deal, no deal\u201d in black cloaks.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSome people have criticised MPs such as Matt Hancock for supporting this measure when on 6 June he wrote to all Conservative leader candidates imploring them to rule it out, saying suspending parliament \u201cgoes against everything those men who waded onto those beaches fought and died for\u201d.\n\nBut we should give him the benefit of the doubt, and accept he isn\u2019t being hypocritical, it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t like those men who waded onto those beaches. They were a pain in the arse, and he takes any opportunity to go against everything they stood for. After all, they were fighting to protect democracy, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be a fan, so he\u2019s not a liar at all.\n\nNicky Morgan is now a keen supporter of shutting parliament, though a few weeks ago she said it was \u201ca mad suggestion\u201d, but she meant it in the same way as a contestant on Love Island, as in \u201cI\u2019m CRAZY, and if you\u2019ve got a mad suggestion I\u2019m IN baby, weeeehaaaaah\u201d.\n\nAmber Rudd said something along the lines of \u201cI would happily Velcro my own children to a barbecue and grill them while pouring on extra lighter fuel, rather than consider no deal\u201d, but would now explain herself by saying \u201cI can\u2019t stand my children so this has all worked out perfectly.\u201d\n\nBecause the important thing is that we carry out the will of the people, and take back control for parliament by shutting down parliament. We must heed the words of Rees-Mogg when he says wisely: \u201cIt\u2019s time to withdraw power from the elite, as I said this morning in Latin before my daily joust.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

What would no one think, if we ignored the vote they didn\u2019t make? It would be dreadful if no one decided to never trust the democratic system again, so it\u2019s vital we protect democracy by doing something we promised wouldn\u2019t happen, and to make sure it happens by shutting down our democracy.\n\nIt may not take the most astute strategist to work out that Johnson is trying to remove all obstacles to his aim of delivering Brexit, no matter what sort of Brexit it is. Which is why it\u2019s quite sweet that so much of the opposition has no idea how to respond.\n\nIt appears to have placed the Liberal Democrats in an awkward position, so they make announcements such as: \u201cWe believe a no-deal Brexit is worse than the bubonic plague that ravaged 14th-century Europe. But rather than come together with Labour to stop it, we prefer telling Boris Johnson he\u2019s a cheeky so-and-so, and hopefully he\u2019ll take notice.\u201d\n\nJo Swinson spent almost all her interview on Newsnight on Wednesday lamenting what a difficult position this has put the Queen in, and you can understand why. It goes without saying that it\u2019s awkward when a prime minister tramples on centuries of democracy to force through a historic change to society to satisfy a handful of maniacs and an insane American president. But what\u2019s really heartbreaking, is the fact that the Queen had to spend five minutes looking up \u201cproroguing\u201d on Wikipedia when she\u2019d been looking forward to watching Pointless.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear majority of MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit, so it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to vote Johnson\u2019s government down. But that would be too grubby, so it\u2019s better if they all squabble between themselves and come up with delightful plans such as \u201cprogrammes of legislation thinginess and wotsit\u201d. Or announcing: \u201cWe\u2019re investigating the possibility of setting up a government of National Cookery, in which Dominic Grieve is responsible for negotiating with the EU, and John McDonnell is in charge of omelettes. This could be acceptable to Anna Soubry and Ken Clarke, but Plaid Cymru are demanding a leek from Brecon whereas Labour insists it must be from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allotment.\u201d\n\nEven so, Johnson shouldn\u2019t get his way in the long run, because scrapping all regulations on greed, handing the country to super-rich crackpots and monocled oddities, while blaming everything that goes wrong on immigrants, is not actually the will of the people. There are far more people opposed to this than in support of it, including the overwhelming majority of the largest cities, of Scotland, and of people under the age of 50.\n\nWhat they all need is a slogan, around which they can come together, to stop Johnson and his elite making their maniacal grab for power. Maybe we should try \u201ctake back control\u201d.", "description": "Why is there all this fuss?
