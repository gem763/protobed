Revenue was $40.5 billion, up 20% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated earnings of $12.28 a share on revenue of $40.3 billion.\n\nMost of the earnings shortfall was tied to an equity investments loss of $1.5 billion during the quarter, Dave Heger, a senior-equity analyst at Edward Jones, told MarketWatch.\n\nGoogle properties led the way in revenue with $28.65 billion, up 19% from $24.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Google Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat vaguely noted \u201csignificant growth\u201d for cloud in each geographic region.\n\nDuring its second-quarter conference call in July, Google said its cloud computing business is on an $8 billion revenue run rate, which means cloud sales have doubled in less than 18 months.\n\nGoogle\u2019s gains have led to \u201csevere competition\u201d that has eroded growth rates for market leader Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.89% and Microsoft Corp.
