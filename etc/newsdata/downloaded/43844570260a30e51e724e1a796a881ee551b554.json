That\u2019s crazy. And we\u2019re the only ones (with this system), and that is depressing.\u201d\n\nAfter researching medical tourism options, she saved up the money and contacted a specialist agency to organize her trip over the border to Tijuana, where weight-loss operations and dental treatments are popular.\n\nOthers travel to the Mexican city for treatment of cardiovascular conditions or cancer, orthopedic work and fertility care, as well as to buy medications.\n\n\u201cIf I only could have done it in the US\u2026 (but) I can\u2019t pay that much money,\u201d she told AFP. \u201cI just want to be healthy.\u201d\n\n\u2013 No price regulation \u2013\n\nEach year, an estimated 20 million \u201cmedical tourists\u201d seek treatment around the world, according to Patients Beyond Borders.\n\nAbout 1.9 million of those people are Americans.\n\nMexico and Colombia \u2014 which many Americans associate more with drug trafficking than health care \u2014 are among the most popular destinations, along with Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThey all offer lower costs and high-quality infrastructure.\n\nBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential election, have proposed universal health coverage \u2014 an idea that Merrill considers \u201clogical.\u201d\n\nFor now, Merrill turned to a company called Medical Tourism Corporation to organize every detail of her trip \u2014 including her flight from Phoenix to San Diego, the driver who took her across the border and a luxury hotel.\n\nAltogether, the tickets, hotel and surgery \u2014 at the Oasis of Hope hospital, right by the border \u2014 cost her $3,880. She paid in cash.\n\n\u201cWe do the coordination\u2026 (we) have a destination manager in those cities who would help a patient with the language, the local logistics and things like that,\u201d said Deepak Datta, who founded Medical Tourism Corporation 13 years ago.\n\nThe company sends 60-70 people abroad each month to countries around the world, mainly Mexico.\n\n\u201cI operate on two or more foreigners every day,\u201d said surgeon Luis Cazares, who removed 80 percent of Merrill\u2019s stomach.\n\nHe said his greatest flow of patients is during the tax refund season in the United States, after April.\n\nAccording to Gerald Kominski, a professor of health policy at UCLA in Los Angeles, the US does \u201clittle to regulate prices, in contrast to all other high-income nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedical tourism from a high-income nation like the US is indicative of a problem with affordability, as opposed to quality,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 Universal coverage \u2013\n\nBut even if \u201cMedicare for All\u201d were introduced as Sanders and Warren have urged, Americans likely would not stop seeking cheaper care abroad, says Medical Tourism Association CEO Jonathan Edelheit.\n\nAfter President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reforms in 2010, which required all adults to have insurance plans whether through work or the government, medical tourism by Americans expanded, he said.\n\nSome employers whose medical costs \u201calmost doubled since Obamacare was in place\u201d sent staff abroad, he said, citing a company that saved $20 million in five years by sending employees for orthopedic and weight-loss operations outside the US.\n\nUnder universal care proposals, the US would likely end up with a system where, like in Canada and Europe, non-urgent procedures such as stomach operations require years on a waiting list.\n\n\u201cWait times\u2026 will push people to go for medical tourism\u201d to get treatment earlier, he predicted.\n\nIndeed, many of the foreign patients at Oasis of Hope hospital are Canadian.\n\nEurope is a sought-after destination for US medical tourists, though it does little to attract them, unlike countries such as Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nThe United States itself receives health tourists \u2014 its highly advanced health care system appeals to patients with massive purchasing power from Arab and Asian countries.\n\nBut that is a luxury Merrill cannot afford.", "description": "Tijuana (Mexico) (AFP) \u2013 When Veronica Merrill decided to undergo stomach surgery for weight loss, she found two options: pay $12,000 at home in the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/7aacf5_veronica-merrill-smiles-peddler-heading-united-states-bariatric-surgery-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
