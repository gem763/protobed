But some of its tech-savvy residents don\u2019t want them tested in their neighborhoods.", "language": "en", "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif. \u2014 Karen Brenchley is a computer scientist with expertise in training artificial intelligence, but this longtime Silicon Valley resident has pangs of anxiety whenever she sees Waymo self-driving cars maneuver the streets near her home.\n\nThe former product manager, who has worked for Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, wonders how engineers could teach the robocars operating on her tree-lined streets to make snap decisions, speed and slow with the flow of traffic and yield to pedestrians coming from the nearby park. She has asked her husband, an award-winning science-fiction author who doesn\u2019t drive, to wear a shiny vest while cycling to ensure autonomous vehicles spot him in a rush of activity.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that she doesn\u2019t understand the technology. It\u2019s that she does, and she knows how flawed nascent technology can be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not skeptical long-term,\u201d said Brenchley, who has lived in Silicon Valley for 30 years. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the guinea pig. I don\u2019t want my husband to be the guinea pig.\u201d\n\nBrenchley and others who live among the world\u2019s technology giants represent a surprising Silicon Valley paradox: Residents believe in the power of technology to change the world for the better, but they are skeptical of the role it might play in their daily lives. This is especially visible as driverless cars from numerous tech giants arrive en masse in the streets of Silicon Valley neighborhoods.\n\nSome residents say they\u2019re confident the technology can work in limited settings, such as test tracks or simulations. But the software that controls the cars needs to be trained on real-life situations: left-hand turns, bikers, children running out into the streets. And, some residents say, that brings a form of disruption that will tangibly change the fabric of their communities and could even prove dangerous. That became apparent last year, when an Uber robocar struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.\n\n[How does an autonomous car work? Not so great.]\n\nGoogle self-driving subsidiary Waymo says safety is core and the company\u2019s highest priority, and that the technology could make roads safer. The company\u2019s employees and families work and live there, said spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson, and test the vehicles, too. It\u2019s also educating the public at local events. \u201cOur vehicles are programmed to be safe and cautious drivers,\u201d she added in a statement.\n\nSilicon Valley types can be most skeptical of advanced technology because they know how it works and what its risks are. Parents with experience at large tech firms have famously cracked down on screen time for their children. Some tech executives won\u2019t let female family members ride alone at night with ride-sharing cars. Others keep their kids off social media indefinitely.\n\nThat same skepticism has landed on Silicon Valley streets. Residents are showing up to community meetings to express their concern about driverless cars, even though they still have safety drivers in the front seat. Posts on community site Nextdoor debate safety risks.\n\nGeorge Azzari, 39, spent five years in the Mountain View neighborhood on the doorstep of Waymo. He said the cars tended to form a trail down a small road near his home at rush hour, clogging up traffic.\n\n\u201cI basically would run into a bunch of these cars coming back to headquarters at 25 miles per hour on this tiny road. You can\u2019t pass them,\u201d said Azzari, chief technology officer at Palo Alto-based social impact start-up Atlas AI. \u201cI definitely drive different when I\u2019m around those things,\u201d coming to a hard stop or pulling around one driving particularly slowly.\n\nTech companies in the area have seized on automation as the solution to the problems of an aging population, pollution and congestion, and the collective ravages of the United States\u2019 car dependence, pitching it as a way to significantly cut down \u2014 or even eliminate \u2014 the dangers of driving. Contrary to the notion that self-driving cars are just another one of tech\u2019s sci-fi innovations, executives have argued that robocars are an inevitability of society\u2019s march forward, relegating the manually driven car to the status of horse and buggy.\n\nCalifornia has awarded permits to 63 different companies to test self-driving vehicles on state roads, according to state figures from Aug. 9. Among them are a slew of tech companies with a substantial Silicon Valley presence: Lyft, Tesla, Alphabet-owned Waymo, General Motors\u2019 Cruise division, Ford-affiliated Argo AI, and start-ups such as Aurora and Zoox.\n\nThe companies outfit their autonomous cars with complex sensors such as radars and cameras. They are frequently equipped with a cone-like lidar sensor atop a roof-mounted contraption that looks like an upside-down sled. Most are small SUVs or vans that stop and start with regular traffic \u2014 driving tasks normally left to the human brain. Safety drivers are in the vehicles to monitor the cars\u2019 performance.\n\nWhile much of the testing is done on closed courses imitating city streets or virtual simulations, real roads are essential in teaching the cars\u2019 artificial intelligence the myriad real-life situations it could encounter, the companies say.\n\nThat happens in Silicon Valley, one of the early homes for such testing. Companies have also started rolling it out in other states where it\u2019s allowed, including Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, to add a diversity of weather, road conditions and driving cultures.\n\n[Reality is going to stall for some time the advent of driverless cars]\n\nRobocars have become a common sight in the tree-lined suburban streets of Silicon Valley, dotted with California\u2019s iconic mid-century Eichler-style homes, where upper-middle-class engineers and tech workers reside and where their children roam on bicycles and skateboards.\n\nSome residents are proponents \u2014 or at least indifferent \u2014 to the autonomous cars on their streets. And plenty of people here are quick adopters on tech, demonstrated in part by the sheer volume of Teslas on the streets. Plus, some of the communities where the testing is taking place say that so far it has largely been incident free, with few complaints from residents.\n\nBrad Templeton, who lives in testing hotspot Sunnyvale, frequently sees the cars on the road. He worked on them, too, as part of Google\u2019s self-driving car project roughly a decade ago. Most experts in the field say real-world testing is needed, he says, something he agrees with.\n\nTempleton says a small number of crashes are acceptable when considering the eventual overall improved safety when human drivers are off the roads. He compares it to teenagers learning to drive.\n\n\u201cWe accept them driving, with very high risk, because it is the only way to turn them into safer middle-aged drivers. And all we get out of that is one safer driver,\u201d he said. As autonomous vehicles are trained, \u201cwe get a million safer cars from a prototype fleet of hundreds.\u201d\n\nBut John Joss, 85, doesn\u2019t think the robot drivers are that mature. \u201cThey drive like either geriatrics or 17-year-olds who have very limited experience of driving,\u201d said Joss, a magazine writer.\n\nHe said the behavior of hundreds of vehicles on his Mountain View streets has inspired more questions than confidence. In one instance, he said, a Waymo vehicle drove from 8 mph to 10 mph on a 25-mph street, gathering a \u201ctail\u201d of other vehicles behind, trapping vehicles at a light. In another instance, he said, a Waymo vehicle stacked cars behind a blind curve after struggling to navigate an expressway on-ramp.\n\n[Five myths about autonomous vehicles]\n\nKnowing tech workers well has added to his concerns about the risks engineers might be taking on his roads, he said. \u201cI have met, dealt with, interviewed and written about geeks for the last 30 or 40 years,\u201d Joss said. While they understand the tech they\u2019re working on, it doesn\u2019t always translate to a broader understanding of potential impact.\n\nOthers here see the testing as a nakedly self-interested push for profit, an arms race to launch the first driverless taxi service and reap the profits that come from being unburdened to paying drivers. They don\u2019t want to be the unwitting subjects of those tests.\n\nSally Applin lives in Silicon Valley and frequently ends up on the road with robocars. She said she tries to avoid them. She recently took a visitor around the Valley who snapped pictures when he saw a Waymo self-driving vehicle. She slowed down to stay safe. \u201cI keep a distance,\u201d she said.\n\nA review of safety reports in California found self-driving vehicles are at risk of rear-end collisions. Experts say the vehicles behave unlike human drivers and are hard for people behind the wheel to predict, and they jolt to a stop when detecting a hazard.\n\nAs Applin recently sat at a red light, she realized a driver next to her was going to make an dangerous illegal turn. \u201cHow does an autonomous vehicle sense that?\u201d she asked.\n\nApplin, who studies the intersection of people, algorithms and ethics as an anthropologist but who also feels the impact in her real life, said the introduction of these cars to the road is problematic because it means that she and other drivers are responsible when it comes to training the new tech.\n\nIn online neighborhood bulletin boards, at community meetings and elsewhere, skepticism has bubbled up among those in the communities who say Waymo and other companies have not provided enough of a glimpse into their testing methods, and their safety claims have not been independently verified.\n\n[Tesla floats fully self-driving cars as soon as this year. Many are worried about what that will unleash.]\n\nThose tensions came to a head in Palo Alto and Mountain View as Waymo held community meetings on its driverless-car testing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to storm City Hall if these cars come to Palo Alto,\u201d said one resident at the meeting, according to the local Palo Alto Weekly.\n\nOne resident specifically asked Waymo what third-party data, and validation of its testing methods, the company has on hand, according to a newspaper clipping in the Weekly, the local newspaper.\n\n[Here\u2019s what autonomous vehicles could mean for the Washington region\u2019s future \u2014 good and bad]\n\nWaymo said earlier this year it had hit 10 billion miles of driving in simulation, and in October 2018 announced it had reached 10 million real-world miles. It has also released a detailed safety report on its vehicles along with publicly available guides for emergency responders on how to respond to incidents.\n\nStill, some residents like Brenchley would like more transparency and data about the robocars they see on the roads. She also wants to make sure developers learn lessons from science-fiction literature: Heed the social implications of your innovations, and don\u2019t let the technology run amok.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re too excited. They\u2019re chasing the rainbow, and I just don\u2019t want them driving down my street.\u201d\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nUnderstanding the human cost of your smartphone\n\nThe world has grown reliant on lithium-ion batteries, but the desperate search for the ingredients carries a steep cost.\n\nThe debate over how to provide affordable urban housing\n\nD.C. housed the homeless in upscale apartments.
