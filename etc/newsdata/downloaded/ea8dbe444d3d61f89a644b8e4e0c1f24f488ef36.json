He wasn't involved in the new study.\n\nBetter adherence\n\nHerder said about one in four Canadian households say they have trouble accessing medicines they need, and this trial shows the importance of easing that financial barrier and adding pharmacare to the health-care system.\n\n\"This study provides clear evidence that adherence improves for those who don't have to pay for their own medicines,\" Herder said.\n\nThe idea for the study was born out of frustration when doctors discovered their patients couldn't afford the medicine they were prescribed. (Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nBeulah Jarvis of Toronto was enrolled in the study after she had trouble affording her $180 asthma inhaler.\n\n\"That was the albatross around my neck for the longest time because not having this made it very hard to breathe at night and sleeping was horrible,\" Jarvis, 51, recalled.\n\nThe self-employed woman said she'd skip doses, stretching the monthly inhaler to last two months.\n\n\"It was really stressful and there were a lot of things that I couldn't buy foodwise,\" Jarvis said.\n\nWhen she took her medications regularly, her health improved. Jarvis said she's also now better able to afford what she needs.\n\nThe research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Ontario SPOR Support Unit that is supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Ontario government, the Canada Research Chairs program, and the St. Michael's Hospital Foundation.", "description": "Giving people free medications helps makes them healthier, a Canadian randomized trial proves.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312541.1570482684!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/beulah-jarvis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
