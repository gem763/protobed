They have risen by around a third this year, helping to ease pressure from activist investor Third Point.\n\nNestle confirmed its outlook for organic sales growth of around 3.5% and an operating margin of 17.5% or above for the full year, pointing to strong momentum in the United States and its petcare business. China reported flat growth as infant nutrition slowed and sales at its Yinlu brand fell.\n\nIt decided to distribute up to 20 billion francs to shareholders over the period 2020 to 2022, primarily in the form of share buybacks, but special dividends were also possible.\n\n\"Should any sizable acquisitions take place during this period, the amount of cash to be distributed to shareholders will be adjusted accordingly,\" Nestle said.\n\nIn a separate statement, Nestle announced it would no longer manage its waters business, which posted weak organic growth of 0.5% for the nine-month period, as a global business. It will instead integrate it into its three geographical zones. Nestle's bottled water brands include Perrier and San Pellegrino.\n\n\"This move, subject to employee consultation where required, will help utilize Nestle's strong local expertise, better respond to rapidly changing consumer preferences, accelerate profitable growth and create synergies,\" it said.\n\nMaurizio Patarnello, head of the waters business, will leave the executive board at the end of this year.\n\nNestle appointed Sanjay Bahadur, head of acquisitions and business development, to lead a new group strategy and business development function that should help identify internal and external growth opportunities. He will join the executive board on Jan. 1.\n\nVontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said the announcement of a new buyback program was a sign of strong brand development and cost savings gaining traction. He did, however, cite the issues in waters and its Chinese Yinlu and Hsu Fu Chi businesses.\n\nElsewhere, consumer goods giant Unilever <ULVR.L> reported weaker-than-expected third quarter sales, blaming softer demand in India and a slowdown in China.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by Michael Shields and Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "Food group Nestle  plans to return up to 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.13 billion) to shareholders over the next three years and reorganize its struggling waters business after organic sales growth slowed in the third quarter.
