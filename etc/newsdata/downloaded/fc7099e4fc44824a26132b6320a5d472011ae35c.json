The conned consumers could check out the message \u2014 so long as they paid for an account, the FTC claimed.\n\nFrom June 2016 to May 2018, consumers bought nearly 500,000 subscriptions within a day of receiving the questionable wink, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAfter the customers signed up, they either read a fraudulent communication or a notice that the profile was unavailable, the FTC said.\n\nThough Match Group owns Match.com and other sites like Tinder and OK Cupid, the FTC lawsuit only refers to Match.com. While the FTC and the Match Group gear up for a court fight, romance scams are, sadly, big business.\n\nIf Match.com did, indeed, allow fake winks to lure people into paying for a subscription on the site, it doesn\u2019t look much different from the kind of tactics scammers use when they try to \u201cphish\u201d for lonely singletons who are willing to hand over money. \u201cThese kinds of romance scams are very targeted social engineering attacks, effectively \u2018hacking\u2019 the victim\u2019s emotions, rather than trying to perform a technical assault,\u201d Nathan Wenzler, senior director of cybersecurity at Seattle-Wash. accounting, consulting, and wealth management firm Moss Adams, told MarketWatch.\n\nIn a typical scenario, a victim meets someone through a dating website or other online space. The person claims to live far away and asks them to wire money for \u201cemergency\u201d costs like a sick relative, a car repair, or even an airline ticket so they can meet up in real life.\n\nCase in point: A woman came across a man on dating app Tinder claiming to be a U.S. Army captain and quickly fell for him. He had promised to take care of her and her children, according to a report from Gizmodo, if he could just have money to get home. By the time she realized she was being swindled, she had sent him more than $700.\n\nHow romance scams work\n\nConsumer have lost $884 million from 2015 to 2017 on romance scams, according to FBI and FTC estimates cited in Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit. The FTC received over 21,000 romance scam complaints last year, up from 8,500 in 2015.\n\nA usual con happens when suspicious suitors meet someone online, say they live far away and are in need money. The cash is supposedly for emergency expenses or a plane ticket to meet up. People can also get bilked out of their money when scammers blackmail them with compromising photos.\n\nLast month, federal prosecutors indicted 80 people in a romance scam ring that stole $46 million from victims in search of love online.\n\nThere are some quick tips to avoid scams:\n\n\u2022 No one should ever send money of gifts to online objects of affection who they have never met.\n\n\u2022 Be cautious about people who refuse to use photos of themselves and won\u2019t speak on the phone.\n\n\u2022 Running a Google Image GOOG, -0.41% GOOGL, -0.29% search on a profile picture can reveal if the photo is being reused from another place online.\n\nShares of Match Group are up 67% since the start of the year. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.24% is up 19% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.30% is up almost 16% in the same period.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed Wednesday, Match.com \u201cdelivered millions of advertisements to consumers touting communications that [Match.com] knew to be sent by users likely engaging in fraud,\u201d said the lawsuit filed in Texas federal court. If the consumers were paying customers, they never would have received the advertisements, the court papers added.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Match.com conned people into paying for subscriptions via messages the company knew were from scammers,\u201d Andrew Smith, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. \u201cOnline dating services obviously shouldn\u2019t be using romance scammers as a way to fatten their bottom line.\u201d\n\nMatch Group, Match.com\u2019s parent company, said it has been \u201crelentless\u201d in pushing bots and fake accounts off the site, it said.\n\nIn its statement, Match Group MTCH, +0.00% said the Justice Department previously opted against pressing a case \u201cand referred it back to the FTC who then filed a lawsuit against us today making completely meritless allegations supported by consciously misleading figures.\u201d\n\n\u201cFraud isn\u2019t good for business,\u201d the company continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why we fight it. We catch and neutralize 85% of potentially improper accounts in the first four hours, typically before they are even active on the site, and 96% of improper accounts within a day.\u201d", "description": "Consumers with free profiles were allegedly tricked into signing up to the service.
