He came forward for a Smithsonian Channel documentary titled \u201cPrincess Diana\u2019s \u2018Wicked\u2019 Stepmother,\u201d which sheds light on her relationship with Countess Raine Spencer.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY'S DOCUMENTARY: 6 THINGS WE LEARNED ABOUT THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF SUSSEX\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY PHOTO REMOVED FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE TABLE\n\nBurrell told Fox News that after witnessing what Diana endured, he\u2019s worried if Harry, 35, and Markle, 38, can enjoy a peaceful marriage with their son Archie, who was born in May.\n\n\u201cI watched [their] documentary and I thought, \u2018My goodness, is history repeating itself?\u2019 said Burrell. \u201cWhy is the media being so vitriolic toward Meghan and Harry, when all they\u2019re trying to do is help? I walked with the princess through those minefields [in Africa], as Harry did, and I saw Diana in Harry as he was doing exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember a journalist came up to Diana while she was walking through the streets,\u201d Burrell continued. \u201cShe said to the princess, \u2018Ma\u2019am, what do you think about being called a loose cannon by a member of the parliament?\u2019 Diana said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. All I\u2019m doing is trying to help.\u2019 And I heard those words as Harry was walking through the minefields [in Africa]\u2026 All they\u2019re trying to do is shine a light on people\u2019s plights in far-off places, who have no voice. So I do see history repeating itself.\u201d\n\nBurrell pointed out Markle, a former American actress, has been treated unfairly by the tabloids since becoming a member of the British royal family when she married Harry in May 2018.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S ESTRANGED HALF-SISTER SPEAKS OUT ABOUT DOCUMENTARY: 'SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS DOING'\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S \u2018PAIN\u2019 AND \u2018THE ATTACKS SHE FACES\u2019 HAVE MADE PRINCE HARRY DETERMINED \u2018TO SORT IT OUT\u2019: REPORT\n\n\u201cI just feel we should give them space to develop as a young family and as a newlywed couple,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe\u2019s only been married to him for a year. She\u2019s a newlywed. She\u2019s a wife, a mother, a royal \u2014 all in one year \u2014 as well as being embraced by a family who is renowned for not having really much love. They\u2019re not used to expressing their emotions\u2026 Do we really want to chase two people down the same path [as Diana]?\u201d\n\nBurrell noted that unlike Prince William, who is second in line to the British royal throne, his younger brother Harry is still trying to carve out his own role within the family. Harry is sixth in line after William\u2019s three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nWENDY WILLIAMS SLAMS MEGHAN MARKLE: 'NOBODY FEELS SORRY FOR YOU'\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE WANTS PEOPLE TO SEE HER, PRINCE HARRY 'AS A COUPLE WHO'S IN LOVE'\n\n\u201cWilliam and [his wife] Kate [Middleton], they have a road map in front of them,\u201d said Burrell. \u201cThey know exactly where they\u2019re destined. Meghan and Harry don\u2019t. They\u2019re trying to forge their way forward, and I just feel it\u2019s very unfair, as Meghan said, to have so much vitriolic media pointed in your direction. I think it\u2019s really unfair and I think the media should lay off of them, let them live and give then oxygen to develop a young family. Otherwise, we\u2019ll lose them.\u201d\n\nBurrell suspects that like Diana, the couple will eventually consider leaving the U.K. altogether to escape the intense British press.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM IS \u2018WORRIED\u2019 ABOUT PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE AFTER EMOTIONAL DOCUMENTARY: REPORT\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE ADMITS SHE \u2018NEVER THOUGHT\u2019 ROYAL LIFE \u2018WOULD BE EASY, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FAIR\u2019\n\n\u201cDiana was looking for a refuge to take her children,\u201d said Burrell. \u201cShe looked at South Africa herself because [her brother] Charles Spencer has an estate in South Africa. So the princess decided to disguise it by going to visit Christiaan Barnard, the heart surgeon. She was also looking for an estate or property, but she couldn\u2019t find one in South Africa, and security was an issue there.\u201d\n\nBurrell alleged Diana was considering moving across the pond.\n\n\u201cShe turned her search to America,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIronically, we had the plans for a house on the west coast of America in Malibu. It used to be owned by Blake Edwards and [his wife] Julie Andrews. We had the plans for that house, and we dedicated the rooms to William and Harry and the princess. Myself and my wife and the children were going to live above the house. So her future was turning towards America.\n\n\u201cAnd I do believe wholeheartedly that Meghan will want to bring up her children as half American, so they will need a place here,\u201d added Burrell. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they bought a place in the United States.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY TO TAKE SABBATICAL WITH BABY ARCHIE, WANT TO MOVE OUT OF UK: REPORT\n\nPRINCE HARRY APPEARS TO HINT AT RIFT BETWEEN HIM AND PRINCE WILLIAM\n\nIn the documentary, Harry told British journalist Tom Bradby Diana was on his mind while embarking on his royal tour of southern Africa alongside Markle and their son Archie.\n\n\u201cLook, part of this job and part of any job, like anybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of the stuff,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut again, for me and for my wife, of course, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that hurts \u2014 especially when the majority of it is untrue.\n\n\u201cBut all we need to do is focus on being real, focus on being the people we are and standing up for what we believe in,\u201d continued Harry. \u201cI will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mom.\u201d\n\nMarkle also told Bradby she hopes the public will one day just focus on the positive--the love the couple has for each other.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE REVEALS STRUGGLES OF BEING A MOM IN THE PUBLIC EYE: \u2018NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED IF I\u2019M OK\u2019\n\nPRINCE HARRY BREAKS DOWN TALKING ABOUT ANXIETIES OF PARENTHOOD, MEGHAN MARKLE'S PREGNANCY\n\n\u201cI would hope that people, the world, will get to the point where they just see us as a couple who\u2019s in love because I don\u2019t wake up every day and identify as being anything other than who I\u2019ve always been,\u201d said the former \u201cSuits\u201d star.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, I\u2019m Meghan and I\u2019ve married this incredible man and this to me is just part of our love story,\u201d she noted.", "description": "Princess Diana\u2019s former butler is worried history is repeating itself when it comes to her son Prince Harry and his wife, Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/19/694940094001_6096033185001_6096034687001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
