Frisch's pictures capture both the natural landscape and its indigenous inhabitants of among others the Ticuan, Miranha and Caixana tribes.\n\nThe collection comprises 98 albumen prints which were first published in 1869 by publisher Georg Leuzinger.\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nFrisch took up photography in 1863 and moved to Rio de Janeiro the following year where he started working for Leuzinger. It was he who commissioned Frisch to produce photographs of the undisturbed Amazon.\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nFrisch set off in November 1867 covering nearly 1,000 miles on foot or by boat over the next five months. He produced more than 120 glass plate negatives using the wet collodion process which required him to travel with a portable laboratory.\n\nThe process meant that the photographic plates had to be prepared moments before they were exposed in the camera with development taking place immediately while they were still wet.\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nMany of the pictures are in fact layered or composite negatives with Frisch often photographing his sitters and backgrounds separately giving the pictures a sculptural feel.\n\nFrisch's photographic career only lasted a few years but his prints are still held in a number of collections around the world.\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nImage copyright Albert Frisch / Sothebys\n\nAll photographs courtesy Albert Frisch / Sothebys", "description": "The pictures were published in 1869 and are believed to be the area's earliest photographic record.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DDE9/production/_109090865_285n10044_b8t94.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
