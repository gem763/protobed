He welcomed left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj with two consecutive fours in his first over as the pitch eased out for the batsmen.\n\nIndia drafted in Umesh Yadav for spin-bowling all-rounder Hanuma Vihari in their side while South Africa handed Nortje, 25, a test debut, replacing off-spinner Dane Piedt.
