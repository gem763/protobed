The car is a 515-horsepower twin-turbo Mercedes-AMG GT S, selling for $132,700 in 2019 form. He orders two and asks her what color she wants.\n\nIt\u2019s well-known that racing helps move cars. \u201cRace on Sunday, sell on Monday\u201d has long been a mantra. But now a group of exclusive owners are one-upping even the fictional Axelrod, and buying cars that are much more exclusive than that Mercedes-AMG\u2014and drivable on track days only.\n\nPerhaps the epitome of this trend is the Ferrari FXX-K Evo, the competition version of the LaFerrari hybrid. The program started with the FXX of 2005, and evolved to the 40 examples of the FXX-K produced between 2015 and 2017. Those cars are ferocious, with more than 1,000 horsepower from a 6.3-liter V-12 engine.\n\nThe latest Evo version, introduced in 2017, is being built as an \u201cextremely limited-run model.\u201d It adds a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) and an upgraded aerodynamic package over the standard FXX-K, with 23% more downforce to keep it on the track. Output is now 1,050 horsepower, with 190 of that coming from the electric motor.\n\nThe Ferraris would be worthless if the company didn\u2019t create opportunities for enhanced driving experiences on the world\u2019s tracks. Hence Corse Clienti, with the XX and (single seater) F1 Clienti programs. With XX, an exclusive group of owners\u2014who pay $2.6 million for a FXX-K Evo\u2014get invited to events and technical test sessions with engineers and test drivers from the Maranello, an Italy-based company. All the XX cars are eligible.\n\nFerrari uses an ingenious approach, describing the program as a collaboration \u201cinvolving a group of special customers in the development of the Ferraris of the future.\u201d What fun! Keep in mind that the car belongs to the customers, but at least for the first few years it remains in the automaker\u2019s custody, because they can maintain and deliver the high-strung beasts to tracks around the world. Customers, who might see their cars for the first time at the Ferrari test track in Fiorano, have to pledge to actually drive their prancing horses, instead of having them sit around as investment properties.\n\nDrive opportunities are at some of the most iconic world tracks\u2014including Laguna Seca (U.S.), Spa (Belgium), Hockenheim (Germany), Vallelunga (Italy), and Silverstone (England). Needless to say, it\u2019s an expensive hobby. At Vallelunga in September, a dozen FXX-K Evos and five 599XX Evos were on hand. A gala dinner was part of the event, as well as a visit to the Borghese Gallery in Rome, with its art collection, including works by Caravaggio, Raphael and Titian.\n\nThere\u2019s a hot trade in used XX cars. Knight International in England has sold four FXX-Ks since 2015 and is offering one without the Evo upgrade and only 900 kilometers (559 miles) on the odometer for 3.8 million euros (US$4.2 million). Non-Evo cars can be upgraded at any time by Ferrari, and vendors caution that it might be better to start with one that hasn\u2019t been so converted, then go to the next step when confidence behind the wheel increases.\n\nFerrari is far from the only supercar manufacturer to offer track-only options. Here are a few:\n\nMcLaren Senna GTR\n\nThis one offers 814 horsepower, via a four-liter twin-turbo V-8. That\u2019s 25 horsepower more than the road car. Part of the formula for the extra power was removing the secondary catalytic converter, which of course renders it unfit for road use. Only 75 will be made, and they\u2019re already sold (for US$1.4 million), of course.\n\nPorsche 935\n\nThis is a development of the GT2 RS, powered by a 3.8-liter twin turbo six. The dual exhaust comes via the 908 coupe. Part of the plan here was weight reduction via carbon-fiber body panels. The car, introduced in 2018, weighs in at a hair over 3,000 pounds. The red wheels are inspired by the original 935 race cars. Some 77 will be built, at a cost of US$800,000 each.\n\nMaserati MC12 Corse\n\nThese now trade for prices nearing US$3 million. The parent car is the MC12 GT1. Only 12 MC12 Corses were sold, at prices up to US$1.5 million. The Corse is a 745-horsepower car, with 120 horsepower more than the road-going version. There was only one color, \u201cBlue Victory.\u201d But, of course, money talks, and custom paint was available for a price. The Corse, with the GT1\u2019s shortened nose, is eligible for the American Le Mans series. And, if money is no object, you can take your track-only car and convert it to road use. Three of the 12 had that treatment from German tuner EdoCo mpetition.\n\nLamborghini Sesto Elemento\n\nThis one, limited to an edition of 20, also sports carbon-fiber bodywork. The all-wheel-drive Sesto Elemento weighs just 2,200 pounds, and was first shown at the Paris Motor Show in 2010. Its 5.2-liter V-10 (on loan from the Gallardo Superleggera ) generates 562 horsepower. A top speed of 217 miles per hour is claimed, and zero to 62 miles per hour takes 2.5 seconds. You don\u2019t get air conditioning or infotainment for your $2.2 million. The engine produces music enough.\n\nPagani Zonda Revolucion\n\nPagani first showed this all-business track car (the most extreme of the \u201cR\u201d series) in 2013, sporting an 800-horsepower version of the six-liter M120 V-12 from the Mercedes CLK-GTR. Bobby Axelrod would approve. Only 15 were made. Not for the faint-hearted, the Zonda Revolucion is capable of 217 miles per hour and zero to 62 in 2.6 seconds. The 2,359-pound car sells for $2.8 million, if you can find one.", "description": "Ferrari, McLaren, Maserati, and others offer ultra-fast special editions to be sampled on the world\u2019s tracks", "authors": ["Jim Motavalli"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-122092/social", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
