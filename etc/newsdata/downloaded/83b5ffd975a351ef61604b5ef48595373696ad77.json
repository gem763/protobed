Apple said at the time that the company had determined that, in a limited number of units, \u201cthe battery may overheat and pose a fire safety risk,\u201d and advised customers to stop using the laptops and to have their batteries replaced.\n\nMore than a half-million Apple laptops are subject to the recall, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission: about 432,000 units sold in the U.S. and about 26,000 sold in Canada.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency similarly responded to the recall earlier this month by instructions regional airlines to follow its rules from flying with recalled batteries. Several international carriers, including four airlines managed by Total Cargo Expertise, have since barred the laptops from being shipped as cargo, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
