After she proceeded to do so, she asked Daniel if he wouldn\u2019t mind reading the piece for her \u2014 a request which left him rather flattered.\n\nThe experience certainly brought the two co-workers closer together, and they shared something of a moment \u2014 although neither have acted on their feelings to date.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s clear that Bethany is starting to fall for Daniel, and Coronation Street have revealed that \u2014 in the coming episodes \u2014 she will share all with James (Nathan Graham).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConvinced that his experiences would make for a great article, Bethany quizzes James about the politics of being a professional footballer.\n\nAfterwards, she decides to share her short story with him \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t take him long to work out that the story is about her own experiences. In addition to that, it\u2019s also pretty clear that the story is about her love for Daniel.\n\nThe question is: how will James react?\n\nWhat will he have to say?\n\nCoronation Street continues on Monday 7th October at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "But what will James have to say?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20_09_coro_bethany_james_1st_04-b7d4_1570436037.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
