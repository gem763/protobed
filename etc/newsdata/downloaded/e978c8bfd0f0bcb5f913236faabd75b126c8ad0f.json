I don't have the means to pay.\n\nThe wife's barrister, Alexander Knight, told the judge Mr Haskell still has access to 'substantial sums', including a trust fund valued at around \u00a322m.\n\nMrs Vladimirovna Haskell describes herself online as a personal style consultant and artist, while Mr Haskell came to the attention of the British public in 2013 when he was linked with a buyout bid for Coventry City FC and their stadium, the Ricoh Arena\n\nBut Mr Haskell said: 'In relation to the trust, she has ignored the fact that it is discretionary and the assets are not available to me.\n\n'I have done my best to comply with the court's orders, but I've not been able to pay all the sums ordered.\n\n'I have taken substantial loans from my father, which have helped me keep afloat. She is aware of this.\n\n'She has failed to demonstrate to the criminal standard that I have - or have had - the means to pay,' he concluded.\n\nMr Knight however told the judge that the wife faces losing her home if her ex does not pay up.\n\nThe wife's (left and right) barrister, Alexander Knight, told the judge Mr Haskell still has access to 'substantial sums', including a trust fund valued at around \u00a322m\n\nHe said: 'We are faced with a dire situation. Mr Haskell's father is a very rich individual and up to date he has given his son financial support.'\n\nAnd although Mr Haskell has made some payments to his ex, the barrister said she is in 'dire financial circumstances'.\n\nMrs Haskell has been forced to borrow cash from friends to pay her bills, the court heard, and faces the threat of eviction.\n\nMrs Haskell's (pictured in an Instagram post) rent is over two months in arrears and 'she is struggling,' the barrister added\n\n'I believe eviction proceedings are now looming over her,' the barrister said claiming that if thrown out of her home she will have 'nowhere to go'.\n\nMrs Haskell's rent is over two months in arrears and 'she is struggling,' the barrister added.\n\n'Some payments have been made by Mr Haskell to date, but certainly she is in dire financial circumstances and struggling.\n\n'She has borrowed money from friends whom she has been forced to rely on.'\n\nAt the end of a short hearing, Mr Justice Francis said the extent to which Mr Haskell could liquidate his assets was still unclear.\n\nMr Haskell now wants an opportunity to give evidence in court and justify his claims - as well as cross-examine his ex.\n\nGiven the threat of jail hanging over him Mr Haskell, 'natural justice' called for him to have a chance to fully present his case, said the judge.\n\nHe dismissed Mrs Haskell's claim for an immediate judgment summons against her ex, saying the case needed far more time to enable full evidence to be prepared and heard.\n\nBut she now has the option of relaunching it, the court heard.\n\nThe judge said: 'I cannot be more sympathetic to her circumstances,' the judge said, but concluded 'with considerable reluctance I have no choice but to dismiss this judgment summons. She must reissue with a proper time estimate.'\n\nThe case is now likely to return to court for a longer hearing at a later date.", "description": "Preston Haskell IV, 52, married Alesia Vladimirovna in 2008 but the couple split after 10 years.
