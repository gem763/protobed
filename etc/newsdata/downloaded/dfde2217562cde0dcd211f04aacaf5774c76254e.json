Her name is Elizabeth Warren.", "language": "en", "text": "Jodi Stanfield enthusiastically supported Bernie Sanders in 2016. Now, she has found a new candidate who excites her: Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cI trust her when she says she can fight, and also win,\u201d Stanfield said Saturday at a Democratic steak fry where many of the candidates spoke. While Sanders and Warren have similar platforms, the Massachusetts Democrat would be more effective in accomplishing her goals, said the 51-year-old, who works at the YMCA.\n\nStanfield represents a growing problem for the Vermont independent in his second run for president: Warren has begun to eclipse Sanders\u2019s once-dominant standing among the Democratic Party\u2019s most liberal voters and surpass him in some polls in the first two states in the nominating process: Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThey both support what would be a massive economic restructuring with ideas such as Medicare-for-all, but Sanders, 78, has carved out his brand as a democratic socialist while Warren, 70, has described herself as a capitalist who has operated more as part of the Democratic mainstream. While Sanders drew notice in 2016 for his avid fans and big crowds, it is Warren this time who is gaining traction that way.\n\nThese challenges have been compounded by volatility inside Sanders\u2019s operations in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign quietly fired its Iowa political director in the late summer and has yet to name a replacement \u2014 a key vacancy as the race enters a crucial phase, with less than five months to go before the February caucuses.\n\nSanders\u2019s difficulties in Iowa have come into sharper focus over the weekend. The most respected pollster in the state released a survey late Saturday showing Warren surging to 22 percent, two points ahead of former vice president Joe Biden, with Sanders at 11 percent. That places him third in the state where he fought Hillary Clinton to a near draw in 2016, launching an electrifying national movement.\n\n\n\nSen.

(Anthony Lanzilote/Bloomberg)\n\nPerhaps more worrisome for Sanders, the poll provided the clearest indication yet that Warren is eating into his base. She is winning a bigger share of people who caucused for Sanders in 2016 than he is, and she is outpacing him among those under 35, his former strong suit, according to the survey conducted by Selzer and Co. for the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom.\n\n\u201cI give him tremendous credit for changing the conversation,\u201d said Rod Sullivan, a Johnson County supervisor who introduced Sanders at a campaign stop in 2015 and now backs Warren. \u201cWe need to get that kind of stuff done and I think there\u2019s a better way to get it done now. Last time was a binary choice and this time I think there are better messengers.\u201d\n\nSanders campaign officials, dismissing the notion that their candidate is struggling, vowed Sunday to plow ahead with aggressive moves to win the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cUnlike Bernie Sanders, polls are inconsistent and all over the place, including an Iowa poll that came a few days ago,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. \u201cWe feel good about our field operation in the state and our team is working harder and harder each day to urge people to caucus for a once-in-a-lifetime candidate.\u201d\n\nSanders will embark Monday on a \u201cBernie Beats Trump\u201d tour across the state, an effort to argue that he is the most electable choice against President Trump in 2020. But his more immediate obstacle is Warren, whom he has refrained from criticizing, though some of his surrogates have been more aggressive.\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden puts on a Beau Biden Foundation hat while speaking at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, in Des Moines on Saturday. (Nati Harnik/AP)\n\nSanders has sought to stand out from the pack by emphasizing his decades-long advocacy of sweeping ideas like Medicare-for-all, something he did at a Sunday rally in Warren\u2019s childhood hometown of Norman, Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cIt is unique and maybe unique in American history,\u201d Sanders said of his campaign, as he encouraged supporters to join a nationwide grass-roots movement. After they started chanting his name, he replied, \u201cIt ain\u2019t Bernie, it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\nFor loyal followers like C.J. Petersen of Breda, Iowa, Sanders\u2019s consistency merits support at the caucuses. \u201cSenator Warren is fantastic,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cBut Bernie has been on these issues in the very beginning.\u201d\n\nBut for many others, that\u2019s no longer enough. Matt Shockley, a 24-year-old teacher from Oklahoma City who attended the Sanders rally in Norman, said he voted for Sanders in 2016, but now is leaning toward Warren.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very warm as a person and she has her own kind of charisma,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that will really help in the general. And on policy, she and Bernie are so similar, it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much of a trade-off in voting for her over him.\u201d\n\nAs the Sanders campaign tries to hang on to voters like Shockley, employee disputes and staff shake-ups have jolted the Vermont senator\u2019s organization, stretching from important early states to the Washington headquarters, leading to firings, resignations, tense meetings and fierce rivalries, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nIn New Hampshire, where Sanders defeated Clinton by 22 points but is now in close competition with Warren and Biden, Sanders recently changed state directors. The operation had been tumultuous for months, people with knowledge with the situation said.\n\nSome of the internal friction has touched the highest levels of the campaign. A dispute over salaries earlier this year pitted rank-and-file field staff against campaign management. On a conference call the day after a Washington Post report about the standoff, Shakir bluntly warned any leakers to quickly leave the campaign, speaking in a tone that angered some participants, people with knowledge of the call said.\n\nThe Post interviewed 30 present and past Sanders aides, allies and voters for this story. Many who described the tension in the campaign spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nWarren has been building a robust operation in Iowa that many local Democratic strategists said is the most impressive in the field. She has been picking off former Sanders backers, including some of his earliest champions.\n\nThe Sanders campaign brushed aside questions about firing its Iowa political director Jess Mazour in the late summer. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make moves that we feel best position this campaign to win,\u201d Shakir said in a written statement after The Post reached out to the campaign last week. Mazour did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlthough friction and turnover is not uncommon in the high-pressure environment of presidential campaigns, the extent of the discord in the Sanders operation has surprised some Democrats inside and outside the campaign. They say it reflects a departure from Sanders\u2019s 2016 effort.\n\n\u201cAs presidential campaigns go, the 2016 Sanders campaign had less conflict than most,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a lead strategist on that run who abruptly parted ways with the campaign on the eve of Sanders\u2019s entrance into the 2020 race.\n\nSanders campaign officials played down the personnel changes and said his unique platform of demanding revolutionary change will ultimately propel him to victory.\n\n\u201cSenator Sanders is very confident. He is feeling good about the campaign. We believe this race is down to the three people and we have the best ground game,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of Sanders\u2019s national co-chairs.\n\nKhanna was speaking about Warren and Biden, who along with Sanders, have appeared at the top of most recent state and national surveys.\n\nInside the Sanders campaign in New Hampshire, there were issues at the top levels of the campaign from its earliest days. State director Joe Caiazzo and senior strategist Kurt Ehrenberg, two veterans of the 2016 campaign, were in constant conflict, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe workplace situation became so strained earlier this year that a human resources official had to intervene, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nCaiazzo and Ehrenberg declined to comment for this story. Caiazzo was recently reassigned to run the Sanders campaign in Massachusetts and Ehrenberg is no longer with the campaign.\n\nShakir said the personnel decisions were of no concern. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a great team in New Hampshire and are in a really strong position there,\u201d Shakir said in a statement explaining the moves.\n\nYet for some Sanders supporters, the New Hampshire Democratic convention earlier this month served as a sobering moment. In a state where Sanders won just over 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 primary, he was no longer the top draw.\n\nSanders took the stage in Manchester to a rousing ovation, to as many full chairs as anyone then had earned, and to a room of waving signs bearing his name. It was louder than the reception greeting for anyone else \u2014 until Warren took the stage to a two-minute ovation not long after.\n\nJanes reported from Norman, Oklahoma.", "description": "In 2016 the Vermont senator basked in big crowds and liberal popularity \u2014 and in both elements he\u2019s now being eclipsed by Warren.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter", "Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B3r-1EMXnQC1LXCzDoea6x9_ySI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJ64UXW5QMI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
