He said the company's long-term investment philosophy and approach remain unchanged: to find growth opportunities for clients based on active, bottom-up research.\n\nContact the writers at jingshuiyu@chinadaily.com.cn", "description": "The preliminary agreement reached between China and the United States in the latest trade consultations is \"encouraging\" and will pave the way for both sides to end the long-running dispute, experts and business leaders said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/14/5da488e2a310cf3e97a12da7.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
