Only it turns out that \u201csecure\u201d is a relative term, as the phone will unlock even if your eyes are closed. Google has given us a statement promising that it will issue a software update that will fix that problem up, but unfortunately the timeline for it is longer than users might like. Google says that \u201cit has \u201cbeen working on an option for users to require their eyes to be open to unlock the phone, which will be delivered in a software update in the coming months.\u201d\n\nThe Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock feature is very similar to the iPhone\u2019s system, utilizing infrared projectors and cameras to create and read an accurate depth map of your face. That makes it more secure than other RGB camera based solutions \u2014 it can\u2019t be tricked with a photo or a video on a flat screen.\n\nHowever, Apple\u2019s FaceID system does require attention \u2014 in the form of your eyes being open and looking at the screen. Users can disable that feature if they like.\n\nGoogle had previously said that \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything specific to announce regarding future features or timing, but like most of our products, this feature is designed to get better over time with future software updates.\u201d It looks like it\u2019s now willing to commit to delivering them.\n\nThere have been leaks of a \u201cRequire eyes to be open\u201d toggle on the Pixel 4\u2019s face unlock settings, but the toggle isn\u2019t there on the phones that Google showed at its event nor will it be present on shipping phones this week.\n\nGoogle emphasizes in its statement that despite the fact that it works with your eyes closed, it believes that \u201cPixel 4 face unlock meets the security requirements as a strong biometric, and can be used for payments and app authentication, including banking apps. It is resilient against invalid unlock attempts via other means, like with masks.\u201d\n\nThe Pixel 4 is able to tell if you\u2019re looking at it in other contexts. It has a \u201cScreen attention\u201d feature that keeps the screen from turning off if you are looking at it. Now Google needs to make it work for unlocking the phone, as well.\n\nUnfortunately for Google, this isn\u2019t the first piece of drama for its face unlock feature. Ahead of its release, Google was forced to admit that contractors it had hired to gather data to improve face unlock on a wide diversity of faces had targeted homeless people. Google suspended the program to investigate.\n\nFor people who buy the Pixel 4, Google is again pointing out that \u201cif any Pixel 4 users are concerned that someone may take their phone and try to unlock it while their eyes are closed, they can activate a security feature that requires a pin, pattern or password for the next unlock.\u201d That feature is the \u201clockdown\u201d option that appears when you long-press the power button.\n\nHere\u2019s Google\u2019s statement in full:", "description": "Google has given us a statement promising that it will issue a software update that will fix that problem up, but unfortunately the timeline for it is longer than users might like.
