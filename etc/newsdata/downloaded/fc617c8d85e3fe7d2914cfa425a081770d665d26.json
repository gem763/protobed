It marked a first for any Brexit agreement, and happened without the DUP's support.\n\n- Conflicting loyalties -\n\nSome feel the party's pro-Brexit stance puts it at odds with its unionist traditions -- and could ultimately be its undoing.\n\nUnless the sides come up with a different solution, Brexit will require some form of checks at British borders when the country leaves the EU's single market and customs union.\n\nAll sides agree these cannot be done along the Irish border, which was rendered \"invisible\" under a 1998 peace accord that end three decades of bombings and bloodshed known as \"The Troubles\".\n\nThe long-running conflict pitted the Catholic IRA, supporting a united Ireland, against Protestant 'loyalist' groups who favoured remaining in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Brexit deal championed by Johnson would require administrative checks along the Irish Sea, a solution the DUP says would split the UK.\n\n\"The party is right to claim that the new deal will, over time, loosen Northern Ireland's place within the union,\" commentator Fintan O'Toole wrote in the Irish Times last week.", "description": "Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has been at the heart of Britain's Brexit saga, and its annual conference Saturday will see it try to maintain its prominent role.
