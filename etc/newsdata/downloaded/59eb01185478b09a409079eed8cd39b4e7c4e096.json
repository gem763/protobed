When, in late August 2017, they told their parents about being a trans woman and about naming themself Hannah, they weren\u2019t kicked out of the house. Their mother helped Salem find a therapist \u2014 Tate. And their father helped them paint their bedroom in light blue, white and pink stripes, the colors of the trans flag, though he also had counseled Salem not to consider themself transgender until they\u2019d had sex, as if Salem\u2019s first romp with a girl would fix everything.\n\nTheir father got them a job keeping inventory within the chain of auto-repair shops where he worked, advising Salem to use their deadname and hide who they\u2019d become. (About this, and the suggestion that Salem not settle on being trans until they\u2019d lost their virginity, Salem\u2019s father told me alternately that he hadn\u2019t said these things, that he might have implied something about the effect of having sex for the first time and that too much time had passed; I should \u201cwrite whatever Salem remembers,\u201d he said.) Salem lasted through two days of training, anxiety spiking over what might happen if they were found out and depression deepening because they were making themself invisible, concealing Hannah and, beneath that, doubly burying their nonbinary self. \u201cThe salary was a good deal,\u201d Salem said, but on the day they were supposed to turn in their paperwork and join the staff, \u201cI just lay in bed.\u201d They returned to being housebound. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d\n\nSalem had an inkling that there were other places, beyond their hometown, beyond North Carolina, where they might not feel quite so alien and alone. Tate had mentioned Philadelphia, where she\u2019d trained, or Brooklyn. In therapy one day last spring, Salem talked about the main character in \u201cInto the Wild\u201d: a young man, cut off in the Alaskan wilderness, who starves to death because he\u2019s unaware that there\u2019s a spot, a half mile from where he\u2019s wasting away, where he could cross the swollen river that entraps him. On the other side, he could soon get food. \u201cPeople say the dude was an idiot,\u201d Salem said to Tate, \u201cbecause he could have lived if he realized there was a crossing nearby. But I can understand him. To me, he\u2019s relatable.\u201d It was as if Salem both knew and didn\u2019t know that other places existed.\n\nAfter the session, Salem drove northward on the state highway, toward the exit for their town. They passed the turnoff and kept going in the direction of the Virginia line. They\u2019d never done anything like this before. They drove, they told me the next day, with their town behind them, for an hour before they turned around.\n\nWhen I spent more time with them last summer, Salem had just noted their hormone treatment in a chat among players during an online game. Someone let loose with slurs, Salem fired back and another player piped up that she was a trans woman. This was a minor godsend amid the plundering and killing onscreen. Right away, the trans woman, who said she was 19, became Salem\u2019s close friend, at a distance of hundreds of miles. They talked privately online every day and night; Salem listened to her troubles with her father, and she gave Salem the courage to try buying their first bra.\n\nSalem\u2019s breasts had grown. The plan was to buy a sports bra both for exercising and \u201cto compress, because sometimes\u201d \u2014 though the hormones seemed a success on most days \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of my breasts.\u201d Salem drove to Chapel Hill, the most liberal community in the area, and sat paralyzed in a shopping-center parking lot with the trans woman coaching them by phone. At last, they ventured into Target. They scouted the store, angling into the women\u2019s section. They fled without touching an item, searching for a place where they could delay, bypassing electronics because a salesperson was sure to approach, and the last thing Salem wanted, in this state of mortification over bra shopping and over their mix of jeans, Vans, T-shirt, nail polish, mascara and small but noticeable breasts, was to interact with anyone. An aisle of groceries gave refuge. They stared at varieties of pasta. They got their new friend on the phone again and headed back to women\u2019s clothing, figuring that this way it would seem they were shopping for someone else; they plucked two sports bras from a rack and made it through self-checkout.\n\nTo Tate, the friendship was reassuring progress, especially after Salem and the trans woman communicated by live video chat, proving that the friend was who she claimed to be. There was progress, too, in all the colors Salem had begun using on successive fingernails \u2014 greenish-yellow, pink, white, orange, purple, blue.", "description": "Not everyone identifies as male or female.
