Coastal nuclear plants commonly dump water that contains tritium into the ocean. It occurs in minute amounts in nature.\n\nTepco admitted last year that the water in its tanks still contained contaminants beside tritium.\n\nCurrently, more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water is held in almost 1,000 tanks at the Fukushima Daiichi site, but the utility has warned that it will run out of tank space by the summer of 2022.\n\n\u201cThe only option will be to drain it into the sea and dilute it,\u201d Yoshiaki Harada told a news briefing in Tokyo on Tuesday. \u201cThe whole of the government will discuss this, but I would like to offer my simple opinion.\u201d\n\nNo decision on how to dispose of the water will be made until the government has received a report from a panel of experts. Other options include vaporising the liquid or storing it on land for an extended period.\n\nFukushima grapples with toxic soil that no one wants Read more\n\nHarada did not say how much water would need to be discharged into the ocean.\n\nOne recent study by Hiroshi Miyano, who heads a committee studying the decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi at the Atomic Energy Society of Japan, said it could take 17 years to discharge the treated water after it has been diluted to reduce radioactive substances to levels that meet the plant\u2019s safety standards.\n\nAny decision to dispose of the waste water into the sea would anger local fishermen, who have spent the past eight years rebuilding their industry.\n\nNearby South Korea has also voiced concern over the impact it would have on the reputation of its own seafood.\n\nLast month, Seoul summoned a senior Japanese embassy official to explain how Fukushima Daiichi\u2019s waste water would be dealt with.\n\nTies between the north-east Asian nations are already at a low ebb following a compensation dispute over Koreans forced to work in Japanese factories during the second world war.\n\nThe government spent 34.5bn yen (\u00a3260m) to build a frozen underground wall to prevent groundwater reaching the three damaged reactor buildings. The wall, however, has succeeded only in reducing the flow of groundwater from about 500 tonnes a day to about 100 tonnes a day.\n\nJapan has come under renewed pressure to address the contaminated water problem before Tokyo hosts the Olympics and Paralympics next summer.\n\nSix years ago during the city\u2019s bid for the games, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, assured the international community that the situation was \u201cunder control\u201d.", "description": "More than a million tons of contaminated water lies in storage but power company says it will run out of space by 2022", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4159ec06793b5c1df804dfaa73cbbfa5f1b7082/161_322_3267_1962/master/3267.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c38eec5af7f7b9fbab596617360e9c1c", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
