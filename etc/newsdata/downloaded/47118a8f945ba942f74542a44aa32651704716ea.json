He says there\u2019s more to the story.", "language": "en", "text": "This fleeting moment, immortalized in a now-viral clip, prompted many to dub the man \u2014 later identified as Bobby Rankin, a close friend of Cummings \u2014 as their \u201chero\u201d for casting \u201cwell-deserved shade\u201d at McConnell. By early Monday, the 16-second video had been watched nearly 6 million times as a number of people said that they, too, would have passed on shaking McConnell\u2019s hand.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThank you brother for doing what most Americans want to do,\u201d a Twitter user wrote.\n\nWhile many assumed that Rankin had acted out of loyalty to Cummings, the longtime legislator from Maryland who had repeatedly clashed with President Trump before his death on Oct. 17, the 64-year-old from Charlotte told The Washington Post his reasons were much more personal.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw Mitch McConnell, all I saw was my brother\u2019s face,\u201d said Rankin, one of Cummings\u2019s pallbearers.\n\nRankin\u2019s brother, Jerry, died last October from cancer after being exposed to contaminated water while serving in the Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Jerry did not receive the veterans\u2019 benefits he was owed before he died, Rankin said \u2014 and he blamed McConnell in part for that family tragedy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cElijah Cummings reached across party lines trying to help my brother get his military benefits, and Mitch McConnell was one of the persons he reached out to,\u201d Rankin said.\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Rankin\u2019s claims.\n\nRankin said his brother was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer that causes malignant cells to accumulate in a person\u2019s bone marrow, more than a decade ago, after leaving the Marines. Multiple myeloma is one of 15 health conditions linked to Camp Lejeune\u2019s tainted drinking water, which contained industrial solvents, benzene and other chemicals for roughly 30 years beginning in the 1950s, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans who were exposed to the water and later developed any of the conditions can qualify for benefits, including free health care and disability compensation, VA said.\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, Rankin said his brother was already on his mind when he spotted McConnell, noting that Friday marked the anniversary of Jerry\u2019s death. Rankin wasn\u2019t clear about exactly why his brother didn\u2019t receive VA benefits or McConnell\u2019s precise role in Jerry\u2019s battle to get them after his cancer returned in 2016.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI could not put my hands in the man\u2019s hand who refused to help somebody who served his country,\u201d Rankin said, later adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it, because I was thinking about my brother.\u201d\n\nRankin had no idea that the moment, which was captured on live broadcasts of the memorial ceremony, would turn him into an online sensation, sparking the hashtag \u201c#thehandshakethatneverwas.\u201d In the clip, Rankin could be seen engaging with the senators and representatives lined up alongside McConnell, before skipping over the GOP leader.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis might be the best thing I\u2019ve ever watched,\u201d one person tweeted.\n\n#MoscowMitch was today years old when he learned about proper shade https://t.co/sx6vbc5MxC \u2014 Tara Dublin Rockstober (@taradublinrocks) October 25, 2019\n\nKeen-eyed social media users also pointed out that Rankin wasn\u2019t the only person to \u201cshade\u201d McConnell during Thursday\u2019s event. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who was standing next to McConnell, appeared to smirk at the Kentucky Republican after witnessing the failed handshake.\n\nAD\n\nPlease watch this. It's all perfect but Chuck Schumer's expression makes it art. https://t.co/pLei3OTXJP \u2014 Kellie Burke \ud83c\udf00 (@kaburke9) October 24, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Rankin didn\u2019t even see the video until a Washington Post reporter called.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what people are saying,\u201d he said.\n\nRankin\u2019s relationship with Cummings began with a chance meeting at a gas station in Baltimore more than two decades ago. The pair struck up a conversation while pumping gas and by the time their tanks were full, a friendship was born.\n\nAD\n\nThey stayed close as Cummings ascended in politics, garnering national attention for \u201chis principled stands on politically charged issues in the House, his calming effect on anti-police riots in Baltimore, and his forceful opposition to the presidency of Donald Trump,\u201d as The Post\u2019s Jenna Portnoy wrote. In the months before his death on Oct. 17, Cummings and Trump engaged in public spats that included the president calling the congressman\u2019s Baltimore district a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d Cummings, in his position as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, also helped lead the Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\nAD\n\nCummings was buried Friday following a funeral in Baltimore attended by thousands, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As politicians and Cummings\u2019s family members remembered the congressman, Rankin had a private parting message for his friend.\n\n\u201cWhen I carry him to his grave, if I could say something to him, I would say something I said to him many, many times before,\u201d Rankin told The Post. \u201cWhat a mighty, mighty man he is.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Many assumed that Bobby Rankin, a close friend of Cummings, had acted out of loyalty to the late congressman.
