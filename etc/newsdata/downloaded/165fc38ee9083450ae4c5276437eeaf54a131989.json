REUTERS/Danish Ismail\n\nThe official said the attack took place in south Kashmir\u2019s Shopian district, which is a major apple-growing region and a hotbed of militancy that has raged in Indian Kashmir for decades.\n\nThe state police tweeted that two civilians had been killed and a third person injured in Shopian, but did not give details.\n\nThere have been signs that militant actions have picked up in Indian Kashmir in last two months after New Delhi revoked the region\u2019s decades-old autonomy in August.\n\nApple farming provides jobs for some 3.5 million people and is a major part of Indian Kashmir\u2019s economy, which went into a tailspin after New Delhi imposed a lockdown on the region, including cutting phone and internet links.\n\nOver the last two weeks, suspected militants have killed one truck driver and a trader in Shopian.\n\nHowever, trade has shown signs of recovery, as more than 10,000 trucks laden with apples left Indian-ruled Kashmir last week. On an average, about 300-400 apple trucks have been moving out of Shopian alone, over the last 10 days.\n\nIn a separate incident in northern Kashmir, one woman was killed and three other civilians injured on Thursday in cross-border shelling between Indian and Pakistani forces in the disputed Kashmir region, a senior Indian police official said.\n\nIndian and Pakistani troops targeted each others\u2019 security posts in the Tanghdar region in northern Kashmir with heavy artillery firing and mortar on Thursday afternoon, the official said.\n\nTensions between the two countries have flared and there has been intermittent cross-border firing since Aug. 5 when New Delhi flooded Indian Kashmir with troops to quell unrest after it revoked the region\u2019s special autonomous status.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have disputed Kashmir since their independence from Britain in 1947, fighting two of their three wars over the region.", "description": "Suspected militants shot and killed two drivers and set fire to their apple trucks in Indian Kashmir on Thursday, a senior police official said.", "authors": ["Fayaz Bukhari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444579282&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1NP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
