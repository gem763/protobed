The SDF and associated Kurdish administrators have condemned the plan as a form of ethnic cleansing, as the end goal would be a dramatic demographic change for the region.\n\nAfter hours of discussion this week, Islamist Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emerged from a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin with the announcement of an agreement: the Russians would secure Kurdish areas and Turkey agreed to end the invasion if the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) left those areas.\n\nTurkey considers the YPG indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist organization active in southern Turkey. YPG fighters comprise a large percentage of the SDF and did much of the work in annihilating the Islamic State \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria. The SDF expelled ISIS from Raqqa, its \u201ccapital,\u201d in 2018 with U.S. air support.\n\nTurkey has for years stood accused of harboring ISIS terrorists and giving them easy access to the Syrian war theater.\n\n\u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d is a joint operation with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a coalition of mostly Arab fighters created to wage war against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad with significant help from former President Barack Obama. Reports indicate many FSA militants came from the Syrian wing of al-Qaeda, the former Nusra Front (currently Jabhat Fatah al-Sham) and Kurdish fighters have published videos showing jihadists desecrating the corpses of fallen Kurdish fighters.\n\nSDF spokesman Kino Gabriel issued a statement Thursday accusing Turkey of failing to abide by the \u201cpermanent ceasefire.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the commitment of our forces to the cease-fire agreement and their withdrawal from all the cease-fire region, Turkish government with its allied terrorist factions are still violating the cease-fire agreement and still continuing its genocide war against our people and our lands,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cThe terrorist factions with Turkish supporting and backing have waged early this morning a vast ground attack on Almanajir, Alasadyah, and Almusherfah villages which are outside the ceasefire region.\u201d\n\nGabriel added that the SDF will exercise its \u201clegitimate right to self-defense\u201d and urges America \u201cto intervene immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d began immediately after President Donald Trump announced he would withdraw troops from Rojava. The president has congressional authorization only to use military force against al-Qaeda and affiliated groups, as per a 2001 Congressional Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). As ISIS is not present in Rojava, Trump had no legal authority to keep troops there.\n\nWith the FSA\u2019s return, Trump could potentially argue that troops can legally fight against the Turkish forces if proof definitively proves those fighting with Turkish forces are members of an al-Qaeda offshoot.\n\nThe SDF counted three dead \u2013 including a female fighter whose \u201cbody was kidnapped by the mercenaries\u201d \u2013 and four wounded, but managed to kill \u201cat least 31 mercenaries,\u201d by which they mean members of the FSA. There is no evidence that the Kurds have managed to kill any members of the formal Turkish military at press time.\n\nErdogan and Putin spent over two hours locked in a room alone brokering an agreement on Wednesday, and a total of six hours together including meetings with staff, according to the Kremlin. The Russian Defense Ministry announced Friday that it was beginning to move 300 soldiers out of Chechnya, a traditional hotbed of Islamic extremism, and into Syria to help expel the SDF from Rojava as part of the deal to create a \u201csafe zone.\u201d The Russian soldiers would, in theory, ensure that Turkey did not attack Kurdish civilians or engage in any ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed on Thursday, however, that while Erdogan has claimed the military invasion is over, there exists no timetable during which Turkey will withdraw its forces from Syria. The FSA, as it is native to Syria, also has nowhere to withdraw.\n\nRussian has been allied for years with Assad and has spent significant money and human capital on keeping him in power. Erdogan and Assad have an acrimonious relationship, repeatedly referring to each other as \u201cterrorists.\u201d Erdogan has said that the Turkish military would only enter Syria \u201cto end the rule of the tyrant Assad, who terrorizes with state terror,\u201d and \u201cno other reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe talks were very difficult, and don\u2019t forget the fact that the Turkish side has its own goals,\u201d Kremlin spokesman said of the Erdogan-Putin meeting this week. Peskov emphasized that Russia is the only military in Syria with permission from Assad and that it was acting in the interests of Damascus.\n\nThe SDF has traditionally kept out of Assad\u2019s way and vice versa \u2013 the SDF focusing on fighting ISIS and Assad focusing on killing civilians in rebel-held cities. Since the U.S. withdrawal, the SDF has reached out to Damascus to protect from Turkey, however, as it serves the interests of neither side to have a Turkish invasion into the country.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) condemned Turkey and its \"allied terrorist factions\" on Thursday for \"continuing its genocide war.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/turkish-forces-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
