Become a member to get it in your inbox on Sunday.\n\nShe may be having a hard time with the media in Britain, but the crowd at the U.S. Open made Meghan Markle feel right at home, cheering her loudly as her face appeared on the jumbotron on Saturday afternoon.\n\nMeghan attended the U.S. Open to watch her friend, sporting icon Serena Williams, make what turned out to be an unsuccessful tilt at a record-breaking 24th grand slam. Meghan sat in Williams\u2019 players\u2019 box with Serena\u2019s husband Alexis Ohanian, Oracene Price, Williams\u2019 mother, Venus Williams, Serena\u2019s sister, Patrick Mouratoglou, Williams\u2019 coach, and Vogue editor-in-chief (and huge tennis fan) Anna Wintour.\n\nThe Queen May Give Meghan Markle a PR Pep Talk For Her Birthday\n\nThe tennis game came after the excitement of Meghan being seen among New Yorkers; she rose early to attend a reportedly favorite West Village yoga class of hers, according to People magazine.\n\n\u201cThere were lots of sweet, knowing smiles\u201d among a class of around 60 Modo Yoga patrons when Meghan appeared on Saturday morning, a source told People.\n\n\u201cShe has been going to Modo Yoga for many years and tries to do so whenever she is in New York,\u201d the source told the publication. \u201cIt was the perfect remedy for jet lag.\u201d At the time of writing, no pictures of Meghan attending the class had leaked to the press.\n\nNew York Fashion Week watchers wonder if Meghan will take in a show or two before her flight back to Britain, which is reportedly some time on Sunday.\n\nAt Flushing Meadows, while most of us saw a strong woman supporting a buddy, and bringing a welcome splash of glamour to one of America\u2019s most storied sporting occasions, for British tabloid the Daily Mail, it was another chance to mock, criticize and attempt to shame Meghan.\n\nThis time, the writer Sarah Vine used the solo trip to accuse her of being a bad mother for having had the temerity to leave her four-month-old son Archie at home with Harry.\n\nVine, in a piece of writing dripping with venom, compared Meghan to herself, saying that she could never have left her child for a few days at such a young age because she \u201cwas still breastfeeding,\u201d because it would have been \u201ca huge emotional wrench,\u201d because she was \u201ccompletely obsessed with my baby\u201d and because she was \u201cexhausted.\u201d\n\nVine\u2019s clear inference was that Meghan\u2019s wish to take a quick trip back to the country of her birth to support one of her most inspirational and valued friends showed Meghan was none of these things, and therefore a terrible mother.\n\nShe called the appearance a \u201cstunt\u201d and said that Meghan\u2019s willingness to fly to the U.S. to watch a tennis match showed she was a climate hypocrite (yawn), given to \u201cflaunting\u201d her famous friendships.\n\nFor good measure, she sought to further suggest that Meghan had offended the queen by going to watch tennis because she and Harry have not gone to the queen\u2019s Scottish residence, Balmoral this year.\n\nFor Vine this tirade would usually have been pretty standard another-day-another-dollar-invective.\n\nHowever, unfortunately for Vine, the internet quickly realized she is in no position to be preaching to anyone about parenting skills: In 2016, it was reported she had left her 11-year-old son alone in a hotel room for six hours while she and her husband (the senior Conservative politician Michael Gove) had a raucous night out.\n\nThe child, according to reports, was left alone in a bed and breakfast for six hours while Vine and Gove attended an event hosted to mark the end of the Cheltenham Literary Festival\u2014and their then 11-year-old child was subsequently found wandering the hotel corridors by a night porter at 1.30 a.m., asking where his parents were.\n\nVine\u2019s accusations of hypocrisy against Meghan also seem to be asking for trouble; most people would agree that traveling on an airplane shouldn\u2019t disbar anyone from being concerned about the environment.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a tame form of hypocrisy when compared to her husband, who was recently forced to admit that he wrote a column for The Times of London (before he was a politician he was a journalist) condemning drug use, and just hours after he hosted a cocaine-fueled party at his apartment.", "description": "Don Emmert/AFP/GettyIf you love The Daily Beast\u2019s royal coverage, then we hope you\u2019ll enjoy The Royalist, a members-only series for Beast Inside.\u00a0Become a member\u00a0to get it in your inbox on Sunday.She may be having a hard time with the media in Britain, but the crowd at the U.S. Open made Meghan Markle", "authors": ["Tom.Sykes Thedailybeast.Com", "Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sgr4JHJhLt8P.3BOOThtxA--~B/aD01NzU7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/3592c3f7f9fd961cc27bc5a81f96eaea", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
