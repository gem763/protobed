Davis: No facts showing any Hunter Biden wrong doing - only Trump/Giuliani lies and innuendo", "language": "en", "text": "The same media \u2014 the same fact-checkers \u2014 who focus on Donald Trump Donald John TrumpAmash responds to Trump: 'It's not about the transcript of a call' Warren announces expansion of presidential campaign Colbert on Ukraine controversy: 'It might be the thing' that gets Trump MORE and tell him, \u201cfacts matter\u201d have virtually ignored the facts about whether Hunter Biden actually did anything wrong while serving on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nHere is one typical example from a Washington Post page one story on Saturday morning by Matt Viser \u2014 with the headline, \u201cScrutiny over Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal may also complicate Biden\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Biden first entered the presidential race, it triggered a burst of attention on Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business ties.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIs \u201cforeign business ties\u201d a fact that, used in this context, implies even slightly possible wrongdoing? Of course not. Indeed, I couldn\u2019t find a single fact in the Post story about anything improper by Hunter Biden due to his service on the Burisma board, much less anything criminal. Not even an \u201callegation\u201d of such. Did he use his influence or perceived influence, as the son of a U.S. vice president, to obtain contracts for Burisma? Did he break any Ukrainian laws? Any U.S. laws? No facts even suggesting such.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not fair to single out just The Washington Post. I would ask the same question of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNN and mainstream cable news and other mainstream media after the Trump telephone call story broke. Count the number of words mentioning the name Hunter Biden and look for any facts suggesting any wrongdoing. I don\u2019t think you will find any.\n\nOne problem with all mainstream media today is the pressure to be \u201cfirst\u201d online or on cable TV. This is one reason we see so often what the award-winning journalist Kurt Eichenwald frequently called \u201cweasel words\u201d \u2014 words like, \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cpossible.\u201d \u201cOur JOB [as journalists] is to communicate what we know \u2014 not what we \u2018might\u2019 know,\u201d Eichenwald wrote in a June 2018 Tweet.

Davis: No facts showing any Hunter Biden wrong doing - only Trump/Giuliani lies and innuendo Nadler's House committee holds a faux hearing in search of a false crime MORE found no crimes were committed).\n\nTo be fair, many of today\u2019s political journalists often blur the lines between fact-reporting vs. interpretive reporting, since so many also appear as political pundits on cable TV. They feel much freer, even written in a page one \u201cnews\u201d stories, to use hypothetical words like \u201cmay\u201d or \u201ccould\u201d and \u201cbad optics,\u201d rather than sticking to fact-reporting. At the very least, it would be worth going back to the old tradition of labeling such non-fact stories as \u201cnews and analysis,\u201d or write an op-ed, rather than seeming to be a \u201cnews\u201d story.\n\nSo, what should Hunter Biden do to combat this innuendo journalism that is not only hurting his father\u2019s presidential campaign but, in my judgment, unfairly harms his personal reputation? I wrote a book a long time ago, with the subtitle of the book the summary of my crisis management strategic mantra:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTell it early, tell it all, tell it yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u201d means the truth. That might be wise for Hunter Biden to do soon.\n\nI strongly suspect that, in fact, Hunter Biden did nothing wrong, improper or illegal at all. But someone should be getting all the facts together, from beginning to end, as to what he actually did while he served on the board for Burisma.\n\nI don\u2019t care if he was paid a lot because he was the vice president\u2019s son. I don\u2019t care if he was given the board seat on Burisma because of the perception that he could deliver contracts or access or special favors as a result of his being the son of a vice president of the United States. I even don\u2019t care whether as a board member Biden helped procure Burisma legitimately won and deserved contracts. That\u2019s what board members are supposed to do. So long as he didn\u2019t use his dad\u2019s influence to get them.\n\nAll I want to know are the facts and whether they show any possible wrongdoing. I strongly suspect that when the facts are reported, there will be nothing there. Nothing other than the wild, unhinged and reckless imaginations and innuendo of Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiSenate Democrats hesitant to go all-in on impeachment probe Trump defiant in face of impeachment inquiry Democratic senators request probe into whistleblower complaint MORE and his client, Donald Trump, who we all know don\u2019t care about facts and don\u2019t mind lying, nor knowing that we all know they are lying.\n\nDavis served as special counsel to former President Clinton (1996-98) and was a member of President George W.
