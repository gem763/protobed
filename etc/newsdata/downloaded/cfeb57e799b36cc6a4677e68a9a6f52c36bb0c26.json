But even he still struggles.\n\nIn the only broadcast interview ahead of the release of his concert film \"Western Stars,\" which he co-directed and stars in, Springsteen sat down with \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King for a wide-ranging conversation about the movie, his marriage and his career.\n\n\"I think, after all the years of reflection and struggle that you have, I think people would be surprised that you sit here today and you still find it a struggle still,\" King said.\n\n\"Yeah, but that never stops,\" Springsteen replied. \"That's life, you know? Life \u2014 it's that way 'til you go into the box. I don't think it's supposed to stop, you know? You're constantly in the midst of examining your life and learning new things and hopefully getting better at it.\"\n\nGayle King and Bruce Springsteen Lazarus Baptiste\n\nSpringsteen transformed a more than 100-year-old barn into a concert hall \u2014 complete with a 30-piece orchestra for \"Western Stars\" which features his first collection of new music since 2012 and serves as a companion to his album by the same name. Even after all his years in the industry, Springsteen said he still finds performing \"very centering.\"\n\n\"The act of performing is very centering, you know? It's psychologically centering. And when you come off, you've had some experience that contextualizes your life, why you're here, what you do, who you love, how you love and approach your work. I'm lucky in that I work with my friends alongside of me.\"\n\nEven Bruce Springsteen still struggles\n\n\"There is no other job in the world where the same people you worked with at 18 \u2014 at 16, in some cases \u2014 you are working with when you're 70. There's no other line of work that I can think of where that holds true ... that's a pretty nice experience, you know? It's something that there's nothing else quite like it. It's very blessed.\"\n\n\"Western Stars\" premieres in theaters this Friday.", "description": "In his only broadcast interview ahead of the release of his new film, Springsteen sits down with Gayle King for a frank conversation about life, marriage and his career", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/23/ad707efd-b180-4069-9baa-ecc05f13eb9e/thumbnail/1200x630g6/aa4dc8fd9ce06bd88c3990b82e1d8210/dsc2332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
