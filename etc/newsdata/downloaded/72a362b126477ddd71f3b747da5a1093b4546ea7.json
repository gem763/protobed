Personal consumption expenditures remain strong at 4.3%. Private investment tumbled 5.5% due to challenges in global growth and tariffs.\n\nI saw a trend in private investment from 2015-2016, where private investment fell into a \"recession,\" possibly due to oil prices. However, the overall economy did not contract due to strong consumers. My thesis is that what's yet to come will heavily depend on consumers.\n\nSee my in-depth segment, where I shared my letter to the Business Roundtable.\n\nThe United States of America-China Chamber of Commerce (USCCC) branch shows cracks in the notion American businesses can\u2019t or won\u2019t move supply chains. Moreover, only 30% say they are in China to make stuff to export to the United States. That\u2019s great news and should be articulated, as the public demands more accountability.\n\nIf you have relocated or are considering relocating China-based manufacturing facilities to other\n\ncountries because of the tariffs, where have you located, or where are you relocating to (check all that apply)?\n\nOptions Responses Percentage No plans to relocate 144 60.3% Southeast Asia 59 24.7% Mexico 25 10.5% Indian Subcontinent 20 8.4% United States 14 5.9%\n\nWhat specific outcome of any trade deal is the most important to your company?\n\nOptions Responses Percentage Return to status quo 102 42.7% Equal enforcement of Chinese regulations for foreigners 35 14.6% Increased market access 29 12.1% Improve IPR protection 24 10.0% End Chinese industrial policies 17 7.1% Purchase more U.S. goods by China 7 2.9%\n\nWhat is your primary strategy in China?\n\nOptions Responses Percentage Produce goods or services for China market 103 43.1% Produce goods or services for U.S. market 30 12.6% Produce goods or services for markets other than China and the U.S. 22 9.2%\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nWhat the Heck?\n\nDuring the last several weeks the market has seen brutal volatility that has left many investors shaken, although the market\u2019s resolve seems to underscore most are hanging in there.\n\nThis morning equity futures have improbably been trending higher. The two biggest down sessions over the last four weeks were triggered by events that were supposed to spell doom.\n\nDate Event Dow Jones August 5, 2019 Yuan moves below 7 to one dollar -768 points August 14, 2019 Two and ten yields invert -800 points\n\nThis morning the market seems to be yawning instead of panicking which leads me to ask what the heck is going on.\n\nThe two- and ten-year yield have been inverted all morning.\n\nTwo year 1.537%\n\nTen Year 1.515%\n\nThe Yuan continues to get weaker against the US Dollar.\n\nYuan 1 = $7.16\n\nIf the market can rally against the tide of events that just hit like atomic bombs, then you know there is a serious pent up demand to own US stocks.", "description": "Yesterday, calmness returned to the market, but it happened on .09/02/2019 3:14:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/a0b1d60e-bd31-42ec-a98f-1a7f7b1e9be5.png"}
