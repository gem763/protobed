Doha is a short-term blip, the IAAF will recover and be stronger in years to come.\u201d\n\nHowever, an expert with extensive knowledge of major events\u2019 bidding and hosting, who spoke on condition of anonymity, warned Coe must not lose his focus when he almost certainly becomes an IOC member next year, adding more responsibility to his already heavy burden.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that it takes a rocket scientist to see that athletics is in very poor shape at the current time,\u201d the expert told AFP.\n\n\u201cI only hope that Lord Coe will accelerate his reform-minded approach to the sport now he has been re-elected.\n\n\u201cThere is a fear he may have his head turned by the wider sports political world and may not have the focus required to drive root and branch reform for a sport that is so clearly in crisis.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018An exceptional sport\u2019 \u2013\n\nBoth, though, believe Coe and the IAAF are right to persist in taking the sport and the hosting of the championships to new territories and not play safe by restricting it to its European base. The next World Championships, however, return to a \u2018safer\u2019 choice in two years\u2019 time, in Eugene, Oregon, the home of the sport in the United States.\n\n\u201cDoes Doha risk undermining the momentum of the London World Championships -\u2013 yes, but they will bounce back with Eugene and, importantly, what events are built over the year,\u201d said Payne, who believes, in a reference to the empty seats on many days in the Qatari capital, future championships hosts should be penalised if they fail to honour promises made in the bid book.\n\nThe source believes the IAAF has a responsibility \u201cto take the sport to new global regions\u201d and could take a leaf out of the book of football\u2019s rulers, FIFA.\n\n\u201cThey (FIFA) ensure that they are involved in every aspect of the promotion and marketing of the event,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFIFA ensure that ticket sales will result in real people turning up to the stadium.\u201d\n\nFor Moroccan athletics legend Hicham El Guerrouj, who still holds the 1500 metres world record he set 21 years ago, the sport has lost its connection with the public.\n\n\u201cWe must do better at attracting people to the sport,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe participate in an exceptional sport, which has more people taking part in it than football.\n\n\u201cWhat is missing is the tools to get people into the stadia.\u201d\n\nBoth Payne and the fellow expert agree that the athletes themselves need to get out and do far more to promote the sport.\n\nThe latter thinks charismatic champions like 400m hurdler Karsten Warholm and 200m star Noah Lyles should be contracted by the IAAF to reach out to the public in schools and town hall style meetings.\n\nPayne largely concurs.\n\n\u201cShould you encourage personalities, of course, but sport is not a reality show,\u201d said the 61-year-old.\n\n\u201cDo you need to take the sport to the people, make it more accessible? Definitely (and) connect with the younger generation in their language, yes.\n\n\u201cAll athletes should be encouraged to step out from the confines of the track to grow their sport.\u201d\n\npi/gj", "description": "Doha (AFP) \u2013 Athletics could have done without the swathes of empty seats in Doha and the four-year ban for high-profile coach Alberto Salazar that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/9864fe_sebastian-coe-may-dismiss-ban-alberto-salazar-poor-crowds-in-doha-but-russian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
