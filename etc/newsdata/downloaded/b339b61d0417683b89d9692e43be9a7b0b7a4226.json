Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 When Andrew Luck walked away from the Indianapolis Colts, he didn't go very far. The recently retired quarterback still has lunch with his former teammates and, on occasion, such as Thursday afternoon, he stops by the practice facility.\n\nLocal promoter Amp Harris posted a photo on social media of he and Luck posing with actor/comedian Mike Epps and the man who replaced him under center, Jacoby Brissett.\n\nIt shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Luck is spending so much time around Indianapolis since announcing his retirement more than six weeks ago. During his farewell news conference, he talked about how he and his wife, Nicole Pechanec, had fallen in love with Indianapolis.\n\n\"My wife and I are so proud when people ask us where we\u2019re from and we say Indianapolis,\" Luck said. \"It\u2019s our home; we\u2019ve made lifelong friends. This has been an incredible place to make a home and grow off the field and ... Riley camps around the state. Going to the hospital. Getting a chance to talk with parents ... reading to kids at schools ... hanging out ... children\u2019s museum, the wonderful things they do there. A big thank you to this city. It\u2019ll always hold a special place in my heart.\"\n\nIt was during that same farewell news conference that Luck also vowed to remain close to his teammates, to give them any support they may need.\n\nAnd he has done just that. Apart from visiting Brissett at the facility, the two also have had lunch together at least once recently, said quarterbacks coach Marcus Brady. Brissett said a couple of weeks ago that he had his predecessor still text one another, with Luck passing along the advice to \"just have fun with it.\"\n\nLuck stays in contact with other teammates, too, including longtime Colts Anthony Castonzo and T.Y. Hilton as well as Eric Ebron.\n\nThe second-year Colts tight end says that when they talk, it's not usually about football.\n\n\"When we text, it\u2019s usually like, \u2018Hey, good game,' or I just see what he\u2019s up to,\" Ebron said recently. \"I try not to talk football. It\u2019s obvious he didn\u2019t want to be around it, so there\u2019s no point in bringing it up.\n\n\"I just think he might have seen something that was bigger than this. But there\u2019s no telling what people go through. I\u2019m not that close with him. There\u2019s no telling what mentally or psychologically he\u2019s feeling. If he\u2019s happy, that\u2019s only thing that really matters. We\u2019re happy if you\u2019re happy. So when I text him, he seems pretty cool. He responds. He doesn\u2019t two-time us (laughs). Like I don\u2019t know you. He\u2019s cool, man. He\u2019ll share some things with you, sometimes a conversation might pop up.\"\n\nHilton said that when the two of them had their heart-to-heart talk, he knew Luck would be at peace with his decision to walk away from football. In their conversations since, nothing has changed.\n\n\"No, he didn\u2019t need football, but he loved the game,\" Hilton said. \"Whatever he did, he loved doing it. He always put his heart into what he was doing.\"", "description": "Retired Indianapolis Colts quarterback still hangs around the team's facilities and talks often with his former teammates.", "authors": ["Jim Ayello", "Published A.M.
