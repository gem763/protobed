Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWhile ABM Industries's 2.0% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNYSE:ABM Historical Dividend Yield, October 16th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 54% of ABM Industries's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Of the free cash flow it generated last year, ABM Industries paid out 28% as dividends, suggesting the dividend is affordable. It's positive to see that ABM Industries's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nIs ABM Industries's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs ABM Industries has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 2.83 times its EBITDA, ABM Industries has a noticeable amount of debt, although if business stays steady, this may not be overly concerning.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 3.85 times its interest expense, ABM Industries's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of ABM Industries's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of ABM Industries's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.52 in 2009, compared to US$0.72 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.3% a year over that time.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) from a dividend investor's perspective...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bKUP02D52miGALohWTzMEw--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/7bf6dc3d3801635070cb48d17bc5f981", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
