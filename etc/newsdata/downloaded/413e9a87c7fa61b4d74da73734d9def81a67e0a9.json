The Stories We Tell About Conquering Death\n\nEnlarge this image Andrew Holt/Getty Images Andrew Holt/Getty Images\n\n\"It is indeed impossible to imagine our own death,\" wrote Sigmund Freud in 1915. \"And whenever we attempt to do so, we can perceive that we are, in fact, still present as spectators.\"\n\n\n\nHumans have always struggled with this puzzle: we know that one day we will die, but imagining that reality feels unthinkable. Even in death we are somehow still there, off to the side, watching. Philosopher Stephen Cave calls this the \"mortality paradox,\" and he says it's a problem we have wrestled with for thousands of years. Fortunately, we have come up with solutions: stories that assure us that death is not what it seems \u2013 that there are ways to live forever.\n\n\n\nCave says that all of these immortality stories can be boiled down to just four narratives, repeated over and over again in different forms. Each one presents a clever plan to cheat mortality, but raises new, unsolvable dilemmas.\n\n\n\nThis week: the problem of death, and the paths to escape it.\n\nHidden Brain is hosted by Shankar Vedantam and produced by Jennifer Schmidt, Rhaina Cohen, Parth Shah, Laura Kwerel and Thomas Lu.

This week, we pivot from psychology and politics to religion and history as we explore how people have tried to resolve these fears.
