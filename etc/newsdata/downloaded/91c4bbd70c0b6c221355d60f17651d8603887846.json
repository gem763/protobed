(Omar Sobhani/Reuters)\n\nA blast targeting a campaign rally held by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday killed 24 but left the country\u2019s leader unharmed, according to a local health official.\n\nThousands of Afghans packed an open airfield in a police training compound in the country\u2019s northern Parwan province to hear Ghani speak Tuesday morning. Qasim Sangin, head of the Parwan province health department said there were 32 wounded and women and children were among the dead.\n\nThe blast occurred just moments after Ghani arrived at the venue, and even though the explosion was audible, the campaign event continued undeterred. Ghani delivered a boilerplate stump speech praising local leadership to the crowd.\n\nWahida Shahkar, the spokeswoman for the provincial governor in Parwan said the blast targeting the campaign rally was carried out by a suicide bomber driving a motorcycle.\n\nPresidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled for the end of the month after the failure of peace talks with the militant Taliban group.\n\nGhani has held a series of large campaign rallies across the country in recent weeks without incident as he makes his bid for a second term. Tuesday\u2019s rally, as with others, was held amid tight security with all attendees subjected to multiple searches.\n\n[With U.S.-Taliban peace talks canceled, Afghan president is on the hot seat]\n\nAlso Tuesday a blast occurred outside the compound housing the United States Embassy in Kabul, according to a Ministry of Interior statement that did not include information regarding casualties.\n\nGhani\u2019s government has emphasized security as Afghans prepare to head to the polls later this month. Some 72,000 security forces have been deployed to protect the vote and more than two thousand polling stations will be closed on election day due to inadequate security.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for either attack. The Taliban has openly threatened to derail the election process.\n\nGeorge reported from Kabul.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump says Afghanistan talks are dead \u2018as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2019\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s failed Afghanistan gambit, violence and uncertainty remains\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Presidential elections are set for the end of the month despite the failure of peace talks with the Taliban.", "authors": ["Pamela Constable", "Foreign Correspondent Covering Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "South Asia", "Latin America", "Susannah George", "Foreign Reporter Covering Afghanistan", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/exILgZiJTNwur1bxEd0VDLN9osg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKCN43GZF4I6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
