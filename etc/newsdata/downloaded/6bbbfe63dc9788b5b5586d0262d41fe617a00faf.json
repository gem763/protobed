But if you and your spouse are on different health plans \u2014 about 11% of companies do not allow spousal enrollment if they have other coverage \u2014 it may cause issues with your FSA and HSA options. That's because, under the current law, if your spouse or partner has a health FSA through their employer, you'll face a tax penalty if you contribute to an HSA. A new bipartisan bill aims to change that. On Friday, Reps Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Mike Kelly (R-Penn.) introduced the Health Savings for Families Act. The bills would allow families to utilize both HSA and FSA accounts without any tax consequences. \"Cost of care is at a record high and my bill will give families more flexibility to save money on their health care,\" Wexton said in a statement. \"Instead of penalizing families for responsibly managing their money \u2014 as the existing law does \u2014 my bill allows couples to save and spend in the way that's easiest and most affordable for them.\"\n\nThe difference between HSAs and FSAs\n\nBoth HSAs and health FSAs give you the option of putting money directly from your paycheck, tax-free, into an account to be used to pay for medical-related expenses throughout the year. That includes qualified expenses such as medications, over-the-counter drugs, first-aid supplies and dental services, as well as eyeglasses and contacts. Health savings accounts are the most flexible option, but are only available to those with a high-deductible health plan, which for 2019 is a plan with a minimum deductible of $1,350 for an individual and $2,700 for a family. You can contribute up to $3,500 per year for self coverage and up to $7,000 for family coverage, and those funds will roll over, year after year, if you don't spend them.\n\nThis bill would fix a flaw and ensure that families are not penalized for investing in their care. Everyone deserves access to quality, affordable health care \u2014 period. Earl Blumenauer Congressman\n\nA health flexible savings account is a little different. These savings accounts are offered through employer benefits programs and any money you put in this account operates under a \"use it or lose it\" approach. You're supposed to spend what you put in within the calendar year, although some employers allow you to spend the money through March of the next year or even carry forward up to $500. If you don't spend your FSA funds, you might have to surrender the cash. Usually employers keep any unused funds and use the money to cover costs associated with the administration of the FSA program. For 2019, individuals can save up to $2,700 in these accounts.\n\nWhy lawmakers say change is needed", "description": "On Friday, House lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill that would allow families to contribute to both health flexible savings accounts and health savings accounts.", "authors": ["Megan Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106156032-1569858917895gettyimages-463247389.jpeg?v=1569858935", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
