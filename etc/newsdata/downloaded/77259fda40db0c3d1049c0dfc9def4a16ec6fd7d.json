Maybe there are some. I can\u2019t think of one,\u201d he said on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the hate and the division and the cruelty that\u2019s now common \u2014 it wasn\u2019t common ten years ago. Twitter\u2019s a huge part of that,\u201d continued Mr. Carlson. \u201cThey made a small number of people really rich. They should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nTwitter did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nMr. Carlson made the remark while interviewing Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican, about a $250 million defamation lawsuit the congressman has filed against Twitter and the users behind three parody accounts that mocked him online. A Virginia judge ruled last week that the lawsuit can move forward despite objections raised by Twitter and a Republican strategist who operated one of the accounts.\n\nCritics of Mr. Carlson have accused him of spouting hate speech on his cable program in the past, and companies have previously pulled ads from the show as a result of his remarks.\n\nDozens of advertisers boycotted \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d amid an outcry caused by him saying late last year that immigrants make America \u201cpoorer and dirtier and more divided,\u201d and others followed suit after audio emerged in March of controversial comments he made about women and rape.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Republican, accused Mr. Carlson\u2019s advertisers of \u201cunderwriting hate speech\u201d after he said during a July broadcast that the congresswoman, a former Somali refugee and naturalized U.S. citizen, is proof of how \u201cdangerous\u201d immigration has become.\n\n\u201cFox News is now giving a nightly platform to white supremacist rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Omar reacted at the time.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Carlson came under fire after calling white supremacy \u201ca hoax\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d during an August broadcast. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security subsequently added white supremacy to its list of priority threats in a counterterrorism strategy released the following month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
