(Oh, hello, Jordan Peele, Elizabeth Banks, Ed Norton.) Now comes word of two more: Courteney Cox and David Beckham. The Friends alum and soccer legend (we\u2019ll let you figure out which is which) will appear together in an episode of ABC\u2019s hit family comedy that is slated to air in early 2020.\n\nWhat\u2019s more: They\u2019ll both be in hot water \u2014 rather literally, as you can see above in Cox\u2019s Instagram post, which hinted at the news and also includes a photo of series stars Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet joining in on the hot tub high jinks.\n\nBut EW has a few additional details on these guest spots. Cox and Beckham will be seen playing themselves as they compete together in a celebrity bowling tournament. However, the good times take a turn for the worse when they wind up entangled in family drama that involves \u201c\u201980s aerobics classes, a terrifying pool slide, and three side-by-side hot tubs.\u201d\n\nModern Family airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on ABC.\n\nRelated content:", "description": "Friends alum Courteney Cox to guest star on Modern Family", "authors": ["Dan Snierson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mo6xZbVAs16q50Jqnspc7Q--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/dc52e63a966d1d341e51a22f24bd570d", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
