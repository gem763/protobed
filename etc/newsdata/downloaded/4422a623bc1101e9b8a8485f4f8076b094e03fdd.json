His entire campaign is based on the premise that his deep experience and pragmatic politics promises to dispatch the aberration that is Trump and return us to normalcy. If Pence had already returned America to normalcy, that would leave Biden without his main argument.\n\nNo longer would the president be a bombastic demagogue who slathered crude economic populism, vicious anti-immigrant sentiment and creepy affection to the world\u2019s worst dictators on top of the standard Republican mix of tax cuts, social conservatism and Federalist Society-approved judges. Instead, if Pence reverted to past form, we would have a conventional Republican. The Pence of old worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin was dropping \u201ca new Iron Curtain \u2026 down the spine of Europe.\u201d He was a reliable vote for free-trade deals. He even once tried to hammer out an immigration reform compromise that would include a guest worker program. If Pence ended Trump\u2019s anxiety-inducing, market-rattling behavior on the world stage, swing voters in the general election might look past his retrograde views on social issues and breathe a collective sigh of relief.\n\nAlso keep in mind that if Pence were president, it would be because enough Republican voters finally had enough, and gave Republican senators the latitude to oust Trump on a bipartisan vote. We wouldn\u2019t be the same polarized country we are right now.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bill Scher", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
