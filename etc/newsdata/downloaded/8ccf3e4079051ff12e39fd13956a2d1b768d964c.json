Nadine and Derick Hougaard\n\nAccording to an article published in the 28 March edition of Huisgenoot, Afrikaans singer N\u00e1dine walked in on her boyfriend Derick Hougaard in bed with another woman in a hotel room in Pretoria on 16 March.\n\nHe maintained that he did not cheat on N\u00e1dine, but admitted that he was heavily under the influence and couldn't remember much from that night.\n\nThe pair briefly separated following the incident but rekindled their romance shortly after that.\n\n2. Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha\n\nIn March 2019, video footage of a man, who appeared to be musician Mampintsha, assaulting a woman, who appeared to be Babes Wodumo, surfaced online.\n\nThe clip in question was filmed and broadcast on Babes' Instagram Live.\n\nThe Simelane family confirmed that the matter had been formally reported at the Westville police department, during a televised press briefing.\n\nIn June assault charges against Mampintsha was withdrawn after he and Babes completed mediation sessions.\n\nDespite the massive public outcry, the pair quickly mended their romantic relationship, and collaborated on a song.\n\n3. Nomuzi Mabena\n\nIn January, TV personality Moozlie faced severe backlash after a viral video of her being involved in a fake car crash was confirmed to be part of a drunk driving awareness campaign.\n\nDespite the public criticism, some users came out to support the campaign, saying that the execution was impactful and thought-provoking.\n\n\"It was worth all the risk in the world,\" Drive Dry responded after the PR stunt topped Twitter trends.\n\n4. Black Coffee\n\nInternationally acclaimed DJ Black Coffee found himself on the wrong side of Twitter in July, after tweeps accused him of allegedly \"cheating\" on his wife Enhle Mbali with David Guetta's ex-wife, Cathy Guetta.\n\nThis was not the first time Black Coffee had been accused of cheating on his wife of nine years.\n\nNeither Black Coffee or Enhle ever directly addressed the reports that they had gone their separate ways.\n\n5. Rachel Kolisi\n\nRachel Kolisi, the wife to South African Springbok captain Siya Kolisi, was once again getting heat from social media users after calling out a woman who she alleged sent her husband revealing pictures on Instagram.\n\nBoth Rachel and Siya remained tight-lipped following the online drama, with Rachel deleting her Instagram account all-together.\n\nNo public apology was ever offered, despite the woman in question saying she had not ruled out legal action - at the time.\n\nAfter the heat died down, Rachel made a low-key return to social media.\n\nCompiled by Graye Morkel", "description": "From cheating scandals to a PR stunt gone terribly wrong,  2019 has had no shortage of celebrity drama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7057/fa0a68da53de4e11abc11066b02bbc83.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
