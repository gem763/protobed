I would order the biggest dinner you\u2019ve ever seen and take one bite and start shaking, crying and saying I can\u2019t eat this anymore,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI felt like wasn\u2019t in control of the rest of my life - I was convinced I was going to get sacked, so food was my control thing,\u201d she continued.\n\nAmy said she began to restrict her diet after being dumped, but ITV executives intervened to ensure she ate properly.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\u201cI lost a stone in my first six months in BA and when Curtis finished with me I wasn\u2019t hungry and wanted to control my [diet] again but ITV stepped in and made me eat as the psyche was watching me all the time,\u201d she said.\n\nAmy recalls that at her lowest point, she would lay in bed in tears, being comforted by an ITV welfare officer.\n\n\u201cThe welfare girl came in every single lunchtime apart from one day a week to check how much water we were having, how much we\u2019d eaten and how we were,\u201d she explained.\n\n(Image: S Meddle/ITV/REX)\n\n\u201cAnd when it all went tits up for me and I was lying in bed crying at lunchtime, she would get into bed with me and just stroke my head and talk to me and now I speak to her on the phone twice a week to check how I am,\u201d she continued.\n\nRead Amy\u2019s full interview in this week\u2019s issue of heat on newsstands now.\n\n* Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
