And you know what, they did!\" Coleen wrote in her statement.\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account / individual it\u2019s come from. I have saved and screens hotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It\u2019s......... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\"\n\nHowever, pregnant Becky has hit back, denying she was the source of the fake stories and claiming other people had access to her Instagram.\n\n\"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this,\" she wrote back to Coleen on Twitter .\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\"I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"", "description": "How Coleen Rooney, who accused Rebekah Vardy of selling stories on her private life, planted the seeds for revenge in what's been dubbed the Wagatha Christie affair", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Pa", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543687.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Coleen-Rooney-wife-of-Englands-forward.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
