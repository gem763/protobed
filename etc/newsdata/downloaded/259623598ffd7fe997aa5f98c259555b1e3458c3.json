Multiple apps in the App Store offered female cycle tracking before Apple added the same feature to its own health tracking app this fall, for example.\n\nSpotify has been pressing for antitrust action against Apple for several years.\n\nIts representatives have met with Justice Department officials, as well as members of the FTC's Technology Task Force, a group of some 17 attorneys that was set up in February to focus on online platforms and other Internet competition issues, according to one source.\n\nApp developers also complain that Apple's Siri, which responds to verbal commands and can control Apple's own apps, has long had limited functionality with the vast majority of non-Apple apps, including Spotify.\n\nApple announced an update to its software in June that would allow Siri to access Spotify and other music services.\n\nBeyond Spotify, the congressional probe has tapped many companies for details on the four big tech firms.\n\nIn addition to the Judiciary Committee probe, the big tech companies face a plethora of other antitrust investigations.\n\nThe Justice Department is probing Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Apple while the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ). Groups of state attorneys general have also been formed to probe Google and Facebook.\n\nSpotify has complained also about the 30 percent fee that Apple charges outside app developers who sell so-called digital goods such as music or e-books on the App Store, using Apple's in-app billing system. Apple bars app makers for collecting payment any other way on the App Store or showing users links or buttons to other ways to pay.\n\nAt one point, Apple told Spotify to stop sending emails to users who had just signed up for a free version of its streaming music prompting them to upgrade to the paid service, Spotify has said. Spotify has said the shifting rules, and Apple's threats to block routine app updates, have made it difficult to compete with Apple's own music service on a level playing field.\n\nAsked for comment, Apple referred to its previous responses, published in March, to Spotify's claims. The company says it enforces its App Store rules evenly among all developers and that more than eight out of every 10 apps are free and pay nothing to Apple. Apple has said Spotify pays nothing for users of its free service or for paid Spotify members who signed up outside the App Store.\n\nApple has said Spotify pays a revenue share on about half a percent of its 108 million premium users, paying 15% fees on roughly 680,000 customers that Spotify acquired between 2014 and 2016 when it used Apple's payment systems.\n\n\"Even now, only a tiny fraction of their subscriptions fall under Apple\u2019s revenue-sharing model. Spotify is asking for that number to be zero,\" Apple said in response to Spotify's claims it published in March.", "description": "Exclusive: Antitrust probers in Congress ask Spotify to detail alleged Apple abuses - sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF93192_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
