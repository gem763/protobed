REUTERS/Toru Hanai\n\nThe Japanese brewer has bought Italy\u2019s Peroni and Czech market leader Pilsner Urquell, among others, in recent years, as a shrinking population and a growing preference for wine or cocktails weigh on domestic beer sales.\n\nKoji said the company would sit tight on further major acquisitions for the time being, having agreed in July to buy AB InBev\u2019s (ABI.BR) Australian business Carlton & United Breweries for $11 billion, a move that would make it the world\u2019s third-biggest brewer.\n\nPeroni, Poland\u2019s Lech and Hungary\u2019s Dreher are Asahi brands that have launched zero-alcohol beers, competing with European leaders such as Heineken (HEIO.AS) and Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) which are also tapping growing demand for healthier drinks.\n\nKoji said sales of some of the group\u2019s European alcohol-free brands had grown more than 30 percent, albeit from a low base.\n\n\u201cWe want to make non-alcohol beers a revenue pillar,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview. \u201cJapanese technology is being used quite a bit among these non-alcohol beers, to make good products,\u201d he said.\n\nAsahi has been developing ways to improve the taste of its alcohol-free beers and sharing know-how was one of the benefits of its global M&A, in addition to slashing procurement and production costs, he said.\n\nKoji declined to share detailed numbers or targets for the group\u2019s non-alcoholic range. Market leader Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) (ABI.BR) has said low or alcohol-free beer will likely make up around 20 percent of its volume by end-2025.\n\nThe planned purchase of Carlton & United Breweries is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and push Asahi\u2019s net debt to above four times EBITDA.\n\nKoji said Asahi would now focus on improving its finances for the next few years, including bringing the multiple down to around three times, before embarking on further deals.\n\n\u201cUntil our balance sheet normalizes I don\u2019t think we can make major investments,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering our current calculations... that would take until around 2022 to 2023.\u201d", "description": "Asahi Group Holdings' <2502.T> Chief Executive Akiyoshi Koji is betting on alcohol-free beer to drive global profits in coming years, leveraging Japanese technology to improve the taste of the European brands it now owns.", "authors": ["Ritsuko Ando", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444499564&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N14V", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
