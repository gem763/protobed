Of course, none of the eight options achieved a majority.\n\nA second Brexit referendum, commonly referred to as a \"People's Vote,\" and a plan to stay in the EU's customs union both got more votes than May's deal did during its two defeats.\n\nData: Parliamentary Digital Service; Chart: Chris Canipe\n\nWhat's next: The way forward is still unclear, though tomorrow promises high drama. May wanted to bring her deal back for a third vote, but Speaker John Bercow ruled earlier that there would have to be substantial changes to do so.\n\nThe government's Bercow-approved alternative is to separate the deal's two components \u2014 the withdrawal agreement, a legal document setting out the terms of Brexit, and the political declaration, a roadmap for the future EU-U.K. relationship \u2014 and have a vote just on the former tomorrow.\n\nBut that's not a meaningful vote that would officially approve May's deal. That would have to come later \u2014 or require some legally questionable political maneuvering instead, as outlined by The Guardian's Andrew Sparrow. Approving the withdrawal agreement would also lengthen the EU's Brexit extension from April 12 to May 22, giving the U.K. more breathing room to avoid having to take part in European elections on May 23.\n\nSo, as the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg notes, it all comes down to optics: With this vote, May is daring Brexit-supporting MPs across the Commons \u2014 many of whom don't support the terms of her deal \u2014 to vote against a form of Brexit on what was supposed to be Brexit Day.\n\nThe big question: So, uh, when exactly is Brexit going to happen now?\n\nApril 12? Assuming tomorrow's withdrawal agreement vote fails, that remains the exit date.\n\nMay 22? That'd require the withdrawal agreement vote to succeed \u2014 triggering an extra month under the EU's extension \u2014 and assumes May then figures out a way to pass her deal.\n\nNext year? A long-term extension from the EU would require political upheaval, like an early general election, and it would also force the country to participate in European elections.\n\nNever? It would take a series of unforeseen events to get to that point, but it's still a possibility.\n\nGo deeper: The deeply sourced tick-tock \"How the UK lost Brexit battle\" from Politico's Tom McTague highlights how the process' international diplomacy went off the rails in slow motion.", "description": "The way forward is still unclear, though tomorrow promises high drama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/LnKUkg34LcugULl34bZpiV7U0zY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/28/1553808609053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
