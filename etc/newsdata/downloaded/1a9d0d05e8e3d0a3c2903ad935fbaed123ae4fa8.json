The lesions are thought to be caused by decreased blood flow to the brain.\n\nDr Ramos, a neurologist and sleep expert at the University of Miami, said: 'Insomnia, and prolonged sleep duration appear to be linked to a decline in neurocognitive functioning that can precede the onset of Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.\n\n'We observed that prolonged periods of sleep and chronic insomnia symptoms led to declines in memory, executive function and processing speed.\n\n'Those measures can precede the development of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.'\n\nDr Ramos said the findings, published in The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, provide fresh insight into how too much, rather than too little, sleep may be linked to the disease, particularly in Hispanic patients.\n\n'We may also be able to identify at-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention to prevent or reduce the risk of dementia,' he said.\n\nPrevious studies have shown Alzheimer's is more prevalent in black and Hispanic people, although the reason why is unclear.", "description": "The team of academics from the University of Miami Miller School looked at 5,247 Hispanics over seven years.
