Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for HUG\n\nJames Middleton, whom you may know as Kate Middleton\u2019s brother, and whom you may also know as a guy who had some sort of marshmallow company at one point, and whom you also-also may know as a hot guy from Instagram who has a bunch of dogs, brought a very sweet little plus-one to the GQ Men of the Year Awards in London on Tuesday. It was, indeed, a dog \u2014 his therapy cocker spaniel, Ella.\n\nOh, she is a very good girl. As you can see, Ella was dressed in a tartan \u201cPets As Therapy\u201d cloak, shouting out the U.K. animal-therapy charity of the same name. Thank you, Ella. You look very beautiful and I love you and your ears and doggy body, and, of course, your message.\n\nIn January, Middleton spoke about his struggle with depression in an op-ed for the Daily Mail, noting how his dogs, Ella in particular, have helped. \u201cI recognize, too, the role my dogs \u2014 Ella, Inca, Luna, Zulu and Mabel \u2014 have played in my recovery,\u201d he said. He continued:\n\n\u201cElla, particularly, has been my constant companion for ten years and she\u2019s been with me to all my therapy sessions. In her own particular way, she has kept me going. As a result, Ella and I now volunteer with the Pets As Therapy charity and Ella is a fully-fledged therapy dog for PAT.\u201d\n\nOh, jeez. Well. This guy is certainly very hot, I think we can agree.", "description": "Kate Middleton\u2019s brother James Middleton walked the GQ Men of the Year Awards red carpet with his sweet therapy dog, Ella.", "authors": ["Kelly Conaboy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/04/4-james-middleton-and-therapy-dog.w1200.h630.jpg"}
