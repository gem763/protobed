Microsoft, likewise, has a similar cloud-based anti-phishing and anti-malware tool called SmartScreen built into most of its products such as Windows, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Outlook.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear if Tencent is actually collecting IP addresses from users residing outside of China or when Apple added the company to the list along with Google, but some tweets point to versions starting from iOS 12.2.\n\nSafari using Google Safe Browsing to identify phishing websites in macOS\n\nThe open-source WebKit browser rendering engine, which is the basis for Safari, also powers third-party browsers available on iOS due to restrictions imposed by Apple\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines (Section 2.5.6).\n\nGoogle, for instance, provides two different Safe Browsing APIs \u2014 a Lookup and an Update API, the former of which allows browsers to send URLs in plaintext to the Google Safe Browsing server to check their status. The search giant, in its documentation, acknowledges the privacy drawback: \u201cURLs are not hashed, so the server knows which URLs you look up.\u201d\n\nThe latter, in contrast, allows browsers to download encrypted versions of the Safe Browsing lists for local, client-side checks of URLs, meaning the safe browsing server never knows the actual URLs queried by Safari.\n\nRegardless of whether the safe browsing provider is Google or Tencent, if you\u2019re not comfortable with this setting being on by default, you can turn it off by following the steps listed below:\n\niOS: Settings > Safari > Turn off Fraudulent Website Warning\n\nmacOS: Safari > Preferences > Security > Uncheck Warn when visiting a fraudulent website\n\nCredit: Google Unsafe websites detected by Google Safe Browsing per week for the period 2006-2019\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting here that the tweak also increases the likelihood of accidentally visiting a phishing website that might make a \u201cfraudulent attempt to steal your personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and other account information.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s very much possible Tencent\u2019s blacklist is localized to China, where Google\u2019s services are blocked, and not elsewhere. But the development has come to the fore again at a time the iPhone maker is caught between a rock and a hard place with regards to its practices in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile they [Tencent] may be just as trustworthy, we deserve to be informed about this kind of change and to make choices about it,\u201d said Green. \u201cAt very least, users should learn about these changes before Apple pushes the feature into production, and thus asks millions of their customers to trust them.\u201d\n\nRead next: CHEAP: Screw Google's Pixel 4 \u2014 there's 39% off the 3XL", "description": "Apple attracts scrutiny for using Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent as a Safe Browsing provider to verify if websites are fraudulent.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F08%2FSAFARI.jpg&signature=971d2d2ff6f790882108fb00159c58bc", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
