You just can\u2019t do it, right? So you just go, \u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019 I\u2019m out, and you know what? With all my comedies \u2013 I think that what comedies in general all have in common \u2013 is they\u2019re irreverent,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cSo I go, \u2018How do I do something irreverent, but f--- comedy? Oh I know, let\u2019s take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this.\u2019 And so that\u2019s really where that came from.\u201d\n\nPhillips noted that the decision led him directly to Joaquin Phoenix and \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\nThe film depicts the infamous Batman antagonist in a never-before-seen light, offering a unique origin story to the immensely dark character and separating him from most of the Caped Crusader\u2019s typical lore.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d has been the subject of controversy after early screenings due to its depictions of violence and attempts to have the audience sympathize with the villain, a down-on-his-luck comedian shunned by society.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a movie about a fictional character in a fictional world, ultimately, and your hope is that people take it for what it is. You can\u2019t blame movies for a world that is so f---ed up that anything can trigger it,\" the director explained.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what the movie is about,\" Phillips added. \"It\u2019s not a call to action. If anything it\u2019s a call to self-reflection to society.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the titular star of \"Joker,\" Phoenix, 44, acknowledged that he predicted at least some criticism of the movie due to its subject matter, but that he hopes it will spark more meaningful conversations once people actually watch it.\n\n'JOKER\u2019 STAR JOAQUIN PHOENIX LEAVES INTERVIEW AFTER BEING ASKED IF MOVIE WILL \u2018INSPIRE\u2019 VIOLENCE\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t imagine that it would be smooth sailing,\u201d the actor admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult film. In some ways, it\u2019s good that people are having a strong reaction to it.\"\n\nThe \"Walk the Line\" star explained that he wanted to play the iconic \u201cBatman\u201d baddie in a way that the viewer could \"sympathize or empathize with this villain.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy for us to \u2014 we want the simple answers, we want to vilify people. It allows us to feel good if we can identify that as evil,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not healthy because we\u2019re not really examining our inherent racism that most white people have, certainly. Or whatever it may be. Whatever issues you may have. It\u2019s too easy for us and I felt like, yeah, we should explore this villain. This malevolent person.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real communication, and to me that\u2019s the value of this,\" Phoenix continued. \"I think that we are capable as an audience to see both of those things simultaneously and experience them and value them.\u201d\n\nFox News' Jessica Sager contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cJoker\u201d director Todd Phillips explained why he broke away from making comedies to do more dramatic films.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19267684859903-1.jpg"}
