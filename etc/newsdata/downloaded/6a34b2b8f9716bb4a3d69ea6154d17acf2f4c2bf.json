He was just the most adorable kid you could imagine.\n\n'But at some point in the intervening years, he started sequestering himself away from the world, and away from reality the way Elvis Presley did.'\n\nElton continued: 'God knows what was going on in his head, and God knows what prescription drugs he was being pumped full of, but every time I saw him in his later years I came away thinking the poor guy had totally lost his marbles.'\n\nExit: Dressed in a bright green jacket and an equally bold red shirt, the star was surrounded by fans as he and David attempted to make a low-key exit from the upmarket eatery\n\nStern expression: But despite his colourful ensemble, Elton appeared somewhat downcast as he got into his waiting car and headed home\n\nHe added: 'I don\u2019t mean that in the light-hearted way.

What I was doing clearly wasn\u2019t really his thing.'\n\nHe also claims that he was afraid of him.\n\nGeoff - who works as a carpenter and has a different mother to Elton, after Stanley split from first wife Sheila in 1962 and remarried second wife Edna and had four more sons with her - also insisted that Stanley was from a different generation, who were less generous with expressing their feelings.\n\n[Elton] is playing the blame card. But our parents came from war, where men had to be men and women had to be women. It\u2019s a different world,' Geoff said.\n\nTragic end: Michael suddenly of an overdose of sedatives administered by his personal physician, Conard Murray, in 2009.

I can remember him saying \"I love you\" but it was on his deathbed. There were four of us brothers there \u2013 Elton wasn\u2019t. I said \"Dad, I love you\". And he said, \"Yes, love is what it is all about\". That generation just didn\u2019t express emotion in the same way we do now.\n\n'My dad was proud of him, you could see when Elton popped up on TV, his eyes lit up.'\n\nElton\u2019s spokesman said: 'Elton stands by what he said in the book about his dad never seeing him perform.'\n\nGeoff spoke earlier this year about the way his father was portrayed in the film biopic Rocketman.\n\nFocusing on Elton's life, Geoff insisted that the movie vilifies their dad yet again and told the Mail this summer: 'That's not the Dad I remember.
