I'm going to end you.\"\n\nBut Poirier immediately took to Twitter to respond: \"I'm fighting the Irishman next. You're close but not yet buddy keep punching.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether a deal will be agreed, but McGregor is expected to fight either Poirier or Justin Gaethje as he seeks his first victory in the Octagon for three years.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nLast week, McGregor and Poirier continued to trade insults on Twitter.\n\nAfter the Dubliner had taunted Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz about their forthcoming fight, Poirier highlighted the last time McGregor won in the Octagon - his lightweight title win over Eddie Alvarez in November 2016.\n\nPoirier tweeted: \"Three years 10 days since you won your last fight. Do the math champ.\"\n\nBut McGregor hit back with: \"Awesome bro.
