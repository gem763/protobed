(Photo: Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center)\n\nIdentical twin sisters working as nurses at the same Georgia hospital crossed paths in the most serendipitous way.\n\nTori Howard and Tara Drinkard, 26, together helped deliver twin sisters, Addison and Emma Williams, at the Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center on Sept. 25 in Athens, Georgia.\n\nHoward, a nurse at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), said in a statement she knew that morning when she got to work that she was going to be in the delivery room with the Williams family.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know her sister was going to join her until right before the delivery.\n\nEmma and Addison Williams (Photo: Sydney D. Walker via Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center)\n\n\u201cWe knew we\u2019d cross paths in the delivery room eventually,\u201d Howard said. \u201cBut we never imagined our first experience would be with twin girls.\u201d\n\nDrinkard, a nurse working at the labor and delivery unit, said she didn\u2019t realize she was going to be in the delivery room with her sister until 10 minutes before the C-section was scheduled to take place.\n\n\u201cIt was so special to be in the twins\u2019 delivery with Tori,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe have always worked well together, even when we were little.\u201d\n\nEmma and Addison, born three minutes apart, required that there be two nurses to assist with the delivery, one nurse per baby.\n\nParents Brannan and Rebecca Williams told CNN they still have a relationship with the twin nurses and even ask their advice on how to raise their baby girls.\n\nRebecca and Brannan Williams get twin nurses' expert advice on raising their twin baby girls. (Photo: Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center)\n\n\u201c[They] have become our friends,\u201d Brannan Williams told the news outlet. \u201cI look forward to letting the girls know about this one day, and hopefully they\u2019ll get to meet them and keep carrying this thing on.\u201d\n\nThe Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center told USA TODAY the twin babies were discharged from the hospital Thursday.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/17/georgia-hospital-identical-twin-nurses-deliver-identical-twin-babies/4008963002/", "description": "Emma and Addison Williams were born at the Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center on Sept. 25 in Athens, Georgia.", "authors": ["Adrianna Rodriguez", "Published P.M.
