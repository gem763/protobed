'When we get to HART, we will be better, faster, stronger.'\n\nA photo is taken by DHS as well as a 10-fingerprint scanner for international arriving passengers at Dulles International Airport in 2007. The department is upgrading the system\n\nThe agency\u2019s existing database, the Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, launched in 1994, and currently has biometric data on 250 million people.\n\nIDENT stores traditional biometric data such as fingerprints, faces and irises. The new system will allow for additional data including scars, tattoos, palm prints, and more.\n\nHART will also allow for upgraded search capability using multiple factors.\n\nFor example, if authorities had a partial fingerprint and facial image from a suspect, on IDENT they would have to run two searches and compare the lists of possible matches.\n\nHART will allow for a combined search on any of the available biometric data points, improving the chances of a match.\n\nThe new HART system will be housed on Amazon Web Services' GoveCloud, rather than government servers.\n\nA DHS officer fingerprints a traveler from Ethiopia in this 2007 file photo. The agency's new biometric database will be able to store information about tattoos, scars and even voices\n\nAmazon Web Services already hosts various forms of sensitive US government data, with clients including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense and NASA.\n\nThe firm's GovCloud US-East and US-West region data centers have been custom built by Amazon to house the US government's most sensitive information.\n\nCompared with the government's legacy computer systems, Amazon's setup is reportedly perceived as being more secure.\n\nDevelopment of the HART system so far has been undertaken by global security firm Northrop Grumman, who landed a $95 million contract in 2018 for the first phase of the project, which involves streamline the IDENT database for transfer and will end in 2021.\n\nDHS announced a request for proposals on the second phase of the project in June. The second phase will involve construction of the HART system.\n\nDHS also reported an interest in exploring the development of various general analytics, reporting and search tools, alongside creating desktop computer and mobile web portals through which government employees can access the system.\n\nThe DHS information request document reported that the department engages in mutual sharing of biometric data with various agencies, including the Department of Defense, the FBI and the Department of State.\n\nThe FBI's own facial recognition database reportedly has access to 640 million photos, while the State Department\u2019s Consular Consolidated Database was reported in 2016 to contain records on almost 500 million passports, visas and expats.\n\nAlongside this, the DHS also reports having 'information sharing agreements with several foreign governments as well as State, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies.'\n\nThe US government's collection of biometric data \u2014 in particular from facial recognition systems \u2014 has been attracting much criticism of late.\n\nIn May 2019, both the Democrat and Republican members of the House Oversight Committee expressed broad support for curbing the use of facial recognition technology at the FBI and other similar law enforcement agencies.\n\nOne such other agency is the Customs and Border Patrol, which also received criticisms from US lawmakers on June 16 for their growing application of facial recognition systems.", "description": "Patrick Nemeth, director of identity operations within the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management, expounded upon the new system in an interview published on Thursday.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19313118-0-image-a-22_1570219127650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
