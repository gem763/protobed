I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable taking CBD oil. I would be too paranoid that there would be THC in it and then that obviously could lead to a positive test.\n\n\u201cI am the most conservative (person) on everything. I try not to take anything in terms of pills to help in any way. I\u2019m even scared to take painkillers sometimes, like an Advil, I would rather just not.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy starts his 2019-2020 PGA Tour season this week at Narashino Country Club and plans to repeat the US-centric schedule he employed this year.\n\nThe world number two won the Players Championship, Canadian Open and Tour Championship on his way to ending the season as FedEx Cup champion before switching his focus towards the European Tour.\n\n\u201cI think I definitely realised how travel affects me, and not just crossing time zones, but the effect that has on you not just the first week but the few weeks after that,\u201d McIlroy said.\n\n\u201cI feel like I performed my best all the way through the season for the most part and I definitely haven\u2019t travelled as much this year as I have done in the past, especially bouncing back and forth across the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that I\u2019m going to try to replicate going forward. I\u2019ll start my season in the US and I\u2019m going to play the Irish Open next year, which is at the end of May. I\u2019ll go back for that, but that\u2019s the only scenario where I\u2019ll go back until before The Open Championship.\n\n\u201cThat gives me a solid sort of six months in the States where I\u2019m not having to travel a bunch and I think that helped how I performed last season.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Rory McIlroy admits he is \u201cparanoid\u201d about the possibility of failing a drugs test in the wake of Matt Every receiving a three-month ban.
