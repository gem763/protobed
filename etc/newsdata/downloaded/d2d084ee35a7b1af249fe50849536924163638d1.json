It\u2019s so tall and unique that it\u2019s obvious that Sony wanted to make it stand out from the pack of Android phones. In a world dominated by Samsung and Huawei, Sony needed to give people a specific, differentiating reason to consider its phones. The alternative at this point is, well, giving up on phones entirely \u2014 instead of just mostly.\n\nThere are enough benefits to the Xperia 1\u2019s super tall form factor to actually make you consider it, weird as that may seem. It\u2019s a big phone that doesn\u2019t feel like a big phone. Sony\u2019s pitch for the Xperia 1 is about it being more \u201ccinematic.\u201d Sony claims it has a cinematic screen, color reproduction, and camera. Those are the non-phone things that other divisions of Sony are good at, but the company has never really managed to translate those strengths to mobile.\n\nYes, the Xperia 1 stands out, but making a unique form factor is easy. Making a good, complete package is not. Credit where credit is due: Sony has done a better job of making a good high-end phone than it has in quite some time. But we shouldn\u2019t grade on a curve here. The Xperia 1 doesn\u2019t stand out in as many ways as it should \u2014 especially at a price of $950.\n\nThe best thing about the Xperia 1 is you get a bunch of the benefits of having a big-screened phone in a design that\u2019s much easier to fit in your hand. The Xperia 1 has a 6.5-inch screen, which is huge even by 2019\u2019s plus-sized phone standards. But because of the 21:9 aspect ratio, it\u2019s significantly narrower than the competition. It\u2019s almost precisely the same width as an iPhone XS.\n\nI have waffled between wanting to use an XL phone and a smaller, one-handed phone for the past few years. Every time I grab a big phone, I love it \u2014 until the basic ergonomics of handling that slab of glass become annoying. Similarly, I love how comfortable small phones are \u2014 until everything starts to feel a little cramped.\n\nThe Xperia 1 very nearly gives us the best of both. I can see way more content on any app that has a list of things: email, Twitter, webpages. I can also comfortably hold the device in one hand and type with one thumb. If you\u2019re the sort of person who wants split-screen apps on a phone, the Xperia 1 really is better for that experience.\n\nBut make no mistake: this is still a big-screened phone, and you will still need two hands to use it. The top of the screen is very far away from your thumb. It\u2019s also not more pocketable than other big phones. In fact, it might be worse. It\u2019s so tall that it didn\u2019t sit in my front jeans pocket properly, and it slid right out when I was sitting down, clattering on the concrete. The metal corners were dinged; the Gorilla Glass, thankfully, survived.\n\nIt\u2019s also awkward when it comes to buttons: they\u2019re all on the right side, and there are a lot of them. There\u2019s volume, a fingerprint sensor, a separate power button, and a camera button. (For whatever reason, I was hitting the wrong one all the time.) It\u2019s odd that the fingerprint sensor and power button aren\u2019t combined, and it\u2019s even odder that it seems to so easily pick up just enough grime that it needs a quick wipe before it works. You can double press the power button to launch Google Assistant, which I like.\n\nSony says this is a 4K HDR OLED screen. The resolution here is 3840 x 1644, which is more of a phone version of 4K than a movie version where you usually get 2160 pixels on the short side. But since this is 21:9 and if you just count the pixels and yadda yadda yadda: fine, it\u2019s 4K.\n\nSimilarly, Sony is touting HDR as a big deal, but I still think HDR on a phone is not something most people can really see. I\u2019m more impressed by the color claims, which Sony calls \u201cCreator Mode.\u201d What it actually does is attempt to match the color reproduction from a reference monitor \u2014 with the DCI-P3 color gamut and the BT.2020 standard. Of course, it can\u2019t actually match a reference monitor, but turning on Creator Mode made colors appear much more accurate but less vibrant than you might be used to on other phones.\n\nYou can also set that mode to only turn on in certain supported apps, like Netflix. Speaking of Netflix, movies from it really do seem like the ideal use case for this phone. Watching a widescreen movie is great: there\u2019s good stereo separation, support for Dolby Atmos, and, best of all, no notch or camera cutout.\n\nThe thing is, the majority of video that I watch on my phone is not 21:9. It\u2019s 4:3 on YouTube or, at best, 16:9. Whatever the aspect ratio, I end up having to choose between giant black bars on either side of the video or going full-screen and cutting off people\u2019s heads. That\u2019s a hassle, but this screen\u2019s biggest problem will become obvious the moment you step outside: it doesn\u2019t get nearly bright enough, especially compared to other OLEDs.\n\nSony has two software tricks to manage this plus-sized size. The first is double tapping the home button to shrink the whole interface down to a place where your thumb can reach. This is really well done; you can resize the shrunken-down version of Android to your liking.\n\nThe other software trick is called Side Sense, and it\u2019s a huge pain. Like Samsung\u2019s Edge Sense, Sony has added extra features you can access by interacting with the very edge of the screen. You can bring up a quick app launcher, pull down the notification shade, save split-screen app combos, and more. Side Sense doesn\u2019t lack for options. Unlike Samsung, Sony has completely botched how you launch it.\n\nIn theory, the left and right rails around the screen are touch-sensitive, so you can tap or swipe on the edges of the screen to activate Side Sense features. In practice, I can never get Side Sense to actually work. It almost never pops up when I\u2019m trying to use it and \u2014 even worse \u2014 it somehow manages to pop up when I am not trying to trigger it.\n\nHere\u2019s an enduring mystery of the smartphone world: nearly every phone with a camera that\u2019s worth a damn uses Sony\u2019s sensors, and yet Sony itself has a terrible reputation when it comes to image quality on its own phones. With the Xperia 1, I think Sony is getting closer to knocking that monkey off its back. The images it produces are respectable, though still not as good as what you\u2019ll get out of a OnePlus 7 Pro or Pixel 3.\n\nThere are three 12-megapixel sensors: a regular, a wide, and a 2X telephoto. I wish the telephoto had a little more zoom, but the wide is as fun as I expected. It\u2019s fun, but the phones are only middling image quality. You do have the option to leave the distortion in if you want to capture as much of a scene as possible and then straighten it out in post. The Xperia 1 borrows eye-tracking autofocus from Sony\u2019s actual cameras, and it works well. You can see the little green box that lets you know on which person the camera is focused.\n\nThe camera is respectable, but not when you consider the price of the phone\n\nI am not in love with Sony\u2019s camera software. The special modes are a little gimmicky, and its attempts at portrait mode are slightly embarrassing. But the camera launches quickly and takes photos reliably, which is (sadly) more than you can say about the Pixel 3. I truly dislike the 8-megapixel selfie camera, which creates downright terrible photos and has some of the most overbearing beauty filters I\u2019ve ever tried.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say Sony\u2019s aim with its image processing is to preserve detail, but that also seems to mean its photos are too noisy. That would make sense in a Pro mode with RAW output, but Sony\u2019s manual mode doesn\u2019t offer that. And Sony\u2019s manual mode is the only way to get real HDR results, which is a bummer because the auto-HDR that\u2019s available on other Android phones produces much more pleasing images by default compared to the Xperia 1.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one place where the Xperia 1 did surprise me: low light. It doesn\u2019t have a dedicated night mode, but in auto when you shoot in the dark, it\u2019ll default to spending more time gathering light and present you with solid results. It doesn\u2019t do the night-into-daytime thing that Huawei and Google pull off, but sometimes, I find those night modes to be overbearing anyway.\n\nSony\u2019s saving grace is that it has CineAlta Cinema Pro software for shooting 4K video in full manual mode, with really specific controls for key camera settings. Its interface is clear and easy to use, and even though it disables OIS, I think it would be a treat to use for cinematographers.\n\nIn terms of software and performance, I don\u2019t have a ton of complaints. It runs a fairly clean version of Android 9 with just a few bells and whistles. One of those is a silly option to have the phone vibrate in sync with the sound. It is bad. Don\u2019t use it.\n\nLike every other modern Android phone, the Xperia 1 has a Snapdragon 855 processor. Combined with the clean build of Android, it makes for a fast phone. There\u2019s 6GB of RAM and only one storage option of 128GB. I\u2019m a little grumpy about the storage (especially at this price), but it\u2019s easily expanded with a microSD card slot.\n\nBattery life is average, at least when it comes to big phones. I\u2019m getting over four hours of screen time, and it\u2019s lasting through a day. But it\u2019s only a 3,300mAh battery, and I kind of feel like that\u2019s not enough. There\u2019s no wireless charging, either. But Sony does do a neat thing: when you\u2019re charging overnight, it won\u2019t fast-charge, which should help the battery\u2019s longevity over time. (The iPhone will begin doing the same thing starting with iOS 13.)\n\nXperia phones have historically been the clearest expression of the worst parts of Sony\u2019s brand: overpriced, bad software, and designed for beauty over ergonomics. They\u2019ve played on the things people love about Sony but failed to deliver those things.\n\nWhen it comes to price, Sony\u2019s gonna Sony\n\nThe Xperia 1 resolves those problems \u2014 mostly. The software is significantly improved, even with misses like Side Sense. The cameras use the branding and even some of the tech of its mirrorless cameras, but they aren\u2019t the best you can get. Sony\u2019s design is still great and, compared to other massive phones, much easier to hold in one hand. I really do like this form factor, and I\u2019m glad Sony is giving it a shot.\n\nThat leaves the price. There, sadly, all I can say is: Sony\u2019s gonna Sony. $950 is simply too much for a phone of this caliber. If the Xperia 1 cost a few hundred dollars less \u2014 the same as competing Android phones like the OnePlus 7 Pro \u2014 I\u2019d be more enthusiastic about the progress Sony has made on its phones.\n\nInstead, I\u2019m just bummed. The Xperia 1 is a really nice phone, the kind that makes you think maybe Sony shouldn\u2019t lower its ambitions in mobile. But for $950, I expect more.
