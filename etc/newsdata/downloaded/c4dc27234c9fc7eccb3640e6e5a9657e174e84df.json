The fall auction held mid-October in Toronto by Collector Car Productions shows both strength and weakness in the marketplace.\n\nFor example, a desirable 1956 Ford Sunliner convertible that looked to be in decent driver-quality condition sold for $17,600 with the 10-per-cent buyer\u2019s fee. A much better restored Sunliner with lots of options and upgrades including modernized power steering and disc brakes was a no-sale at a high bid of $46,000.\n\nI have watched similar cars at this same auction sell in past years for up to $85,000. The market is changing. The Ford Sunliner sales tell the story.\n\nThe people who loved these cars when both were younger are crossing the divide. Many collectors in their 70s and 80s are downsizing their garages. Some are selling all their collector vehicles. The collectors who are still buying these cars have become extremely price-conscious. There are bargains to be had.\n\nAt the same auction last weekend, a rare Canadian-built 1954 Meteor Rideau Sunliner convertible crossed the block selling for $15,900 \u2014 that\u2019s unheard of. Ford of Canada built about 400 of these Canadian-only convertibles, and only a handful are left.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this was a good car or a made-up car from parts of others. But it sure looks like a bargain for some lucky buyer.\n\nOn the other end of the auction results, an extremely collectible 2006 Ford GT in red brought the auction hammer down at $352,000. And a well-restored and highly optioned dusk rose 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible drew a winning bid of $74,800.\n\nI believe these are still bargains, because the above-mentioned top sellers at Canada\u2019s most recognized classic car auction would likely draw the same money at sales south of the border \u2014 in U.S. funds. Buyers could earn up to 30 per cent on their money, simply by adjusting the geographical location for the next sale of the car.\n\nHowever, one must factor in transportation, auction fees and other costs. So a big profit isn\u2019t a slam dunk.\n\nAs someone who has been a keen observer of the hobby for the past four decades, I have never seen a more challenging market for collector vehicles in Canada. They still sell, and many for decent money. But there are fewer buyers, cars stay on the market much longer and some owners have had to be extremely realistic regarding what they will sell their vehicles for.\n\nAn example is a recently sold 1937 Buick Special four-door convertible. The Ontario owner did a very nice restoration on the classic, which had been completely disassembled and then put back together with rebuilt mechanics, genuine leather upholstery and wide whitewall radial tires.\n\nAt the spring auction, the bidding didn\u2019t come anywhere near to the owner\u2019s expectations of more than $50,000. Certainly, much more money must have been spent on the car. The rare Buick subsequently sold privately for $36,000 \u2014 a very good buy.\n\nThis is illustrative of how interest in cars of that vintage is waning as hobbyists who love those cars are fewer in numbers.\n\nAuctions are a great appraisal tool to establish collector vehicle values. It shows what the buyer will sell the vehicle for, and what someone will pay for it, at that time and location. Owners can\u2019t expect high U.S.-dollar prices when they are selling their cars in Canada \u2014 unless the vehicle is spectacular or has extremely high collectability.\n\nIt is very hard to define values by looking solely at advertised asking prices and auction results. Many desirable collector vehicles change hands by word of mouth. They never officially come on the market.\n\nWhat\u2019s hot and what\u2019s not? Performance European cars including vintage Mercedes-Benz and Porsche sports cars and convertible examples continue to increase in value.\n\n\u201cOne of the hottest cars in the marketplace today is the air-cooled Porsche 911, particularly the 1997, the last air-cooled model; and the Carrera cabriolet offered through 1998,\u201d says appraiser and master concours d\u2019elegance judge John Carlson.\n\nThere are bargains to be had at classic car auctions in Canada, as values of cars from the 1950s and muscle cars of the 1960s slump Collector Car Productions\n\nThis 1956 Ford Fairlane Sunliner sold at the Toronto collector car auction this fall at the bargain basement price of $17,600. Collector Car Productions\n\nThis fully optioned 1957 Chevrolet BelAir convertible brought a winning bid of $74,800 at the Toronto fall collector car auction Collector Car Productions\n\nThis well-restored and highly optioned 1956 Ford Fairlane Sunliner convertible was a no-sale at the Toronto auction with a closing bid of $46,000 Collector Car Productions\n\nA closing bid of $352,000 bought this 2006 Ford GT at the Toronto collector car auction. Collector Car Productions\n\nA 1954 Meteor Rideau Sunliner that sold at the Toronto auction for $15,900 is reflective of slumping prices for classic convertibles of the 1950s. Collector Car Productions\n\nThis restored 1937 Buick Special convertible sedan sold privately for $36,000 after attracting little interest at the spring Toronto collector car auction. Collector Car Productions\n\nJapanese collectibles, including any Acura NSX model, along with Datsun Z sports cars of the \u201970s and early \u201980s, have seen prices double in the past few years. There are others.\n\n\u201cIf friends and family had listened to me, they would have snapped up every Acura Integra Type RS,\u201d says Nigel Matthews of Hagerty Insurance. \u201cThat car sold new for $27,000. Today, they are commanding north of US$60,000.\u201d\n\nAny collectible with Carroll Shelby\u2019s name on it is a big seller, particularly the big-block fastback and convertible models from the late 1960s.\n\nFull classics including Packard and Cadillac open cars continue to be traded like rare pieces of art, and are holding or increasing their value.\n\nBut restored Chevy and Ford convertibles from the 1950s and muscle cars from the 1960s, with a few exceptions, are abundant and have been over-valued in the past. The market is flat for these cars, although some very special models will always draw top money.\n\nProject vehicles have really taken a hit. It may be a nice vehicle when restored but, if it\u2019s a basket case, un-restored or a work-in-progress collectible, it will be very hard to sell.\n\nCollectors are gun-shy \u2013 with soaring costs of labour and materials \u2013 to rebuild vehicles at a time when standards for restoration have increased substantially.\n\nGreat collectible vehicles still sell \u2014 many for good money. But owners are experiencing a changing marketplace with fewer enthusiasts to buy their cars, and not as many younger people entering the hobby.", "description": "Older cars are seeing demand fall away from supply, but newer classics show the market isn't trending completely downward", "authors": ["Collector Car Productions", "Days Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/1956-sunliner.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
