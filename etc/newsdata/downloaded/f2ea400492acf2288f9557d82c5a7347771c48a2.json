The Houthis have long been fighting a brutal war against the US-supported Saudi coalition in Yemen, and have enough incentives to attack Saudi Arabia.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of launching the attacks in language that could set the stage for a potential retaliatory strike.\n\nJohn Bolton\u2019s recent exit from the White House raised the prospect of Trump moving in the direction of diplomacy and away from a potential war with Iran. But less than a week after Bolton\u2019s departure, the war of words has resumed. Trump threatened Iran on Twitter, saying that the US military is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d. And an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said that they are ready for a war.\n\n\n\n\n\nJamal Abdi, president of the National Iranian American Council, a grassroots organisation in Washington, says Bolton's exit could be an opportunity for Trump to pivot but may have been merely a cosmetic fix.\n\nHe told The Independent that \u201cwith people like Mike Pompeo still in the administration and little leadership from Trump, there may be no real will to pivot.\u201d\n\nPolls have shown that there is no appetite in the United States for another Middle Eastern war. Americans have understood the high costs of war and have been demanding their leaders end the ones they already started. Besides the occasional Lindsey Graham and Fox and Friends comments, the overwhelming voice out of Washington today is against a new war.\n\nAnd Trump echoes that anti-war voice.\n\nThe temporary opening for a limited military action on Iran after their shooting of a US drone, was a test of Trump\u2019s will for going to war. And he showed that he doesn\u2019t want to start the conflict.\n\nBut his isolationist profile contradicts his aggressive rhetoric. And the hawkish cabinet he has surrounded himself with are trying to push him into incremental and limited military strikes that can eventually escalate into a point of no return.\n\nBack in June, Pompeo was one of Trump\u2019s top aides who supported limited strikes and seems like he still does.\n\nStephen Miles, executive director at Win Without War, an advocacy organisation in Washington, said: \"The Trump administration found a Middle East full of kindling, and decided to pour gasoline all over it. Now a spark won\u2019t just start a fire but an inferno.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6077693605001\n\nDonald Trump and Hassan Rouhani suggest they could meet to resolve US-Iran crisis\n\nWhile Iran does not have the military capabilities of the US and its allies in the Persian Gulf, Tehran has long prepared for a day like this. Iranians have beefed up their defence systems and created leverage through various proxies across the Middle East. So even limited strikes on Iran can easily and quickly escalate into a regional war.\n\nBut although Tehran may be ready for a war, they do not want to start it.\n\nRuhollah Nakhaee, diplomatic correspondent at Iran\u2019s prominent Shargh newspaper, says Iran\u2019s strategy is to continue the step-by-step pressure on Europe to force them to take action, while containing Iranian hardliners in order to avoid starting a war.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=5837728067001\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nHe told The Independent there has been no \u201cunjustifiable action\u201d from Iranian military forces that could hurt Iran\u2019s diplomatic stance. \u201cBest scenario is that Trump returns to the JCPOA (the nuclear deal from which the US unilaterally withdrew) and negotiations restart, and if that does not happen Iran is still buying time and trying to prevent a disaster.\"\n\nBut as long as Trump is not willing to abandon his maximum pressure campaign of crippling sanctions on Iran, he may not be able to start real diplomacy with Tehran. Trump may have dug himself a hole without any real way out of it. And the great deal-maker persona that he has been trying to maintain is more and more turning into a war hawk.\n\nRead more\n\nIran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards are running rings around Trump\n\nTrump must consider attack on Iran, Lindsay Graham urges\n\nThe world is a mess of fragile tyrants, so Israel can plunder at will\n\nIran is detaining British citizens and this is how they'll use them\n\nIran says tanker has reached destination and oil has been sold", "description": "Washington and Tehran entered yet another phase of sabre rattling and high tension over the weekend.Following attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities that disrupted the global market, the Trump administration quickly pointed fingers at Iran.", "authors": ["Negar Mortazavi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7OYvY7WcBgBbOHKtTHoy1Q--~B/aD0zOTM7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/503c943be5a2214a951aa99db37ad1e7", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
