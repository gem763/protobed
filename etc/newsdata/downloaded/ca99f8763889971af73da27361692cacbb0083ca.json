Cerro Dominador Solar Power Plant/Handout via REUTERS\n\nATACAMA DESERT, Chile (Reuters) - Rising out of Chile\u2019s Atacama desert, the half-built Cerro Dominador solar tower reflects the challenge the South American country faces as it races to meet some of the most ambitious renewables targets in the world.\n\nChile, readying to host a major United Nations climate change conference in December, has already pledged to phase out coal-fired power by 2040 and be carbon neutral by 2050. But in a bid to hold other countries to further-reaching pledges, it is now looking for ways to bring forward its own deadlines.\n\nA surge in lower cost solar panels from China in recent years has helped to place it within a whisker of its target to get 20% of its power from renewables by 2025.\n\nA key concern now is how to store and transmit its bountiful solar and wind power, spreading it over 24 hours. That would help Chile make the leap to obtaining 60% of its power from renewables by 2035 and 70% by 2050, becoming, as environment minister Carolina Schmidt described it, \u201cthe Saudi Arabia of clean energy.\u201d\n\nEnter Cerro Dominador, a $1.3 billion project announced in 2013, touting technology designed to make the renewable energy supply more stable.\n\nCerro Dominador\u2019s unique selling point is that - unlike traditional photovoltaic solar plants or wind powered-plants, which produce as long as their source is shining or blowing - it allows the sun\u2019s heat to be stored to generate electricity for hours afterwards, including at night.\n\nIt represented Latin America\u2019s first venture into the technology, called Concentrating Solar Power (CSP).\n\nThe project was hailed by government and industry as a key component of Chile\u2019s vow to wean itself off imported fossil fuels and large hydroelectric centers, which are struggling to stay online amid a persistent and deepening drought.\n\nCerro Dominador uses tens of thousands of pivoting mirrors to reflect the sun\u2019s rays onto a smaller area, where they can be converted into thermal energy via a liquefied salt heat storage system to drive electric turbines.\n\nAt its launch in 2014, the then-chief executive of the company building the project, Spain\u2019s Abengoa, told his audience that Cerro Dominador would cut CO2 emissions by 643,000 tonnes each year and bolster the Chilean government\u2019s bid to depend on \u201cclean, competitive and sustainable\u201d energy.\n\n\u201cWith 112 plants like this one, Chile would be autonomous in energy matters,\u201d said Manuel S\u00e1nchez.\n\nBut two years later, Abengoa came close to bankruptcy and was forced to sell Cerro Dominador, slowing construction of the plant as new buyers were sought.\n\nThe delay was costly.\n\nBy the time the plant was resurrected last year with funding from banks, the Chilean state and U.S. private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners, it was no longer competitive, or particularly sustainable.\n\nThe market had been flooded with cheap solar panels from China that had helped accelerate Chile\u2019s targets, but meant that Cerro Dominador\u2019s output was only useful for the half of the day not covered by the panels, according to Cristi\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, solar energy projects coordinator at state development agency Corfo.\n\nOther CSP plants have dropped off. Corfo\u2019s Solar Committee said five plants with a planned capacity of between 70MW and 450MW had environmental permits approved in the past four years. However, three of those have since been scrapped, the companies involved confirmed to Reuters, without elaborating. A fourth had been scrapped but was recently revived by EIG, the fund confirmed to Reuters.\n\n\u201cToday it makes no economic sense to generate with CSP during the day, because that\u2019s what photovoltaics are for and they are much cheaper,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez told Reuters.\n\nHe called for more modest CSP plants making up a smaller part of the energy mix, supplying power only when other sources are offline.\n\nThe prices Abengoa had agreed in a contract to supply to the national grid were three times higher than the present day\u2019s.\n\nMar\u00eda Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez, of Chilean energy consultancy Energetica, said the deal struck would be \u201cunfeasible\u201d in today\u2019s highly competitive renewables market.\n\nWith a striking tower that looms 250 meters (820 ft) above the bone-dry desert, Cerro Dominador\u2019s 100MW solar plant is up and running but its CSP plant, which cost $1 billion of the original outlay, will only be fully operational in 2020.\n\nCerro Dominador\u2019s CEO Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez told Reuters during a tour of the site in July that the same plant would not be built again.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that future plants will be much more competitive, both for market conditions and because of technological advances,\u201d he said.\n\nThe investment had been made with an eye on the longer term and future government auctions, a company spokesman said, adding that falling technology and construction costs should make a second such development competitive.\n\nSTUMBLING BLOCKS\n\nChile\u2019s electricity generation matrix relies primarily on largely imported fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil (55%), and its own hydroelectric plants (30%). However, unconventional energy provision has surged in recent years, with solar farms representing 6.5% of the matrix, wind power 5% and biomass 2.1% in 2018, according to the power generation companies\u2019 association.\n\nBut CSP is not the only renewables technology to have stumbled. Espejo de Tarapac\u00e1, 100km (62 miles) from Iquique in Chile\u2019s extreme north, generated significant excitement when it was announced as an innovative pumped storage hydroelectric energy plant.\n\nIts environmental permit was approved in 2015 and the project was due to come into operation this year, but ground to a halt as costs escalated. It is now in \u201cfinancial restructuring,\u201d Juan Andr\u00e9s Camus, the head of the project, told Reuters, adding that construction should begin next year.\n\nAnalysts and experts said Chile needs small, flexible and diverse projects, which will between them provide a stable network and help cut emissions.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t put all their eggs in one basket but try everything, take advantage of all kinds of technologies,\u201d said Pablo Demarco, commercial director of the Chilean energy brokerage Plataforma Energ\u00eda.\n\nBut without offering the direct subsidies other governments use to influence what comes online or investing in technological development, Chile\u2019s government has to hope its open market approach will help it continue to reach its clean energy goals.\n\nEnergy Minister Juan Carlos Jobet told Reuters the government had no particular preference of renewables technology, provided it represents value for money.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that they are able to offer energy 24/7 at a reasonable cost,\u201d he said.", "description": "Rising out of Chile's Atacama desert, the half-built Cerro Dominador solar tower reflects the challenge the South American country faces as it races to meet some of the most ambitious renewables targets in the world.", "authors": ["Natalia A.
