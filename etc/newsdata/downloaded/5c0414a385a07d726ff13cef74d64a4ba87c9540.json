(AP) - Patriots defensive end Michael Bennett is back with the team after serving a one-game suspension for what he said was a \u201cphilosophical disagreement\u201d with defensive line coach Bret Bielema.\n\nBut whether the suspension will improve his standing on a defense in which he\u2019s seen his playing time diminish throughout the season is still an open question.\n\nBennett was reinstated by the Patriots on Tuesday after sitting out New England\u2019s 33-0 win over the New York Jets on Monday night. He returned to practice Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in the locker room afterward, he said he didn\u2019t have any big takeaways from the suspension.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take away nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI got suspended, lost money. What am I supposed to take away from that? There is no love lost. It\u2019s just what it is.\u201d\n\nCoach Bill Belichick was equally coy about the impact of the suspension.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve moved past a lot of things this year. We\u2019re onto the Browns,\u201d he said, alluding to the Patriots matchup with Cleveland this Sunday.\n\nAsked if he felt as if he was still on good terms with the coaching staff, Bennett said only, \u201cYou have to ask them.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons could be that for one of the first times in his career, the 33-year-old veteran is struggling to find a defined role on a defense that currently tops the NFL in several categories.\n\nBennett began the season by playing in 55 percent of the defensive snaps (37 plays) in the Patriots\u2019 season-opening win over Pittsburgh.\n\nBut his playing time has steadily decreased since then, falling to just 11 snaps (22 percent) against the Giants in Week 6.\n\nPart of the reason is the Patriots have adjusted from a 4-3 base defense, which Bennett excelled in as an edge rusher during his time with Seattle and Philadelphia, to a 3-4 defense in which he is being asked to rush from the inside.\n\nAs a result, his production has suffered.\n\nLast season with the Eagles he had nine sacks, 30 quarterback hits and 34 tackles, including 15 for a loss.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the big reasons why the Patriots traded a fifth-round draft pick in 2020 to Philadelphia in March for Bennett, whom they hoped could fill the void left when Trey Flowers departed in free agency. New England underscored its faith in Bennett by giving him a reworked, two-year contract that would be worth as much as $16.75 million.\n\nBut in his six games with the Patriots he has only 2\u00bd sacks, four quarterback hits and five tackles (three for a loss).\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s been hard to be himself in New England but acknowledged that not being on the field as much as he has in the past has affected him.\n\n\u201cPlaying is always one thing, but not playing is always another thing,\u201d he said.\n\nThat lack of usage has fueled speculation that the Patriots could trade him prior to the deadline on Oct. 29.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s up to them and how they feel about it,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI like playing here.\u201d\n\nAs far as what he plans to do to improve his standing before then, Bennett said he can only be himself.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t really bite your tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody else in the league says what they feel. I just say how I feel and move on from there. We\u2019re just all human. We all go through our own situations. You can have conversations and move on from it. That\u2019s how I feel about it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patriots defensive end Michael Bennett is back with the team after serving a one-game suspension for what he said was a \"philosophical disagreement\" with defensive line coach Bret Bielema.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/patriots_football_82456_c0-187-4500-2812_s1200x700.jpg?e7bfb14d9f18d96bf7727a1f6aeaba1f8edc4758", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
