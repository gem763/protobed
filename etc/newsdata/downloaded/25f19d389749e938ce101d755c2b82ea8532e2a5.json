(The interim trilogy, which began with George Lucas's 1999 film The Phantom Menace, were the oft-criticized prequels starring Hayden Christensen.)\n\nDisney Parks named the new planet in an announcement pertaining to Star Tours \u2014 The Adventures Continues, the popular ride in Disney's various theme parks, which will add a 'tour' of Kef Bir as part of that attraction to be timed with the release of the new film.\n\nTrailblazer: One of those settings, seen in the briefest of glimpses in both this weekend's trailer as well as the first teaser for the film, now has an official name\n\nMoney shot: In the trailers for the latest Star Wars film, vistas of the remains of the Death Star are seen over a wide swath of angry ocean, which presumably marks the onscreen debut of ocean moon Kef Bir\n\nWhile some fans suspected a return to the forest moon from the Return Of The Jedi in this final film due to glimpses of the downed Death Star, the fact that it's suspended over roiling ocean waves leads one to assume the action is in a different place altogether.\n\nOther points in the latest trailer, however, might very well be on Endor's forest moon that was the home to the Ewoks: like at the beginning of the clip, when Rey (hero Daisy Ridley) is seen running through a forest.\n\nIt has yet to be revealed whether Kef Bir is a 'sibling moon' to the forest moon of Endor, but it does look promising that the two moons \u2014 one covered in water, the other in trees \u2014 might be complementary to one another.\n\nQuick: Other brief shots are seen in this weekend's final trailer for the film, with a speeder hurtling over ocean waves toward the Death Star remains\n\nIn all its glory: The ocean moon Kef Bir\n\nReturn of the Ewoks? Other settings in the trailer may very well point to a return to the forest moon of Endor from 1983's Return Of The Jedi\n\nThose wanting further details on Kef Bir will have to wait \u2014 Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker hits theaters on December 20th.\n\nThe film will feature some of the last footage of the late Carrie Fisher, who famously played Leia Organa.\n\nOn that same date, the new ocean moon destination will also be added to Star Tours at Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort, Tokyo Disneyland Park, as well as Disneyland Paris.\n\nShowdown in the ruins: Those wanting further details on Kef Bir will have to wait til the movie's release", "description": "The story famously takes place 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...' and moviegoers have enjoyed exploring said faraway galaxy for the past 40 years.", "authors": ["Dan Heching For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/00/20108070-0-image-a-58_1571871874372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
