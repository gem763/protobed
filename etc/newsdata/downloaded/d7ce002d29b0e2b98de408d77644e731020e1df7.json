Texas ranks high among the states in terms of the percentage of the population that is suburban. And statewide, whites are a minority.\n\nIn 2008, with the Great Recession underway, John McCain carried Texas by 12 points. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried it by 16. In 2016, Trump (whom Hurd did not endorse) won by nine points. In Texas\u2019s most important 2018 contest for a federal office, incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won by just three. See a trend?\n\nIf the Democratic Party can collect Texas\u2019s electoral votes \u2014 38 today, perhaps 41 after the 2020 Census \u2014 as well as California\u2019s 55, it will reap 35.5 percent of a winning 270 from just two states. Then the GOP will have almost no plausible path to 270, and Democrats who are currently hot to abolish the electoral college will suddenly say: Oh, never mind.", "description": "", "authors": ["George Will", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Texodus-Bodes-Badly-For-Republicans"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
