Where this ranks as a performance we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not historians.\n\n\u201cWhat we do know is that we can play better next week.\u201d\n\nEngland had the All Blacks on the back foot from the moment they lined up in V-formation and closed in on them during the pre-match haka.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure they understood we would be ready for the fight,\u201d said Mako Vunipola.\n\nReferee Nigel Owens actually had to warn Joe Marler to move back in order that the men in black could perform the famous Maori war-dance.\n\n\u201cHope they don\u2019t live to regret that,\u201d World Cup winner Matt Dawson said from the sidelines, saying what England fans were doubtless thinking.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nHe need not have worried. Not on this day, in this town, with this team, for England were simply sensational.\n\nIf New Zealand came into the contest as gods they left as mere mortals, so bruised that coach Steve Hansen appeared to offer out a journalist who questioned whether his players had turned up with the right attitude.\n\nCondemning what he saw as disrespect, Hansen snapped: \u201cIf you want to spend some time outside I\u2019ll give you a rugby education on that one.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe mood in the England camp could not have been more different after a game which started with a bang - Manu Tuilagi scoring in just 98 seconds.\n\nBy half-time England led 10-0, only the second time this century New Zealand had reached the break scoreless.\n\nAnd despite tries by Sam Underhill and Ben Youngs being chalked off they were so far the better side that New Zealand were resigned to the end of their 18-match, 12-year unbeaten run at the World Cup quite some time before the final whistle confirmed it.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"We stepped up to the plate today,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cWe played as well as we possibly could. We just got beaten by a better team. The team that took the game won the game. We have to take that on the chin.\u201d\n\nEngland had giants all over the park, none more so than man of the match Maro Itoje, who won three turnovers and seven lineouts.\n\nUnderhill and Tom Curry, the back row flanker duo Jones calls his \u2018Kamikaze Kids\u2019 were also revelations as England finished the game with 16 turnovers, the most by any side at this tournament.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou remember the meeting four years ago at Pennyhill Park, our first meeting together,\u201d said Jones, as bookies installed his rampant side as odds-on favourites to become champions again. \u201cWe said we wanted to be the best team in the world.\n\n\u201cWe're not the best team in the world but we've now got an opportunity to play in a game where we can prove we are.\u201d\n\nENGLAND - Try: Tuilagi. Con: Farrell. Pen: Ford 4.\n\nNEW ZEALAND - Try: Savea.
