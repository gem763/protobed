USA TODAY\n\n\"I do think David's for a while lost its North Star,\" said Marcum, a retail veteran who most recently served as senior operating partner of private-equity firm Apollo Global Management.\n\nFor example, he said, the company's website was shipping wedding dresses immediately after they were purchased, while in-store purchases took much longer to arrive. The website would offer sales that weren't offered in stores. Store purchases were considered final, but online sales could be returned.\n\nTree vs. Amazon: Amazon declares war on Dollar Tree and Dollar General\n\nFun or fraud? Welcome to the world of 'replica\" Lamborghinis, Bugattis\n\n\"We've moved very quickly to change those policies,\" Marcum said. Deliveries of dresses bought in stores will be sped up, and online and offline prices will be matched.\n\nSpeed is of the essence. The company's operating performance in the four months after emerging from bankruptcy in January was \"significantly weaker than anticipated,\" S&P Global Ratings said in a report in May.\n\nDavid's Bridal featured real-world bride influencers during Bridal Fashion Week in October 2019, including Noelle Downing, seen here. (Photo: Nina Westervelt for David's Bridal)\n\nThe ratings agency downgraded David's credit rating in the same report from B- to CCC+ with a negative outlook.\n\n\"The negative outlook reflects our view that David's Bridal is at elevated risk of failure to service its debt obligations in the long term as we expect poor customer traffic will pressure operating performance and lead to added volatility,\" S&P reported at the time.\n\nMarcum declined to discuss David's Bridal's financial position since the company is privately held, but he said he's comfortable with its current mix of about 300 stores. While \"continual refinements and relocations\" are possible since most of the leases are up for renewal within five years, he said the \"majority\" of David's Bridal stores are profitable.\n\nDigital competition ramps up\n\nDigital competition is among the key obstacles David's Bridal is facing.\n\nBrides and wedding parties are increasingly buying wedding gowns and bridesmaid dresses online, particularly from nimble start-ups that tailor their focus to niche audiences.\n\nAt start-up Birdy Grey, for instance, every bridesmaid dress is $99, and customers choose from a curated mix. Co-founded by best friends and former bridesmaids Grace Lee and Monica Ashauer, Birdy Grey offers free returns and appeals to customers through digital marketing on social media such as Instagram.\n\nBuying wedding dresses online: More brides are leaving physical stores at the altar\n\nWhat David's Bridal lacks, they said, is the perception of authenticity.\n\n\"What's helped us grow in a big way in the last few years is the authenticity of our story,\" said Lee, who serves as CEO of Birdy Grey. \"Our customers know us and that authenticity leads to brand loyalty.\" Lee said that as former bridesmaids themselves, the founders have a special connection with their customers and understand what they're looking for.\n\nBridesmaids surrounding the bride wear dresses from online start-up Birdy Grey, which specializes in $99 gowns. (Photo: Birdy Grey)\n\nAshauer said that winning over millennial brides, who are the No. 1 customer for the industry, requires understanding that they \"actually prefer to shop online.\"\n\n\"To the extent that we're digitally native, we're the anti-David's Bridal in that sense,\" she said. \"I feel like David's Bridal has been glacially in decline for the last 20 years.\"\n\nThe preference to shop online includes brides like Gabby Bowling, a Morehead State University student in Kentucky, who got married in August. She bought her dress for $157 in the spring from David's Bridal's website.\n\n\"I didn't really have time to go shopping for one,\" she said. \"I was like, if it doesn't fit and I don't really like it ... I can definitely send it back.\"\n\nUltimately, she was thrilled with the outcome. She didn't even have to do any alterations on the dress.\n\nRetail apocalypse: An estimated 12,000 shops could close by the end of 2019\n\nLower prices: David's Bridal reduces prices after surviving Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nTurning to social media\n\nTo appeal to youthful buyers like Bowling, who did wedding research on Pinterest, David's Bridal is reworking its marketing to place its emphasis on social media.\n\nPreviously, David's Bridal spent about half of its marketing budget on traditional marketing initiatives, including TV and radio. Now, it's moved it all into digital platforms, Marcum said.\n\nDavid's Bridal featured real-world bride influencers during Bridal Fashion Week in October 2019, including (l-r) Monica Bedi, Ra\u2019Chell Richards and Carrie Lane. (Photo: Nina Westervelt for David's Bridal)\n\nFor Bridal Fashion Week in New York earlier this month, the retailer didn't use traditional models in its events or promotional materials. Instead, it featured real brides who double as online influencers.\n\n\"We used real brides who were all either getting married or were about to get married, who are going through or have gone through the process, who have different looks to them \u2013 different race, ethnicity, sizes \u2013 because that\u2019s what resonates with our customer, instead of employing models who all look the same and do not feel relatable,\" said Callie Canfield Worthington, senior director of communications for David's Bridal.\n\nMarcum said a similarly \"scrappy\" and authentic feel will permeate all of the company's marketing going forward.\n\n\"We want to become relevant to today's generation, and that's where she's getting inspiration,\" Marcum said.\n\nThat mentality needs to permeate the company's physical presence, as well, said Michael Brown, a partner in the retail practice of A.T. Kearney, who has studied the future of shopping centers.\n\n\"Consumers don't just want to come into a special location like that and shop. They want to have an experience,\" he said. \"They want to have an Instagrammable moment that they can post online for their wedding party and friends and family to see.\"\n\nAs a result, the company needs to tailor its store experience to emphasize the \"emotional and celebrated experience,\" of making customers feel comfortable and welcome, Brown said.\n\nPart of making customers feel welcome is ensuring they don't feel out of place.\n\nTo appeal to everyone, David's Bridal has added larger dresses. The company now carries sizes 0-30. Prices typically range from $300 to $800 but some range up to $2,000.\n\nBowling, the Kentucky bride, said it's smart for David's Bridal to widen its scope.\n\n\"Not everybody is shaped like a tall, thin model,\" she said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/23/davids-bridal-wedding-dresses-turnaround-after-bankruptcy/4052227002/", "description": "With a new CEO on board, David's Bridal is easing returns, featuring \"real brides\" and adding sizes in a turnaround bid after surviving bankruptcy.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Published A.M.
