England defeated New Zealand to win the trophy for the first time.\n\nHowever, in the Ashes series the pugnacious left-handed opener, who with Smith has been the bulwark of the Australian batting in recent years, had his technique picked apart by Stuart Broad, bowling around the wicket with the new ball.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBroad dismissed Warner seven times in 10 innings, in which his average was 9.5. The average opening partnership was also in single figures and the highest stand a dismal 18.\n\nTo compensate for their batsmen\u2019s failures, Cummins in five tests and Hazlewood in the final four took 49 wickets between them and all the England batsmen struggled against their speed and aggression.\n\nBut at the Oval even they were showing the effects of five tests in seven weeks, which was reflected in indifferent shots and uncharacteristic dropped catches, and the team will be delighted to return home for a break before the Australian season begins.", "description": "Sustained excellence from Steve Smith, who scaled new heights with 774 runs, complemented by the searing pace and accuracy of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood enabled Australia to cling on to the Ashes despite losing the final test against England on Sunday by 135 runs.", "authors": ["John Mehaffey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430330043&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F086", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
