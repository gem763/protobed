It's quite an uncreative hack, really.\"\n\nBefore boarding her domestic Australian flight with Jetstar, Andrews also slid her laptop down the back of her stretchy jumpsuit. She'd already gone through security, so she thought it was a safe bet.\n\nShe put several layers on over the top.\n\nIt was the laptop that gave the game away -- an air steward noticed it sticking out of Andrews jacket, and she had to cough up the $60 for an overweight carry-on after all.\n\n\"Was I embarrassed? Not at all,\" says Andrews. \"I felt like a bad ass. A hot pregnant badass.\"\n\nTravel scams\n\nIt wasn't Andrews first rodeo. A frequent flier, Andrews tells CNN Travel she's \"double- and triple-layered clothes many times and have definitely done a fake pregnancy here and there.\"\n\nThis was her first time incorporating the laptop into the facade, though.\n\nAndrews refuses to feel guilty about her subterfuge.\n\n\"I think a woman has the right to do whatever she wants with her body, including faking a pregnancy made out of laptop wires,\" she says.\n\nRelated content Young man caught posing as senior citizen to fly to US\n\nAndrews used a stretchy jumpsuit to hide her belongings. Courtesy Rebecca Andrews\n\nHer only regret was that she confessed: \"I should have had a back-up story in case I was busted.\"\n\nSince she posted about the experience on Instagram , Andrews has been contacted by people across the world.\n\n\"I think it's because it's so relatable, because it's such a travel hurdle,\" she says.\n\nThere's been various similar stories circulated online in the past -- including, the Daily Mail reported, James McElvar, a boyband member who reportedly passed out from heat exhaustion from wearing every layer.", "description": "Many travelers get creative with packing, whether it's sitting on your suitcase to try and get it to shut, or arriving at the airport wearing three coats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191029113055-fake-preganancy-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
