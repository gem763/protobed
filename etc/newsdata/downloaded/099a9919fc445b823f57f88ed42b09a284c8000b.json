Obviously, I have history with Nate Diaz, we are set to have the trilogy bout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how that one goes, I feel Nate will get the better of that one and then we will contest the trilogy bout.\n\n\u201cThen I will seek the Moscow bout and it will be against the winner of Tony Ferguson and Khabib Nurmagomedov.\u201d\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nHe added: \"I need to be active, I must be active now. We have crossed a hurdle. I have a date.\n\n\"Once I am over this first one, once I am there I will continue. I have taken very little damage compared to others in the Octagon. I\u2019m eager to have a good run and compete all over the world.\"\n\nHere is a run down of 5 opponents he could face in January...\n\nDonald Cerrone\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nThe \"Cowboy\" would represent a testing but not overly outrageous challenge for McGregor's first fight back.\n\nCerrone, 36, has 12 defeats to his name in his 48 bout career, and lost his last two bouts.\n\nLast time out he was knocked out in the first round of his clash with Justin Gaethje, and was beaten inside two rounds by Tony Ferguson back in June.\n\nHe is currently ranked fifth in the lightweight division, would tick all boxes and is one of the most likely.\n\nJustin Gaethje\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nThis is a fight the fans would love to see - but it's not a great one to come straight back into after over a year out.\n\nAs mentioned, Gaethje made light work of Cerrone, which followed two other first round knockouts in his two bouts previous.\n\nGaethje would certainly prove more of a risk to McGregor - but after the Irishman slammed Nurmagomedov for running and hiding, perhaps Conor may see this as a case of no risk, no reward.\n\nMax Holloway\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nThere has been talk of a rematch between these two since McGregor won their first contest back in 2013.\n\nHolloway remains one of the only fighters to take McGregor to the judges scorecards, and now holds the featherweight championship.\n\nMcGregor has made clear his intentions to win back his lightweight belt.\n\nBut with Nurmagomedov otherwise occupied, he could go searching for gold elsewhere.\n\nDustin Poirier\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nThe suggestion of a second dust-up with Poirier keeps lingering around despite McGregor remaining adamant that it is not a fight he is interested in.\n\nMcGregor knocked out the 30-year-old in 90 seconds in 2014 - although that bout was at featherweight.\n\nPoirier looks a fresh prospect at lightweight, and it took Nurmagomedov almost three rounds to force him into submission in September.\n\nHe wants the fight, and has pushed for a rematch before his 31st birthday - which is a day after McGregor's scheduled bout.\n\nAnd he's teased McGregor, stating: \"If it\u2019s that easy [to beat me], just do it again. Try to beat your record.\"\n\nGiven that Poirier is just one spot ahead of him in the rankings, McGregor may well fancy it, particularly as it would make him no.1 contender to face his old foe Nurmagomedov again.\n\nFrankie Edgar\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\nThis fight looks almost dead and buried, after UFC president Dana White said it \"isn't going to happen\".\n\nEdgar is currently ranked fourth in the featherweight division, and therefore would offer little but way of a tune-up for McGregor.\n\nHowever it's the fight McGregor and his trainer want specifically, purely for Edgar's similarity in style to Nurmagomedov.\n\nBoth fighters tweeted just this month that they were open to the fight, though White has other plans for Edgar in the bantamweight division.\n\nBut what Conor wants, Conor usually gets...", "description": "The Irishman has laid down proposals for his 2020 season in the UFC after confirming the date of his next bout", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Martin Domin", "Image", "Stanislav Krasilnikov Tass", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713800.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mixed-martial-arts-MMA-fighter-Conor-McGregor-attends-a-news-conference-in-Moscow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
