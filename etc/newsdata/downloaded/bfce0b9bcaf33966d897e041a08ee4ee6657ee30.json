At their most basic level, the new iPhones will be better at taking photos in various conditions, are built of more durable glass that should give owners more peace of mind when using the devices without a case, and are expected to last longer on a single charge than last year's phones.\n\nBut they're just that: new phones. While they bring welcome improvements like a camera that's more skilled at seeing in the dark and can take shots from a much wider perspective, you shouldn't expect the experience to be wildly different and revolutionary. What you can expect are improvements to the core features that matter most in a smartphone, like the camera, the display, and the battery life.\n\nThe iPhone 11 starts at $700, while the iPhone 11 Pro begins at $1,000 and the base price for larger iPhone 11 Pro Max is $1,100. The phones are available to preorder and will be in stores on Friday.\n\nRead more: The iPhone 11 proves Apple learned an important lesson after last year's iPhone launch \u2014 most people don't want to pay $1,000 for a new smartphone\n\nI spent a few hours with Apple's new iPhones and came away with some first impressions.
