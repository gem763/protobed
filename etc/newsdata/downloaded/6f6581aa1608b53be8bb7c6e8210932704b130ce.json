Now the classic diamond pattern is having a Generation Z moment\n\nA different view on an established classic is a familiar trick in fashion \u2013 take shoulder-robing your coat or french-tucking a shirt, for example. And consider argyle: the diamond pattern came into being by looking at something another way \u2013 in this case, tartan in the 17th century.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest London fashion week 2019, from left: Victoria Beckham, Molly Goddard and Gucci.

They worked out that if you cut the fabric once it is woven on the bias, it gives it a certain elasticity. So by turning tartan on its side you get argyle.\u201d\n\nArgyle\u2019s diamond pattern \u2013 those squares of tartan turned 90 degrees \u2013 is a classic, but it\u2019s emerging as a jumper of choice this winter. It appeared in various guises on the catwalk. It was seen at Gucci (a bit Wes Anderson), Victoria Beckham (smart, put-together), Molly Goddard (a relaxed fawn and emerald cardigan), Chlo\u00e9 (graphic, a bit conceptual) and Polo Ralph Lauren (classic preppy). There are affordable options, too, ranging from Marks & Spencer to Stussy and Ami.\n\nFor many, Pringle \u201cowns\u201d argyle. The Scottish label has produced it since the 1920s, and is famous for dressing the Duke of Windsor. Now, though, argyle\u2019s fashion moment is attracting a very different kind of fan. The brand recently launched Pringle Reissued, a Generation Z-targeted range that features Lennon Gallagher, Jess Maybury and Palace model Lucien Clarke in the ad campaign. That street-style take on argyle, says Pringle\u2019s creative director, Fran Stringer, \u201cis in the air. Burberry brought back the bucket hat and the check,\u201d she says, adding that the collection was inspired by argyle from the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nIf the 90s is one influence on Generation Z, so is a slightly fogey-ish tweedy look that Hugo Harris, senior manager of Beyond Retro, the online vintage store, pegs to many Generation Z-ers watching The Crown. \u201cI think the idea of heritage and tradition is coming back,\u201d he says. \u201cDesigners are referencing the idea of traditional dress from country walks to royals or the idea of \u2018punk.\u2019 With The Crown pulling the royal family\u2019s past back into the present, this has had a huge social impact.\u201d You don\u2019t need the budget of a Windsor, though \u2013 the vintage site\u2019s countless argyles all come at less than \u00a330.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Argyle sweaters, from left: Pringle Reissued, Marks & Spencer Collection and AMI.

That is why it chimes perfectly with a generation that likes nothing more than picking and choosing references and putting them together. Stringer\u2019s moodboard for the Reissued collection featured images of Begbie from Trainspotting and 80s football casuals wearing designer labels. The casuals would have picked up on those sweaters from golf \u2013 a sport associated with the well-off and a lifestyle that was perhaps seen as aspirational for a largely working-class demographic. Pringle collaborated with Nick Faldo in the 80s on a range so popular that, by the end of the decade, the brand was producing 10,000 sweaters a week \u2013 Stringer points out that these originals can now be picked up on eBay.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Golfer Nick Faldo in argyle, 1987.

Like the Harrington jacket (which hails from Manchester), argyle was made in the UK, popularised in the US and sold back to Britain with American allure. O\u2019Neill points to argyle at Brooks Brothers in the 50s, with shops at Harvard and Yale universities. By the 90s, the preppy dresser was gently mocked by characters such as Carlton Banks in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Cher Horowitz in Clueless, both of whom wore argyle.\n\nBut if preppy style was the preserve of rich kids, such as Banks and Horowitz, it has also been part of hip-hop culture since the 80s. Young people of colour, typically from poorer US urban centres were, like the casuals, subverting an elite classic. Eric Arnold, a hip-hop historian and consultant on Oakland Museum\u2019s 2018 exhibition Respect: Hip-Hop Style & Wisdom, describes the look as the contrast between a \u201csort of the Brett Kavanaugh reality\u201d, in which preppy was traditionally seen to belong, and that of groups such as the Lo-Lifes, the Polo Ralph Lauren obsessives in Brooklyn, New York City, who would often steal clothes from department stores. \u201cThey had a degree of street credibility which is out of reach for an average prep school student,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt was this tradition that saw Andre 3000 and Kanye West circa The College Drop Out album wearing argyle in the mid-00s.\u201d\n\nArgyle could well enjoy a new moment in music soon, too \u2013 Khalid wore an argyle sweater for a gig this year, and you could imagine an argyle sweater being included in Tyler the Creator\u2019s alt-preppy GOLF le FLEUR collection. \u201cArgyle has been adopted by so many different subcultures and so many different classes,\u201d says Stringer. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think it is so loved in Britain \u2013 it\u2019s a royalty to rebellion item.\u201d", "description": "Since it was invented in the 17th century, argyle has been worn by everyone from royals to Kanye West and Nick Faldo.
