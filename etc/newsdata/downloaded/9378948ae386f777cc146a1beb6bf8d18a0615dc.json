On April 11th, 2017, we wrote a song called \u201cHealthy\u201d w/ Lizzo, Jesse St John, and Yves Rothman at our studio.\n\n\u2018\u201cI just took a DNA test turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch\u201d was taken from \u201cHealthy\u201d and used in \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d.\n\n\u2018We were never contacted about being credited for the use of the parts of \u201cHealthy\u201d (melody, lyrics, and chords) that appear in \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo\u2019s team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years, only asking for 5% each but were shutdown every time.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Coming forward publicly to family, friends, artists, and colleagues seems to be the only way at this point in relieving some of our emotional distress caused by this.\n\n\u2018The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure.\n\n\u2018If we believe in what she\u2019s preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she\u2019d understand.\u2019\n\nJustin\u2019s case is the second time Lizzo has been accused of taking the \u2018DNA test\u2019 line, as British singer Mina Lioness tweeted Lizzo last year, claiming she had written the line.\n\nLizzo has yet to respond to the claims (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nShe wrote: \u2018Everyone believes those were your words, when in fact they were mine. My creativity, my wit and my comedy.\u2019\n\nJustin added: \u2018Shout out to the singer Mina Lioness ( @minalioness ) for tweeting \u201cI just did a DNA test turns out I\u2019m 100% that b***h\u201d.\n\n\u2018A meme of that came up in our writing session & inspired the lyric and melody we wrote together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If Ricky and Lizzo\u2019s team decide to settle this dispute with us, we would like to share some of the proceeds with Mina for her influence on Healthy.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has reached out to Lizzo\u2019s team for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
