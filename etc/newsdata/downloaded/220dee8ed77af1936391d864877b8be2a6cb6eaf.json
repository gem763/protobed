It\u2019s Getting Harder to Tell the Difference", "language": "en", "text": "In the middle of a family crisis, Aishetu Fatima Dozie, a Harvard Business School graduate, decided to call her executive coach. The two had grown close, and it wasn\u2019t unusual for personal matters to come up during sessions. The conversation made her feel better, but apparently it crossed a line.\n\nThe next time they spoke, she says her coach told her, \u201cThat was a one-off. I\u2019m not your therapist.\u201d Ms. Dozie, who was working for a South African bank then and who has since founded a cosmetics e-commerce startup in the Bay Area, was disappointed she couldn\u2019t have what she saw as a two-in-one counselor. \u201cI liked it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut she clearly thought this was not what we should be doing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a certain appeal to having a Wendy Rhodes in your life. The psychiatrist from Showtime\u2019s \u201cBillions\u201d helps hedge-fund employees crush it while also uncovering the deeper roots of their feelings, thoughts and behaviors. (Was that last deal motivated by potential gain\u2026or by personal spite?)\n\nIn real life, coaches are especially prevalent in tech. There are various reasons for this, according to people in the industry. Starting a company can be all-consuming and isolating. Startups can grow rapidly, and founders aren\u2019t always ready for the highs and lows and the massive workload involved.\n\nStartup founders have shared their struggles, including mental-health issues. Andy Cook, founder of Tettra, a software startup, recently floated on Twitter the idea of venture-capital firms offering in-house therapists. He decided to see one after ending an engagement and says it helped his work life.\n\n\u201cIn the tech industry, you have to project this aura of, I have it under control,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge stigma around going to see a therapist and it\u2019s almost like admitting you can\u2019t handle your own mental state,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s easier for people to go see a coach because that\u2019s more accepted.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you used an executive coach? If so, how personal do you get? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe overlap between coaching and therapy has always been there, some coaches say. But others say that in recent years, the lines are getting blurrier.\n\nAs long as coaches aren\u2019t treating addiction, diagnosing mental-health disorders or working clients through abuse or trauma, they\u2019re within bounds, some in the industry say. Others caution that coaching is straying too far into the territory of mental health\u2014and that\u2019s a problem. Not only is there a lack of regulation in coaching, the coach-client relationship isn\u2019t a legally protected one.\n\nNonetheless, some people who would shun a \u201ctherapist\u201d would gladly schedule regular visits with a \u201ccoach\u201d due to common perceptions that therapy is only focused on processing the past and is reserved for people with mental-health issues.\n\nJulie Gurner, an executive coach in New York City, is trained as a psychologist, though she doesn\u2019t have a license to practice and intentionally stays away from anything that might look like therapy. She says clients tell her sometimes about issues they have been working on with previous coaches, such as cutting back on the use of certain drugs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s not an issue that person should be addressing.\u2019\u201d\n\nKara Nortman, a partner with the venture-capital firm Upfront Ventures in Los Angeles, says in her experience, it\u2019s not uncommon for founders and others in the tech sector to use their coach as a de facto therapist.\n\nMs. Nortman herself worked with a coach on managing acute emotional reactions she was having in certain work situations, such as difficulty accepting feedback. She says when she has suggested to friends who work in senior tech positions to go to therapy she has met resistance, but she can usually convince them to see a coach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a badge of honor to have a coach,\u201d she says.\n\nThe coach-therapist hybrid has become an appealing option. Some psychologists have been adding coaching to their services in recent years, or making the switch entirely. Conversely, some coaches who don\u2019t have formal psychological training see their work as bridging the gap between therapy and coaching.\n\nThe nonprofit International Coach Federation, has a code of ethics and put out its first-ever guidelines last year on when and how a coach should suggest a client seek help from a mental-health professional. \u201cWe frequently would hear coaches asking, \u2018I don\u2019t know when to refer someone to therapy,\u2019\u201d says Joel DiGirolamo, director of coaching science with the ICF.\n\nKelley Amadei, an executive coach who splits her time between New York and San Francisco and who has worked in human resources and corporate leadership, says the traditional, more tactical style of coaching\u2014one that didn\u2019t take into account the whole person\u2014just didn\u2019t work that well.\n\nAs an executive at Heineken, Ms. Amadei evaluated the effectiveness of the coaches, both internal and external, that the company paid for. \u201cThere was a very particular formula that was used,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people weren\u2019t making significant step change in performance, in delivery, in self awareness or in behavior.\u201d\n\nMs. Amadei\u2019s current practice combines Buddhist psychology, organizational and individual psychology and discussion of business goals. She asks deeply personal questions, including about her clients\u2019 childhoods and significant events that shaped them. People joke about her being an unlicensed therapist.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, that\u2019s true,\u201d she says. \u201cTherapy as a paradigm is broad. Coaching as a paradigm can be broad. And we\u2019ve put them in really small boxes and decided they are separate.\u201d\n\nTransparency is key, she says. This means being upfront about her training and experience. She doesn\u2019t treat addiction, diagnose mental-health disorders or work with clients on resolving trauma, or abuse. She might share general feedback with a client\u2019s employer but won\u2019t get into any details about sessions without a client\u2019s permission. One company declined to hire her as a result.\n\nKenneth Berger, an executive coach in San Francisco, draws similar boundaries.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to diagnose anxiety. I can only use anxiety in the colloquial sense,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018What are you noticing about the way you\u2019re thinking about this? The way you\u2019re feeling about this?\u2019 Then we have the opportunity to bring that in toward their vision, where they want to go, their values.\u201d\n\nHowever, his clients are welcome to talk about any aspects of their lives. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are complex and what\u2019s happening at home is happening at work,\u201d he says. While he uses tools similar to those of cognitive behavioral therapy, he says he applies them differently and views his work as fundamentally distinct from therapy.\n\nCameron Yarbrough, a licensed therapist and founder of the coaching startup Torch, says coaching might make more people more willing to try therapy, but that a huge negative is the lack of regulations surrounding coach confidentiality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very common for coaches to have loose lips,\u201d says Mr. Yarbrough. \u201cI have seen really ugly examples of executive coaches oversharing content to boards of directors, to co-founders, to unrelated parties\u2014confidential and sensitive information.\u201d\n\nLesly Higgins, an executive coach in the Bay Area, says when a client comes to her with a personal issue that\u2019s affecting work, she asks herself, \u201cDo I have the skills and training to be effective, and is it appropriate based on who\u2019s hired me to do this work?\u201d\n\nWhen one client was debating leaving a company to seek an M.B.A. or pursue other opportunities, Ms. Higgins felt advising on those issues presented a potential conflict of interest as the client\u2019s employer was paying her bill. But if a client is going through a divorce or dealing with the effects of fertility treatments, she might guide them on strategies for how to remain productive at work while experiencing those issues.\n\nOne of her clients was a senior tech executive contemplating a new, high-paying job as his company was being acquired. Through work with his therapist and Ms. Higgins, he determined his career decisions had always been based on how much money he made. That\u2019s how his parents measured success.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I realized in our work together that the very first time I made a million dollars, the first thing I did was send a copy of my W-2 to my dad,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nIn the end, he decided to forgo the high-paying position to join a startup, a job with less prestige and certainty but one he thought would make him happier.\n\n\u2014\u201cKeywords\u201d columnist Christopher Mims is on book leave.", "description": "Having your own Wendy Rhodes can be a badge of honor, but as lines blur some see problems.
