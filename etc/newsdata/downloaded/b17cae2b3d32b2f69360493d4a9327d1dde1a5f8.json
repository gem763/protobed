That was the law which required him to write the extension letter if parliament had not approved either a deal or a no-deal exit by Oct. 19.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners had asked the court earlier this month for it either to issue an order forcing Johnson to ask for a delay or for it to instruct that a letter be sent to the EU on his behalf if he refused.\n\nThe campaigners also said he should face penalties including a fine or even prison if he did not comply with the Benn Act.\n\nThe court, has not yet ruled on the matter and was waiting to do so pending developments up to Oct. 19. But it said this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements - averments - that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not.\n\n\"It would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,\" judge Paul Cullen, known as Lord Pentland, said.\n\nOpposition lawmakers said that by writing two letters, Johnson had broken his government's pledge to the court not to frustrate the legislation.\n\n\"He may well be in contempt of parliament or the courts themselves because he's clearly trying to undermine the first letter,\" Labour's finance spokesman John McDonnell told Sky News.\n\nLabour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer told BBC television Johnson was \"being childlike\", adding \"I am sure there will be court proceedings\".\n\n\n\n\n\nTUESDAY? BREXIT LEGISLATION\n\nJohnson told parliament that \"next week the government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31\". It is widely expected to have its first main stage of debate on Tuesday.\n\nSenior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday the government would seek to get the legislation required through parliament in order to get Brexit done and leave the EU on Oct. 31. Gove and foreign minister Dominic Raab said they believed the government had the numbers to pass a deal.\n\nFormer minister Amber Rudd, who quit the government over Johnson's willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit, said she and most of the 21 Conservative lawmakers who were kicked out of the parliamentary party for backing attempts to block a no-deal exit, would support the legislation.\n\n\"He has a fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it,\" she told Sky News.\n\nLawmakers will have the opportunity to bring changes to the legislation and Labour's Starmer and McDonnell said on Sunday the party would put forward amendments including on issues such as protecting worker's rights and closing the \"trap door\" to a no-deal Brexit at the end of a transition period in December 2020.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sent an unsigned letter to the European Union requesting a delay to Britain's exit from the bloc, as well as a second note saying he did not want a \"deeply corrosive\" Brexit extension.
