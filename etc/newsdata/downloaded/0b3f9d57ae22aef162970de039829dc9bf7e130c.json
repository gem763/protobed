Her free throw percent of 97.4 is a record for a player with at least 100 attempts.\n\nThe Mystics (26-8), who lost to Seattle in the finals last year), have a double-bye into the semifinals and home court advantage throughout the playoffs. The Sky (20-14) are the No. 5 seed and play No. 8 Phoenix at home on Wednesday in the single-elimination opening round of the playoffs.\n\nChicago\u2019s Courtney Vandersloot had six assists to become the first player in league history to reach 300 in a season, which she did exactly, and the first player to average at least nine assists a game for a season (9.1).\n\nACES 98, MERCURY 89\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Liz Cambage had 21 points and A\u2019ja Wilson scored eight of her 20 points in the final three-plus minutes to help the Aces beat the Mercury, clinching the No. 4 seed in the playoffs for Las Vegas.\n\nThe Aces, who missed the playoffs each of the last four years earned a bye in Wednesday\u2019s first round and will host a second-round game on Sept. 15.\n\nWilson hit a jumper to tie the game at 89 and spark an 11-0 closing run by Las Vegas (21-13) as the Mercury went 0 for 5 from the field and committed three turnovers over the final three minutes.\n\nBrittney Griner led Phoenix (15-19) with 24 points.\n\nSTORM 78, WINGS 64\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Natasha Howard and Jewell Loyd combined to score 30 of their 38 points in the first half and the Storm beat the Wings, helping Seattle clinch the No. 6 seed in the playoffs.\n\nThe Storm, the defending champions, will host No. 7 seed Minnesota in a single-elimination first-round game on Wednesday. The Lynx lost at Los Angeles and the Storm have the tiebreaker between the two teams.\n\nSeattle has won three in a row overall, and four straight at home, against the Lynx.\n\nArike Ogunbowale led the Wings (10-24) with 25 points to finish the season with 630, the third-highest rookie scoring total in WNBA history.\n\nSPARKS 77, LYNX 68\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Riquna Williams hit four 3-pointers and finished with 15 points to help the Sparks beat Minnesota, ruining the Lynx\u2019s chance of hosting a playoff game in the first round.\n\nThe Sparks (22-12) have a first-round bye in the playoffs, which begin on Wednesday and will host the worst remaining seed in the second round.\n\nThe Lynx (18-16), who had a five-game win streak snapped, will be the No. 7 seed because of their loss and Seattle\u2019s win over Dallas.

They have the second best chance to get the No. 1 pick in the draft lottery.\n\nThe Sun (23-11), locked into the No. 2 seed and a double-bye in the playoffs, played their starters less than half the game.\n\nRookie Teaira McCowan added 17 points and nine rebounds. She finished with 304 rebounds on the season, breaking Erlana Larkins\u2019 2014 franchise record by one.\n\nLIBERTY 71 DREAM 63\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Tina Charles scored 14 points, Amanda Zahui B. added a double-double and the Liberty topped the Dream.\n\nThe Liberty (10-24) had an 18-11 advantage in the third quarter to stretch a 44-38 halftime lead to 63-49 and was never seriously challenged by the Dream (8-26).\n\nAtlanta gave a ceremonial start to injured forward Angel McCoughtry, who has been sidelined for the season while recovering from a knee injury she suffered last year.
