(Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press)\n\nIndigenous voters turned out in record numbers for the federal election in 2015. Data analysis showed that the Liberals picked up most of the new voters, while the NDP remained the party of choice for First Nations voters living on-reserve. During the summer, a poll commissioned by CBC News suggested that dissatisfaction among Indigenous voters would result in a significant drop in First Nations' votes cast for the Liberals this time around.\n\nTo discuss the issues that matter to Indigenous voters, and what losing their support might mean for the federal parties, Lynch spoke to:\n\nLiana Wolf Leg, a member of the Siksika Nation in southern Alberta, who works for the Reconciliation Pipeline. She is undecided as to how she will vote on Oct. 21.\n\nDave Randall, a pulp and paper worker in B.C. Randall is Indigenous and says he plans to vote Conservative.\n\nVeldon Coburn, an Anishinaabe professor at the University of Ottawa's Institute of Indigenous Research and Studies. He says he will be voting for the NDP.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
