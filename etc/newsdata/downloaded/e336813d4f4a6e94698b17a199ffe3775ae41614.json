This divergence could be coming into play as U.S. corporations deal with the effects of rising import tariffs on trade between U.S. and China, according to a Wednesday analysis by Goldman Sachs Investment Research.\n\nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\nThe gross output of manufactured gods comprised just 29.3% of U.S. GDP in 2018, but goods-producing firms make up 44% of the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.72% market capitalization, according to Goldman. These firms have underperformed relative to services firms since January of 2018, when the Trump administration launched its \u201cSection 301\u201d investigation of Chinese trade practices, which has been used to justify broad-based tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nRead more: Here are the stocks to buy if an all-out U.S.-China trade war erupts, says Goldman\n\nSo far, the overall U.S. economy has shown resilience in the face of new trade barriers. GDP has advanced 3.1% in the first quarter and 2% in the second, a bit slower pace than the 2.9% growth seen last year, but in line with the 2017 expansion. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to create more than enough jobs to keep up with population growth and consumer spending remains strong.\n\nThe stock market, however, has performed less impressively over the past 20 months, up about 3.7% from its January 2018 high, and there\u2019s reason to believe trade concerns share the blame for some of this, given the outperformance of services stocks during that period.\n\nGoldman Sachs Global Investment Research\n\nTorsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, expressed concern rising tariffs may impact the corporate sector, with slowing capital investment ranking as the number one concern. He predicted it will continue worsen in coming months given the steady rise in tariff rates and the breadth of goods covered, as well as survey data showing businesses slowing their hiring plans. \u201cWe are continuously escalating [tariffs] and coming to a level where the intensity of the trade war has become worrying,\u201d he said in a Tuesday analysis.\n\nDeutsche Bank Securities", "description": "The gross output of manufactured goods made up just 29.3% of U.S. GDP in 2018, but goods-producing firms make up 44% of the S&P 500 index market...", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP423_econ_i_ZG_20180904095541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
