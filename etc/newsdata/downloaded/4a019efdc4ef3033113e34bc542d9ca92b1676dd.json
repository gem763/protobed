The U.S. capital is hosting its first World Series since 1933.\n\nTrump did not throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the game, as many previous presidents have done. That task fell instead to celebrity chef Jose Andres, who founded a non-profit group to feed disaster victims around the world.\n\nAndres also canceled plans to run a restaurant in Trump\u2019s Washington hotel because of Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about Mexicans, which led to a legal settlement.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump was greeted with boos and a smattering of chants of \"Lock him up!\" when he appeared on screen at the World Series in Washington on Sunday, even as he celebrated one of the biggest wins of his administration.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445711164&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R03V", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
