It also suggests that lawmakers are not mollified by the deal that Vice President Mike Pence struck with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to halt hostilities in the region.\n\nThe president could waive the sanctions for up to 90 days at a time after certifying to Congress that Turkey is upholding the cease-fire.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has let Erdogan off scot-free,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel said on the House floor. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Congress to act to make it clear where the American government stands.\u201d\n\nThe bill \u201cincentivizes Turkey to comply with the cease-fire,\u201d said Michael McCaul, the top Foreign Affairs Republican and co-sponsor of the bill with Engel. \u201cIf they do not, there will be consequences in the form of crippling sanctions.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch said his committee soon may consider a similar bill he introduced along with top committee Democrat Bob Menendez, although the meeting hasn\u2019t been scheduled yet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working at that feverishly,\u201d Risch said. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats are singing off the same sheet of music on this.\u201d\n\nThe bill, H.R. 4695, would sanction senior Turkish officials and prohibit them from entering the U.S. It would also prohibit the transfer of U.S. defense materiel to Turkey for use in Syria, and it would require the Pentagon and State Department to submit plans to prevent the resurgence of Islamic State.\n\nIt would sanction Halkbank, a state-owned bank, as well as other financial institutions determined to have facilitated transactions that helped finance the invasion. It would also require the administration to impose sanctions already mandated over the purchase by Turkey of a Russian-made missile-defense system.\n\nIf the Senate passes an alternative version, the two bills would have to be reconciled before being sent to Trump.\n\nEngel of New York and McCaul of Texas introduced the House bill earlier this month amid bipartisan opposition to the troop withdrawal that left the Kurds vulnerable to attacks from Turkey, which had grown increasingly suspicious of Kurdish autonomy in neighboring Syria.\n\nThe House on Oct. 16 adopted a symbolic resolution by a 354-60 vote to disapprove of the U.S. withdrawal and to call on Erdogan to \u201cimmediately cease unilateral military action\u201d in the region. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confronted Trump in a closed-door White House meeting about his strategy in the region and cited the resolution as proof that his own party didn\u2019t support his Syria policy.\n\nPence and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo were sent to Ankara shortly thereafter to negotiate a temporary halt to the Turkish military campaign. Trump later declared the effort a success, converting it to a \u201cpermanent\u201d cease-fire in northern Syria. At the same time, Erdogan said he had reached a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border.\n\nTrump\u2019s Syria envoy, James Jeffrey, told three congressional committees last week that removing troops from the region would make the fight against ISIS more difficult.\n\n\u201cIf you remove those troops before that mission is complete, then you have a problem,\u201d Jeffrey told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cAnd we do have a problem right now.\u201d\n\nIn announcing Baghdadi\u2019s death Sunday, Trump said eliminating the terrorist leader would have no bearing on his plans to withdraw troops from the area.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill Tuesday threatening to sanction Turkey, warning that a deal struck with the Trump administration won\u2019t necessarily save the NATO ally from economic punishment for its military operation in northern Syria.The bill to sanction Turkish", "authors": ["Daniel Flatley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JZvgQh.H9023XZFaOs.1gw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/584a60582e8ef6f11eb152890db5dd84", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
