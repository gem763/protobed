It has finally exhumed the remains of General Francisco Franco from the mausoleum near Madrid where the country\u2019s emeritus king had the dictator buried.\n\nFranco\u2019s monument \u2013 built in large part with the slave labour of civil war prisoners, many of whom ended up in an unmarked grave \u2013 stands at one end of his regime\u2019s monstrous legacy. The assassinated poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, whose body has never been found, is sometimes regarded as representing the other. Spain is thought to have the highest number of disappeared people out of any country in the world, bar Cambodia.\n\nIn spite of this, a citizen-driven project to revive the memory of the missing, which began at the turn of the millennium, eventually forced legislation in 2007 that provided funding for excavation, reburial and commemoration. These organisations have been defunded by consecutive Popular Party governments, denying closure to thousands of families.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

What is referred to by academics as \u201csociological Francosim\u201d has established long roots, over the course of decades, in a reciprocal process of privilege safeguarding elites who thrived under the dictatorship.\n\nAs MP Alberto Garz\u00f3n explains \u201cMany of the judges in Spain today are the children of parents who were judges in the era of Franco \u2026 the heads and directors of Spain\u2019s national newspapers were those who had been propaganda chiefs during the Franco years \u2026 [people] forget big business\u2019 ties with Francoism\u201d.\n\nThe continuity of this legacy has its origins in the political compromises of the 1978 Transition and can be clearly seen today in the discursive instincts of the Spanish Right when, in particular, the national question rears its head. As Spanish journalist Antonio Maestre puts it, these \u201cdirect inheritors\u201d of Francoism are \u201cstill today beating their political adversaries over the head with national symbols,\u201d preventing any clear consensus being reached on the past. So long as this is the case, the issue of historical memory is liable to be turned into an endless political football.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s centre-left Socialist Party first announced its plans to dig up Spain\u2019s former dictator almost 18 months ago. Since then, the proposals have hit a number of road blocks, facing opposition from the Catholic Church and the Franco family itself. Eventually, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favour of the move.\n\nRemoving Franco from the Valley of the Fallen will be considered a significant electoral coup for S\u00e1nchez, as the acting prime minister attempts to shift the focus of the national debate away from the last 10 days of protests and rioting in Catalonia \u2013 the impact of which he appears to have underestimated.\n\nSpain\u2019s right-wing opposition has repeatedly accused S\u00e1nchez of \u201coccupying power\u201d with his provisional administration marked by legislative gridlock, meaning the country has not had a new budget since 2017. This move, along with other pledges he has promised to implement during the coming weeks, sees S\u00e1nchez taking more governmental action during the campaign than he has done for months, setting out his stall as the candidate of stability \u2013 while rattling the Francoist skeletons in the face of his right-wing opponents \u2013 for November\u2019s general election.\n\nAnd here lies the danger. As is the case with the confrontations over Catalonia, the thorny issue of historical memory can not simply be a campaigning \u201cvote-winner\u201d for an acting prime minister who has been coasting for much of the previous 18 months in office. Although polling and sentiment on the ground indicates the exhumation is now a less politically-sensitive issue than it used to be, any move like this has to be more than a symbolic gesture. This is particularly true at a time when the Catalan question has re-energised the far-right forces that were defeated in April\u2019s national ballot.\n\nS\u00e1nchez has already backtracked on initial plans to convert the Valley of the Fallen into a reconciliation centre dedicated to the victims of the civil war, as part of a broader \u201cresignification\u201d project envisaged for the site. His government has also failed to strip the notorious Franco-era police officer, \u2018Billy the Kid\u2019, of his state honours for alleged crimes committed during the dictatorship.\n\nBeyond that, too, is the longer-term task of establishing a clear consensus on Spain\u2019s recent past that can form a basis for public life going forward (this also demands something of the country\u2019s political right).\n\nThis exhumation marks a significant step forward for post-Transition Spain in symbolic terms, but Franco\u2019s removal can not be simply reduced to cheap electioneering. If the various elements underlying this edifice and what it represents are not properly addressed and examined, they will rear their ugly heads again \u2013 some, indeed, argue they never went away.", "description": "More than 40 years after its return to democracy, Spain\u2019s government is broaching a totemic issue.
