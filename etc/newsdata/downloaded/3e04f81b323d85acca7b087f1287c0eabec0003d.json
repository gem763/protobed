Now she has been honoured by the country, but the bigger honour is probably that the child has been named after her.\n\nReportedly, the Indonesian baby boy delivered by Lance Corporal Komathi Narayanan has been named Rizky Sardi Mathi-varna.\n\nCheras police chief ACP Mohamed Mokhsein Mohamed Zon also honoured 27-year-old Komathi with certificates of appreciation and plaques. The 43-year-old taxi driver, Wong Kok Loong who drove Komathi and the pregnant mother to the hospital, was also present.\n\n\n\n\n\nMohamed Mokhsein reportedly gave a speech where he acknowledged both Komathi and Wong as heroes, who went beyond their duty.\n\nOn October 7, the police officer of Indian origin was reportedly on duty at the Bandar Tasik Selatan (TBS) bus terminal's police beat and she was approached by the pregnant woman whose water had broken.\n\nKomathi tried to help the woman, and after three cabs refused to ferry them, Wong agreed. The woman went into labour in the backseat of the taxi and Komathi helped with the birth.\n\nDon't Miss 22.4 K SHARES 9 K SHARES 8.5 K SHARES 6.3 K SHARES 4.5 K SHARES\n\n\n\n\n\nHer uniform was soiled in blood and other fluids but she was not bothered by that.
