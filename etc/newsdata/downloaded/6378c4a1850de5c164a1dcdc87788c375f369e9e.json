Studies in America have found that a combined use of dash cams and 'accelerometers' \u2013 which record the high G-forces created when a car is driven erratically or dangerously \u2013 reduces bad driving, if young novices know the information will be shared with their mum and dad.\n\n'Fortunately, there is a proven solution which can deliver this, graduated driver licensing.'\n\nThe GDL scheme would demand all new motorists to have a 12-month learner period, an initial test, and then a two-year novice period when drivers can drive independently but with restrictions \u2013 such as a late-night driving curfew.\n\nMinisters announced in the recent Road Safety Action Plan that they will explore the issue of Graduated Driver Licensing further in a bid to cut new driver crashes.\n\n'The Government's announcement that they will explore the issue of GDL further is welcome,' added Harris.\n\n'Swift and decisive action must, however, be taken to introduce GDL across the UK, as a priority to ensure new drivers have the skills and experience they need and to end the tragedy of young people dying on our roads.'", "description": "Under the New Drivers Act, anyone who racks up more than 6 penalty points within 2 years of passing their test will automatically have their licence revoked.
