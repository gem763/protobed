We should level down not up. \u201d\n\nI get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one. The answer isn't for X to get more; it's for both of them to get less (or even none!!!) We should level down not up. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nAmericans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up. Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nMany were outraged over what they saw as a light sentence for Huffman, which pales in contrast to other people of color who are poor and received harsher punishments for lesser crimes.\n\nHuffman, 56, is the first parent to be sentenced in a nationwide college admissions scam involving wealthy parents paying large sums to help get their sons or daughters into prestigious schools.\n\nThe \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d actor pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud for paying $15,000 to raise her daughter\u2019s SAT score. A federal judge sentenced Huffman to 14 days in prison, with a supervised release for one year and 250 hours of community service. She also has to pay a fine of $30,000. Prosecutors suggested Huffman serve one month in prison.\n\nHuffman\u2019s sentencing drew comparisons to cases involving a Texas woman who is facing up to five years in prison for casting a vote and a homeless woman who served five years for sending her son to a public school in a district they didn\u2019t live in.\n\nIn 2016, Crystal Mason voted using a provisional ballot in Texas while she was on supervised release for a federal felony. She said she didn\u2019t know she was ineligible to vote and while her ballot was rejected, a district attorney still pressed charges against her. Tanya McDowell, a homeless woman, was sentenced to five years in prison after she sent her son to a public school in a district they didn\u2019t live in.\n\nLegend said Mason and McDowell\u2019s cases were shameful and \u201cunconscionable,\u201d and said that they shouldn\u2019t have been imprisoned at all.\n\n\u201cPrisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we\u2019ve come to use them to address nearly every societal ill,\u201d the singer tweeted.\n\nIt's insane we locked a woman up for 5 years for sending her kid to the wrong school district. Literally everyone involved in that decision should be ashamed of themselves \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nIt's unconscionable that we locked a woman up for voting when, unbeknownst to her, she was ineligible. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nHer sentence shouldn't be fewer years. It should be ZERO. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nWhile people were angered that Huffman\u2019s sentencing wasn\u2019t longer, Legend believes she shouldn\u2019t have received any time at all.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cNo one in our nation will benefit for cheating in college admissions. We don\u2019t need to lock people up for any of this stuff.\u201d\n\nAnd no one in our nation will benefit from the 14 days an actress will serve for cheating in college admissions. We don't need to lock people up for any of this stuff. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 14, 2019\n\nLegend has used his celebrity status to advocate for criminal justice reform. Last week, he attended an \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d town hall event filmed at New York\u2019s Sing Sing prison to talk about mass incarceration and the toll of life behind bars with inmates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was offended that his administration\u2019s criminal justice reform efforts were not specifically mentioned during the event, and called Legend an \u201cold boring musician.\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?
