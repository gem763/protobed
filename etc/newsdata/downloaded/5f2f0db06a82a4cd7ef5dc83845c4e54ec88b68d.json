That fact can be easily forgotten when it comes to seemingly abstract concepts like \u201cenergy.\u201d As the climate change crisis worsens, more politicians are starting to underscore the importance of transitioning to clean energy. More clean energy means more solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and large-scale batteries. But it also means more demand for the materials that make those technologies possible.\n\nIn some cases (like silicon for solar panels), higher demand is unlikely to be an issue. Silicon is plentiful and we already have the infrastructure to make the material, according to Marco Raugei, an expert in the sustainability of new technology at Oxford Brookes University. But our supply chains for other materials \u2014 like neodymium for wind turbines, lithium and cobalt for batteries, and copper for basically everything \u2014 may need to shift.\n\nThough ore demand for materials usually means more mining (and with it, increased environmental impacts), experts agree that the benefits of renewable energy far outweigh the costs. \u201cThere is no such thing as a free lunch,\u201d says Charles Barnhart, a professor of energy studies at Western Washington University. \u201cBut I want to be clear that when we talk about environmental impacts, we\u2019re not trying to decide between \u2018lesser evils.\u2019\u201d For Barnhart, deciding between more mining for renewables and continuing to rely on fossil fuels is deciding between \u201ccompletely different sides of the spectrum\u201d because the cost of a business-as-usual future with fossil fuels will cause so much harm.\n\nEven though the trade-off will be beneficial, it\u2019s worth thinking about where the materials for the anticipated renewables revolution will come from and how the world will change when demand goes up.\n\nNEODYMIUM\n\n\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything to compete with neodymium for magnets,\u201d says Frances Wall, a professor of applied mineralogy at the University of Exeter\u2019s Camborne School of Mines. \u201cThey\u2019re just by far the best for the application.\u201d Neodymium is a so-called rare earth element, a silvery metal with a very important role in renewable energy. When combined with iron and boron, it makes strong magnets that are important both for generators in wind turbines and motors in electric vehicles.\n\nDespite the name, rare earth elements like neodymium aren\u2019t particularly rare, Wall explains. The elements are relatively abundant. Some are found in the same concentration in Earth\u2019s crust as the far more pedestrian-sounding element copper. The challenge is that neodymium is very much controlled by a single country. About 85 percent of the world\u2019s neodymium comes out of a few mines in China. One mine called Baotou in northern China has created a toxic lake and other environmental horrors. There are a few small mines elsewhere \u2014 like the Rainbow Rare Earths mine in Burundi and the Mkango mine in Malawi \u2014 but oftentimes, even mines outside of China tend to send their deposits to China to process. That\u2019s the case with the Mountain Pass rare Earth mine in California.\n\nOne huge bottleneck for neodymium mining and processing is funding. \u201cThere were loads of rare earth exploration projects and what happens is they gradually just slow down if they don\u2019t get investments into the next stage,\u201d explains Wall. As demand increases, Wall predicts that other suppliers will come into the market, and there will be room for more mines to open up.\n\nCOPPER\n\nLike neodymium, copper isn\u2019t scarce, but we need a lot of it. Basically anything that has an on-off switch includes copper, thanks to its incredible ability to conduct electricity, and we haven\u2019t found a better alternative yet.\n\nThe tricky part about copper extraction is finding areas where the metal is concentrated in large enough amounts that are close to the surface, says Mary Poulton, co-director of the Lowell Institute for Mineral Resources at the University of Arizona. It can be difficult to find large deposits in the first place, and then it can take ages to get permits and actually start production. \u201cFor the most part, we\u2019re mining deposits that we found in the late 1800s and in many cases we\u2019ve been mining those same deposits for the entire time,\u201d says Poulton.\n\nThe first step to finding new deposits is to look at where copper has already been discovered. \u201cWe have this saying in exploration that if you\u2019re hunting elephants, hunt in elephant country,\u201d says Poulton. Then, geologists will look at existing reports done by governments and universities and work with geophysics and geochemists to predict the probability of deposits.\n\nOnce a copper deposit has been located, the next step is getting it out of the ground, and new tech is starting to gain a foothold in this old industry. Two areas in Arizona are testing a method of mining copper without digging a hole, using a method called in situ leaching. Instead of excavating the materials and then processing, miners build wells and then pump a weak acid solution into the ground, and that solution dissolves the copper out of the minerals. Next, that solution is pumped out and processed to get the copper, and the miners flush clean water through the well field to get rid of as much acid as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re watching very closely to see how that will work\u201d because it could be better for the environment than traditional underground mining, says Poulton. (That said, the acid solution can still disturb the land.)\n\nRobots are also getting in on the action. Already, mines in remote areas like Western Australia and South America\u2019s Atacama Desert use mining robots. New copper resources will likely be found at even greater depths \u2014 like 7,000 feet below the surface \u2014 which means they\u2019ll be hotter and the rocks will be under extreme pressure. That means we\u2019ll require more engineering to build a stronger copper-mining robot capable of dealing with the extreme conditions.\n\nLITHIUM AND COBALT\n\nIf you build a massive renewable energy infrastructure, you\u2019re going to want some storage capacity to go with it. After all, people don\u2019t just want electricity when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. One ambitious solution is to use giant lithium-ion batteries, like a type being tested right now in South Australia.\n\nLithium is key for basically all rechargeable batteries, and there are two ways to get it right now, says Andrew Miller, a lithium analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. One method that\u2019s popular in South America is to evaporate it out of brine under a lake. For example, the world\u2019s largest source of lithium is Chile\u2019s Salar de Atacama lake. Lithium can also be extracted from spodumene, a hard-rock resource mostly found in Australia.\n\nMore spodumene mines are popping up as the battery market grows. Miller predicts that though South America and Australia will remain key, mines will start opening in places like Canada, North Carolina, and Nevada in the US; the United Kingdom; and the Czech Republic. \u201cYou\u2019ll see that pressure from consumers who don\u2019t want to be too heavily dependent on one or two parts of the world, particularly when they\u2019re making multi-billion investments in US or Europe or places without much lithium production,\u201d he says.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to cobalt \u2014 another key component of rechargeable batteries \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s going to be very hard for anywhere but the Democratic Republic of the Congo to dominate,\u201d says Caspar Rawles, a cobalt analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Cobalt is one of the most expensive materials in a battery, and it\u2019s also mined under conditions that often violate human rights. Last year, 70 percent of the world\u2019s cobalt came from the DRC, a country that has been a target of widespread criticism for its labor practices, such as using children as young as six to work in cobalt mines. Scientists and startups are rushing to create a cobalt-free battery, and Elon Musk even tweeted that he wanted to get cobalt out of his batteries, but that looks unlikely for now.", "description": "More politicians are starting to underscore the importance of transitioning to clean energy, which means more solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and large-scale batteries.
