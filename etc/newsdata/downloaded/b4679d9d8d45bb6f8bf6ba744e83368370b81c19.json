(Molly Shuler Pate)\n\nFor most of us, the idea of completing a 2.4-mile ocean swim, followed by a 112-mile bike ride through blazing-hot lava fields, then finally running a full marathon, sounds grueling.\n\nBut for 73-year-old Bobbe Greenberg, participating in the Ironman World Championship triathlon in Hawaii is a celebration.\n\n\u201cI am very, very, very lucky in my life,\u201d said Greenberg, who lives in Highland Park, Ill., with her husband of 50 years.\n\nWhile she\u2019s arguably one of the fittest septuagenarians in the world, Greenberg\u2019s greatest strength may actually be her mind.\n\nOn Saturday, the retired English teacher will return to the Ironman World Championship for the seventh time. This year, she\u2019ll defend her title as the women\u2019s age 70-74 champion.\n\n\n\nGreenberg at the Ironman Steelhead 70.3 race in 2017. (Molly Shuler Pate)\n\nLike most women of her generation, Greenberg didn\u2019t grow up playing sports. She discovered her competitive streak during a mandatory fitness challenge, in which she set a record for knee raises in the fifth grade. She was the kid on the playground who always wanted to race or play tag.\n\nDespite her athletic inclination, in high school she remained with the rest of the girls on the sidelines. As a cheerleader, she never imagined she\u2019d someday become an athlete in her own right, let alone one of the best long-course triathletes in the world.\n\n[How these 4 kids searched for \u2014 and found \u2014 a missing woman with dementia]\n\nAs a 22-year-old newlywed in 1968, Greenberg started playing in tennis tournaments, and her strong match performances showed her that she could persevere despite her lack of technique.\n\n\u201cI had no strong game. I had no backhand, no serve,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead, she outlasted opponents: \u201cI just won by keeping the ball in play.\u201d\n\nCompeting in triathlons wasn\u2019t on Greenberg\u2019s radar more than three decades later when she joined a gym in 2001. Her motivation at the time, she said, was she noticed she had \u201cterrible posture.\u201d\n\nHer spin instructor announced an upcoming indoor triathlon and encouraged the class to participate. It consisted of a 10-minute pool swim, a 20-minute stationary bike ride and a 15-minute treadmill run. She was 57 at the time and thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nThere was only one problem.\n\nGreenberg didn\u2019t know how to swim.\n\nInitially she thought she\u2019d skip swimming and run back and forth across the pool since the water was only waist-deep.\n\n\u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018That\u2019s stupid,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cWhy would I embarrass myself like that? I should learn how to swim.\u201d\n\nShe took a weekend course to learn the basics. She considered it expensive but saw it as an investment in her future. \u201cThis is something I can do when I'm 90,\u201d she recalled thinking.\n\nDespite her rudimentary swim skills, Greenberg finished her debut triathlon that year in first place. She was 20 years older than the second-place woman.\n\n[At age 101, this woman released her first collection of poems]\n\nShe\u2019s been hooked ever since. She trains at least 15 hours a week and participates in shorter races nearly every weekend in the spring and summer, when she\u2019s not spending time with her four grandchildren. She estimates she\u2019s completed 16 or 17 triathlons this year.\n\nShe loves the way racing makes her feel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a drug,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sweating, and I\u2019m pushing myself to my limits, and there\u2019s something very exhilarating. I think it\u2019s that feeling of youthfulness or vibrancy. \u2026 There\u2019s something it gives to me that I\u2019m not able to get in any other way in my life.\u201d\n\nTriathlon training also lets her be outdoors, which studies show promotes mental and physical well-being. She described \u201ca feeling of spirituality, being outside, looking at nature.\u201d Other competitors will complain about strong winds after a race. But Greenberg doesn\u2019t even notice them. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Really?\u2019 [I\u2019m in] a positive state the whole time,\u201d she said.\n\nFocusing on the positive comes naturally to Greenberg. It\u2019s something she picked up from her brother, who died a few years ago after living his life with a disability that left him with a limp. Because of various health issues, doctors predicted he wouldn\u2019t live beyond his first birthday, but he proved them wrong. Despite not being able to participate in athletics, he was the manager of all the sports teams in high school and popular among his peers. His disability never seemed to get him down. \u201cIt would be the iciest day, and you\u2019d see him sprinting on crutches,\u201d she said.\n\nHe endured 18 surgeries on his leg. His leg was amputated the day after Greenberg, then 60, ran the Boston Marathon.\u201c\n\n[Is the world exciting or terrifying? Your answer can shape your life and your political views.]\n\nOne of her great pleasures for the past three years has been competing in the Miami half-marathon while pushing a woman with disabilities in a wheelchair.\n\nHer role models include a handful of women who have represented the women\u2019s 75-79 age group in Ironman events. She recalled a recent conversation with one such athlete, Cherie Gruenfeld, a former Ironman champion who now sticks to 70.3\u2019s (half the full Ironman distance).\n\nGreenberg asked Gruenfeld why she quit Ironman when she was on top. Gruenfeld\u2019s answer was simple: She wasn\u2019t enjoying it anymore. \u201cSo I think to myself, \u2018Are you still enjoying this? Is this still fun?' \u201d Greenberg said. \u201cAnd it is.\u201d\n\nWhile she happily gallops through races, astounded at how much faster she is in a race than during a training session, often dropping at least a minute per mile off her run pace, Greenberg keeps training fun by doing it with friends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a day where I don\u2019t have someone to meet,\u201d she said.\n\n[At 78, this ballerina is still going strong: \u2018It\u2019s never too late to do something you love\u2019]\n\nWhile many triathletes hire personal coaches to design individualized training plans for them, Greenberg has always masterminded her own regimen, which gives her the flexibility to train with a friend or a group. Not only does the self-proclaimed chatterbox enjoy the time she spends connecting with her training buddies during a workout, she also appreciates the accountability.\n\nWhile most of her younger competitors in Kona will cross the finish line around the 10-hour mark, she\u2019ll take about 14 to 15 hours to finish.\n\nShe\u2019ll be at the back of the pack overall \u2014 there will be about 2,500 participants in the race. But she plans to be ahead of the 75 or so people age 70 and older who, like her, qualified to be there.\n\nShe says she doesn\u2019t mind having the course to herself.\n\n\u201cI just love the sport.\u201d\n\nPam Moore is a writer and speaker in Boulder, Colo.\n\nRead more:\n\nEmployees at this Florida bar pulled about $14,000 off the walls \u2014 and they\u2019re donating it to Hurricane Dorian relief\n\nMonths later, woman meets the stranger whose life she saved\n\nWhy this man put up billboards proclaiming, \u2018Amy, I love you more!\u2019\n\nThis man proposed to his girlfriend by planting a carrot inside a diamond ring, and waiting months for her to discover it", "description": "The retired English teacher will return to the Ironman World Championship for the seventh time.
