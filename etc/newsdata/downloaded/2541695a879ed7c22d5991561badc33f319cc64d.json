He flew to Michigan, took a helicopter to the small island airport and transferred to vehicles brought by boat the night before.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press says it was the first ever motorcade on the island, which has prohibited vehicles since 1898 except for snowmobiles, emergency and service vehicles.\n\nJulia Pulver, a Democratic state Senate candidate in 2018, criticized the motorcade on Twitter, calling it a \"huge transgression.\"\n\nWhen President Gerald Ford visited the island in 1975, he travelled by horse-drawn carriage. But supporters of Pence noted security is much tighter now.", "description": "The island has prohibited vehicles since 1898 except for snowmobiles, emergency and service vehicles", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/20/50708c48-3366-4ed9-a7bd-5b36358d3817/thumbnail/1200x630/a493f9dabe1855a105a5ae02d9e0cb10/screen-shot-2019-01-20-at-11-08-54-am.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
