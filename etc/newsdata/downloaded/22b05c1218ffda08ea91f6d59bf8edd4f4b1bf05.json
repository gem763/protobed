He was wrong\n\nAt the same time as calling for an investigation of the former vice-president and frontrunner in the Democratic primary, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, Trump noted that the US was in trade talks with China and \u201cif they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power\u201d.\n\nAsked if he had already asked China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, to start an investigation, the president said: \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about.\u201d\n\nLater on Thursday, CNN reported Trump had brought up Biden in a June phone call with Xi, mentioning the former vice-president\u2019s political prospects, as well as those of Senator Elizabeth Warren. Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on the unfolding Hong Kong protests as long as trade talks between the US and China progressed, CNN said. The White House record of the June call was reportedly stored in the top restricted database that also contained the call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nTrump spoke on Thursday as his former special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, was giving evidence to House committees about what he knew about parallel contacts with Kyiv conducted by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and aimed exclusively at obtaining compromising material on the Bidens.\n\nAccording to ABC News, among the materials Volker provided to Congress was a text message from the acting US ambassador to Kyiv, Bill Taylor, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nAnother ambassador, Gordon Sondland, a Trump mega-donor and the current envoy to the European Union, disagreed, saying the president had made it \u201ccrystal clear no quid pro quo of any kind\u201d, and then texted to suggest they take the discussion off-line.\n\nHunter Biden was on the board of an energy company in the eastern European country, where Joe Biden, as vice-president, pressed for the dismissal of the chief prosecutor. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by father or son.\n\nWhat happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine Donald Trump\n\nTrump has insisted he did nothing wrong in his dealings with the Ukrainian president, and has even accused an intelligence whistleblower of treason for providing evidence that the president used the power of his office \u2013 the withholding of military aid and a summit meeting \u2013 for his own political ends.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to do just that in front of the cameras on the White House lawn on Thursday, when he openly called for Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIf they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nOn a 2013 trip to China, the then vice-president took his son with him on his official plane. The younger Biden was in the process of setting up a private equity fund, BHR, with money coming in part from Chinese investors.\n\nHunter Biden later acknowledged having met a prospective partner during the trip, though a spokesperson told NBC News it was a social encounter.\n\nThere is no evidence the Bidens did anything illegal.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump also noted that Chinese negotiators are due in Washington for the latest round of high-stakes trade talks, and threatened negative consequences if Chinese leaders did not make concessions.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese are coming in next week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a meeting with them, we\u2019ll see, but we\u2019re doing very well. I have a lot of options on China. But if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power.\u201d\n\nBeijing has shown itself to be sensitive to Trump family dynamics.\n\nIn 2018, Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion and homewares business received initial Chinese approval for trademark applications days before her father announced a reversal in policy, dropping a US ban against ZTE, a Chinese telecoms firm that admitted breaking US sanctions on Iran and North Korea.", "description": "* \u2018If they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power\u2019    * Impeachment inquiry concerns similar behavior with Ukraine  * Trump calls on China to investigate Biden \u2013 liveDonald Trump has called for China to investigate his leading political rival, in defiance of impeachment proceedings in Congress", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Lauren Gambino In Washington"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wnm_cUVGpVFss.GIEB4ufA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/1c391024604ff3afdb2fda13d6ac334c", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
