Photo: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic\n\nThe comedy podcast universe is ever expanding, not unlike the universe universe. We\u2019re here to make it a bit smaller, a bit more manageable. There are a lot of great shows, and each one has a lot of great episodes, so we want to highlight the exceptional, the noteworthy. Each week, our crack team of podcast enthusiasts and specialists and especially enthusiastic people will pick their favorites. We hope to have your ears permanently plugged with the best in aural comedy.\n\nThe Great American Cabinet of Curiosities \u2014 Poke in the Mush With Emily Heller\n\nLeave it to Andy Daly to create a show that revolves around a German aristocrat who mimics 16th-century explorers by collecting odds and ends from around the world. Much like the circus rolling into town without warning, Daly\u2019s latest podcast venture is a high-flying spectacle of weirdness too good to pass up. The Great American Cabinet of Curiosities is basically what happens when members of an early-1900s adventurer\u2019s league partake in a grammar school\u2019s show-and-tell. This week, in front of a live audience, William George Frederick Schmitt-Hoffman the 28th (Daly) and his valet (Sean Conroy) welcome Emily Heller. As specialized collectors, Daly, Conroy, and Heller present their relics of note from Daly\u2019s cabinet of curiosities to the audience. For an idea that should really only work visually, the true fun of this show lies in hearing our panel describe these antiquities in great detail. For example, Daly\u2019s eagerness to show off a \u201cself-portrait\u201d of the Dutch countryside is about as good as it gets. Without giving away too much, do yourself a favor and open up the cabinet of curiosities. Within, you\u2019ll be sure to find some laughs thanks to the comedic driving force that is Andy Daly. \u2014Tom Rainey\n\nListen: Website\n\nMaybe Don\u2019t \u2014 The Episode With No Jokes\n\nIn just eight episodes, Maybe Don\u2019t has already established itself as the comedy podcast with the lowest self-esteem. Chef Kevin (Bartelt) of Hollywood Handbook and Yusong \u201cDid Nothing Wrong\u201d Liu of Doughboys have spun off their podcast producer credits into an Earwolf project of their own. Self-described as \u201ca variety show with an opening segment and a closing segment,\u201d Maybe Don\u2019t squarely hits the Venn diagram of Doughboys\u2019 self-deprecation and the self-reverential comedy of Hollywood Handbook. Bartelt and Liu continue to lower audience expectations to subzero levels in this week\u2019s appropriately titled \u201cThe Episode With No Jokes,\u201d earning more honest laughs from vulnerable overshares and (gasp!) Yusong\u2019s opinions. Genuine advice for time management, quitting things, and social media cleansing is pleasantly set to Liu\u2019s impromptu piano score. \u201cI truly take it as a sign of great flattery when someone says, \u2018I put you on in the background as I do other stuff.\u2019 That\u2019s all I ever wanted,\u201d Liu repeats in the introduction. Maybe Don\u2019t is proudly turning into a comfy, low-commitment listen that has always existed in podcasting, but was never intentionally created \u2014 until now. \u2014Mark Kramer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nWTF \u2014 Edi Patterson\n\nThe Danny McBride\u2013Jody Hill\u2013David Gordon Green triumvirate have produced three excellent shows (Eastbound & Down, Vice Principals, The Righteous Gemstones) thanks in part to a holster stuffed with secret-weapon character actors. After a scene-stealing role in Vice Principals as Neal Gamby\u2019s obsessive admirer-colleague, Texan actress and writer Edi Patterson should rightfully become a name that everybody knows thanks to her role in that trio\u2019s latest southern-fried epic of idiots bursting with unearned confidence. As she tells Marc Maron, Patterson was a dorky teen who first learned how to act by watching her hip older lesbian cousin. Turns out the secret to being cool is simply to pretend to be cool. Nobody will be none the wiser! After a decade of bit parts and live performances as a Groundlings performer, Patterson started to get her due as a guest writer on SNL and a starring role on the sitcom Partners. That latter show, a forgotten 10/90 sitcom starring Kelsey Grammer and Martin Lawrence, severely altered her career trajectory when it prevented her from accepting a full-time staff position at SNL. But that near disaster for her career turned out to be a godsend when Partners was canceled, leaving her free to do Vice Principals. Thanks to The Righteous Gemstones, which she also writes on, renewed for season two, and a recently completed film script she wrote with McBride, Patterson may soon be known by more than just fans of cult comedies. \u2014Pablo Goldstein\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nFilling the Void \u2014 Magic & More With David Wain\n\nThis \u201cfeel-good\u201d podcast is the brainchild of Lesley Arfin (who created the series Love on Netflix), who wanted to discover what kinds of cool, interesting, and bizarre hobbies are enjoyed by super-busy people when they\u2019re not busy being \u2026 busy. Ms. Arfin is so busy at the moment that she\u2019s taking a hiatus from Filling the Void and so, filling that void, is the quick, funny, and slightly salty Kerri Kenney (The State, Reno 911), guest hosting for a few installments. This week her guest is writer, director, comedian, and Kenney\u2019s former platonic roommate David Wain, who not only seems incredibly busy, but has also developed a contingent of hobbies to fill all the various seconds in between working work. And then he gets around to perfecting them. Among a few: He taught himself magic, but not just a few card tricks \u2014 he developed an act good enough to become a member of famed Magic Castle in Hollywood. He never figured out how to do a Rubik\u2019s Cube as a kid, but as an adult? He can now solve the puzzle in 30 seconds flat. He plays squash. He cooks. And he blows off steam by playing the drums; he even pushed the actual drummer off the stage in the band he\u2019d hired to play for his own 50th birthday party. Kenny and Wain are clearly friends (going on over 30 years now), and to hear them cracking each other up and cackling together at half-referenced hijinks from their early days (like living off nothing but boxes of Golden Grahams cereal for days at a time) is to feel like we\u2019ve been invited along for a fun ride that ends all too soon. \u2014Marc Hershon\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nGet Rich Nick \u2014 Task Rabbit\n\nPart critique, part field guide of the gig economy, Get Rich Nick sees Nick Turner and Nick Vatterott \u201cclumsily try every get-rich-quick scheme under the sun in an attempt to \u2026 get rich beyond their mildest dreams.\u201d The duo takes you through the ins and outs of each endeavor, from old standbys like donating plasma to this week\u2019s foray into Task Rabbit, an app that allows users to ask \u201cTaskers\u201d to complete menial tasks in exchange for money. Easy laughs come early when Turner shares the skill descriptions he uses to hook clients. \u201cI\u2019ve planned all of my own weddings\u201d is what he wrote in the event-planning category of the app, for example. Hidden in the humor, however, is a helpful tip for prospective Taskers: People want someone they can have fun with, so don\u2019t be a dud. Later, we join Turner and Vatterott as they move a mattress that has literal layers of stains from top sheet to fitted sheet to mattress protector to mattress. \u201cIt was like an archaeological dig of this guy\u2019s life in this apartment,\u201d says Vatterott. The silver lining to an otherwise soiled adventure is that Task Rabbit is one of the gigs that pay (\u201cYou can easily make a $1,000 a week\u201d), and the duo is generous with their advice on getting tipped and staying busy on the app. Tune in and cash out. \u2014Becca James\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nOther Podcasts We\u2019re Listening To:\n\nDr. Gameshow \u2014 Forever 11 With Eliza Hurwitz\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nHound Tall \u2014 Orgasms, Genital Stroking, and Sex Addiction With Brian Huskey, Joe Derosa, and Sabrina Jalees\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nWhat\u2019s Eating You? \u2014 Fun Times With Fareeha Khan\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nUnder the Scales \u2014 Scott Aukerman\n\nListen: Apple | Website\n\nAssisting \u2014 Mr. Forrester Would Like His Horse to Be in a Movie\n\nListen: Apple\n\nSecret Keepers Club \u2014 Missin\u2019 You Like Candy\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nGot a comedy podcast recommendation?
