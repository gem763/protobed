They will sign a voluntary declaration drafted by New York City.\n\nThe set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, unanimously approved by the 193 U.N. member nations in 2015, is a wide-ranging \u201cto-do\u201d list tackling such issues as conflict, hunger, land degradation, gender equality and climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a time when national governments are abdicating their responsibility on urgent issues. That is why cities are stepping up,\u201d said New York City\u2019s International Affairs Commissioner Penny Abeywardena.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has described global warming as a hoax, dealt a blow to U.N.-led efforts to fight climate change when he pulled the United States from the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord.\n\nBrazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro has also expressed doubts as to whether climate change is man-made and is ambivalent about the Paris accord, though he walked back a campaign pledge to quit the pact.\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s position on climate change, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters on Friday that there was \u201can extraordinary commitment to climate action\u201d in American society.\n\n\u201cGovernments have much less influence than what people can imagine,\u201d he said during a visit to the hurricane-devastated Bahamas. \u201cThe influence is today, more and more in relation to climate change, related to what cities, businesses and communities do.\u201d\n\nUnder the Sustainable Development Goals, countries are encouraged to report annually to the United Nations on their progress. In 2018, New York became the first city to do so, submitting what it called a Voluntary Local Review (VLR).\n\n\u201cIn a time when citizens feel overwhelmed by foreign policy, the VLR allows us all to remember that action starts at home,\u201d Abeywardena said.\n\nCITIES \u2018INSTRUMENTAL\u2019\n\nThis year New York, Bristol, Buenos Aires, Helsinki, Los Angeles, Taipei, Brazilian city Santana de Parnaiba and Mexico\u2019s Oaxaca state all reported on sustainable development progress.\n\n\u201cAlthough a nation-state level commitment, the United Nations\u2019 Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals are universal. They are the closest thing we have to a global contract,\u201d said Jan Vapaavuori, mayor of Finland\u2019s capital Helsinki.\n\n\u201cWe aim to highlight the importance of collaboration between cities and nation-states in achieving the global goals. However, where countries are unable to deliver, it is even more instrumental that cities step up,\u201d he said.\n\nNew York City, Helsinki, Buenos Aires and 13 other cities will be the first to sign a declaration next week, in which cities pledge \u201cto use the framework of the SDGs to do our part to help end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and work to prevent the harmful effects of climate change by 2030.\u201d\n\nA U.N. report in July warned that relentless global warming was threatening the potential success of implementing all the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nBuenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta said city coordination could accelerate sustainable development.\n\nHe added that even though the U.N. agenda was focused national governments it \u201cwill also depend on the ability of cities to make them a reality, especially since they are key drivers of growth and economic and social development.\u201d\n\nThe other cities planning to sign the declaration are: Accra, Ghana; Barcelona, Spain; Bristol, Britain; Cape Town, South Africa; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Kazan, Russia; Los Angeles, United States; Malmo, Sweden; Mannheim, Germany; Montevideo, Uruguay; Barcarena, Brazil; Santa Ana, Costa Rica; and Santa Fe, Argentina.", "description": "As some world leaders question whether the world is facing a climate emergency, more than a dozen cities are stepping up to tackle global warming and sustainable development and will next week pledge to report their progress to the United Nations.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430531499&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1AI", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
