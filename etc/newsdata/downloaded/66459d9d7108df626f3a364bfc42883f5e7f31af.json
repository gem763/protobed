The only previous interstellar visitor discovered in our solar system was a cigar-shaped rocky object called \u2018Oumuamua found in 2017.\n\nThe comet was studied using telescopes in Hawaii and Spain.\n\n\u201cIts properties determined so far - morphology, color, estimated size - are remarkably similar to the native solar system comets. This is important because it shows that comets exist in interstellar space, confirming long-standing predictions, and it tells us that comets similar to the ones we know from this solar system also form around other stars,\u201d said astronomer Michal Drahus of Jagiellonian University in Poland.\n\nBoth 2I/Borisov and \u2018Oumuamua formed in other planetary systems and were ejected by gravitational perturbations into interstellar space as orphans wandering the cosmos.\n\n\u201cOur Solar System is regularly visited by escapees from other planetary systems, and it has always been this way. It\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t been able to detect them until recently,\u201d Drahus said.\n\nThe speed of 2I/Borisov and the nature of its orbital path demonstrated that it did not originate in our solar system, Jagiellonian University astronomer Piotr Guzik said. Guzik added that he expects that within a decade or so a space probe will be sent from Earth to visit an interstellar object.\n\n\u201cI think this is the most important and transformative moment for planetary astronomy since the discovery of the first exoplanets (planets in other star systems) in the early 1990s and a milestone for astronomy in general. Interstellar minor bodies are this long-sought bridge between other planetary systems and our own solar system. I like to think of them as miniature exoplanets in our own cosmic backyard,\u201d Drahus said.\n\nThe comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on Dec. 8 and its closest point to the Earth soon thereafter, coming within about 186 million miles (300 million km) of our planet. By way of comparison, the moon orbits about 240,000 miles (386,000 km) from Earth.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Astronomy.", "description": "The second interstellar object ever spotted passing through the solar system is a comet that appears quite like those formed in our neighborhood of the cosmos, providing fresh evidence that other planetary systems may be very similar to our own.", "authors": ["Will Dunham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440835004&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1OE", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
