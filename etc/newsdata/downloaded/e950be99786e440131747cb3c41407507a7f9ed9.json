In the third and final step, the referee decides to abandon the match.\n\n\u201cThere is the UEFA process and we have to have faith in that process. Then everything else is hypothetical,\u201d Southgate told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe want the players to be able to concentrate on football, they want to be judged on football. What I\u2019ve got to do is provide a secure, safe environment for them to play.\u201d\n\nEngland play the Czech Republic on Friday and Bulgaria on Monday. UEFA ordered the partial closure of Bulgaria\u2019s Vasil Levski stadium after racist behaviour by their supporters in June\u2019s qualifiers against the Czechs and Kosovo.\n\nEngland striker Tammy Abraham indicated this week that the players could act as a group and leave the pitch if subjected to abuse, regardless of UEFA\u2019s protocol.\n\nIn response, Bulgarian soccer chief Borislav Mihaylov said England players who walk off the pitch should face punishment if they breach UEFA protocol and Southgate tried to defuse the situation.\n\n\u201cWe are not trying to create a situation at all, far from it,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe\u2019re all hoping that over the next 72 hours, we\u2019re just talking about two football matches.\n\n\u201cI think both countries would have a strong desire for that and I have to say again, we don\u2019t look at other countries in a way that we don\u2019t shine a mirror on our own.\u201d\n\nSouthgate was referring to a National League game last month between Hartlepool and Dover which was suspended for more than 10 minutes after alleged racist abuse from the supporters.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Hartlepool a couple of weeks ago was probably worse than things I\u2019ve seen or heard about in many other countries in the world,\u201d Southgate added. \u201cSo, I think we have to be very careful in how we cover everything.\u201d\n\nEngland, who have a game in hand, are top of Group A with 12 points from four games. The Czech Republic are second with nine points and Bulgaria bottom with two.", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate has said his team will adhere to UEFA's protocols if they are subjected to racist abuse in their Euro 2020 qualifiers but stated that his priority would be to provide a safe environment for his players.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439422963&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9927R", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
