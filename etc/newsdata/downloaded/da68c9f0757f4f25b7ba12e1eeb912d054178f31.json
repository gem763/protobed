This time, there was unity and composure. This time, they held the line and rallied. They didn\u2019t unravel.\n\nEngland's quarter-final victory against Australia proved they had banished their demons\n\nIt was a success founded on mental resilience, defensive commitment and all manner of earthy qualities.\n\nEngland ended up putting 40 points on the Wallabies, but their victory came down to so many nuts-and-bolts factors. It came down to Tom Curry\u2019s relentless dynamism and ferocity. It came down to Sam Underhill\u2019s 20 sledgehammer tackles and Kyle Sinckler overcoming adversity and wind-up tactics to score his first Test try and produce the steal of his life.\n\nThe ghosts of the collapse against Scotland were chased out of town. Back in March, a Calcutta Cup procession turned into a calamity as England went from 31-0 up to a 38-31 deficit at Twickenham, before a George Ford try rescued a draw.\n\nJones admitted that the Six Nations finale exposed glaring flaws which had to be addressed. He brought in sports psychologists. Their input has evidently had the desired effect.\n\nSo this time, when Australia surged to within a point after half-time, England\u2019s nerve held and they regained the initiative, on the way to a seventh successive defeat of the Wallabies and a first World Cup semi-final since 2007.\n\nEddie Jones had enlisted the help of sports psychologists after England's Six Nations collapse\n\nAsked about the ability to stay level-headed in the face of a fightback, hooker Jamie George said: \u2018It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been working on for a long time.\n\n\u2018It pains me to say it, but you rewind to that Scotland game at Twickenham. When games get close, we\u2019ve been criticised in the past; after that Wales game away, too (a 21-13 Six Nations defeat).\n\n\u2018The most impressive thing for me is how we\u2019ve revolutionised that. We have been able to talk about it. We\u2019ve been in different scenarios and we\u2019ve been challenged a lot in the warm-up games. I feel like, in terms of the mind-set and mentality side of things when games get tough, we look like a completely different team from the one that drew to Scotland and lost to Wales in the Six Nations.\u2019\n\nScrum-half Ben Youngs echoed those sentiments, adding: \u2018What I am most pleased about is the fact that the game got tight, they put us under pressure and everything that we rehearsed and practised and sat in meetings about how we handle it and how we get a grip on it, we were able to do.\u2019\n\nTom Curry's all-action performance made him a worthy man of the match against the Wallabies\n\nEngland\u2019s defensive effort was led by the rookie flankers. The vaunted Australian pairing known as \u2018Pooper\u2019 \u2014 David Pocock and captain Michael Hooper \u2014 were utterly eclipsed by the English tyros. Curry is just 21 and was magnificent. His all-action performance made him a worthy man of the match. Underhill was a prime contender for that award too and the back-row alliance continues to galvanise England.\n\nOff the field, team-mates mock the two quirky characters. But when it comes to game-time, they are in awe of their work. Youngs said: \u2018I had lunch with Curry today. I said, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d. He said, \u201cI am excited. I am playing against someone I idolised\u201d. I said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, you can show him how the new breed are\u201d.\n\n\u2018I thought he was phenomenal. So was Sam. What a fantastic day for those two to test themselves against David and Hooper, who are tremendous players, and come out on top.\u2019\n\nEngland skipper Owen Farrell rediscovered his authority as a playmaker after Jones' advice\n\nIt was an impressive occasion for the captain. Farrell was off-colour in England\u2019s last game. After switching him back to fly-half, Jones revealed that he urged his skipper to focus more on his own game. The advice was heeded. Farrell rediscovered his authority as a playmaker and was on target with all eight shots at goal.\n\n\u2018I am not surprised, because that is just how he is and who he is,\u2019 said Youngs. \u2018I even thought the other week when he missed a load, \u201cThat\u2019s alright because he\u2019ll bang them all over next week\u201d. He conducted the team unbelievably well and as for the kicking, he loves that pressure really.\u2019\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone. It was a great job all round. England faced their first serious problem of this campaign and they solved it. They didn\u2019t panic. They proved that the demons have been banished.\n\nTheir reward is a step closer to immortality.", "description": "CHRIS FOY: As the dust was still settling on their finest World Cup victory for a generation, England's players savoured a triumph which proved they had banished their demons.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/22/19966734-0-image-a-113_1571606755212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
