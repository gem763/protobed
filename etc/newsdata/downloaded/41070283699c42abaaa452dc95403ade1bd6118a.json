To get you in gear for the holiday, we\u2019ve put all our Halloween coverage in one place, from the decorations you need to transform your abode into that perfectly spooky haunted house to the baby costumes that your 6-month-old won\u2019t squirm in. Stay tuned as we continue to update this page throughout the month.\n\nKieran Culkin from Succession If you\u2019re looking for an easy and topical costume for Halloween this year, Strategist writer Liza Corsillo suggests that all you actually need to dress like one of the Roy kids is a sharp topcoat and well-stuffed envelope. But if you haven\u2019t been keeping up with Succession, Liza also offers some suggestions for other pop-culture costumes (that you can buy on Amazon). $75 at Amazon Buy $75 at Amazon Buy\n\nNamsan Cat Sailor Outfit Although this costume gets mixed reviews from cats themselves \u2014 some \u201cstrut around\u201d in it, whereas others, specifically smaller cats, despise the fit \u2014 over 200 owners agree that it is \u201ccute as heck.\u201d One hyperenthusiastic reviewer, who describes this costume as life-changing, even claims that the nautical getup has duped people into believing that their cat is a sailor: \u201cThe sailor outfit is so realistic that he\u2019s got offered jobs to run large shipping lines.\u201d For a less-nautical cat costume, we found other well-reviewed superhero and pirate-themed costumes for cats. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nLeg Avenue Women's Wet-Look Zipper-Front Catsuit Among the many well-reviewed costumes for women on Amazon, this vinyl catsuit was the go-to pick for thousands of women, the basis for their Catwoman or jewelry-thief costumes. Although it is \u201cskintight,\u201d reviewers of a variety of body types deem it to be comfortable for a wide range of motion, and flattering. \u201cThis is the best jumpsuit you can buy for a thick girl like myself with a small waist,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cI won best dressed in a costume contest and got lots of compliments.\u201d From $18 at Amazon Buy From $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nTOMSENN Dog Lion Mane For Halloween, hundreds of satisfied dog owners found dinosaur- and skeleton-themed costumes for their dogs, but this lion costume is the greatest crowd-pleaser. Several reviewers note that \u201cpeople just go nuts\u201d over this costume, including one customer who writes that \u201cpeople across the street came over to check my dog out. Golden-retriever owners praise this costume\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d coloring, but owners of a few different breeds all agree that this mane and tail were \u201cworth every penny.\u201d $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nAeromax ASP-Romp Astronaut Suit with NASA Patch If a bright-pink space suit sized for a 6-month-old baby doesn\u2019t scream \u201cauthentic\u201d NASA space suit to you, then you haven\u2019t seen this Aeromax costume for babies. \u201cThis was probably the closest to an actual astronaut outfit that I could find, and the patches were stitched on, making it look more authentic,\u201d writes one of many five-star reviewers who praise this suit for its realistic detailing and versatile fabric. Other satisfied customers chose a different Halloween costume for their baby, including a (less expensive) Pooh-bear bodysuit, or a fuzzy-baby-monster outfit. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nMysterium $38 (was $50, now 24% off) We found the top 13 Halloween party games, including this ghoulish board game, which was recommended by almost every expert we spoke to. \u201cIt\u2019s full of some of the most beautiful, creepy, and sinister art you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said board-game-blog editor Dr. Michael James Heron. Plus, its creepy premise is perfect for Halloween: In groups from two to seven people, players must rid a haunted mansion of its undead residents and solve the mystery of the ghost\u2019s murder. $38 at Amazon Buy $38 at Amazon Buy\n\nHome Accents Holiday 5 ft. Poseable Skeleton With LED Illumination We spoke with five haunted-house experts in order to find the best Halloween decorations for transforming your home into a haunted house, and all of them recommended shopping at Home Depot. In addition to the cobwebs, creepy lighting, and fog machines, Kris Golojuch, the founder of a haunted-house-design consultation firm, suggests that the best deal is this professional-quality skeleton: \u201cIt\u2019s very lightweight and it accepts paint, it\u2019s easy to age, add things to it. You can dress them up, and it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot to stand them up if you use some rebar.\u201d $30 at Home Depot Buy\n\nGardeningwill Set of 2 Hanging Tattered Black Spiderweb Gauze Cloths If you want to find Halloween decorations at party-supply warehouse prices with a less kitschy feel, these cheap but expensive-looking options from Amazon will do the trick. Whether you\u2019re going all-out on a spooky haunted house or just want to stick with an orange-and-black motif, there are a bunch of online options below $20 \u2014 including this faux spider-web set, which is enough creepy webbing to drape over your doorway, porch, or windows. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nMehron Makeup Paradise AQ Face & Body Paint 8-Color Palette Mehron Makeup is expert-recommended and user-friendly special-effects makeup, which is why almost all of the professional makeup artists we spoke to named it as the best Halloween makeup for your face, in addition to special picks for kids and prosthetics. Professional makeup artist Morgan Wells specifically recommended this wide-ranging palette, noting that the paint will wash off with water so \u201cyou walk away from the night with your face intact, and not left with 50,000 colors when you \u2018remove\u2019 it.\u201d $34 at Amazon Buy $34 at Amazon Buy\n\nMehron Makeup Liquid Face and Body Paint On more than one occasion, professional makeup artist Rebecca Perkins has been tasked with making actors look like realistic corpses, and she always uses this Mehron Makeup body paint. \u201cIf these paints can hold up through a three-hour Shakespearean ghoul fest, they\u2019ll be fine for Halloween,\u201d she promises. Other makeup artists recommended a slew of paints and powders (plus tools) that they say are the best body-makeup picks for your head-to-toe Halloween costume. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nStar Wars Roaring Chewbacca Mask While some of the best Halloween masks shock or confuse trick-or-treaters, this roaring and growling Chewbacca mask elicits laughs from the whole family and is well reviewed by couples and grandparents alike. \u201cMy wife and I loved this so much that we bought another one for ourselves and another for a friend,\u201d writes one satisfied shopper who checked out lots of other Star Wars masks before settling on this one for its realistic Chewbacca voice. \u201cWe haven\u2019t laughed so hard about a toy ever. This mask is definitely worth every penny.\u201d $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
