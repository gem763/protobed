Gig economy workers are freelancers, such as journalists who don't work for one publication directly, freelance developers, drivers on platforms like Uber and Grab, and consumers who rent out their apartments via Airbnb or other home-sharing sites.\n\nGig economy workers are not employed by these platforms, and therefore typically don't receive conventional employee perks, such as insurance or retirement options. This has created a lucrative opportunity to provide tailored insurance policies for the gig economy.\n\nA number of insurtech startups \u2014 including UK-based Dinghy, which focuses on liability insurance, and US-based Slice, which provides on-demand insurance for a range of areas \u2014 have moved to capitalize on this new segment of the labor market. These companies have been busy finding new ways to personalize insurance products by incorporating emerging technologies, including AI and chatbots, to target the gig economy.\n\nIn Insurtech and The Gig Economy, Business Insider Intelligence examines how insurtechs have begun addressing the gig economy, the kinds of policies they are offering, and how incumbents can tap the market themselves. We have opted to focus on three areas of insurance particularly relevant to the gig economy: vehicle insurance, home insurance, and equipment and liability insurance.\n\nWhile every consumer needs health insurance, there are already a number of insurtechs and incumbent insurers that offer policies for individuals. However, when it comes to insuring work equipment or other utilities for freelancers, it's much more difficult to find suitable coverage. As such, this is the gap in the market where we see the most opportunity to deploy new products.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report include: Airbnb, Deliveroo, Dinghy, Grab, Progressive, Slice, Uber, Urban Jungle, and Zego.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nBy 2027, the majority of the US workforce will work as freelancers, per Upwork and Freelancer Union , though not all of these workers will take part in the gig economy full time.\n\nBy personalizing policies for gig economy workers, insurtechs have been able to tap this opportunity early.\n\nA number of other insurtechs, including Slice and UK-based Zego, offer temporary vehicle insurance, which users can switch on and off, depending on when they are working.\n\nSlice has also developed a new insurance model that combines traditional home insurance with business coverage for temporary use.\n\nOther freelancers like photojournalists need insurance for their camera, for example, a coverage area that Dinghy has tackled.\n\nIncumbent insurers have a huge opportunity to leverage their reach and well-known brands to pull in the gig economy and secure a share of this growing segment \u2014 and partnering with startups might be the best approach.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\n\n\nDetails what the gig economy landscape looks like in different markets.\n\nExplains how different insurtechs are tackling the gig economy with new personalized policies.\n\nHighlights possible pain points for incumbents when trying to enter this market.\n\nDiscusses how incumbents can get a piece of the pie by partnering with startups.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
