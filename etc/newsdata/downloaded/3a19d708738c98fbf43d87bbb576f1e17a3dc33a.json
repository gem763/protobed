The process has been gradual since 2012, but has already shown significant improvement in the amount of money citizens have saved for their futures \u2014 compared with when workers were left to sign up for an account on their own.\n\nAbout nine in 10 workers at medium and large companies are now contributing to a retirement plan, and 70% at small employers, according to an analysis by the Boston College Center for Retirement Research. Comparatively, 51% of Americans in the private workforce were participating in a workplace retirement plan, according to the Pension Rights Center.\n\nThe auto-enrollment mandate, referred to as the NEST program (short for the National Employment Savings Trust), is layered on top of the country\u2019s public old age pension, similar to the U.S.\u2019s Social Security. The government-backed pension is basic, said Ramsey Alwin, director of thought leadership in financial resilience, policy, research and international affairs at AARP, but the British also don\u2019t have to worry as much as Americans about expensive medical costs in old age, since the country has state-funded health care.\n\nRetirees receive $169 a week under the State Pension, but the amount can be higher if they delay their benefit payments (similar to the U.S. system). Eligibility age varies for men and women depending on their date of birth (for example, a man is eligible this year if he is 68 years old, and a woman if she\u2019s 66, both born after April 6). They must also have worked for at least 10 qualifying years.\n\nThe NEST program doubles down on retirement security though, as a means to ensuring residents are comfortable in retirement.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: U.K. employees are eligible for the government-sponsored workplace retirement plan, which invests those assets, if they\u2019re at least 22 years old but no older than 65 or 63 (the state pension ages for men and women, respectively), earn at least $13,000 (converted from euros) and were with their company for at least three months. Beginning in April 2019, employees must contribute at least 5% of earnings and employers must contribute at least 3%, for a total minimum contribution of at least 8%, according to the Pensions Regulator in the U.K. Those minimum requirements have slowly increased each year. Companies were phased into this mandate, beginning with the largest employers.\n\nThe system is working, so far. Employees at medium and large companies saw participation rates jump 37% after auto-enrollment was implemented, and smaller employers saw a 44% increase. Lower earners, employees under 40 and people who had been with their companies less than four years benefited the most from auto-enrollment, Boston College found.\n\nEncouraging employees to put money away for retirement is always a good thing, and yet there\u2019s a caveat. Employers are enrolling workers with a low contribution rate, which may ease them into getting started, but doesn\u2019t add up to enough if they continue to save the minimum rate throughout their careers. Bottom line: If workers don\u2019t consistently ramp up contributions, they won\u2019t end up saving very much for retirement.\n\nSometimes employees consider the contribution rate they were enrolled with to be a suggestion from their employer, or they may never get around to changing it on their own, even years after they were automatically enrolled. If they do increase the rate, they may still not put as much away as they should (in the U.S., for example, companies that auto-enroll workers in a 401(k) plan start with 3% to 6% of an employee\u2019s salary, but financial advisers typically suggest Americans save as much as 15% or more for retirement).\n\nStill, the U.K.\u2019s system shows promise, especially as so many citizens across the globe lack retirement savings. \u201cThat pooled federal platform is critical,\u201d Alwin said, especially as workers move from job to job, and life expectancy increases. \u201cIt is a very important step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2022 China:How China\u2019s one-child policy helped to endanger its retirees\n\n\u2022 Japan:Retiring in Japan: Seniors greatly outnumber younger workers \u2014 and that\u2019s a big problem for everyone\n\n\u2022 Brazil:Brazil wants to make it harder to become a retiree\n\n\u2022 Australia:Australia\u2019s safety net for retirees is generous and comprehensive \u2014 and complicated\n\n\u2022 Sweden:Sweden partially privatized its Social Security \u2014 here\u2019s how it has worked out\n\n\u2022 The United States:Social Security is a lifeline for many older Americans, but how will it be funded in the future?", "description": "Contributions must ramp up to make a difference", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ773_UK_SS_ZG_20190905151940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
