But I had an opportunity to do it and I couldn't do it.\n\n'I do want to do it (acting). I auditioned for a movie a while ago and it took one day to learn the role.\n\n'I had a fashion show in Paris and I probably had maybe four or five shows to go to, so in between I quickly changed and saw this (acting) coach, and I saw her for 20 minutes and we quickly went through one part and then I went to a show and came back and went through another part.\n\nThe Formula One driver has previously worked as a fashion designer with Tommy Hilfiger\n\nTom Cruise gives a thumbs up on the set of Tony Scott's 1986 movie Top Gun\n\nCruise starred alongside Kelly McGillis\n\n'By the end of the day I had to record a video to send it to Los Angeles - it was so cool!\n\n'But I didn't get the part - it was a big part! There was no way I was going to get this part, I think! Someone like Kurt Russell got it, well not Kurt Russell, but someone who works alongside him. I knew I wasn't going to get it!'\n\nThere are 21 race weekends over the course of the F1 season, a number that will rise to 22 in 2020, and Hamilton has admitted it is unlikely he will be able to work in film before retiring from driving.\n\n'I definitely don't have time for movies (right now). It would take up my whole winter so I wouldn't get a break, so that's the difficult thing that I'm struggling with right now.\n\nHamilton could win the F1 Drivers Championship for a sixth time in Mexico this weekend\n\nThe film poster for Top Gun: Maverick\n\n'If you saw my calendar\u2026 it's super heavy-loaded and I'm trying to take days out to give myself some time back, so I can be the best that I can be here (in F1). So it is just trying to find a balance.\n\n'At the end of the year, you really want to soak up the relaxation. I have all these things I want to do: I want to design that, work on my music - but that means time away from family and time away from training and all these different things.\n\n'You have always got to keep an eye on the most important thing and the ultimate goal and that's being the best in this job, because that enables all the other things to happen. If I am not winning here, then all the other things just get squidgy.'\n\nThe Stevenage-born driver is under no illusion about the challenges facing actors, and accepts he will need plenty of training before starring on screen.\n\n'I don't know if I'm going to be good at acting. I don't know if I am ever going to be good at movies, but I'll give it a try.\n\n'You look at a lot of people that do it and they are not really good\u2026 and I know how hard it is for any craft, because it's taken me years to master what I do.\n\nThe 34-year-old says he has 'a lot of ground to cover' in order to succeed in the film industry\n\nTITLE PERMUTATIONS 1 - Lewis Hamilton can seal the world championship on Sunday if he wins and Valtteri Bottas comes no higher than fifth\n\n'I know in anything, whatever it may be, to master a craft it takes so much time and effort. But because I have experienced it in Formula One, I understand that and appreciate that.\n\n'So I know if I do movies, I have to put so much work in and have so much ground to cover. I don't know if I will ever have time for that because the fashion stuff is also going to take a lot of my time.'\n\nOn the track, Hamilton will win the F1 Drivers Championship for a sixth time if he can beat Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas by 14 points or more in Mexico this weekend.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton his revealed his busy Formula 1 schedule prevented him from making an appearance on the big screen in upcoming film Top Gun: Maverick.", "authors": ["Tom Caldon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/11/20174390-0-image-a-2_1571997620917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
