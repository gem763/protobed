A fourth man, Jon Ransom, 63, of Sheerness, Kent, denies the offence.\n\nOpening the case against Ransom, Don Tait, prosecuting, claimed he and three others, Frank Walling and Glen Bennett, from Lancashire, and Keith Plummer, from Kent, were involved in bringing 29 Vietnamese people from France to the UK.\n\nTait said: \u201cThey were brought over in a yacht. Once they had disembarked they were put in the back of a van and transported away from Newlyn. The van was stopped on the M5.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that the yacht, the Johan Sebastian, sailed from Roscoff in north-west France and arrived at the fishing port of Newlyn, west Cornwall, on the morning of 12 April.\n\nTait said the vessel, crewed by Walling and Bennett, tied up in the harbour at about 7am. \u201cTo the amazement of locals, a large number of foreign nationals were seen to disembark,\u201d the barrister said.\n\nThe Vietnamese men, women and children walked to shore along a pontoon and footbridge and got into the back of of a white van. It was driven off by Plummer and Ransom allegedly followed in a blue Audi TT, the court was told.\n\nThe van and the Audi were stopped in Cullompton, Devon, and Plummer and Ransom were arrested. Walling and Bennett had gone for breakfast at the Harbour Cafe in Newlyn, where they were also arrested.\n\nWhen he was pulled over on the M5, a police officer told Ransom he was being arrested on suspicion of human trafficking.\n\nHe told the officer: \u201cWhat\u2019s it got to do with me?\u201d and continued: \u201cIt seems a bit drastic. All I\u2019m doing is driving along the road \u2026 There seems to be a lot of people here for me.\u201d\n\nA service station worker, William Ives, who allegedly served Plummer and Ransom the night before they were arrested told the court he had thought they were \u201caverage guys on a removal job\u201d.\n\nIn a statement read out to the court, Newlyn fish market worker Dale Frisk said he saw the Vietnamese people jumping off the boat and heading to the waiting van. \u201cI counted 28 people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were diving over the wall and into a van.\u201d\n\nFrederick Bates, who works on the harbourside mending fishing nets, said: \u201cThis was a really unusual sight, especially at 7am.\u201d He said the people he had seen were \u201cfairly young\u201d.\n\nTait showed the jury images of the yacht. The hull was stained and the interior cramped and dirty. There were cans of beans and Pot Noodles in cupboards, a stained sink and one blocked toilet.\n\nWhen he was interviewed by police, Tait said Ransom was \u201crambling and unclear\u201d. He suggested he had been in Cornwall to book a holiday at a caravan park \u2013 but the spot he named was in Somerset rather than Cornwall.\n\nRansom denies assisting unlawful immigration to an EU country under section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Van stopped on M5 after group, which included children, arrived in Cornish port", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c024572f1a04799d1800b2bae5ca861758db65ab/407_0_2077_1246/master/2077.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1425f2efa38307acf717579595d80e80", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
