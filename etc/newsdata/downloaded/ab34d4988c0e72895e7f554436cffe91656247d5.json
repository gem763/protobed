It provided a list of the dead, all males under the age of 30 and including a 14-year-old schoolboy called Boubacar Diallo.\n\nThe coalition said in a statement that a further 70 protesters had been wounded by bullets and 200 people had been arrested. Police raided homes and assaulted family members of the dead, it said.\n\nThe government did not respond to these allegations.\n\nConde\u2019s second and final five-year term expires in 2020 but the 81-year-old leader has refused to rule out running again. He asked his government last month to look into drafting a new constitution, raising concerns that he might use it as a reset button on his presidency and run again.\n\nExtending his mandate would mark a turnaround for Conde who as an opposition leader railed against militarized, autocratic regimes.\n\nHis first election win in 2010 raised hopes for democratic progress in Guinea after two years of military rule and nearly a quarter a century under authoritarian President Lansana Conte, who died in 2008.\n\nHowever, tinkering with term limits or eliminating them altogether has been part of the playbook of African rulers even during a recent push toward democracy in parts of the region.\n\nRwanda\u2019s Paul Kagame and Congo Republic\u2019s Denis Sassou Nguesso easily pushed through new constitutions in 2015 that allowed them to stay in power.\n\nEven measures ostensibly passed to introduce term limits have been used to extend mandates.\n\nIn Chad, a new constitution passed last year reimposed a two-term limit scrapped in a 2005 referendum. But it will not be applied retroactively, meaning President Idriss Deby could serve two six-year terms after the next election in 2021.\n\nA change in Togo\u2019s law voted through in May capped mandates to two five-year terms. But like Chad it was not retroactive and could allow longstanding President Faure Gnassingbe to stay in power until 2030, extending his family\u2019s rule to 63 years.", "description": "Nine protesters were killed this week in Guinea during demonstrations against a possible change to the constitution that could let President Alpha Conde seek a third term, the government said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Saliou Samb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
