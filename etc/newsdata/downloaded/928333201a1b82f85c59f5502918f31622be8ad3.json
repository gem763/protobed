The inspector general testified Friday behind closed doors before the three House committee leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe president's call with Zelensky was held on the morning of July 25. The whistleblower wrote the memo the next day after speaking with the official in the afternoon. The whistleblower wrote that he or she spoke with the White House official for \"a few minutes,\" and summarized their conversation.\n\nAccording to the memo, the White House official described the contents of the call as \"crazy,\" \"frightening\" and \"completely lacking in substance related to national security.\"\n\nThe whistleblower said the official was \"visibly shaken by what had transpired and seemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the U.S. national security apparatus about the call.\"\n\nThe whistleblower's summary of the White House official's account of the call largely comports with the call record released by the White House, though some details are missing.\n\nThe full text of the memo, as described to CBS News:\n\n26 July 2019\n\nThe following is a record of a conversation I had this afternoon with a White House official about the telephone call yesterday morning between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The official who listened to the entirety of the phone call was visibly shaken by what had transpired and seemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the U.S. national security apparatus about the call. After my call with this official I [redacted] returned to my office, and wrote up my best recollection of what I had heard.\n\n\n\nThe official described the call as \"crazy,\" \"frightening\" and \"completely lacking in substance related to national security.\" The official asserted that the President used the call to persuade Ukrainian authorities to investigate his political rivals, chiefly former Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. The official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official's view, the President had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own reelection bid in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe phone call lasted approximately half an hour. The two leaders spoke through interpreters. My conversation with the official only lasted a few minutes, and as a result, I only received highlights:\n\nThe President asserted that \"it all started in Ukraine,\" referring to the allegations of foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the subsequent investigation into the Trump campaign's contact with Russian individuals\n\nThe President asked Zelenskyy to locate the \"Crowdstrike server\" and turn it over to the United States, claiming that Crowdstrike is \"a Ukrainian company,\" (Note: This appears to be a reference to the DNC server from which Russian hackers stole data and emails that were subsequently leaked in mid-2016; the DNC hired cyber security firm Crowdstrike to do the forensic analysis, which informed the FBI's investigation. It is not clear what the president was referring to when he claimed Crowdstrike is a Ukrainian company; one of its cofounders was born in Moscow.)\n\nThe President told Zelenskyy that he would be sending his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to Ukraine soon and requested that Zelenskyy meet with him. Zelenskyy reluctantly agreed that, if Giuliani traveled to Ukraine, he would see him.\n\nThe President raised the case of Burisma Holdings, Hunter Biden's role in the company, and former Vice President Biden's role in setting Ukraine policy. The President urged Zelenskyy to [end page 1] investigate the Bidens and stated that Giuliani would discuss this topic further with Zelenskyy during his trip to Kyiv.\n\nThe President urged Zelenskyy not to fire Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, who the President claimed was doing a good job. (Note: Lutsenko has spearheaded various politicized investigations, including on Burisma Holdings and alleged \"Ukrainian interference\" in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Lutsenko is widely reviled in Ukraine, and Zelenskyy has pledged to fire him but has been unable to secure approval from the legislature.)\n\nThe President stated that he wanted Attorney General William Barr to speak with Zelenskyy as soon as possible. (Note: It was not clear whether this conversation was to be in reference to Crowdstrike or the investigations of the Bidens.)\n\nThe President reiterated his concern that Zelenskyy was surrounded by people who were enemies of the President, including \"bad oligarchs.\"\n\nThe President did not raise security assistance. According to the official, Zelenskyy demurred in response to most of the President's requests.\n\n\n\nI did not review a transcript or written notes, but the official informed me that they exist.", "description": "The memo, dated July 26, is based on a conversation the whistleblower had with an unnamed White House official who listened to the call", "authors": ["Arden Farhi"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/09/9c19b19a-d35d-425d-a8b2-872ff15e931d/thumbnail/1200x630/1b8071c73f7c596e60d91c310afd0d5f/gettyimages-1171051032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
