This is a rather glaring contradiction of President Trump\u2019s justification for pulling out of Syria in the first place, that it was time to bring the troops home. But if you were worried that a complete pullout of U.S. troops would leave us with no options to attack any reconstituted ISIS forces, at least with this decision we\u2019ll have some forces not so far away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis doesn\u2019t do much to mitigate the abandonment of the Kurds; even usually pro-Trump Republicans like Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee are lamenting the \u201cgrave consequences for U.S. national security and our allies and partners in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the details, but the mission in Syria remains what the mission in Syria began with.
