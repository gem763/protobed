Reuters\n\nOff we went again (this from a Great Western News Agency) on the whirligig clich\u00e9s of Trumpian \u201cforeign policy\u201d. Trump had faced \u201ca cascade of \u2026 global challenges\u201d while experiencing \u201ca trying moment \u2026 on the world stage\u201d and Bolton had opposed his president\u2019s desire to talk to \u201csome of the world\u2019s most unsavoury actors\u201d.\n\nAfter the Great North Korean Leader, for heaven\u2019s sake, and the deputy Iranian supreme leader and the heroic Taliban, who might Trump want to chat to next? The Great Syrian Leader, perhaps?\n\nI will leave readers to savour the adjective \u201cunsavoury\u201d \u2013 which western experts will never use about Messers al-Sissi (with his 60,000 Egyptian political prisoners) or Mohammad bin Salman (of surgical fame) or various other democrats in Brazil and elsewhere. But the clich\u00e9s of \u201cstages\u201d and \u201cactors\u201d innocently betrayed what this was all about. Foreign policy doesn\u2019t exist any more in many world capitals. Only the ghostly wreckage of the theatre remains.\n\nTake that infamous Iranian oil tanker which our brave chaps took over off Gibraltar. Released after the Iranians stole a British-flagged tanker off Hormuz, the mysteriously renamed \u201cAdrian Darya 1\u201d sailed off into the sunset, allegedly towards Greece but inevitably towards Syria, where Bolton \u2013 in one of his last acts \u2013 claimed it was going to off-load its oil at Tartus, where Russia has a naval base. Not bad, but no cigar.\n\nIn fact, according to a most trusted Syrian contact (I give my source a 90 per cent accuracy record), the tanker had already shifted half its oil cargo into the Syrian port of Banias (not as romantic as Tartus, but just as efficient) by the time Bolton spoke.\n\nAnd now, no one cares about the tanker anymore. Trump can hardly bomb the vessel \u2013 it would anyway be empty \u2013 now that his chief warmonger has himself sunk beneath the waters of the Potomac. And given the Shakespearean comedy being played out in Downing Street\u2019s own lunatic asylum, we can be assured that Her Imperial Majesty\u2019s Royal Navy will not intervene. And that\u2019s the real problem.\n\nIran knows all about mad leaders and is more than happy for the world \u2013 or the \u201cworld stage\u201d \u2013 to know that it has given oil to its loyal Arab ally in Damascus. And Assad will be more than content for his enemies to know that Iran keeps it word when Syrians are queuing for miles and days at gas stations. So stand by for the next Iranian tanker to steam \u2013 without the slightest \u201clet or hindrance\u201d by our chaps, I bet you \u2013 past The Rock.\n\nReturning briefly to clich\u00e9dom, Bolton\u2019s submergence was naturally attributed by my favourite news agency to Trump\u2019s inevitably scrapped plans to chat to the lads from the Taliban, who were to have been imported to the US for a little American hospitality. This, it was said, was \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u201ca bridge too far\u201d for Bolton. Why Cornelius Ryan\u2019s fine book on Arnhem (and the equally brilliant epic film of the same World War Two battle) had to be dragged into this was anyone\u2019s guess. But the \u201cbridge too far\u201d was now not at Camp David but in Jerusalem.\n\nAnd scarcely a paragraph of emotion did it provoke from our Middle East experts \u2013 save for the old UN donkey, of course \u2013 when Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would annex virtually all of the occupied Palestinian West Bank to Israeli sovereignty if he wins next week\u2019s Israeli elections.\n\nThis would mean that there would never be a Palestinian state \u2013 ever. We are, of course, all used to national leaders who threaten to annex other people\u2019s countries for nationalist expansion \u2013 but this would be on a scale of colonial plunder quite unimaginable even 10 years ago.\n\nBut no more. \u201cThis is a historical opportunity...\u201d quoth Netanyahu. Trump, whose infamous \u201cpeace plan\u201d is supposed to shower the Palestinians with (Arab) cash after the elimination of their hopes of statehood, said nothing. Nor did our own equivalent nincompoop in London; he was far too busy with his own constitutional tomfoolery to worry about the annihilation of a people\u2019s hopes, let alone their constitution.\n\nThis is what happens when madmen take power in democratic countries; little madmen run amok and millions pay the price.\n\nIt was somehow appropriate that a Turkish newspaper would attempt to stage a re-run \u201cexclusive\u201d of the butchering of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2013 including his \u201clast words\u201d, although they were all publicly reported in an excellent UN document months ago. It was presumably a Turkish government attempt to remind the \u201cworld stage\u201d that next month marks the anniversary of the man\u2019s evisceration in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. We\u2019d forgotten we had read it all before.\n\nIn other words, the Sultan Erdogan merely wished once more to frighten his Saudi antagonists. This was truly Ottoman.\n\nAnd strangely, the Sick Man of Europe \u2013 as the Russians and then the British once called Turkey for its gradual impotence amid the crazed political and military decisions taken during and after the First World War \u2013 has now been replaced by another Sick Man of Europe and another Sick Man in America.\n\nThat\u2019s how empires dissolve: when satraps still take their false caliphs seriously, ignore their incurable mental distress, and pay no attention to the outrageous behaviour of their attendant lords. Goodbye to the poor and huddled masses. After that, the bad guys will come along to make fun of them all.", "description": "The sanest comment to emerge this week from the latest fandango in the Washington lunatic asylum came from Iran.", "authors": ["Robert Fisk"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/20/Benjamin-Netanyahu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
