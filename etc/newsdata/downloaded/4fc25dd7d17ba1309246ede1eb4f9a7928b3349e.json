The arm tats. The wraparound shades worn on both the front and back of one\u2019s head. The flame-covered bowling shirts, and the chains, and the pinkie rings and the goatee. And a pose, obviously: an aggressive point at the camera, or maybe a double-handed hook-\u2019em horns.\n\nSo familiar is the visual vocabulary of Guy Fieri that of course people, when presented with the task of coming up with a Halloween costume that they don\u2019t have to constantly explain (\u201cI\u2019m a whistleblower, get it?\u201d), would dress up as the instantly recognizable human cartoon known as the Mayor of Flavortown. Dressing up as Guy Fieri is a full-on thing \u2014 and nobody is embracing this tradition more than Guy Fieri, who presumably knows a thing or two about dressing up as Guy Fieri.\n\n[It\u2019s almost Halloween, and \u2018feetloaf\u2019 is already giving us nightmares]\n\nOn Monday, the \u201cDiners, Drive-ins and Dives\u201d host tweeted an invitation for people to share pictures of their winner-winner-Halloween-dinner lewks. \u201cI\u2019ll be retweetin\u2019 the best costumes from now \u2018till the 31st,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTreat this tweet as the official chain for allllll those pics of you all dressed up as me for Halloween. I\u2019ll be retweetin\u2019 the best costumes from now \u2018till the 31st \ud83d\udc7b \u2014 Guy Fieri (@GuyFieri) October 29, 2019\n\nPeople have been dressing up as Fieri for years. In what might have been one of the most high-concept versions of this, Rocco DiSpirito in 2013 was half Guy, half Giada De Laurentiis. Chrissy Teigen donned some spot-on Guy apparel in 2015. Mario Batali did it in 2011, long before sexual harassment allegations cast him out of the celebrity chef club, prompting Fieri to retaliate a few years later with his own orange-Croc-and-Vespa Batali costume.\n\n[Guy Fieri\u2019s fried chicken stand at FedEx Field is a mess. A tasty mess.]\n\nAnd the TV chef has shown before that he\u2019s all-in on the joke. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny,\u201d he once told People magazine, describing how he sometimes spots look-alike trick-or-treaters when he\u2019s out with his kids. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. You gotta be able to laugh. You gotta be able to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Fieri-fication of Halloween started early, when a picture of what looked like a copyright-avoiding costume went viral. The kit promised to turn a partygoer into the \u201cGovernor of Tasteville\u201d and included \u201csunglasses, fake goatee, bowling shirt, donkey sauce\u201d \u2014 but, alas, Mashable determined it was a photoshopped fake.\n\nan impostor shall come to you\n\nhe shall speak pleasing words and promise you the world\n\nbut in his name you shall know him a fraud pic.twitter.com/kjobzExQsm \u2014 Sam Sykes (@SamSykesSwears) October 20, 2019\n\nStill, even without the aid of a prepackaged get-up, it seems that making like Fieri is a pretty easy DIY.\n\nThis \u201cGuy\u201d and his Ghoulish Games Trunk or Treat. pic.twitter.com/a1MOuVnzga \u2014 teamplaidmd (@teamplaidmd) October 29, 2019\n\nThis is off the hook \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/petCJJNt3a \u2014 Guy Fieri (@GuyFieri) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd in addition to straight-up copies, there were variations on the theme of Guy:\n\nThis year\u2019s Halloween costume?
