It was inappropriate and we apologise for this mistake.\u201d\n\nThe local police approach to the good-natured invasion had been somewhat more measured, advising those who pitched up to watch out for rattlesnakes and setting out some rudimentary ground rules.\n\nThis was not the first time the US military has been obliged to say sorry for posting inappropriate tweets.\n\nOn December 31, US Strategic Command, which is responsible for the country\u2019s strategic arsenal apologised for a tweet saying it was ready, if necessary, to drop something \u201cmuch, much bigger\u201d than the New Year\u2019s Eve ball in New York.", "description": "The US military has apologised for threatening to deploy a stealth bomber on millennials who had been planning to \u201cstorm\u201d the Area 51 test base in the Nevada desert.
