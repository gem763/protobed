He was being dragged along the ground and then hit a wooden fence and just kept going. The momentum just kept carrying him.\n\n(Image: Jeanette Harman)\n\n(Image: Jeanette Harman)\n\n\"Then he just stopped and was quite still.\"\n\nSt John Ambulance advanced first aider Jeanette went straight into auto pilot.\n\n\"I told my partner to grab my first aid bag and I ran over to the man,\" said Jeanette.\n\n\"I was calling to him 'are you alright?' and he wasn't responding.\n\n\"When I got to him I could see he was bleeding badly from his left femur. I knew we had to stop the bleeding urgently because you can bleed out within four minutes.\n\n\"Other people came from nowhere. One man put his knee in the patient's groin to apply pressure and try and stop the bleeding. I gave him a tourniquet to help. Meanwhile I kept applying pressure to his leg.\n\n\"We could see he had lost all of his skin on his legs and he was floating in and out of consciousness. He kept shouting 'my leg!, my leg!'\n\n\"His breathing then changed and someone produced a defibrillator and we got it ready to use.\"\n\nLittle did Jeanette know that the instructor had suffered a serious head injury, broken collarbone and wrist and possible spinal injury and time was critical.\n\nShe treated the patient for a further 20 minutes before the air ambulance arrived at Hinton Skydiving Centre.\n\nThe Liverpool FC fan added: \"When the air ambulance arrived the doctors just got him out of there as quick as possible.\n\n\"I knew it was quite bad and didn't think the man would live. I didn't want bad news but my partner called for updates.\"\n\nThe instructor spent eight months in hospital and was discharged in March this year. He is undergoing further rehab.\n\nJeanette, from Weedon, Northamptonshire, said: \"Apparently it was touch and go for a couple of weeks but he's out of hospital now.\n\n\"At the time the training kicks in and that's all you think about. This is the process I've been taught. We needed to act together as a team.\"\n\nJeanette will be among the nominees and finalists honoured at St John Ambulance\u2019s Everyday Heroes awards, held at the Hilton London Bankside on Monday evening.\n\nThey will be celebrated for their bravery, courage and lifesaving skills at the annual event which honours individuals, volunteers and teams who step forward in their communities and in the moments that matter to help loved ones, colleagues, customers or even strangers in need.\n\nAs well as recognition for young people, Everyday Heroes also rewards the kindness of strangers, colleagues and St John volunteers in three other categories: Community Hero, Workplace Hero and Volunteer Hero.\n\nNow in its eighth year, the awards will be hosted for the second time by Reverend Richard Coles, celebrity vicar and one half of 80s band The Communards.\n\nFor more information visit sja.org.uk", "description": "The instructor had suffered a serious head injury and was bleeding out and Jeanette Harman had just minutes to save him", "authors": ["Andy Rudd", "Image", "Jeanette Harman"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20396220.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jeanette-Harman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
