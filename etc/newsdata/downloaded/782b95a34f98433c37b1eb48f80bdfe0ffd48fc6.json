His defense attorneys said on Tuesday that Ardon's testimony was not backed by any physical evidence.\n\nThe president has denied taking money from Guzman or other drug traffickers..\n\nArdon testified that Tony Hernandez had promised El Chapo that his cocaine shipments through the Central American country would be protected if his brother won the presidency in 2013.\n\nIn response, Guzman offered to give $1 million to the 2013 campaign to elect Juan Orlando Hernandez, now the president, Ardon told jurors. In a later meeting, Ardon said, El Chapo handed the money to Tony Hernandez.\n\nGuzman was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a sentence of life in prison. One of his lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, has denied that his client paid Juan Orlando Hernandez.\n\nArdon, who was once mayor of the town of El Paraiso, had first testified about the payment on Monday, but on Tuesday offered more detail about the discussions between Guzman and Tony Hernandez leading up to it.\n\nArdon turned himself in to U.S. authorities in March and is cooperating with prosecutors. He admitted on Monday that he had been responsible for 56 murders.\n\nResponding to the allegations, President Hernandez tweeted Tuesday, \"CONFESSED KILLER of 56 people who lives with a profound hate and thirst for vengeance against me. The conspiracy is CLEAR among confessed criminals who have nothing to lose.\"\n\nIn addition to protection for his drug shipments, Ardon said, Guzman wanted assurances that his partners in the country - drug trafficking brothers Luis and Arnulfo Valle, and Ardon - would not be extradited to the United States.\n\nJuan Orlando Hernandez won the presidency in 2013, and took office in January 2014. When the Valle brothers were arrested in 2014, Ardon said he personally conveyed Guzman's displeasure to the president.\n\n\"I told Juan Orlando Hernandez that was the reason he had been paid the $1 million, to protect the Valles,\" he said. The president countered that he had no obligation to anyone, and offered to give the money back, Ardon said.\n\nU.S. prosecutors have said Tony Hernandez, with the protection of his brother, moved tons of cocaine into the United States, some of it stamped with his initials, and took part in two drug-related murders.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has supported Juan Orlando Hernandez, a conservative, as a staunch ally in the fight against drug trafficking. In Honduras he has faced mounting popular opposition since he was sworn in for a second term in January 2018 despite allegations of electoral fraud.
