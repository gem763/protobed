Trump's comments about a potential China probe came shortly after he discussed how the two superpowers are locked in intense trade negotiations.\n\nTrump noted \u2014 also unprompted \u2014 that Chinese negotiators would be in town next week as the high-stakes trade talks resume, with potentially billions of dollars in tariffs on the line.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of options on China,\u201d he said of the trade talks, \u201cbut if they don't do what we want, we have tremendous power.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly hammered Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings over the last few weeks as he's defended urging the Ukrainian president to open an investigation during a July phone call. That call, and a whistleblower complaint raising alarms about his request, have landed the president in the middle of an impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\nThursday\u2019s comments by the president came as House lawmakers grilled behind closed doors the first witness for their impeachment investigation, Trump\u2019s former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker.\n\nTrump\u2019s public appeals for foreign governments to probe a potential political opponent \u2014 Biden is one of the top contenders to take on Trump in next year's election \u2014 was reminiscent of the Russia probe that engulfed the first half of Trump\u2019s first term, which examined, in part, his 2016 invitation for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a leader of the House's impeachment inquiry and one of Trump's chief congressional foes, reiterated in a tweet that \"the President cannot use the power of his office to pressure foreign leaders to investigate his political opponents.\"\n\nTrump's \"rant this morning reinforces the urgency of our work,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Capitol after reemerging from Volker's testimony, Schiff went even further, calling Trump's overtures \"repugnant\" and \"a fundamental breach of the president's oath of office.\"\n\nHe cast the developments as a direct result of a lack of accountability, contending that the president's behavior \"is an illustration that this president, if he's learned anything from the two years of the Mueller investigation, it's that he feels he can do anything with impunity.\"\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi was just as blunt, writing in a tweet that his remarks Thursday are \"just the latest example of him putting his personal political gain ahead of defending the integrity of our elections.\"\n\n\u201cThe president has confessed to a violation of his oath of office\u201d she later told reporters in Weston, Fla. \u201cOur founding fathers were very suspicious of foreign interference in our government.\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies have claimed that Hunter Biden convinced China to put $1.5 billion in a fund for an investment firm he had a stake in, assertions lawyers for the former vice president's son have denied. George Mesires, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, has told multiple media outlets that he did not have a financial stake in the firm until after his father left public office.\n\nBiden critics have pointed to a trip to China in 2013 that Joe Biden took while vice president. Hunter and his daughter accompanied his father on the trip, where he arranged a meeting between the vice president and a Chinese banker involved with the firm, though Hunter Biden's lawyer denied any business was conducted on the trip.\n\nThe president and his allies have also suggested that Biden used his father's influence to get ahead in business \u2014 Trump accused Biden on Thursday of giving China a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d due to his son\u2019s business interests there. He also accused Hunter Biden, without evidence, of receiving a \u201cpayoff\u201d from the Chinese.\n\nMesires told The Washington Post last week that Hunter had not received \u201cany return or compensation\u201d from his investment or role with the firm, and that Trump and his defenders had engaged in a \u201cgross misrepresentation\u201d of Hunter\u2019s role there.\n\nThe former vice president has also forcefully denied any wrongdoing by himself or his son and has repeatedly insisted he and Hunter did not discuss his business interests.\n\nAt the White House on Thursday, Trump predicted that the Bidens' business dealings would weigh heavily on the former vice president's campaign.\n\n\u201cWell, I think Biden is going down, and I think his whole situation, because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scam just like they scam China and Ukraine,\" Trump said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence continued to defend Trump on Thursday, but did not directly address a question from reporters about the president's latest entreaty to Beijing and instead defended Trump's request of Zelenksy.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

That is about looking backwards and understanding what really happened,\" he told reporters during a trip to Arizona, asserting that Trump's push falls under his campaign promise to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\n\"I mean, the fact that my predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a Ukrainian board, at the time that Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration's efforts in Ukraine, I think it's worth looking into,\" Pence continued. \"And the president made it very clear that he believes other nations around the world should look into it, as well.\"\n\nPence also argued that the business dealings of the Biden family were fair game because of the \"unique responsibilities\" that came with his position of power. Biden, he said, should have worked as vice president to avoid not just impropriety, but even the \"appearance of impropriety,\" an accusation that mirrored claims often leveled against Trump and his adult children by Democrats.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, reacted with indignation to the president\u2019s latest pronouncements.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign shredded the president in a statement put out shortly after Trump lifted off from the White House lawn, claiming that the \u201cdefining characteristic of Donald Trump's presidency is the ongoing abuse of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election's equivalent of his infamous 'Russia, if you're listening' moment from 2016 \u2014 a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country,\u201d deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said. \u201cThe White House itself has admitted that Donald Trump tried to bully a foreign country into lying about the domestic opponent he's afraid to look in the eye next November.\u201d\n\nBedingfield accused the president of \u201cdesperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations,\u201d and called his foreign overtures proof that the president is threatened by Biden\u2019s candidacy.\n\nAt least one of Biden\u2019s rivals for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Kamala Harris, also came to his defense, warning in a tweet directed at Trump that \u201ctelling lies about Joe Biden won't protect you from the truth.\u201d Others reiterated their calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nSchiff issued a challenge to his Republican colleagues in Congress, declaring that Trump's outreach \"endangers our elections, it endangers our national security. It ought to be condemned by every member of this body, Democrats and or Republicans alike.\"\n\nClinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent who only recently leaned in fully to calling for impeachment, wrote on Twitter that \u201cSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count.\u201d\n\nEllen Weintraub, the Democratic head of the Federal Election Commission also weighed in, re-upping a June statement clarifying the commission\u2019s guidelines about foreign interference in American elections. \u201cIs this thing on?\u201d she wrote, adding a microphone emoji.\n\nAndrew Desiderio and Marc Caputo contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/3257/1155968404_6091759372001_6091757354001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"}
