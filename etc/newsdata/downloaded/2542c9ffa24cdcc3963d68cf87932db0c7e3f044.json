REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo\n\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Friday said European Union officials were working intensively to hammer out a broader trade deal with the United States and avert additional, potentially far more devastating tariffs on European-built cars.\n\nAsked about new U.S. tariffs on up to $7.5 billion worth of EU airplanes, cheese, wine and other imports that took effect on Friday, Scholz said he favoured a \u201cfirm, clear and decisive\u201d approach that did not further escalate the situation.\n\n\u201cI think it will work at the end of the day,\u201d he told reporters during the IMF/World Bank annual meetings.\n\nIn Brussels, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said the EU would respond with its own tariffs \u201cin due course\u201d when its own case against Boeing (BA.N) is adjudicated in early 2020.\n\nDespite some initial suggestions it could do so, there was no move by Brussels to impose any immediate retaliatory tariffs against the United States under earlier WTO rulings.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday said the EU was working on measures to compensate sectors hit by the new U.S. duties and \u201climit damages for those directly hit.\u201d\n\nThe WTO has found that both Airbus (AIR.PA) and its U.S. rival Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. The U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports took effect Friday.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s dispute settlement body on Monday cleared Washington to take the record countermeasures against the EU and Airbus-producing countries Britain, France, Germany and Spain.\n\nThe actions include 10% duties on Airbus planes and additional 25% duties on a wide swath of French wine, Scottish whiskies and cheeses from across Europe.\n\nFifteen international beverage groups on Friday urged the U.S. and EU governments to end the tariffs.\n\n\u201cOur industries are collateral damage in trade disputes that have nothing to do with the beverage alcohol sector,\u201d the groups said in a statement. \u201cThis new round of tariffs will further damage a transatlantic industry that has already been negatively impacted by the EU\u2019s retaliatory tariff on American Whiskey.\u201d\n\nThey said the new U.S. tariffs on EU spirits and wines could result in the loss of 8,000 good-paying jobs across the U.S. beverage alcohol sector, from importers, distributors, wholesalers, to the hospitality sector.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have recently downplayed tensions with Brussels, raising the prospect that they could once again delay threatened national security tariffs against European cars. A decision is due by Nov. 14.", "description": "European officials struck a measured tone on Friday after the United States imposed new 10% and 25% tariffs on some European Union goods over aircraft subsidies, with a top German official warning against steps that could escalate the tensions.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442404086&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1VM", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
