accused of 1972 murder of soldiers denied bail", "language": "en", "text": "A man being prosecuted for the murder of two soldiers in Northern Ireland has been refused bail.\n\nJohn Downey, accused of the murders of two Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers in August 1972 and a further explosives charge, was extradited to the UK after being arrested in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe soldiers died in a car bomb attack in Co Fermanagh.\n\nLance Corporal Alfred Johnston \u2013 a father of four \u2013 and father-of-three Private James Eames died when a device exploded in a car they were checking on the Irvinestown Road, Cherrymount, Enniskillen.\n\nDowney handed himself in to Letterkenny Garda Station on Friday after he lost an appeal to challenge his extradition in July this year.\n\nDowney was escorted into the court by a large number of police officers (Niall Carson/PA)\n\nThe 67-year-old appeared at Omagh Magistrates\u2019 Court on Saturday morning in front of District Judge Michael Ranaghan.\n\nDressed in a white shirt and blue jumper, Downey appeared in the dock flanked by a police officer, while his family sat in court and gestured to him.\n\nPSNI Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell told the court: \u201cPolice object to bail for the defendant on the grounds that he is a flight risk.\n\n\u201cThe defendant did not consent to be extradited and appealed to High Court in Dublin.\u201d\n\nMr Caldwell went on to list the number of hearings Downey had gone through to fight extradition in the Republic of Ireland, before stating: \u201cIn light of all of this, police are of the view the defendant doesn\u2019t want to face trial in Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nSamuel Magee QC, for the prosecution, said Brexit could also pose a challenge in the case.\n\nHe told the court: \u201cMr Downey has challenged extradition all the way.\n\n\u201cIn police custody last night we got the defendant\u2019s passport which he brought with him, however he could easily leave and go to the Republic and with all the uncertainty around Brexit, that could frustrate the justice process.\u201d\n\nBut Downey\u2019s barrister Michael Duffy said the accused is not a flight risk as he has nowhere else to go.\n\nDowney was denied bail after the judge agreed with police and prosecutors that he is a flight risk (Niall Carson/PA)\n\nHe told the court: \u201cFirst of all, this is a 67-year-old man, he\u2019s married with children, there are no issues in relation to this man not complying with all conditions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere this man can go, his family are grounded where he lives, and has lived all his married life, he is a man of ill health with chronic conditions, and that should be taken into consideration.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence the accused has committed any actual act in the 47 years since the alleged crime.\u201d\n\nMr Duffy added that by appealing against his extradition, Downey was justifiably engaging with the legal process.\n\nMr Ranaghan agreed, adding: \u201cHuman rights are there for a reason.\u201d\n\nMr Duffy concluded any trial would be a lengthy and complicated one, adding it would be an \u201caffront to justice\u201d not to grant bail.\n\nMr Ranaghan took a recess in his chamber for several minutes before making his decision, and then said: \u201cThis is far from straightforward.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of matters that point toward granting bail, I have considered Mr Downey\u2019s age and health, and the strength of the evidence.\n\n\u201cThis will be a long and protracted matter with numerous pretrial issues.\n\nDowney was put into a police van after being denied bail at the hearing (Niall Carson/PA)\n\n\u201cOn the other side of the coin, the charge couldn\u2019t be more grave.\n\n\u201cI am conducting a risk assessment here in the circumstances, and I find he is a flight risk, and so I do refuse bail.\n\nHe told Downey he has the right to appeal against that decision.\n\nA large crowd had gathered outside the town centre court house in support of Downey, including Sinn Fein MP for the area Orfhlaith Begley and a number of former and current Sinn Fein representatives including ex-MP Pat Doherty.\n\nAfter the hearing, Downey was transferred from the court to a waiting police van.\n\nCrowds shouted support for the accused, before a scuffle ensued between them and police officers after PSNI had attempted to move supporters and the press from the road.\n\nDowney was arrested at his home in Donegal in October last year under a European Arrest Warrant after authorities in Northern Ireland determined they had sufficient evidence to charge him with the murders of Mr Johnston, 32, and Mr Eames, 33.\n\nIn 2013, Downey was charged with murdering four Royal Household Cavalrymen in a bomb attack in London\u2019s Hyde Park in 1982.\n\nHe was tried at the Old Bailey in 2014 but the case dramatically collapsed after it was revealed he had received a written assurance from former prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s government that he was not actively wanted by the authorities.\n\nThe letter was allegedly issued under the terms of the controversial On The Runs (OTRs) scheme.", "description": "John Downey appeared at Omagh Magistrates\u00b4 Court after handing himself in on Friday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image":
