According to Bank of America, stocks have significantly outperformed bonds 94% of the time 12 months out after this has happened.\n\nAnd it's not even close, with stocks topping bonds by 23 percentage points over that time period, Bank of America notes.\n\n\"Stocks are a 'no brainer' vs. bonds,\" Bank of America analyst Savita Subramanian wrote to investors on Monday about the phenomenon.\n\nThe dividend yield on the S&P 500 on Monday stood at 1.8%, still above the 1.73% yield on the 10-year. Investors get a higher return with stocks than bonds from dividends alone, not to mention the potential for upside from the price. Historically this has been a great time to own stocks.\n\nTypical wisdom has investors make use of a \"60/40\" portfolio, which allocates 60% of investment to stocks and 40% to bonds. Subramanian said investors should rethink this strategy at times like these when stocks offer so much more value.\n\nStill investors may be afraid to buy stocks with trade war headlines holding back the S&P 500, which has been in a bull market for the last 10 years. The S&P 500 is trading just 2% higher over the last six months.\n\n\"Stocks still look cheap on growth and cash flow\" as well, Subramanian added.\n\n\u2013 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "description": "Bank of America says investors should still look to stocks for value rather than bonds.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104888688-GettyImages-875080564.jpg?v=1532563714", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
