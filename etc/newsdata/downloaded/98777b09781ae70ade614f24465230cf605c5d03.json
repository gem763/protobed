David Michaud won two fights in one night to reach the welterweight final against Ray Cooper III. At women\u2019s lightweight, undefeated Olympian Kayla Harrison won her semifinal bout to reach the final against Larissa Pacheco, who scored an upset win over Sarah Kaufman.\n\nSefo says the plan for the PFL is to do more shows in Vegas in the future.\n\n\u201cVegas is always a viable market for us,\u201d Sefo told MMA Junkie after the card at Mandalay Bay Events Center. \u201cIt\u2019s the capital fight city of the world, and so No. 1, it\u2019s good to be back because we haven\u2019t had a show here in years. It\u2019s good to be back, it\u2019s my hometown, and there\u2019s no place like Vegas. And I thought all the fighters, from the first fight to the last fight \u2013 I thought everybody showed up. I thought everybody came and wanted to be part of that championship round.\n\n\u201cAll in all, I was really happy with not only the outcome of the people that turned up. I thought half of Hawaii was here. I truly believe that Vegas is the ninth island now, so it was great to see that kind of turnout and the kind of support that Ray Cooper had was really amazing.\u201d\n\nThe finals are set to take place on Dec. 31 in New York, where fighters in six divisions will fight for not only the playoff titles for 2019, but $1 million. Sefo said next year\u2019s finals could take place in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cYou never know \u2013 we would love for that to happen,\u201d Sefo said. \u201cBut then that means the playoffs would probably be somewhere else. That being said, we would love to have the championship in Vegas, and we\u2019ll see. If everything goes according to plan, everything works out, you never know.\u201d", "description": "PFL president Ray Sefo is happy with the promotion's first 2019 playoffs event and sees Las Vegas as a viable market moving forward.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ray-sefo-pfl-2019-playoffs-1-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
