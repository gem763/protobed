It\u2019s located in the middle of bucolic southern Michigan, halfway between Lansing and Fort Wayne, 100 miles and a world away from Detroit.\n\nIt\u2019s a place called Hillsdale College, and on Saturday, May 12, Vice President Mike Pence will bless the right-leaning college\u2019s graduation ceremonies, delivering a commencement address to this year\u2019s 367-strong crop of mostly young conservatives.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve never heard of Hillsdale. Or maybe you hadn\u2019t heard about the school before it precipitated a floor fight in the Senate during tax bill negotiations last fall. But the tiny Christian college with a graduate school in statesmanship, a strong conservative bent and roots in an anti-slavery Baptist church, has long been a treasured institution in right-of-center circles\u2014known for its required classical liberal arts curriculum, its commitment to a principled conservatism, and its outreach in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened to Hillsdale lately reflects the compromises conservative institutions across the country have made following Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory: They\u2019ve accommodated themselves to the president.\n\nHillsdale\u2019s ties to Trump have multiplied since the spring of 2016, when its president, Larry Arnn, a respected conservative wiseman, threw his intellectual weight behind the real estate mogul\u2019s controversial candidacy. The school, which takes no federal funds, benefits financially from public ties to Trumpism: It advertises on Fox News and in Trump supporters\u2019 inboxes. Its alumni fill prominent roles in the administration, from speechwriters to the chief of staff for Betsy DeVos. Former White House national security spokesman Michael Anton accepted a position at Hillsdale upon his recent exit from the West Wing.\n\nThis is not a trajectory that everyone welcomes. Alumni and students of Hillsdale strain to reconcile their college\u2019s convenient accommodations to Trump with its permanent mission: to sustain and spread a coherent and inherently moral constitutional conservatism. Political clout helps keep it alive, but for Hillsdale to actually survive the current crisis on the right, many say, its academic commitments must always come first.\n\n\n\n***\n\nFounded in 1844 by devout abolitionists, Hillsdale remained a relatively unremarkable Midwestern college until the end of the 20th century, when its then president, libertarian George Roche III, refashioned the college\u2019s refusal of federal funds as an ideological opposition to big government. Roche was a talented fundraiser, but the scandalous suicide of his daughter-in-law and rumored lover in 1999 left Hillsdale\u2019s reputation in near ruin. It was up to Roche\u2019s successor, Larry Arnn\u2014founder of the Claremont Institute, a think-tank devoted to limited government and Western political tradition\u2014to rebuild the so-called conservative citadel.\n\nHillsdale\u2019s politics match a stated mission to \u201cmaintain the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith,\u201d to protect civil and religious liberty and to teach the core tenets of Western civilization. The school \u201cconsiders itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem,\u201d the mission reads , \u201ca heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.\u201d On campus, every undergraduate studies the same core curriculum: Two years of required courses in rhetoric, biology and philosophy culminate in a class on the U.S. Constitution and another in Western Heritage.\n\nArnn took office in 2000 and recast the curriculum as a public good. He expanded its offerings to include free online classes\u2014today, the most popular, \u201cIntroduction to the Constitution\u201d and \u201cConstitution 101,\u201d enroll more than 1.2 million\u2014and a network of classical charter schools . Arnn also boosted Hillsdale\u2019s prominence in Washington with the establishment of a satellite campus on Capitol Hill in 2009, the Allan P. Kirby, Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship. According to Matthew Spalding, the Hillsdale dean who oversees all D.C. programming, Kirby is where the college \u201cradiates\u201d its mission in Washington, hosting lectures and seminars on the importance of constitutional governance.\n\nSpreading the Hillsdale gospel is also what keeps the coffers full. The school professes independence from the federal government but depend heavily on private donors and advertise prolifically on network television and talk radio, using the somewhat paradoxical line, \u201cThe founders of our nation chose independence. As do we.\u201d The conservative donors Arnn has cultivated include Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak and the DeVos and Prince families . Most of Hillsdale\u2019s benefactors aren\u2019t household names or conservative leaders, however, and the majority has never set foot on campus: They\u2019re merely taken in by its widely advertised philosophy. \u201cThey\u2019re just your typical crotchety conservatives,\u201d in other words, as one Hillsdale senior whose scholarship donors made the rare visit.\n\nArnn\u2014who also teaches courses in Greco-Roman history and Shakespeare and has authored books on Winston Churchill\u2014is considered a unifying figure in conservative circles, someone who can bridge the gap between a stalwart Trump critic like Jonah Goldberg and a pro-Trump intellectual like Anton. In April 2016\u2014two months after National Review \u2019s \u201cAgainst Trump\u201d issue \u2014when many Republicans still viewed Trump with fear and disgust, Arnn praised the GOP front-runner on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show as \u201ca good and honest man\u201d and, politically, \u201cbrilliant.\u201d The following September, he and Goldberg debated Trump\u2019s mastery of constitutional principles on a panel Hillsdale hosted in D.C. \u201cI made a specific claim,\u201d Arnn defended , \u201cAnd that is the rule of law and the separation of powers are central and that Trump has spoken consistently well on it. And as far as I can find, that is true.\u201d Arnn\u2019s approval of Trump proved a harbinger for squeamish conservative intellectuals\u2019 coming around to the current president.\n\nThe new Republican reality opened fresh marketing avenues, too. The college rents email lists from the Trump campaign through a third party firm, according to two Republican digital strategists. One who\u2019d received at least five email solicitations showed POLITICO Magazine an email offering the DVD box set of Arnn\u2019s lectures on Winston Churchill in exchange for donations of $100 or more.\n\nHillsdale also shares achievements and personnel with the Trump administration and its orbit. A White House speechwriter who cut her teeth writing for Ted Cruz in the Senate, Brittany Baldwin, Hillsdale class of 2012, gets credit from former classmates for the president\u2019s most convincingly conservative remarks . And while working for the Senate Judiciary Committee, another Hillsdale alumna deftly ran the advise-and-consent process to approve Neil Gorsuch\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court. Associate White House counsel Dave Morrell graduated from Hillsdale in 2007\u2014and, three years later, so did vice presidential speechwriter Stephen Ford.\n\nBeyond the White House, House Freedom Caucus co-founder Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who are reportedly poised to jockey for the speakership when Paul Ryan retires in January, assuming Republicans hold the House, both have recent Hillsdale graduates prominently placed within their office staff.\n\n\u201cA lot of [the core curriculum] touches on questions essential to how people organize in society,\u201d said one recent graduate, now working in the Trump administration. As a Hillsdale student reading Aristotle\u2019s Politics, \u201cIt\u2019s natural that you\u2019d be thinking about how good government works\u201d\u2014and that you might wind up working in government yourself.\n\nThe Hillsdale-D.C. pipeline runs both ways. Last month, Michael Anton announced his new professional and political home would be the Kirby Center . In September 2016, under the pen name \u201cPublius Decius Mus,\u201d Anton authored a much-discussed essay for The Claremont Review of Books in support of Trump: \u201cThe Flight 93 Election.\u201d After serving in the administration, he leaped for the emergency exit upon John Bolton\u2019s appointment, but he\u2019d also been seriously eyeing a spot at the Kirby Center for several months, said Spalding in a recent interview.\n\nIn three conjoined townhouses across Massachusetts Avenue from The Heritage Foundation, Kirby hosts caucus retreats and regular dinners with members of Congress and staff to discuss finer points of constitutional governance. It\u2019s also home to several schlocky paintings of Churchill and the founding fathers, a glass-encased first edition of the Federalist Papers donated by conservative radio host Mark Levin, and two dozen or so interns each semester\u2014most, but not all, of whom work on Capitol Hill or in conservative media\u2014and a studio where The Federalist founder Ben Domenech records his daily podcast.\n\nKirby is not a think-tank and not yet a graduate school, though Spalding confirmed plans to start a Kirby-based master\u2018s program in government. It\u2019s not a locus for lobbying efforts, either. \u201cI brief chiefs of staff a lot,\u201d Spalding says, but not as a lobbyist: \u201cYou don\u2019t have Hillsdale in because they have something to say about the tax bill,\u201d he clarified. \u201cBut because they\u2019re smart and they\u2019re thinking broadly about constitutional questions and American political thought in ways that might help us grapple with our work.\u201d\n\nHe deflected a question about Trump, and when I asked whether Ryan would retire to Hillsdale, he told me that he was more focused on forming future leaders than appealing to current ones: \u201cWhat I\u2019m actually most interested in are the people that will become those people. What I\u2019m interested in is who\u2019s going to be the Paul Ryan of the future.\u201d\n\nAt this rate, it\u2019ll be someone who\u2019s gone to Hillsdale, I said. \u201cOr, they will have been shaped by us in some way,\u201d he added, by an online course they took, a classical charter school they attended, or the words of a presidential speech they heard that was penned by a Hillsdale graduate. \u201cThat\u2019s how we help save the country.\u201d\n\nDespite their boundless ambition, Kirby and Hillsdale operated in relative anonymity until their not-lobbying provoked a heated floor debate in the Senate late last year.\n\nCongressional Republicans added a levy on university endowments larger than $1 million to the tax bill. \u201cTheir main objective was to punish what they saw as a constituency of left,\u201d Spalding said. Arnn considered the provision misguided, and Spalding, for his part, invoked John Marshall and Daniel Webster to nearly every member he met: The power to tax is the power to destroy.\n\nAs Spalding recounted to me, \u201cWhen it became clear that they were going to proceed, then the question came up. Well, should there be an exemption for colleges that do not take federal funds?\u201d (It came \u201cnaturally,\u201d Spalding told me\u2014though a student who\u2019d heard a more colorful version described Spalding \u201cmarching into Mitch McConnell\u2019s office\u201d to demand the exemption.) Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, whose state has a federal-funding-free conservative college of its own , took up Hillsdale\u2019s cause and a vicious floor debate ensued: Democrats defeated the exemption, with Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley cursing the college for its refusal of federal funds \u201cbecause it wanted to have permission to discriminate in selecting students.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d never think, reviewing the record from that day , the subject of contention was once a scrappy abolitionist college in the middle-of-nowhere Michigan.\n\nBut then, the Republican Party has changed a lot since then, too\u2014a fact not lost on the uncommonly conscientious and almost intoxicatingly earnest Hillsdale community. \u201cThe Republican Party Hillsdale professors helped to found and that party today are radically distinct,\u201d said Micah Meadowcroft, an editor at the Washington Free Beacon, and a Hillsdale graduate who\u2019s maintained tight ties to his fellow alumni in D.C. But even though the party of Lincoln shares little in common with the party of Trump, Meadowcroft says, Hillsdale College embodies the best of both. \u201cThe motives of Hillsdale remain the same today as they were then, nothing less than the preservation and cultivation of a view of the human person that we have the audacity to call true.\u201d As a high schooler, Meadowcroft visited Hillsdale and loved it\u2014but worried that if he got into his \u201creach school,\u201d Princeton, he\u2019d lack the willpower turn down the Ivy League. \u201cI said, \u2018God, I think you want me to go to Hillsdale. You know what to do, God.\u2019\u201d His prayers were answered.\n\nStudents like Meadowcroft work to hold Hillsdale to its founding ideals, just as the public-facing college claims to do for the whole country. They also welcome scrutiny of the political views their school promotes. \u201cHillsdale is conservative, not right wing,\u201d explains one op-ed in the student paper, the Hillsdale Collegian, cited to me several times as an example of internal resistance to public displays of partisanship. Most Hillsdale graduates don\u2019t go into politics, and the majority, I\u2019m told, are culturally conservative but not party-line GOPers.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that politics don\u2019t come up. In the run-up to Pence\u2019s commencement speech, the ongoing battle for the soul of the Republican Party played out microcosmically among undergraduates\u2014in the same way college students elsewhere would debate the legitimacy of a politically incorrect mascot or adjustments to the on-campus meal plan.\n\nThe staff of the Hillsdale Collegian\u2014a robust and objective student paper whose alumni include multiple Wall Street Journal editorial writers, the Daily Beast\u2019s Betsy Woodruff, and award-winning investigative journalist Liz Essley Whyte among others\u2014describe a healthy tension between the academic priorities of student life and the political affiliations of the school\u2019s public face.\n\nWriters and one editor on staff at the Collegian told me about a recent incident concerning the vice president\u2019s speech. In addition to an article announcing that Pence would deliver that year\u2019s keynote, the Collegian had run a web-only process piece detailing the system of speaker selection, by which an elected board of upperclassmen polls their classmates and chooses, in concert with Arnn, three speakers to invite. The story revealed that the students\u2019 first two choices\u2014comedian Tim Allen and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, according to an early story draft\u2014had declined Hillsdale\u2019s invitation.\n\nBut that same day, the process piece disappeared.\n\nOne editor posted a message in the Hillsdale Collegian\u2019s Facebook group, \u201cWhere is the other commencement story?\u201d The editor-in-chief, a promising journalist with multiple internships under her belt, replied about an hour later: \u201cWe took it down from the website. Administration asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were told to take down the story because it would make whoever was chosen look bad, just by saying who was asked first and second,\u201d one Collegian staffer explained. But this student also explained that Allen and Rumsfeld were speakers \u201cthe student body could agree on, because they didn\u2019t have a controversial political affiliation. ... All of the sudden, we\u2019re going to hear from a vice president who not all of us agree has an understanding of the \u2018Good Life\u2019 and is associated with Trump, who definitely does not fit with anything that we\u2019re taught to value.\u201d\n\nFinding fault with the college\u2019s overt political ties isn\u2019t a new trend, said Joy Pullmann, a leading intellectual opponent to the Common Core State Standards and managing editor of The Federalist. She graduated in 2009 from Hillsdale, where she witnessed an almost identical debate over the choice of Mitt Romney for commencement speaker in 2007. \u201cI was personally really annoyed about that,\u201d she said, echoing the concerns of the senior class at the time. \u201cBecause it\u2019s like, Look, it\u2019s my commencement, I don\u2019t want to hear a politician come and tell me how I should vote for him.\u201d\n\nPullman might object when Washington, D.C. tries to funnel its politics into Hillsdale; but she doesn\u2019t mind when the pipeline works the other way around. Pullmann herself petitioned Trump, along with a cohort of anti-Common Core activists, to choose Arnn for education secretary. (And, per Arnn, Trump nearly did .) She founded a classical grade school in the Hillsdale mold alongside her husband, who attended Hillsdale\u2019s graduate school for statesmanship. He would come home from seminars at the Michigan campus reconvinced of the college\u2019s mission, she recalls: \u201cHe said to me, \u2018No, you don\u2019t understand, Dr. Arnn is trying to save the country.\u2019\u201d\n\nArnn\u2019s leadership is undeniable, Pullmann said with a gamely Midwestern laugh: \u201cAt the end of the day, if Dr. Arnn wants Mike Pence to be commencement speaker, so much for democracy.\u201d Spalding said roughly the same of Pence\u2019s invitation, that a letter from Arnn to the vice president pretty much did the trick: \u201cTo get a letter from Dr. Arnn on behalf of the board, to be invited to Hillsdale, for someone who's interested in these kinds of ideas and knows who we are? It\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\n\nAnd if Hillsdale\u2019s determined to save the country, don\u2019t be too quick to bet against them. \u201cWe\u2019re all data points that Hillsdale\u2019s project in D.C. is on a positive trajectory, but it\u2019s a long-range project,\u201d said Will Dunham, policy director for Kevin McCarthy and a recent graduate of the college who didn\u2019t conceive of a career in politics until taking a course in statesmanship with Arnn in his senior year. The takeaway, for Dunham: \u201cApplied politics, not grad school,\u201d was the right path. Influence won out over academics, and in D.C. anyway, \u201cHillsdale\u2019s journey is the same.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, as long as the school remains true to its ideals, its acolytes aren\u2019t sweating Trump too much. They\u2019re thinking in terms of decades, not years. \u201cWhether the American experiment continues to work is the gauge of whether [Hillsdale\u2019s mission] is working,\u201d said the staffer, who\u2019s been in D.C. for a decade. With the rest of D.C. counting down the days until November 6, 2018, the staffer says, \u201cHillsdale\u2019s long game stands out.\u201d", "description": "Hillsdale College might be cozying up to Trump, but its acolytes are playing the long game.", "authors": ["Ryan Lizza", "Alice Lloyd"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e3/2c/8523588e479cbb2fb2c3c94773d7/180511-hillsdale-college-gate.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-12"}
