Those can be injured coming out the front, up top or in the back. If it goes posteriorly or back it becomes a medical issue for us so that we worry that there's more problems. His came back posteriorly and he didn't have any medical issues but we still transported him to Baptist Medical Center [Jacksonville] and we turned his care over to Brett Frykberg who is an ortho-trauma physician.\"\n\nPer Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, Hill won't need surgery but \"will miss a couple of weeks.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old had two catches for 16 yards and one rush for five yards before exiting.\n\nHill has been one of the NFL's most productive wide receivers since the start of 2017. He had over 1,100 receiving yards in each of the previous two seasons and led the NFL with 27 receptions of at least 20 yards and finished fourth with 12 touchdowns in 2018.\n\nAs valuable as he is on the outside, the Chiefs are one of the few teams that can continue to play at a high level without their No. 1 receiver. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes had a historic 2018 season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns en route to being named NFL MVP.\n\nTight end Travis Kelce was Mahomes' favorite option last year with a team-high 150 targets and 103 receptions. Sammy Watkins had 40 receptions in his first season with the Chiefs despite missing six games as a result of injuries.\n\nUntil Hill is able to return, Watkins and Demarcus Robinson will be the top two wideouts for head coach Andy Reid. There is more than enough talent on this offense to keep them going strong as they chase a fourth consecutive AFC West title.", "description": "Kansas City Chiefs  wide receiver  Tyreek Hill  was taken to the hospital after suffering a shoulder injury in Week 1 against the  Jacksonville Jaguars ...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/821/352/hi-res-4fc09488903b0e55dea505af3d58e0a3_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
