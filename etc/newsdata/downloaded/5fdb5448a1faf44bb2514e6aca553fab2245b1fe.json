Complainants argued signs deliberately misled voters by replicating official AEC branding. The case against Mr Frydenberg was filed by his unsuccessful Independent challenger Oliver Yates who is seeking to force a by-election in Kooyong. The AEC argued it was impossible to know whether voters changed their ballot based on the signs.
