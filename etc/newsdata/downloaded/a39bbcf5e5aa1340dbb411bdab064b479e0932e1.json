Their busy schedule since their debut in 2011 led to a desire to carve out time to just ... breathe. After spending some time at home, the members soon found themselves building a studio and writing songs for their third album, \u201cFever Dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that we really came together after a very long time to work on new music, so there was this energy in that process of like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re back together, let\u2019s do something fun,\u2019\u201d Hilmarsd\u00f3ttir said.\n\nAfter a recent performance on \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\u201d Of Monsters and Men played New York City\u2019s Radio City Music Hall, where the group plowed through music from all three albums, keeping audience members on their feet nearly the entire show.\n\nPrior to the concert, we caught up with Hilmarsd\u00f3ttir on everything from \u201cFever Dream\u201d and fame to the band\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d cameo.\n\nIt\u2019s been four years since your last album release, and as I understand it, you\u2019ve been busy. What have the last few years been like?\n\nAfter we released \u201cBeneath the Skin,\u201d the second album, we toured the world for about a year, a year and a half, I think it was, and right after that, we took a minute to get back into life in Iceland, build our own studio. In the past we\u2019ve kind of had a hard time writing on the road, so you get back home and you try to get back into the rhythm of everything again. So, pretty much right away when we got back home, we started to write for this album.\n\nWould you say that having your own studio changed the game a little bit for you, and how so?\n\nIt changed a lot for us. When you have your own studio, you just have all the time in the world, or that\u2019s how you feel, at least. It\u2019s very easy to go in and play around, and I think you can hear the laugh in some of our songs, like the song called \u201cUnder a Dome,\u201d where it was with us for such a long time and it was one of those songs where if you get stuck, you would go back to that song and layer it and play around. When you have your own studio, you can play around a lot more.\n\nSo did you feel like there was a moment where you\u2019re like, \u201cOK, we\u2019re done.\u201d I mean, you could play around for years, but at what point were you happy with the end result?\n\nI was actually going crazy at one point because I just wanted to release this album, so there was plenty of time where we were like, \u201cOK, it\u2019s done.\u201d You can get lost a little bit because you have all this time, but we were also very eager, we wanted to finish it. We wanted to get out there and start touring again. So we were trying not to get too lost, you know.\n\nTom Cooper via Getty Images Of Monsters and Men will be on tour this fall.\n\nHow collaborative is the writing process for you? And it sounds like you also took a different approach to the way you were writing songs.\n\nDefinitely. My approach was this time I didn\u2019t rely on the guitar as much. I wanted to explore different things and I wanted to explore writing and recording, and just using different things to get curious \u2026 It was a really freeing process for me, honestly. Because you feel like a kid again a bit when you have something in your hands and you\u2019re trying to figure it out, and you\u2019re curious, and it does something to you.\n\nIn terms of the sound, how would you describe it, and how is it different from the past two studio records?\n\nThe sound, when we first make something, we usually don\u2019t talk a lot about what kind of an album we want to make. But we have a conversation where we wanted to feel open. Our previous album was very looking inward, and it was kind of cold, and it wasn\u2019t that it was trying to hold anyone at a distance, but it was a cold album. I can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s a very Icelandic winter, you know? This time, we wanted summer, we wanted to have a lot of fun on this album. It was a fun album to make, but it was also a very intense album to make. I think you definitely have those two sides coming together.\n\nAnd do you feel like, in some ways, whether it was growing or just taking a risk with this record, either sound-wise or lyric-wise, that you guys were trying to push yourself to the next level?\n\nYes, definitely. That\u2019s the thing that we think is very important for us, to try to push us a little bit. It\u2019s a different album for us, but it\u2019s funny, too. We, the past four years, were growing, and we were very conscious about never relying on our comfort songs. So if we felt comfortable, like, \u201cOh, yeah this would make sense for a huge brass part.\u201d How can we do it differently? It just makes the process really fun.\n\nYou mentioned you wanted to make a fun album, and I think you achieved that. How much of what you\u2019re writing has been influenced by the world around you, and specifically what?\n\nThis album is very much influenced from our lives for the past four years. So it\u2019s a very personal album. The lyrics touch on what we are going through, me and Ragnar [\u00de\u00f3rhallsson], the other singer and songwriter. So it\u2019s mostly just about coming back home from after a while, and you have your life and you have your life situation like everyone has.\n\nHow much of a whirlwind has it been for you? Because you came out of the gate with your debut and it got a lot of accolades and a lot of buzz.\n\nIt\u2019s strange. Sometimes, it\u2019s very strange. When we released our first album, we did not know what to expect, and everything was new and fresh and you were fully into it. But for a year and a half we toured, and coming from being a small band in Iceland, many of us actually hadn\u2019t traveled, we\u2019d never been to America, we\u2019d never traveled so much or seen so much, so our eyes were just very wide.\n\nAnd then you come back from that to Iceland and I have a bit of shock, a lot of shock. It was hard to come back into your life in Iceland, and there\u2019s a certain vision there that you have to get adjusted to. And when we were writing \u201cBeneath the Skin,\u201d I think we were all kind of dealing with that, of going from extreme speed to just quiet, but your mind is still just racing. So it was a big adjustment for us to do that. It can be a strange, strange life.\n\nA strange life that even landed you a small part in one episode of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d It\u2019s been a few years since that happened. What was that experience like for you?\n\nThat\u2019s the thing, you get to experience these kinds of things. It\u2019s incredible. We were such big fans of the show, so we stayed a few days in Spain and it was really fun, being fans, to see the production and see how much work is put into it and with all the costumes, like, everything is beautifully done. It\u2019s very cool to see behind the scenes and be a small part of it.\n\nAre there any other shows that you\u2019re watching right now? Do you guys binge-watch anything on the road, or do you not even have time to watch TV?\n\nI love TV. I haven\u2019t been watching anything. Well, I always watch \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d That\u2019s like a comfort. I watch it over and over \u2026 There\u2019s not a lot of time right now. It\u2019s just crazy times for me.\n\nWhat about music? What have you been listening to lately that you\u2019re excited about?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: A lot of the bands and musicians that I love just released albums. I love the new National album, I think it\u2019s such a beautiful album. And Bonnie Raitt, I like the new album a lot. I\u2019ve been obsessively listening to Tyler The Creator\u2019s \u201cIgor.\u201d I really liked that album a lot.\n\nSo now that you have three albums, what\u2019s it like creating a set list for the tour?\n\nIt is funny when you have three albums and we\u2019re running into the problem right now, which we never really had before, where we have too many songs that we want to play tonight. Which is a good problem. I mean, it\u2019s very cool. You can build the set up in a certain way, and you can take people on more of a journey, I think. It\u2019s been surprising, we\u2019ve just played a few shows, and I\u2019m always just so excited to play the new songs. I can\u2019t wait to play them, but I also, I really miss playing, especially the first album ... I don\u2019t want to go back a lot, but that album now for me, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m connecting to it again in a certain way, and I just love playing those songs live and seeing the reaction of the people. It just makes me feel really good.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "The Icelandic band rose to popularity in 2011.
