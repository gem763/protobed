But clinics receiving money also are expected to detect, treat and prevent sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, and Obria\u2019s prohibition against condoms means its prevention efforts \u2014 whether for single millennials or aging married couples \u2014 rest on abstinence.\n\nIn its application for federal funding, Obria pledged to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and recognized medical standards for preventing STDs. Used correctly and consistently, condoms are highly effective at preventing transmission of STDs, according to the CDC, a finding echoed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other major medical associations.\n\nBut Obria will not advocate or provide condoms. Instead, its staff will \u201cemphasize that avoiding sex is the only 100-percent method to prevent pregnancy and STDs\u201d and teach patients about \u201chigh-risk behaviors\u201d and the \u201crisks of using \u2018safe-sex\u2019 methods,\u201d according to the group\u2019s application.\n\nObria representatives declined a request to be interviewed for this article. But in a 2018 interview, Kathleen Bravo, CEO of the Obria Group, described the organization\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cBy reducing sexual risk, you would have less women getting sick with STDs and cancer and pregnancies,\u201d said Bravo, a devout Catholic. \u201cIn other words, teach them to not even go down that path.\u201d\n\nSexual health educators, tasked with reversing four straight years of record levels of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis across the nation, regard Obria\u2019s prohibition against condoms as reckless and dismiss its focus on abstinence as wishful thinking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom how a health care provider could test someone for an STI [sexually transmitted infection], have the results either be negative or positive and not provide them with information about the efficacy of condoms in STI protection,\u201d said Philip Yaeger, executive director of Radiant Health Centers, a community provider in Irvine that receives Title X funds.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, the number of gonorrhea cases across the country increased 67%; syphilis rose by 76%. The number of cases of gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia reached 2.3 million in 2017. About 30,000 people are newly infected with HIV each year.\n\nLeft untreated, sexually transmitted diseases can lead to infertility, cervical cancer, blindness and dementia. The number of cases of pregnant women who pass along syphilis to their babies more than doubled from 2013 to 2017 in the U.S., resulting in scores of newborn deaths and hundreds of children with severe health complications.\n\nIn Orange County, among the wide boulevards and gleaming office towers where Obria maintains its headquarters, sexually transmitted diseases are an unrelenting force: From 2013 to 2017, gonorrhea cases rose by 129%, chlamydia by 65% and syphilis by 99%.\n\nTo confront the epidemic, health educators from Radiant Health Centers set up tables with sound machines and pulsing lights in nightclub parking lots on most weekends. Over the past year, they\u2019ve handed out 25,000 condoms and oodles of lubricant.\n\nTiffany Hendrix, Radiant\u2019s director of Health Education and Prevention \u2014 who takes an unsentimental view of sexuality after becoming a teenage mother \u2014 travels from high school to high school with a model penis and vagina instructing students on how to properly use condoms.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what our beliefs are,\u201d Hendrix said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to educate a person so they can make informed decisions, like with diabetes or cholesterol.\u201d\n\nBut the conservative Christians helping fuel the growth in religion-based medical care in the U.S. say doctrinal beliefs rightfully determine the services offered in their hospitals and clinics, even when it involves virulent sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n\u201cContraception is seen as harming the gifts God gave us,\u201d said Theresa Notare, assistant director of the Natural Family Planning Program at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. \u201cYou can\u2019t put in physical barriers like condoms or chemical substances that are going to obstruct the natural design of the ovaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no exceptions,\u201d Notare said, even for STDs and HIV.\n\nIf a spouse is HIV infected, she said, withholding sex becomes a gesture of love. \u201cThe very difficult question has to be asked: Do we never have sex again? Quite frankly, because of a life-threatening disease, I would interpret it as yes.\u201d\n\nCatholic and evangelical Christian advocates herald President Donald Trump as an unlikely champion who, after decades of wobbly promises from Republican lawmakers and presidents, is delivering on their agenda.\n\nThe administration has worked methodically to appoint judges who oppose abortion rights; stamp out Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers; reverse Obama-era mandates on employers to include birth control in insurance coverage; and give primacy to abstinence sexual education in schools.\n\nIn loosening long-standing requirements that clinics provide the full suite of birth control options, including condoms, the Trump administration has allowed what were once makeshift anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers \u2014 which typically offered pregnancy tests and, at most, operated an ultrasound machine \u2014 to become certified medical clinics.\n\nOver the next three years, Obria could receive $5.1 million in federal family planning funds for its California clinics. But Bravo, who operates 38 clinics in six states, has grander visions: She wants Obria to become a nationwide alternative to Planned Parenthood, launching a $240 million capital campaign to open more sites.\n\n\u201cWe put huge amounts of money into marketing our medical clinics to make sure that women know that we\u2019re here in their city and these are the services that we provide,\u201d Bravo said.\n\nBut Obria\u2019s main website and the Obria Direct app for patients do not clearly indicate the organization\u2019s religious convictions or how its religious beliefs limit its medical offerings.\n\nThe organization\u2019s homepage portrays a prosaic medical practice \u201cdevoted to taking care of you holistically\u201d and providing \u201cthe support and answers you need in regards to your sexual health.\u201d The list of services includes STD testing and treatment, HIV testing, well-woman care and health education. Embedded in a lengthy description of the failure rates and possible complications of intrauterine devices, birth control pills, condoms and patches on Obria\u2019s \u201cBirth Control\u201d page are notes that \u201cObria Medical Clinics does not prescribe birth control\u201d and that natural family planning \u201cis ineffective at preventing STDs.\u201d\n\nMedical facilities are not required to inform patients of religious affiliations or the limits of health care options.\n\nThe number of Catholic-affiliated hospitals across the country has grown rapidly in recent years, especially as hospital systems have consolidated. Five of the top 10 hospital systems by net patient revenue are associated with the Roman Catholic Church. But more than a third of women who visit a Catholic hospital for reproductive care are unaware of the religious affiliation, according to researchers from the University of Chicago and the University of California-San Francisco.\n\nDavid Magnus, director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, said clinics such as Obria are essentially pulling a \u201cbait and switch\u201d and raised the specter of potential liability for religiously oriented clinics, funded with public dollars, should a patient be given incomplete advice and then contract an STD.\n\n\u201cPretending that you\u2019ve given adequate advice is misleading and lying,\u201d he said.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
