Electric vehicles and renewable energy are gaining traction as governments adopt tougher regulations on greenhouse-gas emissions to address a warming planet.\n\nThe oil-and-gas sector now makes up just 4% of the S&P 500 index, down from 10% a decade ago, FactSet data show. Exxon recently fell out of the S&P 500\u2019s top 10 companies for the first time in years.\n\nWorld leaders will convene at the U.N. on Monday to chart their paths to meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris accord, which seeks to limit global temperature increases to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius. But much of the action is expected to happen on the sidelines and at events hosted throughout the week by industry and investor groups, where oil-and-gas companies\u2014more engaged on climate issues than in the past\u2014will make the case that they remain sound investments.\n\n\u201cOne of the top risks today is climate change,\u201d said Michael Rubio, Chevron\u2019s general manager over environmental, social and governance issues. \u201cEngagements have increased, and investors are expecting us to voluntarily disclose how we\u2019re managing the climate-related risks and opportunities.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe world\u2019s largest oil-and-gas producers are in general agreement on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from their drilling sites, pipelines and other operations. The companies have set targets to curb releases of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, for example. They have also discussed new initiatives tied to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reducing emissions from industries such as shipping, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBut there is friction among some of the companies over whether to commit to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from the oil byproducts they sell, such as gasoline. These releases constitute roughly 88% of major oil-and-gas companies\u2019 greenhouse-gas footprint, according to estimates from Redburn, a London-based research firm.\n\nShell was among the first of the major oil companies to agree to cut those emissions, a decision that initially angered some members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, an industry consortium. The dispute grew heated in meetings among the companies last year, according to people familiar with the matter. Companies including Total SA and Repsol SA also have set targets to reduce the carbon intensity of their products.\n\nEngineers prepare to fly a drone outfitted for emissions detection at a Shell site in the Permian Basin.

Exxon, Chevron and BP are among those whose executives are concerned about setting such emission goals, the people said.\n\nBeyond that, some executives believe it is impossible for an oil-and-gas company that is seeking to increase production to live up to any agreement to cut those sources of greenhouse gases, known among the companies as scope 3 emissions.\n\n\u201cThe most effective way to get at scope 3 emissions is through the role of government,\u201d Mr. Rubio of Chevron said, referring to measures to reduce greenhouse-gas discharges by putting a price on them.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has pushed for similar steps. \u201cIf we want to have the markets reflecting the reality, we need to have a price on carbon,\u201d he told reporters Friday.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance concerns, long the province of a small cohort of impact investors, have gained more mainstream momentum in recent years. Asset managers that once evaluated environmental or sustainability issues separately from typical financial analysis are now incorporating those factors into their assessments of energy companies\u2019 future prospects, said Jonathan Waghorn, a portfolio manager for Guinness Asset Management Ltd.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think oil companies can be partners to act on climate change? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cI really think it\u2019s just shifted in the last year,\u201d said Dirk Cockrum, a vice president overseeing sustainability efforts at Houston-based pipeline company Kinder Morgan Inc. Nearly all of Kinder Morgan\u2019s largest shareholders ask about the company\u2019s performance in environmental, social and governance areas, or what is known as ESG, he said, and the company faces a deluge of requests from firms that generate sustainability scorecards.\n\n\u201cThe amount of investors who are looking closely at these issues is growing and is becoming significant,\u201d said Osmar Abib, chairman of global energy at Credit Suisse Group AG . \u201cIt\u2019s something oil-and-gas companies need to take seriously, and they are.\u201d\n\nClimate activism is also bringing change to the banking industry. Some banks, such as Toronto-Dominion Bank, have faced a backlash for helping finance energy projects such as the Dakota Access Pipeline. Some bank executives are in discussions with oil-industry officials to create new standards requiring energy borrowers to detail climate risks in loans, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cThe societal pressures are only going to increase,\u201d Susan Dio, BP\u2019s top U.S. executive, said at a natural-gas conference last week.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Elliott at rebecca.elliott@wsj.com and Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com", "description": "As global leaders prepare to debate action on climate change at the United Nations, big oil companies are aiming to show that they are part of the solution to a problem they helped cause.", "authors": ["Rebecca Elliott", "Bradley Olson", "Rebecca.Elliott Wsj.Com", "Bradley.Olson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109426/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
