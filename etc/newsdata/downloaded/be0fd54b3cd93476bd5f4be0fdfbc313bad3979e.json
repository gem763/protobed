Impacted customers will be informed by post or via online banking.\n\nCNET: Senators want to know if TikTok poses a national security risk\n\n\"Since 2016, the Group has invested an additional 2.4 billion euros in upgrading and strengthening its IT systems and cybersecurity,\" UniCredit says. \"Customer data safety and security is UniCredit's top priority and in June 2019, the Group implemented a new strong identification process for access to its web and mobile services, as well as payment transactions.\"\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time UniCredit has faced a data breach incident. In July 2017, the bank said it had become a victim of data theft due to a third-party provider accessing Italian customer data without consent or authorization.\n\nTwo separate breaches occurred; one between September and October 2016, and another between June and July 2017. Information belonging to approximately 400,000 Italian customers was impacted, including PII and IBAN numbers.\n\nTechRepublic: Cybersecurity Awareness Month: How individuals and businesses can stay vigilant\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
