Unsworth said in a TV interview at the time that it wouldn't help, which led to Musk's multiple online rants.\n\nWhat Unsworth now reveals, through deposition transcripts and emails that his lawyers obtained, is that Musk and his affiliates paid private investigators, including one who tuned out to be a convicted felon, to try and dig up dirt on the cave rescuer. Additionally, Musk directed his team to pressure foreign officials in Thailand to say nice things about him and his mini-sub, even as they were grappling with what would prove to be a deadly rescue mission.\n\nLast month, Musk asked the court to decide that Unsworth had no viable reason for the defamation case, in part, because he claims he was using slang and didn't really mean Unsworth was a pedophile. Unsworth's legal team, led by L. Lin Wood, says the case should proceed because, among other reasons, Musk made several contradictory and false statements to defend himself under oath.\n\n\"Musk's motion is based principally on the antithetical bases that, on the one hand, he was not calling Unsworth a pedophile, while on the other hand, he did not harbor serious doubts as to whether Unsworth was actually a pedophile,\" Unsworth's attorneys wrote in the filing. \"Musk's accusations are false, defamatory, and were published negligently and with actual malice. His motion for summary judgment must be denied.\"\n\nMusk's attorney, Alex Spiro, said in a statement e-mailed by a PR firm to CNBC: \"This case is nothing but a money-grab in which Unsworth has hired an agent and pursued profit, publicity and self-promotion at every turn. The truth of his motivations and actions will come out soon enough.\"\n\nWood replied, on Twitter, \"Musk lawyer's comments are simply more accusations of a dishonest Elon Musk defense & PR campaign to demean & falsely attack my client. Since the rescue, Mr. Unsworth has received a total of \u00a32,400 for his assistance in connection with two documentaries about Thai Cave Rescue.\"\n\nAs Musk struggles to stabilize his electric vehicle maker's precarious financial position, the lawsuit is yet another distraction for the CEO and Tesla shareholders. Tesla's stock is down 28% this year, as the company suffers from ongoing legal and logistical challenges, and attempts to sell cars in more markets than ever before.\n\nThe Unsworth case looks particularly bad for Musk, whose image has taken a beating amid conflicts with employees, investors and regulators in the past two years. It also shows a shocking lapse in judgment.", "description": "According to new court filings, Musk was focused on what Thai officials were saying about him while they were trying to rescue a trapped soccer team and its coach.", "authors": ["Lora Kolodny"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105780169-1551965661188rtx6p9un.jpg?v=1551965727", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
