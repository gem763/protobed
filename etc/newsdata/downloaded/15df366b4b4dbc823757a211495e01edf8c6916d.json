Yes, we made a mistake (which we fixed in less than 30 seconds). And now we are admitting it. You all should try it sometime.\u201d\n\nThe retort represented a veiled jab at the president\u2019s ongoing refusal to acknowledge he erred in predicting Dorian would hammer Alabama as it approached the United States. Trump was roundly mocked on social media after displaying from the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon an apparently Sharpie-altered early forecast showing the state within the storm\u2019s path.\n\nThe doctored map backed up Trump\u2019s assessment in a Sunday tweet that Alabama and a handful of southeastern states \"will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\" \u2014 even though the National Hurricane Center had already projected that Dorian's track would veer far from Alabama.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News!\u201d\n\nEric Trump, the president\u2019s son, also joined in on the attacks, citing the \u201cpettiness\u201d of a Washington Post story on the episode as \u201cexactly why the public hates the media.\u201d\n\nGrisham's exchange with CNN on Thursday also offered some of the president's other allies an opportunity to savage the network \u2014 a frequent target of Trump's ire \u2014 as the White House faces continued fallout over the Alabama controversy.\n\n\u201cHA! But honestly, what's the difference? We're all just \u2018irredeemable deplorables\u2019 to the likes of @CNN,\u201d tweeted Hogan Gidley, the White House\u2019s principal deputy press secretary, referring to the network\u2019s confusion of Alabama and Mississippi.\n\n\u201cHave you guys corrected your nearly two years of coverage on the collusion hoax yet? We\u2019re waiting on that too,\u201d chimed in conservative commentator and Fox News contributor Dan Bongino.\n\nAnd @TeamTrump, the official Twitter account for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, posted simply: \u201cROASTED @CNN!\u201d", "description": "Stephanie Grisham, President Donald Trump's top spokeswoman, delivered the first blow, chastising the network for an on-air graphic.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/21/e1/654f02a34c07aadb5914b80ecfad/1995-stephanie-grisham-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
