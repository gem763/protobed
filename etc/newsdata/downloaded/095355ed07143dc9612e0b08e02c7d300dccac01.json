But they held to their faith in the hopes of eternal life. Modern American evangelicals don't see the point of being Christian unless it comes with economic, political and social privilege. While the ancients had to fear dying in the arenas of the Roman Empire, today the fear is having to bake a cake for gay wedding. They are not interested in some abstract afterlife. What they want is prosperity and prestige in THIS life. But when your goals are that material and worldly, it is inevitable that you will seek to install a government that will cater to your, ultimately secular, personal desires. Religion simply becomes an identity, a way of asserting that you belong to the \"rightful\" cultural elite. Evangelicals trip over themselves to rationalize and explain that Trump, an unapologetic atheist for most of his life, is now suddenly a \"baby Christian\" (in his 70's) and that his lifetime of sins can be forgiven now that he is in a position to offer evangelicals what they want. Even better, by repainting him as a \"Christian\", they can now adopt many of his behaviors themselves while still calling themselves \"Christian\" even as they denounce other Christians who do not share their views as \"false\".", "description": "Call Travis Scott Mr. October.
