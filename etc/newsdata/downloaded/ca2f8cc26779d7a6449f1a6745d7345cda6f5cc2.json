The bill\u2019s sponsor, Animal Hope in Legislation, led the recent Los Angeles Fur Ban. The bill is also sponsored by The Animal Hope and Wellness Foundation and The Humane Society. California would be the first state in the nation to have such a measure in place.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is one of the most progressive states in the country and a world leader in animal welfare,\u201d said Assembly Member Friedman. \u201cGiven the overwhelming evidence of inhumane practices in the fur industry and the availability of so many different options for warm and fashionable fabrics, we will not continue to be complicit in unnecessary cruelty towards animals solely for the sake of fur.\u201d\n\nSeveral cities across California already have similar bans in place. West Hollywood, Berkeley, and San Francisco have outlawed the sale of fur in their cities. Earlier this year, Los Angeles unanimously passed a motion in favor of a similar measure.\n\nMore than a dozen European countries have full or partial bans on fur farming. Many major fashion houses have decided to part with animal fur, including Gucci, Versace, Coach, and Burberry. Technology in fashion is ever evolving and becoming more green, more efficient, and more innovative. Fur, however, requires the inherently cruel confining or trapping of animals solely for their fur, which must then be preserved with toxic chemicals.\n\nAB 44 would make it unlawful to manufacture, sell, offer for sale, display for sale, trade, give, donate or otherwise distribute a fur product in the state. The bill exempts certain items, including used fur. The prohibition would apply to items such as clothing, handbags, shoes, slippers, hats, or key chains that contain fur and provides for a civil penalty for each violation.\n\nThe fur industry\u2019s main farmed species are wild animals who are kept in small wire cages and are then subjected to cruel killing methods that are not regulated by the humane slaughter laws.\n\n\u201cGoing undercover into fur farms, I have seen the suffering and inhumane treatment of these animals firsthand,\u201d said Marc Ching, Founder of The Animal Hope and Wellness Foundation and Animal Hope in Legislation. \u201cAs a culture, a people, and a community grounded in compassion, California is ready to go fur-free. Products that encompass such suffering have no place here.\u201d", "description": "Today Assembly Member Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) introduced the California State Fur Ban, AB 44, to prohibit the sale and manufacture of new fur prod", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.businesswire.com/images/bwlogo_square.png", "published_at": "2018-12-04"}
