The brand will now be a part of investment firm Go Global Retail, though it will continue to operate independently.\n\n\u201cWe expect they will continue in the same direction as before,\u201d Christian Feuer, managing director of Go Global Retail, told The Verge. \u201cI don\u2019t think the customer will see a change. If they do, I hope they\u2019ll be happy with what they see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the customer will see a change.

It was known for casting real people as models and being one of the first clothing brands to take the No-Photoshop pledge.\n\nWhen the company sold to Walmart in March 2017, many customers reportedly felt betrayed. \u201cThe thing I loved about ModCloth is that I knew the clothes I bought there couldn\u2019t be found at Macy\u2019s and weren\u2019t worn by the masses,\u201d Connie Warner told The Los Angeles Times. Warner started a Boycott ModCloth Facebook page to protest the store\u2019s new owners. \u201cNo more. I\u2019ve unsubscribed from their emails. I refuse to shop at a store owned by Walmart.\u201d\n\nFor Walmart, the deal was part of a larger strategy to ramp up its e-commerce business in an effort to compete with Amazon. \u201cWhen we acquired ModCloth, our primary focus was to build assortment through proprietary, digitally-native brands,\u201d a Walmart spokesperson told The Verge. \u201cOur approach has evolved and our current focus is on building direct to consumer brands that we can leverage in an omni way. Similar to online grocery, we are putting our investments in areas where our omni capabilities and unique advantages put us in a position to win.\u201d\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t follow the \u201comni\u201d jargon, Walmart is trying to focus on products that play well on stores and online. And that makes sense \u2014 Walmart has sunk billions trying to compete with Amazon. While some of that money has paid off \u2014 online sales went up 40 percent last year in the US \u2014 the e-commerce division is projecting losses of more than $1 billion this year.\n\nWalmart has sunk billions into online retail\n\nHours after the ModCloth deal was announced, The Wall Street Journal reported Walmart was also looking to sell its personal shopping brand Jetblack. The boutique service lets customers shop via text message and have their items delivered within hours \u2014 but it was losing lots of money. \u201cAs of early this summer, Jetblack was losing around $15,000 per member annually,\u201d The Wall Street Journal wrote.\n\nFor ModCloth loyalists who jumped ship in 2017, it might finally be time to come back. While Feuer plans to grow the brand in the US and abroad, he wants it to stay true to its roots. \u201cWe\u2019re all focused on ModCloth being a specialty retailer with a specific orientation towards women\u2019s fashion,\u201d he said.", "description": "The women\u2019s e-commerce brand ModCloth will now be owned by Go Global Retail, after Walmart decided to sell it off just two years after first buying it.
