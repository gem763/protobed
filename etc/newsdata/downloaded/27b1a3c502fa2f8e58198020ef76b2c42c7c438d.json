I am so incredibly amazed at the outpouring of love and support... Posted by Laura Snyder on Wednesday, September 4, 2019\n\nA fourth-grader who was bullied because of his handmade University of Tennessee T-shirt was just given a four-year scholarship to the college, the university said Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe announcement comes about a week after the university found out that the boy was mocked by classmates after he pinned a homemade drawing of the UT logo to his T-shirt. The university first sent him a box of UT swag, then decided that his drawing was worthy of an official T-shirt \u2014 so it made one.\n\n[A kid was teased for his homemade University of Tennessee logo. Then UT made his drawing into a real shirt.]\n\nMore than 50,000 orange shirts with the boy\u2019s design have been presold by the university\u2019s official store, VolShop. All proceeds from the sale of the shirts, which sell for $14.99, will go to the nonprofit Stomp Out Bullying, the university said.\n\nThe boy, who lives in Florida, would be part of the class of 2032.\n\nThe scholarship will cover his tuition and fees beginning in fall 2028 \u201cshould he decide to attend UT and meet admission requirements,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nVol Nation, you united around a #FutureVol who created his own UT shirt. And now we are thrilled to offer him a spot in the Class of 2032 and a four-year scholarship.\ud83c\udf4a\ud83c\udf93 https://t.co/TjviKrMtLF \u2014 UT Knoxville (@UTKnoxville) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cUniversity officials have spoken several times with the boy\u2019s mother, who has expressed gratitude to the university and said the family has been deeply touched by the overwhelming outpouring from people around the world,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt all began last week, when it was \u201ccollege colors\u201d day at an elementary school in Altamonte Springs, Fla., and fourth-grade teacher Laura Snyder wrote on Facebook that one of her students wore an orange T-shirt representing his favorite school, the University of Tennessee.\n\n\u201cHe was SO EXCITED to show me his shirt. I was impressed that he took it one step further to make his own label,\u201d Snyder wrote on Facebook.\n\nBut after lunch, the student came back to her room, put his head on his desk and began crying.\n\n\u201cSome girls at the lunch table next to his (who didn\u2019t even participate in college colors day) had made fun of his sign that he had attached to his shirt,\u201d Snyder wrote. \u201cHe was DEVASTATED.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to cheer him up, Snyder wrote that she planned to buy him a University of Tennessee shirt. That\u2019s when things took off.\n\nHer post went viral on Facebook, eventually reaching University of Tennessee fans and then the university itself. The university sent the student a package of UT swag for him and his classmates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure I can put into words his reaction,\u201d Snyder wrote in an update to her post. \u201cIt was so heartwarming.\u201d\n\nThat was when the university\u2019s official shop decided to take the student\u2019s logo and turn it into an actual shirt.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him that his design was being made into a real shirt and people wanted to wear it, his jaw dropped,\u201d Snyder wrote.\n\nThe student\u2019s mother wrote a letter of gratitude that Snyder posted. It said, in part, \u201cI can tell you that I spent a lot of my day reading all the kind words in support of my son and I\u2019m touched beyond words,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThis is a letter from my student\u2019s mom Posted by Laura Snyder on Friday, September 6, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nTrapped at a waterfall, this man sent out an SOS message in a bottle.
