I was impressed that he took it one step further to make his own label,\u201d Snyder wrote on Facebook.\n\nBut after lunch, the student came back to her room, put his head on his desk and began crying.\n\n\u201cSome girls at the lunch table next to his (who didn\u2019t even participate in college colors day) had made fun of his sign that he had attached to his shirt,\u201d Snyder wrote. \u201cHe was DEVASTATED.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn an effort to cheer him up, Snyder wrote that she planned to buy him a University of Tennessee shirt. That\u2019s when things took off.\n\nHer post went viral on Facebook, eventually reaching University of Tennessee fans and then the university itself. The university sent the student a package of UT swag for him and his classmates.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure I can put into words his reaction,\u201d Snyder wrote in an update to her post. \u201cIt was so heartwarming.\u201d\n\nThat was when the university\u2019s official shop decided to take the student\u2019s logo and turn it into an actual shirt.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him that his design was being made into a real shirt and people wanted to wear it, his jaw dropped,\u201d Snyder wrote.\n\nThe student\u2019s mother wrote a letter of gratitude that Snyder posted. It said, in part, \u201cI can tell you that I spent a lot of my day reading all the kind words in support of my son and I\u2019m touched beyond words,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThis is a letter from my student\u2019s mom Posted by Laura Snyder on Friday, September 6, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nTrapped at a waterfall, this man sent out an SOS message in a bottle.
