He suggested these owners could \u201cspend more time\u201d seeking out issues before they purchased a home.\n\nHe said owners \u201cshould go and spend a little bit more time having a look (at their apartment) before they settle\u201d. Mr Chandler said \u201c60 to 70\u201d per cent of developers were producing a high quality product.\n\nHe suggested people buying off the plan could \u201cdo a little bit of research to work out who might be risky and who\u2019s less risky\u201d to increase confidence in the market.\n\nMr Chandler made the comments last night during a state parliament estimates hearing.\n\n\n\nA petition started by one of the residents of Mascot Towers, Andrew Burrell calling for a \u201cRoyal Commission into the Building Industry\u201d has now gathered more than 27,000 signatures.\n\nMr Burrell\u2019s petition has called for the \u201coverhaul the way buildings we call our homes are designed, approved, built, certified for occupation, insured, financed, and managed\u201d, saying recent issues coming to light were the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d.\n\nNews.com.au contacted the Mr Chandler regarding the comments but did not receive a response.", "description": "The NSW Building Commissioner has warned property owners to adopt a \u201cbuyer beware\u201d approach to inspecting and purchasing homes, after advising that three more apartment towers have \u201cserious issues\u201d.", "authors": ["Phoebe Loomes"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3e3b17a43a031c0fd4e77f708cb2d666?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
