Kamala D. Harris and Cory A. Booker also have embraced the idea of a mandatory buyback and ban of certain kinds of military-style, semiautomatic firearms.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve just laid their cards on the table for the world to see,\u201d Mr. Arulanandam said.\n\nPhilip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, said the comments were \u201cabsolutely\u201d helpful to gun rights advocates wary of growing talk on Capitol Hill of instituting new controls as a response to the recent shootings.\n\n\u201cHopefully, he woke some people up, because in the past when we said look, you know, this is a slippery slope towards gun confiscation the other side would laugh, no, no, no \u2014 we don\u2019t want to take your guns. No, no, no,\u201d Mr. Van Cleave said. \u201cAnd this confirms what we knew all along \u2014 yeah, you do.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call for gun confiscations is exactly what Democrats dream of in secret but will rarely admit publicly, said Erich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America.\n\n\u201cAnd his gun confiscation plans can only be accomplished if Congress passes a Universal Background Check law which requires the effective registration of every gun buyer in America,\u201d Mr. Pratt said. \u201cThese policies are a recipe for electoral disaster, as no presidential candidate has ever won the White House while actively campaigning for gun control.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump also weighed in, saying Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments made it harder to strike a deal on the issue.\n\n\u201cDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal. Convinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away. Will continue forward!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nEven pro-gun control Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, have pushed back on Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments and said they\u2019re not helping the already sensitive discussions between the White House and Capitol Hill on potential new gun controls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O\u2019Rourke, but it\u2019s no excuse not to go forward,\u201d Mr. Schumer told New York reporters on a conference call.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Mr. O\u2019Rourke has not shied away from his aggressive call and even said he\u2019d be open to expanding his proposal to cover more kinds of guns.\n\n\u201cAsk Chuck Schumer what he\u2019s been able to get done,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke recently told reporters in Colorado. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have background checks. Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued have given us absolutely nothing and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke pointed to a recent poll that said 49% of people in his home state said they support a mandatory buyback program of \u201cassault\u201d weapons for payment, compared to about 29% who said they were opposed.\n\n\u201cWhat he may not know, but what I hear loud and clear because I\u2019m traveling the country listening to my fellow Americans, is that the people are there,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s words will likely serve to fire up bases on both sides of the issue, said Brandon Combs, president of the Firearms Policy Coalition.\n\n\u201cAmerican gun owners are not going to let this go,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to carve it in granite, hang it around their necks like an albatross, and make them all live with it for decades.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
