In a similar vein to when Rashford burst onto the scene, Greenwood plays without fear and seemingly unwavering confidence in his own abilities.\n\nThere are, of course, differences between the two young strikers. Greenwood at times exudes shades of Wayne Rooney in his play \u2013 often he takes up deeper positions than a traditional No.9 would and is a good passer of the ball.\n\nDue to being left-footed and relentless in front of goal, comparisons have been made with former United hitman Robin van Persie. Like the Dutchman, Greenwood is also incredibly adept with his right foot and has even been known to take set-pieces with both feet.\n\nDue to his pace and two-footedness, Greenwood is capable of playing wide on the left and right, as well as up front. This is reminiscent of Ousmane Dembele, although where Dembele has an unbelievable box of tricks from wide areas, Greenwood perhaps reads the game slightly better than the Barcelona man.\n\nWhat experience does he have?\n\nAt 17, Greenwood is somewhat lacking in first-team experience, although he did make his first start for United in the final match of the 2018/19 season in the 2-0 defeat to Cardiff, becoming the club\u2019s youngest ever Premier League starter. He had previously made two substitute appearances against West Ham and Arsenal.\n\nIt is Greenwood\u2019s record at youth level that has propelled him into the United first team \u2013 as a 15-year-old he top-scored with 16 goals in 17 games for the U18 side. Last season he continued in the same vein, with 15 goals in 13 games in the U18 Premier League, as well as three in six in the Premier League 2 and five in as many games in the UEFA Youth League. Including his senior appearances, he averaged a goal every 92 minutes throughout the 2018/19 season.\n\nGreenwood\u2019s remarkable form was rewarded with a place in United\u2019s pre-season squad, where he scored against Leeds and Inter Milan and impressed sufficiently to remain with the team past the transfer window.\n\nThis season, he had featured from the bench in all of United\u2019s league games prior to the international break before remaining on the bench in the 1-0 win over Leicester. All things point to Greenwood making his first start of the season against Astana this Thursday.\n\nInternationally, he has featured for England at various youth levels and made his debut at U21 level in the most recent international break, featuring twice for Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s side.\n\nWhen might he feature?\n\nWith United being handed a relatively kind Europa League group with Astana, Partizan Belgrade and AZ Alkmaar, it seems likely that Greenwood will be handed starts in the group stage of the competition and potentially beyond.\n\nUnited also play Rochdale in the EFL Cup on September 25, and due to the nature of the competition and opposition it is likely that Greenwood will start here too.\n\nThere were more than a few United fans calling for Greenwood to make his first start of the season against Leicester, given injuries to Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba and United\u2019s lack of depth in attacking areas, but he was consigned to the bench.\n\nShould United befall any further injuries to the likes of Rashford, Martial or James, it is not unlikely that Greenwood will feature more prominently in the Premier League as the season progresses, especially if he impresses in the cup competitions.\n\nWhat\u2019s been said about him?\n\nUnited manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was full of praise for Greenwood and described the young striker as \u201cone of the best finishers I\u2019ve seen\u201d.\n\nGreenwood\u2019s former academy coach Mark Senior was also very complimentary of the young striker, and praised his unique skill-set.\n\n\u201cPeople says he\u2019s like the new Robin van Persie but I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said in March 2019. \u201cI think he\u2019s his own man. I\u2019ve not seen another player like him. His style means his pace is deceptive because he is absolutely rapid.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Old Trafford legend Ryan Giggs was one of those who paid Greenwood the complement of comparing him to van Persie.\n\n\u201cI think you can get excited about his talent,\u201d Giggs said. \u201cYou never know when players step up to the first team how long it will take them to get used to being at a big club.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talented. I\u2019ve seen a lot of him. Both feet. He actually looks and moves like Robin van Persie. He\u2019s a talent.\u201d\n\nAidan Barlow, Greenwood\u2019s teammate in the United youth ranks, admitted it is \u201cno surprise\u201d that he has been fast-tracked into the first team.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a top player and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll become one as well,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep working hard and he\u2019s humble. He will keep his head down, and I am happy for him.\u201d", "description": "Ahead of Manchester United\u2019s UEFA Europa League opener against Astana on Thursday, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has stated that he will rotate his squad with several first-team regulars set to be rested.
