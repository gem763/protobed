The submission proposed it do so \"routinely\".\n\nIn its most recent inspection report, the percentage of findings where ASIC felt insufficient work had been done varied markedly for the big four. Deloitte had the highest rate at 32 per cent, compared with EY (22 per cent), KPMG (21 per cent) and PwC (12 per cent).\n\n'Full and accurate' communication\n\nThe regulator said the proposed change to inform companies of audit inspection results was intended to ensure companies had a full and honest picture of the quality of their auditors' work.\n\n\"While we inform directors and audit committees that we are reviewing an audit to enable directors to ask questions of the auditor about any ASIC findings and how they were addressed, direct communication of the findings will ensure that the findings are fully and accurately communicated,\" the ASIC submission said.\n\nAn ASIC regulatory guidance says this information may help directors engage with firms about steps the auditors would take to improve audit quality.\n\nA KPMG spokeswoman said the proposal was \"largely consistent with our own approach\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our practice is to notify our client that their file will be inspected, to communicate with them throughout the process, and to share the findings,\" she said.\n\nThe feedback process also could include sharing the inspection report itself, and KPMG provided the original ASIC inspection report to clients when requested, she said.\n\nA PwC spokeswoman said the firm had a process to keep clients informed of developments with audit reviews.\n\n\"We are transparent with our clients where our audits of their financial statements are subject to ASIC inspections,\" she said.\n\nAsked whether this meant sharing the ASIC report with the client, the spokeswoman said the firm shared \"relevant findings\".\n\nEY said it took a similar approach to PwC.\n\n\"Whenever ASIC selects an audit file for inspection, we inform the client and discuss the findings with the audit committee,\" an EY spokeswoman said.\n\nASIC informs companies it is investigating an audit of their financial reports five days after it alerts the audit firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeloitte's managing partner of audit and assurance, Jamie Gatt, previously has told The Australian Financial Review that the regulator's approach to measuring audit quality \"can and has resulted in significant volatility in results\" and is \"not fit for purpose\".\n\n\n\n", "description": "The corporate regulator wants to tell companies directly when it identifies problems with the auditing of their financial reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3582%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_92/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/409f733d474cdf1e6f2bed6154a759748f0a47e7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
