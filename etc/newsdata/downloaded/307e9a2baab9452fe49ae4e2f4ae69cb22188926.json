Moreover, as IFS economist Xiaowei Xu points out, the UK population is ageing, meaning that taxes will probably have to rise rather than fall over the next decade.\n\nTherefore, tax cuts would make sense only if they reduced inequality in some way, promoted economic growth or made the tax system more efficient, the IFS suggests.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to see how the prime minister\u2019s plans to raise the higher rate threshold in income tax from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 and to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance contributions \u2013 by an as-yet unspecified amount \u2013 meet those criteria,\u201d it says.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The costly measure would not do much to improve the incentive to work either.\n\nMeanwhile, if the aim is to help the lowest earners, there is a much more effective and vastly cheaper way to do that than the change to National Insurance contributions, the institute says. It suggests instead increasing so-called work allowances under Universal Credit.\n\nFor example, spending \u00a33bn for that purpose could raise the incomes of the poorest fifth of households by 1.5 per cent. In contrast, spending as much on the National Insurance reform would result in a lift of only 0.1 per cent, the IFS has found.\n\nA work allowance is the amount eligible workers can earn before their Universal Credit payments are reduced. Only claimants with children or a disabled family member qualify.\n\nThe monthly work allowances are currently set at \u00a3287 if the claimant\u2019s Universal Credit includes housing support and \u00a3503 otherwise.", "description": "The tax cuts promised by Boris Johnson, which would cost billions and benefit mostly higher earners, are hard to justify, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has suggested, proposing a different way to help people on low incomes.
