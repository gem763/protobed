More than 30 metro stations were closed.\n\nIn the morning, officers dispersed small crowds of yellow vest activists who tried to gather in restricted areas in central Paris. Most of the demonstrators, some of whom later joined the climate protest, reportedly did not wear their usual fluorescent jackets to avoid being noticed.\n\nLater, masked anarchists in black clothing joined the climate march and became embroiled in sporadic skirmishes with police. They broke windows at a bank and several shops, and set fire to a makeshift barricade.\n\nOfficers in full anti-riot gear fired tear gas on the group, prompting some families who had been taking part in the environmental rally to flee.\n\nPolice said at least 163 people had been arrested as of Saturday afternoon, and nearly 400 received \u20ac135 (\u00a3120) fines for demonstrating in a banned area.\n\nThe violence tarnished an otherwise peaceful march that brought thousands of people, onto the streets a day after marches in Paris and other cities worldwide to demand government action to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nDemonstrators carried slogans like \"End oil now\" and \"End of the world\" while some held effigies, including one of president Emmanuel Macron wearing a crown marked \"King of bla-bla\".\n\nThe yellow vests, named after motorists' high-visibility jackets, were holding a 45th consecutive Saturday of action. Their movement emerged late last year, triggered by fuel tax rises and swelling into a revolt against Mr Macron's government.\n\nSome of their protests have been marked by rioting, partly blamed on the black bloc, but the police have also been accused of reacting with excessive force.\n\nA separate march was called by the FO trade union on Saturday to contest the government's planned pensions reforms. The proposed changes prompted a strike by metro workers on 13 Sept, shutting most of the underground network.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nThe democratic experiment that could solve France\u2019s yellow vest crisis", "description": "French police fired tear gas and made more than 160 arrests as anarchists hijacked a climate march on a day of protests in Paris.Anti-government \u201cyellow vest\u201d demonstrators took to the streets in an attempt to revive their movement, while \u201cblack bloc\u201d anarchists smashed shop windows and set fire to bins", "authors": ["Chris Baynes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7G_NB8NIVRyCDnCiHhZbdw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/c4a31b4258a2acd309761bac2c31c71e", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
