One posted: \"Have you ever come across a more biased commentary duo than Martin Tyler & Gary Neville,\" while another added: \"Gary Neville shouldn't be commentating on a Liverpool game.\"\n\nOne Twitter user said: \"Gary Neville usually such a good commentator just can't hide his bias when Liverpool are playing\" and another added: \"Neville's mind works like a guy who thinks about every combination possible AGAINST Liverpool.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nReds supporters will probably not be too upset following the final whistle, however, as their win ensured their unbeaten run at the start of the Premier League continued, and left them six points at the top of the table ahead of nearest challengers Manchester City .\n\nTheir next Premier League game is away at Aston Villa before they host City in a huge game which could go some way to deciding the title on November 10.", "description": "The Reds extended their lead at the top of the table to six points following their 2-1 win over Tottenham thanks to the Egyptian's penalty", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737949.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
