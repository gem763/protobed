According to the outlet, Abraham first released a sex tape in 2013 with porn star James Deen and has since participated in explicit webcam videos.\n\nAs for former \"Teen Mom 2\" star Jenelle Evans, she might want to put any potential plans on hold.\n\nThe 27-year-old temporarily lost custody of 5-year-old son Kaiser and 2-year-old daughter Ensley after her husband David Eason allegedly shot the family dog, People magazine reported. Eason allegedly shot the pet for biting Ensley in the face.\n\n'REAL HOUSEWIVES' STAR LEEANNE LOCKEN ACCUSED OF RACISM IN NEW TRAILER\n\nAccording to the outlet, the couple also lost custody of Eason\u2019s 11-year-old daughter Maryssa from a previous relationship over the incident. Evans was fired from the MTV reality TV series after the scandal, but regained custody of the children in July.\n\nThe outlet said that police later said Eason wouldn\u2019t face animal cruelty charges because Evans told them the story was made up for \u201cpublicity.\u201d However, Evans denied telling authorities that she lied.\n\nAs for Eason, he admitted to killing the dog to People in September, insisting he felt his daughter was in danger.\n\n\u201cI think that there are some things that are very important in this life and I think your physical and personal and mental sanity is one,\u201d Jones told us about the idea of MTV ever reaching out to Evans again.\n\n'SISTER WIVES' MADDIE BROWN BRUSH OPENS UP ABOUT DAUGHTER'S RARE GENETIC DISORDER\n\n\u201cAnd I think that should be everyone\u2019s main focus before considering any time of [reality] TV or anything,\u201d added the reality TV personality\n\nBut these days, Jones is focusing on her own journey with the franchise. \u201cTeen Mom: Young and Pregnant,\u201d kicked off Season 2 on Oct. 22 and introduced two new moms attempting to navigate parenthood.\n\nThe 22-year-old said she is eager to share the many lessons she learned along the way in raising her own daughter, Holly Lockett-Smith, 2.\n\n\u201cI would tell them that no one\u2019s perfect,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make mistakes, a ton of them. And they\u2019ve got to learn from them. They\u2019ve just got to do the best that they can.\n\nJANA DUGGAR DISCUSSES RELATIONSHIPS: 'IT DOESN'T HAVE TO END IN MARRIAGE'\n\n\u201c[Motherhood in front of cameras] has been difficult,\u201d continued Jones. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it has been difficult. But I think the support from my family and my friends have really helped me to keep going\u2026 There are moments where [the cameras following me] is just overwhelming. But in those same moments, you can think, \u2018Well, this conversation that I\u2019m going to have might be private, but it could be a conversation that someone else needs to hear.\u2019\u201d\n\nJones said she\u2019s aware that some critics of the franchise believe the series glamorizes teen pregnancy to young viewers. However, she said they should actually tune in and see for themselves before judging.\n\n\u201cThis show is rooted in real lives and real situations,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk about what\u2019s influencing people to do what, there are plenty of other shows that we could start with\u2026 I think at first you just feel the need to come out and comment back and defend yourself, say your truth. But now I\u2019m [in] a space where I know myself, I know my truth. I\u2019m not looking to defend myself to anyone.\u201d\n\nCHIP AND JOANNA GAINES\u2019 FIRST SHOW ON THEIR NEW TV NETWORK WILL FEATURE FAVORITE BAND JOHNNYSWIM\n\nJones hopes that those tuning in, whether it be longtime fans of \u201cTeen Mom\u201d or curious viewers, will learn from her experience that motherhood is far from smooth sailing. Still, she\u2019s a proud mom, one who wants to show others that you don\u2019t have to pile on the pressure to feel like you\u2019re doing a good job.\n\n\u201cI hope they can just see that no one\u2019s perfect,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThere\u2019s no handbook. And even if you are on national TV, there\u2019s still no handbook. Everyone is just taking it day by day. That\u2019s important, to just take it day by day.\u201d\n\n\"Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant\" airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on MTV.", "description": "Ashley Jones doesn\u2019t expect former \u201cTeen Mom 2\u201d star Jenelle Evans to chronicle her journey in being a parent on camera again anytime soon.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/25/694940094001_6097798517001_6097807535001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
