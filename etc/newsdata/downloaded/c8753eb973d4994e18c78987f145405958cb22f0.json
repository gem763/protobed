Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAlthough Daryl Morey had quickly deleted the tweet on the weekend, sportswear brand Li-Ning and sponsor Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center said on Sunday they were suspending cooperation with the Rockets.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\u201d Morey tweeted, adding he had now considered other perspectives.\n\n\u201cMy tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star and helped build the NBA\u2019s following in China.\n\nMorey\u2019s initial tweet included an image captioned: \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong\u201d. The post has since been removed and team owner Tilman Fertitta went on Twitter to distance the team from the statement.\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey does not speak for the Houston Rockets,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cOur presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the NBA internationally and we are not a political organization.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets, playing games in Japan, could not be reached for comment outside of business hours.\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said it recognised Morey\u2019s views have \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d it said.\n\nShortly after their statements, Morey and the NBA faced a backlash on social media.\n\n\u201cAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong,\u201d Texas Senator Ted Cruz said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNow, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.\u201d\n\n\u2018STRONG CONDEMNATION\u2019\n\nSportswear brand Li-Ning on Sunday strongly condemned Morey\u2019s initial tweet in support of anti-government protests that have plunged Chinese-ruled Hong Kong into its worst political crisis in decades and a major challenge to Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe want to express our indignation and strong condemnation,\u201d read a statement from Li-Ning, published on the Twitter-like Weibo platform. \u201cWe have already stopped our cooperation with the Houston Rockets, and continue to urge them to give a clear answer on this matter.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s SPD Bank also said on Sunday that it has suspended related marketing activities and publicity.\n\nNeither statements said whether the decisions were permanent. The pressure on the Houston Rockets has not purely been about business.\n\nShortly after the announcement by both businesses, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s sports channel said it would halt any further broadcasts of Rockets\u2019 games starting on Sunday.\n\nThe Chinese consulate general in Houston also issued a statement saying it \u201cmade stern representations to the Rockets and requested them to clarify, to immediately correct any mistakes, and to eliminate any negative influences\u201d.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association, chaired by Yao, said it was suspending \u201cexchanges and cooperation\u201d with the Rockets.\n\n\u201cHouston Rockets General Manager Morey publicly made an inappropriate comment related to Hong Kong,\u201d it said on Weibo.\n\nIt did not detail the nature of the cooperation or how long the suspension would last. Reuters\u2019 telephone calls to the association to seek comment went unanswered.\n\nBasketball fans in China also criticised the Rockets on Weibo.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cI watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I\u2019m still a Chinese person first and foremost,\u201d said one user in response to the basketball association\u2019s announcement.\n\nAnother said: \u201cWe Chinese basketball fans call on either Morey to apologise or the Rockets to fire Morey. If this doesn\u2019t happen, then we call on fans to boycott watching Rockets games.\u201d", "description": "The general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team apologised on Monday for a tweet in support of Hong Kong protests, saying he did not intend to offend fans in China, where business partners halted work with the NBA team.", "authors": ["Huizhong Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437911665&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950FK", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
