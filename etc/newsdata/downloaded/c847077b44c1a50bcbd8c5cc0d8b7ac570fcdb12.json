Officers will still be assigned as security.\n\nThe new rule quickly drew the ire of members of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, which sees the timing as a direct jab at the president, who is determined to flip the state's 10 electoral votes to the GOP.\n\nILHAN OMAR SAYS TRUMP 'TERRIFIED' OF HER 'INTERSECTIONALITY' AS A WOMAN, IMMIGRANT, MUSLIM\n\nChief Arradondo pushed back at the notion that the move was political in a news conference last week, saying that the department is \"not showing favor or bias toward a particular political party or candidate,\" and that the step has been under consideration for a year after local constituents protested officers in uniform endorsing local and state politicians.\n\n\"I don't want the Minneapolis Police Department to be politicized at all,\" said Arradondo.\n\nThe police union has responded by creating red \"Cops for Trump\" shirts for the officers and others to wear, selling online for $20.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"In compliance with policy, we don't want any issue,\" Kroll noted. \"So, we just thought you know what we'll turn the place into a sea of red with the shirts we designed. And, they're available and we can't keep them on the shelves. They've been selling out as fast as they come in!\"\n\nKroll pointed out that, under previous administrations, officers in Minneapolis were ordered to stand behind presidents, calling out local politicians as \"very left.\"\n\nFox News' Vandana Rambaran contributed to this report.", "description": "The mayor of Minneapolis is trying to \"antagonize\" and \"bully\" President Trump to discourage him from coming to the historically blue state, President of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis Lieutenant Bob Kroll said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/212aaa51-trump-split.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
