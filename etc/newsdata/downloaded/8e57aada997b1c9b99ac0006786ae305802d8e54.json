To celebrate, News Media Canada is rallying Canadians to come together to show their support for newspaper journalism.\n\n\u201cThe need for reliable, fact-based news reporting is critical, now more than ever,\u201d said Bob Cox, Chair of News Media Canada, the association that represents the Canadian news media industry. \u201cStudies show that 8 in 10 Canadians read a newspaper each and every week. This National Newspaper Week, we invite those readers to become advocates for the Canadian newspaper industry, and to vocalize their support for the important work being done by newspapers from coast to coast. Let\u2019s send a message to Canadian businesses, advertisers, to all levels of government, and to newspaper journalists that newspapers matter.\u201d\n\nCanadians are encouraged to pick up a copy of their local newspaper or subscribe this week, to visit local businesses who advertise in a Canadian newspaper, and to show their support for the Canadian newspaper industry on social media by posting a photo of themselves with their favourite newspaper and sharing why their newspaper matters to them, using #NewspapersMatter.\n\n\u201cNewspapers can\u2019t thrive without our support, as readers, as business owners, and as citizens,\u201d concludes Cox. \u201cDuring National Newspaper Week and every week, we need to stand up for the importance of credible, reliable journalism.\u201d\n\nA print and digital consumer awareness campaign supporting the work of newspapers will also run in local, regional and national newspapers across Canada.\n\nNational Newspaper Week takes place from October 6 to October 12, 2019.\n\nAbout News Media Canada\n\nNews Media Canada is the voice of the print and digital news media industry in Canada and represents hundreds of trusted titles in every province and territory.
