More than 1 million Californians are now without electricity, one of modern life\u2019s essentials that is frequently taken for granted. The blackout was done on purpose\u2014to prevent sparks from powerlines that could ignite deadly wildfires.\n\nBefore planned blackouts are through in two or three days, as many as 3 million Californians may go without power. On the surface, the blackout and its causes are simple to understand. But the deeper causes are complicated, span decades of public policy, and dozens of overlapping unintended\u2014and intended\u2014consequences of decisions, both related and unrelated.\n\nThe wind in Northern California is blowing in from dry Nevada, as it often does this time of year. It\u2019s called the \u201cDiablo wind.\u201d In Southern California, the comparable current blowing in from the Mojave Desert is known as the \u201cSanta Ana winds.\u201d\n\nIn both cases, as the wind rises above California\u2019s mountain spine, then descends, it compresses and heats up. Forests, chaparral and brush, dry this time of year in California\u2019s Mediterranean climate, are primed for wildfires.\n\nThis Isn\u2019t Climate Change\n\nMichael Wara, Stanford University\u2019s director of climate and energy policy, warns, \u201cWe are having to adapt to new circumstances brought about by climate change.\u201d He estimates that this week\u2019s blackout could cost the state as much as $2.6 billion in lost economic activity.\n\nPoliticians, journalists, and some scientists repeat a common refrain: California is getting hotter and drier because of climate change. They ignore the fact that annual precipitation totals over the past 100 years show no statistically meaningful trend.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of California\u2019s fires being blamed on climate change. Last year\u2019s Sacramento Bee editorial about the deadly Carr Fire in Northern California was typical: \u201cThe Carr Fire is a terrifying glimpse into California\u2019s future,\u201d it declared, adding, \u201cThis is climate change, for real and in real time. We were warned that the atmospheric buildup of man-made greenhouse gas would eventually be an existential threat.\u201d\n\nBut California, unlike the rest of the nation, receives most of its moisture in the winter and the months bracketing it, while getting precious little rainfall during the summer. Further, California is drought-prone, and has been for as long as scientists can determine from tree rings and sediment records.\n\nThe bottom line is that California has always had a high threat from wildfires and always will. The issue is how will that threat be managed, accommodated, or avoided?\n\nPoliticians Blame Utilities Instead of Themselves\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Jerry Hill (with whom the author served in the California State Assembly from 2008 to 2010), represents many of the people who are without electricity. He called the blackout an overreaction, saying, \u201cI think they (PG&E, the region\u2019s utility monopoly) need to spend the billions they\u2019ve already received to harden the system.\u201d\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, supports the blackout as a preventive measure, noting that the planned power cut \u201cshows that PG&E finally woke up to their responsibility to keep people safe.\u201d So more than 1 million Californians had their electricity cut off today as the northern California electrical monopoly, PG&E, was forced to shut down its powerlines for fear of starting deadly wildfires.\n\nPoliticians blame PG&E for the recent fires that have ravaged the state, but some of the blame redounds to the politicians. Wildfires in recent years have grown more deadly because timber harvesting and brush clearing were greatly curtailed due to myriad environmental restrictions. In the meantime, crucial infrastructure investment targeted at improving the reliability and safety of powerlines has taken the backseat to the state\u2019s demands for a huge increase in renewable energy\u2014some of which, ironically, has necessitated the need for more powerlines to connect remote wind farms with the urban centers.\n\nLook to Mismanagement of Forests\n\nTo better understand how we came to today\u2019s blackout, it is useful to look to the past. When the gold rush led to modern California, early photographers chronicled the landscape. In George E. Gruell\u2019s 2001 book, \u201cFire in Sierra Nevada Forests: A Photographic Interpretation of Ecological Change Since 1849\u201d the wildlife biologist depicted a California countryside of grassland with isolated stands of pines and oaks. The native Americans in the region frequently used fire to shape the landscape to increase the food available for them, as not a lot of sustenance grows on a dense forest floor.\n\nIn this environment of frequent fire, brush was thinned, and the first pine branches started just out of reach of a typical low-intensity grass fire. But with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Americans came a thriving economy and the order of government. Trees were useful and valuable, and therefore harvested. Fire was a threat to towns and cities, and thus, suppressed.\n\nFor decades, up until the 1970s, California would harvest and replant about as much wood as could be grown through an abundance of sunshine, snow, and rain. But in the 1990s, concern over logging\u2019s effect on the spotted owl (largely misplaced, as time would tell) led to a massive slowdown in the timber harvest, especially on the federal lands that make up about 60 percent of California\u2019s forests.\n\nWith a decline in the harvest came a decline in the allied efforts to clear brush, build and maintain access roads and firebreaks. This led inexorably to a decades\u2019 long build-up in the fuel load. Federal funds set aside for increasingly unpopular forest management efforts were instead shifted to fire-suppression expenses.\n\nAll of this was clearly foreseen by the Western Governors\u2019 Association 13 years ago when it published a Biomass Task Force Report that accurately predicted: \u201cover time the fire-prone forests that were not thinned, burn in uncharacteristically destructive wildfires\u2026 \u2026In the long term, leaving forests overgrown and prone to unnaturally destructive wildfires means there will be significantly less biomass on the ground, and more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nDeadly Delay in Catching Up to Reality\n\nCalifornia politicians, late to realize the true nature of the wildfire danger, have finally started to play catch-up. Last year, outgoing four-term Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown reversed his longtime reluctance to active forest management when he signed two bills into law, both of which passed on the last day of the legislative session in what was to become California\u2019s deadliest wildfire year.\n\nSB 901 allocated $190 million a year to use prescribed burns to reduce the fuel load while improving forest health, while SB 1260 made three important policy changes to streamline the ability to conduct prescribed and controlled burns; remove air quality impediments to preventive burns; and prevent environmental quality lawsuits from slowing or stopping needed burns.\n\nNewsom\u2019s more pragmatic approach to wildfires and forests was signaled during his 2018 campaign when he volunteered in an interview that California had \u201cHundreds of millions of dead trees\u201d then noted that it cost his father $35,000 to clear \u201ca small little patch of dead trees\u201d on his property. While campaigning, Newsom called for improved wildfire surveillance and warning systems, better urban planning, and helping property owners clear brush. It looks like the legislature gave it to him, as he just signed 22 wildfire mitigation and prevention bills in the waning days of the 2019 legislative session.\n\nAntipathy to Low-Cost Housing Makes Things Worse\n\nIn all likelihood, these measures will prove to be too little, too late for rural Californians, many of whom flocked to build along what is known as the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) where land was cheaper and housing costs far less than in California\u2019s dense and heavily regulated urban centers.\n\nThe environmentalists who hold sway over much of the California political class chafe at these homes along the edge of the forest and chaparral, calling for development restrictions and special fire taxes to discourage low-cost housing in rural areas and around the suburban periphery.\n\nAnd now, as the result of forest mismanagement by both the federal government and California, many homeowners living out in the WUI can no longer obtain fire insurance. No fire insurance, no mortgage. No mortgage, no house. Today, it would also appear, no electricity as well.\n\nIn time, perhaps, these policies will force all but the wealthiest of Californians to live in cities, crammed into tiny, energy-efficient cubes, leaving the forest to\u2014once again\u2014burn as it may.", "description": "Before planned blackouts are through in two or three days, as many as 3 million Californians may go without power.
