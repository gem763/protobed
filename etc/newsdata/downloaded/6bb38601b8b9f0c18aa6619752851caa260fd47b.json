This bid is pending approval from Australian regulators. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: PSP Investments invested $1.1 billion in other Australian firms during its 2019 fiscal year. Those investments, which include avocado orchards and other farmland, will be complemented by Webster\u2019s water rights holdings. PSP\u2019s focus on agriculture comes as it\u2019s offloading private equity assets. On Thursday, the pension fund announced it had sold several investments funds to New York-based Reverence Capital Partners. That pullback comes as several of Canada\u2019s other large pension funds are focusing considerable efforts on expanding their technology investment exposure. PSP is making some moves in the space, however. In June, it participated in a US$205-million investment round for Collective Health.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
