REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\n(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) is opening up its face recognition technology to all users with an option to opt out, the social media company said on Tuesday, as it discontinued a related feature called \u201cTag Suggestions.\u201d\n\nThe old feature enabled users to choose whether Facebook could suggest that their friends tag them in photos, without giving them control over other uses of the technology.\n\nThe face recognition setting, available to some Facebook users since December 2017, has additional functions such as notifying account holders if their profile photo is used by someone else.\n\nPeople who opt in to the new setting will still have tag suggestions automatically generated about them.\n\nFacebook\u2019s face recognition technology has been at the center of a privacy related lawsuit since 2015.\n\nThe lawsuit by Illinois users accused the company of violating the state\u2019s Biometric Information Privacy Act, claiming it illegally collected and stored biometric data of millions of users without their consent.\n\nLast month, a federal appeals court rejected Facebook\u2019s effort to undo the class action status of the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe have always disclosed our use of face recognition technology and that people can turn it on or off at any time,\u201d Facebook said last month.\n\nThe company said it continues to engage with privacy experts, academics, regulators and its users on face recognition and its control options.", "description": "Facebook Inc is opening up its face recognition technology to all users with an option to opt out, the social media company said on Tuesday, as it discontinued a related feature called \"Tag Suggestions.\"", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425901493&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8221I"}
