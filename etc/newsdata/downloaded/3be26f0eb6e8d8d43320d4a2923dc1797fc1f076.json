And the caravan is so small as well, because I\u2019m 6ft 3in, and the caravan\u2019s tiny, and we\u2019ve had to do loads of intimate scenes in there!\u2019\n\nI actually fractured my little pinky toe, in the caravan doing a love scene!\u2019 Natalie then revealed. \u2018It was all the somersaults.\u2019\n\n\u2018You soldiered on though!\u2019 Jurell added.\n\nWho knew having sex in a tiny caravan in front of a camera team wasn\u2019t going to cause broken bones? (Picture: ITV)\n\nMoira and Nate have been far from subtle about their illicit sexual relationship, being discovered by several residents of the village while keeping Cain somewhat out of the picture.\n\nHowever, that all blew up last night when Cain cornered Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan), accusing him of being the one having it away with his wife.\n\nBut Pete knew the truth, and being kidnapped, beaten and tied to a chair is enough to get anyone talking and he revealed the sordid truth about Moira\u2019s extra-curricular activities away from work with Nate.\n\nCould things turn lethal for Nate, Cain and Moira? (Picture: ITV)\n\nNow it looks like Cain could turn killer for being betrayed by Moira and Nate \u2013 and the trailer proves that things get explosive as he corners the couple on a boat.\n\n\u2018We were both definitely out of our comfort zones doing some of these things,\u2019 Natalie said. \u2018As the week goes on, without revealing too much, there are some water stunts and things like that. It was a bit out of my depth.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf she thought she was bad though, it was definitely a shock to Jurell, who until filming the show, didn\u2019t know how to swim.\n\nMore: Natalie J Robb 25 soap spoilers: Coronation Street and EastEnders deaths, and Emmerdale explosion Shock death, Robron ending and 8 more Emmerdale spoilers Emmerdale spoilers: Nate sets out to destroy Cain\n\n\u2018Before the storyline came about I spoke to Jeff, who spoke to Nala, our production manager, and he mentioned the swimming stunt, and I said to him \u201cI can\u2019t swim!\u201d\n\n\u2018I think there was a massive panic but it was just the nudge I needed, so I took swimming lessons with my swimming instructor Dominic who learned me to swim. So I can now swim!\u2019\n\nWith truths set to come to light, what comes next for the troubled trio?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
