E.ON, Europe's largest privately owned energy service provider, has also signaled its intention to join the project along with anticipated other academic and corporate sponsors from around the globe.\n\n\"We are convinced the Global Climate and Energy Project will make significant academic and private sector contributions to the development of practical technologies to address the potential\n\nlong-term risk of climate change,\" said ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Lee Raymond.\n\n\"ExxonMobil is proud to work with a University of the reputation, experience and ability of Stanford, and to be among the select group of sponsors coming together to make this project happen.\"\n\nThe announcement of the project comes as some scientists have begun calling for a research effort as ambitious as the Apollo project to address both energy needs and emission reductions.\n\n\"We believe that G-CEP will play a cutting-edge role in pushing the frontiers of technology into new generations of energy systems. For ExxonMobil,G-CEP represents a powerful vehicle by which energy science will move forward to find economically attractive technologies that will be successful in the global market and vital to meeting energy needs in the industrialized and developing world,\" said Raymond.\n\n\n\nThe complex nature of the issues being addressed under G-CEP requires a long-term commitment to energy research and development, an area in which ExxonMobil has proven experience. ExxonMobil's involvement in the project continues the company's long history of advancing technological innovations and supporting scientific climate\n\nresearch.\n\nRaymond concluded, \"Our investment in G-CEP is a\n\ndemonstration of our long-held belief that successful development and global deployment of innovative, commercially viable technology is the only path that can address long-term climate change risks while preserving and promoting prosperity of the world's economies.\"\n\nAdditional information about ExxonMobil can be found at www.exxonmobil.com.\n\nAdditional information about the Global Climate and Energy Project can be found at http://gcep.stanford.edu.", "description": "Press Releases get your corporate social responsibility news and information out to journalists, investors, and industry professionals utilizing CSRwire\u2019s targeted reach.", "authors": ["Web Design"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
