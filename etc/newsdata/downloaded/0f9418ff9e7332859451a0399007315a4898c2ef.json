This could call into question Australia's human rights record and negatively impact the tourism industry.\"\n\nMisty Farquhar said the draft bill \"will formalise existing social power imbalances, which will then act as permission for individual discrimination\".\n\nMr Liveris said confusion over conflicts of rights should be expected if the bill is passed by Parliament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And there will likely be test cases to answer these questions. But also mediation would likely increase for workplace matters around equal opportunity issues, which can be costly in both process and compensation.\n\n\"Until these issues are resolved, religious freedom could be a lawyers picnic with business \u2013 and investors and shareholders \u2013 picking up the bill.\"\n\nHuman Rights Law Centre executive director Hugh de Kretser has warned doctors' rights must not frustrate non-discriminatory health care in Australia.\n\nHe said the bill prioritised the interests of doctors who may conscientiously object to providing services, such as an abortion or contraception.\n\n\u201cAustralia needs stronger protections from discrimination for people of faith, but the current bill fails to strike the right balance. It\u2019s good that the government has released these reforms in draft form so that the flaws can be fixed to ensure legislation that can be welcomed.\u201d\n\nEquality Australia believes the draft introduces religious exemptions to Australia\u2019s race and disability discrimination acts for the first time.\n\n\u201cExemptions to these long-standing anti-discrimination laws are completely unacceptable. No religious belief should overwhelm the right of a person to live, work, study, and access healthcare with dignity,\" chief executive Anna Brown said.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission told the consultation overriding existing discrimination laws was not warranted and would set a concerning precedent from Parliament.", "description": "Scott Morrison wants debate in Parliament on new religious discrimination laws by Christmas.\u00a0Experts say it's a potential legal minefield.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1918%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_9%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/807174674c3eb323d2f7ae192daef1b6e1a6dfa7", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
