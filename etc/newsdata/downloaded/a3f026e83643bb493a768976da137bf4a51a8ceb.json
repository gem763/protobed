The Wall Street Journal reported that the facility is already supplying customers at pre-attack levels.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, -1.62% the U.S. benchmark contract, lost 49 cents, or 0.8%, to $58.85 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after shedding 5.7% on Tuesday. On Monday, it posted the largest daily gain for the most-active contract since Sept. 22, 2008 and finished at its highest level since May, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nNovember Brent crude BRNX19, -1.21% shed 31 cents, or 0.5%, to $64.24 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, after sinking 6.5%, following the international benchmark contract\u2019s 14.6% rise on Monday, the sharpest percentage gain on record dating back to 1988.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi press conference on Tuesday put a positive spin on the situation after the attacks on Saturday,\u201d said Robert Yawger, director of energy at Mizuho Securities USA, in a Wednesday report.\n\n\u201cOf course, Saudis were under pressure to put a positive spin on events, or their customers will go to the United States to buy their light crude,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Saturday attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field, temporarily disrupted an estimated 5% of global production and it also heightened tensions between the Saudis and Iranians and unsettled an already tense relationship between Washington and Tehran. Iran has been accused by U.S. intelligence of being involved in the attacks, which the Islamic Republic has denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia is expected to host another news conference about its oil production later Wednesday.\n\nAdding to the pressure on prices was an increase in supplies from U.S. producers. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies rose by 592,000 barrels for the week ended Sept. 13, according to sources. The API also reportedly showed a stockpile increase of 1.6 million barrels for gasoline, while distillate inventories rose by 2 million barrels. Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nAnalysts polled by S&P Global Platts, on average, forecast a fall of 2 million barrels in last week\u2019s crude inventories. Gasoline stockpiles were expected to fall by 800,000 barrels, but distillate supplies were seen higher by 300,000 barrels.\n\nInvestors will also be focused on the Federal Reserve as it looks to assess the health of the U.S. economy and how that may affect oil demand. The Fed\u2019s policy statement will be released at 2 p.m. and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will host a news conference a half-hour later as crude prices are settling.\n\nElsewhere on Nymex, October gasoline RBV19, -1.70% fell 1.1% to $1.656 a gallon, adding to Tuesday\u2019s 4.4% skid, and October heating oil HOV19, -1.00% shed 0.6% to $1.979 a gallon, after its 4.5% fall.\n\nOctober natural gas NGV19, +0.60%, meanwhile, added 0.5%, to trade at $2.682 per million British thermal units, erasing a 0.5% decline from a day ago.", "description": "Oil futures are heading lower for a second day on Wednesday as crude-oil markets react to Saudi Arabia\u2019s report that it will fully restore some 5.7...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre", "Myra P.
