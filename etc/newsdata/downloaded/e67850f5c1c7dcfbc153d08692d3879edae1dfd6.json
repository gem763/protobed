Turkish officials, meanwhile, said a 9-month-old baby, of Syrian nationality, and a Turkish civil servant were killed by mortars from Kurdish-held northern Syria. 46 people were wounded in the rocket and mortar attacks.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said he called his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu on Thursday afternoon \"to express the UK's disappointment and concern about the military incursion into NE Syria, and call for restraint.\"\n\n\"The intervention risks greater humanitarian suffering and undermines the focus on countering Daesh (ISIS),\" he added.\n\nFinland, Denmark and India echoed the UK's condemnation. While several regional powerhouses, including Israel, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, also expressed their alarm.\n\nAn emergency Arab League session was called on Saturday to discuss the operation, while the UN security council is due to meet on Thursday.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He has defended his decision several times in the time since, often posting a series of messages on Twitter.\n\nOn Thursday, the president said he was talking to \"both sides\", and warned Ankara that it would be hit hard financially if it did not \"play by the rules.\"\n\n\"I am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS. Talking to both sides,\" he said on Twitter. \"I say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they don't play by the rules! I am watching closely,\" he said.\n\nTurkey has claimed the operation intends to create a \"safe zone\" to facilitate the return of millions of refugees to Syria.\n\nBut world leaders and aid agencies fear that vulnerable families, who fled war, will be forcibly re-located there and a military incursion in northern Syria, which is home to over 700,000 people that rely on aid, would cause a \"humanitarian catastrophe\".\n\nMany also say that Turkey's offensive runs the risk of Isis prisoners escaping from camps amid the chaos.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Kurdish officials accused Turkey of bombing a prison in the city of Qamishli holding Isis jihadists of more than 60 nationalities.\n\nBadran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters that the offensives will \" definitely reduce and weaken\" their ability to guard Isis prisons as troops will need to be diverted to the front.\n\nThis attack will definitely reduce and weaken the guarding system for those [Isis] militants in the prisons Badran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official\n\n\"This could lead to their escape or to behaviours that may get out of the control of the security forces,\" he added.\n\nMr Erdogan said earlier said that Turkey would retain Isis fighters in its custody while deporting others to their countries of origin \u2014 if they could accept them.\n\nHe added women and children of the Isis would go through a rehabilitation program and vowed that Isis \"will not have a presence in this area again.\"\n\nHe also claimed that \u201c109 terrorists have been killed so far\u201d referring to the Kurdish-led forces.\n\nRami Abdurrahman, from monitoring group The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told The Independent that number was \"hugely inflated\".\n\nHe said that 19 members of the SDF and its allies had been killed, and 40 others wounded.\n\n\"Erdogan's number of 109 dead is hugely inflated. This is 10 times the real number,\" he added.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s president has threatened to send millions of Syrian refugees to Europe\u00a0if the European Union labelled its military operation underway in\u00a0Syria an \u201cinvasion\u201d. \u201cWe will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way,\u201d Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech to lawmakers from his AK Party on Thursday.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/15/syria-Akcakale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
