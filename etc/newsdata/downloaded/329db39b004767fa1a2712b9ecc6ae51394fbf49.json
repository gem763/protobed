It\u2019s for us just to bring a little bit extra to our game.\u201d\n\nRussia captain Vasily Artemyev, who has become a cult figure in Japan thanks to his bushy moustache, never-say-die attitude and thick Irish accent \u2014 the latter thanks to being schooled in Ireland, said Scotland were similar to the Irish, with dominant half-backs who look to control the game.\n\n\u201cWe will try to do better as we improve with every game at this tournament,\u201d the full-back said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try to improve more and to create problems for Scotland\u2019s defence and put their attacks under pressure.\u201d", "description": "Hamamatsu (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Scotland are targeting a bonus-point victory, and nothing less, over Russia on Wednesday to set up a Pool A showdown with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/8bb478_scotland-players-are-aiming-bonus-point-win-russia-scots-eye-russian-springboard-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
