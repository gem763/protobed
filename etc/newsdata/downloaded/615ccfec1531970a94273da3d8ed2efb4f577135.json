Posted by JOE.co.uk on Tuesday, 22 October 2019\n\n'I can see what Roy Keane is saying,' said the former Fulham midfielder.\n\n'I remember being at Arsenal when I was in the youth system. I was at Highbury with my match day programme and he told me to f*** off because he was going out to war against Arsenal.\n\n'It was a tight tunnel and I was just like \"okay\", but now looking back on it I know what it means to him. They were going down there and they're arch rivals.'\n\nSidwell was a youth player at Arsenal before leaving the club for Reading in 2003\n\nKeane, now a Sky Sports pundit, embodied a no-nonsense footballer - especially in his Manchester United days. Most notably, the Irish midfielder struck up quite the rivalry with Arsenal's centre midfielder Patrick Vieira in the early 2000's.\n\nBetween the 1995-96 and 2003-04 Premier League seasons, only Manchester United and Arsenal won the title - showcasing their dominance on English football in this era and that always led to feisty encounters when the two met on a match day.\n\nDespite Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson's fiery touchline relationship, it was always Roy Keane's battles with Patrick Vieira that added the most flavour to the historic Premier League match-up.\n\nTheir frequent spats between the two would not always occur on the pitch, however, as they once almost came to blows in the tunnel before a Premier League match in 2005.\n\nRoy Keane (left) had a fierce rivalry with Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira in the 2000s", "description": "Steve Sidwell (left) received the cold shoulder from ex-Manchester United legend Roy Keane (right).
