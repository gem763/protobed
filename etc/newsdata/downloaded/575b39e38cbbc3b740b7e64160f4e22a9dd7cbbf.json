The only question is which Dan will it be: Democrat Dan McCready or Republican Dan Bishop? Polling indicates the Dans were in a virtual dead heat heading into election day.\n\nTo review: Tuesday\u2019s race, which marks the conclusion of the 2018 midterms, is the second time McCready, a former Marine-turned-McKinsey consultant, has stood for election in NC-9 in the last year. In November, the results of his race against Republican pastor Mark Harris were invalidated after evidence surfaced that Harris\u2019s campaign contractor tampered with absentee ballots. (In February, the operative, McCrae Dowless, was indicted on three felony charges of obstruction of justice, two charges of conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice and two charges of possession of absentee ballot.)\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nA do-over was declared, but Harris declined the rematch. Enter Republican State Senator Dan Bishop, who\u2019s best known as the architect of North Carolina\u2019s disastrous bathroom bill that reportedly cost the state some $3.7 billion before it was repealed. Bishop\u2019s strategy has been to go all-in on Trump. When asked to name his top priority, Bishop told Politico on Monday, \u201cI think defending the president \u2014 and being vocal about that \u2014 will be a role I intend to take immediately.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has transferred the maximum $2,000 campaign funds to Bishop and hosted fundraisers with administration officials. Bishop toured the district with Mike Pence on Monday, before topping the day off with a massive rally featuring the president himself at Crown Complex in Fayetteville. \u201cTomorrow you will head to the polls to elect a congressman who will always put America first \u2014 Dan Bishop,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTomorrow is your chance to send a message to the America-hating Left.\u201d\n\nThe district favors Republicans. The Cook Political Report rates it as more Republican than the average U.S. Congressional district by 8 percentage points; the GOP has held the seat for the last 56 years; Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in 2016. All of those conditions are why it was remarkable that McCready came so close to capturing it in 2018.\n\nA granular analysis by Old North State Politics found that when McCready ran in \u201818, there were big shifts from the usual voting behavior in two counties where the lion\u2019s share of NC 9th\u2019s voters reside. Mecklenburg County went from 58 percent Republican in 2016 to 54 percent Democratic in 2018, while Union dropped from its 68 percent Republican to 59 percent Republican. The electorate in 2018 was 35 percent Republican, 37 percent Democrat and 28 percent unaffiliated. The same analysis shows early voting is up 56 percent compared to 2018.\n\nBoth parties have placed a priority on the race, pouring more than $11 million into the district. McCready spent $4.7 million on the race compared to Bishop\u2019s $1.7 million, but outside GOP groups including the National Republican Congressional Committee and Congressional Leadership Fund have spent a combined $5.4 million.\n\n(A second, less suspenseful race to fill late Republican Congressman Walter Jones\u2019s seat is also taking place in North Carolina Tuesday; the Republican, Greg Murphy, is expected to win that seat easily.)\n\n\u201cIt was a very close race,\u201d Trump told reporters on Monday, before departing for the rally North Carolina. \u201cI think it\u2019s getting less close. If you look at the numbers from two weeks ago \u2014 and I got involved about two weeks ago \u2014 and the numbers have gone way up. I think Dan has a very good chance of winning the election.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s certainly right about that: Dan has a 100 percent chance of winning.
