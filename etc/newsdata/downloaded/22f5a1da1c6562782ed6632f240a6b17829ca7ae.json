Who needs a Nintendo when you can grow a gourd?\n\nNow, the pumpkin farm he helped create \u2013 owned by his parents, Keith and Katherine \u2013 is the UK\u2019s largest.\n\nJames employs 35 staff to run Maxey\u2019s Farn, which is open from 9 to 5 seven days a week in the run-up to Halloween.\n\nCustomers can pick-up as many pumpkins as they like and pay depending on the size of the fruit, with prices ranging from \u00a32 for smaller ones to \u00a310 for the largest.\n\nAs strange as it may sound for a 13-year-old to start growing pumpkins on a whim and then end up with a successful business, it gets stranger.\n\nJames doesn\u2019t even like pumpkin.\n\nNow he has the UK\u2019s largest pumpkin farm (Picture: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\nHe said: \u2018I roasted one last year because I thought I should at least try eating one but I wasn\u2019t keen.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFascinating.\n\nEach year James and his family have to grow more pumpkins to keep up with demand, as in previous years the farm has been so popular they\u2019ve run out before Halloween.\n\nWhen James started out he only grew enough pumpkins to sell to his friends for some extra pocket money.\n\nSeven years later, he now harvests 25,000 pumpkins each autumn.\n\nHe grows thousands of pumpkins a year (Picture: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\nThis time they\u2019ve grown a massive stash so everyone can carve their jack o\u2019 lanterns.\n\nThe process begins in the spring, when James buys thousands of pumpkin seeds from a supplier in Lincolnshire, which he then plants in the fields with a converted planter attached to a tractor.\n\nThe business has been so successful that James left school at 16.\n\n\u2018I started when I was 13 next to the farm shop with a little half-an-acre field with about 200 pumpkins in it which I sold to my school friends,\u2019 says James.\n\n\u2018Every year I planted more and more and now I\u2019ve about five or six acres.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t even like pumpkin (Picture: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\n\u2018Any pumpkins which are left over get chopped up and ploughed back into the soil so nothing is wasted.\n\n\u2018The soil around this area has quite a lot of clay in it which I think helps our pumpkins maintain their deep dark orange colour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In supermarkets pumpkins tend to be quite light and almost yellow but ours have a nice dark colour to them which people like.\n\n\u2018I have always wanted to be out and could never sit in a classroom or anything.\n\n\u2018I have always got to be out doing something.\u2019\n\nMORE: When should you first feel your baby move during pregnancy?\n\nMORE: I thought I knew what a heroin addict looked like, then I became one\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "James Maxey began growing pumpkins to earn an extra bit of pocket money.
