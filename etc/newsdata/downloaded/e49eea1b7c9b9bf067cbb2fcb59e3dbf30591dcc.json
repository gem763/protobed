This action \u2014 in relation to misrepresentations in relation to the data Google collects, keeps and uses \u2014has never been taken before,\u201d he added.\n\nGoogle said it was reviewing the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe continue to engage with the ACCC and intend to defend this matter,\u201d Google said in a statement.\n\nThe commission alleges that between January 2017 and late 2018, people setting up their\n\nGoogle accounts on phones and tablets would have incorrectly believed that \u201cLocation History\u201d was the only setting that affected whether the company was collecting a user\u2019s location data.\n\nIn fact, the setting \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d also had to be switched off if users didn\u2019t want their location data collected.\n\n\u201cWhen people had their location history turned off, they may have felt that Google was not collecting their location data and recording it and keeping it, but in fact they were,\u201d Sims said.\n\n\u201cSo you could have been walking around the city ... thinking that your location history wasn\u2019t being collected, when in fact it was being collected and it was being kept,\u201d he added.\n\nSims said the watchdog believed some of the alleged behavior has continued. His commission will ask Google to admit the actions and promise to stop.\n\nThe commission also plans to ask the court to impose penalties, he said.", "description": "The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleged the technology giant mislead Android users about how their data was used.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT827_google_ZG_20191023062702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
