But it\u2019s not over until the Olympics are over. Construction is dangerous and every worker you save makes a difference.\u201d\n\nThe Japan Sport Council - a national government body - is building the $1.25 billion national stadium, and the Olympic Village is being built by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.\n\nYuson said BWI, based in Switzerland, has interviewed 50 workers in Tokyo to gain a picture of labor practices at Olympic venues. He said the union was not granted access to the workers, and many who spoke fear they may lose their jobs if their names are revealed.\n\nHe said the majority are Japanese with a mix of Vietnamese, Chinese and Filipinos.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t believe me, they can listen to these workers,\u201d Yuson said.\n\nDeath by overwork, known as \u201ckaroshi,\u201d is a problem in Japan where long working hours are common. Yuson also noted that many construction sites have signs about health and safety written only in Japanese, unhelpful for foreign workers.\n\nYuson said 300 workers - Japanese and non-Japanese - die annually on construction work in Japan.\n\nJapan\u2019s labor ministry, in a report issued 10 months ago, said two workers have died on projects for the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nYuson said he has asked the International Olympic Committee to step in, perhaps using leverage on the Tokyo organizing committee.\n\n\u201cThe IOC doesn\u2019t push,\u201d he said.\n\nMany sports governing bodies have signed up the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which spell out practices for businesses and government. They include soccer governing bodies FIFA and UEFA, the Commonwealth Games Federation, the International Paralympic Committee and Qatar\u2019s 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe IOC has added the UN guidelines to host city contracts that come into effect with the 2024 Paris Olympics. That excludes Tokyo, and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, where independent labor unions are barred by China\u2019s authoritarian government.\n\nYuson said Tokyo conditions have improved some since the report was issued earlier this year. But he said continued research had uncovered added problems linked to worker safety and overtime.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring legacy to the Olympics, not only to the multinational companies, or to the athletes, but to the workers as well,\u201d Yuson said.\n\nA report released last year by the national government\u2019s Board of Audit said Japan is likely to spend $25 billion overall to prepare for the games. This is public money, except for the $5.6 billion operating budget.\n\nOrganizers dispute the figure and say it\u2019s about $12 billion, though what are Olympic costs - and what are not - is subject to heated debate.\n\nTokyo projected total costs of about $7.5 billion in its winning bid for the games in 2013.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nStephen Wade on Twitter: http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An international labor union investigating worker safety and the use of migrant workers at venues for next year's Tokyo Olympics is asking for a joint inspection of construction sites and an open interview with workers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/olympics_tokyo_labor_complaint_31258_c0-175-3968-2488_s1770x1032.jpg?9b76d4d8f66db3698cc09eca2e966cf04da91379"}
