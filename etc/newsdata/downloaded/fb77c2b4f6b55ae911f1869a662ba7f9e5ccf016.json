The group is led by the prominent Democrat Eric Holder, who served as U.S. attorney general under former president Barack Obama.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the state were open about their partisan intent when they redrew maps in 2016.\n\nDavid Lewis, a Republican in the state\u2019s House of Representatives in charge of the redistricting, told fellow lawmakers he proposed a map that gave a \u201cpartisan advantage\u201d electing 10 Republicans and three Democrats only because he did \u201cnot believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, a three-judge panel in the Raleigh court ruled that the state\u2019s legislative map used for state-level elections was an illegal partisan gerrymander that must be redrawn. The lawsuit said that the congressional map, drawn in a similar way, \u201cshould now meet the same fate as the unconstitutional and invalidated state legislative maps.\u201d\n\nThe state-level fight was the first to reach trial since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that federal courts have no authority to curb partisan gerrymandering, though it did not prevent state courts from ruling on such cases.\n\nThe North Carolina Republican Party said in a statement that the lawsuit was an effort to tie up the state in \u201cexpensive legal shenanigans because they lost at the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about fair maps,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Democrats judge-shopping in order to subvert democracy.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats win a majority in the currently Republican-controlled state legislature in the November 2020 elections, they would be in place to draw new congressional districts in 2021 after the decennial U.S. census is completed.", "description": "North Carolina Democrats filed a new legal challenge to partisan gerrymandering on Friday, asking a state court to order the redrawing before next year's elections of congressional districts they say are designed to entrench Republican power.", "authors": ["Jonathan Allen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
