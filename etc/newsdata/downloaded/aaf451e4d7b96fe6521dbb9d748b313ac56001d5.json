The only indicator is a listing in the app info section of the infected phone\u2019s settings.\n\nThe lack of an app icon means the malware cannot be launched manually. But to get around the problem, it relies on external triggers \u2014 like connecting or disconnecting the infected device from a power supply, rebooting a device, or installing or uninstalling an app \u2014 to run itself as a foreground service that minimizes the chance of getting killed.\n\nFrom adware to potent threat\n\nThe good news, if there can be one, is that the malware doesn\u2019t do anything particularly sophisticated, other than bombarding device owners with intrusive pop-up ads and spam the device with notifications for free games. But it could be easily exploited to deliver additional second-stage malware payloads given its meticulously crafted evasion tactics to avoid detection.\n\nThis could easily morph the malware from an adware annoyance to a significant security threat capable of installing other malicious applications on the device or even remotely taking over the device entirely.\n\nSymantec said xHelper\u2019s functionality has expanded drastically in recent times, although the researchers warn it\u2019s constantly evolving to target new victims. The unfinished code \u2014 with many variables labeled as \u2018Jio\u2018 \u2014 has led the researchers to suspect that the attackers may be planning to target Jio users at a future date.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, Jio is the second largest cellular network in India operated by Reliance Industries boasting of over 300 million subscribers.\n\nTo safeguard your devices from such attacks, it\u2019s always recommended that you keep devices and apps up-to-date, stick to the Google Play Store for downloading apps, and be extremely cautious of the mobile websites you visit.", "description": "xHelper Android malware capable of reinstalling itself even after being manually removed has reportedly infected more than 45,000 Android devices over the last six months.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fgoogle-play-store-apps-malware.jpg&signature=ffe18d83f8a328018ff45d068ef5818f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
