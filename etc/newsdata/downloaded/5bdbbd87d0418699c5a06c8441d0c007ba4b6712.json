The krona jumped on the news, with many having expected policy makers to abandon altogether their plans to hike rates.\n\nKnut Hallberg, an analyst at Swedbank, said the statement \u201cwas more hawkish than expected.\u201d\n\nStefan Mellin, a senior analyst at Danske Bank, said that in light of the \u201cworsened sentiment,\u201d it\u2019s now key that the Riksbank proceeds \u201ccautiously with monetary policy. The economic prospects are based on the repo rate being raised at a slower rate in the period ahead than in the previous forecast.\u201d\n\nPolicy makers in Sweden have kept markets guessing after showing they were ready to go against the monetary tide set by the world\u2019s major central banks. The Riksbank raised its main rate in December, and has made clear it wants to return to positive rates as soon as possible.\n\nBut with a trade war between China and the U.S., the prospect of a messy British exit from the European Union and broader fears of a recession, many analysts have questioned the Riksbank\u2019s tightening resolve.\n\nNordea, the biggest Nordic bank, said on Wednesday it thinks the Riksbank will need to cut its main rate to minus 0.5% before the end of 2019, with no prospect of a hike until late 2021. It says there\u2019s now a risk Sweden\u2019s economy will contract in the coming quarters, amid \u201cweak\u201d household spending and \u201cfalling investment.\u201d Nordea also warned of \u201cstagnant exports and lower employment.\u201d\n\nIn its statement on Thursday, the Riksbank painted a bleak picture of the global outlook.\n\n\u201cGDP growth abroad, which has been strong for several years, has now slowed and is expected in the coming years to be approximately in line with a historical average. During the year, however, sentiment has worsened, due in part to the trade conflict between the United States and China and the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU.\u201d\n\nMartin Enlund, chief analyst at Nordea in Stockholm, noted that the Riksbank made \u201cvery modest revisions to the rate path in the near term, but massive revisions at the back end\u201d equivalent to roughly 50 basis points lower than previously signaled in 2022, he said.\n\n(Adds economist comment.)", "description": "Riksbank Signals Commitment to Hikes, But at Slower Pace", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9d207f06c0dfa00c0797175dc02b5ea2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
