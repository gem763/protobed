Discount brokers Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and E*Trade Financial Corp. announced this month that they would cut fees to trade U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs and options to zero, sending shares plunging and fueling speculation about potential mergers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t focus on trying to drive a pure trading type of thing,\u201d Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told analysts on Wednesday. \u201cThe $0 change won\u2019t affect us much, largely because we frankly introduced it 13 years ago,\u201d and about 87% of the company\u2019s self-directed trading business is already done without commissions, he said.\n\nFor Morgan Stanley, commissions from buying and selling stocks represents a small portion of the firm\u2019s wealth-management revenue, according to its chief, James Gorman. Instead, the firm sees more potential to expand its financial-advisory services to households worth $1 million to $10 million, as well as those with more than $10 million.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the growth is,\u201d Gorman told analysts Thursday. \u201cThat is where the advice fee is very fair and very reasonable.\u201d\n\nAs brokerage shares fell after the free-trading announcements, analysts and industry participants speculated that some firms would come under pressure to merge or sell. At least one bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said it\u2019s not interested in buying.\n\n\u201cThe discount brokerage area is not one that we\u2019re particularly focused on,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
