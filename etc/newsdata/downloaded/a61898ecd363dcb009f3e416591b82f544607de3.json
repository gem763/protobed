We\u2019re being treated like we are some type of criminal \u2026 and that\u2019s far from who I am as a person.\u201d\n\nThe Council\u2019s Committee on Standards and Ethics, along with outside prosecutor Carrie Cohen, released a report this week accusing King of a wide range of improprieties, including misusing government resources, allowing his wife to conduct official Council business and then retaliating against staffers who he believed were cooperating with the probe.\n\nPamela Hayes, King\u2019s attorney, argued at the news conference that the Council member did not have adequate time to mount a defense and was being unfairly portrayed as uncooperative, a qualm that will be the central premise of an Article 78 lawsuit to be filed on Monday.\n\n\u201cI will give you an old-fashioned saying that most litigation people use: If they don\u2019t get it right, we\u2019ll see them in court,\u201d she said, indicating that the legal salvo will be designed to hold up the disciplinary process until a judge can examine what took place.\n\nHayes, for example, said the special counsel and the committee refused to reschedule meetings if King and his lawyers had conflicts. And in one instance, when the lawmaker was set to meet with investigators, they were kept waiting for three hours before being told that the committee and special counsel were not coming.\n\n\u201cI have not been able to give my side of the story that is in this document,\u201d King said Saturday, adding that he was not told of a closed-door meeting with Council members this week to discuss the case. \u201cSomething is wrong with that process.\u201d\n\nHowever, the committee wrote in its report that King\u2019s lawyers had been aware of the investigation for months and were given ample time to prepare for a closed-door hearing, which was scheduled nearly three weeks after a set of updated charges were announced on Aug. 21. In fact, Cohen and the committee argued, the lawmaker\u2019s attorneys had deliberately avoided coming in to create the impression that King was being deprived of his due process rights.\n\n\u201cCouncil Member King\u2019s attorneys engaged in a pattern of dilatory and non-responsive behavior designed to delay the hearing indefinitely and frustrate the Council\u2019s disciplinary process as well as a calculated attempt to lay a foundation to make the false allegations of denial of due process,\u201d the report said.\n\nKing and his lawyers had already taken steps to sue the committee over due process matters in recent weeks, he said in one of several arguments that King was being unfairly singled out for punishment by a committee that had ignored other complaints. King said, for example, that he had filed a complaint after being the subject of a racial slur in City Hall. He said his staff have also lodged complaints with the committee to no avail.\n\nThe Council is set to vote during a special stated meeting Monday on the recommended punishment, which includes a 30-day suspension, a $15,000 fine, the installation of a monitor over King\u2019s office, his removal from all committees, a guarantee that staffers can return to their old jobs and a prohibition on requiring employees to chauffeur King to official events in their personal vehicles without reimbursement.\n\nKing urged his colleagues to oppose the measure Monday and give what he argued is enough time to adequately address the allegations against him.\n\n\u201cWe need a 'no' vote for Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need [members] to adhere to justice, truth, and fair practice and the process. And that has not been established since day one. That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking for.\u201d\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s case is based off of both documentary evidence \u2014 such as emails that the report alleges show staffers used Council resources to plan a retreat in the Virgin Islands \u2014 and testimony from employees who said they witnessed King compare a photo from the city\u2019s Pride Parade to child pornography, among other allegations. Council Member Steven Matteo, who chairs the ethics committee, called the witnesses \u201ccredible and damning.\u201d\n\nThe punishment planned for King is among the most severe in the Council\u2019s history, topping a suite of disciplinary measures directed at former Council Member Allan Jennings, who was found in 2005 to have repeatedly sexually harassed female staffers.\n\nCouncil Speaker Corey Johnson and Mayor Bill de Blasio have called on King to resign while Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer and Susan Lerner, head of good government group Common Cause, have called on the body to go further and expel King.\n\nBut the question of whether the Council should remove an official who has won an election \u2014 in this case three times \u2014 has raised questions about subverting the democratic process.\n\n\u201cSince we voted for him, he clearly represents us,\u201d Rev. Paul Peart, senior pastor at the New Testament Temple Church of God, said at Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cSo if you touch him, you touch us. When you disrespect him, you disrespect us. If you undermine him, you undermine us. And we will be watching. And we will be voting.\u201d\n\nJohnson said last week that the standard for expulsion would likely need to involve criminal charges by an outside enforcement body \u2014 similar to the felony charges that automatically removed former Council Member Ruben Wills from office in 2017. And while Johnson said investigators had made referrals to outside agencies, King\u2019s attorney said Saturday that she did not believe they had been contacted by anyone outside the Council.", "description": "\u201cWhat I\u2019m going through, what my family is going through, is just not fair,\u201d King said.", "authors": ["Joe Anuta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3e/9e/32c40ae440c790b5aab06094d50c/191026-andy-king-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
