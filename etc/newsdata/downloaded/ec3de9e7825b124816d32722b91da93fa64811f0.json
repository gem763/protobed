And that inevitably makes us more pessimistic.\"\n\nStill, there is some good news - of a sort - for investors.\n\n\"From a market perspective, we remain relatively optimistic - if that's the word - that we can slide into a long-term stagnation.\"\n\nThe main preoccupation for investors at present, he points out, is that \"as central banks go back towards easing, are we going to get a normal recessionary response at some point?\n\n\"Or, instead, is this really just about the Japanification of the world and do you get a long-term stagnation rather than a traditional recession?\"\n\nThere are some grounds for investors to feel more sanguine at present.\n\n\"In a funny way, despite being pessimistic about the politics, and despite the potential for disruptions, we've sort of had so much bad news already, and it hasn't been enough to make investors panic and go back into cash.\"\n\nJapan, he says, is something of a template for the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What we've said for a while is that our bull case scenario is that the rest of the the world turns into Japan.\n\n\"That doesn't sound like most people's optimistic scenario. But I think the underlying problems of demographics, of an overhang of debt, of companies not needing to invest on the same scale as previously - the story that Japan was different looks more and more unlikely.\n\n\"And instead it's amazing how even economies like the US, and even Australia, seem to be moving in exactly the same direction.\"\n\nBut isn't there a risk for financial markets if global growth slows to a crawl, and investors start to worry that central banks no longer have any monetary ammunition left to fire up economic activity? \"There clearly is the possibility.\"\n\nMarket valuations are still far away from recessionary levels, as measured by credit spreads or equity prices, defying economic \"warning bells\".\n\nBut King points out that there are two ways that investors could respond if growth slows, and corporate profits come under pressure.\n\nThe first, he says, is \"that investors pull their money and go back to cash and we get something of a more normal market response. And we do worry about that.\"\n\nIn an era of ultra-low interest rates, \"the likelihood that we continue to suppress that normal panic mechanism, I guess, has to be higher than would have thought otherwise.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Japan is most infamous for over the last 30 years is not booms and busts, but long drawn-out stagnation.\n\n\"And this is what we increasingly feel we are seeing not only in market terms but even in fundamental terms, that companies that would normally be going out of business are remaining in business instead.\"\n\nCentral banks have played a big role in fashioning this new investment paradigm.\n\n\"Central banks may not have been very effective at reviving the economy, and certainly not in generating the inflation that they were hoping to. But they've been extremely good at squashing market volatility.\"\n\nAs a result, he says, \"investors have almost given up shorting things, and value-based investors everywhere have been going out of business, effectively.\n\n\"But equally those that remain in the market are sort of disillusioned - they recognise that they're buying for the wrong reasons.\"", "description": "\"From a market perspective, we remain relatively optimistic - if that's the word - that we can slide into a long-term stagnation\", says Citi's global credit strategist.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2429%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_86/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/273be43f1e4e08ddc39efd8b88a16e3107085b85", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
