The study, conducted by direct-to-consumer dental alignment company Byte Me, polled over 500 women and discovered inequalities in how women are treated in the workplace, even by other women.", "description": "It's a microaggression that not only makes women feel a loss of control, but can negatively impact their productivity.", "authors": ["Marcel Schwantes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a04cfa535876eaa008b5158-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
