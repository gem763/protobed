Several formerly hot housing markets, such as Seattle and San Francisco, have noticeably cooled this year.\n\nHome sales have picked up in recent months but remain modest. Low mortgage rates have recently encouraged more Americans to take the plunge and buy homes, but sales of existing homes have increased less than 3% in the past year.\n\nPhoenix, Las Vegas, and Charlotte reported the largest price gains over the past 12 months, increasing 5.8%, 4.7%, and 4.6%, respectively.\n\nSteady hiring and solid wage growth, along with low mortgage rates, have made it easier for more people to consider home-buying. Consumer confidence is also at historically high levels.\n\nHome prices slipped 0.6% in Seattle in July compared with a year earlier, up from a drop of 1.3% in the previous month. In San Francisco they barely rose, edging up just 0.2%.\n\nSmaller price gains may help boost sales further in the coming months. Home building is also now growing at a healthy clip. The housing sector has contracted and lowered economic growth for the past six quarters, but some economists now expect it will boost the economy in the final months of the year.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
