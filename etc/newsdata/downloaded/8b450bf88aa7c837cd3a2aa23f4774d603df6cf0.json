REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong private home prices fell for the third straight month in August, according to government data released on Monday, as increasingly violent street protests take a toll on the economy.\n\nPrices dropped 1.37%, steeper than July\u2019s revised 0.10% fall, and June\u2019s 0.3% decline. It was the biggest percentage decline since December 2018, when prices dropped 2%.\n\nDerek Chan, head of research at property agent Ricacorp, said the fall was within expectations.\n\n\u201cHome prices in September are set to fall more steeply and we may see a drop of about 2%,\u201d Chan said, adding anti-government demonstrations and the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war were pressuring the market.\n\nPrices still managed to gain 8.5% in the first eight months, although analysts and property agents are forecasting anything between a rise of 5% to a drop of 5% for full-year prices.\n\n\u201cThe property market performance this year will depend on the situation of Sino-U.S. trade tension as well as the local economy and social conditions,\u201d said Thomas Lam, executive director of Knight Frank.\n\nAdrian Cheng, executive vice-chairman of New World Development, said at the group\u2019s results press conference last week he expected a high single-digit fall in this correction.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s open economy is pressured by the year-long U.S.-China trade war and social unrest since mid-June over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.\n\nBut the housing sector has been more resilient than others, with new launches this month selling most or all apartments as tight supply continues to keep prices high.", "description": "Hong Kong private home prices fell for the third straight month in August, according to government data released on Monday, as increasingly violent street protests take a toll on the economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435398817&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T07J", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
