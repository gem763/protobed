The American model-turned-tech entrepreneur was a friend of Boris Johnson back when he was London\u2019s mayor. So good a friend, apparently, that he used to visit her at her Shoreditch flat; so friendly that she reportedly managed to join a trade mission to New York led by Johnson, despite not having been officially invited on the trip.\n\nThe man whose number she stored in her mobile under \u201cAlex the Great\u201d (to close friends he\u2019s Al or Alexander, not Boris, which is his middle name) lent her kudos by coming to tech summits she organised. She even reportedly used his name to approach the election campaign guru Lynton Crosby for a meeting. But most alarmingly of all, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is currently investigating exactly how a grant of \u00a3100,000 in public money came to be awarded to her (all told, she won \u00a3126,000 in grants and sponsorship \u2013 money that for many people struggling to get a small business off the ground would be the stuff of dreams). And that\u2019s where this story moves from the realms of gossip into far more serious questions about abuse of power and position.\n\nIf there was any kind of a personal relationship that should have been declared, any conflict of interest that should have been flagged up before cheques were written, any shady business whatsoever, then we\u2019re all entitled to answers. Indeed, yesterday the London assembly gave Johnson two weeks to provide \u201cdetails and a timeline of all contact\u201d with Arcuri during his time as mayor.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about what the favoured few get, but what the rest lose out on\n\nWhat makes matters worse, however, is that all this is emerging just as Johnson\u2019s government comes under fire for failing to step in and help Thomas Cook \u2013 the travel company that has collapsed with the loss of up to 21,000 jobs around the world. True, the billions Thomas Cook might have needed over coming years to stay in business entirely dwarfs the sums dished out to Arcuri\u2019s fledgling business, and there are perfectly good reasons for ministers not to pour taxpayers\u2019 money into a failing company. But the impression voters nonetheless get is of a prime minister who will go to the ends of the Earth to help his friends, yet is distinctly slower off the mark when ordinary people are losing their jobs.\n\nPublic sympathy is with the staff rolling down the shutters on Thomas Cook stores and reps helping stranded tourists home even though they might not get paid this month. Thomas Cook won\u2019t be the last big company to collapse in this era of rampant technologically driven disruption coupled with deep uncertainty over Brexit, and those in other vulnerable industries will be watching anxiously to see how the government responds. Expect some extremely bitter jokes about what exactly the steel industry, or the car industry or high street retailers, have to do to get Johnson\u2019s attention.\n\nAnd even among Arcuri\u2019s fellow tech entrepreneurs, there are likely to be awkward questions about who else might have got that grant money, that seat at the table in New York, that invaluable mayoral presence at their events if only they\u2019d had the right connections. For that\u2019s what people really hate about this: it\u2019s not just about what the favoured few get, but what the rest lose out on.\n\nBoris Johnson and the tech boss who called him 'Alex the Great' Read more\n\nIt should be said that Downing Street has denied any impropriety. Arcuri too says anything she received was as the result of her efforts as a \u201clegitimate businesswoman\u201d. But Johnson\u2019s refusal to answer any of the detailed questions about all this put to him by reporters en route to this week\u2019s United Nations summit looks very much like a stalling tactic, a bid to starve the story of oxygen. He will surely be hoping it gets lost in the enormity of everything else that is to follow Tuesday\u2019s supreme court ruling, which could yet plunge us into an early election or a constitutional crisis. But the two are not so easily separated.\n\nWhen parliament is sitting, able to ask questions or launch inquiries with legal force behind them, he will find it much harder to duck. Any threat to put parliament back into recess, or attempt to bury awkward questions about his past under all the sound and fury of a supposed \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d general election, will look as if he is avoiding scrutiny \u2013 not just over the realities of Brexit but over his personal integrity. Voters have long ago decided whether or not Johnson\u2019s character matters to them. But this is a public matter now, involving public money, which raises fundamental questions about fairness. The public deserves answers.\n\n\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist", "description": "His friendship with Jennifer Arcuri, and the funding she received, raises questions that deserve answers, says Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d6362b83487f1e7e92c3207ba2993686fcd2249/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=50ae64c7aaa5d4c97ead4aeb8444292b", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
