Joseph Dunford: U.S. faces 'Sputnik moment' in space race competition", "language": "en", "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) \u2014 The U.S. has reached a new \u201cSputnik moment\u201d in which the military must act to keep the nation\u2019s competitive advantage in space against adversaries such as Russia, China, and to a lesser extent, Iran and North Korea, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford made his comments during a ceremony at Peterson Air Force Base recognizing the re-launch of U.S. Space Command.\n\nHe compared President Donald Trump\u2019s re-boot of the U.S. Space Command to President John Kennedy\u2019s call to action after the Soviet Union started the space race with Sputnik, the first space satellite launched in 1957, and with 1961\u2019s first manned trip into space.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say that we\u2019re at another Sputnik moment,\u201d Dunford said. \u201cAnd you could argue that the stakes are much higher than they were in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon had a U.S. Space Command from 1985 to 2002, but it was disbanded in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks to focus on homeland defense. Trump said in December he would re-establish the Space Command with the goal of improving the organization space operations across the U.S. military and to speed up technical developments.\n\nSpace Command is not Space Force, a separate military service that Trump wants but which Congress must approve. In a White House ceremony last week, the president said Space Command represents a recognition of the central role of space in security and defense.\n\nRussia and China are placing greater emphasis on their space capabilities, and have developed technology and weapons that could disrupt or destroy satellites, Dunford said.\n\nIran and North Korea have less developed capabilities, they still pose a threat, he added.\n\nSpace Command has become necessary to not only compete, but will be essential to the nation\u2019s ability to fight wars, he said.\n\n\u201cI learned early in my career the value of seizing the high ground in a fight,\u201d Dunford said. \u201cSpace command will seize and hold the high ground.\u201d\n\nSpace Command\u2019s new commander, Gen. John \u201cJay\u201d Raymond, said he wants to deter war in space by focusing on building forces that would win a cosmic battle and keep U.S. \u201cspace superiority.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will develop ready and lethal space forces,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cWe will take our existing space warfighting culture established by the original United States Space Command, honed in the Cold War and hardened in the many conflicts since, and adapt it to today\u2019s strategic environment.\u201d\n\nThe initial Space Command headquarters is Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, which is also home to other units with space operations, including missile defense warning systems.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The U.S. has reached a new \"Sputnik moment\" in which the military must act to keep the nation's competitive advantage in space against adversaries such as Russia, China, and to a lesser extent, Iran and North Korea, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/us_space_command_14375_c0-21-3408-2008_s1770x1032.jpg?31ffd4c3265fd7033f9a53b6074347f96b8180c6", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
