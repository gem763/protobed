But developer Infinity Ward insists they\u2019re definitely not working on such things\u2026 at the moment.\n\nStudio art director Joel Emslie responded to some of the fan speculation on Reddit, with the short statement below:\n\nSigh. There continues to be misinformed and incorrect info being pushed about Modern Warfare. What I can say right now is that we are definitely NOT working on any kind of supply drop or loot box system. Also, functional stuff is unlocked through GAMEPLAY. Stay tuned, we\u2019re planning to release info this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the tone taken by Emslie, that implies any talk of loot boxes is somehow strange, there\u2019s plenty of wriggle room there for Activision to add loot boxes in after launch, which is exactly what they did with the last two games.\n\nInfinity Ward says they are not working on them now, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t do so later. Considering Blacks Ops 4 didn\u2019t get loot boxes until four months after it first came out, Infinity Ward could be working on exactly the same schedule and their statement would still be perfectly true.\n\nThe insistence that Modern Warfare isn\u2019t pay-to-win is good, but that obviously doesn\u2019t preclude cosmetic-only elements. And given the beta did include references to loot boxes we wouldn\u2019t take the statement at face value.\n\nEven Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled added in microtransactions after launch, which over the last couple of years has become Activision\u2019s standard operating procedure \u2013 apparently in an attempt to avoid them being mentioned in reviews and in official age rating information.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare is biggest ever PC install at 175GB\n\nMORE: Fans angry at Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Survival mode PS4 exclusivity\n\nMORE: Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare story trailer from Sony\u2019s State of Play looks super intense", "description": "This year\u2019s Call Of Duty will not have supply drops or loot boxes when it comes out this month, but what about after that?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ib1r7ny-177b_1571056071.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
