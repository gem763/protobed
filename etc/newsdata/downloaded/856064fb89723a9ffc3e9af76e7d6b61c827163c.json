No other global equity income trust provides a higher income.\n\nThe result is a fund that has 15 years of dividend growth behind it, provides a healthy annual income of 4.5 per cent, and pays it out every quarter \u2013 regular as clockwork.\n\nAlthough the trust\u2019s overall performance may look a little anaemic when compared to rival global equity income funds, manager Bruce Stout believes his formula is ideal for income-focused investors.\n\nNo other global equity income trust provides a higher income.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t overemphasise the importance of the trust\u2019s income and its growth year in, year out to our shareholders, most of whom are private investors,\u2019 says Stout. \u2018It is every bit as important as the growth in the value of their investments.\u2019\n\nStout currently holds 50 stocks in the portfolio \u2013 all are listed with no exposure to private equity or property.\n\nThe businesses are spread across 25 countries, ranging from embryonic markets such as Mexico and Indonesia to established stock markets such as the UK and US.\n\nMany of the companies have been in the portfolio for 15 years or more \u2013 the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor and Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (commonly known as Asur).\n\nStout likes companies that have so-called \u2018moats\u2019 built around them \u2013 barriers to entry that make it difficult for competitors to muscle in.\n\n\u2018Asur is a great company,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ve held it in the trust for 20-odd years and it delivers an attractive dividend \u2013 occasionally an additional special dividend when things are going extremely well.\n\n'Yes, the shares can go to sleep for a year, but it doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that it\u2019s a good business deriving rents and royalties from retailers and its airport car parks. And in terms of \u201cmoats\u201d, no one is going to build another airport in the Mexican tourist hotspot of Cancun where it operates one of the most successful of its nine airports.\u2019\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s \u2018moat\u2019, says Stout, is the massive capital required to compete in the production of semi-conductor devices that in Taiwan\u2019s case end up in Apple iPhones.\n\nOther key dividend-friendly stocks include tobacco giants BAT and Philip Morris \u2013 and Unilever Indonesia which is benefiting from a young population with income to spend.\n\nStout also holds a smattering of more growth oriented stocks \u2013 the likes of Intel and Auckland International Airport \u2013 that do not throw off the dividends other holdings do.\n\nThese are countered by a portfolio of emerging market bonds that produce an income in the region of 8 per cent a year.\n\n\u2018This trust dances to a different beat than most other global funds,\u2019 he adds.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t have the technology bent of some which means our performance can sometimes look inferior when the market narrows and focuses on tech stocks.\n\n'Equally, the trust doesn\u2019t hit turbulence when the tech market quickly unwinds as it did late last year. Our modus operandi is building a portfolio of diversified businesses that have their own individual characteristics.\u2019\n\nMurray International, run by Stout out of Edinburgh, is part of combine Aberdeen Standard Investments. Its annual charges are just short of 0.7 per cent.", "description": "Although the trust's overall performance may look anaemic when compared to rival global equity income funds, manager Bruce Stout believes his formula is ideal for income-focused investors.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
