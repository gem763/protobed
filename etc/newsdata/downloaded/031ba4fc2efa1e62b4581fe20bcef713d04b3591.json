The infection is easily spread and you can catch measles through direct contact with an infected person, or through the air when they cough or sneeze.\n\n\"Measles is most common among young children, but anyone who has not been fully immunised can catch it.\n\n\"The safest and most effective way of preventing measles is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are required to ensure full protection.\n\n\"We would encourage everyone to make sure their vaccinations are up to date.\n\n\"It's never too late to get vaccinated. You can check with your GP practice to find out what vaccinations you may be eligible for.\"\n\nCaptain John Strathearn, operations director for Serco NorthLink Ferries, said: \"We are following NHS protocols and instructions.\n\n\"We are working closely with the NHS, which is informing all relevant passengers and crew to ensure they have the required information.\"\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nShetland MSP Beatrice Wishart commended the organisations for working together, but added that \"swift and robust action\" must take place to curb any potential spread of the disease.\n\nShe said: \"This incident underlines just how important it is to prevent infection in the first place. We know that is best done by ensuring a full course of vaccinations in childhood.\n\n\"It is imperative that those on that crossing, and indeed anyone who thinks they might recognise these symptoms, take this advice seriously.\"\n\nBetween April and June 2019, 301 new measles infections were confirmed in England, according to gov.uk .\n\nMost cases were reported in unvaccinated people aged 15 years and over.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at Public Health England said: \"We\u2019re urging parents and their children, no matter how old they are, to check they\u2019ve had 2 doses of MMR. Measles is easy to catch and can kill. Vaccines are there to stop the spread of disease and save lives.\n\n\"It's never too late to protect yourself and others.\"", "description": "It is believed more than 240 passengers and crew members may have been exposed to the contagious disease when travelling on on the Northlink Ferries-operated vessel from Aberdeen to Shetland on Monday October 7", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16180321.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Nettle-Rash-Isolated.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
