For others, the Switch Lite a replacement for a Switch that has been co-opted by family (or become a permanent installation in the dock). And some people just really, really love that turquoise and yellow.\n\nThe Switch Lite finally dropped last week and, on the hardware alone, it's a lot nicer in the handy. The plastic's more colourful, it's a little thicker, the unit feels a little sturdier \u2014 and there's no issues with removable JoyCons. Of course, that means you lose a ton of functionality in the process, and one of the Switch's biggest issues is set to become even more pronounced on the Switch.\n\nNintendo Switch Lite: The Kotaku Review The Nintendo Switch Lite is one of the finest handheld gaming devices I\u2019ve ever used.

Nintendo could have made a ton of sales if they just kept selling the dock separately, because then they would have made a premium for those who wanted a new Switch. Engineering might have been a problem though: a teardown of the Switch Lite found it lacks the internal circuitry to export a signal to a TV, although I'm sure someone will rig up a solution of their own before too long.\n\nBut for those who grabbed a Switch Lite, are you happy with the purchase? How have you found it compared to an original Switch, if you own it? And what games have you found play perfectly well on the console, and what ones are suffering from that lack of extra screen space?", "description": "For some, the Switch Lite is their first Switch.
