He must now intervene to safeguard these workers' jobs and skills and a future for Ballymena by nationalising this business,\" he said.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nA former spokeswoman for Ballymena-based Wrightbus declined to comment, directing all media queries to Deloitte, which is to oversee the administration, a form of creditor protection that often precedes bankruptcy.\n\nParent company the Cornerstone Group slipped from a profit of \u00a310.9 million(S$18.5 million) in 2016 to a loss of \u00a31.7 million in 2017, the last year it filed accounts for.\n\nIn accounts published last year, it cited uncertainty in the UK market for new buses and the pressure of increased material prices due to a weaker pound. It also disclosed a \u00a34.1 million donations \"to fund the group's commitment to Christian, evangelical and other charitable activities.\"\n\nIn 2016 Wrightbus founder William Wright was the first major business leader in Northern Ireland to publicly back leaving the EU.\n\nLocal member of parliament Ian Paisley, whose DUP party campaigned for Brexit, on Wednesday denied that Britain's decision to leave the European Union had had an impact on Wrightbus, noting that its biggest customers were in the United Kingdom.\n\nMr Paisley described the decision to enter administration as \"an absolutely tragic body blow for Ballymena.\" But he said he expected the administration process will attract a buyer.\n\nManagement met with staff and unions on Wednesday morning to announce the decision, Unite union said.\n\nWrightbus launched a new-look Routemaster in London in 2012 to much fanfare, but the bus later attracted some complaints.\n\nIn 2016, Mr Johnson's successor as London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said in a written answer to public questions about the bus, \"Londoners deserve a green, affordable and functional bus fleet, which is why I will not be purchasing any more New Routemasters.\" The London Assembly later cited problems with the batteries and bus capacity.\n\nBut in May of this year Transport for London announced it had ordered 20 new zero-emmission hydrogen-powered buses from Wrightbus.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [BELFAST] Wrightbus, maker of London's red double-deckers and one of Northern Ireland's largest manufacturers, was placed into administration on Wednesday with most of its 1,300 staff set to lose their jobs, trade union Unite said. .
