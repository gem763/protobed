More than $US2 trillion ($2.95 trillion) in foreign direct investment entered over the past 40 years.\n\nIn an important regard, China\u2019s success seems to stand as an advertisement for authoritarianism. Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, has found that since 1950 there have been 43 cases in which an economy grew at an average annual rate of 7 per cent or more for a full decade. A full 35 of these booms \u2014 or 81 per cent \u2014 took place under an authoritarian government.\n\nThe story does not end there. Mr Sharma also found that over a longer timeframe, autocracies tended to lose their way either through sudden policy reversals or the leaden hand of the state.\n\nDemocracies, by contrast, generate stabilising effects that produce slower but more dependable growth.\n\n\u201cThe stabilising effect of democracy . . . accounts for a simple fact: every large economy that has seen average per capita income grow to more than $US10,000 is a democracy,\u201d says Mr Sharma. \u201cChina, with an average income approaching $US10,000, is trying to become a large, rich autocracy but it would be the first.\u201d\n\nBeijing has no intention of abandoning its political model. \u201cDue to China\u2019s vast territory and complicated national conditions, the governance of China is uniquely difficult,\u201d said the government report. \u201cWithout centralised, unified and firm leadership, China would have tended toward division and disintegration and caused widespread chaos beyond its own borders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis leaves China aiming at an unprecedented goal; a durably successful autocracy. But some scholars do not bet against it. Jean-Pierre Cabestan, for one, describes in a recent book, China Tomorrow, how Beijing is building a \u201cnew authoritarian equilibrium\u201d that could sustain its dictatorship for decades to come.\n\nAll this explains why Hong Kong, where authorities invoked emergency powers against the demonstrators on Friday, is so crucial. It shows the limits to China\u2019s autocratic vision.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is another data point illustrating the same troubling trend of a government that believes might is right and is totally dismissive of the enormous risks and potentially catastrophic consequences of its actions,\u201d says Minxin Pei, professor at Claremont McKenna College in the US.\n\nHong Kong illustrates how trying to impose elements of China\u2019s \u201ccentralised, unified and firm\u201d system upon a cosmopolitan population with an average per capita income of $39,000 \u2014 four times more than the mainland\u2019s average \u2014 can create a powerful backlash.\n\nPolice fire tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on China's National Day. AP\n\nThe animosity is deep and sometimes personal. Protesters have made posters likening Beijing to a Nazi regime, burnt the Chinese flag and defaced images of Mr Xi. In one frequent protester taunt, mainlanders are described as \u201ccaged birds\u201d too scared to emerge from behind their bars.\n\nThe current cycle of protests, which have lasted four months, is heir to the \u201cOccupy Movement\u201d of 2014. Then Hong Kong people took to the streets against Beijing\u2019s attempts to curtail democratic freedoms protected under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula through which Beijing reassumed control over Hong Kong in 1997.\n\nBut Beijing is finding that Hong Kong is not the only place to where repression does not travel. Voters on the island of Taiwan \u2014 which Beijing pledges to take back before 2049 as part of its plan for the \u201cgreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d \u2014 have also been alienated by the mainland\u2019s assertiveness. Recent opinion polls have shown strong support for pro-independence candidates in next year\u2019s presidential elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the west and the rest of Asia too, China\u2019s approval ratings have tanked. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre this summer found that in the US, 60 per cent of people have an \u201cunfavourable\u201d view of China, up from 47 per cent in 2018. In Japan and South Korea the \u201cunfavourable\u201d rating was 85 per cent and 63 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe US is particularly unambiguous in its official attitude. Having spent nearly 40 years pursuing a policy of engagement with Beijing, the Trump administration is now set upon decoupling \u2014 cutting ties in diplomacy, commerce, education and increasingly in finance too. The main reasons for this, say senior US officials, include the theft of intellectual property, unfair investment practises, state-sponsored cyber-hacking and human rights abuses in the Chinese regions of Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\nWeekend violence at the entrance of the Causeway Bay MTR station in Hong Kong. The invocation of emergency powers shows the limits to China\u2019s autocratic vision. Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe nature of the regime should be clear by its actions in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet,\u201d says Brigadier General Robert Spalding, a former senior official in the Trump administration\u2019s National Security Council. \u201cIt is a totalitarian dictatorship bent on spreading its vision of IT-based social control as a means of securing the Chinese Communist party\u2019s continued rule.\u201d\n\nThe US is also seeking to influence allies in the west to steer clear of certain Chinese technologies. The UK, for instance, is under pressure to eject Huawei, China\u2019s leading telecoms company, from its 5G network.\n\nThe South China Sea is another arena of rising anxiety. At least seven Chinese ships have entered Vietnam\u2019s \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d in recent months to conduct what appear to be oil and gas surveys of the area. Given that Beijing claims almost the entire area of the 1.4m square mile (3.5m square km) sea, its unilateral actions unsettled not only rival claimants to disputed waters but also nations that use its crucial shipping lanes.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese survey vessel [is] . . . seriously violating Vietnam\u2019s sovereign rights,\u201d said Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for the Vietnamese government, this week.\n\nSuch statements underline the symbolic importance of Mr Xi and his performance at the military parade. Though he set out the narrative of China\u2019s epic struggle against poverty and oppression over the past 70 years, there was one particular debt that he did not acknowledge: that to the west.\n\nFor China\u2019s rise, at least in its early decades, was enabled by the policy of engagement adopted by the US, Europe and other nations. They opened their markets to Chinese goods, made their investments in China\u2019s \u201cspecial economic zones\u201d, transferred knowledge, skills and intellectual property. But this aspect of China\u2019s recent history is no longer mentioned.\n\nInstead, there is a tough, uncompromising message to the world. In his speech on Tiananmen Gate \u2014 the hallowed spot once occupied by Mao Zedong as he proclaimed the new China in 1949, Mr Xi warned: \u201cThere is no force that can shake the status of this great nation. No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation forging ahead.\u201d", "description": "Beijing flexed its military muscle with a Soviet-style parade last week, and then Hong Kong erupted again.
