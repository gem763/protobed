This is costing India money they say, and is in need of urgent revision.\n\nImages courtesy: Reuters\n\n\"Quantum of 5G spectrum on auction is inadequate and at a very high reserve price,\" said Broadband India Forum (BIF) President TV Ramachandran. \"Current reserve price of 5G spectrum is too high - approximately 5 to 6 times higher than other countries and needs urgent revision.\"\n\n\"The unsold mobile spectrum has cost India Rs 5.4 lakh crore in economic loss since 2010. Forty per cent of spectrum since the 2010 auctions has remained unsold,\" he added.\n\nAccording to BIF, which is an advocacy group and think tank that measures the pulse of the telecom operators and ISPs in the country, the reserve price of 5G spectrum is far too high when compared to the average revenue per user based on the cost per MHz. Because of that, it's a clearly bad deal for telecom companies, who have therefore abstained from buying the spectrum. As such, BIF says the government needs to make more spectrum available, and at a more reasonable price.\n\nDon't Miss 113 SHARES 3 K SHARES 23.8 K SHARES\n\nThe last such major auction was in October 2016, the largest ever spectrum sale in India thus far. Yet, 1,300 MHz of spectrum remained unsold at the event, a massive 59 percent of what was up for auction. In fact, in the six auctions held since 2010, only 60 percent of the total quantity made available has been sold.\n\nBased on BIF's numbers India had 762 million active mobile connections in 2016 served by over 3,800 MHz of spectrum allocated to licensees, which is a conservative estimate. That means the spectrum that lies unsold with the government could connect another 278 million additional people. That's about 21 percent of the country's total population.\n\n\"If 10 per cent increase in tele-density leads to an increase of 1.9 per cent in GDP (applying the results of the ICRIER economic impact study), the financial cost of this idle spectrum can then be estimated to be Rs 5.40 lakh crore, or over 160 per cent of the financial benefit of Rs 3.30 lakh crore from all spectrum auctions so far,\" BIF said.\n\nEssentially what they're saying that pricing spectrum too high has, instead of earned India money, has instead lost us Rs 5.40 lakh crore. Right now, the 3.5 GHz spectrum is priced at about Rs 50,000 - Rs 55,000 crore for 100 MHz.\n\n\"Many developed nations across the world have assigned spectral resources far in excess of the quantum that is available to Indian operators. India has 185 MHz of spectrum, much far behind 370 MHz in the United States, 296 MHz in France and 260 MHz in China,\" Ramachandran said. He explains that we have a much larger population to serve, and yet we've been allocating far too little spectrum for it.", "description": "According to a broadband industry analytics group, India has far too little 5G spectrum on auction.
