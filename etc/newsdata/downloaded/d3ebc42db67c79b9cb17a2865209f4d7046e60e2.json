(AP) \u2014 In a tantalizing first, scientists have discovered water at a planet outside our solar system that has temperatures suitable for life.\n\nTwo research groups announced this week that they\u2019ve found water vapor in the atmosphere of a planet 110 light-years away in the constellation Leo. This so-called Super Earth is just the right distance from its star to conceivably harbor life.\n\nIt\u2019s the only exoplanet known so far to have both water and temperatures needed for life, the University College London team reported in the journal Nature Astronomy on Wednesday. But lead author Angelos Tsiaras stressed, \u201cThis is definitely not a second Earth.\u201d\n\nIts star and atmosphere are so different than ours, \u201cEarth-like conditions are not possible,\u201d Tsiaras told reporters. \u201cThe only question that we\u2019re trying to ask here, and we\u2019re pushing forward, is the question of habitability.\u201d\n\nA Canadian-led team announced similar findings Tuesday. In a paper just submitted to the Astronomical Journal for publication, these scientists suggest it might even be raining there.\n\n\u201cThis represents the biggest step yet taken toward our ultimate goal of finding life on other planets, of proving that we are not alone,\u201d the study\u2019s lead astronomer, Bjorn Benneke of the University of Montreal, said in a statement.\n\nDiscovered in 2015, the planet known as K2-18b is twice the size of Earth with eight times the mass. While it\u2019s thought to be rocky, no one knows if water\u2019s flowing on the surface. Its star, a red dwarf, is considerably smaller and cooler than our sun, a yellow dwarf, and its atmosphere is also different than ours.\n\nNonetheless, Tsiaras said K2-18b could help determine, \u201cIs the Earth unique?\u201d\n\nThe results are doubly exciting, Tsiaras noted, given this is not only the first Super Earth with water detected in its atmosphere but the planet also resides within the habitable zone of its star.\n\n(M.

On Wednesday, the scientists announced they discovered water on the planet outside our solar system that has temperatures suitable for life.\n\nThe research teams used archived data from the Hubble Space Telescope and other spacecraft to analyze the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Further observations are needed to determine whether the planet is indeed a true water world, using next-generation observatories like NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Ariel, both due to launch in the 2020s.\n\nFuture telescopes on Earth and in space should help uncover more Super Earths orbiting red dwarf stars \u2014 believed to be the most common planets and stars in our Milky Way galaxy. Super Earths are defined as having a mass greater than Earth but less than gas giants like Uranus and Neptune; more than 1,260 have been confirmed to date.\n\nWhile water already has been identified in the atmospheres of hot gas giants circling other stars, the latest findings represent the first detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of another type of exoplanet, Tsiaras said.\n\nA NASA tally currently lists more than 4,000 confirmed exoplanets and another 4,000 potential candidates. Most have been detected using the transit method, where telescopes watch for a slight, fleeting dimming of a star\u2019s light as a planet passes in the field of view.\n\nFor now, scientists know K2-18b takes 33 days to orbit its star, so one year there is one month here. At this distance, temperatures range from minus-100 degrees to 116 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 73 degrees to 47 degrees Celsius.)\n\nThe star, glowing red in the day sky, is believed to bombard the planet with radiation harsh enough to quickly inflict any human visitors with cancer, although \u201clife there may have evolved differently\u201d in order to survive, noted the London team\u2019s Ingo Waldmann. A sister planet, meanwhile, orbits closer to the star and is likely too hot to be in the habitable zone.\n\nThe cloud cover isn\u2019t too thick on K2-18b, otherwise it would have obscured the water vapor in the atmosphere, according to the scientists.\n\nThe surface, meanwhile, could be wet or dry. The London data suggest water vapor makes up anywhere between 0.01% and 50% of the atmosphere \u2014 \u201cquite a big range,\u201d Waldmann acknowledged. Either way, given the planet\u2019s mass, it would be difficult to walk on the surface.\n\n\u201cMaybe not quite your vacation destination just yet,\u201d Waldmann joked.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
