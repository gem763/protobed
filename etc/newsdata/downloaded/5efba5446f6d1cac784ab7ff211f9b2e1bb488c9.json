And over the weekend, he raised the bar even higher. According to the Los Angeles Times, he\u2019s the first African-American to own a studio outright, with no corporation or partners.\n\nThe brain behind the dearly loved character, Madea, recently launched his studios in Atlanta, Georgia, USA and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of black Hollywood to share the monumental occasion, including Oprah Winfrey, Cecily Tyson, Taraji P. Henson, Jill Scott, Whoopi Goldberg, Keshia Knight Pulliam, Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay, Beyonc\u00e9, Jay Z and Halle Berry, along with political figures such as John Lewis, Bernice King and Stacey Abrams.\n\nBack in June, Perry explained during his BET Awards acceptance speech (where he was honoured with the Ultimate Icon award) that \u201cwhen I built my studio, [it was in the] poorest Black neighbourhood in Atlanta so the kids can see that a Black man did that, and they can too. The studio was once a confederate army base,\u201d he said of the land, known as Fort McPherson, which was used as a Confederate Army base during the Civil War, when the southern states fought the northern states to keep Black people enslaved.\n\nAccording to his website, Perry purchased the land in June 2015. It now holds 12 sound stages for movie productions. He dedicated each soundstage to a Black person who\u2019d made strides in Hollywood, including the late Diahann Carroll, Essence reports.\n\nGuests were treated to an exclusive tour of the impressively huge studios. One tweep reposted a video of the tour and captioned it, \u201cTyler Perry ain't joking around! His studio is a whole damn town! What in the world???!!!\u201d and we couldn\u2019t agree more.", "description": "Tyler Perry proves that no dream is impossible after opening his own studio.", "authors": ["Nkosazana Ngwadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9442/7cffcbe036ad4d1a843f5d5734e44064.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
