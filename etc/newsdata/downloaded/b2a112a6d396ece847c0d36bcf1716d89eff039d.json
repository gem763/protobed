Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can simultaneously be any combination of zero and one. The difference means much faster processing speeds.\n\nGoogle GOOGL will now try to build \"a fault-tolerant quantum computer\" as quickly as possible. The company sees applications in designing lightweight batteries for cars and airplanes, as well as new medicines.\n\nRead More", "description": "Google claims it has designed a machine that needs only 200 seconds to solve a problem that would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to figure out.", "authors": ["Charles Riley", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191023061222-google-quantum-computer-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
