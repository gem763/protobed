That business has foundered in recent years as a surge in shale oil production in the U.S. has made it difficult for offshore oil explorers to compete.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nTemasek already owns nearly 21% of Keppel, which also counts private-equity groups BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group as investors. The offer made Monday at 7.35 Singapore dollars ($5.40) a share is a 26% premium to Keppel\u2019s S$5.84 closing price last Friday and would boost Temasek\u2019s holding to 51%.\n\n\u201cOffshore drilling is looking up, but it needs investment,\u201d said a person involved in the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the media. \u201cThere are no decisions yet, but the plan is to look into a merger with Sembcorp Marine following extensive yard consolidation in China and Korea. But if it doesn\u2019t work, Sembcorp Marine may be privatized.\u201d\n\nOther options may be examined aside from privatization, another person said.\n\nTemasek owns 49.5% of Sembcorp Industries Ltd. , a global business including logistics warehouses, infrastructure, energy generation and utilities whose holdings include Sembcorp Marine.\n\nSembcorp Marine\u2019s market value before the offer stood at around $2.1 billion and Keppel\u2019s at $7.9 billion.\n\n\u201cThe partial offer reflects our view that there\u2019s inherent long-term value in Keppel\u2019s businesses, notwithstanding the challenges presented by the current business and economic outlook,\u201d Tan Chong Lee, president of Temasek International, said in a statement.\n\nTemasek said it made the offer through its wholly owned subsidiary Kyanite Investment Holdings, which will undertake a comprehensive review of Keppel\u2019s businesses and balance sheet.\n\nKeppel last week reported third-quarter net profit of $110.7 million, a 30% decline from the same period last year.\n\nTemasek\u2019s move comes after Keppel and Sembcorp Marine reached long-awaited settlements with Brazilian offshore driller Sete Brasil in early October over a combined 13 rigs under construction worth billions of dollars. Sete stopped making payments on the rigs in November 2014 and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2016.\n\n\u201cNow the path is clear, we will look to make Keppel one of Singapore\u2019s best performers again,\u201d the second person close to the matter said. \u201cIf we are to compete in shipbuilding, we have to take the giants in Korea and China head on.\u201d\n\nChina and South Korea, the world\u2019s two biggest shipbuilders, both are in the process of merging their biggest yards. The combination of China State Shipbuilding Corp. and China Shipbuilding Industry Corp. will create a single entity with more than $110 billion in assets, and South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. would have more than $30 billion in assets after its takeover of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings made a $2.9 billion offer for majority control of Keppel, and the sovereign-wealth fund plans to merge the shipyard with rival Sembcorp Marine in response to consolidation in the ship construction sector in South Korea and China, people familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-119381/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
