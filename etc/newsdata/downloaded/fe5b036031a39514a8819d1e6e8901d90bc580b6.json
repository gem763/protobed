You can form your own view.

Really what we need to do is start breaking that down and then people won\u2019t need to come out because we\u2019ll all be seen as equal.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the full episode of Millennial Love here and stay up to date with the podcast by following The Independent lifestyle desk on Instagram here.\n\nThe Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships.
