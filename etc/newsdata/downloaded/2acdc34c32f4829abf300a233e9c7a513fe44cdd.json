Let\u2019s start things off with a bit of good news: \u201cFor the second time this year, an Iowa federal judge has ruled that the University of Iowa violated students\u2019 First Amendment rights when various religious student groups lost their official status. And this time university administrators will be held financially liable for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship\u2019s fight to stay on campus.\u201d\n\nAlso: American scientists attempt to read Pompeiian scrolls with new technology: \u201cThe two unopened scrolls that will be probed belong to the Institut de France in Paris and are part of an astonishing collection of about 1,800 scrolls that was first discovered in 1752 during excavations of Herculaneum. Together they make up the only known intact library from antiquity, with the majority of the collection now preserved in a museum in Naples.\u201d\n\nRoger Scruton writes in praise of nooks and crannies: \u201cThe much-loved villages of Provence and the Italian Riviera provide few examples of formal perfection. But they abound in doorways, passages and cul-de-sacs; in secret stairs and alleyways. Their walls are punctuated with votive shrines and niches; their windows are encased by architraves and moldings, often squeezed into corners to reflect the winding corridors of the life within. Basements sink away into darkened cubby-holes, and here and there, between the houses, there are sheds and troughs that serve the needs of the invisible gnomes who haunt the place.\u201d\n\nFamily bemoans fictional account of a relative who was sent to a Soviet gulag after surviving Auschwitz: \u201cMorris\u2019s global bestseller The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a novel based on the story of the Slovakian Jew Lale Sokolov, who told Morris how he fell in love with a woman he tattooed while he was in the concentration camp. That book has already drawn stinging condemnation from the Auschwitz Memorial, which said in a detailed report earlier this year that the book \u2018contains numerous errors and information inconsistent with the facts, as well as exaggerations, misinterpretations and understatements\u2019 . . . Now Morris\u2019s sequel to The Tattooist of Auschwitz, Cilka\u2019s Journey, has been denounced by George Kovach, stepson of Cecilia Kovachova, upon whose story the novel is based. The book claims to be both \u2018based on the heartbreaking true story\u2019 of Kovachova/Klein and \u2018a work of fiction\u2019. Kovach has described the portrait of his stepmother as \u2018appalling and extremely hurtful\u2019 in a letter from his lawyers to Morris\u2019s American publishers. \u2018It has nothing to do with the Cecilia that he knew, or her history as she recounted it to him,\u2019 says the letter, which goes on to list \u2018two of the most egregious \u2026 errors\u2019 in the book: the \u2018false\u2019 and \u2018patently absurd\u2019 storyline that Cilka is \u2018presented as being the mistress of not one but two high-ranking SS camp commanders\u2019, and that Cilka \u2018allegedly steals drugs from the Vorkuta camp hospital (supposedly to protect her reputation)\u2019.\u201d\n\nKyle Smith reviews Joker: \u201cMore than any comic-book movie to date, Joker, directed with a fierce commitment by Todd Phillips, eschews entertainment and dares to repel a sizable proportion of the potential audience. With an awful foreboding, it drills into the psychic pain of Arthur Fleck \u2014 failed clown, failed standup comic, failed human. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the creepiest performances ever put on film as Arthur, a product of the manifold breakdowns of 1970s New York City, here barely disguised as Gotham City. Phoenix\u2019s rancid torment jangles the nerves and turns the stomach.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn The London Review of Books, Sheng Yun writes about Chinese millennials, who are not that different in some respects from their American counterparts:\n\n\u201cA typical Chinese millennial hipster will turn up to see you wearing a snug designer jacket, really saggy jeans or super-tight leggings, and white sneakers. They\u2019ll be carrying an eco bag: not any old cotton tote, but one that\u2019s trending on Instagram \u2013 the LRB tote perhaps. Baseball caps and dramatic eyewear are among the most popular accessories. Unlike the urban middle-class generation that came before them, Chinese millennials (roughly, those born between 1985 and 2000) aren\u2019t particularly drawn to such luxury brands as Chanel, whose showy logo is considered too \u2018mature\u2019. And they\u2019re reading Sally Rooney.\n\n\u201cChinese millennials are a product of globalisation. Like their Western counterparts, they don\u2019t much like traditional marriage arrangements. We have smartphones to keep us in touch with our friends, single millennials might say, unlimited games to play and movies to watch, dating apps for hooking up, an inexhaustible supply of porn for solo sex (it has been said that porn forums in China are the most harmonious spaces on the internet, with users thanking one another for sharing content), numerous apps for ordering cabs and housekeepers, restaurant delivery within thirty minutes, fresh grocery delivery within the hour, dogs and cats to channel the sporadic parenting instinct \u2026 What do we need marriage for? In 2018, the marriage rate in China dropped to a new low of 7.2 weddings per thousand people; before that the divorce rate had increased for 15 years straight, to 3.2 per thousand. Two of the most commonly cited causes of divorce are disagreements over the division of household chores, and parental meddling \u2013 parents of only children can be extremely protective.\n\n\u201cThe most famous, or infamous, millennial in China is probably Wang Sicong, who was born in 1988, the only son of Wang Jianlin, owner of the Dalian Wanda real estate group and at one time the richest man in Asia with a net worth of more than \u00a320 billion. With 45 million followers on Weibo, Wang Sicong is a social media celebrity. A photograph of him gulping down a hotdog became a viral meme last year, and he celebrated his e-sports team\u2019s win in the 2018 League of Legends World Championship by funding an online lottery to award 113 people 10,000 RMB (\u00a31130) each \u2013 23 million netizens took part. Educated in England (Winchester and UCL), Wang Sicong\u2019s style is in every way different from his father\u2019s, which is quite low-key. Wang Jr enjoys conspicuous consumption, showing off his private jet, his fancy cars, his dozens of girlfriends (who, incidentally, all look the same) and numerous pets \u2013 his chinchilla is named Putin. However, there is one subject on which he does agree with his father: in China, there can be no real success outside the system.\n\n\u201cMost millennials are indifferent to politics. They grew up in the post-1989 world when China was at peace and enjoying double-digit economic growth. In China\u2019s Millennials: The Want Generation (2015) Eric Fish asks: \u2018Could the country\u2019s youth ever spark mass Tiananmen-like demonstrations again? Could their growing list of struggles ever cause them seriously to rock the boat? As they come of age, will they steer China in the direction of serious democratic reform, or will they carry on in the Leninist tradition?\u2019 I don\u2019t think millennials have either the drive or the incentive to take action: unlike former generations, they haven\u2019t been oppressed or wronged or mistreated. I have been interested to note the differing generational responses to Lou Ye\u2019s movie Summer Palace (2006), about Beijing students\u2019 experience of 1989 and its aftermath. My mentor cried when he saw it: he was a graduate student at the time and felt it was his story too. When I saw it, I \u2018got it\u2019, but I didn\u2019t cry because I knew it wasn\u2019t my story. When I asked the millennials in the office about it, they said the film didn\u2019t make any sense to them at all \u2013 they knew something horrible had happened back then, but they couldn\u2019t relate to it. People don\u2019t identify as idealists or rebels any longer.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, academics from Stanford and Peking Universities published a joint study titled The Impact of Media Censorship: Evidence from a Field Experiment in China. About 1800 students from two universities in Beijing took part in the experiment between 2015 and 2017. They were offered free software that would enable them to dodge the Great Firewall of China \u2013 which blocks almost all major Western news sites and social media outlets \u2013 and browse the internet without restrictions. There was some surprise when it turned out that even elite students in China had little interest in finding out what Westerners were thinking. Only 53 per cent of the participants had activated the software (even after repeated reminders), and about 14 per cent of the ones who had activated it uninstalled it shortly afterwards. Active users were browsing content which wasn\u2019t political. Only when there were quizzes with small cash prizes did the students visit the New York Times site or other suggested sources. When the free trial finished, the average renewal rate was low, and the users who did renew were more likely to use the software for Google searches or to access social media and entertainment sites rather than sensitive news.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: A cloudy day on Mars\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
