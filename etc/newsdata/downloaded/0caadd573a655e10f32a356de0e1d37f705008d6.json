The rally was not authorized, but at the point of the first tear gas rounds, protesters had not been confronting police. Only a few people had respirators to protect them from the gas.\n\nAt the other main march in Mongkok, in Kowloon, police fired rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at the crowd, which was also peacefully marching, before also firing tear gas. Protesters responded by shining laser lights and throwing objects at a police station.\n\nBy early evening, some protesters appeared to be gearing up for clashes with police, now routine after large marches. Outside the city\u2019s High Court building, demonstrators laid bricks down on the road along with traffic cones and metal railings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn what appeared to be a new tactic, they also tied trip wires made of fishing line across a road that has been the scene of charges by police during recent protests.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked sweeping emergency powers to enact the new law, a measure she hopes will stop the violence that has increasingly become the hallmark of the last five months of street protests.\n\nProtests were sparked by a now-withdrawn proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, but the unrest has now swelled into a movement seeking direct elections for Hong Kong\u2019s leaders and an independent investigation into the police.\n\nLam\u2019s ban, however, has so far only has only sparked more anger. Violence on city streets swelled on Friday night, with dozens of businesses perceived as pro-Beijing vandalized and burned. Some of the same outlets were also targeted on Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe city was placed on an effective shutdown on Saturday as the entire subway network, shops and most supermarkets were closed. The subway reopened only partially on Sunday, but announced it would close all stations at 9 p.m.\n\nHow it got to this point: The evolution of Hong Kong\u2019s protests\n\nMany are worried that the expanded police powers afforded by the law will only further a sense of impunity in the department, which is using increasingly harsh measures to suppress the demonstrations. In recent days, riot police presence has increased all over the city, with officers fully decked out in shields, helmets and sometimes, face coverings.\n\nProtesters have now added a new demand to their list of five, that had included universal suffrage and an investigation into police tactics. Now they are also calling for the complete overhaul of the police force.\n\n\u201cIn Hong Kong, we are seeing the police now covering their faces with black masks, almost like they have unlimited rights,\u201d said Yeung, 18, who only provided her last name citing the illegality of the march. \u201cWe have to fight back, and uphold the rule of law, because it is being applied with double standards.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday morning, the High Court for the second time rejected a temporary injunction on the anti-mask law, this time filed by a group of two dozen pro-democracy lawmakers. The court however will still hear a judicial review of the law and the emergency powers used to implement it, and has expedited the case.\n\n\u201cThe court obviously sees that there is an important constitutional principle at stake concerning our separation of powers, concerning the rule of law in Hong Kong. And that is why the court has agreed to grant us a very fast and quick hearing in the second half of this month,\u201d Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents the legal sector, said after the ruling.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best to fight whether it is in court, whether it is in [the Legislative Council] or whether it is out there with the Hong Kong people,\u201d he added, referring to the city\u2019s lawmaking body.\n\nHong Kong leader invokes colonial-era emergency powers to ban masks, sparking more protests\n\nHong Kong protester shot as police disperse anti-China demonstrations on National Day\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news\n\nAD", "description": "The move to ban masks has only unleashed more dissent in the city.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Timothy Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6MImBKVupbmBl1V_WG7RsU-2u-c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VSVKN3XIC4I6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
