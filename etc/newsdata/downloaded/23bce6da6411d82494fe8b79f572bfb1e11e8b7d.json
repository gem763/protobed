Quite idiotic, but in some ways, I do feel like a legend.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old also claimed that he had his suspicions pretty early on that their days on the programme were numbered.\n\nHe revealed he had a \"tingling feeling from the offset\", as he walked into Chantelle's house - his mother-in-law, and noticed cameras and the amount of people involved.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nYaris confessed it was too much for a bridesmaid reveal and said he knew at that point that chances were coming to an end.\n\nHe said the executive people and the \"higher up\" people were there, and it was more than just a reveal - a bigger reveal.\n\nWhile preparing to unveil his picks for bridesmaid dresses, filming came to a halt when a runner axed the nuptials as soon as the rule-breaking was noticed.\n\nAnd if things couldn't get worse, the groom had spent almost \u00a312,000 out of the \u00a313,000 budget allocated for the occasion on flights, venue hire and dresses.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nThe 'legend' refused to answer any questions relating to his and Cherise's relationship status, or if they still plan to get married after the ordeal. Poor Chanise broke down on camera after the episode was cancelled.\n\nBut after all that happened, he is not embarrassed by the events that occurred, he's proud to have left a lasting legacy.\n\nHe said: \"It\u2019s something that\u2019s only ever happened once and it\u2019s going to go down in history.\"", "description": "Yaris and Charise made history on the show when their wedding was cancelled after they broke a major rule", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Channel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20416050.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EH_CHP_041019DONT-TELL-THE-BRIDE_1347JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
