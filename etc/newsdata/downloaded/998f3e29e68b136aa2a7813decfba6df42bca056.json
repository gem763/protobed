In an interview with People, Clinton claimed that she\u2019d \u201cheard a little bit about\u201d Biden\u2019s widely reported and well-documented history of inappropriate touching.\n\nClinton referred to the behavior as \u201ca little annoying habit,\u201d suggesting that a) the criticism of Biden\u2019s inappropriate touching is the result of the kind of overzealous media fixation faced by all presidential hopefuls, and that b) there are worse things happening in the White House:\n\n\u201cYou could take any person who sticks their little head above the parapet and says, \u2018I\u2019m going to run for president,\u2019 and find something that \u2026 a little annoying habit or other kind of behavior that people are going to pick apart and disagree with \u2026 We can pick apart anybody. I mean, that\u2019s a great spectator sport. But this man who\u2019s there in the Oval Office right now poses a clear and present danger to the future of the United States \u2026 So get over it.\u201d\n\nClinton suggested that rather than criticize Biden\u2019s behavior toward his female aides, critics, and supporters (behavior he claimed he would stop but somehow seems doggedly committed to), we should judge him and other candidates \u201con the totality of their lives and their service.\u201d\n\nThis approach to Biden\u2019s behavior is standard fare for his supporters, who generally believe that he\u2019s the only candidate who stands a chance against Donald Trump (this in spite of Biden\u2019s unambitious platform, which seems to begin and end with his experience as Obama\u2019s veep). And while it\u2019s true that candidates face extreme public scrutiny, Clinton\u2019s dismissal of Biden\u2019s behavior \u2014 and the proposition that it\u2019s a nonfactor because Trump is worse \u2014 is insufficient. Biden should be held accountable, like any other candidate; it\u2019s a (disappointing) miscalculation on Clinton\u2019s part to wave him through with a thumbs-up.", "description": "In a recent interview, Hillary Clinton called Joe Biden\u2019s inappropriate behavior toward women \u201ca little annoying habit.\u201d", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/30/30-hilary-clinton-joe-biden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
