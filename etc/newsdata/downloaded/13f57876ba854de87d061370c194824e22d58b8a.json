(AP Photo/Francois Mori, File)\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the World Trade Organization\u2019s ruling over EU\u2019s Airbus subsidies (all times local):\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nGouda cheese, single-malt whiskey and large aircraft are among the European imports the Trump administration plans to hit with tariffs after receiving the go-ahead Wednesday from the World Trade Organization in a case involving illegal European Union subsidies for the aircraft giant Airbus.\n\nThe targeted imports are worth $7.5 billion _ the full amount the WTO authorized.\n\nThe tariffs, to take effect Oct. 18, will be 10% for EU aircraft and 25% for everything else.\n\n\u201cFor years, Europe has been providing massive subsidies to Airbus that have seriously injured the U.S. aerospace industry and our workers,\u2019\u2019 U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.\n\n___\n\n10:00 p.m.\n\nThe Trump administration says it plans to impose tariffs on goods from the European Union on Oct. 18 after receiving a green light Wednesday from the World Trade Organization in a case involving EU subsidies to Airbus.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is expected to publish a target list of EU goods to be affected later Wednesday or Thursday. But a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration plans to hit EU aircraft with 10% import taxes and other products with 25% tariffs.\n\nEarlier, the administration published a list of potential targets that had included wine, cheese, olives and whiskey.\n\n___\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nBoeing says Europe can avoid up to $7.5 billion pf U.S. tariffs authorized by the World Trade Organization by bringing European aircraft manufacturer Airbus into compliance with WTO rules.\n\nThe American plane-maker said in a statement that the prospect of tariffs has only arisen because Airbus \u201chas refused for years to comply with WTO rulings.\u201d\n\nIt said Airbus\u2019s \u201cnon-compliance will negatively impact European Member States, industries, and businesses completely unrelated to Airbus\u2019s actions, as well as Airbus\u2019s airline customers.\u201d\n\nHowever, Boeing said that \u201ceven today, Airbus could still completely avoid these tariffs by coming into full compliance with its obligations. We hope it will finally do that.\u201d\n\n___\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says the World Trade Organization\u2019s ruling allowing Washington to take the punitive action over the illegal EU aid to Airbus will be a burden for the aircraft maker.\n\nThe WTO ruling earlier cleared the U.S. to impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion worth of goods from the European Union over EU subsidies for Airbus.\n\nMerkel told reporters in Berlin that \u201cwe have lost a matter under WTO law.\u201d The German chancellor has been one of the strongest defenders of WTO rules, even as the EU has suffered a defeat in its battle with the U.S. over Airbus aid.\n\nMerkel said \u201cthis means it\u2019s not some sort of arbitrary question but a verdict according to international law that now weighs on Airbus, one must sadly say.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cwe have to see how the Americans will react now.\u201d\n\n___\n\n4:20 p.m.\n\nBoeing competitor Airbus says the Trump administration would only hurt the United States if it slaps tariffs on the EU over its illegal financial support to the European aircraft manufacturer.\n\nAirbus CEO Guillaume Faury said following the World Trade Organization\u2019s ruling that the Trump administration can slap up to $7.5 billion-worth of tariffs on EU products would have a \u201cnegative impact\u201d on U.S. airlines as well as U.S. jobs, suppliers, and air travelers.\n\nHe says \u201cthe entire global industry will be harmed.\u201d\n\nFaury says \u201cclose to 40%\u201d of Airbus\u2019 aircraft-related procurement comes from U.S. suppliers, supporting \u201c275,000 American jobs in 40 states through spending that has totaled $50 billion in the last three years alone.\u201d\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s top trade official says the bloc would prefer to reach a settlement with the United States and avoid a tariff war over aircraft subsidies but that it will respond should President Donald Trump impose new duties on EU products.\n\nAfter the World Trade Organization cleared Trump to take action over illegal EU subsidies to plane-maker Airbus, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said \u201cour readiness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged.\u201d\n\nBut Malmstrom warned that \u201cif the U.S. decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Gouda cheese, single-malt whiskey and large aircraft are among the European imports the Trump administration plans to hit with tariffs after receiving the go-ahead Wednesday from the World Trade Organization in a case involving illegal European Union subsidies for the aircraft giant Airbus.
