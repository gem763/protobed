Bernie Sanders speaks alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during a press conference to introduce college affordability legislation outside the US Capitol in Washington, DC, June 24, 2019. More\n\nSaul Loeb/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign as he was hospitalized in Nevada following a heart attack.\n\nBut the freshman congresswoman was torn for months between her allegiance to Sanders' political revolution and her respect for Sen. Elizabeth Warren's achievements in Washington.\n\nSanders invited Ocasio-Cortez to Burlington, VT last month to ask for her \"strategic guidance,\" Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir told Insider. That was the turning point for the congresswoman.\n\nThree days later, Sanders had a heart attack. So Ocasio-Cortez decided to speed up her timeline.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWhen Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked during last Tuesday's Democratic debate how he can reassure voters he's physically prepared for the presidency, he touted his upcoming rally in Queens and a \"special guest\" who'd be joining him there.\n\nIn the closing minutes of the debate, news broke of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's imminent endorsement, along with expected endorsements from her fellow freshman lawmakers, Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.\n\nWith the support of three-fourths of the so-called \"Squad,\" the Sanders campaign heads into the final stage of the primary season riding a wave of youthful progressivism that could be key to snagging the nomination. But this wasn't always a certainty.\n\nWhen Sanders announced his 2020 presidential bid last February, Ocasio-Cortez hadn't yet decided if she'd endorse him.\n\nEven after volunteering for Sanders' campaign in 2016, the freshman congresswoman from New York was torn between her allegiance to his political revolution and her respect for Sen. Elizabeth Warren's achievements in Washington.\n\n\"She liked both candidates,\" a source close to Ocasio-Cortez told Insider. \"For months she was saying, 'Ah, I don't know. I like both.' She wasn't being coy, she wasn't being flip. She was just seriously saying, 'I don't know.'\"\n\nBut then Sanders invited Ocasio-Cortez to Burlington, VT, last month to ask for her \"strategic guidance,\" Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir told Insider.\n\nA previously unreported dinner on September 27 and a breakfast at a local diner with Sanders the next morning convinced the Bronx native that she'd eventually go all-in for her fellow democratic socialist.\n\nRead more: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement of Bernie Sanders is a huge win for him and a way for her to hit back at the Democratic Party\n\n\"From there things kind of took off,\" Shakir said. \"We had a lot of private conversations about the vision of how to win.\"\n\nThen, three days later, Sanders had a heart attack.\n\nPreparing to call him at the hospital to wish him well, Ocasio-Cortez decided she wanted to give his campaign a real shot in the arm.\n\n\"Her reaction was that this is ... when he needs an injection of energy in the campaign and she thought, 'If I have any capacity to do that, I should try,'\" the person close to her said.\n\n\"It took an incredible amount of courage on her part to call in that moment and lend support,\" Shakir said.\n\nAfter that, the two teams decided to unveil Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement at a rally in Queens on Saturday titled \"Bernie's Back.\"\n\nShakir said the Sanders team worked with Ocasio-Cortez and Omar to pick the most strategic moment for a boost.\n\n\"We're at quarter four of the year and quarter four of the fundraising cycle and this is when I think you want to be cresting,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it's paying off for the campaign. \"It is certainly putting wind at our backs at the right time in the campaign.\"\n\nThe source close to the campaign said they expect Ocasio-Cortez to go out on the campaign trail for Sanders in several early primary states and Super Tuesday states, including California. Shakir said his team is working with the congresswoman to organize a campaign event in Iowa in \"the near future.\"\n\nWhile Tlaib hasn't announced her endorsement yet, Shakir said Sanders is planning to visit the Michigan lawmaker in Detroit later this month for events that will focus on affordable housing issues.", "description": "AOC was torn between her longstanding allegiance to Sanders' political revolution and Sen.
