Ron DeSantis has ordered his political committee to turn over $50,000 to the federal government, money his campaign received last year from a shell corporation that is now at the heart of an indictment against two foreign-born associates of Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nGlobal Energy Producers LLC donated the money to the DeSantis campaign weeks before he won the Republican primary for governor. Campaign finance records show the donation came a day before Trump gave DeSantis a \u201cfull endorsement\u201d in his run against GOP establishment favorite Adam Putnam.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA federal indictment made public today accuses Global Energy of being a front group to mask the source of campaign donations. The FBI on Wednesday arrested Lev Parnas, which the indictment identifies as a Ukrainian-born American, and and Igor Fruman, who was born in Belarus and became an American citizen.\n\nDeSantis spokesperson Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9 called the Global Energy allegations \u201ctroubling.\"\n\n\"Governor DeSantis is directing the political action committee to return the money to the federal government,\u201d she said in a written statement.\n\nEarlier in the day, when the arrests of Parnas and Fruman first became public, Ferr\u00e9 said the governor \"does not have a relationship with these individuals nor has he had a one-on-one meeting with them. They may have attended some political events in 2018. Of course, the governor does not condone any illegal activities.\"\n\nThe Miami Herald reported this week that Parnas was a host for two DeSantis fundraisers last year. The newspaper described one as a small event held at a \u201cSouth Florida residence with fewer than 30 people attending, including the governor. The other gathering was headlined by Donald Trump Jr.\u201d", "description": "DeSantis spokesperson Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9 called the allegations \u201ctroubling.\"<br />", "authors": ["Gary Fineout"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a%20-%20desantis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
