The whistle-blower is now the \u201c#FakeWhistleblower\u201d whom he wants to identify and \u201cinterview.\u201d Anyone who spoke with the whistle-blower is \u201cclose to a spy,\u201d and Trump said: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nHe has suggested that Adam Schiff is criminal and even treasonous. He has called the impeachment inquiry a \u201ccoup.\u201d And, he has quoted someone who said that removing him from office \u201cwill cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\nThis will not end well. There is nothing Trump hates and fears more than being publicly chastised and embarrassed. He has always believed that he could control the narrative even if he couldn\u2019t control the facts. Facts don\u2019t really matter to the man.\n\nBut the march toward impeachment is beyond his control. He can\u2019t bully his way out of it. He can\u2019t lie his way out of it. It is happening. If he obstructs in any way it could only add to eventual articles of impeachment. The walls are closing in on him; his options to avoid are nearly nil.\n\nThe presidency has many powers, awesome powers, but Congress also has powers, and impeachment is one of them. Trump is likely to become only the third president to be impeached and the first to be impeached over his dealings with a foreign government, one of the things the framers of the Constitution feared most.", "description": "He will do and say whatever he can to avoid impeachment.", "authors": ["Charles M.
