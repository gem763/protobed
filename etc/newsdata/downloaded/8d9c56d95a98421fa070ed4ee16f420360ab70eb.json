Mike Folmer (R) in 2017. (Marc Levy/AP)\n\nPennsylvania state Sen. Mike Folmer has resigned after being charged with possession of child pornography on Tuesday night. Authorities said they discovered images of child pornography on his cellphone.\n\nThe Patriot-News reported that the charges against Folmer (R), 63, include sexual abuse of children, possession of child pornography and criminal use of a communication facility.\n\nThe married grandfather of seven was charged as the result of a tip that the blogging site Tumblr had found that a user had uploaded an image of child pornography using its application, officials said. They said the tip led investigators to Folmer\u2019s home in Lebanon, Pa., where they executed a search warrant and found child pornography images on his cellphone.\n\nFolmer told authorities that he received child pornography images through his Tumblr blog and that he was experiencing \u201csome personal problems,\u201d according to the Patriot-News\u2019s review of charging documents.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Pennsylvania Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R) and Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R) announced Folmer\u2019s retirement.\n\n\u201cWe are sickened and disturbed by the charges brought against Mike Folmer yesterday,\u201d the Senate leaders said in a statement, according to the Patriot-News. \u201cWe have reviewed the criminal complaint and spoke with Mike Folmer early this morning to insist on his resignation from the Senate. We are in receipt of his letter of resignation and the 48th Senatorial District seat is now vacant.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) announced the charges Tuesday night. By Wednesday morning, Folmer\u2019s name had already been removed from the Pennsylvania Senate State Government Committee\u2019s website, and his colleagues on both sides of the aisle were condemning his alleged actions and calling for him to resign.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf (D) called Wednesday morning for Folmer\u2019s immediate resignation, according to the Patriot-News.\n\n\u201cWe elect leaders to serve as a voice for those who do not have the ability to advocate for their own needs, demanding that they will protect our children, families, and communities,\u201d Wolf said in a statement to the news outlet. \u201cThe charges against Senator Folmer are disgusting and beyond comprehension, and show he has taken advantage of the trust and privilege afforded by the people of Pennsylvania. He should immediately resign.\u201d\n\nBefore Folmer\u2019s resignation, Scarnati and Corman issued a joint statement Tuesday night announcing Folmer\u2019s immediate removal from his post as chairman of the Senate State Government Committee. \u201cFurther action in response to these charges will be taken by Senate Leadership in the coming days,\u201d they said.\n\nFolmer did not respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday morning.\n\nThe state senator was first elected in 2006, when he defeated Sen. David Brightbill in the GOP primary \u2014 a win that was spurred by anger over 2005 legislative pay raises, according to the Patriot-News.\n\nFolmer became known as \u201cMarijuana Mike\u201d for his role in pushing the governor\u2019s medical marijuana legislation, which was signed in 2016.\n\nRead more:\n\nMd.\u2019s top court upholds child pornography charge against teen who texted friends a video of herself\n\nHe forgot his phone on the bus and got busted with child porn, officials say.
