She remained conscious during the caesarean section and is being kept in the ICU.\n\nHer husband, Huang Heping, 68, was there to greet her as she was wheeled out of surgery in front of local media.\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\nThe new dad revealed that their son and daughter, the oldest of whom is 40, had cut ties with them over their decision to keep the girl who they have chosen to name Tianci - Mandarin for \u2018heaven-sent.\n\nMr Huang, a lawyer, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve named her Tianci, because she was a gift from god.\n\n\"I hope she likes her name in the future.\u201d\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\nHe suggested the high-risk pregnancy was not planned, saying: \u201cHad we really wanted another child, we\u2019d have done so much earlier.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have waited until she was so old. It was an accident.\u201d\n\nOf the couple\u2019s several grandchildren, their oldest granddaughter is now 18 and starting university.\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\nIt means Tianci\u2019s niece is 18 years her senior, and her sister is 40 years older too.\n\nMs Tian, who worked as a nurse in the same hospital\u2019s paediatrics ward, reportedly admitted to local media she would not choose to keep the child if she was given a second opportunity.\n\nShe was quoted as saying: \u201cIt was painful, far too painful. It hurt so much, I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open.\u201d\n\nOn the prospect of passing away before her newborn daughter comes of age, she added: \u201cWe have to raise her to adulthood at all costs. We\u2019re going to try live to 110.\u201d\n\nThe new mum said she would not rely on her children or grandchildren to help, and would raise the girl using her and her husband\u2019s pension.\n\nDoctor Wang, who was consulting from Jinan Maternity and Child Care Hospital in the provincial capital, told local media shortly after stepping out of surgery: \u201cThe operation went very smoothly.\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\n\u201cTwo problems arose during surgery, but we had foreseen them, and they weren\u2019t very serious.\n\n\u201cThey were dealt with quickly, and both mother and child are safe. To conceive naturally and successfully carry the pregnancy to term at 67 - I\u2019ve not seen a case like that.\u201d\n\nDoctor Wang did not say whether the hospital was able to verify the couple\u2019s claim that the girl was naturally conceived.\n\nBut if their claim is true, it would make Ms Tian the oldest woman to conceive naturally in China.\n\nAccording to reports, she is already China\u2019s oldest new mother after overtaking a 64-year-old woman who gave birth to a baby boy in 2016 in Changchun, capital of north-eastern Jilin Province.\n\nZaozhuang Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital\u2019s records show that Ms Tian first discovered she was pregnant during an examination in Beijing on 6th April this year.\n\n(Image: AsiaWire)\n\nDespite recommendations that she not see out the pregnancy, Ms Tian felt she was \u201cphysically capable\u201d of bearing and delivering the child.\n\nShe registered herself in the neonatal unit on 20th May, and was categorised as high risk.\n\nAt 34 weeks, doctors recommended a C-section due to her fluctuating blood pressure and blood sugar levels, but Ms Tian declined.\n\nThe cesarean was performed at just over 36 weeks into her pregnancy, with the child at late preterm, the hospital said.", "description": "Tian Ying welcomes her \"gift from god\" after her daughter was born via a C-section in East China this weekend", "authors": ["John Feng", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Asiawire"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742804.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-AsiaWire-GrandmotherMum-04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
