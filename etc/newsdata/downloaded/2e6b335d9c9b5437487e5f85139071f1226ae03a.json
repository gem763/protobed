They are so pumped to meet their President @realDonaldTrump.\n\nSuch America-loving energy\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udea8 pic.twitter.com/m3OVwAgCx7 \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 4, 2019\n\nOnce there, President Donald Trump invigorated the crowd when he came out to speak, sparking lots of cheers and chant of \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d\n\nYou can see more of the event here.\n\nHere\u2019s the full speech, released by the White House.\n\nTrump spoke on how we are all connected \u201cin the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans\u201d and how the young leaders visiting at the White House were standing up for America, speaking up for the values and principles that make us great.\n\nHe also praised them for standing up against censorship and control, saying, \u201cYou stand right up to those forces in our country that demand conformity and control. You refuse to be censored, you refuse to be silenced, and you will never back down.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever back down,\u201d he encouraged the young leaders.\n\nWhile there were a lot of policy discussions and serious talk at the event, there also were fun moments.\n\nThere was this moment when one of the participants \u2013 who tweets indicate is Mike Luso, CEO and cofounder of Scriberr News \u2013 asked the president to sign the infamous erroneous Newsweek magazine cover that declared Hillary Clinton \u201cMadam President.\u201d Trump, ever the one to have sense of humor, signed it right on Hillary\u2019s face.\n\n\ud83d\udd25HOLY, WOW \ud83d\udd25 A Young Black Leader at our @TPUSA White House trip asked @realDonaldTrump to sign the Infamous misprint of Newsweek\u2019s election edition erroneously featuring \u201cMadam President\u201d\n\nThe President winked and signed it RIGHT on @HillaryClinton\u2019s face.

But of course she was defeated because Trump was able to reach out to folks with a positive message that Clinton did not have.\n\nIt\u2019s likely they\u2019re going to be caught off-guard again in 2020, if the enthusiasm of the folks at the summit is any indication.", "description": "Trump Trolls Hillary on Infamous Magazine Cover at Young Black Leadership Summit", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Sister Toldjah", "Alex Parker", "Stu Cvrk", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-05-at-6.33.43-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
