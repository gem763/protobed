The Chinese Basketball Association severed its ties with the Rockets organization, even though Morey deleted the tweet and apologized for causing offense.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement on Sunday that brought harsh criticism from people in the United States that believed the NBA was bowing to Chinese censorship. Silver issued another, stronger statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"I recognize our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for,\" Silver said on Tuesday.\"We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.\"\n\n\"Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so,\" Silver continued. \"It is inevitable that people around the world \u2014 including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\"\n\nChinese state television has canceled broadcasts of the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets game scheduled to be played later this week. It is reviewing its partnership with the NBA and all future programming with the American professional basketball league.", "description": "ESPN leadership has barred sports pundits from discussing China and Hong Kong's relationship on the network while the NBA conducts damage control over a Houston Rockets official praising Hong Kongers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/027b121/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Ff7%2F5f%2F6d1e48af4b4db65da013113a322f%2Fadam-silver.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
