This time, I think, I\u2019m going to beat it. Enemy gets me with a chainsaw in the back. Nope.\n\nTry again. This time? Shot with a missile from afar.\n\nDeep breath. It\u2019s going to all work out this time.\n\nBut then it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThat was me repeatedly failing the same fight in Gears 5 on Saturday, making all the mental mistakes that happen when I\u2019m smashing into a game level that won\u2019t give.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there: We hit a hard part in a game and just refuse to give up. Lower the difficulty? Perish the thought. Spend an hour or more getting increasingly stressed and arguing with ourselves about when to finally change a strategy that so clearly isn\u2019t working? What saves us from these moments and from ourselves?\n\nOn Saturday, for me, it was a merciful glitch, and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m ok with that.\n\nThe Gears 5 fight made me happy before it stressed me out. It occurs late in the new Xbox One and PC game\u2019s second act. I\u2019m playing as Kait Diaz, hauling a machine gun and a huge staff with me as Kait, her buddy Del and their robot helper Jack scramble down to a frozen lakebed below a damaged bridge and shoot past a group of growling humanoid enemies.\n\nThe encounter\u2019s wonderful twist is that you can just shoot the ice below your enemies\u2019 feet to make it crack and drown them. The ice re-freezes so you can shatter it beneath the feet of whoever walks on it next. Great!\n\nThe first fight on the lake went fine. I reached a platform on the far side of the frozen lake bed. I then discovered I\u2019d need to defend it as more enemies approached from across the ice. This defence occupied the next 70 minutes of my playthrough. I thought the fight would be quick, and I really needed it to be. It was late at night. My wife had gone to bed. My daughter had gone to sleep with a fever. I\u2019d just get through this thing.\n\nI made Kait crouch behind a wall. Here came the enemies \u2014 first these little hopping guys, some of whom turned into suicide bombers. Pop this one off here, shoot the ice under that one\u2026 get that bomb one to blow up on the ice so that the lake swallows two of his buddies, too. Damn, I\u2019m good. Then come the slower, stronger enemies. Crack the ice here. Crack it there. Bigger bad guy coming up, but he\u2019s shielded. Aim at the ice at his feet and then\u2026 no. He got me.\n\nRestart.\n\nEvery time I tried this fight I was sure I was about to win it. Sometimes I\u2019d get further, all the way to what I assumed was the final rush of shielded enemies. Sometimes I\u2019d die early from the hopping bomber guys. The enemies always came in the same pattern. Too often, I responded with the same pattern, stubbornly clinging to tactics that had failed and failed some more.\n\nTwo steps forward, one step back, and finally I was surviving long to nearly clear the fight.\n\nMy final run felt magical. I was shooting the ice in all the right spots, sending all the baddest enemies to their very cold baths. I was doing great. I\u2019d learned. Witness me, the breathing exhibition of a human being\u2019s ability to improve through repetition. I had solved it all!\n\nThe only catch was that I didn\u2019t hear a guitar riff. That was odd. Gears games have always done this thing where you\u2019ll hear a guitar chord once you\u2019ve cleared an enemy battle and you\u2019re out of danger. I\u2019d fought the fight. I\u2019d slayed the bad guys. There was no chord.\n\nThen I noticed it. Way in the back, mostly obscured by a pillar. Was that one of those cannon-wielding enemies that had stopped so many of my nearly successful runs? Come to think of it, it did seem like there was one less in this last fight. There he was, walking but staying in place, like someone warming up on a treadmill at the gym. Oh. That\u2019s why I had finally cleared this fight. It had glitched.\n\nI walked up to that broken enemy and shot a drone that was shielding him. That seemed to free him. I backed up, shot the ice, drowned him and heard the guitar riff.\n\nBriefly, I felt bad about this. It was a cheap win.\n\nThen I saw the time. I thought about my daughter and how I\u2019d probably need to be up soon if she woke up feverish (she would) and that I\u2019d need to help her back to sleep (I would). So I took my cheap win, turned off the game and called it a night.\n\nThe next night, I hit another tough fight and a tougher one after that. I should probably lower the difficulty of this game, huh?
