It affected my relationship with my husband, with friends.\n\n\"It really was rock bottom of my entire career. But somehow, you see light at the end of the tunnel, and I can honestly say I'm having more fun now playing than I ever have in my career. I think I just learned a lot throughout it.\n\n\"There's no denying it, I deserved to be on that field that whole World Cup, but I wasn't. And I think I've grown as a person, as a player. It sucked. It absolutely sucked.\"\n\n(Image: FIFA via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, she said she was happy for her team-mates such as Golden Boot winner Megan Rapinoe, adding: \"I was super happy for my teammates and happy for Megan, who put the team on her back, and for several other players.\n\n\"It was great to see, and I'm happy that I could still have been a part of it.\"\n\nAnd the Sky Blue FC midfielder has not given up on continuing her international career after head coach Jill Ellis departed, saying she hopes to be able to play in next year's Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"I\u2019m waiting on a new coach to be announced and if that coach would like to see me in the Olympic plans then I\u2019m all for it,\" she said.", "description": "Midfielder was unhappy at reduced role and said it affected her relationships with husband and friends", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters", "Fifa Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588798.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-PHOTO-Womens-World-Cup-Quarter-Finals-United-States-Training.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
