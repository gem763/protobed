Oh, and $1.6 million in fees Blue Sky kept for itself. Despite promising that \u201call annual fees paid upfront will be refunded\u201d if it exited the investment before 2020, Blue Sky tipped undrawn fund monies into a later bridge (read: desperation) funding round \u2013 by which point shrewder VC had turned off the taps. Its investors got no refund. Class act?\n\nShoes of Prey was just one of many unviable enterprises through which Stead set fire to other people\u2019s money (OPM). There was the $11.5 million Blue Sky dusted on \u201chip cafeteria chain\u201d Thr1ve, defunct social media platform Hey Let\u2019s and the $25 million it poured into Vinomofo, whose own collision with reality is surely imminent. Her previous employer, CM Capital Investments, was liquidated in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe thing that matters, and the only thing that will matter in the end, [is] whether I did the right thing, whether we took care of our shareholders or investors, and whether we were able to return capital to them in the way we hoped,\u201d Stead told a start-up blog in November. \u201cWere we good people and did we make good decisions?\u201d Herein the answers: no, no, no, arguable and no.\n\nYet the South Australian government is now seeking a new manager of its SA Venture Capital Fund, its precondition being that the successful provider continues to employ Stead. Because continuity. It\u2019s downright embarrassing, even by Adelaide\u2019s basement-low standards. Premier Steven Marshall wants the world to know his long mendicant state is finally open for business. With this scandalous directive, he only leaves it open to ridicule.\n\nWith his taxpayers\u2019 funds, what big idea will Stead co-invest in next? A prototype DVD rewinder? Or perhaps motorised ice-cream cones?\n\nMarshall could be a national hero by paying Stead $1 million each year not to \u2018invest\u2019 OPM. In her case, it\u2019s nothing ventured, nothing lost.", "description": "Shoes of Prey founder Jodie Fox exhibits about as much shame at losing other people's money as her Blue Sky buddy Elaine Stead.
