Gun control gained renewed attention in the wake of the shootings last month in Dayton and El Paso, Texas, where more than 30 people were killed in the two cities.\n\nMs. Whaley said a proposal from Rep. David Cicilline, Rhode Island Democrat, to ban certain military-style weapons is \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d and \u201cshould move forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat bill would affect the Dayton shooting, frankly, and so it would make a great difference so there won\u2019t be cities like Dayton that have experienced this kind of trauma,\u201d she said.\n\nA gunman armed with AR-15-style pistol shot and killed nine people and wounded dozens of others at a popular nightclub area of Dayton last month.\n\nMs. Whaley also said the police officers who were nearby and ran toward the shooting \u201csaved countless lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if we did not have, as I like to say, six good guys with guns, the amount of damage and death that would have happened could have been in the hundreds,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the wake of the two shootings, though, some say that simply banning the manufacture and sale of military-style, semiautomatic firearms isn\u2019t enough and that the federal government should institute an Australian-style buyback scheme.\n\n\u201cIf these weapons are dangerous in the future, wouldn\u2019t you agree that they\u2019re dangerous now and that there has to be some way to protect people now from ever having their kids shot in school, their parent shot in a church, their sister shot at a concert, from one of these weapons?\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell, California Democrat and a former 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke has aggressively pushed a mandatory buyback scheme on the presidential campaign trail and vowed in the last debate to \u201ctake\u201d popular semiautomatic rifles, such as the AR-15, away from owners.\n\nBut David Chipman, a former federal agent who is now a senior adviser to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords\u2019 gun control group, suggested to lawmakers Wednesday that using the existing National Firearms Act to impose new regulations on the weapons would be a better route.\n\n\u201cI think that we should be looking to America, not Australia, for solutions,\u201d Mr. Chipman said. \u201cThe NFA was passed at a time where we had a similar problem so I would suggest that it\u2019s a balance that would honor the rights of people who have these guns to keep them if they were properly regulated.\u201d\n\nSeveral witnesses, though, said banning the weapons wouldn\u2019t necessarily do much to reduce the likelihood of mass shootings and that the new regulations could turn otherwise law-abiding Americans into criminals overnight.\n\n\u201cWe are law-abiding, responsible gun owners and please don\u2019t legislate the 150 million people just like me into being criminals,\u201d said Dianna Muller, founder of the D.C. Project.\n\nShe pointed to the Trump administration\u2019s recent ban on bump stock devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to mimic the rate of machine gunfire as a recent example.\n\n\u201cI was a bump stock owner, and I had to make a decision: do I become a felon or do I comply?\u201d she said. \u201cI will not comply with the assault weapons ban.\u201d\n\nCongress had passed an assault weapons ban in 1994, but it lapsed in 2004.\n\nDespite the renewed attention on the gun issue, a new ban on such weapons is on the outer edge of what could reasonably be expected to pass Congress in the near future.\n\nCongressional Democrats have instead urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take up House-passed legislation that would expand federal background checks to cover more gun sales and extend the time dealers have to wait to hear back from the FBI before proceeding with a sale.\n\nBut Mr. McConnell has said he\u2019s waiting for more specifics on what President Trump would support.\n\nMr. Trump said he talked about guns with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, but that Mrs. Pelosi isn\u2019t interested in pursuing the issue as House Democrats formalize their impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi is not interested in guns, in gun protection, in gun safety,\u201d Mr. Trump said Wednesday while in New York at a United Nations meeting. \u201cShe\u2019s been taken over by the radical left.\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Pelosi, who joined gun control advocates at a rally near the Capitol on Wednesday, had expressed hope that she could continue to work with the president on legislation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what he told me,\u201d she said about the notion that the impeachment inquiry destroyed any chance at legislation, according to Reuters.\n\nAttorney General William Barr recently floated a proposal to expand background checks to cover more commercial sales, along the lines of what GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia proposed several years ago.\n\nBut conservatives objected and the White House quickly disowned the document.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
