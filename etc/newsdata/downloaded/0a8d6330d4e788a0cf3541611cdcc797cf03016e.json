At the time of the New Year\u2019s Eve party, Trump was reportedly dating Melania Knauss, who he would later marry, and engaging in what the book called \u201ca wave of allegedly unwanted touching.\u201d\n\nAfter midnight, Johnson said she was preparing to return home with her ailing husband and a relative. She went to the bathroom, and as she walked out, she said that Trump pulled her behind a tapestry.\n\n\u201cI was so scared because of who he was. I didn\u2019t have a say in the matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a tall girl and I had six-inch heels on, and I still remember looking up at him. And he\u2019s strong, and he just kissed me,\u201d she told the authors of the book, Barry Levine and Monique El-Faizy. \u201cI was so scared because of who he was... I don\u2019t even know where it came from. I didn\u2019t have a say in the matter.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Johnson said she stood next to Trump while he said goodbye to a few leaving guests. \u201cI was afraid to say what had happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how it happened.\u201d\n\nREAD: Trump was just accused of sexual assault by the journalist E. Jean Carroll\n\nAfter the alleged incident, Trump repeatedly called Johnson, offering to fly her to New York for the day. She kept turning him down, and eventually, the calls stopped. Johnson told her relative about the incident, as well as a friend; the authors of the book corroborated Johnson\u2019s account with her friend.\n\nShe was afraid to tell anybody what had happened, for fear of being told that she must have \u201casked for it\u201d in some way. But when she heard the \u201cAccess Hollywood tape,\u201d Johnson said she was shocked.\n\n\u201cWhen he says that thing, \u2018Grab them in the pussy,\u2019 that hits me hard because when he grabbed me and pulled me into the tapestry, that\u2019s where he grabbed me \u2014 he grabbed me there in my front and pulled me in,\u201d she said.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately reply to a VICE News request for comment, but Trump has previously denied all sexual impropriety. So far, more than a dozen women have said that he acted inappropriately with them.\n\nCover: American real estate developer Donald Trump accepts a drink during a New Year's Eve party at the Mar-a-Lago estate, Palm Beach, Florida, December 31, 2002.
