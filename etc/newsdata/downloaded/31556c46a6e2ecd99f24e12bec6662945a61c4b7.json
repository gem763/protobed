We want to make Okami sequel and fans are looking forward to it too. You guys want to see Kamiya\u2019s Okami again, right, everyone? I want to work on it too! \u5927\u795e\u3092\u307e\u305f\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u3067\u3059\u3002\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a@CapcomUSA_ @OKAMI_CAP pic.twitter.com/bLwuGnTew1 \u2014 Ikumi Nakamura (@nakamura193) October 18, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNakamura was at TangoGameWorks for nine years but previous to that she worked at Platinum as a concept designer on Bayonetta and before that worked on\u2026 Okami.\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t help us work out whether this is a gag or not, although Kamiya has been talking about making a sequel to the game for years.\n\nIn fact, he hinted at exactly that to us a few years back at E3, although obviously nothing ever came of it \u2013 as far as we know.\n\nKamiya (and presumably Nakamura) has lots of friends at Capcom though and it just so happens that today we ran a story about Capcom talking about reviving dormant franchises.\n\nOkami was never a major hit, despite multiple remasters, and there was already a sequel on DS \u2013 that had nothing to do with the original team \u2013 but as one of the best Zelda-seque action adventures ever made we\u2019d love to see it get a proper follow-up, and it\u2019s obvious Kamiya would too.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Capcom to \u2018awaken dormant IPs\u2019 after \u2018indisputable\u2019 success of Devil May Cry 5\n\nMORE: Okami HD Switch review \u2013 definitive edition\n\nMORE: Hideki Kamiya hints at Okami 2 and Bayonetta 3", "description": "Hideki Kamiya may finally be getting his chance to make a sequel to Capcom classic Okami, unless he\u2019s making a particularly cruel joke.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/okami_wp8_1920_1571434776.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
