(York Regional Police)\n\n'I am truly at a loss': chief\n\nBut despite that tragedy capturing national attention and the deaths and injuries that have followed in the years since, police say the problem of impaired driving appears to be on the rise in York Region, with approximately 15 to 30 arrests made each week.\n\n\"I am truly at a loss to how drivers continue to make the stupid and dangerous decision to drive while impaired, either by alcohol or drugs,\" said Chief Eric Joliffe in a news release.\n\nThis past Wednesday, police say they received a 911 call from a school in Vaughan about a 38-year-old man who attempted to pick up his children. Staff at the school didn't allow the children to get into the vehicle because the man appeared to be drunk.\n\nHe drove away before police found him and his vehicle a short time later at his home, and was arrested for impaired driving, blowing twice the legal blood alcohol limit.\n\nIn an effort to dissuade imapired drivers from getting behind the wheel, police opted to release a recording of the man under arrest in the back of the police vehicle.\n\n\"My two-year-old just saw me going away with a cruiser,\" the man says in the video.\n\nMoments later, his voice breaking, he adds, \"I don't care if I gotta stay in there for three days, can you please just take care of my family?\"\n\n\"The fact that someone was willing to risk the lives of their children and everybody else on our road is just completely shocking,\" Const. Andy Pattenden told CBC News.\n\nDrunk driving on the rise in region\n\n\"You would think with all the publicity and all the talk and all the education about the dangerous of impaired driving and the fact that people have seen this tragedy unfold on television everywhere, that the numbers would go down.\"\n\nSince the Neville-Lake crash in 2015, the number of impaired-related criminal charges has risen each year. Police say there were 1,636 in 2016, 1,649 in 2017 and 1,654 in 2018. In 2019 so far, there have already been 1,295 cases.\n\nIt's a problem that's doubly painful for Neville-Lake, given the timing of this most recent arrest, said Pattenden.\n\n\"Her wish is that everyone would stop driving impaired and that nobody would have to suffer the way she has suffered ... So the anniversary is very difficult for everybody that's been involved,\" he said.\n\n\"No, I don't believe that what happened to my family was so that the universe could learn some valuable lessons,\" Neville-Lake wrote in her post.\n\n\"No, I don't believe that my children were the sacrifice so that you would stop drinking or doing drugs. No, I don't believe that it is only up to me to make the world safer for our children.\"", "description": "Almost four years to the day after Jennifer Neville-Lake's\u00a0three children and father were killed by a drunk driver, police in York Region say they\u00a0arrested a father\u00a0who tried to pick up his children from school while intoxicated.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300918.1569618931!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/york-impaired.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
