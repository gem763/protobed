It allowed us to take the children's toys with us and have a home away from home.'\n\n'We had six magical days and then on our seventh day, irreversible tragedy hit us.'\n\nElber admitted she could have had no idea the disaster that would befall her family, saying: 'The day began as beautiful as all the others.'\n\nElber called her late husband Con her best friend, and said they had been 'living the dream' before his tragic death\n\nShe revealed: 'The little man used to love the bath, so we took him to the swimming pool for the first time. We went for our lunch and it was raining, so we were on our way to a play centre when tragedy struck.'\n\nMarek had written a four-page suicide note after splitting up from his wife, who alerted the police.\n\nWhen they spotted his vehicle, they turned on their siren and flashing lights.\n\nBut instead of stopping, witnesses said Marek sped on, veering across into the opposite carriageway and straight at the Twomeys\u2019 car making it \u2018impossible\u2019 for the family to avoid him.\n\nElber revealed she has now been able to forgive Marek Wojiechowski, 26, who killed himself and Elber's husband Con, 16-month-old son Ois\u00edn and her unborn child when he drove into their car\n\nWhile Elber's 16-month-old son Ois\u00edn died soon after the crash, her husband Con suffered fatal injuries and died ten months later in hospital.\n\nElber said she was thankful she did not remember anything from the crash, saying: 'I don\u2019t have any memory of it as I had a head injury. I\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t remember it.'\n\nAt first, she said she did not believe her husband was as badly injured as he was, saying: 'I strongly believed he would recover and I\u2019d have my best friend back.'\n\nElber was devastated by what had happened, but credited her 'remarkable' parents for 'rallying around' and helping her through the tragedy.\n\nMarek, who had left a suicide note at home for his wife, deliberately drove his car into oncoming traffic\n\nShe said it took her months to come to terms with what had happened, revealing: 'I remember the September after the crash, a friend was talking to me about prayer and he asked me, \"Do you pray for Marek?\"\n\n'I was highly hurt and cross. How could you expect me to pray for a man who destroyed my family?'\n\nShe went on: 'Two months later I found myself lighting a candle for him. [It was the ] first step on the road to finding a sense of peace.'\n\nElber said she had gone on to meet with Marek's widow, and called her 'a lovely lady.'\n\nElber said she had been devastated by the crash which 'destroyed' her family (pictured, Con with Ois\u00edn)\n\nShe said: 'I wanted her to know I didn\u2019t blame her. Husband and wives have arguments all the time, that doesn't mean that the other person is going to go out the door and do what Marek did.'\n\n'She was glad to meet me, and see that I didn't blame her. She was possibly afraid that I did blame her.'\n\nElber admitted she has no idea how she managed at first, saying: 'I look back now and wonder how I got out of bed.'\n\nShe said: 'I had married my best friend. We were living the dream.\n\nSince the crash, Elber has raised almost \u00a3168,000 for various charities through her own organisation Twomey Family Remorial (pictured, left)\n\n'I do think the man above sent a lot of good people into my life and helped me to find a good bit of positive out of my charity.'\n\nSince the tragedy, Elber has campaigned for police officers to receive specific training in suicide awareness and how to apprehend suicidal drivers.\n\nAnd in 2014, Devon and Cornwall police announced a change in their police pursuit policy, so that they now have 'advance training'.\n\nElber explained: 'They can't begin a pursuit unless they have this advance training. Now they know how to box a car in without any noise or anything - it's very professionally done and very safely done.'\n\nElber has campaigned for police officers to receive specific training in suicide awareness and how to apprehend suicidal drivers (pictured, centre)\n\nShe also raises money for various organisations through her charity Twomey Family Remorial, which has raised over \u00a3168,000 for charities over the past seven years.\n\nShe said: 'You learn to cope better. You learn to cope more. Their legacy is the police training, and we have the Twomey Family Remorial weekend every year.'\n\nElber added: 'Because I forgive Marek doesn't mean what he did was right. He destroyed my family.'\n\n'But if you're able to forgive someone, it allows you to do something good out of something dreadful.'", "description": "Elber Twomey, 43, from Cork, revealed she has forgiven Marek Wojiechowski, 26, who drove into her family's car and killed her husband Con, son Ois\u00edn and her unborn daughter in 2012.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20089070-0-image-a-2_1571843506762.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
