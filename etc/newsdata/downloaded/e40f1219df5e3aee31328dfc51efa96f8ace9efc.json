I\u2019d love to meet him, just to shake his hand and say 'Cheers' or 'Shukran'.\n\nAlso on rt.com Mo Salah poses with young fan who broke his nose trying to greet Liverpool star (PHOTOS)\n\nBird says that converting to Islam hasn't changed him or his personality in any dramatic way, but he says his 'heart is better' after abandoning the rituals of gambling and drinking which he said dominated his football supporting for years.\n\n\"I'm embarrassed to say this but my opinions on Islam used to be that the religion, the culture and the people were backward; that they didn\u2019t integrate and wanted to take over,\" he explains. \"I always looked at Muslims like the elephant in the room. I had a hatred of Muslims.\"\n\nHowever, Bird's prejudices melted away when he became friends with students from Arab countries while in university, where he undertook a course on Middle Eastern Studies.\n\n\"I was a typical white-boy student who went to a different city, would get absolutely hammered and lived the student life. My degree was the first time I learned about Islam in an academic way.\"\n\nBird says that he was given an assignment in which he was asked to study Salah's impact on western thoughts on Islam, and when he spoke to Egyptian students about the player's impact on their society he became immediately impressed.\n\n\"At university I interviewed Egyptian students and when they found out my research was about \u201cMohamed Salah, a gift from Allah\u201d \u2013 which is also another Liverpool song \u2013 they would talk to me for hours about how great he is and what he\u2019s done for their country. One million Egyptians spoiled their ballots and voted for him to be president last year.\n\n\"One of the Egyptians I talked to told me that Salah encompasses what being a Muslim is, following Islam correctly. He believed that Salah is making people love Muslims again.\n\n\"Salah showed me that you can be normal and a Muslim, if that\u2019s the right phrase. You can be yourself. He\u2019s a great player and is respected by the football community and his politics, his religion, don\u2019t matter \u2013 and to me that\u2019s what football can do.\"\n\nIt is a stance which Bird says that he is proud to hold and rejects his previous thoughts on the religion and its standing in western society.\n\nAlso on rt.com Man arrested on suspicion of posting racist Mo Salah tweet\n\n\"What would I say to the Ben of old? I\u2019d give him a smack, to be honest, and I\u2019d say: 'How dare you think like that about a people that are so diverse. You need to start talking to people. You need to start asking the questions.' We live in a multicultural, multifaith, multinational society.\n\n\"Now, I\u2019d say to Muslim kids: 'Don\u2019t be afraid to go to a football match.' I think that\u2019s an issue we have to look at from both sides. I was afraid of being segregated. I don\u2019t want to lose my mates because I look at them as brothers to me. Now I've got a fifth of the world\u2019s population as brothers and sisters.\n\n\"The community has to branch out, play football, go to football. It\u2019s up to us to realise that we\u2019re in this together. And the best spokesman for that could be Mohamed Salah.\"", "description": "An English football supporter has credited Liverpool forward Mo Salah for transitioning him from having anti-Islam sentiments to becoming a Muslim, after he said he was inspired by the Liverpool forward's character.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d974b9b85f54039c0340fff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
