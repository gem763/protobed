She was re-arrested just last year after police accused her of feigning mental illness.\n\nJudges ruled the prosecution had until Friday to appeal the decision, which would have Leifer live at her sister\u2019s house near Tel Aviv.\n\nManny Waks, founder of Kol V\u2019Oz, an Israel-based organisation against child sex abuse in the global Jewish community, said the decision was \u201can absolute travesty and continues to bring shame on the State of Israel\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf Leifer is genuinely unwell, she should be held in a medical facility or jail where she can be appropriately cared for until her extradition to Australia is approved,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nDassi Erlich, an Australian who has accused Leifer of abusing her, said the news had left her reeling and was a \u201cmassive betrayal of justice\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis blatant disregard for the wellbeing of the Israeli community is outstanding,\u201d she added.\n\nAnother alleged victim and Erlich\u2019s sister, Nicole Meyer, said: \u201cI am hurt by the State of Israel.\u201d\n\nLeifer\u2019s lawyer has denied all charges against her. His client left Israel in 2000 to run an ultra-Orthodox Jewish girls\u2019 school in Melbourne but returned in 2008 after students raised allegations.\n\nMalka Leifer: how the alleged abuser's trial became entangled in Israeli politics Read more\n\nMany of the delays have centred around whether Leifer, an Israeli citizen, has been mentally fit to stand trial or be extradited. Last year, videos taken by a private investigator and shared with the Guardian appeared to show her living a \u201cnormal, healthy\u201d life, and Israeli police re-arrested Leifer on suspicion of obstruction of justice.\n\nIf extradited, Leifer is expected to face charges including indecent assault and rape. The Jewish school that hired the principal was ordered in 2015 to pay more than $1.1m in compensatory damages.\n\nThe Israeli case has also been beset by suggestions of foul play. Israel\u2019s deputy health minister, Ya\u2019acov Litzman, who leads an ultra-Orthodox party, was accused of obstructing the extradition case. Israeli media have since reported he allegedly pressured doctors to falsify psychiatric evaluations that would deem Leifer unfit to face trial.\n\nLitzman\u2019s office has denied any wrongdoing.", "description": "Decision by Jerusalem court was a \u2018massive betrayal of justice\u2019, says alleged victim", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e07bc00cef48505ac8f38ed440d0b871546463/0_52_3519_2112/master/3519.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea9bca16998d28812b13c774dc54a95d"}
