Here's What to Know About Them", "language": "en", "text": "For the first time in the Nobel Prize for Literature\u2019s 118-year history, two authors were announced Thursday as recipients of the award for two different years: Austrian novelist and playwright Peter Handke and Polish author Olga Tokarczuk. (Handke received the Prize for 2019. Tokarczuk received the Prize for 2018.)\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel Prize for Literature had been cancelled in the wake of sexual assault allegations and significant resignations in 2017 that rocked the Swedish Academy administering the Nobel Prize.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the two central European authors.\n\nOlga Tokarczuk\n\nTokarczuk received the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature \u201cfor a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life,\u201d the Nobel Academy said.\n\nOlga Tokarczuk, awarded the 2018 #NobelPrize in Literature, never views reality as something stable or everlasting. She constructs her novels in a tension between cultural opposites; nature versus culture, reason versus madness, male versus female, home versus alienation. \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 10, 2019\n\nTokarczuk, 57, was born in 1962 in Sulech\u00f3w, Poland. She now lives in Wroc\u0142aw. She was immersed in literature from a young age. Her parents were teachers and her father was also a school librarian. In the library, \u201cshe read pretty much everything she could get hold of,\u201d the Academy says in a biography of the author.\n\nHer \u201creal breakthrough,\u201d it notes, was with her third novel, Primeval and Other Time \u2014 a family saga set in a mythical place. And what the Nobel Academy described as her \u201cmagnum opus\u201d to date was the historical novel, The Books of Jacob \u2014 a story about an 18th century sect leader whose followers saw him as the new Messiah. That book won The Nike Prize, a prestigious Polish literary award that has been described as \u201cPoland\u2019s Booker equivalent\u201d and an English translation is expected to release in spring of 2021.\n\nTokarczuk is not new to international acclaim either. Last year, she became the first Polish writer to win the Man Booker International Prize for her novel Flights, about travel in the 21st century, borders and human anatomy. This year, her newly translated book, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead, has been short-listed for the same prize; the story is a thrilling murder mystery in which horoscopes help solve homicides.\n\nTokarczuk said in a phone interview with the Academy shortly after winning the prize that she was \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201ccannot find the right words\u201d to express how she feels. She added that she was happy to know that both awards went to authors from central Europe, noting the region\u2019s challenges with democracy.\n\n\"Such a prize will, in a way, give us a kind of optimism.\"\n\n\n\nWe spoke to Olga Tokarczuk just after she received news of her #NobelPrize - listen to the telephone interview to hear her reaction, and more:https://t.co/6jzREDUWBn\n\n\n\n\u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 10, 2019\n\nTokarczuk is not well liked by Polish conservatives and her criticism of the country\u2019s past, including its anti-semitic episodes has sparked death threats, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cShe is uniquely insightful\u201d when it comes to \u201cfiguring out a person\u2019s psychology,\u201d Jennifer Croft, a translator for two of Tokarczuk\u2019s novels, tells TIME. \u201cShe is really fascinated by people\u2019s quirky eccentricities.\u201d Croft says that she has always been \u201c100% sure\u201d that Tokarczuk would win the Nobel Prize for Literature one day. \u201cI always told publishers that,\u201d Croft says. She describes Tokarczuk\u2019s style as \u201crhythmic, lyrical, clear\u201d and one that aims to \u201creinvent the novel\u201d by connecting seemingly unconnected fragments of stories. \u201cThe reader is supposed to connect it however he or she sees fit,\u201d Croft says.\n\nPeter Handke\n\nHandke received the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature \u201cfor an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience,\u201d the Academy said.\n\nMore than fifty years later, having produced a great number of works in different genres, 2019 Literature Laureate Peter Handke has established himself as one of the most influential writers in Europe after the Second World War.#NobelPrize \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 10, 2019\n\nThe Academy characterizes his work as possessing \u201ca strong adventurous spirit\u201d and a \u201cnostalgic inclination\u201d \u2014 especially in the drama, Walk About the Villages, and the novel, Repetition. His writing \u201cshows and unending quest for existential meaning,\u201d it says. The Academy also praises A Sorrow Beyond Dreams, the \u201cshort and harsh, but deeply affectionate book\u201d written about his mother\u2019s suicide.", "description": "Austrian novelist Peter Handke and Polish author Olga Tokarczuk won the 2018 and 2019 Nobel Prize for Literature, the academy said Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KIxJabi1Cb5ykliWEv9euQ--~B/aD02NTI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/09c63d15fd41be714f77aedcd51e4f59", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
