Watt said that the number could be even higher.\n\nWatt felt that officials didn\u2019t penalize many clear holding violations by Jaguars offensive linemen over the course of Houston\u2019s 13-12 victory. Watt also said that one member of the officiating crew told him his suspicions were justified.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of holding calls out there, it\u2019s every week,\u201d Watt said, via the Houston Chronicle. \u201cThe ref literally admitted to me that guy held me on one play, and he didn\u2019t throw the flag. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do with that after a play. I look over at the ref and he says, \u2018Yes, I saw him hold you, but I didn\u2019t throw the flag.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll probably get fined for this and that\u2019s fine, but I don\u2019t know what to do with that. I\u2019m also very confused. I don\u2019t know what to do there. It\u2019s just part of the game. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve dealt with for a long time. I literally looked over at him and he said, \u2018I know, I saw it.'\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars offense was flagged for holding three times during the game, but it seems Watt is not alone in feeling that number was lower than it could have been.", "description": "There were 5.18 offensive holding calls per game in Week One and the first 15 games of Week Two have seen 4.67 flags thrown for that infraction per game, but Texans defensive end J.J.
