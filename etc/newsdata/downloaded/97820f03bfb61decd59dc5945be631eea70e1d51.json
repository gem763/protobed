During an intense opening night that saw Leonard showered with cheers and boos during introductions, the contest\u2019s twin centerpieces traded highlights while standing in direct opposition in so many ways.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJames rocks fashionable Nikes. Leonard rocks upstart New Balances. James dominated a week\u2019s worth of news cycles with his commentary on China. If Leonard muttered a word, no one heard it. James\u2019s Lakers landed his sidekick, Anthony Davis, through a protracted public recruiting campaign. Leonard plotted for his co-star, Paul George, in silence after turning down the chase to form a Superteam with James on the Lakers. James\u2019s close friend, Rich Paul, has launched the Klutch Sports Agency to represents other professional athletes, inking contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Leonard is represented, in part, by his uncle.\n\nImportantly, James is 34 and plays with the urgency of a man who understands his clock is ticking. Leonard is 28 and plays like urgency is a mental construct that is foreign to him.\n\nBoth players execute their crafts in ways that draw every eyeball in the building. Playing in his first NBA game since March, James burst out of the gate with pent-up excitement. He scored the game\u2019s first points on a reverse layup, quickly set up a Danny Green three and then splashed a turnaround jumper over Leonard after a few rocking dribbles. The Lakers charged to a 13-2 lead, and all the accumulated drama from six straight lottery trips seemed to evaporate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLeonard started slow, whistled for a travel and a charging call early, but he answered soon enough. Like James, he possesses an innate confidence that he can get to his preferred spots whenever he desires. Leonard hit eight of his 11 first-half shots to help the Clippers regain the lead before halftime, draining unblockable fadeaways from the corner and tough back-down jumpers in the paint.\n\n\u201cI got to spots early [and] missed some little chippies,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThen I just started making shots. \u2026 It\u2019s my ninth year in the NBA. I\u2019ve been leading teams four or five years now. It\u2019s just different for me tonight because I have a different coach, I\u2019m in a new uniform, new play calls, new defensive structures. Other than that, it\u2019s just basketball, five on five.\u201d\n\nThe one-on-one battle for Los Angeles, and the Western Conference at large, is on too. James provided the voice-over for a hype video that played up the Lakers\u2019 history of dominance and popularity, while Leonard appeared in an LA-themed New Balance commercial that included him holding a crown key chain and a provocative closing tagline: \u201cThis is his city.\u201d The Clippers played up their differences with the Lakers all night, beginning with a hype video that included phrasing like \u201cstreetlights over spotlights\u201d and \u201cgrit over glam.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first game,\u201d James said. \u201cThe NBA is back, and everybody is trying to have the narrative of a rivalry game and a huge test. Both teams are not who they want to be. We have a lot of room to improve. We\u2019re a new group, a new coaching staff and a new system. It\u2019s not a rivalry.\u201d\n\nOh, but it is.\n\nTuesday confirmed that Leonard has more help. The Clippers were deeper than the Lakers even with George sidelined, as their bench won the scoring battle 60-19. Clippers guard Patrick Beverley pranced around the court, flexing, as his team held off the Lakers down the stretch with a series of defensive stops.\n\nLeonard\u2019s fingerprints were all over the closing effort, from a pump-fake jumper over James to a hard take on Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to a hustle play offensive rebound that burned precious time off the clock. James also had a hand in the Lakers\u2019 demise, committing an untimely turnover with less than three minutes to play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLeonard finished with a game-high 30 points, six rebounds and five assists, outpacing James\u2019s 18 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. For a league whose opening week had been overshadowed by the tense standoff with China and Zion Williamson\u2019s injury, their thrilling duel was a welcome sight. Leonard proved during the 2019 playoffs that he is a worthy proxy for Durant, and his methodical debut reinforced his case as basketball\u2019s best player.\n\nBy the time Leonard had shaken hands with Lakers guard Danny Green, his former Toronto Raptors teammate, and conducted his postgame interview, James had high-tailed it back to the locker room.\n\nPresumably, the revenge plot has already begun in earnest.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The battle for Los Angeles, and the Western Conference at large, is on.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hEl1mZDyADvp5kIIyu4YNkTvMTg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJ2532XVKUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
