REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nZelenskiy, a former television comedian and political novice who was elected president in April, has been thrust into the center of a U.S. domestic political storm after the White House released a reconstruction of his July 25 phone call with Trump.\n\nThe phone call has become the basis for an effort to impeach Trump by Democrats, who say it reveals Trump pressing Ukraine to help smear a political opponent. Trump denies wrongdoing.\n\nIn the call, Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate the business dealings of the son of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner to challenge Trump in an election next year. Zelenskiy agreed.\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nZelenskiy also effusively praised Trump as an inspiration for his own political movement, voiced agreement when Trump criticized a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and said he shared Trump\u2019s view that European politicians had failed to support Ukraine adequately.\n\nUkraine\u2019s opposition European Solidarity party, loyal to former President Petro Poroshenko who was defeated by Zelenskiy in a landslide in April, said it was \u201cdeeply concerned that such inadvertent and ill-considered statements by the President may complicate Ukraine\u2019s international support.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the summary itself showed, during the conversation, President Zelenskiy questioned the assistance provided in recent years to Ukraine by the European Union, in particular, Germany and France,\u201d European Solidarity said in a statement.\n\nPoroshenko has long argued that Zelenskiy\u2019s lack of political experience would be damaging to Ukraine, which has been battling Russian-backed separatists since 2014 in Europe\u2019s only ongoing military conflict.\n\nA lawmaker from Poroshenko\u2019s party, Oleksiy Goncharenko, filed a request to Zelenskiy\u2019s office to release a full transcript of Zelenskiy\u2019s July call Trump. The summary released by the White House was not a transcript but a reconstruction based on notes taken by U.S. officials listening to the call.\n\n\u201cIt is strange that the President\u2019s Office did not publish this transcript simultaneously with the White House,\u201d Goncharenko wrote on Facebook.", "description": "Opponents of Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday they were worried that the Ukrainian president's criticism of European leaders in a call with Donald Trump could damage the country's international standing.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434139645&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0ND", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
