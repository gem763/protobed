The state government will inject $10 million of taxpayers' funds into the project. The council has not revealed any specific plans for the site.\n\nMr Makris was No.49 on the Financial Review Rich List in 2017 with estimated wealth of $1.17 billion. In late 2016 he shifted his headquarters to Queensland after 45 years in Adelaide.\n\nHe announced with great fanfare in 2015 the $200 million project, which was to include a 160-room Sheraton hotel, 131 apartments, 3000 square metres of office space, 3000 square metres of retail space and a cinema complex.\n\nThe site is within walking distance of the hugely popular Adelaide Oval, which underwent a $535 million redevelopment in 2014 and attracts regular sellout crowds to AFL and Big Bash League Twenty20 cricket matches.\n\nA separate 36,000 sq m parcel of land in the inner south-west of Adelaide, which was also previously a Le Cornu furniture showroom and large car park, was sold to German retailer Kaufland for $25 million in early October.\n\nIt was the first large property purchase in Australia by the group, and marks a serious step forward for Kaufland, which has spent the past year or so scouring Australia for potential sites ahead of a launch. It is following in the footsteps of German rival Aldi, which has built a network of almost 500 stores in Australia since opening in 2001.\n\nAldi has been a major thorn in the side of dominant supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles, plus the IGA network. Aldi has made a serious dent in profit margins for the other three players with a predominantly private-label offering, and now has a national market share that Morgan Stanley estimates at close to 8 per cent.\n\nKaufland operates more of a large warehouse-style offering in the mould of United States giant Costco, which has been expanding in Australia and now operates nine big-barn outlets.", "description": "Con Makris has sold the controversial Le Cornu development site in affluent North Adelaide to the Adelaide City Council.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.823%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_972%2C$x_340%2C$y_124/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/397b1d835420a6d8a853768f5bf161beb2a54e21", "published_at": "2017-12-20"}
