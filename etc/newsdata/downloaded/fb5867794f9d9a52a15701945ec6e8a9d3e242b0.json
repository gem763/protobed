But let\u2019s talk about the food.]\n\nThen, when Texas rode Roschon Johnson\u2019s 57-yard run in a 93-yard drive to forge somehow a 10-10 tie early in the third quarter, two more Texans intervened \u2014 one a Texan-Texan, and one a Texan-Alabamian.\n\nA Texan receiver from Richmond, CeeDee Lamb, reiterated his status as a monster of a player, catching pass after pass and bouncing off defender after defender as he amassed 10 receptions for 171 yards and three touchdowns that helped Oklahoma jump ahead and stay ahead.\n\n\u201cConsidering what was at stake at this game,\u201d Lamb said, \u201cthat was obviously a great experience.\u201d\n\nAnd then, even after some dumbfounding errors in the first half, that Texan from Channelview who came to Oklahoma by way of Alabama, Jalen Hurts, RPO\u2019d his way to 131 rushing yards, 235 passing yards, mastery of much of the game and steep praise from Texas Coach Tom Herman, who called Hurts \u201can exceptional quarterback that had a heck of a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely didn\u2019t put the team in the greatest and best situations,\u201d Hurts said of his first-half fumble 13 yards from the end zone and his glaring first-half interception hurled into the end zone, \u201cbut the key about that is we found the way to overcome it.\u201d\n\nThey do look like a team with ample capacity to overcome.\n\nRiding on their third Texan quarterback to contend for a Heisman Trophy in three years \u2014 with Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray already having won the thing \u2014 the Sooners have reached 6-0 with their usual runaway-No. 1-ranked offense hoarding more than nine yards per play and with a fresh accessory that might come in handy should they make the College Football Playoff for the third straight year and fourth time overall.\n\nIf Oklahoma has a defense, then, well: Goodness.\n\nOne year after a trip to the Cotton Bowl sprang both a 48-45 bummer and a firing of their defensive coordinator, they brought their third such coordinator aiming to solve Texas in 52 weeks, counting the Big 12 championship game last December.\n\nOf late, this one alighted at Washington State and Ohio State before bringing along his good record and his apt defensive-coordinator surname \u2014 again: \u201cGrinch\u201d \u2014 and what appears to be one of those schemes that refrains from dabbling in complexity.\n\n\u201cI think they do a really good job of swarming the football,\u201d said Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who ran free often here last year but spent Saturday wrapped in frequent hugs he did not request. \u201cObviously they recruit really well and have extremely talented players, and I feel like they just let them go make great plays.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the scheme is not terribly complex in terms of knowing where they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Herman said, \u201cbut they\u2019re extremely well-coached and confident in how to get there and where to get there and how to fit different runs and routes and coverage. You can tell they really know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley said, \u201cregardless of what the outside world thinks\u201d \u2014 which hasn\u2019t been with a general disparagement \u2014 \u201cwe believe a lot in our defense \u2026 I don\u2019t care what our defensive calls are, schemes. Not that I don\u2019t care, but the way we play right now was the difference today: aggression, fundamentally sound, kept our aggression even in the second half when Texas made a few plays.\u201d\n\nWhen Texas (4-2) made a few plays, the score stood at that 10-10, but the game still seemed tilted if not lopsided. Oklahoma still had that offense, even with Murray with the Arizona Cardinals and the thrilling Marquise Brown with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nWithin that offense, Kennedy Brooks would rush for 107 yards on Saturday, so Texas had to respect his presence. That\u2019s part of why, when Hurts handed him the ball halfway through the third quarter but then Brooks turned around and pitched it back to Hurts, Hurts and everybody else not screaming toward the beer sales noticed Lamb, alone.\n\nHe hauled in the ball 20 yards downfield on the right side, then made an obstacle course through apparent tacklers to stream in beside the right pylon. Oklahoma led 17-10.\n\nWhen Texas made a kickoff-return blunder and began middling around near its own end zone for a while, Oklahoma got a field goal for a 20-10 lead. After Texas went 60 yards in five plays to Ehlinger\u2019s two-yard run for 20-17, the Sooners went a typical 75 yards in a typical six plays, finishing on Hurts\u2019s 27-yard pass to Lamb, who ping-ponged and slid through the final seven yards or so.\n\nAll of that made it 27-17, and deepened the idea of Lamb as a big problem, which may or may not have contributed to the fact that midway through the fourth quarter, Brooks, a Texan, ripped off a 42-yard run, and then Rhamondre Stevenson, a Nevadan \u2014 oh, no! \u2014 went immediately for 24.\n\nSoon, Hurts was in the end zone for a 34-20 lead, and the Oklahoma guns fired from the other end zone per tradition, that left only a few meaningful tunnel scenes. In one, Riley, the 36-year-old head coach, returned from his near-exit to enjoy the moment with Grinch, the 39-year-old coordinator. In another, there went Hurts amid lustrous cheers from Oklahomans around the end of the bowl, for that rare quarterback who stars in a national championship game for one kingdom (Alabama), before a fresh star emerges and he\u2019s off to pursue a similar perch for another.\n\nAll of that, of course, after hailing from among the 28 million of the giant Texas.\n\n\u201cThis hurts, it really does,\u201d said Herman, the latest Texas coach felled largely by Texans.", "description": "The Sooners have long used Texans such as star receiver CeeDee Lamb against Texas.
