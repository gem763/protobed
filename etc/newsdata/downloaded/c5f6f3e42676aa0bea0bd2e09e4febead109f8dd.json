Her lawyer said she had been detained under an international arrest warrant issued by the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: The Russian troll factory at the heart of the meddling allegations\n\nBogacheva was one of 13 Russians indicted last year by the US justice department after the investigation into election interference led by the special counsel Robert Mueller. Three Russian entities, including a notorious state-backed \u201ctroll farm\u201d called the Internet Research Agency, were also indicted.\n\n\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry confirmed on Tuesday that Bogacheva had been arrested and said that it was providing consular assistance. But shortly after the foreign ministry statement, Russia\u2019s embassy in Minsk announced that Bogacheva had been freed.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Belarus\u2019 general prosecutor\u2019s office said that there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for her arrest or extradition to the United States. \u201cShe has been released,\u201d the spokesman said, adding that Minsk would apply to have the international warrant for her arrest invalidated on the territory of Belarus.\n\n\n\nMueller alleges that the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency\u2019s employees, including Bogacheva, posed as US citizens to set up social media accounts aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential vote that brought Donald Trump to power, as well as sowing \u201cdiscord\u201d in the US political system.\n\n\n\nUS investigators say the Internet Research Agency is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d because his companies often provide catering services to the Kremlin. Prigozhin is also reported to provide mercenaries for Russia\u2019s military operations in Syria, Ukraine and parts of Africa.\n\n\n\nBogacheva is accused of working as a translator for the agency and overseeing its data analysis group. She and Alexander Krylova, another agency employee, travelled to the United States in June 2014 on what US investigators say was an intelligence gathering trip.\n\n\n\nBogacheva\u2019s arrest in Minsk briefly looked set to derail relations between Belarus and Russia. Viktor Vodolatsky, an MP from Vladimir Putin\u2019s ruling United Russia party, accused Belarus of a \u201cbetrayal\u201d before news of her release broke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Anna Bogacheva was detained and briefly threatened with extradition to the US after being named in Mueller reportRobert Mueller alleges that Anna Bogacheva and others posed as US citizens to set up social media accounts aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential vote.
