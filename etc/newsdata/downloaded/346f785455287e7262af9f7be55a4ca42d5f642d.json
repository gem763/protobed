We are no longer in that situation. We don\u2019t ask people to pay for fifth grade and we also should not ask people to pay for sophomore year.\u201d\n\nBy some measures, the tuition initiative will be the most ambitious in a growing national movement. College costs and student debt have emerged as major issues in the Democratic presidential primary, with two of the leading contenders for the nomination \u2014 Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 promising to make all public colleges and universities free. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has a more limited proposal to eliminate community college tuition.\n\nSo far, states, not the federal government, have led the way \u2014 sometimes out of a hope that a more educated work force would attract businesses and improve local economies. As of 2018, 17 states had programs promising free college to at least some students, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most of those programs cover tuition only at two-year institutions.\n\nNew York\u2019s Excelsior Scholarship, championed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and enacted in 2017, illustrates some of the challenges New Mexico will face. Excelsior promises free tuition at public two- and four-year colleges to families making up to $125,000, but requires that students have no gaps in their education \u2014 meaning no time away from the lecture hall to work or to care for children or aging relatives. And the scholarship money cannot be used on books, housing costs, child care or any of the other living expenses that can quickly pile up, and eventually cause many to drop out of school.", "description": "Under the plan, tuition to all state colleges would be free for students regardless of family income.", "authors": ["Simon Romero", "Dana Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/us/18NEWMEXICO/18NEWMEXICO-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
