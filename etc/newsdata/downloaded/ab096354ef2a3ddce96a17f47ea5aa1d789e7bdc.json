The new experimental approach has pushed the research frontier forward in crucial ways. First, it helps us identify the causes of poverty. Second, it helps us draw conclusions about causal effects of policies to fight global poverty. And finally it facilitates the analysis of cost effectiveness across different options of policies to reduce global poverty.\"While Banerjee and Duflo become the sixth married partners to collect Nobel Prizes, at the age of 46, Duflo becomes the youngest person ever to be awarded the prize in economics, and only the second woman.Along with Kremer, their combined research found even small differences in prices can lead to dramatically different health outcomes, particularly in preventive care.Thanks to their research, the World Health Organization recommended that medicine be distributed at no cost to more than 800 million schoolchildren in areas where more than a fifth of them suffer from parasitic worm infections.The three winners will split a cash prize of over 900-thousand U.S. dollars, and will also be awarded a gold medal and a diploma on December 10th.Lee Seung-jae, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
