Then, confirming a quid pro quo laid out in the partial summary released by the White House of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mulvaney cited a conspiracy theory involving the DNC server that housed emails leaked during the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and some in the administration have been looking for evidence that the DNC hack was carried out by Ukrainian agents seeking to help the Clinton campaign, rather than Russians trying to help Trump \u2014 which was the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d Mulvaney responded when asked about the president\u2019s public call for China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cAbsolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney speaks to reporters on Thursday. (Evan Vucci/AP) More\n\nIn a tone as defiant as the one used by the president he works for, Mulvaney then asserted that there was nothing improper about placing such conditions on military aid.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy. That is going to happen. Elections have consequences,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nWhen ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl pointed out that withholding aid to Ukraine until an investigation into the DNC server was launched was the very definition of a quid pro quo, Mulvaney responded, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump national security aide Thomas Bossert last month blasted the president and his aides for pushing the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d that the DNC server, which was hacked by Russian intelligence agents during the 2016 election, was now in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only a conspiracy theory, it is completely debunked,\u201d Bossert told ABC News.\n\nDuring his July 25 call, Trump made clear that he placed stock in the story and wanted Kiev\u2019s government to look into it.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, referring to the computer-security company that investigated the hack for the DNC. \u201cI guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Trump and Giuliani asked Ukraine to investigate Biden regarding his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, now the focus of the impeachment investigation in the House. The administration has maintained that its intent was to root out corruption and that it was coincidental that the allegations it was probing involved a leading Democratic candidate to run against Trump in 2020.\n\nMulvaney insisted that withholding military aid had nothing to do with that investigation.\n\n\u201cThe money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden,\u201d he said.\n\nHours after the press briefing, Mulvaney issued a statement in which he accused the media of misinterpreting his videotaped remarks and denying that a quid pro quo had been suggested.\n\n\u201cOnce again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump. Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d Mulvaney said in his statement. \u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that the president withheld military aid from Ukraine because he wanted the country to look for a computer server belonging to the Democratic National Committee.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uL8J4sqxvr5p7Qg8G60KOw--~B/aD0zMjM4O3c9NDg1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/7297b630-f100-11e9-bf5f-b04f405bfd61", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
