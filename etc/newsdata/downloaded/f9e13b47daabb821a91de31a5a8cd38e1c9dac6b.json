Sidney Kahn, a venture capitalist and art collector, bought the property in 1994 for an undisclosed amount. Mansion Global could not verify the price paid for the home.\n\n\n\nMs. Kahn-Ingleby said they knew this was the house for them the moment they saw it.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta Phillips \u2018New Now\u2019 Offers a Mix of Masters and Lesser-Known Artists\n\n\u201cIts architectural integrity and historic value were completely intact, as the house has always been a single-family and never been split up into apartments,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\n\n\nWhile the townhouse\u2019s scale and details were breathtaking, it needed lots of care. So the couple spent years restoring and renovating the house, Ms. Kahn-Ingleby said. The townhouse now offers every modern convenience, while respecting the integrity of the original design and architecture.\n\n\n\nThe home on West 9th Street has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms with a total living space of 4,400 square feet. It features soaring ceilings, a sweeping staircase, and wood-burning fireplaces with marble mantles.\n\n\n\nMs. Kahn-Ingleby\u2019s favorite space is the parlor level, where there is a library to the south, a gallery in the center and the living room to the north. They are all open to one another and the light flows through the rooms, she said.\n\n\n\nThey are selling the townhouse because their children are grown, and one is getting married this week in Scotland, Ms. Kahn-Ingleby said.\n\n\n\nThe townhouse of this quality inside out is extremely rare, said Leslie Mason of Douglas Elliman, who is listing the property on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving sold houses in the village for over 20 years and having lived in the neighborhood almost all my life, I cannot remember ever seeing a house this graceful and complete,\u201d she said. \u201cEverywhere you sit or stand, there is beauty.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore: A Hedge-Fund Manager Is Auctioning His $35 Million Philadelphia Dream Home\n\nThe townhouse market is in some ways independent from the rest of the real estate market in New York, Ms. Mason said. \u201cSometimes a townhouse sale is immediate and sometimes it takes years.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost townhouse buyers are looking for something longer-lasting, and have a vision for their futures, she said. Often they are beginning their families, or making a new transition in their lives. \u201cThey want independence and privacy to live as they wish.\u201d\n\nThe median price of a Manhattan townhouse increased 53% from $3.1 million to $5.2 million in the decade from 2009 to 2018. The price appreciation is twice as fast as that of Manhattan apartments, according to a Douglas Elliman report published in January.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-103936?width=1280"}
