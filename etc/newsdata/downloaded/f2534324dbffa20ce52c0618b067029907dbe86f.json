The Russians and the Syrian regime have made proposals that could save the lives of millions of people who live under our protection. We do not trust their promises. To be honest, it is hard to know whom to trust,\u201d Mazloum Abdi wrote.\n\n\u201cWe know that we would have to make painful compromises with Moscow and Bashar al-Assad if we go down the road of working with them. But if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe deal came after three days of negotiations between the Kurdish forces, Russian envoys and Damascus, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe region has experienced chaos and bloodshed since the U.S. pulled out.\n\nOver the past five days, Turkish troops and their allies have pushed their way into northern towns and villages, clashing with the Kurdish fighters over a stretch of 125 miles. The offensive has displaced at least 130,000 people. On Sunday, at least nine people, including five civilians, were killed in Turkish airstrikes on a convoy in the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian Kurdish officials. President Trump's decision to essentially give Turkey a green light to advance on the country has been widely criticized as abandoning the Kurds, who were instrumental in the fight against ISIS in Syria. (Fox News)\n\nDespite facing widespread backlash over his decision to pull troops from Syria, Trump has insisted it was the right move.\n\n\"Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change,\" he tweeted Sunday. \"Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made.\"\n\nVery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change.
