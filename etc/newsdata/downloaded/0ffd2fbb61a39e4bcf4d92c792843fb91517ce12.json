He had left no financial plan, no insurance payout or policies for his three children\u2019s education.\n\n\u201cHe just never wanted to speak about it,\u201d says Amanda who discovered that the only insurance policy he had was for accidental death. As he had died of a heart attack all those expensive premiums had been a complete waste.\n\n\u201cThe will was signed before the kids were born. I had asked him to do a new will, he did send information to Sanlam, but he never signed it.\u201d\n\nAs he was self-employed there were no company benefits or retirement fund. All he had was less than R200 000 in a retirement annuity which Amanda was left with to raise the children.\n\nI had asked him to do a new will, he did send information to Sanlam, but he never signed it\n\nWithout making some drastic changes to their lifestyle, the money would have run out after just 18 months.\n\n\u201cI was grieving but frustrated. I had thought we still had a time to sort out the finances. Then I realised I can\u2019t change anything, I can\u2019t spend time getting irritated, I must make it work,\u201d says Amanda about her decision to join the 2018 Absa/City Press Money Makeover Challenge. The Money Makeover Challenge takes six individuals through a money bootcamp over six months in which they transform their finances.\n\nAmanda was convinced that she could not find any additional money in her already stretched budget. How do you educate, feed and cloth three children on a single income?\n\n\u201cWhen I signed up for the challenge I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t drink cappuccinos or eat out; where will the extra money come from?\u2019\u201d\n\nYet once she sat down with her Absa financial adviser Risette Visser, Amanda realised that there were changes she could make. In her own words \u201cthere are no holy cows when it comes to money.\u201d\n\nThe first change was to sell her seven-seater car.\n\n\u201cWe were a family of five. Now we are a family of 4, we don\u2019t need such a big car.\u201d\n\nWhat Amanda discovered was that while she saved a bit on the monthly repayment, it was the combined saving of that instalment, insurance and petrol that put R1000 a month back into her pocket. This is money she could now use to start an education fund for her children\u2013- and she has a new car.\n\nAmanda also closed her revolving loan. She was paying fees of R70 a month for a facility that she did not want to be using. She also downgraded her bank status from private bank to premium bank.\n\n\u201cI must admit that was a bit of a hard one to swallow, but I can report that I am very happy with the service so far,\u201d says Amanda who also opted for a cheaper cellphone when her current contract ended.\n\nShe terminated membership to a club that she belonged to: \u201cI did not attend the events \u2013 it\u2019s not fun attending social events as a single person.\u201d\n\nWith the help of Visser, Amanda reviewed her life insurance. This was important as she was now the sole provider for her children.\n\nBy consolidating and shopping around for quotes, she was able to save R600 a month for the same cover.\n\nShe also moved medical schemes to a less expensive option. All-in-all Amanda was able to find an extra R2500 in her budget that she used to pay off her credit card and then start an emergency savings fund.\n\nAmanda shifted her focus and unsubscribed from \u201cspending\u201d newsletters such as Takealot, Superbalist and Zando.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be distracted by the so-called \u2018deals\u2019 and \u2018specials\u2019. Instead she signed up for newsletters on money matters to educate herself and provide motivation. This inspired her to start her own DIY arts and craft blog, titled Wing It.\n\n\u201cThe emphasis of this blog is that you don\u2019t need much to be creative. Look at what is lying around in your home already and use that to make something. I believe that the sponsored posts and ads etc. will eventually become part of the blog, but for now the emphasis is on creating content and growing organically.\u201d\n\nThe outcome of the six-month journey was more than just sorting out her finances, it was life changing. \u201cThe impact of those six months will travel with me for a very long time. I can already see in the rest of my life that the impact is spilling over. I want to get rid of the clutter, I want to sort out my weight, I want to be a more intentional mother, etc. Those six months also provided me with the opportunity to breathe again. I am a lot calmer about money matters than I was a year ago and I am excited to continue this financial journey into the future and strife to become better with money.\u201d\n\nThe impact of those six months will travel with me for a very long time.
