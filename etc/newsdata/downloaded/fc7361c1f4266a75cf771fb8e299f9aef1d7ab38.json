The discount applies to both Tidal\u2019s Premium and HiFi plans, knocking a Premium membership down to $5.99 and a HiFi membership to $11.99 (originally $9.99 and $19.99).\n\nTo redeem the discount, qualifying members can make a new account on Tidal and then select a \u201cFirst Responder\u201d plan. Once the account is created, a verified organization email address will need to be confirmed by SheerID (a company that specializes in verifying groups like first responders and military).\n\nEvery new member will get a 30-day free trial and then pay the discounted price for their subscription. Existing members that are eligible can change their account to a First Responder plan by going through the verification process.\n\nTidal already offers a discount to military and student members, similar to other companies like Pandora, and says it plans on expanding the \u201cCommunity Heroes\u201d discount in the future to include other groups, like teachers, nurses, and other \u201cunderserved community pillars.\u201d", "description": "Today Tidal launched a new \"Community Heroes\" program that offers a 40 percent discount to first responders in the US, including people who are firefighters, police officers, and EMT / EMS.", "authors": ["Dani Deahl", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqX2YFILqlUgvClK1wY2X9vuYpw=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9020425/akrales_170802_1743_0229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
