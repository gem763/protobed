It just means they\u2019re a little bit more cautious because of what\u2019s going on in the broader environment.\u201d\n\nOthers in the industry are less worried, arguing that global events are not likely to a strain spending because many long-term business travel commitments have been made.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think, from a company perspective, we\u2019re going to push down,\u201d David Wieseneck, vice president of finance for e-commerce brand letgo, told Skift about the company's travel plans. \u201cWe make revenue. We have funding from investors. We\u2019re going to continue to grow our business. And if that includes face-to-face travel, then we\u2019re going to have to make it so.\u201d\n\nFace-to-face travel is a big part of companies\u2019 appeal, particularly in sales.\n\n\u201cFor my job, it\u2019s pretty critical,\u201d Mike Ramirez, of software firm Looker, told Skift. \u201cSelling into the enterprise space, you\u2019re doing a couple massive deals a year, which require face time.\u201d\n\nAnnual budgets dedicated to business travel activity are estimated to be between $1 million and $2.5 million, accounting for 12 percent of corporate travelers in the survey.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nEven with virtual-meeting options gaining prominence, respondents were unanimous in their support of in-person visits.
