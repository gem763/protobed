School NATIVITY plays affected by winter election", "language": "en", "text": "Schools could be asked to reschedule their nativity plays so that schools can be used as polling booths for a pre-Christmas general election, it emerged today.\n\nDowning Street wants to go to the polls in December in the hope of getting a majority for a Brexit deal as soon as possible.\n\nBut Boris Johnson has been warned of the logistical problems a winter election could bring, including the need for external lighting at polling booths and contingency plans for bad weather, the Times reported.\n\nTory Party chairman James Cleverly told the BBC's Today programme this morning: 'I don't want to be the Grinch.\n\n'But the point is democracy is incredibly important and we have been prevented on discharging the duty imposed upon us.'\n\nTory Party chairman James Cleverly said this morning: 'I don't want to be the Grinch. 'But the point is democracy is incredibly important'\n\nIt is thought the Prime Minister will lay down the gauntlet to Jeremy Corbyn as soon as the EU grant another Brexit extension, a decision expected tomorrow\n\nMr Johnson could call an election as soon as today amid a Downing Street split over going to the polls.\n\nIt is thought the Prime Minister will lay down the gauntlet to Jeremy Corbyn as soon as the EU grant another Brexit extension, a decision expected tomorrow.\n\nMr Johnson will put forward a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act tonight or on Monday, according to The Times.\n\nBut Mr Johnson is facing mounting Tory resistance, with some believing his chief adviser Dominic Cummings is driving him towards the polls, whereas the PM might be more inclined to plough on with Brexit.\n\nIndeed, it was rumoured that Mr Cummings was furiously banging his fist during a meeting between Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn when the PM suggested a compromise to the Brexit timetable.\n\nDominic Cummings is considered to be the driving force behind Mr Johnson's election plot\n\nMr Corbyn has said Labour is ready to go to the country once it is sure Mr Johnson cannot 'crash out' in a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a campaign.\n\nHowever there is widespread opposition among the party's MPs at a time when they are trailing in the polls.\n\nWhile there are other potential routes to an election, such as Tories voting for a no-confidence motion in their own Government which would only require a simple majority of one, they are also fraught with difficulties.\n\nAny decision is likely to wait until Friday when EU leaders are expected to make their decision on whether, and for how long, there should be another Brexit delay.\n\nIt is widely thought they will agree a so-called 'flextension' to the end of January, with the option for the UK to leave before then if there is agreement in Parliament on a deal before then.\n\nSuch a move would be in line with the request which Mr Johnson was forced to submit under the terms of the Benn Act after he failed to gain approval for his deal at Saturday's special sitting of Parliament.", "description": "Downing Street wants to go to the polls in December in the hope of getting a majority for a Brexit deal.
