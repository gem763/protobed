It\u2019s a choice rooted not only in political and media strategy, but also in pure spite.\n\nDuring the 2016 GOP primary, then-candidate Trump and his team relied on a game plan of booking the future president on as much cable news, TV, radio, and print media as possible, in an explicit effort to dominate the news cycle and drown out the competition. But as he heads into another election year, the president has repeatedly told friends and advisers that he sees little, if any, value in rewarding Fox\u2019s major competitors with sit-downs or call-ins, three people who\u2019ve spoken to him in the past two months tell The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cWhy would I give them the best ratings they\u2019ve ever had, when they\u2019ve been this nasty [and] so corrupt, so vile?\u201d Trump said this past summer on the topic of doing a new exclusive interview with CNN, according to a source with direct knowledge.\n\nNowadays, faced with a rapidly escalating impeachment inquiry and a potentially tough re-election fight, Trump is going to even greater lengths than usual to try to banish\u2014or retaliate against\u2014news outlets he perceives as unfriendly, and to build an even more tightly packed media igloo of praise and flattery for himself.\n\nIt\u2019s a comfort mechanism for the president that intensifies whenever he feels under siege and when scandal swirls. And it is all part of Trump\u2019s ideal scenario of, as one senior White House official sardonically put it, erecting a defensive barrier between himself and news coverage that doesn\u2019t \u201cmake him feel beautiful and powerful.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, the president has\u2014outside the normal press gaggles and conferences for the White House\u2014eschewed numerous mainstream networks or outlets in favor of keeping reliably in his comfort zone: the emphatically pro-Trump environments of Fox News and Fox Business, for instance.\n\nAnd even Fox-levels of fealty sometimes aren\u2019t enough for this president. Since at least March, when he\u2019s felt too many Fox commentators or \u201chard news\u201d hosts have crossed him, he\u2019ll demand White House officials \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on Fox, and encourage associates and supporters to switch over to One America News Network\u2014a channel somehow Trumpier than Fox Business.\n\nStill, he has consistently found his way home to Fox\u2019s bastion of Trump adoration, especially in times of crisis. In the past four months, the president has granted interviews to Fox stars Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity (twice), Brian Kilmeade, Ed Henry, and Jeanine Pirro. Most of the aforementioned hosts also moonlight as some of Trump\u2019s closest informal advisers on messaging, politics, and policy.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t [for] your show, Sean, they would destroy him absolutely,\u201d Trump pal and Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera said on Hannity early this month. \u201cYou\u2019re the difference between Donald J. Trump and Richard Nixon. In Nixon\u2019s case, if he had someone that stuck up for him, he wouldn\u2019t have been, you know, motivated to cover up that burglary. He would\u2019ve let the perpetrators get their just deserts.\u201d\n\nAt the urging of some of his campaign brass, Trump has also given several congenial one-on-ones to local affiliates, including NBC 5 in Dallas and ABC (WDIO) in Duluth, when he\u2019s out on the 2020 campaign trail.\n\nIn that same time, the president\u2019s posture toward other channels and certain major newspapers has gone beyond mere snubbing. On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House planned to order federal agencies to stop renewing subscriptions to The Washington Post and The New York Times, two papers that publish critical coverage Trump routinely bashes as \u201cfake news\u201d that\u2019s ruining the country. The move came the same week that the White House itself announced that, as Trump had requested, it was nixing its print subscriptions to the Post and Times, as well.\n\nAlthough the president made a point of advertising such an apparently petty and catty move, several sources close to him noted that he has been an avid, daily consumer of print newspapers, including The New York Times, for many years, and predicted that it was only a matter of time before Trump began demanding aides bring him copies of the daily editions, or simply print out online versions of Times or Post stories.\n\nIn recent months, the president\u2019s antipathy toward some of Fox\u2019s cable-news competitors has risen to the level of legal threats.\n\nLast week, celebrity attorney and Gawker-killer Charles Harder, representing both Trump and his reelection campaign, sent a four-page letter to CNN president Jeff Zucker and the network\u2019s general counsel, David Vigilante, threatening to sue and seek \u201csubstantial payment of damage.\u201d Harder alleged that CNN\u2014perhaps Trump\u2019s most hated channel\u2014was somehow breaking the law with its on-air coverage of the president and his administration. Late last week, CNN blasted Trump and Harder\u2019s document as a frivolous threat that was \u201cnothing more than a desperate PR stunt and doesn\u2019t merit a response.\u201d (In August, Harder had also threatened to sue NBC for defamation, for a segment on MSNBC\u2019s The Last Word With Lawrence O\u2019Donnell.)\n\n\u201cIn the [2016] primary season, Trump totally dominated the media, completely dominated the media, [and] every political broadcast was about Trump and that made him indomitable in the primary, [when he was] going on every show and flooding the zone,\u201d said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation and a member of Trump\u2019s 2020 media advisory board. \u201cAnd that proved to be very smart strategy. He vanquished the other Republicans running for president. This time around, he is president. He doesn\u2019t have to show up at every CNN broadcast, or on MSNBC. He can be very selective about which shows he wants to go on.\u201d\n\nThe informal Trump adviser recalled that one time during the 2016 presidential campaign, he asked the future president why he didn\u2019t put more money into buying television ads. Trump replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have to buy TV ads because I\u2019m on TV all the time\u2014so they don\u2019t have to watch me during the promotions.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Moore, himself a former CNN contributor, said he didn\u2019t see \u201cany value whatsoever of Trump going on CNN [now],\u201d adding, \u201cwhy aid and abet the enemy? I was with CNN for two years, it\u2019s the hate-Trump network. Why would you do anything that would help them in any way?\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, another sign of Trump\u2019s retreat into a solidly right-wing and MAGA media ecosystem materialized, this one posted to Twitter by Tomi Lahren, a Fox Nation host and Trump superfan. On Wednesday, Lahren tweeted a photo of a sheet of paper the president had signed, thanking her \u201cfor everything.\u201d The page, labeled \u201cReactions to President Trump\u2019s Rally in Dallas, Texas,\u201d was a compilation of tweets, including one of hers, featuring praise or positive news for Trump\u2019s recent event. The print-out also had Twitter posts written by far-right blogger Jim Hoft, Fox News anchor Shannon Bream, the Republican National Committee, and former Wheel of Fortune host Chuck Woolery.\n\nThe autographed piece of paper the Fox Nation host received is actually the result of a long-standing demand that Trump has made of his aides, one that started during the 2016 campaign and continued into his presidency. Following a MAGA rally, staff began compiling packets, which would sometimes stretch numerous pages, exclusively displaying tweets about the rally Trump had just headlined. His campaign team began providing these packets to the candidate to review after each event, so much so that he began expecting them after every rally.\n\nTrump became so accustomed to these pages that, according to a source familiar with the matter, he would complain to senior aides if he didn\u2019t have the packet of Twitter posts in hand to read over within 20 minutes of the campaign rally ending.\n\n\u201cIt remains to this day a source of joy for the president,\u201d one senior administration official said. \u201cHe will sometimes wave [the post-rally print-outs] around, talking about how much people love him and what a great job he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often,\u201d the official added, \u201csomeone from Fox or some guy from the internet tweeting about the president.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s a comfort mechanism for the president that intensifies whenever he feels under siege and when scandal swirls.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571981403/191024-swin-trump-media-tease_muslvm", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
