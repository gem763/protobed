Lucy McBath. The freshman Democrat said Tuesday, \u201cInaction is unacceptable. Today, we are acting to help those in crisis.\" | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo Congress Dem panel tees up gun control bills as GOP stalls\n\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday advanced a trio of gun control bills intended to address a recent scourge of mass shootings, escalating pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take up any legislation on guns.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee completed a late-night marathon markup of gun bills \u2014 including a ban on large capacity magazines that would mark Congress\u2019 strongest step on the issue in 25 years \u2014 that, if signed into law, could dramatically reshape federal rules on access to guns and ammunition.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAll three bills are slated to reach the House floor within weeks, with Democrats eager to draw a sharp contrast with the inaction of the Senate GOP. But without a personal push from President Donald Trump, none is likely to see action in the Senate.\n\nThe first bill, which was approved along party lines late Tuesday, offers federal grant money to states that pass a \u201cred flag\u201d law that allows a judge to order the temporary seizure of guns from a potentially dangerous person.\n\nIt resembles an idea lauded by Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, who has also backed red flag laws. But that text has not been released, and the proposal has drawn criticism from the National Rifle Association.\n\nDemocratic leaders hope the red flag bill \u2014 along with separate legislation to limit gun access of people who have been convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes \u2014 will help coax Senate GOP lawmakers into compromise. The strongest of the three bills, a high-capacity ammunition ban, stands virtually no chance in the Senate.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Doug Collins of Georgia, the panel's top Republican, dismissed all three bills as highly flawed.\n\n\"Like you, I am concerned about addressing this important issue,\" Collins said at the markup. \"I stand ready to work with you on sensible solutions that actually can prevent these atrocities.\" He did not provide specifics.\n\nTwo days after returning from recess, Democrats in both chambers are grasping on a new wave of urgency after shootings this summer killed three dozen people in Ohio, Texas and California.\n\nThe House Democrats' legislative push \u2014 while notable for a Congress that has passed few gun restrictions in its history \u2014 is one-sided and comes with little to no expectation that any of the bills will become law.\n\n\u201cWe are in the same position after the heinous acts of Columbine that we are today,\u201d said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), a veteran lawmaker who served on a congressional task force after the deadly school shooting in Columbine, Colo., in 1999. \u201cI heard the same arguments. I heard, \u2018Let\u2019s wait.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat is different, Democrats say, is the mounting calls for action within their base: more and more people who have witnessed gun violence tear apart their families and communities.\n\nThat includes Rep. Lucy McBath of Georgia), a freshman Democrat who got her start in politics as a gun control activist with a painful personal story: Her son, Jordan, was shot to death at 17.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201908/388/1155968404_6070473615001_6070471300001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\n\u201cShe was not a member of Congress, she was a grieving mother,\u201d Jackson Lee said of McBath, a fellow Judiciary Committee member, as she acknowledged the freshman lawmaker\u2019s contributions to the bills.\n\nDuring the markup, McBath delivered powerful remarks that prompted a rare round of applause from her colleagues in the panel.\n\n\u201cInaction is unacceptable. Today, we are acting to help those in crisis,\u201d McBath said, becoming emotional from her seat. \u201cI promise you. No one is immune to this; don\u2019t ever believe you are immune to this.\u201d\n\nSeveral other members of the panel have seen mass shootings in their districts, including Rep. Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso, Texas, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren who represents Gilroy, Calif. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) represents Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in February 2018.\n\nThe killings in California, Ohio and Texas this summer sent droves of people to lawmakers\u2019 town halls demanding action on guns. It has also reignited the first serious gun policy debate within the Republican Party since teenagers were slain in Parkland.\n\n", "description": "\u201cInaction is unacceptable.
