It is up to the Speaker if this goes ahead.\n\n\n\n5.15pm - Alok Sharma is questioned by the International Development committee.\n\n\n\nWhat I am reading:\n\n\n\nKevin Maguire on Boris Johnson\u2019s hypocrisy", "description": "MPs are divided on the best way to halt the hard Brexit being pursued by Boris Johnson", "authors": ["Jason Beattie", "Image", "Pa", "Uk Parliament Afp Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661260.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
