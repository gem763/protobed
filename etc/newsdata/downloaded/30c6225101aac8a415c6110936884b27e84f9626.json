And maybe, if one of them wins next year, they will, in fact, nick the rich a little\u2014but don\u2019t count on it.\n\nAfter all, the last two Democrat presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy, and yet during their time in office, the effective tax rate on top earners actually fell.\n\nStill, the left likes to say that its goal is to \u201ccomfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.\u201d And yet maybe that\u2019s just a campaign routine. Maybe sometimes the truth is closer to, afflict the afflicted, and comfort the comfortable.\n\nHow so? Well, one way of making the comfortable even more comfortable is by legalizing prostitution. That way, for those so inclined, the man\u2014or woman\u2014who has everything can have even more of everything, with no fear of the prudish police.\n\nA case in point is Elizabeth Warren, whom the betting markets consider to be the Democrat most likely to win the 2020 nomination. On October 10, Warren tweeted some news sure to cheer rich johns\u2014and, of course, poor- and middle-income johns, too: \u201cI am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.\u201d\n\nWe might translate some of this jargon-y code into simple English: \u201cSex work\u201d is the politically correct way of saying prostitution, while \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d really means legalizing, and \u201copen to\u201d means I\u2019m in favor of it, but, I just can\u2019t say so before the election.\n\nSo yes, legalizing prostitution is a part of Warren\u2019s agenda. Indeed, at least four other Democrat presidential hopefuls\u2014Cory Booker, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders\u2014have also declared their support, to some degree or another, for sex-worker \u201cdecriminalization.\u201d\n\nIndeed, such decriminalization is on the Democrats\u2019 to-do list in, of all places, the nation\u2019s capital. Here\u2019s a Washington Post headline from October 18: \u201cD.C. leaders hear from public over proposal to decriminalize sex work.\u201d As the article detailed, the Washington, DC, City Council will be voting on the matter in November.\n\nFortunately, passage of the measure is far from assured; in fact, opponents are vocal and articulate. One opponent, Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, was blunt about what would happen if the bill passes: \u201cBecause this demand [for paid sex] cannot be met locally, traffickers will bring prostituted women and girls from other jurisdictions.\u201d And so, Van Pelt continued, \u201cD.C., the capital of our nation, would undoubtedly become a sex tourism destination.\u201d\n\nIn the words of another opponent, Yasmin Vafa, executive director of Rights4Girls, \u201cThis bill is a sex trafficker\u2019s dream.\u201d\n\nCovering the same story, the New York Times added:\n\nAll sides agree that prostitution practiced openly would reverberate well beyond the city\u2019s thriving but shadowy sex industry of street prostitution, massage parlors, strip clubs and high-end call girls. Prostitutes would most likely work openly out of homes in neighborhoods across the city. Certain blocks could become de facto red-light districts.\n\nIn other words, D.C. wouldn\u2019t just be the swamp, it would be the sex swamp. Yes, the reader can add any joke he or she might wish about politicians and/or lobbyists having new competition for whoredom, and yet still, it\u2019s not amusing to think that the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial would be joined by the Hooker Hotel.\n\nYet we can further add a class dimension to the matter. That is, legal prostitution streamlines the process by which the rich buy\u2014or at least rent\u2014the bodies of the non-rich. Not every rich person is a customer, of course; plenty of fat cats are happily, and loyally, married. And yet it\u2019s also true that the rich tend to spend more money on everything.\n\nLet\u2019s ask ourselves: Who has the most money to spend on prostitutes? Who can bid the highest price for flesh? So we see more clearly that the rich have the most to gain from legalizing sex work.\n\nA case in point is Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team.\n\nWe all remember Kraft and his brush with the vice squad; back in February, the \u201cmasseuse\u201d who allegedly serviced him was busted on a prostitution rap. As for Kraft himself, he had better lawyers, of course, and so he wasn\u2019t arrested. Indeed, his pricy attorneys are battling with prosecutors as of this writing; back in May, they persuaded a judge to toss out the video evidence, and so there\u2019s no way to know how Kraft\u2019s case will ultimately be adjudicated.\n\nWe just know this much: The optics have been horrible for Kraft. He would have been a lot happier if he could have just gone in and out, with no pesky police paying attention.\n\nOf course, prostitution is not just for billionaires; it\u2019s for any horndog with excess cash. And when it comes to disposable income, Democrats are way ahead. In fact, the ten richest congressional districts in the U.S. are represented by Democrats, as are 41 of the richest 50 districts. So with President Warren\u2014or with any of the other pro-decriminalization Democrats\u2013in the White House it seems likely that the laissez-faire approach to sex will become federal policy. And as we know, laissez-faire always works best for the rich.\n\nThus naughty Democrats, even non-plutocrats, would have a new category of pleasure on which to spend their money, legally.\n\nTo be sure, a pro-prostitution Department of Justice might not be able to override state and local laws (although, of course, we should never underestimate the power of liberal lawyers, working with liberal judges and the American Civil Liberties Union to think of tricky end-runs around traditional morality).\n\nIn any case, without a doubt, a Warren-ized DOJ would take some of the pressure off interstate and international and sex-trafficking. And that\u2019s good news for Bob Kraft-types, both in America and coming from around the world.\n\nMoreover, such a hands-off approach would be even better news for the next Jeffrey Epstein. We can recall that the late (we presume) Epstein had an international racket going, bringing in women and girls from Eastern Europe, and sending them on the \u201cLolita Express\u201d\u2014to the Caribbean, New Mexico, even Thailand\u2014for pimpy purposes.\n\nSo while Warren and the other Democrats have said nothing about changing age-of-consent laws\u2014sex with minors being the peculiar predilection of Epstein and, apparently, of other of his rich associates\u2014it\u2019s obvious that if prosecutors have fewer points of leverage on the sex trade, then Epstein-type abuses are more likely to emerge.\n\nThus we can see: Legalizing prostitution would be a great comfort to many among the comfortable.\n\nYet at the same time, Warren\u2019s plan would further afflict the afflicted. Few, if any, women truly want to be prostitutes, and yet if the global magnet of money\u2014complete with marketing and hyping\u2014is turned on and allowed to operate at full power, well, a lot of women, and girls, will be pulled, and pushed, into prostitution. We can observe: This is not liberation, it\u2019s degradation. It\u2019s not empowerment, it\u2019s a kind of slavery\u2014indeed, it used to be called white slavery.\n\nBut wait\u2014there\u2019s more! More, that is, to the Democrats\u2019 plan to comfort the comfortable. You see, not only does Warren want to decriminalize prostitution, she also wants to decriminalize crossing the U.S. border. In other words, every trans-national pimp and procurer will have an easier time bringing nubile bodies across the border\u2014no nosy border guards asking questions and getting in the way.\n\nFittingly, on October 8, Breitbart News\u2019s John Binder analyzed Warren\u2019s overall immigration plan, dubbing it a \u201cdonor class immigration plan.\u201d Notably, Warren\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t include mandatory E-Verify for employers and employees, and so once again, it will be all the easier for sex workers to work\u2014having come from anywhere in the world, regardless of their legal status.\n\nTo sum up, Warren offers a trifecta for comforting the comfortable: First, legalize sex work; second, legalize anyone crossing the border; and third, do little if anything about hiring non-citizens.\n\nSo yes, if she wins, Warren may raise rich people\u2019s taxes. And yet for the randier of the rich, it\u2019s a sweet tradeoff; they\u2019ll pay more in taxes, but her policy platform offers them a happy ending.", "description": "Warren's laissez-faire approach to prostitution means it may become federal policy, and laissez-faire, as we know, benefits the rich.", "authors": ["James P.
