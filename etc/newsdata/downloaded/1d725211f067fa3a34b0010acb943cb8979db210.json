This happened in 2013, for instance, when its decision to legalise same-sex marriage was reversed.\n\nLawmakers who sponsored the bill on Wednesday said they were \"very confident\" that it would not be challenged by federal politicians.\n\nHowever, they acknowledged that there were additional legal uncertainties.\n\n\"This does not entirely remove the risk of people being arrested under [federal] law, and we are being up front with the community about that,\" Attorney-General Gordon Ramsay said in the ACT Legislative Assembly.\n\nNew Zealand is due to hold a referendum next year on whether it should legalise the drug.", "description": "The Australian Capital Territory becomes the nation's only jurisdiction to allow recreational use.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F2DD/production/_108937126_gettyimages-1156788698.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
