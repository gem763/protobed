Members of the Front revealed he would remain at at Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei for observation and treatment.\n\nSham was smashed over the head with hammers and spanners by at least four non-ethnic Chinese attackers on Arran Street in Mong Kok at 7.40pm, a police source said.\n\nThe attack targeting Sham\u2019s head and limbs left three to five wounds on his head. His arms and kneecaps were also injured, according to Lai Yan-ho, a member and former convenor of the Front. \u201cThe wounds have been cleaned and sutured,\u201d he added. \u201cNo bone fractures were detected but his joints were injured.\u201d\n\nLai added that Sham had to stay in the hospital for physiotherapy and further examinations, and would be absent from upcoming public events or protests.\n\nCarrie Lam offers no concessions to Hong Kong protesters; focuses on housing and livelihood issues instead\n\nThe attack came four days before the Front\u2019s planned mass demonstration on Sunday. The pro-democracy group has organised many peaceful anti-extradition protests in recent months.\n\nAfter rumours circulated online that certain ethnic groups were responsible for the attack, Sham appealed to the public to refrain from using violence to right a wrong.\n\n\u201cSham also told us that he was not able to see the perpetrators\u2019 faces clearly or identify their ethnicity, because he was covering his head with his hands during the assault,\u201d Lai told the press.\n\n\u201cHe also said the root of the problem actually lies in the violence of our social structure and the heartlessness and injustice of the regime, which has not allowed the five demands to be met,\u201d said Lai.\n\nJimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights remains in stable condition at Kwong Wah Hospital.

We hope the police will investigate and arrest the assailants as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe Front stated that Sham\u2019s injury would not affect their planned march on Sunday, which calls for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality, the abolishment of the anti-mask law and the reformation of the police force.\n\nHuman Rights and Democracy Act passes first vote in the US, with Senate vote next\n\nThey urged the force to grant a letter of no objection to them as soon as possible to protect the safety of the protesters. \u201cIn the face of police and triad brutality in the past few months, citizens who support peaceful, rational and non-violent means [of protesting] are longing for a legal, peaceful and safe rally where they can voice their concerns,\u201d Chan said.\n\nBoth Lai and Chan also called on citizens to take to the streets on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe hope [the general public] could participate in the march to speak up for Sham, as well as those who have been injured, arrested and detained during [the anti-government] movement,\u201d said Chan.\n\nThe attack was the second against Sham in less than two months. In late August, Sham and his assistant Law Kwok-wai were set upon by two people in masks wielding a baseball bat and a rod, which happened hours after a rally planned by the Front for the following weekend had been banned.\n\nEdited by Jamie Lam", "description": "Pro-democracy group urged the public not to retaliate with acts of violence and asked the police to grant a letter of no objection for their mass rally.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/45b6a462-f094-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_152410.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
