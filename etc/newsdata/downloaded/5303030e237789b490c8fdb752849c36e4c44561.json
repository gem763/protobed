Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the White House national security official and decorated Iraq war veteran who was testifying on Tuesday that he had heard Mr. Trump ask Ukraine to investigate his Democratic political rival.\n\nOne pundit on Fox News went as far as to suggest that Colonel Vindman had engaged in \u201cespionage\u201d against the United States, prompting an unusual rebuke from a Republican member of Congress.\n\nColonel Vindman, who received a Purple Heart after he was wounded in Iraq, is a Ukrainian-American immigrant who was 3 years old when his family fled to the United States. On her Fox News program on Monday, the conservative host Laura Ingraham sought to turn his ethnic background against him, noting that Ukrainian officials had recently sought the colonel\u2019s advice about interacting with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.", "description": "Just before the Purple Heart recipient spoke to House impeachment investigators, a host at Fox News and right-wing internet figures questioned his patriotism.", "authors": ["Michael M.
