Discussions about rescheduling the match within 48 hours are underway.\n\n'All sportsmanship reports are reviewed by the league office and our members conduct investigations into the report. Our members then report out the findings of the report to the league office. The CAA is governed by a membership approved Constitution and Bylaws located on our website,' the statement read.\n\nBut after a phone conference and in person meeting, no conclusion was made about what transpired.\n\nCaurus assistant principal and athletic director, Wendy Davison, said the incident was not caught on tape and had not seen by administrators and that players were 'confused' by what was happening.\n\n'Those are the facts and we apologize for the fact that there was a disruption or the fact that anybody felt that they could not move forward with the game,' she said.\n\n'We respect [Salt River's], there is no doubt about that. I think it's important to note that there were no sanctions levied against either member school, the investigation is closed, we want to move forward with Salt River, we're going to partner with Salt River, we're going to partner with the CAA to move forward so that we can all enjoy winter and spring sports,' she added.\n\nSalt River alumni Keith Andreas posted about the incident to Facebook, adding a photo of the Caurus gym where signs read 'Dude. Be nice.'\n\n'Ironic that a school with this hanging in the gym finds it acceptable to mock our girls volleyball team Salt River High School (SRHS) by trying to War-hoop and blatantly call one of our girls savages,' he wrote.\n\n'When does it end? Because we are still here and are not going anywhere. #WhiteAmerica #RacismNeverDied,' he said.\n\nAndreas added that Caurus faculty and staff brought the incident down to, 'boys will be boys' and 'They are just cheering.'\n\nSalt River High School is located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian reservation in Mesa, Arizona\n\nThe game was rescheduled for Friday as the athletic association investigated but no conclusion was made about what transpired\n\nDebbie Nez-Manuel told AZ Central about her granddaughter's experience as a member of the heckled team.\n\n'There is no reason to be called a savage in today's world. ... I mean that (behavior) in general is just inappropriate, there is no other way to describe it,' she said. 'Those were displays of racism and the fact that these kids were encouraged and not disciplined for that type of behavior only promotes it in other schools and other situations.'\n\nTat\u00e9 Walker, a spokesperson for Salt River Schools, said in a statement Friday that this incident highlights a larger issue that requires attention.\n\n'Tuesday's events go beyond one volleyball game and are indicative of systemic discrimination problems that are difficult for many to acknowledge across the education landscape, especially when it's so much easier to claim ignorance or unintentionality.\n\n'There are more conversations to be had, especially with regards to how discrimination, inclusion and restorative justice is handled within schools \u2014 whether in the classrooms or on the court,' Walker said.\n\nThe game was rescheduled for Friday at Desert Heights Prep Academy, where an overwhelming amount of fans came out to support Salt River.\n\n'I've never had such a big turnout for one game,' said Sialik King, captain of the Salt River team. 'It was very nice to see that us, as indigenous people, could come together for this game.'", "description": "Salt River High School's girls varsity volleyball team were taunted with Native American slurs when they played Caurus Academy last Tuesday in Anthem, Arizona.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20328290-0-image-a-27_1572361505115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
