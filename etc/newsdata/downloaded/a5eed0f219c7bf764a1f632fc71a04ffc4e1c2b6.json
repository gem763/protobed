Taylor earned more than \u00a32 million last year and the PFA spent only \u00a3563,261 on its entire benevolent fund for former players in need. The PFA also spent \u00a39 million on Premier League and Football League youth development and community funds in that same period.", "description": "The Premier League will be urged to support the creation of a new industry-wide fund to cover the care costs of former professional footballers living with dementia in the build-up to a shareholders\u2019 meeting next month.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/MASTER-LETTER-BOX-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVaEzIOIwv0yCR1SNh5YOKq1cHhalxiicmCqqzJ0GpSs.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
