We\u2019re living in a climate emergency, yet even while we still have the power to make a huge step-change, the government does nothing. Time is ticking, and I have felt utterly compelled to make a stand.\n\nI have taken my eight-year-old daughter down to the climate strikes in Exeter, placards and face paints in hand. Watching some of these young voices speak out about the impacts of fast fashion or endless consumption of fossil fuels against a backdrop of samba bands and chants for climate justice is far from scary or intimidating. To witness this global climate movement up close is empowering, invigorating and eye-opening.\n\nOn Monday, Extinction Rebellion (XR) begins a two-week protest in capital cities around the world, and I\u2019m looking forward to watching how it unfolds. As a scientist and a sustainability journalist, I realise that urgent action is absolutely necessary to avert climate catastrophe and social collapse.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd yet, I haven\u2019t yet been to any XR meetings or booked my train to London. However inspiring I find the movement, something\u2019s holding me back from joining up.\n\nI\u2019m inspired by the doctors, surgeons and lawyers risking everything to stick their heads above the parapet, pump fake blood from a fire engine over the Treasury or superglue themselves to government buildings. XR comprises such a diverse mix of ages, backgrounds and vocations \u2013 it\u2019s not the most conventional bunch of eco-warriors. I share their deep grief and concern.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Extinction Rebellion protesters block roads in five cities Show all 22 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

definitely don\u2019t want to risk a prison sentence \u2013 unlike the 1,000 peaceful protestors arrested in April when XR disrupted transport networks at four sites across London.\n\nMaybe XR just isn\u2019t my style. The branding is very conspicuous and intense \u2013 it doesn\u2019t match my natural tendency towards risk aversion. A few days ago, there was a backlash on Twitter after XR pushed out a poster dismissive of the \u201ctreehuggers\u201d that used to define the environmental movement. It was swiftly removed, but I get the feeling I\u2019m not the only one feeling slightly out of my comfort zone, alienated, or unsure whether I fit the \u201ctypical\u201d rebel profile.\n\nBut with any mass movement, there always comes a tipping point. In a review of civil resistance and social movements from 1900 to 2006, Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard University, has concluded that civil disobedience is the most powerful way of shaping world politics \u2013 and that for a protest movement to succeed, 3.5 per cent of the population needs to join the cause.\n\nI do expect a tipping point will also come within me. I\u2019ll observe from the sidelines for just a little bit longer, read Extinction Rebellion\u2019s handbook, This is not a Drill, and quiz my friend on her return from Lambeth Bridge next week about the reality of her experience. As \u201cpolice liaison\u201d, she has a weighty responsibility, acting as the conduit between police and protesters. Unsurprisingly, she\u2019s a little apprehensive.\n\nBut she\u2019s reassured by XR\u2019s practical and cleverly thought-out framework and the knowledge of her fellow protestors \u2013 everyone remains autonomous, non-violent and extremely well-supported, with no pressure to partake.\n\nHopefully, soon I\u2019ll be ready to channel my angst and be civilly disobedient. To everyone stopping traffic, camping on the streets, causing disruption throughout Westminster and making headlines next week, I say good luck. I\u2019m almost there with you.", "description": "I\u2019ve never been much of a rebel, but this year I\u2019ve been protesting.
