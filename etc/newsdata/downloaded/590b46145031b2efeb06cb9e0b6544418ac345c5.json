I am happy that, at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of Macbeth, which I consider my last performance on the Met stage.\u201d\n\nNine accusers (eight dancers and a singer) came forward against Domingo in August. One of them said he had allegedly placed his hand down her skirt and three other women alleged that he had forced \u201cwet kisses\u201d onto their lips.\n\nSeven of those nine women told the Associated Press (AP) that they felt their careers had been adversely impacted after allegedly rejecting Domingo\u2019s advances.\n\nIn addition, half a dozen other women claimed to AP that suggestive interactions with Domingo had made them feel uncomfortable.\n\nDomingo told AP in a statement at the time: \u201cThe allegations from these unnamed individuals dating back as many as thirty years are deeply troubling, and as presented, inaccurate.\n\n\u201cStill, it is painful to hear that I may have upset anyone or made them feel uncomfortable \u2013 no matter how long ago and despite my best intentions. I believed that all of my interactions and relationships were always welcomed and consensual. People who know me or who have worked with me know that I am not someone who would intentionally harm, offend, or embarrass anyone.\n\n\u201cHowever, I recognise that the rules and standards by which we are \u2013 and should be \u2013 measured against today are very different than they were in the past. I am blessed and privileged to have had a more than 50-year career in opera and will hold myself to the highest standards.\u201d\n\nThe LA Opera announced its intention of launching an investigation into the women\u2019s allegations thanks to outside counsel back when the allegations first emerged.\n\nEleven more women came forward against Domingo early in September after the August story was published.\n\nDomingo\u2019s spokeswoman Nancy Seltzer said at the time: \u201cThe ongoing campaign by the AP to denigrate Placido Domingo is not only inaccurate but unethical. These new claims are riddled with inconsistencies and, as with the first story, in many ways, simply incorrect. Due to an ongoing investigation, we will not comment on specifics, but we strongly dispute the misleading picture that the AP is attempting to paint of Mr Domingo.\u201d\n\nThree other companies \u2013 the Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera \u2013 had already removed Domingo from upcoming performances following the accusations.\n\nDomingo\u2019s departure from LA Opera raises questions about the future of his career in the US, where he has been removed or has stepped down from all of his scheduled appearances for this year and next.\n\nHe still has a busy schedule of concerts across Europe, where the reaction to the allegations has been more muted.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Opera star Placido Domingo has resigned as general director of the Los Angeles Opera following multiple allegations of sexual harassment.
