City officials announced this week that they believe they can shrink the jail population even further by 2026, to just 3,300 prisoners.\n\nBackers of the jail overhaul say they expect the city\u2019s jail population will keep dropping because of criminal justice reforms.\n\nSeveral district attorneys in the city have said they are no longer prosecuting small-time marijuana possession cases. The police department, after ages of measuring officers by how many people they put in handcuffs, has slashed arrests for misdemeanors as officers have been encouraged to write tickets for minor offenses, rather than drag people to jail.\n\nA new state law is set to eliminate cash bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent arrests. Once the law goes into effect in January, far fewer poor people will be held in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nCritics of the plan are skeptical, however, saying fewer cells may mean more violent criminals on city streets.\n\nSeth Barron, project director of the NYC Initiative at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, questions whether the city can really drive incarceration rates as low as they want without compromising public safety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear how they\u2019re going to get these numbers and it\u2019s politically driven,\u201d Barron said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big risk because we\u2019ve already taken all the nonviolent people out of Rikers.\u201d\n\nBarron blames the effort to empty the city\u2019s jails for the beating deaths of four homeless men in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown this month.\n\nRandy Santos, the man charged with attacking the men as they slept, had been recently freed from jail after several arrests for previous, less serious attacks on other people.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that progressive social policies gave Santos the freedom to feed his addictions and nurture his insanity \u2014 until he murdered four innocent people,\u201d Barron wrote in the institute\u2019s City Journal .\n\nInmates would be moved to four new or expanded jails in each city borough except Staten Island under the proposal, making it easier for the inmates to receive visits from lawyers and family members who will no longer have to travel to an island.\n\nThe plan met some resistance from residents of neighborhoods surrounding the jail sites. City Council leaders announced Tuesday they would decrease the heights of the planned jails to win support. A prison skyscraper planned for lower Manhattan was cut from 45 to 29 stories and a proposed Brooklyn jail went from 39 to 29 stories. City Council member Margaret Chin, a Democrat who represents lower Manhattan, said the shorter jail tower planned for her district \u201cwill no longer be out of scale with the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nBut others say they don\u2019t want any new jails at all. Marlene Nava Ramos, a member of the advocacy group No New Jails NYC, said \u201cthe idea is to begin actually decarcerating New York City instead of building new jails.\u201d\n\nMartin Horn, who headed the city Department of Correction from 2003 to 2009 under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said reducing the jail population to 3,300 would be \u201ca historic accomplishment\u201d but he questioned the 2026 deadline for completing the new jails.\n\n\u201cMy experience is that city construction projects of this magnitude take far longer,\u201d said Horn, who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nRikers Island has housed jail inmates since the 1930s and has long been known for brutality. The jail complex saw hundreds of stabbings each year during the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nMore recently, a 2014 Associated Press investigation detailed dozens of inmate deaths including that of a homeless ex-Marine who essentially baked to death in a hot cell.\n\n\u201cI know what damage Rikers does to people. Rikers is not a fit place for human beings,\u201d said JoAnne Page, president of the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organization that provides support to formerly incarcerated people.\n\n\u201cWe are moving in the right direction after so many years of moving in the wrong way,\u201d she said.", "description": "New York City lawmakers are moving a step closer to closing Rikers Island, a massive jail complex notorious for violence and dysfunction that is increasingly...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT496_rikers_ZG_20191017092305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
