They have been fighting Turkey for decades,\" Mr Trump said in an earlier series of tweets.\n\nA member of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) takes part in a demonstration alongside Syrian-Kurds in the town of Amuda Credit: AFP More\n\n\"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out.\"\n\nUS Republican and Democrats had warned such an offensive on the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), which lost 11,000 troops in the battle against Isil, could lead to a massacre of Kurds and send a worrying message to American allies across the world.\n\nThe US began pulling back some of its 1,000 troops from border towns Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn on Monday, and has said it will potentially depart the country should widespread fighting break out.\n\nThe announcement, first made by the White House overnight on Sunday, appeared to take both the Kurds and US coalition forces, which had been carrying out joint patrols with Turkey on the ground, completely by surprise.\n\nKurdish sources say they were acting in good faith trying to establish a security mechanism with the US to placate Turkey, but now felt that Ankara had been using it as a cover for reconnaisance.\n\nMustafa Bali, spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), tweeted: \"We are not expecting the US to protect NE #Syria. But people here are owed an explanation regarding security mechanism deal, destruction of fortifications and failure of US to fulfill their commitments.\"\n\nThe White House statement was released after a phonecall between US President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday night.", "description": "US President Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0warned\u00a0Turkey\u00a0against going too far in Syria, after giving Ankara a green light to invade its southern neighbour.
