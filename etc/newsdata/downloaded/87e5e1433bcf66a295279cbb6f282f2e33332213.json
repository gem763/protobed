What should we expect from child-care providers, and how can we identify the high-quality options? I asked some experts for answers.\n\n\u201cParents really have to become their own private investigators\u201d\n\nChild-care research can be nerve-racking, especially in what feels like a vacuum compared with the barrage of pregnancy and baby-related reference books. Time is precious: Many mothers begin their search while still pregnant, according to Child Care Aware of America, which conducted focus groups of parents across four states in 2016. The national nonprofit organization found that although word-of-mouth referrals from friends and family were the preferred source of information and recommendations, the Internet \u2014 Google searches, Facebook pages and groups, Yelp reviews \u2014 was also a common resource.\n\nThe reliability of this type of sourcing is shaky at best. In March, the child-care marketplace Care.com removed 46,594 day-care centers \u2014 about 72 percent of its listings \u2014 from its website. The change came just before the publication of a Wall Street Journal report that found the company\u2019s \u201cpreliminary screening\u201d process failed to verify caregiver credentials or to check for criminal histories, including cases of sexual assault and child abuse. The resulting backlash led to founder and chief executive Sheila Lirio Marcelo\u2019s resignation in August.\n\nMichelle McCready knows the stories. \u201cIt can be terrifying,\u201d says the deputy executive director of Child Care Aware of America of finding quality providers. \u201cParents really have to become their own private investigators and, frankly, do a lot of the legwork themselves.\u201d\n\nSo where should parents look for reliable resources? For one, McCready pointed to her group\u2019s Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) partners, agencies whose services are free and can \u201chelp navigate through things like licensing and inspection reports.\u201d\n\nCCR&R agencies operate at the local level and offer referrals for vetted child-care providers, information on state licensing requirements and financial information for low-income families. Parents can locate and work with an agency via phone or email by filling out their online search form.\n\nParents who prefer a more hands-on approach can browse the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 database of child-care resources in their area, including names and contact information of administrative staff, past complaints, employee names and background check statuses, and a history of state inspections.\n\nFor parents learning toward nanny care, McCready says it\u2019s important to understand that nanny agencies aren\u2019t necessarily subject to the same regulations as care centers. In addition to checking references, she suggests performing the same background check required for care centers under federal law, including:\n\nAn FBI fingerprint check to verify identity, employment and criminal history.\n\nA search of the National Crime Information Center\u2019s national sex offender registry\n\nA search of the state registries where the applicant has lived within the past five years. This includes the state criminal registry or repository (many states provide free online resources and database searches); the state sex offender registry ; and the state-based child abuse and neglect registry and database\n\nThe International Nanny Association recommends asking for proof of education, CPR and first aid certifications to make sure your caregiver\u2019s training aligns with your expectations. You should also review candidates\u2019 driving records if your nanny\u2019s duties involve shuttling the kids to school.\n\nLook beyond licensing\n\nCredentialed care is highly valued by parents, whether it\u2019s a licensed day care or a nanny with a clean background check. That said, are the standard requirements enough?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that licensing is there for health and safety reasons,\u201d says Jim Elicker, a child development researcher and professor of human development and family studies at Purdue University. Caregivers \u201chave to meet those basic requirements for licensing, but that\u2019s far from providing a high-quality child care experience.\u201d\n\nFortunately, there are ways to grade care centers beyond state-mandated benchmarks. Supported by the national Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), states can provide a list of caregivers that excel in the areas crucial to child development, including lower student-teacher ratios, social and emotional development, outdoor play, nutrition, language development, and superior classroom environments. \u201cEvery state has a different system, although there\u2019s a fair amount of overlap,\u201d Elicker says. \u201cBased on their standards, they can assign a quality level to any provider who\u2019s in their regulatory system. In most places, that doesn\u2019t cover informal neighbor or family friend care, but it does usually include licensed child-care centers and licensed family child-care homes,\u201d he says.\n\nAdhering to licensing requirements typically qualifies care providers for the lowest QRIS rating, and in addition to a high-quality curriculum, Elicker says individual teacher qualifications are often a factor in securing a higher score.\n\n\u201cIn general, the more education any caregiver has had that\u2019s focused on child development and early education, the better,\u201d he says. \u201cAnother thing to ask is if there\u2019s any ongoing in-service training for the staff. . \u2026 As you work with kids month to month, staff development needs can emerge and certain kinds of problems with your family clients can emerge, and you need to respond in a way that involves learning.\u201d\n\nState-specific QRIS information can be found via HHS\u2019s QRIS Resource Guide.\n\nSpend some time in the environment\n\nEven if your care provider of choice looks great on paper, McCready and Elicker agree that there\u2019s no substitution for firsthand experience. Schedule a tour to see how the center functions on a normal day. McCready recommends spending two to three hours observing the classroom and asking questions. A day care\u2019s willingness to accommodate prospective parents is telling, as is its representatives\u2019 ability to answer detailed questions. \u201cAsk for a schedule of daily activities including mealtimes, activities, nap and who will be interacting with the child during those times,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a staff teacher is ill, who takes over? How often are those people with the kids?\u201d\n\nMcCready also encourages parents to pay attention to the staff\u2019s level of engagement and general mood. \u201cThe number one driver of quality is how an adult is interacting with a child. All the brain science shows that it\u2019s not just about learning the ABCs, but really that emotional, social nurturing ability \u2014 that\u2019s where the mind and the brain develop,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s also wise to ask the day care director about the staff\u2019s compensation and level of turnover, because a lack of consistency can be difficult for young children to manage. \u201cChild care is one of the lowest-paid professions,\u201d McCready says. \u201cIf staff are supported and well compensated, that is going to keep them in that position.\u201d\n\nPreemptive observation is more difficult for in-home care, and just as you would observe a day-care setting, spending time with a potential nanny is key.\n\n\u201cIf I were looking for a nanny to care for my own child, I would do more than just have a sit-down interview for half an hour,\u201d Elicker says. \u201cI would invite them to come and spend an afternoon with me and my kids and do some things like go to the park, have a picnic, so that I can really get a better sense of what kind of a person they are. Do they really enjoy being with kids and are they making a connection? Are they showing an interest in my kids as individuals \u2014 in other words, are they asking me questions about each of them and what they what they typically like to do, what they eat, and so on?\u201d\n\nElicker notes the added stress level that comes with an unregulated environment and says a nanny cam could be useful and comforting in the early days, but only with the nanny\u2019s knowledge.\n\n\u201cI certainly think nannies should be informed upon hiring if they are going to be recorded,\u201d he says, \u201cbut really, how else would parents know what is going on while they are away? There is a parallel to this in university laboratory preschools, which often have observation booths with one-way mirrors in every classroom. While this may be nerve-racking for some new staff, I have observed that most teachers get used to it, and I believe it has a positive effect on teaching and caring quality.\u201d\n\nA child-care solution isn\u2019t coming soon for American parents. As we continue to tread against the current of limited options, year-long wait lists and high costs, it\u2019s somewhat comforting, if not typical, to know that we can manage the issue with a little research and a lot of self-reliance. In that respect, we\u2019re all experts.\n\nSarah Szczypinski is a journalist living in Seattle.
