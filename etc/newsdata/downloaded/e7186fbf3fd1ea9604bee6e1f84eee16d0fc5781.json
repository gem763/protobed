The National Rifle Association (NRA), which claims to be the nation\u2019s \u201coldest civil rights organization\u201d and a fierce defender of the free market, responded by accusing the retail giant of attacking the Second Amendment.\n\nWalmart faced considerable pressure from its own employees and customers to reduce or eliminate the sale of guns and ammunition in light of the latest deadly mass shootings. Stores in El Paso, Texas, and in Mississippi last month were the latest Walmart locations to be home to such attacks.\n\nAfter making the announcement, the NRA quickly called the company\u2019s decision a \u201cshameful\u201d cave to the \u201cpressure of the anti-gun elites.\u201d\n\n\"It is shameful to see @Walmart succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites. Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms.\" Read @NRA's statement on Walmart's decision here: pic.twitter.com/bmwAS9o0KP \u2014 NRA (@NRA) September 3, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA wrote that the \u201cstrongest defense of freedom has always been our free market economy.\u201d But apparently, their support for the free market does not include companies getting to choose which goods and services to sell.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1160088416-e1567541321703.jpg?w=1023&h=693&crop=1"}
