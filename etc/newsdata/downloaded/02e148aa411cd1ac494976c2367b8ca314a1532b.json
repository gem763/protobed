People just want to get this done and look forward to other things, like negotiating a free trade deal,\" said Stefan Koopman, senior market economist at Rabobank.\n\nUncertainty about UK's orderly exit from the EU and other geopolitical tensions, combined with slowing global growth, have rankled financial markets this year.\n\nAfter a solid increase in the first quarter, gains in the STOXX 600 index have tapered off in the second and third. Fresh data on Friday showed China's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter.\n\nInvestor focus now turns to the third-quarter earnings season, which kicks off in earnest next week. An earnings recession in Europe is expected to deepen in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nEarly earnings reports, however, were a mixed bag, with weak results from the defence and retail sectors, but a strong report from Swedish medical technology group Getinge. Its shares jumped 16.3% to the top of STOXX 600 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly core profit.\n\nThales, the largest European defence electronics company, dropped 3.5% after lowering its 2019 revenue growth forecast, while yogurt maker Danone tumbled 6.2% after narrowing its sales growth outlook for 2019.\n\nLondon Stock Exchange rose 2.4% after reporting a higher-than-expected third-quarter income ahead of the planned shareholder vote on its deal to buy data provider Refinitiv.\n\nThe German index ticked higher, with help from Deutsche Post AG after Berenberg upgraded the stock to \"buy\", while gains in banks propped up Spanish and Italian bourses.
