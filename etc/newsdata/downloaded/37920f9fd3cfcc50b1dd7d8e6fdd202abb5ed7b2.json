Agent Phil Coulson died in The Avengers, and was resurrected for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Bucky Barnes appeared to die in Captain America: The First Avenger, and came back as the antagonist in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Even Loki, a villain turned semi-hero, seemingly died in Thor: The Dark World, came back for Thor: Ragnarok, died again in Avengers: Infinity War, and is back in play due to time-travel shenanigans as of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nSo it\u2019s natural to ask whether Avengers: Endgame\u2019s big deaths will eventually be undone as well. There\u2019s precedent in the comics for Tony Stark\u2019s resurrection after death, but will Black Widow\u2019s death be permanent? She\u2019s set for her own standalone film soon, though rumor has it that it will be a prequel. But there are plenty more MCU movies to come, she\u2019s a fan-favorite character, and killing off the franchise\u2019s most significant and central female character is a bad look for the entire series. So how would Marvel handle bringing her back from the dead?\n\nIn Endgame, Natasha Romanoff and Hawkeye are tasked with retrieving the Soul Stone from Vormir, which requires one of them to sacrifice themselves. They fight over who gets to die, and Natasha \u201cwins.\u201d Her sacrifice wins them the Soul Stone, in a way that supposedly \u201ccan\u2019t be undone\u201d by any form of the time travel that winds up resurrecting the rest of the MCU fallen later in the film.\n\nSacrifices for the Soul Stone can\u2019t be undone and yet Gamora is back\n\nBut the film itself contains a clue: Thanos killed his daughter Gamora in Infinity War to obtain the stone, and she\u2019s alive and well by the end of Endgame. She survives because she time travels from the past, skipping around the part of her history where Thanos sacrificed her. That seems like one easy path to Natasha\u2019s resurrection. The only downside is that she wouldn\u2019t be the latest, up-to-date version of the character \u2014 if the Avengers went back in time too far, they might meet a hostile Natasha who hadn\u2019t yet joined S.H.I.E.L.D. And then she\u2019d apparently be missing from her original timeline, though Endgame notably glosses over any effects that would have on anything other than an Infinity Stone.\n\nRegardless of whether Black Widow\u2019s standalone film takes place before The Avengers or after Endgame, the franchise would be better served if she ends up alive again. There hasn\u2019t yet been a standalone film about a Marvel character who\u2019s fated to die, which creates the usual prequel problem of finding it hard to invest in a drama about a character whose complete future fate is known.\n\nAnd it would be depressing to have the series casually forget her, while resurrecting so many other people over the years. Before Captain Marvel graced our screens, there was Natasha Romanoff, holding her own alongside the Avengers\u2019 otherwise male crew, kicking ass against alien villains and petty human mobsters alike. Sure, it would be cool to explore her time escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, or growing up in Russia as Natalia Romanoff, but her drama potential is extremely limited as solely a prequel character. It\u2019ll be more exciting to see how the Avengers devise a way to bring her back.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence from the comics that the Black Widow could be brought back. In one comics plotline, Black Widow is infected with a molecular poison, but is later revived by Stone, a ninja who can wield mystic energies. In the Secret Empire series, she dies \u2014 but it turns out a secret program has repeatedly cloned her, and one of the clones ends up with her memories, effectively rebooting her character.\n\nOther MCU characters have been brought back in creative ways as well. Phil Coulson, for instance, was resurrected by having his corpse injected with an alien serum. The experience is so traumatizing that Coulson loses his will to live, so the doctors who revived him also altered his memories so he believed he\u2019d simply been recuperating in Tahiti.\n\nThere\u2019s another time travel possibility as well, rooted in the sequence we don\u2019t see, as Captain America returns the Infinity Stones to the exact times and places they were taken from. One fan theory suggests that if Black Widow had to die to prove Hawkeye was worthy to take the Soul Stone, Cap could broker her resurrecting by giving the Stone back at Vormir. That\u2019d be a cheap solution, but given how unclear the mechanics of the Soul Stone are (who exactly is keeping it hidden and demanding these deaths?) there\u2019s always the possibility of new information to fill in. And there\u2019s a long history of stories where heroes who nobly give up their lives for the greater good are brought back by a higher power.\n\nFinally, there are the questions raised by the way Black Widow died in the first place. Red Skull says claimants for the Soul Stone have to give up something they love, but Hawkeye doesn\u2019t sacrifice Black Widow the way Thanos sacrificed Gamora \u2014 Black Widow jumps willingly, and Hawkeye fights her all the way. They don\u2019t follow the stated rules at all, and maybe that will make a difference in how her future plays out. It\u2019s not much to go on, but it\u2019s possible her noble death meant something in the long run, and it could be the key to bringing her back to life.\n\nIt would be a frustrating loss of character development if an earlier version of Black Widow appears\n\nThat\u2019s a bigger stretch than even the unlikely theories like cloning and consciousness transfer, given that Red Skull flat-out said her death is irreversible, and Hulk couldn\u2019t bring her back even with the full time-reversing and reality-bending powers of the Infinity Gauntlet. So a time travel solution still seems more likely. But that would be a frustrating echo of what happened with Gamora, just as Natasha\u2019s death was a frustrating echo of Gamora\u2019s more emotionally resonant murder. If Natasha also comes back as an earlier, less developed version of herself, it\u2019ll feel like retreading Gamora\u2019s current plotline. But it\u2019d still give the other Avengers a goal to rally behind in the next sequel. And the early Avengers films, where the characters were just getting to know each other, had the most fun character interactions and casual banter, so it could be enjoyable to take that trip down memory lane.\n\nAs it is now, Endgame leaves Black Widow\u2019s story in a supremely unsatisfying place. Natasha Romanoff was just getting to become the Avengers\u2019 makeshift leader while Captain America was off attending a veterans\u2019 support group. Her reunion with Hawkeye demonstrated how far she had come over the course of a decade of films. Even so, she never got the spotlight, while Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and even the Hulk got their own standalone films, or entire trilogies. She only fared a little better than Hawkeye: not disappearing from the Avengers films altogether, but maintaining a minimal presence at best. She deserves the comeback of her own film, but it\u2019ll be infinitely more satisfying if she also manages a resurrection in the process.", "description": "Will Black Widow\u2019s death in Avengers: Endgame be permanent?
