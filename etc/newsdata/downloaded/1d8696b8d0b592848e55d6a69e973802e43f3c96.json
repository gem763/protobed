Before you book a flight to Japan or put your name on the months-long reservation list at the fanciest restaurant in your city, there's a secret you need to know: you can order your very own Wagyu beef here in the US.\n\nSnake River Farms (SRF) is a premium meat brand that's used at Michelin-starred restaurants and sold at select retailers and online. It sells not Japanese Wagyu, but American Wagyu \u2014 the result of imported Japanese Wagyu cattle crossbred with traditional cattle breeds.\n\nChef and Snake River Farms fan Wolfgang Puck describes American Wagyu as having \"the richness of Japanese beef with lots of marbling,\" but with a flavor that's \"more akin to what we're used to in America.\" He even says that given the choice between the best Japanese Wagyu and American Wagyu, he would \"choose the New York steak from Snake River Farms every time.\"\n\nSnake River Farms\n\nInstead of using the USDA Prime designation, the highest USDA grade for beef, SRF follows the Beef Marbling Standard (BMS), a Japanese marbling scale that the company believes better captures the superior quality of its beef. Its steaks range in BMS from 6 to 12, with 9 to 12 considered excellent (you can find these top-notch, \"Gold Grade\" steaks here).\n\nThe cattle are raised along the high plain of the Snake River in Idaho, where they're fed balanced diets and have space to roam freely. Each piece is wet-aged (marinated in its own juices) for more than three weeks, then hand cut by a butcher and shipped frozen to you.\n\nOn the website, you'll find dozens of American Wagyu beef cuts to buy for a treat-yourself meal or to impress your dinner guests, including porterhouse, filet mignon, ribeye, and prime rib. Even hot dogs and brisket are elevated here, the perfect additions to a gourmet backyard cookout.\n\nSnake River Farms\n\nSRF sent me its American Wagyu Prime Rib Starter Kit ($255), a set designed to help novice cooks make their first prime rib. A simple kit that reinforced how easy it really it is to make a tasty prime rib, it contained a five-pound prime rib, Jacobsen black pepper salt, and a Thermoworks digital thermometer \u2014 quality meat, a generous sprinkling of savory seasoning, and accurate temperature are the only things you need.\n\nEverything arrived in an insulated box (the insulated foam is biodegradable and dissolves in water) with dry ice and a reusable thermal bag, and the prime rib was a little thawed by the time I came home to pick it up.\n\nPrime rib is no doubt a treat I usually only indulge in around the holidays, and a treat this was. The cooking process was a breeze, and I ended up with a huge, flavorful, and juicy prime rib, which I of course also shared with friends.\n\nI don't buy or eat a lot of meat regularly, but when I do, I know I want high-quality stuff. There's no point in skimping or settling, and Snake River Farms is now one of the first online companies I'll turn to, whether I want to buy for myself or for a friend who deserves a good meal.", "description": "Snake River Farms specializes in American Wagyu beef.
