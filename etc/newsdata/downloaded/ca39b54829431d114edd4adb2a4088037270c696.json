He noted that the number of immigrants detained at the border has dropped and praised the management of acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.\n\nKushner acknowledged that his legislation is a starting point but argued it\u2019s important to begin building on a foundational bill concentrated on two areas where Republican lawmakers can largely agree: strengthening border security and shifting the nation to more of a merit-based immigration system.\n\nHis bill does not address more controversial topics such as what to do about immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally at a young age, known as \"Dreamers,\" or E-Verify, a program that enables employers to check on the immigration status of workers.\n\nKushner described his proposals to beef up border security and reform legal immigration as \u201csmart ideas\u201d and predicted if Republicans can unite themselves they will at a minimum be able to win the policy argument ahead of the 2020 election, if not get a bill passed before 2021.\n\nHe said that he has already worked extensively to address GOP concerns, and has specifically addressed 11 issues brought to his attention.\n\nSenate Republicans said the reaction to Kushner's bill, which had been presented in outline form in May, was generally positive, although a few lawmakers raised concerns about missing elements.\n\nSen.

You heard certain suggestions. Nobody is going to agree on everything,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged that Kushner\u2019s plan will have to be expanded.\n\n\u201cPeople do recognize that in order to pass something you\u2019re going to have to eventually be discussing and add different elements, but I\u2019d much rather do one step at a time and concentrate on something we hopefully can agree on,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nSenate Republican Steering Committee Chairman Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeeManufacturing group leads coalition to urge Congress to reauthorize Ex-Im Bank Overnight Defense: GOP grumbles after Trump delays military projects for wall | House panel hints at subpoena for Afghanistan envoy | Kabul bombing raises doubts about Taliban talks Republicans grumble over Trump shifting military funds to wall MORE (R-Utah), who hosted the lunch and introduced Kushner, told colleagues that he had read the bill thoroughly and fully supports it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to talk about what we\u2019re for when it comes to immigration,\u201d Lee told The Hill after the meeting.\n\nJohnson, the Homeland Security panel chairman, said Kushner\u2019s bill would \u201crestore a lot of sanity to the border,\u201d according to sources in the room.\n\nSens.

So it doesn\u2019t deal with DACA,\u201d he said, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected Dreamers from deportation and which Trump moved to end in 2017.\n\nThe lawmaker said the discussion focused on \u201cthe border\u201d and \u201cmerit-based\u201d immigration.\n\n\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t deal with broad, comprehensive immigration,\u201d the senator said.\n\nSen.
