Justin Tipuric and Aaron Wainwright drop out to make way for Ross Moriarty and James Davies. Wales head coach Warren Gatland spoke of the players joking with him after he announced the team. Saying: 'When I told James he was playing and said well done, he replied: you have finally seen the light, have you? He said he was only joking, but I have no problem with a comment like that, not just because I like a bit of banter but it says to me that a player believes in his own ability and thinks he is good enough to be in the side.'", "description": "Replacement James Davies teased Gatland over his selection ahead of Wednesday's game with Fiji", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5bca23c8c5bf551a5fb0d1259024a8d3c6a4b44/0_0_8400_5040/master/8400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de1d4e95bd339ba2e041ea5d153be9fe", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
