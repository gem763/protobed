It seems that most spring days' bring a chilly patch? There is a chill in the air that wasn't around a week ago. Turning to markets, locally we had a solid day on Friday. In the Top 40 there were only three stocks in the red; namely, Sibanye (JO: ), AB Inbev (JO: ) and Richemont (JO: ). Discovery (JO: ) ended the day up 6% thanks to a strong trading update. We will have more on them when they release their results on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nInternationally, tariffs from both China and the US kicked in on the 1 September. These are the tariffs that spooked the market two weeks ago, so the news that they are coming is not new and there is very little reaction from Asian markets this morning. Over the weekend news broke that Trump lied about phone calls between himself and China. The intention was to boost markets. Does it matter to us as investors? Not really; we are long term investors. In years to come, as an investor, you won't care if Trump manipulated share prices or not, you probably won't even remember this occasion.\n\n\n\nOn Friday the closed up 1.56%, the closed up 0.06%, and the closed down 0.13%.\n\nCompany Corner\n\nMichael's Musings\n\n\n\nLast week Woolworths (JO: ) reported results that were disappointing but still better than the market was expecting. The result was the share price shooting up. Here are the numbers, Turnover is up 3.9%, HEPS are down 4.6%, and the dividend has been cut by 20%. The drop in the dividend is because management has decided not to pay a dividend out of their Australian business. It has been tough out there.\n\n\n\nThe shining light in their local operations continues to be their food sales, which saw a 9% increase in sales over the last six months. A pleasant surprise came from their local clothes sales, which were up 8% for the last six months. Having a look at the results, it looks like a tale of two halves. The first six months of their year were tough, but there has been a visible uptick in the second half of their year. Part of the turnaround in the clothing division is due to a repositioning of their product. The CEO Ian Moir said that they \"forgot our core customers\". Their range has now re-adjusted, and they see positive results.\n\n\n\n\n\nA tail wind on the horizon for the business Down-Under will be the completion of renovations to their flagship Sydney store. The renovations started in 2017 and are expected to be completed in March 2020.Having said that, the bad news of lower South African growth coupled with write-offs in the Australian business are reflected in the current share price. Once we see green shoots in the South African economy again and an improvement from their Australian operations, the share price should re-rate to a higher level.\n\nOur 10c Worth\n\nOne thing, from Paul\n\n\n\nWhat's going on in Hong Kong, and what does it mean for our long-term investment interests in that region? What is the outcome that we should hope for, or even actively support?\n\n\n\nToday, Monday, riot police are patrolling Hong Kong's subway ahead of a planned strike that threatens to disrupt transport around the city, following yet another weekend of violence and chaos that stranded travellers at the airport.\n\n\n\nWhen Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, it was with an agreement that it would enjoy special freedoms until 2047. It was hoped (by the British and pro-democracy supporters inside Hong Kong anyway) that China itself would transition to a fully-fledged democracy over that time.\n\n\n\nFive years ago, Beijing announced that it would add more controls to the way the city's leader, the chief executive, was nominated and elected. This latest round of protests arose when the Hong Kong government tried to pass a law to extradite any criminal suspect to China, at China's request.\n\n\n\nThe massive, leaderless resistance movement in Hong Kong feels itself to be a battle to the death with the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. Beijing is using its vast internal propaganda machine to try to convince the public in China that foreign agents and local conspirators are inciting unrest in Hong Kong. There are real concerns that a really violent invasion of Hong Kong by troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is imminent.\n\n\n\nIf you hold Naspers (JO: ) shares, you have a stake in this outcome. That's because Naspers owns over 30% of Tencent, one of China's largest companies. It has headquarters just over the border from Hong Kong in Shenzen (where those PLA tanks and armoured cars are parked, ready to go).\n\n\n\nWe also have investments in US companies which do a lot of business in China, like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) and Nike (NYSE: ). There are others that hope to do much more business there in future, like Visa (NYSE: ) and Tesla.\n\n\n\nAll in all, we would prefer for China to grow economically, and become freer and more integrated into the global economy. We would not be well served if it retreats into a more closed communist dictatorship.\n\n\n\nRead this editorial by Hong Kong activists Joshua Wong and Alex Chow in the New York Times (may require a subscription or log in): The People of Hong Kong Will Not Be Cowed by China.\n\n\n\n\n\nByron's Beats\n\n\n\nDespite all the trade war rhetoric, Tesla seems to be in China's good books. The company secured a big tax exemption which was announced on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese government has agreed to drop a 10% purchase tax on most electric vehicles, including Tesla's entire range. Due to Tesla being an American company there were concerns that they would not be included in the exemption.\n\n\n\nElon Musk has struck a good relationship with the Chinese. The gigafactory being built there is an indication of his faith in the country. It is of course the first production facility that Tesla is building outside the US.\n\n\n\nChina have embraced electric vehicles with open arms. I believe Elon Musk and The Tesla brand have a big following in China already. That country could be huge for Tesla.\n\n\n\nThe share price closed up 1.8% on the news.\n\n\n\n\n\nSigning off\n\nIt is labor day in the US today and labour day in Canada; same same but different. As a result, the markets are going to be rather subdued today. On the data front we have German and UK PMI data, and then new vehicle sales for South Africa. The JSE All-share is higher this morning.\n\n\n\nSent to you by Team Vestact.\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Vestact  covering: S&P 500, Apple Inc, Starbucks Corporation, Visa Inc Class A.
