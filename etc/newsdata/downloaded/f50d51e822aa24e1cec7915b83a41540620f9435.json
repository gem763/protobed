You have one opportunity to make a great first impression.\n\nGive a clear call to action for the reader, and make sure the email includes all necessary contact information in an easily-accessible format.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nDo you want to send an email that gets a response every time? Don't fret. It comes down to the following steps, which I use to achieve cold email success.\n\n1. My email has a fantastic subject line\n\nSubject lines matter, because it's the very first thing your reader will see. You have one opportunity to make a great first impression. So, you need to send an email that has an effective subject line. When crafting your subject line, keep the following questions in mind:\n\nIf you read it, would you want to open the email?\n\nDoes this sound like an interesting email to open?\n\nIs there a clever quote or phrase you can use?\n\nAvoid general statements like \"hello\" and don't ask for something in the subject line. Instead, come across as interesting and charming.\n\n2. My email is clear and easy to read\n\nSome of the worst emails I have read are the ones that take forever to get to the point. Don't you agree? Clarity and time efficiency matter to people who have very busy lives and too little time to do everything they want. If you want a response to your email, make sure you have the following elements in the email:\n\nIntroduce yourself.\n\nIdentify your connection to the reader or purpose for contacting the reader.\n\nClearly state the purpose of your email.\n\nProvide your call to action.\n\nMake it easy for the reader to have a follow up (i.e., schedule a call, meet for lunch/dinner, etc.).\n\nShare your contact information.\n\n\"Thank You\" is never overrated; share your gratitude for the reader's time and attention to the email in a unique way.\n\n3. My call to action is clear\n\nIt should be clear to the reader why you are contacting them. But, does the reader know what is supposed to happen after the email? Are you requesting a call, a meeting or document review? Remember, clarifying the point of the email is one of the most important components of the email. Give them all the tools they need to follow up by suggesting a direction action on their end.\n\n4. My email includes all necessary contact information in an easily-accessible format\n\nHave you ever visited a website and found it incredibly difficult to find the correct email address for the person or organization you searched? Personally, I think this is completely illogical. When you are sending an email and you hide your contact information, how likely will the reader respond to you? It is a professional courtesy to include your contact info in your signature block for every email you send. I would also suggest including your phone number or other contact information earlier in the email, to present it as clearly as possible.\n\n5. My email focuses on how I want the reader to feel\n\nMaya Angelou once said: \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\" Whether you create a format for your emails, or follow the recommendations above, you can't forget to think about how the reader feels after reading your email. Here are questions you want to think about when you craft your emails:\n\nWill the reader be interested in reading the entire email?\n\nDoes the reader have a clear understanding of why they are receiving the email?\n\nDoes your reader feel celebrated and appreciated in the email?\n\nDoes your reader have a reason to respond to the email?\n\nThis Fairygodboss story was originally published on Business Insider May 6, 2019.", "description": "Master the art of the cold email, so your efforts aren't wasted.", "authors": ["Natasha Nurse"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d76b5af2e22af7c606feded?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
