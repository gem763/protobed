They found three suspects, including the 41-year old driver, who was in the process of repainting the truck.\n\nShortly after their arrest, the police made a second breakthrough in the case when one of the suspects borrowed a cellphone from a police officer and called his friends to help cover the crime.\n\nAccording to Hlathi the man told his friend to rush over to his house to remove weapons and explosives that were hidden there.\n\nHowever, police intercepted the message and raided the house before the weapons could be removed.\n\nThey found three AK-47 assault rifles, a discontinued R1 defence force weapon, magazines for all these weapons, more than 130 rounds of ammunition, as well as explosives.\n\nA woman who was at the house at the time was also arrested.\n\nHlathi says the four suspects would appear in the Kanyamazane Magistrate's Court on Friday.\n\nCases of theft, possession of unlicensed firearms and explosives are being investigated.\n\nThe driver was also charged with perjury.", "description": "Just 24 hours after a truck driver from Mbombela claimed that he had been hijacked by three armed robbers, Mpumalanga police recovered the truck, along with another surprise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9488/920f3691393147ada1585ae49315740d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
