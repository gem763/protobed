[KANG JUNG-HYUN, JOINT PRESS CORPS]\n\nAnalysis shows that while rivals President Moon Jae-in and opposition leader Hwang Kyo-ahn are both upping their attendance at public events, they have contrasting strategies for next year\u2019s general election.Moon visited Gunsan, North Jeolla, on Thursday and attended a signing ceremony for a job creation agreement in a new electric car complex in the city. The industrial project was launched to restore the local economy, hit by the closure of a General Motors (GM) plant last year.The event was held in a former GM plant, now used as an electric car factory by MS Group. Moon said 412.2 billion won ($351.7 million) will be invested in the project and 1,900 people will be newly hired by 2022.\u201cGunsan will emerge strong as the mecca of electric vehicles powered by the region\u2019s determination to nurture new industries, and cooperation between labor, management, civil society and government, and government support,\u201d Moon said in the ceremony.Moon\u2019s visit to the southern city marks the sixth time he has participated in an economic event this month alone and his third visit to a region outside Seoul this year. He visited a Samsung display factory in Asan, South Chungcheong, on Oct. 10 and a Hyundai Motor facility in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, five days later.Moon is increasingly hosting or attending economic events. Since April, one year before next year\u2019s general election, he hosted or participated in 33 economic events - or at least one or more a week.The scope of the economic events was also wide. When he visited Songdo, Incheon, in April, he announced a strategy to innovate Korea\u2019s tourism industry.Later that month, he announced a peace economy vision in Goseong, Gangwon. In May, he vowed to support development of bio and health industries during his visit to Osong, North Chungcheong.He visited a hydrogen fueling station in Changwon, South Gyeongsang in June and hosted a meeting with mayors and governors in Busan in July. A job creation ceremony was held in Gumi, North Gyeongsang in July and a visit to Hyundai Mobis factory in Ulsan followed in August.He also visited Muan of South Jeolla in July and Jeonju of North Jeolla in August to announce regional economic visions.Since taking office in May 2017, Moon has visited areas outside Seoul to attend economic activities, but the trips became more frequent after the country was hit with an economic crisis due to Japan\u2019s export restrictions in July. In July, Moon had six economic tours and seven such tours in August.The cities he has visited all coincide with strategic districts for the ruling Democratic Party. It appeared that the president and the ruling party want to concentrate on such areas as their approval ratings plummeted in recent months, particularly since the political turmoil caused by Moon\u2019s appointment of Cho Kuk as justice mister and the scandal-ridden Cho\u2019s subsequent resignation following the prosecution\u2019s probe into his family and a barrage of media reports alleging their corruptions.A presidential aide said the idea was to promote the Moon administration\u2019s efforts for economic recovery. \u201cIf you compare us to the Lee Myung-bak administration, known for its pro-business image, we are making far more economic activities,\u201d he told the JoongAng Ilbo. \u201cMany say the Moon government is anti-corporate, but that is entirely not true. We are actually business-friendly.\u201dThe Blue House also insists that the country is doing well, despite various warning signs in economic indexes. Due to global economic slowdowns, the average price of an 8-gigabit DDR4 DRAM, a benchmark price for the category, plummeted to $2.94 from the average of $8.2 last year, a Blue House official noted, adding that semiconductors comprise 20 percent of Korea\u2019s exports. And yet, the country managed to maintain over $30,000 gross national income per capita, he said.He also stressed that Korea\u2019s economic growth is the second highest after the United States among the seven countries in the so-called 30-50 club, or those with per capita gross national income surpassing $30,000 and a population of over 50 million.Experts, however, say the policies must change, instead of Moon\u2019s frequent participation in economic events. \u201cThe government is spending state budgets to create jobs for people in the over-sixties age group, but how much longer will it last?\u201d said Kang Sung-jin, professor of economics at Korea University. \u201cActually, the government is preparing many bills that will actually strengthen regulations.\u201dSung Tae-yoon, an economics professor of Yonsei University, also expressed concerns. \u201cThe growth rate was 3.2 percent in 2017, but it dropped over 1.2 percentage-points over the past two years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means nearly a 40-percent plunge. This is a serious crisis.\u201dIn contrast to Moon, Chairman Hwang of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party (LKP) is concentrating his activities on political events.On Thursday, Hwang took a helicopter to a military post on the northeastern island of Maldo in Ganghwa, Incheon. The island is in close proximity to Hambak Island, the location of a recent territorial dispute between the two Koreas.The visit also followed Hwang\u2019s announcement of the LKP\u2019s conservative vision on foreign affairs and national security earlier in the morning.After receiving a report from a military official, Hwang said that the North has violated the inter-Korean military agreement by placing military installations on Hambak Island. \u201cIt is necessary for the South to demand the North to remove the facilities, but the Moon administration is doing nothing,\u201d Hwang said.Hwang\u2019s visit to the military unit took place after military tensions between the two Koreas escalated. During a parliamentary audit session earlier this month, South Korean Marine Corps Commandant Lee Seung-do told lawmakers that \u201cWe have a plan to use the 2nd Marine Division\u2019s firepower to level the island in the event of a war\u201d to counter the North\u2019s radar facilities on Hambak Island.In response, North Korea issued a threatening rhetoric, saying the South must not forget the \u201cYeonpyeong Island shelling\u201d in 2010.\u201cMoon\u2019s North Korea policy is practically dead,\u201d said an LKP official. \u201cThe people need a new model of an opposition party.\u201dHwang started his political activity in August. After completing a national tour in May, he has refrained from making public appearances, but Moon\u2019s nomination of Cho as the justice minister in August triggered him to lead propaganda events.After hosting a massive anti-Moon administration protest in Gwanghwamun on Aug. 24, he hosted a total of 13 rallies. Most of them took place in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, but he also visited Busan, Daegu and other cities to host the demonstrations.As youngsters who had endorsed the Moon administration for its pledge of \u201cfairness\u201d withdrew their support, Hwang also tried to communicate with them to expand the party\u2019s traditional support basis of older voters.Last month, he hosted a meeting with a group of voters in their 20s at the National Assembly. Young YouTube content creators were also invited to the LKP headquarters.Earlier this month, Hwang visited Seoul Federation of Teachers\u2019 Associations and Pukyong National University in Busan in two separate events to connect with younger voters.BY Kim JUN-YOUNG, WI MOON-HEE [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/25195353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
