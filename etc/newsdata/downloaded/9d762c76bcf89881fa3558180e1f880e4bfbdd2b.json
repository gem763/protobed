County Sheriff Alex Villanueva sounded defensive as they answered questions about why it took so long to bring charges against Buck.\n\nLacey, who returned a $100 donation from Buck after he was implicated in the overdoses, said they could not make the case until the victim who survived fled and called 911.\n\n\u201cThe surviving witness\u2019 statements gave us the break we needed,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cWe needed someone live, willing to come to court and be cross-examined.\u201d\n\nShe insisted that L.A. investigators followed every lead given to them by activists but said they were never able to gather enough admissible evidence to charge him with the two deaths under state law.\n\n\u201cWe interviewed every person that was brought before us. They didn\u2019t talk to us. They lawyered up. We made an effort to talk to every person who witnessed something,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, the feds say they were able to identify 10 additional victims of Buck, nine of whom said he coerced or physically forced them to be injected with meth.\n\nHanna said investigators spoke to a man who previously lived with Buck. \u201cThis man said Mr. Buck injected him with methamphetamine almost daily. He experienced two overdoses that required hospitalization,\u201d Hanna said.\n\nThe state charges that were lodged in connection with the third overdose\u2014battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine, and maintaining a drug house\u2014carried up to four years in prison.\n\nThe feds, Lacey said, had \u201cmore options\u201d and stiffer penalties at their disposal. The federal charge of distribution resulting in death\u2014which could result in a life sentence\u2014doesn\u2019t have a state counterpart, Hanna said.\n\nThe court papers Lacey filed on Wednesday describe Buck as a predator who put his sexual urges before basic respect for human life.\n\nThey say he lured a parade of vulnerable men to his apartment with the promise of money, drugs or even just shelter\u2014and got off on injecting them with drugs during porn-fueled sex marathons.\n\nPolice found hundreds of photos of men in what they called \u201ccompromising positions\u201d and said it would be only a matter of time before another one overdosed unless Buck was stopped.\n\n\u201cBuck is clearly a predator with no regard for human life,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a filing. \u201cHis behavior is malicious and beyond reckless.\u201d\n\n\u2014Tarpley Hitt reported from Los Angeles and Tracy Connor reported from New York", "description": "The charge stems from the death of Gemmel Moore in 2017.
