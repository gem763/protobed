Poland does have those key fundamentals: it has the GDP, it has the educated workforce, it has the high disposable income, it did come from a low base and it\u2019s building up quickly.\u201d\n\nInvestors from China, the Philippines and Singapore have reportedly elbowed their way alongside the traditional German investment crowd, and the Australians are getting in on the action.\n\nRF CorVal and Roberts Constructions signed a deal with Poland\u2019s Reino Partners recently to invest in commercial and residential projects, via a 50-50 jointly owned fund set up in Luxembourg that can also take on additional investors.\n\nThe vehicle can also buy other development and property services companies, which Reino can operate.\n\nIn the memorandum of understanding for the venture, the fund is described as RF CorVal\u2019s first major European foray: \u201cCooperation with the Issuer [Reino] will be the first investment project of unprecedented size and scale executed by RF CorVal in Europe.\u201d\n\nIn August, Cromwell bought out the investors in its closed-ended Polish Retail Fund, which holds seven assets worth about \u20ac600 million \u2013 part of a broader \u20ac1 billion portfolio that also includes office (26 per cent), logistics (9 per cent) and industrial (3 per cent).\n\n\u201cFrom a structuring point of view it\u2019s a slightly different structure going forward but effectively it\u2019s replacing existing investors with new to complete the business plan,\" Mr Cotterell says. \"It\u2019s the soft-marketing period at this stage, it\u2019s not formal at this stage. We can have an opportunity to grow this vehicle, there are more opportunities in this market.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRetail is unusual in Poland \u2013 and to some extent elsewhere in the continent\u2019s east \u2013 because the malls aren\u2019t struggling to the same degree as in Western Europe.\n\nMany Polish cities were flattened during World War II, and so they don\u2019t tend to have retail \u201chigh streets\u201d \u2013 Poles are thus accustomed to shopping in plazas.\n\n\u201cThey as a culture go to shopping malls, they spend their money that way, that is how they do their spare time,\u201d Mr Cotterell says.\n\nBroader set of experiences\n\nThere are some challenges. New mall development is at its lowest levels in a decade, so the focus is on creating a broader set of experiences within existing malls, and expanding their size in smaller cities. Governmental curbs on Sunday trading have not helped.\n\nBut the online threat is not as daunting in Poland: only 7 per cent of purchases are made over the internet.\n\n\u201cThat will grow, but not to the same extent we\u2019ve seen elsewhere, and it will take longer. So we think fundamentally you will get the rental growth and you will get the demand still through these centres,\u201d Mr Cotterell says.\n\nLast month, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield rebranded its Arkadia mall in Warsaw, the country\u2019s largest, as a Westfield centre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOffice investment also looks attractive, as more companies relocate back-office functions and research and development to Poland, to take advantage of a well-educated, multilingual workforce that comes a lot cheaper than in Berlin, Paris or London.\n\nThere\u2019s potential supply to meet demand, as Warsaw has plenty of under-utilised land. Factories that were built very centrally in the communist period now lie abandoned.\n\nThe capital has about 800,000sq m under construction \u2013 due for completion by the end of 2021 \u2013 and the vacancy rate is heading down below 8 per cent.\n\n\u201cIn Warsaw, you\u2019ve got to be a little bit careful. There is a big supply line, there is a lot of land in Warsaw, because of the history,\u201d Mr Cotterell says. But \u201cyou get a lot of these developments fully let, or at least 90 per cent, by the time they\u2019re finished \u2013 so it\u2019s not oversupplying the market which is always the fear when you see that sort of dynamics.\u201d\n\nThe nationalist government, which is expected to be re-elected on Sunday, has been making discouraging noises about the level of foreign investment in Poland. But Mr Cotterell is comfortable with the inflow.\n\n\u201cYou will always have some sort of discussions around politics in Poland, but all our experience has been that the property market continues to keep going,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFrom what we see, it\u2019s still strong liquidity, it\u2019s still strong international investors in that market, they\u2019re always the gauge: if people see the political risk as being high, you will have the international investors step aside; but they are still there wanting to invest and don\u2019t see that as a key risk going forward.\u201d", "description": "Australian property companies are seeking to cash in on Poland\u2019s heady 28-year run of economic growth. \u201cThere is incredible energy here,\" Warsaw mayor Rafat Trzaskowski says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/75d518f9e14f946028ead5b94223a28133dadb28", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
