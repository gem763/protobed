September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cSomeone as big, awkward, ungainly, unpredictable, it's not an easy guy to make a game plan for. It really isn't. Particularly because he hasn't shown any weaknesses.\n\n\u201cHe has shown he has a chin against one of the hardest punches ever as Wilder hit him with a huge shot twice. A right hand, then on the way down a left hook which should have well and truly put him to sleep.\n\n\u201cHe has proven he has a world class chin. He is ticking a lot of the boxes. I feel that he is young enough to really make a legacy. He can go on \u2013 if he continues to win these big fights \u2013 he can go down as one of the greats.\n\n\u201cThe fact he has already beaten Wladimir Klitschko, the fact he has beaten pretty much every man he has faced means he is going down that route.\n\n\u201cHe has done everything humanly possibly other than getting the win against Deontay Wilder but Lennox lewis got a draw aganst Evander Holyfield and that hasn't harmed his legacy \u2013 most people put him top five or three of all-time. I think he is in the middle of his career.\n\n\u201cI think he has seven or eight years of good fights ahead and I definitely feel you cannot judge a fighter on his greatness compared to other retired fighters whilst they're still active.\u201d\n\nBut Haye warned Fury not to take the challenge of 6ft 6in underdog Wallin too lightly just three months after the Brit demolished Tom Schwarz inside two rounds.\n\n\u201cHopefully Otto will ask a few more questions than Schwarz,\u201d Haye added. \u201cThe fact he is a southpaw and undefeated maybe he will.\n\n\u201cI haven't scrutinised his record but there are no names there that really stand out. But that doesn't mean he hasn't fought anyone. \u201cJust because someone has a record that doesn't jump out at you doesn't mean they're not good. A lot of people make the mistake of saying 'I've never heard of him so he's no good'.\n\n\u201cThey said the same about Andy Ruiz, 'Who is he? Look at the state of him and we were all proved wrong and eating humble pie'. I never write off a heavyweight.\n\n\u201cAnyone who is 6ft 6in, long reach, undefeated record he's a threat.\u201d\n\nTyson Fury takes on Otto Wallin live on BT Sport Box Office this Saturday.
