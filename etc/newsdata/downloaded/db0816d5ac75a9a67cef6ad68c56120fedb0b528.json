The decision to sit both comes despite defensive end Robert Quinn being suspended the first two games for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancers.\n\nWhile Charlton had a solid preseason coming off two mostly disappointing seasons, Hill struggled from the beginning of training camp and couldn't find his way into the rotation. Hill mostly came off the bench in his final season at Central Florida, raising questions about his relationship with the coaching staff.\n\nZiggy Ansah's debut with the Seattle Seahawks was delayed as the new defensive end was inactive for the opener against Cincinnati.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnsah had practiced all week, but was a late addition to the injury report on Friday listed with a shoulder injury, and was listed as questionable. Ansah missed most of training camp while recovering from offseason shoulder surgery and a groin injury picked up during his rehab.\n\nGuard Mike Iupati (calf) was active for Seattle after going through his first full practice in more than a month on Friday.\n\nTackle Cordy Glenn had already been ruled out by Cincinnati, meaning Andre Smith is expected to start at left tackle.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers kicker Michael Badgley is inactive after suffering a groin injury during Friday's practice. Ty Long, who was signed during the offseason, will handle both punting and placekicking duties against Indianapolis. Long handled both the past two seasons with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League.\n\nThe Cardinals are going to be thin on the offensive line without starting right tackle Marcus Gilbert (knee) and backups Lamont Gaillard and Brett Toth against Detroit.\n\nWide receiver Michael Crabtree won't play after being signed by the Cardinals on Aug. 21. The Lions are without starting linebacker Jarrad Davis (ankle) after his injury in a preseason game two weeks ago.\n\n---\n\nInactives for Sunday's games:\n\nNY GIANTS-DALLAS\n\nGiants: QB Alex Tanney, RB Paul Perkins, G Chad Slade, T Eric Smith, WR Darius Slayton (hamstring), TE Garrett Dickerson (quad).\n\nCowboys: S Darian Thompson (ankle), S Donovan Wilson (ankle), LB Luke Gifford (ankle), C Adam Redmond, G Brandon Knight, DT Trysten Hill, DE Taco Charlton.\n\n---\n\nCINCINNATI-SEATTLE\n\nBengals: DE Andrew Brown, DE Jordan Willis, RB Trayveon Williams T Cordy Glenn, QB Jake Dolegala, WR A.J.
