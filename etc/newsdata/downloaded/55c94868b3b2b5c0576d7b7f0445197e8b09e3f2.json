They\u2019re a no-brainer for anyone who isn\u2019t trapped in the Apple ecosystem, and for Apple users who value sound quality, fit, and noise cancelling.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nSony recently released its $230 WF-1000XMS wireless noise-cancelling earbuds, and after trying them, I\u2019d be pretty upset if I had recently spent between $160 to $200 on a pair of AirPods.\n\nYes, the WF-1000XM3s cost more, but you\u2019re getting much better sound, a better fit, slightly better battery life, and last but not least, really good noise cancelling.\n\nYou don\u2019t get the AirPods\u2019 fancy auto-pairing connectivity with Apple devices, and I wish Sony made it easier to switch the connection to different devices. Still, if you value sound quality, fit, and noise cancelling, and you\u2019re willing to spend over $200, the Sony WF-1000XM3s should be at the very top of your list.\n\nCheck out the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless noise-cancelling earbuds:\n\nSony\u2019s WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds have a sleek, more-or-less compact charging case. It\u2019s larger than the AirPods case and won\u2019t fit quite as well in a pocket, but it\u2019s been living in my backpack\u2019s side pocket for weeks now without any trouble.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe case charges via USB-C and keeps a charge of up to 24 hours. It charges the earbuds quickly and I\u2019ve barely had to charge the case. But it\u2019s also lacking wireless charging, which is a shame.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nSony claims the earbuds last about six hours on a single charge, which is good for earphones that are this small and portable. Battery life was never an issue, except for one day when I forgot to put them back into their charging case when I stopped using them at work. I got the low battery signal during my commute home, charged the earbuds for about 10 minutes, and I was good to go again.\n\ncaption The earbuds are set to turn off automatically after five minutes when you take them out of your ears. You can check the battery level in the Sony Headphones app, as well as change settings on the earbuds. source Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe earbuds present themselves nicely in the case. They\u2019re easy to remove and replace. When you replace the earbuds into the case, they magnetically \u2014 and satisfyingly \u2014 snap into their enclosures.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThere\u2019s no quick-pairing like you\u2019d find on Apple\u2019s AirPods. You have to go through the old fashioned way of Bluetooth pairing, which is fine. They reconnect to your previously connected devices quickly and without any fuss the moment you place the earbuds in your ears.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nImportantly, the earbuds themselves sound amazing. After tweaking the sound settings in the Sony Headphones app, I got exactly the sound I wanted out of them. They have strong bass, and they sound rich and clear. It\u2019s amazing such tiny things can make such big \u2014 and good \u2014 sound.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThese things also have active noise cancellation, and their in-ear design blocks out some noise, too. That combination makes for similar noise-cancelling performance as larger over-ear headphones.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nYou can tap the sensors on the earbuds to control playback, like pause, play the next track, or play the previous track. They pause automatically when you take them off, too. There\u2019s no volume control, but controls are going to be limited on such small earbuds. If you\u2019re interested, you can tap an earbud to summon Google Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa, too.\n\ncaption One tap for pause/play, two taps for next track, and three taps to go to the beginning of the song. To go to the previous track, you have to triple-tap once, and then again. source Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nMy biggest complaint is that it\u2019s not as easy as it should be to switch the connection to a different device. Still, it\u2019s not difficult, either.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe WF-1000XM3s don\u2019t have the Bluetooth Multipoint technology that lets you connect the earphones to more than one device at a time. To switch the connection from my smartphone to my laptop, I have to put the earbuds into pairing mode and connect the earbuds manually through my device\u2019s settings.\n\nPutting the earbuds into pairing mode isn\u2019t difficult. You tap-and-hold the sensors on both earbuds for a few seconds until you hear the pairing prompt. It looks like your plugging your ears with your fingers, which might look a little odd to passers by. But who cares what other people think, right? I\u2019m pairing here!\n\nIt\u2019s not the worst thing. I\u2019m willing to tolerate this slight complication in exchange for great sound and battery life. If Sony added Multipoint to its headphones, they would be near-perfect.\n\nJust in case you\u2019re looking for a workout pair of headphones, these aren\u2019t them. The WF-1000XM3 are not water-resistant, so sweat could be an issue.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe Sony WF-1000XM3 are a no-brainer for anyone who wants small, wireless earbuds like Apple\u2019s AirPods, but who care about sound, fit, and noise cancelling. But for Apple users who prefer seamless connectivity and the Apple ecosystem, the WF-1000XM3s might not do the trick.", "description": "Business Insider - The Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds fit and sound better than Apple's AirPods.
