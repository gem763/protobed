Now he could bring about his political demise.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman, a tough-talking former bouncer, appears to hold the key to either Mr. Netanyahu or his rival, Benny Gantz, taking power after an election Tuesday that yielded no clear winner. Both men now need Mr. Lieberman\u2019s support to assemble a majority of 61 seats or more in the 120-seat parliament, the Knesset.\n\nIn the past, Mr. Lieberman would have thrown his support to his former boss, Mr. Netanyahu, who plucked the Soviet-born immigrant from obscurity in 1996 and made him the director general of the prime minister\u2019s office. But for this election, Mr. Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beiteinu party ran on its own and campaigned for a broad unity government among his own party, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and Mr. Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party. His goal is to push from power the religious parties Mr. Netanyahu has depended on for his past majorities.\n\n\u201cAs we said throughout the election campaign, we will only sit in a broad, liberal nationalist government that will consist of three parties\u2014Yisrael Beiteinu, Likud, and Blue and White,\u201d Mr. Lieberman wrote in a statement on his Facebook Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMr. Netanyahu on Wednesday vowed to press on and force Mr. Lieberman\u2019s hand, saying he wouldn\u2019t give up on forming a right-wing government with the religious parties. But the chance to form a government will ultimately fall to whomever Mr. Lieberman chooses, political analysts said.\n\nMr. Lieberman \u201cput himself in the middle place between left and right as the one who decides what happens,\u201d said Abraham Diskin, a political-science professor at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University.\n\nThe 61-year-old Mr. Lieberman has developed a reputation as a shrewd operator, climbing close to the top of Israeli politics after emigrating to Israel from Moldova in 1978 and working as a bouncer in Jerusalem. He has been deputy prime minister, minister of foreign affairs, minister of transportation and most recently minister of defense.\n\nMuch of his political career has been defined by his hard-line stance against Arab citizens of Israel and the Palestinians. Support for his party, Yisrael Beiteinu or Israel Is Our Home, has historically come from Israel\u2019s large Russian-speaking population. He is also known for shifting his political allegiances and causing political trouble for Mr. Netanyahu, having exited early from several of his coalitions in the past.\n\nMr. Lieberman is a main reason Israel had its second election in five months. After Mr. Netanyahu won the ballot in April, Mr. Lieberman withdrew his support from the prime minister over his alliances with ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties that give Mr. Netanyahu their unwavering support in exchange for government funding of religious seminaries and government support for their continued authority over marriage, divorce, and observance of the Sabbath.\n\nMr. Lieberman\u2019s bet appears to have paid off. He looks to have increased his seats from five to eight in the Knesset, putting Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing, religious bloc precarious short of a majority.\n\nSome voters were drawn to Mr. Lieberman\u2019s call for separating the Israeli government from the Jewish law supported by the ultraorthodox community, a growing demographic that stands apart from the country\u2019s largely secular Jewish society. Many Israelis resent how the ultraorthodox have wielded their power to restrict public transport on the Sabbath, set marital laws and avoid military service.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very able politician who made a great electoral move and understood the situation better than anyone else has,\u201d Mr. Diskin said.\n\nOthers saw voting for Mr. Lieberman as a way to thwart Mr. Netanyahu, even as Mr. Lieberman has played down his rivalry with the prime minister, saying he wouldn\u2019t rule out sitting with him in government.\n\n\u201cThis is not a personal issue,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday morning.\n\nBut the conditions Mr. Lieberman has posed for this unity government are difficult: The coalition must exclude the Arab parties often associated with Mr. Gantz\u2019s bloc as well as the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s camp.\n\nThat considerably narrows options for cobbling together a majority, especially since Mr. Gantz has vowed not to serve in government with Mr. Netanyahu if the prime minister is indicted next month on corruption charges, which he denies.", "description": "The politician who emerged Tuesday as a possible kingmaker for Israel\u2019s next government was once a trusted ally of Benjamin Netanyahu.
