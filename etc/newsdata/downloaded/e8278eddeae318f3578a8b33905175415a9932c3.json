The more tickets sold, the more revenue for the carrier. But the airline might also add seats to smaller planes, it said in its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday.\n\nOther airlines like American and Delta have already been using this strategy.\n\nStocks in this Article UAL UNITED AIRLINES HLDG. $89.46 -0.24 (-0.27%)\n\n\u201cWe have large hubs in big cities across the country, and because of that, we should be the airline with the highest gauge,\u201d United President Scott Kirby said. \u201cBut at this point, we\u2019re not. In fact, United is seven-to-eight years behind our large competitors in gauge growth with approximately 13 percent fewer seats per domestic departure compared to Delta.\u201d\n\nAdding seats per departure decreases unit costs, travel-website Skift explained. That\u2019s because \u201cwhat the industry calls \u2018cost\u2019 is not a true measure of spending.\u201d\n\nInstead, many airlines use the cost-per-available-seat-mile metric, which is roughly equivalent to how much they spend to fly one seat for one mile. \u201cWhen an airline adds capacity on a flight,\u201d the site said, \u201cby adding seats on an existing plane, or substituting a larger aircraft, this cost metric comes down, even if the carrier\u2019s total spending does not.\u201d\n\nAlso, carriers generally don\u2019t include fuel in that metric, so even if the price of oil spikes, for example, airlines can still compare costs from quarter to quarter or year over year.\n\nUnited has already added seats to most of its fleet and expects to raise its seat count by seven. But experts say the plan to cut costs won\u2019t happen overnight. In the short-term, cost could rise. The airline said on the call that costs per available seat mile will tick up 3 percent in the fourth quarter. For 2019, overall, costs will settle about 1.2 percent higher.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, United has been flying less as it grounded all Boeing 737 Max planes following two deadly crashes linked to the jet\u2019s mechanical issues. Still, the airline expects to grow, and its stock has been an indication of that: It\u2019s up 7 percent on the year.\n\nThe carrier\u2019s performance puts it \u201cahead of pace\u201d to meet its per-share earnings goal by 2020, United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz, said in a press statement.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFor the third quarter, the airline\u2019s jumped almost 23 percent to more than $1.02 billion. Revenue per available seat mile was up almost 2 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud of the cost control we\u2019ve delivered, and will continue to deliver through next year,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Gerry Laderman said on the call. \u201cWe expect the three-year compound annual growth rate for non-fuel unit costs to be just 0.3 percent, which would be a remarkable and industry-leading achievement.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The carrier\u2019s performance puts it \u201cahead of pace\u201d to meet its per-share earnings goal by 2020, United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz, said in a press statement.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
