Biden and his son Hunter, has united Democrats on Capitol Hill and is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry launched by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week.\n\nThe flurry of subpoenas shows how quickly the Democrats have escalated their impeachment inquiry. So far, the three committees have subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, scheduling depositions for State Department staffers, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney.\n\nWednesday\u2019s action marks the first time Democrats have threatened to subpoena the White House.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 subpoena comes on the same day Steve Linick, the State Department\u2019s inspector general, is scheduled to brief lawmakers about \u201curgent\u201d material he says is relevant to the Ukraine investigation.\n\nDetails on what Mr. Linick intends to reveal remain scant.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
