Bush defeated Al Gore in 2000. It was then that the mass media and the Democratic Party decided they would never again accept defeat.\n\nTemper tantrums led to the attempted thwarting of the election results. After a painful period of recounting votes and figuring out what to do with \u201cpregnant chads,\u201d Mr. Bush was declared the winner and the dust eventually settled.\n\nOnly the media and a few sore losers failed to move on and instead tried to delegitimize Mr. Bush as our rightful president. Remember how they moaned and whined, \u201cNot my president?\u201d Thankfully, even the Democrats in Congress eventually largely abandoned their whining and started doing their jobs.\n\nThis time, the \u201clamestream\u201d media so hates Donald Trump that they committed to torching his victory from the moment he won.\n\nThey were so arrogantly certain that Hillary Clinton would win that they nearly lost their minds, behaving like a spoiled child on Christmas morning when he doesn\u2019t get the gift he demanded.\n\nCouple this with their absolute hatred of Mr. Trump for repeatedly calling out their bigoted coverage and it\u2019s obvious why they want to destroy him.\n\nWith the churning of the waters in story after story, 24/7, 365 days a year, congressional Democrats repeatedly have tried to turn it into a tsunami of impeachment but always end up flailing in the surf.\n\nWhy are leftists absolutely consumed by hatred for Mr. Trump? Because he is obliterating the entirety of their radical agenda \u2014 and doing it with glee.\n\nThe president\u2019s hilariously blunt tweets and thumbing of his nose at the rules of the swamp have gotten under their thin skin like bed bugs, and it\u2019s driving them absolutely bonkers.\n\nNancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, et al are self destructing before our very eyes. As they break numerous laws regarding the handling of classified information, trample the Constitution and holler like hound dogs, Mr. Trump brilliantly feeds their madness as he begs: \u201cPlease don\u2019t throw me in that briar patch!\u201d\n\nIf they succeed in tossing him into the dreaded brambles of impeachment, Mr. Trump and the massive throngs of hard-working Americans that support him will have the last laugh as he scurries off to another victory next November.\n\nStill, even though the disgusting behavior of the feckless Democrats in Congress is only serving to bring more supporters to the president, their continual efforts to undo the 2016 election are dangerous to our democratic republic.\n\nMore than 120 conservative leaders who actually care about the Constitution just released a memo denouncing \u201cthe efforts by congressional Democrats to abuse the impeachment process for blatantly political ends.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads, in part: \u201cThe impeachment process is only meant to be used when there is serious misconduct by a government official \u2014 not when Members of Congress hate the president personally, and don\u2019t like his policies.\u201d (Read the entire memo at conservativeactionproject.com.)\n\nThe congressional leftists have wasted every day since the president took office conducting bogus investigations instead of doing their jobs as legislators.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump has spent each day working with allies to secure victory after victory on behalf of the American people. Vice President Mike Pence recently mentioned a few:\n\n\u2981 Largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.\n\n\u2981 Massive deregulation.\n\n\u2981 All-time stock market highs.\n\n\u2981 Economic policies that enabled the creation of 6.5 million new jobs.\n\n\u2981 Lowest overall unemployment rate in 51 years, and lowest ever for African Americans and Hispanic Americans.\n\n\u2981 Wages rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade, with the largest gains in blue collar jobs.\n\nMr. Trump also has championed the defunding of Planned Parenthood, led the first ever U.N. summit on religious liberty, rebuilt America\u2019s military and moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nOh my, the list of blessings goes on and on \u2014 each one loathed by leftists. Their impeachment schmeachment only proves that they loathe nearly everything good about America too.\n\n\u2981 Rebecca Hagelin can be reached at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
