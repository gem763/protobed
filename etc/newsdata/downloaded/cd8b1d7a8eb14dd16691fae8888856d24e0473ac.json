Peter Strathern detected a bit more understanding, saying that an immigration aide who attended that session with Forsythe was \u201calmost in tears\u201d at one point.\n\n\u201cThey said they were very sorry about what had happened to Michelle,\u201d Peter Strathern said. He asked why no effort was made to get input from the families or even to notify them before or after the men were resettled in Australia. \u201cPrivacy\u201d was the mantra Forsythe and her aide offered in return.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t normally do that, they said. They said, because of privacy reasons, they don\u2019t do that,\u201d Strathern said. \u201cThere were certain things they could not tell us.\u201d\n\nThe two Rwandans \u2014 Leonidas Bimenyimana and Gregoire Nyaminani \u2014 were charged with first-degree murder over the massacre and faced the possibility of the death penalty in a U.S. court until a judge threw out their confessions in 2006, citing evidence the men, former Hutu fighters, were tortured while in Rwandan government custody. The men then fought their deportation from the U.S. to Rwanda, arguing that they could be persecuted or killed if returned to the Tutsi-led government there.\n\nPOLITICO reported earlier this year that the stalemate over the Rwandans was broken after they became part of discussions that led to a broader, immigration-related deal between the U.S. and Australia. In that pact, the U.S. agreed to help solve a much-larger scale immigration problem for Australia by accepting as many as 1,250 migrants intercepted at sea and held for years in offshore detention centers that became a political albatross for multiple Australian governments.\n\nDue to persistent secrecy on the part of both the U.S. and Australian governments, precisely how the Rwandan men fit into that deal remains unclear, but last November the two were released from an immigration detention center in Virginia and flown to Australia.\n\nThe transfer came nearly two years after then-Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told President Donald Trump that Australia had agreed to take in people the Obama administration was \u201cvery keen on getting out of the United States,\u201d according to a transcript leaked to the Washington Post. Trump initially balked at keeping Obama\u2019s pledge to take in the migrants Australia was seeking to offload, but was eventually persuaded to stand by the deal.\n\nOne mystery the victims\u2019 families have sought to unravel is how the Rwandan men passed a so-called \u201ccharacter test\u201d that is supposed to be part of Australia\u2019s screening process for refugees and asylum applicants.\n\nAlthough the men denied involvement in the massacre and the dismissal of the murder charges meant they were never convicted of any crime, the victims' families questioned how the pair were deemed of good character since they admitted to fighting on behalf of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, or ALIR \u2014 a Hutu militia linked to numerous atrocities, which is still formally listed as a terrorist group by the U.S.\n\nBoth families said Forsythe insisted that a full character investigation on the two men was conducted and they passed, although she would not provide details.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they actually passed the test,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI think somebody\u2019s done a dodgy back-pocket, back handed deal to get these guys out of the States. I think it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nBoth families said Australian officials offered up a previously unheard explanation for taking in the former Rwandan fighters: a heightened obligation on Australia\u2019s part to address refugee cases involving Rwanda because that nation, like Australia, is part of the Commonwealth. (Rwanda joined the group formerly known as the British Commonwealth in 2009, despite having no colonial ties to the United Kingdom.)\n\n\u201cThe lady mentioned that Rwanda is part of the Commonwealth,\u201d said Pauline Jackson, Avis\u2019 mother. \u201cTurns out Commonwealth countries take people from Rwanda on humanitarian grounds if they\u2019re part of families who were in the genocide. I think it\u2019s our back door for, kind of, criminals.\u201d\n\nAsked about the meetings with the families, a spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Home Affairs Department offered only a generic statement.\n\n\u201cAustralia works with our closest partners \u2014 the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand, as an active participant in addressing global migration challenges,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Department of Home Affairs observes privacy requirements and does not disclose the details of its conversations.\u201d\n\nAustralian officials did not respond directly to questions about their discussions with New Zealand on the resettlement, nor about how Rwanda\u2019s commonwealth status impacted the decision to admit the two men.\n\nQueries from Rhonda Avis\u2019 family to the New Zealand government did yield one new bit of information. While Australia doesn\u2019t appear to have told their long-time Kiwi allies in advance about the deal, officials did notify their New Zealand counterparts before POLITICO broke news of the transfers.\n\nNew Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters told Jackson in a letter last month that New Zealand officials \u201cwere informed about this matter in March 2019, after resettlement had occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew Zealand did not play a role in Australia\u2019s decision in this case. However, we are confident that Australia has a robust screening process for refugees,\u201d Peters wrote.\n\nWhile not addressing any specifics, he assured Jackson that anyone associated with groups involved in war crimes could be denied visas if deemed \u201ca risk to New Zealand\u2019s international reputation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Strathern said his family is still struggling to come to terms with Australia\u2019s decision, despite disagreeing with it and feeling that many of their questions remain unanswered.\n\n\u201cWe told them how we felt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t particularly happy with the outcome. But we\u2019ve been down this track and so, we\u2019ve sort of accepted that that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bb/d6/4f1309324b41bc9079deecd35ec0/190930-australia-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
