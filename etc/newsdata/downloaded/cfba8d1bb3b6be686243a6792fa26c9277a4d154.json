But in 1910, when Mexico was ruled by dictator Porfirio Diaz, illustrator Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada sketched the image of La Catrina as a tool for social satire.\n\nShe dons an oversized hat considered haute couture at a time when elite Mexican women copied Paris fashion trends and powdered their faces to appear more European.\n\nThe implication was that the extravagance of a few who were accumulating vast wealth in the era was killing others.\n\nThe dictator was deposed at the start of the Mexican revolution, while the skeletal dame became etched in popular culture.\n\nMexico's two-day holiday to honour the dead traditionally begins on November 1, All Saints' Day on the Catholic calendar.", "description": "Mexicans dressed as elegant skeletons took to the streets of their capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/12/08/1000x563_cmsv2_9806f4ab-0e76-557e-8b89-9a9bdba91cba-4261208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
