The Results Are Incredible.", "language": "en", "text": "Following a successful cleanup effort in Baltimore, conservative activist Scott Presler and a team of volunteers helped clean up 50 tons of trash in Los Angeles this weekend over a nine-hour period.\n\nIn a video showing the final result of a completely cleaned up homeless camp, Presler said it was \u201cone of the proudest moments of my life.\u201d\n\nPresler pointed out that if this is what could be done in a matter of hours with volunteers, \u201cimagine what we could do with the millions California receives in taxpayer $.\u201d\n\nHe also wondered why he was there and not elected officials.\n\nIt\u2019s almost 9 a.m. & we\u2019re removing waste from a homeless camp in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nWhy is an outsider from Northern Virginia here & not California elected leadership? #LosAngelesCleanup pic.twitter.com/yqW2pxKA3c \u2014 #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) September 21, 2019\n\nThis is one of the proudest moments of my life.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the day we cleaned up a homeless camp in LA. #LosAngelesCleanup pic.twitter.com/jTetowuLAu \u2014 #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) September 21, 2019\n\nWe cleaned up 50 tons of trash in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nYes, 50 tons.\n\n\n\nIn 9 hours. #LosAngelesCleanup \u2014 #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) September 21, 2019\n\nThe Los Angeles cleanup was an act of love. #SundayMorning pic.twitter.com/qF66DXbfc4 \u2014 #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) September 22, 2019\n\nIf a team of 200+ volunteers\n\n\n\ncan clean up 50 tons of trash in 9 hours with no support from the city,\n\n\n\nimagine what we could do with the millions California receives in taxpayer $.\n\n\n\nWhy am I here & elected officials aren\u2019t??#LosAngeles \u2014 #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) September 22, 2019\n\nParts of Los Angeles are so dirty the team had to take extra precautions to stay safe during the cleanup to \"avoid being exposed to life-threatening diseases including typhus, typhoid fever and flesh-eating bacteria,\" The Daily Caller reports.\n\n\u201cL.A. is completely different than Baltimore,\u201d Presler said. \u201cHow crazy is it that it\u2019s 2019 \u2014 not the Stone Age \u2014 and here we are, having to worry about these kinds of diseases?\u201d He added that the CEO of a Christian homeless shelter in Los Angeles called Union Rescue Mission, Rev. Andy Bales, inspired him to take such protective measures after reading Bales\u2019s story about how he lost his leg to infection after stepping in human waste while helping homeless community members on Skid Row.
