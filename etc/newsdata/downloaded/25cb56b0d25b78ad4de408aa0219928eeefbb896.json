Literally nothing about the Jets looked good \u2014 quarterback Luke Falk threw zero TDs and one interception, the team was 0-12 on third-down conversions, and the defense\u2019s performance is obvious from the score.\n\nAfter the game, Le\u2019Veon Bell (18 carries, 35 yards, neither of those are misprints) took to Twitter to both talk tough and plead for some love:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nall you haters, enjoy it for now..just don\u2019t go casper when all this gets turned around..we embrace adversity, we embrace the hate, and everyone that wants to see my team fail, or me fail individually, I\u2019ll remember, we\u2019ll remember it ALL, & use it, & wear it as a badge of honor! \u2014 Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) September 22, 2019\n\n& all of the fans, we need you!

We\u2019ll give it our ALL and we\u2019ll be back after the bye..we love you all & we appreciate all your support, it\u2019s NEEDED.\u201d\n\nIt gets no easier for the Jets from here; their next four games are against the Eagles, the Cowboys, the Patriots (again), and the suddenly somewhat feisty Jaguars. The only realistic win in the near future doesn\u2019t show up until November when the Jets play Miami in Week 9.\n\nBut hey, at least the Jets won\u2019t lose next week, since they\u2019re on bye. Not even they could get an L while off ... right?\n\nLe'Veon Bell. (Getty)\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
