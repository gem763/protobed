Add Interest\n\nIn fact, according to a Justice Department official, the trip to Italy was organized with help from Trump himself, who introduced Barr to the Italian prime minister and other \u201cappropriate officials,\u201d as a Justice Department spokeswoman described them.\n\nAmong the others contacted by Trump on Barr\u2019s behalf was the prime minister of Australia, the Justice Department official told ABC News.\n\nWhat do Italy and Australia have to do with Russian interference in the 2016 election and members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign? A lot, actually.\n\nAt the heart of Barr's inquiry is whether the FBI or any other U.S. agency abused its authority in investigating and conducting surveillance of certain members of Trump's campaign.\n\nIn early 2016, Trump\u2019s campaign recruited a new adviser: businessman Carter Page, who -- by his own admission -- had been targeted by Russian spies for recruitment years earlier. After being announced as a member of Trump\u2019s campaign team, Page flew to Moscow to give the commencement address at a prominent graduate school that U.S. authorities have said has ties to Kremlin officials.\n\nThen, in late July 2016, the FBI received what FBI officials at the time described as a startling tip from the Australian government: The Russians had obtained \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton and were willing to help the Trump campaign defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe tip was passed through another Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos.\n\nCarlo Allegri/Reuters, FILE\n\nA few months earlier, looking to promote his work outside the campaign, Papadopoulos flew to Rome, Italy, where he was introduced by an unidentified individual to Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese-born professor with ties to Russia, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s final report.\n\n\u201cMifsud at first seemed uninterested in Papadopoulos when they met in Rome,\u201d Papadopoulos told Mueller\u2019s team, the report recounted. \u201cAfter Papadopoulos informed Mifsud about his role in the Trump Campaign, however, Mifsud appeared to take greater interest in Papadopoulos.\u201d\n\nThe two even met a week later in London, where Mifsud \u201ctold Papadopoulos that the Russian government had \u2018dirt\u2019 on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s report and court documents signed by Papadopoulos.\n\nWithin a week, Papadopoulos relayed that big claim to another one of his contacts in London: Australia\u2019s top diplomat, Alexander Downer. In fact, Papadopoulos even \u201csuggested\u201d to Downer \u201cthat the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to candidate Clinton,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\nThe Australian government then alerted the FBI. And, \u201cThe FBI opened its investigation of potential coordination between Russia and the Trump Campaign a few days later based on [that] information,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nIn particular, former FBI officials told lawmakers, the FBI wanted to identify who inside the Trump campaign could be in a position to work -- even unwittingly -- with Russian intelligence services.\n\nAs the FBI saw it, Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies, was a distinct possibility. And -- in addition to Mifsud\u2019s meeting with Papadopoulos in Rome -- a subsequent allegation against Page relayed to the FBI in Rome is likely part of why Barr is now so interested in Italy.\n\nEven before counterintelligence agents at FBI headquarters in Washington received Downer\u2019s tip alleging Russian efforts to help Trump\u2019s campaign, an FBI agent in Rome received a copy of the so-called \u201cdossier\u201d alleging an even deeper conspiracy between Russia and Trump\u2019s associates.\n\nThat document was compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, a previously-credible source of intelligence for the FBI who sent his salacious and unverified reports to an FBI agent in Rome he knew from such previous work.\n\nThe Rome-based agent then forwarded those reports to the FBI\u2019s New York field office in early July 2016, but the reports didn\u2019t make their way to the Washington-based FBI officials investigating Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election until mid-September, according to congressional testimony from several former FBI officials.\n\nAmong other allegations, the reports claimed Page had secretly met with senior Russian officials and that he was told the Kremlin might give the Trump campaign \u201ca dossier of \u2018kompromat\u2019\u201d about Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile Steele\u2019s reports didn\u2019t prompt the opening of the FBI\u2019s investigation, they did play a substantial part in the FBI later obtaining a federal judge\u2019s approval to eavesdrop on Page\u2019s communications.\n\nThat secret surveillance -- and whether it was appropriately \u201cpredicated\u201d -- is now a central part of Barr\u2019s review, the attorney general has said.\n\nMueller's investigation ultimately \"did not establish\" that Page or anyone else on Trump's team \"coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,\" Mueller's report said.\n\n\"I think spying did occur,\" Barr told lawmakers in April.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has conducted a similar review, and Horowitz\u2019s office recently completed a draft of its report on the matter, the inspector general recently told lawmakers.\n\nABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.", "description": "Why has Attorney General William Barr enlisted Italy and Australia in his review of the how the Russia probe began?", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/barr-gty-jt-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
