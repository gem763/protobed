Housing prices are going up, student debt is at an all-time high, and rent prices are making it more and more difficult to save for a down payment, particularly in areas with high-paying jobs (think: New York, Bay Area, Chicago).\n\nAll of these factors help explain why 45% of millennials interested in buying a home said that cost of living is holding them back from taking the plunge, according to a new survey of 2,582 U.S. adults from Bankrate. Compare that to the 38% of Gen X respondents or the 31% of baby boomers who said the same, and it paints a fuller picture about a young generation of hopeful homeowners, willing to move mountains \u2014 and perhaps even dip into their retirement accounts \u2014 to make it happen.\n\nThat\u2019s right, millennials are more likely to take money out of their retirement savings to fund their first home than Gen Xers or baby boomers. Some 13% of millennials said they used a portion of their retirement savings to help cover a down payment or closing costs while buying a home. Only 8% of Gen X and 7% of boomers did the same.\n\nDipping into your retirement savings is generally considered a personal finance no-no, since these funds grow in value over time and provide some cushion for later on, when medical bills inevitably ramp up. Many financial professionals would advise against messing with the money you set aside for your future self, and have you opt for something safer.\n\nBut the survey showed that millennials are firing harder on all cylinders to meet their down payment and closing costs. It\u2019s not just a matter of going straight to retirement savings; millennials are more resourceful (probably out of necessity) than older generations when it comes to utilizing different ways to come up with enough money for a down payment and closing costs:\n\nThe good news is that dipping into your retirement savings isn\u2019t necessarily a bad decision when you\u2019re buying a house. But it can be viewed only as a smart move if it\u2019s done responsibly, with the proper understanding of how your retirement savings works. Here are three major points to understand before deciding whether it\u2019s wise to dip into your retirement:", "description": "You're not supposed to touch retirement savings.", "authors": ["Prachi Bhardwaj"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wHTSK0do_x4k4L5HhQ_Jug--~B/aD00OTEyO3c9NzM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/66bcbf11b6d8a7e76460d0af8fc1324d", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
