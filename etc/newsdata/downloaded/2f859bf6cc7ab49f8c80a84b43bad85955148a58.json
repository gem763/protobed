We know that the last centimetres, the last millimetre are always the most difficult,\" he told the Belgian news broadcaster LN24.\n\nThe leaders will also contend at the summit with other challenges facing the EU, which has been torn in recent years by euroscepticism and economic disparities.\n\nThey will discuss the crisis in Syria touched off by Turkey's incursion against U.S.-allied Kurdish forces. The bloc this week agreed to limit arms exports to Turkey over its offensive, but stopped short of a bloc-wide embargo against a NATO ally.\n\n\"This is a deep, durable and multi-faceted crisis,\" said one senior EU diplomat, adding that EU member states were seriously concerned that the crisis would lead to Islamic State militants coming to Europe.\n\nTensions over EU enlargement\n\nDifferences over plans for the EU's first enlargement since 2013 will be exposed at the summit, with France insisting that Albania and North Macedonia are not ready for membership talks.\n\nParis says the EU's challenges \u2014 including Brexit, the emergence of China as a strategic rival and security threats posed by Russia \u2014 are already too extensive to admit two more states from a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\n\"It's a very difficult and political debate,\" said a second senior EU diplomat, describing it as an effort to find a balance between helping to stabilize the Balkans and putting the functioning of the bloc itself at risk.\n\nAnother key issue will be the EU's budget for 2021-2027, the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), and how to cover the shortfall when Britain leaves.\n\nMember states have yet to agree how much individual countries should contribute, a question made all the more difficult by proposals to end a system of rebates.\n\n\"It's not a discussion that will end in consensus, but the first time that they will enter into the numbers game,\" said a third senior EU diplomat. \"The positions are clear, but obviously there is division.\"\n\nThe summit will also be a chance to find common ground on climate targets ahead of a UN summit in Chile in December.\n\nThere is broad, though not unanimous, support for the EU to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, but there are differences among members over how much progress should be made by 2030.", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel said a deal on Britain's exit from the EU was still possible as EU leaders headed to Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit dominated by last-gasp negotiations.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323978.1571300463!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1181574401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
