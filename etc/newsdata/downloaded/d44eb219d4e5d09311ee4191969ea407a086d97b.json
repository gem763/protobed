Just hours later, he signed a one-year contract with the New England Patriots worth up to $15 million. The Pats then added a $20 million 2020 option \"to help for cap proration purposes this season,\" ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Monday.\n\nThe series of events leading up to Brown's departure were extensive:\n\nFollowing the Raiders' decision to cut ties with the four-time All-Pro, head coach Jon Gruden told reporters the organization \"exhausted everything\":\n\n\"We tried every way possible to make it work. And all I'm going to say is that it is disappointing. I'm really proud of our players, our coaches, our owner, our front office. We did everything we could to make this work. I'm sorry it didn't. I apologize, but I will tell you that I am very proud of what we did as an organization to try. And I wish Antonio nothing but the best. And I'm sorry we never got a chance to see him in the Silver and Black.\"\n\nHowever, to Rice's point, the Raiders could have tried giving Brown the literal moon and he still wouldn't have stayed. According to The Athletic's Jeff Howe, \"there are teams around the NFL that believe Brown wanted to be a Patriot all along, and Brown might have just been doing anything possible to propel himself out of Oakland.\"\n\nESPN's Schefter and Chris Mortensen added validity to that report with one of their own on Sunday NFL Countdown:\n\nAnd now\u2014after a trade from the Pittsburgh Steelers to Oakland that feels like a century ago\u2014Brown is eligible to make his Patriots debut in Week 2 at Miami.\n\nIf his long game was indeed to end up in New England, he succeeded\u2014so much so that Tom Brady told USA Today's Jarrett Bell his new receiver is welcome to move into his home.\n\nThe Patriots will hope to see the same kind of success on the field with Brown coming off an NFL-leading 15 receiving touchdowns as well as recording at least 1,000 receiving yards in each of the last six seasons.", "description": "At  Antonio Brown 's introductory press conference with the  Oakland Raiders  in March, the 31-year-old  told reporters  his goal was to catch  Jerry Rice  as the  NFL 's all-time leading receiver with his new team...", "authors": ["Megan Armstrong"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/827/300/hi-res-868d2e72f1f9fedcb94519f2ebb74c99_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
