It\u2019s time that the pack returns.\u2019\n\nGiving her back her Whisperer mask (which, for the uninitiated, is made of human skin and hair so they look like a Walker\u2026grim) it seems that the ruthless leader may have a new thorn in her side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The others have spoken of the life they saw,\u2019 Beta continues. \u2018She unsettles the pack.\u2019\n\nAlpha then assures: \u2018There is clarity amid the chaos. Do you doubt me?\u2019\n\n\u2018Never,\u2019 Beta shoots back.\n\nCan Gamma be the undoing of the Whisperers? (Picture: AMC)\n\nAmid their intense conversation, we see the initiation of a new member of the Whisperers \u2013 the introduction of Gamma (Thora Birch) to the team.\n\nShe was announced at San Diego Comic Con back in July, and described as a \u2018Whisperer sentry fiercly protective of Alpha\u2019.\n\nBut it appears that she could prove to be a chink in the armour of the unshakeable Alpha, whose previous scare tactics and demand for things her way resulted in 10 survivors dying with their heads beheaded and placed on pikes to send a message to the camp at Alexandria.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the new season, Samantha said: \u2018In Season 10, I\u2019m most excited for the fans to see Alpha\u2019s humanity, and understanding a little bit more about what are the Whisperers, why they behave the way they behave.\n\nMore: The Walking Dead The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus wants Dog's real name to honour late brother The Walking Dead drops first look trailer for new spin-off series and it's everything The Walking Dead confirms Lauren Cohan\u2019s Maggie will return for season 10\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve already seen this within the entire show, I think, but how the apocalypse affects some people one way and other people another way, and how primal instincts can take over individuals.\u2019\n\n\u2018Seeing more of that from a female perspective, as well, I think, is quite important,\u2019 she continued. \u2018With Alpha being this female villain, it\u2019s interesting to explore.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Walking Dead airs Sundays on AMC in the US and Mondays on Fox in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
