Myer suffered the effects of this change and has already worked to tackle the problem, reducing its physical presence, introducing new private labels and investing heavily in its online presence. These actions have helped the company post its first profit growth since 2010.\n\nBut the conventional department store model is still struggling to adapt to the demands of savvy consumers, who have turned to digital marketplaces.\n\nAccording to the April 2019 NAB online retail sales index, online department and variety stores were the fastest-growing category with 26.1 per cent growth since Amazon arrived in the Australian market last year, while the latest July report found Australians spent $29.33 billion online in the year to July, 11.5 per cent higher than the previous year.\n\nWhat is driving change?\n\nOnline marketplaces are providing an experience shoppers can\u2019t get in-store. From seamless offline to online shopping, personalisation and exclusive ranges, to convenient \"buy-now-pay-later\" options, express delivery and instant virtual assistance \u2013 shopping is easier, more intuitive and faster than ever.\n\nWith big shifts in industry operations, it\u2019s clear the department store model is under intense pressure in a changing retail economy \u2013 both digitally and physically \u2013 with 61 per cent of Australian consumers wanting personalised in-store experiences, which they aren\u2019t finding in department stores.\n\nConsumers want to shop in store, just differently.\n\nThe challenge for the department store is a structure that has pigeon-holed them into focusing on efficiency rather than experience. Prime real estate leases, breadth of variety and the need to remain competitive on price, place restrictive pressures on retailers to stave off further declines in sales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe desire to reduce operating costs to protect the bottom line prevents true innovation or deeper investment into experiences, which is what shoppers are calling for.\n\nThe likes of Woolworths, which are following in the steps of Amazon and setting up micro-fulfillment centres to drive express delivery, or Kmart, offering click and collect, have realised they can both enhance customer experience while making the bottom line work harder. And it\u2019s paying off \u2013 Woolworths last week posted a 56 per cent rise in annual profits to $2.7 billion for FY19.\n\nAustralian retail isn\u2019t in a recession, it\u2019s simply shifted elsewhere. We\u2019ve seen some of the highest levels of spending online than ever before. The retail landscape is evolving. Retailers must rise to cater to a consumer who now has unprecedented choice online, offline, locally and abroad.\n\nRob Hango-Zada is co-founder and joint-CEO of retail logistics platform Shippit.", "description": "Shippit co-chief executive says department stores still haven't learnt how to operate in an online world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8432%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_20%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dffc18e218fdfa6cdf9fd57d2effc78641f18f41", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
