It depicts a gruesome scene inside the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d in which Mr. Trump\u2019s head is superimposed on the body of a man who shoots, stabs and assaults parishioners whose faces have been replaced with logos of news organizations \u2014 including CNN, PBS and The Post \u2014 and those of his critics and political opponents \u2014 including former president Barack Obama, the late Sen. John McCain and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell. A figure representing the Black Lives Matter movement is shot in the head, and the video ends with a beaming Trump figure.\n\nA statement from American Priority , which hosted the event at the Trump National Doral, said the video was shown in a side room and not \u201capproved, seen, or sanctioned\u201d by organizers. It is more than a little troubling that they found \u201cshocking\u201d the reporting by the New York Times, which first disclosed the video\u2019s existence, as opposed to the video\u2019s vile contents. It is more than a little troubling that some of Mr. Trump\u2019s followers were comfortable with screening and watching it. And it is sad but unsurprising that Mr. Trump has issued no rebuke to his supporters and no forceful denunciation of the video itself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnsurprising, because Mr. Trump is no stranger to encouraging and celebrating violence. When a Mexican immigrant was beaten and urinated on in 2015 by men who invoked his name, Mr. Trump responded: \u201cI will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again.\u201d He bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose votes. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is\u201d was his riposte to the possibility of Supreme Court appointments by Hillary Clinton. He calls the media the \u201cenemy,\u201d so it is (again) unsurprising that those slaughtered in the video are journalists who have been publicly criticized by the president.\n\nWords that people use have consequences. It is unnerving to have a president who either doesn\u2019t know that or doesn\u2019t care.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The president offers no rebuke for a fake parody of him executing members of the media and political opponents.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hHeuSoIhUMuwXGoFYrnV_gSAN9I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B25MBSHMOYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
