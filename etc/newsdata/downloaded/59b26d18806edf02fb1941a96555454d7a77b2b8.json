(AP) - Louisville coach Chris Mack said he isn\u2019t buying the hype. He\u2019s making sure the No. 5 Cardinals don\u2019t, either.\n\nHe wants his players to know it is up to them to do something buzzworthy.\n\nIn many ways Louisville did that in Mack\u2019s first season, going from a scandal-marred program to NCAA Tournament participant. The Cardinals even upset Michigan State and North Carolina before limping down the stretch and getting bounced in the NCAA\u2019s first round.\n\nMack reminds players of the early tourney exit to help maintain perspective amid the preseason noise.\n\n\u201cI thought we exceeded a lot of expectations,\u201d he said during the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s preseason media day. \u201cIt also left a bitter taste in our mouths losing eight of the last 10, whatever it was.\n\n\u201cSo, despite all the fanfare, all the preseason prognosticators and covers of magazines and all that stuff, I try to tell our guys: Don\u2019t drink that poison. We haven\u2019t done anything yet, and we\u2019re the same team that felt as low as we did in the NCAA Tournament at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals (20-14, 10-8 ACC) plan to use the disappointing finish as motivation in building off what was supposed to be a transitional season.\n\nThey return six regulars, most notably top scorer and ACC preseason player of the year Jordan Nwora (17 points, 7.6 rebounds per game). He came back for a third season after participating in last summer\u2019s NBA draft combine along with fellow forward Steven Enoch.\n\nIf not for a knee injury that limited the 6-foot-7, 225-pound forward in combine drills and scrimmages, Nwora might have stayed in the draft pool. Instead, he\u2019s a key to Louisville\u2019s quest for a deep postseason run following a breakout year on both ends of the floor.\n\nMack\u2019s goal is making sure Nwora doesn\u2019t take on too much responsibility with capable teammates such as 6-11 Malik Williams, 6-10 Enoch and 6-5 Dwayne Sutton.\n\n\u201cWhat needs to be different is we are not solely reliant on him,\u201d the coach said of Nwora. \u201cNot that we were a year ago. But I think when you have the ability to take over a game like he does, sometimes you\u2019re overzealous, you\u2019re over-aggressive and he doesn\u2019t need to be.\u201d\n\nMack also recruited an impressive class including All-American forward Samuell Williamson and guard David Johnson, a Louisville native.\n\nOther things to watch in Louisville\u2019s season:\n\nUNDERMANNED\n\nThe Cardinals won\u2019t be at full strength until January as Johnson and Williams recover from offseason injuries. Williams underwent foot surgery in September and could return early next month. Johnson had July shoulder surgery that\u2019s expected to sideline him four to six months. Freshman forward Quinn Slazinski is recovering from appendicitis.\n\nPERRY\u2019S PERSISTENCE\n\nJunior guard Darius Perry acknowledges struggling to learn Mack\u2019s system before figuring it out late last season as a reserve. He improved during the offseason and could have more responsibility now that he has a better grasp.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what shots I was supposed to take or what he wanted me to actually do defensively sometimes,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThis year, I think I\u2019m almost 100% any time I\u2019m on the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFRESH\u201d FACE\n\nGuard Lamarr \u201cFresh\u201d Kimball was a three-time captain at St. Joseph\u2019s before arriving in Louisville as a graduate transfer. He averaged 11.4 points and 3.2 assists per game with the Hawks, including a career-best 15.6 points last season. The projected point guard follows Christen Cunningham, another grad transfer who was the Cardinals\u2019 floor general last year.\n\nFAMILIAR LOGOS\n\nThe \u201cDunking Cardinal\u201d logo featured during Louisville\u2019s old glory days is back as the center court logo at the team\u2019s KFC Yum! Center arena. The baseline design on Denny Crum Court also pays homage to the old scorer\u2019s table signage from Freedom Hall along with the fleur de lis pattern in the corners honoring the city flag.\n\nTHE SCHEDULE\n\nLouisville opens on Nov. 5 with an ACC matchup at Miami (Florida), its earliest opener in school history. Pittsburgh visits on Dec. 6 in another ACC game. The Cardinals\u2019 non-conference schedule includes Michigan, NCAA runner-up Texas Tech and their annual rivalry showdown at rival and No. 2 Kentucky on Dec. 28.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Louisville coach Chris Mack said he isn't buying the hype.
