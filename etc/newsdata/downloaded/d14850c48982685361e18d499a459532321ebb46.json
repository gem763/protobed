(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nFederal authorities are conducting a criminal investigation of the former compliance officer at a McKesson Corp. warehouse in southern central Ohio, alleging he conspired to illegally distribute powerful narcotics over eight years, according to court records.\n\nWith no announcement, David B. Gustin was indicted in March by a grand jury in eastern Kentucky on one count of conspiracy, a charge that carries a penalty of as much as 20 years in prison, records show.\n\nThe court records reveal the charges against Gustin stem from his responsibility to detect whether 13,000 pharmacy customers in 15 states were allowing drugs distributed by McKesson to be diverted to the black market. Two other people have been told they are possible targets of the probe, and subpoenas for information have been issued to McKesson, the largest drug distributor in the United States, documents show.\n\n\u201cThe basis of the charge is Mr. Gustin\u2019s alleged conduct as a director of regulatory affairs,\u201d Gustin\u2019s attorney, Brian Butler, wrote in a motion he filed. \u201cThe United States\u2019 theory seems to be that Mr. Gustin was so woefully negligent in overseeing his compliance responsibilities that his conduct was criminal.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the government said in a motion that Gustin \u201cknows the charge pertains to the distribution of controlled substances, including oxycodone, hydrocodone and alprazolam\u201d from May 2, 2008 to April 15, 2016.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, Gustin worked for McKesson Pharmaceutical, a drug distributor selling controlled substances throughout the country,\u201d the motion said.\n\nIn a May filing, prosecutors described the grand jury investigation as \u201congoing.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office for Eastern Kentucky \u2014 which alleges that illegal conduct occurred in the state\u2019s Clay County and elsewhere \u2014 is overseeing the investigation. Officials there declined to discuss the case. The Justice Department referred questions to that office. The Drug Enforcement Administration, McKesson and Butler refused or did not respond to requests for information.\n\nIn a statement, McKesson spokeswoman Kristin Chasen referred a reporter to federal authorities. She said \u201cthe one-paragraph indictment of Mr. Gustin, who is a former employee, contains no specific allegations, and McKesson is not named. . . . We have been responsive to the government\u2019s inquiries.\u201d She also acknowledged that McKesson has received subpoenas about Gustin\u2019s tenure at the company.\n\nMore than 21 million doses of oxycodone and hydrocodone were distributed in Clay County between 2006 and 2012, according to a government database. With a population of about 20,000 people, that works out to 133 pills for every person each year.\n\nMcKesson delivered 1.88 million doses of narcotics in the county over that seven-year period, making it the fourth-largest distributor of pain pills during that time. Community Drug of Manchester received 5.7 million pills, by far the most of any drugstore. Manchester has a population of 1,331. A telephone call to the drugstore came back as a nonworking number. In 2013, the owner of the pharmacy and his wife pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to illegally distribute oxycodone and were sent to prison.\n\nThe Washington Post gained access to the DEA\u2019s Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System under a court order. The Post and HD Media, which publishes the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia, waged a year-long legal battle for access to the database, which the government and the drug industry had sought to keep secret.\n\nSince 2006, the DEA has been enforcing laws against diversion of legal painkillers by bringing administrative and civil cases against drug wholesalers such as McKesson, often in the face of stiff opposition from them. The federal Controlled Substances Act and regulations make these distributors responsible for identifying, halting and reporting suspicious orders of opioid painkillers from dispensers such as pharmacies, hospitals, pain clinics and others.\n\nBut in recent months, two U.S. attorneys have stepped up that effort by filing criminal charges against two medium-sized drug distributors \u2014 Ohio-based Miami-Luken and Rochester Drug Cooperative of New York \u2014 and four of their former executives.\n\nPursuing criminal charges against a former manager for McKesson \u2014 the seventh-largest public company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine \u2014 could mark a significant escalation of that effort.\n\nMiami-Luken is out of business and The Washington Post could not reach the executives or identify their attorneys when they were indicted in July. Rochester Drug Cooperative and one executive did not dispute the charges. The lawyer for another said his client was being framed and vowed to fight the charges.\n\nIn 2017, The Washington Post and \u201c60 Minutes\u201d revealed that the DEA and federal prosecutors conducted a two-year nationwide investigation of McKesson drug distribution warehouses. They determined by 2014 that the company failed to report suspicious orders of millions of painkillers sent from 11 warehouses, from Sacramento to Lakeland, Fla.\n\nDEA investigators said they were convinced they had enough evidence to bring the first-ever criminal charges against McKesson and to seek a $1 billion fine. But attorneys at the DEA and Justice Department did not agree and struck a deal with the company in 2017 that required it to pay a $150 million fine and temporarily halt shipments of controlled substances from four warehouses, including the one where Gustin worked in Washington Court House, Ohio, in the south-central part of the state.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2017 settlement, shipments of controlled substances are currently suspended at that warehouse. Though the two sides settled out of court, the agreement does not prevent authorities from bringing criminal charges.\n\nOther than the one-paragraph indictment of Gustin himself, the court record in his case largely consists of legal sparring between U.S. Attorney Robert M. Duncan Jr.\u2019s office and Butler over Gustin\u2019s demand for a \u201cbill of particulars\u201d that would provide more details of the case against him.\n\nThe documents also show that Gustin and McKesson have an agreement to work together on the legal case and that nearly 190,000 pages of documents have been turned over to him. But the government wants to limit how much of that material \u2014 including grand jury information \u2014 Gustin can share with his former employer. Prosecutors suggest that McKesson\u2019s \u201cinterests could conflict with those of Gustin and could potentially jeopardize the ongoing grand jury investigation.\u201d\n\nGustin has asked to know who his alleged co-conspirators are, and which pharmacies participated in the alleged conspiracy.\n\nIn an April filing, Butler said the case \u201cappears to raise novel questions of fact and law\u201d because they focus on the way Gustin performed his duties for McKesson. He also said there may be \u201cstatute of limitations issues\u201d with an indictment that came nearly five years after Guston left McKesson.\n\nHe suggested the case \u201cmay be the first time a mid-level compliance manager has been prosecuted for allegedly failing to properly do his compliance job.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nNationwide probe of McKesson ends with a whimper investigators say\n\nProsecutors bring rare criminal charges against opioid distributor, former execs\n\nHow drugs intended for pain patients ended up in the wrong hands", "description": "Subpoenas have been issued to the giant drug distributor, one person has been indicted and two others told they are possible targets.", "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health", "Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "Scott Higham", "Investigative Reporter", "September At Pm", "Lenny Bernstein Covers Health", "Medicine.
