Ultimately, the utility plans to halt power to around 800,000 customers spread across high-risk regions in tens of counties throughout the state.\n\nSpurred by forecasts of high winds and hot weather, the preemptive measure aims to decrease the risk of wildfires caused by damage to PG&E\u2019s aging infrastructure. The shutoff is expected to continue through midday Thursday, or until conditions sufficiently improve.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our most important responsibility, which is why PG&E has decided to turn power off to customers during this widespread, severe wind event,\u201d Michael Lewis, PG&E\u2019s senior vice president of Electric Operations told the Los Angeles Times . \u201cWe understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public\u2019s patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce the risk of wildfire.\u201d\n\nA second phase of the planned shutoff will impact over 234,000 from multiple counties\u2014including Alameda and Santa Clara, which are home to Oakland and San Jose, respectively\u2014and is expected to begin at 12 p.m. PDT. The utility says a third phase impacting approximately 42,000 customers throughout yet-to-be determined counties is currently being considered. Today\u2019s planned shutoff is the second this month. Last weekend, several counties in Northern California were affected by an hours-long shutoff.\n\nNortherly winds have increased considerably across the northern #SacramentoValley since 3 AM. Many locations are now reporting gusts (red) of 25 to 35 mph. #CAwx #rddwx pic.twitter.com/yiBSBqoc74 \u2014 NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) October 9, 2019\n\nHot, dry, and windy weather conditions pose a significant fire danger. Several parts of California are under a red flag warning, and gusts are expected to reach up to 70 mph at higher elevations. \u201cTonight is when we expect the winds to reach their peak intensity, from about mid-evening all the way through about mid-morning Thursday,\u201d weather service meteorologist Duane Dykema told the Mercury News .\n\nSouthern California Edison, the utility responsible for providing power to Southern California\u2019s residents, indicated it may also cut power to residents this week due to strong Santa Ana winds. Approximately 173,942 customers throughout high-risk regions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties, among others, would be affected.\n\nCal OES, the state\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, has designated several locations in impacted areas at which residents can charge phones, use restrooms, and access bottled water.\n\nBeginning Wed. (10/9) at 8 a.m., Community Resource Centers will be open in various locations for those impacted by #PSPS. Restrooms, bottled water and electronic-device charging will be available, among other resources. Daylight hours only.

Then, in February, the utility announced its infrastructure likely caused the 2018 Camp Fire, which devastated the town of Paradise and killed 86 people.\n\nThe number of planned power shutoffs are expected to increase in the coming years as utilities struggle to update their infrastructure in the face of increasingly hot, dry, and windy weather conditions spurred by climate change.\n\nAs many Californians wait for the power to come back on, they\u2019re undoubtedly left wondering: \u201cIs this the new normal?\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "High winds and hot weather brought on the preemptive measure.", "authors": ["Jennifer Leman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bmGK18bh7t8VjrSI5lmDTg--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/8fb663d5c8aac5428e8224fd92764ea4", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
