Ms. Carr, who assumed the role early last year, joined the company in 2010 as chief accounting officer and controller. She is expected to leave the company next month, Comerica said.\n\nThe departure wasn\u2019t linked to \u201cany issue, concern or disagreement\u201d with accounting, financial reporting or internal controls, Comerica said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cMuneera has made many valuable contributions to Comerica, both as chief financial officer and while she served as chief accounting officer,\u201d Chief Executive Curtis C. Farmer said in a statement.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAn abrupt change in the CFO post could weigh on share prices in the near term, analysts for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said in a research note Friday. Comerica\u2019s shares rose 1.3% to $65.60 Friday.\n\nMr. Herzog joined Comerica in 1984. He was named treasurer in 2011, steering the lender\u2019s liquidity and interest rate risks. Comerica said it has launched a search for a permanent CFO.\n\nThe company\u2019s next finance chief will have to navigate a lower interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point in July. President Trump has pressured for further cuts in hopes of inoculating the economy from a downturn. Economists expect another quarter-point retreat following meetings next week of Federal Reserve officials.\n\nComerica is among the lenders most sensitive to lower interest rates because of its heavy concentration of commercial and industrial loans, which produce less income for the lender when interest rates are cut. Commercial loans made up 64% of Comerica\u2019s total loans as of June 30, according to regulatory filings.\n\nComerica, with main operations in Michigan, California and Texas, in August estimated that a quarter-point rate cut by the Fed would lower its annual net interest income by $60 million to $90 million.\n\n\u201cOur asset sensitivity enhanced our performance as rates increased,\u201d Wendy Bridges, a Comerica spokesperson, said in an interview. \u201cIn addition, over the past few years we have significantly improved our efficiency, actively managed our capital levels and maintained our underwriting discipline. These actions have produced strong results and better positioned us to weather a lower rate environment.\u201d\n\nIn the quarter ended June 30, Comerica\u2019s net interest income rose 2.2% to $603 million compared with the same period a year earlier. Net income, however, slipped 8.3% to $297 million. Comerica posted earnings per share of $1.94 during the quarter, below the expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet who forecast $2 a share.\n\n\u2014Aaron Back contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at Ezequiel.Minaya@wsj.com and Chris Wack at chris.wack@wsj.com", "description": "Comerica disclosed that its finance chief is leaving and treasurer James Herzog has been named interim CFO, a move that comes as the regional lender braces for lower interest rates that could cut into its bottom line.", "authors": ["Ezequiel Minaya", "Chris Wack", "Ezequiel.Minaya Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107136/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
