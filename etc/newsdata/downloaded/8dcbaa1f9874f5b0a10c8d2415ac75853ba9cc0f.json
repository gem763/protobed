Stand with Hong Kong\u201d \u2014 with statements that American politicians said were kowtowing to China.\n\nBut, under mounting pressure in the United States, Silver on Tuesday made a strong defence of Morey\u2019s right to free speech and American values that provoked outrage in China\u2019s state-controlled media.\n\n\u201cThe long-held values of the NBA are to support freedom of expression, and certainly freedom of expression by members of the NBA community,\u201d Silver said on a visit to Japan.\n\nOutside the arena, a number of fans handed out small Chinese flags to those arriving. \u201cWe think it is necessary to express our love for our country,\u201d said one man, who gave only his surname, Xiong.\n\nXiong said he was passing the flags out as a \u201cbasketball fan\u201d and hoped to distribute 10,000.\n\nDespite the Chinese anger, so far there has been no broad anti-NBA protest campaign on China\u2019s government-controlled internet, nor any suggestion that the popular broadcasts in China of the NBA\u2019s upcoming regular season are in jeopardy.\n\nChina sports industry insiders told AFP that, if the situation does not further deteriorate, the NBA was expected to weather the crisis \u2014 though likely with some financial losses \u2014 thanks to its popularity in China, where it is arguably the single most popular sports league.\n\nHong Kong has endured nearly four months of protests ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to be tried in China\u2019s opaque courts.\n\nThey snowballed into a movement calling for more democratic freedoms, the biggest challenge to China\u2019s rule of Hong Kong since its handover from Britain in 1997.\n\nChina reacts fiercely to any questioning of its sovereignty over semi-autonomous Hong Kong, and state media has repeatedly warned foreign firms that voicing support for protesters could cost them access to China\u2019s market of 1.4 billion people.\n\nApple on Thursday removed an app criticised by China for allowing protestors in Hong Kong to track police.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 The NBA\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets faced off Thursday before adoring Chinese fans in an exhibition game", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/c1acfa_heavy-police-presence-nba-game-in-shanghai-got-way-smoothly-china-fans-cheer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
