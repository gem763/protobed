We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe will be looking at the 14-game main slate starting at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nDallas Keuchel - Atlanta (vs. Philadelphia)\n\nThere are numerous cash game pitchers within this expanded 14-game slate, but Keuchel gets my vote with one of the best salary, floor, and ceiling combinations. His opponent, Philadelphia, ranks 19th in wRC+ (92) this season. Keuchel has found his groove lately with six straight quality starts, including a strong showing against the Phillies (6 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 8 K, W) last Wednesday. A repeat performance isn\u2019t out of the question.\n\nAlso Consider: Justin Verlander, Sonny Gray, Adam Plutko\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMitch Garver - Minnesota (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nYou read that correctly, as I\u2019m seriously considering a catcher on sites where the backstop is merged with first basemen: that\u2019s how good of a play Mitch Garver represents tonight. The Minnesota catcher is in the midst of an outstanding breakout season with a .279 average and 30 homers. Garver has been an absolute revelation against left-handed pitching, holding a 199 wRC+ and .417 ISO split in that regard. In other words, he carries outstanding upside against White Sox LHP Ross Detwiler\u2019s .421 wOBA split to right-handed bats.\n\nAlso Consider: Freddie Freeman, Jose Abreu\n\nStory continues\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nRobinson Cano - NY Mets (at Colorado)\n\nThe Mets represent the highest run-scoring projection of the night while taking their hacks in the hitting utopia of Coors Field. Colorado RHP Tim Melville has allowed 17 hits and 12 earned runs across 10.2 innings over his last three appearances, and I\u2019m expecting that generosity to continue. Needless to say, Cano represents a strong lift within a promising Mets\u2019 stack.\n\nAlso Consider: Ozzie Albies, Jurickson Profar\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. - Toronto (at Baltimore)\n\nGuerrero holds a non-imposing salary with some exciting upside in his back pocket. That could be on full display against a horrible Baltimore pitching staff led by RHP Dylan Bundy\u2019s .344 wOBA split to right-handed bats. Third base is extremely competitive tonight, but Vlad represents one of the better \u201cper dollar\u201d options on the board.\n\nAlso consider: Yoan Moncada, Miguel Sano\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nTim Anderson - Chicago White Sox (at Minnesota)\n\nMinnesota LHP Martin Perez looked great through the first two months of the season, but it has been a rollercoaster ride ever since. The Twins\u2019 southpaw owns a vulnerable .367 wOBA split to right-handed bats over the past two years, and the White Sox have several quality hitters to take advantage. That includes the impressive contact, power, and speed combination of Anderson, who is destined to make some fantasy noise in this draw.\n\nAlso Consider: Jonathan Villar, Xander Bogaerts\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nJeff McNeil - NY Mets (at Colorado)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Mets represent the highest run-scoring projection of the night. I\u2019ll definitely assemble NYM stacks against Colorado RHP Melville, especially in cash games. McNeil is one of my favorite hitters within that, fresh off a 2-5, HR, 2 RBI showing at Coors Field yesterday. McNeil, Cano, Michael Conforto, and Pete Alonso are the leading candidates within this well-aligned offense.\n\nNelson Cruz - Minnesota (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nI\u2019m all about stacking Mets and Twins while sprinkling in the other featured players to make a lineup work. Cruz and Garver represent my favorite lifts from Minnesota, as both demolish left-handed pitching. The 38-year-old designated hitter doesn\u2019t seem phased by a wrist injury, clobbering massive homers with remarkable exit velocity over the past week. There should be more where that came from against White Sox LHP Detwiler\u2019s vulnerabilities to right-handed bats.\n\nAlso consider: Michael Conforto, J.D. Martinez, Brandon Nimmo, J.D.
