I couldn\u2019t see the relevance of what we were being taught\n\nWith no adult figure to provide encouragement, Katlego found it hard to see the point of school.\n\n\n\n\u201cI needed to make money and no one was helping me. I couldn\u2019t see the relevance of what we were being taught. I was in class hungry, worried about things at home and totally overwhelmed \u2013 I wasn\u2019t receptive to learning.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t mention his problems to his teachers, he saw it as his personal plight.\n\nThe final straw was walking home one day to see their meagre household contents on the pavement.\n\nHis granny had been evicted and they were homeless.\n\nThe hardship battered Katlego\u2019s self-image. He knew he had less than many others and became hardened and alienated from his classmates.\n\nThen came the pain of failing Grade 10, drawing criticism about his underperformance from people unaware of his background problems.\n\nHe dropped out of school and anticipated a future as an aimless thug.\n\nYet the Katlego I reconnected with recently has become a powerful young leader and an active contributor to society.\n\nI\u2019m struck by his intelligence and thoughtfulness, his confidence and humility.\n\nMost of all I\u2019m struck by his deep service ethic and sense of purpose shown through his contribution to society in the past few years.\n\nKatlego, very reluctantly, had been encouraged to return to school by an adult.\n\nHis return coincided with his school choosing to work with Columba Leadership, an organisation that helps principals, teachers and pupils untap their leadership potential.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe vice-principal invited me to participate in the leadership programme, which required me to write about the change I wished to see in my life, my school and my community.\u201d\n\nI was helped to realise that I had value, that I could contribute and that I had a purpose in life\n\nKatlego was selected and joined the week-long residential academy that kicks off a three-year programme.\n\n\u201cFrom the first day things shifted. Suddenly, I was engaged in activities that had meaning. I was in a safe space where we could all share what was going on in our lives.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was helped to realise that I had value, that I could contribute and that I had a purpose in life.\u201d\n\nHe and 11 of his peers returned to school as young leaders and began actively resolving problems at the school using their own ingenuity.\n\nThey cleaned the toilets. They planted a vegetable garden to contribute to the school feeding scheme.\n\nThey put on a musical show that raised more than R30 000 and they ran academic study sessions twice a week.\n\nThey visited people in old-age homes to keep them company and visited other schools and children\u2019s homes to help them develop their own self-worth and not be defeated by their circumstances.\n\nBy now Katlego actively wanted to be at school to bring about changes and recreate himself in a different light.\n\nHis focus shifted to where he was going, not where he had been. He grew receptive to learning and his marks improved.\n\nThe story of Katlego\u2019s turnaround is not unique. About 90% of pupils who take part in Columba Leadership\u2019s programme complete their schooling \u2013 far above the 40% national average.\n\nThe organisation has worked with 200 schools across South Africa so far, helping thousands of youngsters to redirect their own future by gaining self-esteem and skills in critical thinking, collaboration, communication, resilience and an ethos of ethical leadership.\n\nThey become role models who contribute to improving discipline and creating a more conducive environment for learning.\n\nRead: Grade 9 proposal isn\u2019t a school-leaving certificate, department says\n\nAlthough we cannot afford to touch every school yet, our practical experience can be repeated by educators who realise that youngsters have the inner resources to rise above their circumstances and make changes if they are given the opportunity and responsibility.\n\nSchools need to nurture their pupils and help them unleash their potential, otherwise the dropout rate will continue to climb.\n\nTracy Hacklandis the CEO of Columba Leadership, where Katlego now works.
