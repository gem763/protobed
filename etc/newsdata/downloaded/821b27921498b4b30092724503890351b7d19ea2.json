But, as you know, there is no such thing as a free flight. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) rescue effort, Operation Matterhorn, will cost \u00a3100m. The airlift is open to anyone with a booking on the defunct travel firm\u2019s airline between 23 September and 6 October. Around \u00a360m will come out of the fund for travellers with Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol) protection. And the taxpayer foots the bill for everyone else.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe collapse of the world\u2019s mightiest travel brand has been wretched for many. Thousands of excellent Thomas Cook staff are seeking new jobs. All 800,000 Atol-protected holidaymakers whose future holiday disappeared along with the company are still waiting simply to begin the process of claiming their money back \u2013 which, they are warned, may not arrive until December.\n\nYet long before Christmas, some Thomas Cook customers will profit from the collapse of the company. They will take advantage of a loophole in the taxpayer-funded airlift: even though they got a free flight home, they are legally entitled to claim back the cost of their original Thomas Cook flight from their card company.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

(It wasn\u2019t free for me; with no commercial fare available, I paid \u00a3200 to the Abta LifeLine fund, which is helping Thomas Cook employees who are in financial difficulties.)\n\nQuite rightly, everyone who had booked a proper package holiday with Atol protection was looked after, with special free tea and coffee on offer. But passengers who had chosen to travel unprotected got exactly the same treatment, and stand to get a modest financial windfall as well.\n\nThe government has created this plainly absurd state of affairs. Politicians don\u2019t want wall-to-wall news reports about British holidaymakers abandoned in Alicante or stranded in Skiathos during the party conference season (which coincides with the financially brutal end of September/start of October, when travel firms are most prone to go pop).\n\nYet the message that travellers pick up is: no need to take responsibility, the taxpayer will rescue you. This sense of entitlement does no one any favours \u2013 especially the staff and passengers of travel firms who diligently use the Atol scheme.\n\nNext time a big holiday company fails, travellers with Atol cover must be prioritised, and chancers left to their own online devices. No one wants to see travellers in distress. But as the volcanic ash grounding of all northern European flights in 2010 proved there is always another way home. It might be slow and expensive, but that is the price of taking a risk with travel protection.", "description": "Surely this is the best-ever \u201cfree flights\u201d offer? \u201cAll Thomas Cook customers, wherever they are around the world, will be brought back to the UK on special free flights or booked onto another scheduled airline at no extra cost,\u201d says the Department for Transport (DfT).", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/16/crewcall.jpg"}
