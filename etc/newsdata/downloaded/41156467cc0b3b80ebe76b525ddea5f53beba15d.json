AirAsia\n\nMalaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) must urgently fix the \u201cworsening\u201d congestion in Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (klia2) before an expected 30 million tourists arrive in Malaysia during next year\u2019s Visit Malaysia campaign, low cost carrier AirAsia has said.\n\nRiad Asmat, chief executive officer of AirAsia Malaysia, said in a statement on Thursday (Oct 17) that long queues for foreigners are now a daily occurrence. According to the CEO, the congestion is now severe enough for \u201ccountless guests\u201d to miss connecting flights and appointments.\n\n\u201cThe airport is the first encounter visitors have with Malaysia, and it is shameful that their first experience of our country is one that showcases inefficiency and poor customer service, particularly with Visit Malaysia 2020 (VM2020) just around the corner,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: A reluctant AirAsia says it will collect full airport tax from Aug 9 \u2018under strong protest\u2019\n\nAccording to AirAsia, some guests have to queue for over an hour during peak periods such as between 3am to 7am, 2pm to 7pm and 9pm to 12am.\n\n\u201cThe problem is caused by the poor design and flawed configuration of klia2,\u201d said Benyamin Ismail, chief executive officer of AirAsia X, the carrier\u2019s long-haul arm.\n\nBenyamin said that MAHB had previously assured that adjustments would be made to extend immigration clearance into areas presently occupied by duty-free outlets.\n\nRead also: Tony Fernandes says AirAsia will no longer collect KLIA2 fees, and wants compensation for \u2018holes\u2019 on runways\n\n\u201cHowever, up to now we have not seen anything done to address the problem and congestion has worsened daily, with some passengers having to endure long queues that stretch all the way back to disembarkation gates,\u201d he added.\n\nAirAsia\u2019s statement added that even though the Immigration Department keeps all counters open during peak periods, there was nothing much more the authority could do to alleviate the congestion.\n\nMAHB is responsible for the floor space and configuration at klia2, including the ability to add more counters and extend queuing areas, the carrier said.\n\nRead also: Malaysia Airports demanded AirAsia take down \u2018false\u2019 articles about MAHB from their website \u2013 and of course, they said no\n\nBoth AirAsia executives urged the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom) to step in to ensure that the matter is quickly resolved.\n\nThis is not the first time AirAsia has spoken out against MAHB.\n\nBoth companies have been involved in a series of lawsuits over various issues relating to the management of airports, particularly klia2.\n\nMost recently, the airline group filed a suit against MAHB for nearly RM480 million due to \u201closs and damage\u201d caused by what it said was MAHB\u2019s negligence, New Straits Times reported.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Long queues that span over an hour are now a daily occurrence, AirAsia said..
