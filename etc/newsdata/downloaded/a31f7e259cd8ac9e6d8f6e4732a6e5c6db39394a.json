(Photo: The CW)\n\nThe Flash has returned for its sixth season. It was, in many ways, a season premiere of The Flash (it\u2019s almost like the show\u2019s done six of those!): a new villain to face, some time travel bullshit, some crossover teasing, Iris is doing a journalism again, Barry\u2019s moody about something. You know the drill. It was good, but made even better by something the show has been dying to do for years.\n\nThe villain of the week for \u201cInto the Void\u201d was Chester P. Runk \u2014 a name familiar to Flash comics fans. In the comics, Chester was an overweight nerd who, after testing an experimental matter transmitting machine he created, was transformed into a human black hole. In order to stop himself from being sucked into the bizarre reality his body was suddenly connected to, Chester gorged himself on anything he could get his hands on until he was 47 times his original size. Geddit! Fat jokes! Ah, comics.\n\nAnyhoo, Chester \u2014 going by \u201cChunk\u201d because, once again, fat jokes! \u2014 had a brief life of crime in the comics, using his black hole power to imprison people who slighted him in his life, until he eventually became an infrequent ally of Wally West\u2019s version of the Flash, reforming himself into a wealthy businessman who used his black hole powers to conveniently disappear unwanted objects.\n\nThe \u201cInto the Void\" version of Chester has thankfully ditched the body-shaming but kept the powerset with a few tweaks. As black holes suddenly started randomly appearing around Central City \u2014 which, to be fair, is basically a regular occurrence in Central City at this point \u2014 Team Flash\u2019s investigation leads them to a catatonic Chester. Like his comics counterpart, an accident with a science experiment gone wrong gave Chester the seemingly uncontrollable ability to open black holes around himself, but unlike the comics, the accident rendered him comatose instead of, well, forced to eat himself into a caricature.\n\nIris and Barry start their investigation into the black holes the same way they start every investigation they do: gawping at a computer screen in STAR Labs. (Photo: The CW)\n\nWhile Barry and the STAR Labs crew immediately set about finding a way to close the portals via violent detonation, Iris\u2019 own sleuthing leads to them uncovering that part of Chester\u2019s consciousness is trapped inside the black holes he\u2019s creating, giving him some latent ability to manipulate them even from his catatonic state \u2014 using a grenade Cisco developed to blow the holes up would kill Chester. Unwilling to let an innocent person die in the wake of so recently losing Nora, Barry eventually figures out an audacious plan to use Nora\u2019s own anti-Cicada gauntlet to recover the separated parts of Chester\u2019s brainwaves from inside the black holes... which also have now merged into a singular, giant hole above the city.\n\nLook, this show\u2019s never been big on science that can\u2019t be explained by either \u201ccomic books\u201d or \u201cspeedforce bullshit.\u201d Anyway, Barry revs up to go into action and leap into the black hole. And, via Cisco, The Flash finally, finally does something that is incredibly goofy, completely rad, and something it has simply been yearning to do since it first began: Cisco taps a key on STAR Labs\u2019 sound system.\n\nAnd Queen\u2019s Flash Gordon theme starts playing.\n\nIt\u2019s so dumb. It\u2019s so good. It is, as Cisco argues, the perfect moment to deploy the 1980 classic. You don\u2019t care that the black hole CG comes with all the questionable success CW-budget computer effects usually bring. You don\u2019t care that this has been, otherwise, a pretty humdrum episode of The Flash, and weirdly low key for a season premiere. This is what this show has always been, and hopefully always will be, about: embracing the sheer, kinetic, camp audacity of superhero comics and just having an absolute whale of a time while doing so.\n\nOf course after the day\u2019s saved and Queen stops playing, we have the now seemingly mandatory sequence on the DC/CW shows these days of the Monitor showing up to portend some dire news. In this case, Barry\u2019s disappearance/death is happening sooner than planned, and a Crisis\u2014the Crisis \u2014 is coming on December 10, 2019. Nice of the universe to schedule itself around the CW like that, isn\u2019t it?\n\nEditor's note: It's not clear when Crisis On Infinite Earths will screen in Australia at this stage but it's due to show on Foxtel.\n\nBut Crisis on Infinite Crossovers aside, hell, the rest of \u201cInto the Void\u201d aside, at least we got this one gloriously silly moment before everything really starts hitting the speedforce fan for Barry and his friends. He\u2019s for every one of us, indeed.\n\nYou can watch Seasons One to Four on Stan while the Season 6 premiere, \"In The Void\", is available on Foxtel.", "description": "The Flash has returned for its sixth season.
