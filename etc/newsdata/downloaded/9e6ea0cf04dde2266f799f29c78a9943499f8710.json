The family of Pham Thi Tra My, 26, who sent her mother a series of messages from inside the container, said that she was one of those.\n\nDetective Chief Superintendent Stuart Hooper, who is leading the investigation, said: \u201cFinding and speaking to the Hughes brothers is crucial to our investigation.\n\n\u201cAt this time we believe they are in Northern Ireland but they also have links to the Irish Republic\u2026\n\n\"This is a case where 39 men and women have tragically died and support from the community is going to be vital to help bring those responsible to justice.\u201d\n\nMo Robinson was driving the cab which collected the container in which 39 people were found dead More\n\nThe refrigerated container in which the bodies were found belonged to Global Truck Rentals, which has its headquarters in Dublin, and was leased to Ronan on October 15.\n\nThe address given on the lease document for the rental is said to match that of haulier C Hughes Transport in Leitrim, County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe transport company was dissolved in 2017 but a C Hughes Logistics lists its business address as a post box along a farm track in Armagh, just over the border in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhen the Daily Telegraph visited a number of addresses linked to the brothers last week they were aggressively told to leave.\n\nAt the Leitrim address a black van with tinted windows roared out of the driveway and appeared to tail the reporters until they left the county.\n\nThe bodies were discovered in the refrigerated container in the early hours of October 23 Credit: REX More\n\nRonan also owns a blue Scania cab which was seized at Dover port over the weekend in connection with the investigation.\n\nThe cab was registered in Bulgaria and had Bulgarian plates, like the one used to collect the container full of bodies from Purfleet in Essex last week.", "description": "Two Irish brothers are being hunted by police investigating the deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex.", "authors": ["Hayley Dixon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iOp74B4W_ozlpnpEPn7hAQ--~B/aD0zOTc7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/76b860e29e6dccd55a2e5d7d0baece24", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
