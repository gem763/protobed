She also provided welcome character analysis that bled into cheeky social commentary. \u201cFleabag came from a very personal place for me. It began as a way to get Andrew Scott to dress up as a priest and tell me that he loved me,\u201d she joked, then turned her attention to the larger phenomenon that Scott\u2019s character had inspired. \u201cI call the character \u2018Priest\u2019 in the script, but everyone started calling him \u2018Hot Priest.\u2019 Obviously Andrew is hot, but this \u2018Priest\u2019 character caused such a horn-storm. Andrew and I were trying to figure out what it was about him that was driving women so mental. And we boiled it down and realized, it was because he was doing this one thing: listening. Really, really listening. Try it, guys.\u201d Returning to her point about Fleabag\u2019s lasciviousness, Waller-Bridge encouraged the audience not to neglect their genitals: \u201cBack in the day, horny women were to be feared, and now they\u2019re given Emmys.\u201d\n\nFleabag was originally written as a one-woman show, so it\u2019s not surprising that Waller-Bridge would deliver a satisfying monologue. But she also enlivened several sketches, deploying both highbrow and lowbrow humor. In the best skit of the evening, she played a wife corresponding with her pilot husband (Mikey Day), off fighting in World War II. Day\u2019s character wrote a lengthy, descriptive, affection-filled note to his wife, but when the camera cut back to Waller-Bridge, she was stoic and curt: \u201cDear William, thank you. Love, Lydia.\u201d\n\nThe sketch escalated predictably at first, with William growing frustrated that his wife didn\u2019t seem invested in his well-being, emotionally or otherwise. But soon, Lydia revealed that she\u2019s embroiled in a social circle that includes none other than Adolf Hitler. Waller-Bridge effortlessly shepherded her character from marital listlessness to reprehensible excitement. The bit was fertile ground for the actor, whose sociopolitical savvy and deft emotional projections came together neatly. With its slow turn toward inanity, the sketch also satirized the romantic tolls of war and the ease with which dissatisfied citizens can be ensorcelled by demagogues.\n\nThe most absurd sketch of the evening, meanwhile, saw Waller-Bridge playing a contestant on the frothy British dating show Love Island: \u201cBellarosa,\u201d a woman from Essex with conspicuous lip injections. (\u201cI asked the doctor for an allergic reaction,\u201d she said with a wink.) The sketch gave Waller-Bridge room to play around with airy material, and she marked her character\u2019s send-off with a believable nod to Love Island\u2019s true engine: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely gutted,\u201d she cried, before seeing a notification on her phone. \u201cAre you joking? 1.2 million Instagram followers? Well, I don\u2019t have to be a stupid pediatric nurse anymore, do I?\u201d", "description": "The first-time host, fresh off an Emmy sweep for Fleabag, provided a welcome shot of cheeky social commentary on an otherwise uneven episode.", "authors": ["Hannah Giorgis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/NUP_188686_0012/facebook.jpg?1570377503", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
