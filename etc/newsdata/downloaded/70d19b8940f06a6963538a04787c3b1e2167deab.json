It\u2019s a lot of sand,\u201d he later said. \u201cSo you have Syria and you have Turkey. They\u2019re going to argue it out, maybe they\u2019re going to fight it out. But our men aren\u2019t going to get killed over it.\u201d\n\nActing last week after a phone call on Oct. 6 with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Trump abruptly upended five years of U.S. policy with his decision to withhold protection from Syria\u2019s Kurds and to withdraw first about 50 special operations forces and then the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cThis is a mistake worse than what (Barack) Obama did\u201d when the former president withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, Senator Lindsay Graham, usually among Trump\u2019s strongest supporters, told reporters.\n\nU.S. OFFICIALS HEAD TO TURKEY\n\nTrump\u2019s action is widely seen as giving a green light for Turkish forces last week to attack the Syrian Kurdish militia that were Washington\u2019s close allies in the fight against Islamic State militants who once held swathes of Iraq and Syria.\n\nTrump dispatched some of his top aides to Turkey on Wednesday for emergency talks to try to persuade Ankara to halt an assault on northern Syria, while Russian troops swept into territory abandoned by U.S. forces.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien arrived in Turkey aiming to meet Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Wednesday. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hope to meet on Thursday with Erdogan.\n\nThe Turkish leader has insisted there will be no ceasefire, and said he might call off a visit to the United States in November because of the \u201cvery big disrespect\u201d shown by U.S. politicians.\n\nHe also denounced Washington for taking the \u201cunlawful, ugly step\u201d of imposing criminal charges against a Turkish state bank over charges it broke sanctions on Iran. Washington says the case is unrelated to politics.\n\nTurkey\u2019s assault has spawned a humanitarian crisis, with 160,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump, accused by congressional leaders, including fellow Republicans, of betraying loyal U.S. allies, the Kurds.\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nSyrian government forces, backed by Washington\u2019s adversaries Russia and Iran in the more than eight year civil war, have meanwhile taken advantage of the power vacuum left by U.S. troops to advance swiftly into the largest swath of territory previously outside their grasp.\n\nTrump said he thought Pence and Erdogan would have a \u201csuccessful meeting\u201d adding that if they did not, U.S. sanctions and tariffs \u201cwill be devastating to Turkey\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nSenior Republicans voiced dismay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we are where we are,\u201d the characteristically understated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, telling reporters he hoped Pence and Pompeo \u201ccan somehow repair the damage\u201d during their trip to Ankara.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 354 to 60 to condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. forces in a non-binding resolution, with dozens of Republicans joining the majority Democrats in favour.\n\nSANCTIONS\n\nWashington announced sanctions to punish Turkey on Monday, but Trump\u2019s critics said the steps, mainly a steel tariffs hike and a pause in trade talks, were too feeble to have an impact.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors\u2019 charges were unveiled against Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank over allegations it took part in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. Halkbank denies wrongdoing and called the case part of the sanctions against Turkey.\n\nErdogan\u2019s spokesman said Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry was preparing retaliation for U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe Turkish advance, and Washington\u2019s decision to evacuate its own forces, have brought the two biggest militaries in NATO close to confrontation on the battlefield. The United States has complained about Turkish artillery fire near its troops.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said Russian troops had crossed the Euphrates River to advance to Kobani\u2019s outskirts.\n\nLebanon\u2019s al-Mayadeen TV reported that Russian-backed Syrian forces had also set up outposts in Raqqa, the one-time capital of Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, which the Kurds captured in 2017 at the peak of their campaign with U.S. support.\n\nHours after Washington announced its pullout on Sunday, the Kurds made a deal with the government of President Bashar al-Assad.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he had no problem if Russia helped Syria in a conflict with Turkey and rejected criticism of his withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria that exposed Kurdish allies, calling it \"strategically brilliant.\"", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441615767&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F18C", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
