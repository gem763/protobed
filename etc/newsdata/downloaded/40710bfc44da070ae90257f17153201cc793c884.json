As explained by Rock Paper Shotgun, NPCs lost the ability to blink following a SteamPipe update five years ago. They could still blink in scripted moments, but they wouldn\u2019t do it generally. I don\u2019t blame you if you never noticed, but plenty of players did.\n\nNow, we have a solution. NPCs will blink in Half-Life 2, Episode 1 and 2, Lost Coast, and Source. Here\u2019s the G-Man\u2019s opening monologue from 2015.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a grab from this morning:\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a good day.", "description": "In one of the weirder Steam updates, non-player characters in Half-Life 2 and related episodes can now blink, after an update from Valve.", "authors": ["Jackson Ryan", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/jqszrgdgq3oak1n3zzjx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
