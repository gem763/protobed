Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to have the best performance in the fourth Democrat debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening, a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll indicates.\n\nThe poll \u2013 taken October 11-13, 2019 among 1,993 registered voters, 860 of which are likely Democrat primary voters \u2013 found that 31 percent of voters expect the most from the Massachusetts senator during the fourth Democrat debate and predict that she will perform the best. The same poll \u2013 taken in September \u2013 only had 19 percent expecting Warren to perform the best.\n\nBiden came in second, with 25 percent of voters expecting the former vice president to have the best debate performance. Both Warren and Biden topped Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) by double digits. Only 12 percent of respondents expect him to dominate in terms of debate performance. The margin of error for the full survey is +/- 2 percent.\n\nWhile enthusiasm for the debate remains relatively high, with 72 percent indicating that they are \u201cmotivated\u201d to watch Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, that is seven percent down from the September debate.\n\nTuesday\u2019s debate at Otterbein University will feature 12 candidates on the debate stage, making it the \u201clargest televised presidential primary debate ever, regardless of party,\u201d Politico notes.
