Martin, the 36-year-old veteran of 10 postseasons, provided the coda with a towering two-run homer in the ninth, followed by some sage wisdom.\n\n\u201cWho likes being down 0-2? Nobody,\u201d Martin said probably breaking down his at-bat but maybe also life itself.\n\nSo Martin tapped into the information he and his peers acquired earlier. Corbin struck them out nine times and gave up just one earned run in Game 1, when the Dodgers torched Washington\u2019s 29th-ranked bullpen to ensure victory.\n\nTwo days later, down to his last strike, he went to school.\n\n\u201cIn the back of my mind, we had a meeting and we went over Corbin,\u201d says Martin. \u201cAnd with two strikes and guys in scoring positions he doesn't really throw many strikes, he's going to try and make you chase a little bit.\n\n\u201cAnd the more pitches I saw, the more I felt comfortable.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an inning as much as it was a catharsis. NL MVP favorite Cody Bellinger, hitless in eight NLDS at-bats coming in, started the barrage with a single and ended it with a double.\n\nFreese, the 2011 World Series MVP, re-started the rally with a pinch-hit single off Corbin that followed strikeouts by Corey Seager and A.J. Pollock.\n\nHernandez, his role reduced from a 2018 postseason that saw him rack up 41 at-bats, popped off the bench to stretch the lead out with his double.\n\nWhen the playoffs come, the Dodgers more resemble a hockey team, with wholesale line changes coming mid-game once the opposition changes pitchers and they can unleash an unmatched platoon advantage.\n\nFiguring that Corbin might be in the game early, right-handed hitters Freese, Hernandez and Chris Taylor \u2013 who drew a pinch-hit walk after Martin\u2019s double \u2013 stayed busy in the catacombs of Nationals Park.\n\nAs the game began, the action in the batting cage was perhaps livelier than what happened on the field.\n\nThe pitching machine whirred to life. Coaching assistant Jose Vizcaino began tossing batting practice.\n\nAnd as Sanchez held the Dodgers to just Max Muncy\u2019s fifth-inning home run, the right-handed bench mob ambled into the dugout, an eye on the Nationals\u2019 bullpen and an ear toward manager Dave Roberts.\n\nOnce Corbin began lightly tossing in the bullpen, Freese was told to get ready.\n\nA few minutes later, the reinforcements went to work on Corbin. And a club that watched World Series celebrations for the Astros and Red Sox unfold on the Dodger Stadium turf only gained conviction that this year may be different.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys in here who say this is the best team they\u2019ve had the last handful of years,\u201d says Freese, picked up on Aug. 31, 2018 and re-signed before this season.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been around them all, but this is a damn good team.\u201d", "description": "Los Angeles scored seven runs with two outs in the sixth, coming back to beat the Nationals 10-4 and move to the brink of the NLCS.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
