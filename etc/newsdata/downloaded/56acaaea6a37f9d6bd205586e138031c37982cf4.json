Your article about Ramaphosa\u2019s inability to reverse the catastrophe this country has become hit the nail on the head.\n\nMy bigger long term concern is that Cyril\u2019s time is limited \u2013 given the power play within the ANC he could be ousted at any time, even assassinated, the way politicians are being removed these days.\n\nI believe Cyril is the last hope for this country and that he is all that stands between us and a bunch of ANC rogues who, if and when he goes will be the final nail in the coffin. I don\u2019t see any quality leadership coming up through the ranks, and inevitably it will be a free for all, even worse than state capture.\n\nThis is why I will be leaving the shores of this country in the next year or two. No NHI for me!\n\nKeep up the great realistic reporting!\n\nNick French", "description": "I don\u2019t see any quality leadership coming up through the ranks, and inevitably it will be a free for all, even worse than state capture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9334/0931190d7213494d9f92263030b0d4c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
