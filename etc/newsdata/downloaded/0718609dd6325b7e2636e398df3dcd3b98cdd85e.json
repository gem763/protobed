In a statement today, CEO Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter is banning all political ads on its platform worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,\u201d he said, referring to the organic reach someone gets when they post something that goes viral because people like it (or hate it, or \u2026 you know what I mean). Ads, which on social platforms resemble normal posts that an advertiser pays to slip into a user\u2019s feed, get paid reach. On Facebook, pretty much all reach for posts that aren\u2019t from an individual user is paid.\n\nA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money. \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet,\u201d Dorsey continued. \u201cPaying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\u201d Dorsey is, to put it another way, letting political ideas compete unadorned in the marketplace of ideas.\n\nHe also took shots at Facebook and its hands-off policy regarding political ads.\n\nFor instance, it\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want! \ud83d\ude09\u201d \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nThere is \u2026 a lot to unpack here. The implication of this, the winking emoji in particular, posits that Facebook is giving implicit permission to politicians to lie in the ads they pay for and that Facebook reaps the benefit. If I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s probably giving Facebook too much credit. It\u2019s a company whose policies and procedures are often more incompetent than underhanded. Plus, in an earnings call today, Mark Zuckerberg projected that political ads will account for less than 0.5 percent of all of Facebook\u2019s revenue in the coming year.\n\nTo reiterate what I wrote earlier this week, part of what allowed Twitter to make this decision is that it treats all tweets more or less equally, and they all get the same amount of initial exposure. Facebook, on the other hand, treats posts from individual-user accounts (friends and family) and pages (brands) differently. The brands receive far less exposure, unless they pay for it.\n\nThe consequences of this decision are still a large unknown. Facebook is an exponentially more important advertising tool, so maybe not much will change; Zuckerberg himself stated its policy isn\u2019t going to change anytime soon. But Dorsey\u2019s decision might lead to more surreptitious forms of manipulation on Twitter \u2014 bought followers, botnets, artificially inflated post reach. By getting rid of the legitimate advertising option, Twitter clients are left with only the illegitimate ones.\n\nOn its own, though, Dorsey\u2019s decision makes Twitter look like the more competent and thoughtful social-media platform compared with Facebook. Jack Dorsey! Making a hard-line decision about what happens on his platform! There\u2019s a first time for everything.", "description": "Twitter\u2019s CEO decides that politicians shouldn\u2019t be able to pay to give their ideas artificial reach on the platform.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/02/15/15-jack-dorsey.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
