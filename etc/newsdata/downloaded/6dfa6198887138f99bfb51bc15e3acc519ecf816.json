Then this week he sent intimidating text messages to a second woman who accused him of sexual misconduct. The Patriots cut him on Friday.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNot long after he was cut, Brown seemed like he wanted a clean break from his 11-day Patriots career, including giving away the touchdown ball from last week.\n\nAntonio Brown says he\u2019ll give away TD ball\n\nOn Instagram, Brown made quite an offer.\n\nIn very short time there were more than 100,000 comments on that post.\n\nWhatever has and will be said about Brown, it\u2019s a unique bit of memorabilia from one of the weirdest player/team marriages in sports history.\n\nWhat will you remember from the Brown-Patriots era?\n\nBrown\u2019s time with the Patriots will go down alongside the other strange shot-lived eras in sports, like Mike Piazza with the Florida Marlins, Allen Iverson with the Memphis Grizzlies or Brown with the Oakland Raiders.\n\nHere\u2019s the extent of Brown\u2019s Patriots career: one game, 24 snaps, four catches, 56 yards, hardly any money and more headaches than any other player could create in less than two weeks.\n\nOh, and one touchdown. From here on out, whenever Brown\u2019s time with the Patriots is brought up we\u2019ll see that highlight. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s much else to show. Brown seems like he wants to get rid of the memory of that play. Maybe a fan will win it but as we\u2019ve seen with Brown, it\u2019s probably not the best idea to depend on him to follow through on anything.\n\nAntonio Brown scored a touchdown in his Patriots debut, and he said he's giving away the ball after he was cut.
