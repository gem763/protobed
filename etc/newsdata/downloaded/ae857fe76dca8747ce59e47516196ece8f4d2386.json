To mention the other\u2019s name in either man\u2019s company has been akin to feeding a few coins into a jukebox, allowing journalists to simply sit back and listen to the wonderful sound of headlines writing themselves.\n\nBefore England\u2019s visit to Australia in 2016 Cheika predicted that \u201cthere will be a bit of banter when the tour comes and that\u2019s good fun because we both enjoy that\u201d, and scene duly set three years later the coaches are preparing for a World Cup quarter-final that has come to be billed the Battle of the Big Mouths.\n\nEngland lurch back to the future as Eddie Jones gambles on Owen Farrell | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nThe friendship first blossomed at Randwick in Sydney, where Jones played as hooker while Cheika was at No 8 in a team that also included such luminaries as the Ella brothers and another future Wallabies coach, Ewen McKenzie. Though Jones was seven years older, they bonded over a shared status as ethnic interlopers in an establishment sport: Jones\u2019s mother was born in the USA to two Japanese parents while Cheika\u2019s father, Joseph, moved to Australia from Lebanon aged 20. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember this was Australia 30-odd years ago,\u201d Jones said in 2015, while coach of Japan. \u201cIt was still a very white Australia so if you were like Check and myself you really had to prove your worth. Back then there was a bit of racial sledging. Both Check and I had to put up with a bit of that when we played and you had to be able to fire back at opponents on the field. It\u2019s probably a reason why we always got on well.\u201d\n\nUntil his appointment by England Jones had been entirely positive about Cheika \u2013 \u201cI really like what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said four years ago. \u201cHe wears his heart on his sleeve and he\u2019s good for the game.\u201d Fast forward just a few months and with the two about to cross paths for the first time as coaches of serious international rivals, suddenly he was sniffing about \u201csmoke and mirrors everywhere\u201d, saying that Cheika \u201chas a lot of deception about him\u201d, and the banter bus had officially left the station.\n\nRather than wading in, fists flying, Cheika largely skirted around the more distant skirmishes of this nascent war of words. \u201cIf I thought it would have made us play better, yeah I would have got into it,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to people liking me anyway. If they are not big on the way I\u2019ve taken the media campaign then that\u2019s their problem.\u201d\n\nBut after England\u2019s 3-0 win in that series New Zealand\u2019s Steve Hansen accused Cheika of \u201cletting Eddie bully him in the media\u201d, and when Australia travelled to England later that year the 52-year-old finally got his hands dirty. His assertion that Jones \u201chas always operated with a chip on his shoulder and now there isn\u2019t a chip because things are going really well, he keeps looking for it\u201d was a particular highlight. None of this impressed Hansen, who this year jokingly compared Cheika to Mickey Mouse and said it was possible to \u201cget him emotional and take his mind off the job\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eddie Jones and Michael Cheika share a joke at Twickenham in November 2018.

He now holds a 6-0 record against Cheika as England coach, in which context it is perhaps unsurprising that there appears to have been a gentle deterioration in their relationship since they started having to talk about it so much. \u201cWhen I was back in Australia we caught up and had a coffee together. We had a chat about where his team was and where we were as old mates,\u201d was Jones\u2019s merry message when asked about Cheika in November 2017. Exactly a year later the Australia coach painted a slightly frostier picture. \u201cWe\u2019re mates from playing footy together, we\u2019re not swinging hands down the road or anything but we\u2019re friends. There\u2019s no beef between us,\u201d he said. Fast forward another 11 months, and this week Cheika was asked about the latest status of the friendship. \u201cFine,\u201d he replied, tersely. \u201cI don\u2019t see him very much.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\nFor as long as both men remain in post this sometimes venomous rivalry looks certain to simmer, but perhaps that is exactly as the two protagonists would like it. As James Haskell, who has worked with both men, put it this week: \u201cEddie loves revving Cheika up and Cheika loves getting revved up. It\u2019s a perfect formula.\u201d For one of them the World Cup ends on Saturday but off the pitch perhaps they can both find happiness \u2013 with a little help from their friends.", "description": "The England and Australia coaches used to be teammates \u2013 these days they seem to enjoy winding each other up", "authors": ["Simon Burnton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b96d39f711498ee503fde197a7c2eaa32ded62d/0_69_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b8b6d28c1a3eca1e78647b991a09c26", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
