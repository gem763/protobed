Giuliani and the attempts of State Department officials to navigate his activities \u2014 have been largely confirmed by the text messages of three diplomats released Friday, as well as Giuliani himself in media interviews.\n\nIndependent evidence now supports the central elements laid out in the seven-page document. Even if they disregarded the complaint, legal experts said lawmakers have obtained dramatic testimony and documents that provide ammunition for the whistleblower\u2019s core assertion: that the president of the United States used \u201cthe power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve found to date validates the information . . . . It\u2019s brilliantly effective. It really does function almost as a one-stop shop, investigative road map,\u201d said Harry P. Litman, a former U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania who has represented other government whistleblowers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a success story, as whistleblower complaints go,\u201d said Litman, also a contributing columnist for The Washington Post.\n\nWhistleblower painstakingly gathered material and almost single-handedly set impeachment in motion\n\nTrump and his supporters have denied that he abused his office and said there is no evidence that the president engaged in a quid pro quo in which U.S. support for Ukraine was withheld in exchange for Ukrainian officials investigating his political rivals.\n\nAD\n\nDespite the growing body of evidence supporting the whistleblower\u2019s factual narration, Trump has continued to maintain that the description in the complaint is false or unsubstantiated.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Whistleblower\u2019s account of my perfect phone call is \u2018way off,\u2019 not even close,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday morning, adding that Democratic leaders \u201cnever thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this past week, he tweeted, \u201cThe Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critique came even though the president himself admitted nearly two weeks ago that he did indeed discuss former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival, with the Ukrainian president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters then.\n\nIn fact, specific details the whistleblower provided about Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky can be found in the rough transcript of the conversation released by the White House.\n\nAmong them: that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, and that the only specific instance of alleged corruption that Trump referenced on the call was the one pertaining to Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower also accurately described how Trump had asked the Ukrainians to pursue allegations that Russian interference in the 2016 election originated in Ukraine and to \u201cturn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cyber security firm CrowdStrike.\u201d\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump told Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026,\u201d adding, \u201cThe server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nTrump revives a favorite conspiracy theory about the DNC hack\n\nThe whistleblower also said that Trump had explicitly asked the Ukrainians to meet or speak with Giuliani and Barr on these matters, referring to them \u201cmultiple times in tandem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, according to the White House readout. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will figure it out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistleblower, said that the complaint itself noted that it was based both on the whistleblower\u2019s personal knowledge and on information gathered from other officials.\n\nDespite some Republican claims to the contrary, the law that protects government officials who step forward with knowledge of wrongdoing has never required their information be firsthand, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always gratifying when the veracity of a client\u2019s concerns are proven to be true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is obviously disappointing at times to see that something improper might have happened in the government, but there\u2019s a sense of pride in seeing someone stand up for truth and integrity and in seeing the process work to address it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the complaint, the whistleblower described other internal government deliberations that were not public at the time the document was filed.\n\nAD\n\nFor instance, he wrote that he had learned from other officials that Trump instructed Vice President Pence not to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May. Current and former U.S. officials confirmed the president\u2019s directive to The Post earlier this week.\n\nIn addition, the whistleblower asserted that in the weeks before Trump and Zelensky spoke, the Ukrainians were told that a phone call or meeting with the U.S. president \u2014 a highly sought-after mark of respect for the newly elected Ukrainian president \u2014 would depend on whether Zelensky was willing to \u201cplay ball\u201d with Giuliani. And the whistleblower said that he had learned that Giuliani was engaging with Ukrainian officials and relaying messages between Trump and Kiev.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani has acknowledged that he conveyed Trump\u2019s desire for Ukraine to investigate Biden to Ukrainian officials close to Zelensky.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYour country owes it to us and to your country to find out what really happened,\u201d Giuliani told a top aide to the Ukrainian president, according to an interview he gave The Post last month.\n\nHow Trump and Giuliani pressured Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s rivals\n\nLate Thursday night, House investigators released a batch of text messages that buttressed in stark detail the whistleblower\u2019s allegation that the administration was pressuring Ukraine to pursue the political investigations to get a White House meeting and foreign aid.\n\nOne message sent from Kurt Volker, then the special U.S. envoy to Ukraine, to an aide to Zelensky on July 25, hours before Trump and the Ukrainian president spoke, made the terms crystal clear.\n\n\u201cHeard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/ \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker wrote.\n\nAD\n\nIn August, the Ukrainian aide Andrey Yermak told Volker in a text that the Ukrainians would make the public announcements Trump and Giuliani sought in exchange for a meeting date with the U.S. president.\n\n\u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,\u201d Yermak wrote, making a reference to the Ukrainian gas company whose board included Hunter Biden.\n\nVolker told House investigators in closed-door testimony Thursday that he was attempting to repair a relationship between Ukraine and the Trump administration that had been poisoned by unfounded claims Giuliani was feeding Trump.\n\nHolding Ukraine hostage: How the president and his allies, chasing 2020 ammunition, fanned a political storm\n\nAfter the whistleblower filed the complaint in August, the inspector general of the intelligence community assessed that its contents were \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nBehind closed doors, inspector general Michael K. Atkinson has told House lawmakers that he made that assessment after interviewing other witnesses to events that the whistleblower described, according to people familiar with his testimony.\n\nPart of the strength of the whistleblower complaint is that the document carefully flags when its author was sharing information provided by others, as well as instances in which the whistleblower was sharing his suspicions rather than what he knew to be true, said David Colapinto, co-founder of the National Whistleblower Center.\n\n\u201cI think whoever the whistleblower is understood the seriousness of the allegations, understood that it involved the White House, understood that it would get a lot of attention and prepared it carefully with that in mind,\u201d he said.\n\nFor instance, the whistleblower wrote that he learned all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine was suspended in July. The Washington Post reported last month that the unusual directive to hold back the $400 million in money appropriated by Congress came from Trump himself.\n\nThe whistleblower wrote that the delay in the foreign aid \u201cmight have a connection with the overall effort to pressure the Ukrainian leadership.\u201d\n\nBut, he added carefully, \u201cI do not know definitively.\u201d\n\nThe text messages released Thursday showed that other government officials believed there was a direct link.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d wrote Bill Taylor, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to Ukraine, in September to Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nSondland responded that he thought Taylor was \u201cincorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions\u201d and that Trump had been \u201cclear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind\u201d \u2014 before suggesting the two speak by phone instead of in writing.\n\nColapinto noted that it is not the job of the whistleblower to investigate or prove his own complaint. Under the law, a whistleblower need only be able to show he had a \u201creasonable belief\u201d that a violation of law or regulation took place to receive protections from retaliation.\n\nHe said that training material about the whistleblower law for members of the intelligence community specifically includes examples where employees are told of wrongdoing by their a colleague. Employees are told they should flag the wrongdoing in such instances so it can be properly investigated.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how this is supposed to work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rules are supposed to encourage reporting.\u201d\n\nEllen Nakashima and Carol D.
