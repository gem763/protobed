Elizabeth Warren speaks at the New Hampshire Democratic Party state convention in Manchester, September 7, 2019. (Gretchen Ertl/Reuters)\n\nElizabeth Warren wants the social-media giant to certify the truth and falsity of the political ads it runs. She should think the issue through more carefully.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced that Elizabeth Warren is thinking clearly when she says she opposes overweening corporate power, and in particular Facebook\u2019s overweening corporate power:\n\nFacebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you\u2014even about Facebook itself\u2014while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 12, 2019\n\nWhat would Warren have Facebook do? She would have it vet and reject ads for truth:\n\nYou\u2019re making my point here. It\u2019s up to you whether you take money to promote lies. You can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards. In fact, those standards were in your policy. Why the change? https://t.co/CE766Jpwoo \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 13, 2019\n\nWarren\u2019s complaint appears as one respectable elite liberal appealing to the elite liberal executives and managers inside Facebook. The message? You need to play for your own team here, even if it costs you something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe interesting question is how the standard Warren is demanding of Facebook would play out in real life. It might very well work against the goal she desires. Unscrupulous campaigns could still flood social-media sites like Facebook with ads, daring them to take the political risk of cracking down. Worse, her opponents\u2019 ads could effectively use Facebook\u2019s fact-checking as a kind of character witness for their attacks. How would it look for her if Facebook, the progressive behemoth with apparently immense sway over our elections, was seen to be endorsing and certifying Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on her?\n\nWarren says that \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once through negligence.\u201d This is not knowably true, though liberals and progressives have done their best to claim otherwise since Trump\u2019s election. In 2008 and 2012, Democrats were thrilled that Barack Obama was able to use Facebook very effectively, often exploiting the same technique s they deplored and viewed as conspiratorial when used on a smaller scale by groups aligned with the right. A decade ago, progressives fantasized about social-media-powered revolutions of the young across the world. In the years since, the median age of a Facebook user has gone up dramatically, and now resembles the median age of a Donald Trump voter. Trump won the election, and we know that voters and his campaign interacted across Facebook during the campaign that preceded it. But it is still difficult, if not impossible, to determine how much Facebook caused his election to happen and how much it simply reflected his ascent.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s certain is that the resulting controversy has not helped either our politics or Facebook\u2019s public image (and thus its bottom line). Warren\u2019s standard would have the potential to make future such controversies even more intense. Facebook\u2019s certification of political ads would involve the company in more controversial political judgements and events, not fewer. To progressives who believe history\u2019s arc bends in their direction by right, it would make Facebook appear more guilty when democracy threw up a surprise result. And it would arguably make the platform more powerful and desirable as a political ad space, which is an odd goal for an avowed opponent of corporate power to pursue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook\u2019s team has responded to Warren\u2019s attacks on Twitter, arguing that its current standard is analogous to FEC guidelines, which discourage broadcasters from censoring ads and encourage voters to decide. That is, in rough terms, the right approach. A democratic people should not want gigantic corporations that have Facebook\u2019s insidious and omnipresent reach certifying the truth and falsity of political claims. If we want democratic citizens to be skeptical of both corporate and political claims, then those claims should continue to travel under the names of \u201cspin\u201d and \u201cboob bait\u201d and we should stop pretending that Mark Zuckerberg can assemble a reliable truth squad.\n\nAdjudicating campaign claims in a democratic system should be messy, decentralized, and oppositional. It shouldn\u2019t be a duty entrusted to the corporations that have done the most to addict us to their products and capture our errant attention.", "description": "Adjudicating campaign claims in a democratic system should be messy, decentralized, and oppositional.
