But a review of budget plans in a dozen capitals suggests politicians aren\u2019t stepping up particularly fast \u2013- even though it\u2019s cheap or free to borrow on bond markets.\n\nThat spells more bad news for global growth. The International Monetary Fund this week predicted the weakest expansion in a decade amid the U.S.-China trade war, and warned that budget chiefs in major economies \u201cshould be prepared for coordinated action in case of a severe downturn.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s a missed opportunity, according to a recent study by Oxford Economics. It found that in almost all large developed countries, and some of the main emerging markets too, spending an additional 1% of gross domestic product would deliver more than that amount of growth for each economy -\u2013 and have knock-on benefits for others too.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\n\n\u201cWith growth fading, monetary policy space depleted, and borrowing costs low, the obvious solution is fiscal stimulus. In various configurations, fractious politics, institutional constraints and high debt make the obvious solution difficult to deliver.\u2019\u2019-- Tom Orlik, chief economist\n\nFollowing is an overview of the fiscal state of play in the world\u2019s most important economies.\n\nIt\u2019s harder to track budget stimulus than the monetary kind, because taxes and spending happen at both national and local levels. The headline numbers below are from the latest IMF Fiscal Monitor, published this week, and may differ from those provided by finance ministries.\n\nU.S.: Tax Cuts 2.0? Probably Not\n\n2019 Forecast: -5.6% of GDP (deficit)2020 Forecast: -5.5%\n\nPresident Donald Trump juiced the economy last year with a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts along with increases in spending, especially for the military. But the effect has petered out in 2019, and concern that the economy could slide into recession is mounting.\n\nTrump, who\u2019s up for re-election in a year\u2019s time, has held out the prospect of more stimulus. Last month, he promised \u201cvery substantial\u201d tax cuts in 2020 that would benefit \u201cmiddle-income\u201d Americans -- maybe a nod to the widespread view among economists that the last round favored the wealthy. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin referred to \u201cTax Cuts 2.0.\u201d\n\nLittle more has been heard of the idea. Trump\u2019s comment coincided with the start of a televised debate among his Democratic rivals, and the fact he\u2019s dropped similar hints before without following up has left many analysts skeptical. In any case, Trump\u2019s Republicans lost control of the House at the end of last year. So any new package would need support from Democratic lawmakers whose spending priorities are different.\n\n\u201cThe chance of additional fiscal stimulus being incorporated ahead of the 2020 election is remote, given the nearly insurmountable hurdle of crafting a package that would appeal to both House Democrats and Senate Republicans -- particularly given the increasingly toxic climate amid impeachment investigations.\u201d-- Carl Riccadonna, Bloomberg Economics\n\nChina: Trade-War Defenses\n\n2019 Forecast: -6.1% (deficit)2020 Forecast: -6.3%\n\nChina rolled out tax cuts on personal income and corporate profits early this year that are estimated to be worth 2 trillion yuan ($280 billion), and Finance Minister Liu Kun said last month that they\u2019ve had a bigger than expected impact.\n\nThe central government\u2019s budget only captures part of what policy makers are doing to stimulate the economy. The IMF figures also include spending by local authorities. China has been allowing them to issue more off-balance-sheet debt this year to pay for infrastructure.\n\nWith officials keen to offset the trade war\u2019s impact on growth, fiscal stimulus is likely to continue, but the swelling deficit will eventually crimp their options.\n\n\u201cChina has more fiscal space compared to many major economies. Fiscal support is likely to continue to play an important role in stabilizing growth in 2020. The government is seen to focus on infrastructure spending and implementing the tax cut plans announced this year.\u201d-- Chang Shu, Bloomberg Economics", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Governments are failing to heed the pleas of their central bankers for more spending to support a slowing world economy.Monetary policy makers say they\u2019re running out of room to cut interest rates, which are already at historic lows, and it\u2019s time for their fiscal counterparts to take", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.CJbpmv62jyMrEZfUaT0NQ--~B/aD04OTQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/fcaa35b74141bf2e4dc9f870ddc533da", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
