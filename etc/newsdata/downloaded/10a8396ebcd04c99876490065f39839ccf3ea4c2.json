The singer recently spoke to British GQ to promote his new memoir Me and was asked for his thoughts on Disney\u2019s remake of The Lion King \u2014 since, after all, he originally gave us such hits as \u201cThe Circle of Life.\u201d \u201cThe new version of The Lion King was a huge disappointment to me, because I believe they messed the music up,\u201d he said. Why don\u2019t you tell us how you really feel, Sir Elton? \u201cMusic was so much a part of the original and the music in the current film didn\u2019t have the same impact. The magic and joy were lost.\u201d But John may have forgotten that he co-wrote most of the remake\u2019s new music, including the hit \u201cSpirit.\u201d (Although he had nothing to do with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s curated album The Gift.) \u201cI wish I\u2019d been invited to the party more, but the creative vision for the film and its music was different this time around and I wasn\u2019t really welcomed or treated with the same level of respect,\u201d he added. \u201cThat makes me extremely sad.\u201d\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough to get the Beyhive sent after him, elsewhere in the interview John claimed, \u201cThe only real star at the moment is Lady Gaga.\u201d He only invoked Beyonc\u00e9 by name as an example of how the American press \u201ctreat[s] everyone like royalty.\u201d Because she\u2019s the closest thing we have to it! Just let Beyonc\u00e9 await her Oscar in peace.", "description": "Composer of the soundtrack for the original Lion King movie, Elton John said Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s remake did not live up to his standards.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/16/16-elton-john-beyonce.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
