Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, who received a high-paying position on a Ukrainian energy company\u2019s board while his father oversaw the Obama administration\u2019s Ukraine policy.\n\nThe hidden-camera investigation showed Mr. Zucker pushing the network to be \u201cfully committed\u201d to the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment push, which has received extensive coverage from virtually all national media outlets.\n\nMr. Chalian said that \u201cas big of a story as what President Trump has done here is the Republicans sort of either delusional or defiant or silent responses.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, is that okay?\u201d asked Mr. Chalian. \u201cAnd if they say no today, we should have a camera in front of them again and ask them tomorrow because it is not okay.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: Secretly recorded 9am editorial call reveals @CNN President Jeff Zucker and Political Director David Chalian discussing a strategy of getting in the faces of Republican Senators and harassing them for comments on a daily basis, be it at home or on the Hill.#ExposeCNN pic.twitter.com/RR72wZXmRV \u2014 James O\u2019Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 17, 2019\n\nA number of Republicans have said they disagreed with Mr. Trump bringing up Hunter Biden on the July 25 phone call, but that the conversation, the basis of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment push, falls well short of an impeachable offense.\n\nRepublicans have also said that the transcript released by the White House that shows no quid pro quo, while Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, said that the president\u2019s focus was on possible Ukrainian election meddling.\n\n\u201cThere is potential interference in the 2016 election. That\u2019s what Trump wants to get to the bottom of, but the press doesn\u2019t want to,\u201d said Mr. Johnson last week on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nSen.
