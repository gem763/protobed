However, it is resistant to several drugs, including methicillin and penicillin, making it harder to treat.\n\nDoctors hope the test could allow doctors to dish out the correct treatment more quickly by identifying if an infection is drug resistant.\n\nCurrently available tests take \u2018up to two days\u2019 to determine whether an infection can fight off some types of the drugs\n\nThe study, published in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics, comes amid the ever-growing threat of superbugs.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is deemed to be one of the biggest threats facing humanity, alongside climate change and terrorism.\n\nAround 700,000 people already die yearly due to drug-resistant infections \u2013 but it is estimated this will dramatically increase in the next few decades.\n\nThe test contains a sensor, which acts like a mini Petri-dish that is coated with an antibiotic to test whether the bacteria can grow in its presence.\n\nLead author Dr Stuart Hannah said the rapid detection means doctors could quickly spot whether the patient has a bacterial or viral infection.\n\nThis would then allow doctors to make sure the correct antibiotic is prescribed, or stop them from unnecessarily dishing out antibiotics, which are useless against viruses such as influenza.\n\nBacteria can become resistant when people take incorrect doses of antibiotics, or they are given out unnecessarily.\n\nDr Hannah said: \u2018There is a small difference between what makes an organism susceptible to an antibiotic and what makes it resistant.\n\n\u2018In real terms, we were able to distinguish between the two strains in less than 45 minutes, which is a significant improvement on the current gold standard of up to two days.\u2019\n\nHe added that antibiotic resistance is less likely to develop if you give a narrower spectrum antibiotic.\n\nIt is now hoped the test could eventually be used by pharmacists and other points of care, as well as being developed for commercial use.\n\nDr Hannah suggested all the materials used \u2018can be mass manufactured, which means that it is cheap to produce a working test\u2019.\n\nHe added that, \u2018with the right commercial backing\u2019, a future device could be used at a GP surgery or even on an intensive care ward.\n\nCritically-ill patients are \u2018quite rightly\u2019 given a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloaxcin, Dr Hannah said.\n\n\u2018We would hope that the test can be located at the bedside and that it will allow doctors to switch from a broad spectrum agent to the right drug quite quickly.\u2019\n\nDr David Alcorn, also involved the study published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics, said: \u2018Being able to quickly diagnose an infection is a great enough ability.\n\n\u2018But to be able to also detect AMR (antimicrobial resistance) within such a short period of time could prove to be a wonderful tool.\n\n\u2018It means vital diagnostic information could be provided for clinicians across intensive care units, operating theatres, and emergency departments, to enable them to give the right drug at the right time.\u2019\n\nFigures estimate about a third of the population carry S. aureus, and that up to three per cent harbour MRSA.", "description": "The new method, developed by experts at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, was tested on staphylococcus aureus and MRSA.", "authors": ["Stephen Matthews Health Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20078462-0-image-a-3_1571840532790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
