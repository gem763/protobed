Liberal groups, child welfare agencies, and some judges are acting under the belief that the child welfare system is racially biased and structured to break up minority families rather than protect kids.\n\nRiley reports:\n\nPrime movers of the effort are the Casey Family Programs, a national philanthropy organization with a $2.2 billion endowment, and a New Orleans judge, Ernestine Steward Gray.\n\nWith family court records sealed, Gray\u2019s activism on the bench is wreaking havoc with the youngest residents of Orleans Parish, some child advocates say.\n\nLately reports of child abuse and neglect there have almost doubled, while the number of children sent to foster care fell almost 75%.\n\nIn 2013, a 5-year-old old in the parish, Brandajah Smith, grabbed a .38 revolver in her home and took her own life. She had not been removed from the home despite indications she was sexually abused and had become fixated on the gun, her own death, and heaven.\n\nJudge Gray contends black kids nationally are \u201cdisproportionately represented\u201d in the child welfare system because of racial bias.\n\nGray says research \u201cshows that rates of child abuse and neglect are not higher in families of color.\u201d\n\nNational statistics report, however, that black children are more likely to suffer maltreatment.\n\nGray\u2019s high-stakes experiment may be in violation of federal equal-protection law.\n\nThe difference between removing imperiled children to foster care and keeping them in their homes is stark, says James Dwyer, a law professor at the College of William & Mary. \u201cWe know that a substantial portion of parents reported once for maltreatment will be reported again if the child remains in their custody,\u201d Dwyer says. But \u201cwe know rates of abuse and neglect in foster care are miniscule by comparison \u2014 one quarter of 1% annually.\u201d\n\nRead Full Article\n\nHow Many Spy Targets Were There in Russiagate? One ... or Four?\n\nRealClearInvestigations\n\nA little-publicized Capitol Hill exchange suggests that three Trump campaign figures besides Carter Page may have been the targets of FISA-approved surveillance \u2013 Gen. Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort and George Papadopolous. Eric Felten reports for RealClearInvestigations that this would be especially significant because Flynn and Manafort were high-level figures in constant contact with Trump. Felten also reports:\n\nDuring an interview with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch last December, Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee mentioned the four men and said, \u201cOne thing that all of these persons had in common was that each was the subject of a FISA court investigation.\u201d\n\nAt the same interview, Rep. Jim Jordan made the same claim. After a lawyer objected to any talk about classified \u201cFISA applications,\u201d Jordan backed off.\n\nIn his book, Papadopoulos writes that reporters told him he was under FISA scrutiny.\n\nBecause the four men were targets of counterintelligence investigations, it would be unlikely that the government hadn\u2019t sought FISA warrants.\n\nUnder FISA\u2019s \u201ctwo hop\u201d rule, agents can spy not only on the target, but anyone in contact with the target (hop one) and anyone communicating with those contacts (hop two). This latter suggests that Trump may not have been far off when he alleged that the Obama administration had his \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before his victory.\n\nThe Trump Investigations: Top Articles\n\nPelosi Announces Trump-Ukraine Impeachment inquiry, Washington Post\n\nIn Ukraine Phone Call, Alarmed Aides Saw Trouble, New York Times\n\nWhistleblower Exceeds Mueller in Making Case, Washington Post\n\nRepubs Want Whistleblower's Sources, as Inconsistencies Emerge, Fox\n\nWhistleblower's Lawyer Group Pays Trump Snitches, Washington Examiner\n\nOnce-Secret Memos Cast Doubt on Joe Biden's Ukraine Story, The Hill\n\nFlashback, July '19: Hunter Biden's Risk to Dad's Campaign, New Yorker\n\nDemocrats Were First to Enlist Ukraine in U.S. Elections, The Hill\n\nFlashback '17: Clinton-Tied Kiev Dirt vs. Trump, Politico\n\nFirsthand Rule Secretly Deleted on Intel-Whistleblowing Form, Federalist\n\n\n\nOther Noteworthy Articles and Series\n\nJourney of Tainted Vape Cartridge: China's Labs to Your Lungs\n\nLeafly\n\nAlthough mainstream vaping companies like Juul are under fire because of health issues connected to vaping, many of those problems are connected to counterfeit marijuana products, many of which are made in China and then sold to unwitting customers. This article unpacks the supply chain while reporting on the thriving black market in marijuana. Recent reports have estimated that America\u2019s legal, regulated cannabis industry accounts for only 22% of the nation\u2019s $52 billion in cannabis purchases. The other 78% of the THC market remains untested and out of control. Near the end of 2018, a new additive entered the street THC vape cartridge supply: a form of vitamin E oil used as a cutting agent. And hundreds of serious pulmonary injuries, and possibly as many as nine deaths, followed.\n\nResettled Migrant Kids Divide Minnesota Farm Town\n\nWashington Post\n\nSince 2017, more than 270,000 unaccompanied minors have crossed into the U.S. along the southern border. Some of them have ended up in Worthington, Minnesota, a community of 13,000 that has received more unaccompanied minors per capita than almost anywhere in the country. This influx is causing a backlash. Five times in just over five years, the school district has asked residents to approve an expansion to handle the surge in enrollment. Five times, the voters have refused \u2014 the last time by a margin of just 17 votes. A sixth referendum is scheduled for November. This article reports that the divide can be felt all over Worthington, where \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d has devolved into \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d window signs, boycotts on businesses and next-door neighbors who no longer speak. A Catholic priest who praised immigrants was booed from the pews and has received death threats. But this being the Washington Post, it blames the complicated forces at work on \u201cwhite farmers in this Trump-supporting county.\u201d\n\nDem Clerk Charged With Altering Election Ballots in Michigan\n\nNational Review\n\nA Democratic city clerk in a Detroit suburb who had been honored by the state party for her work was charged with multiple felonies for allegedly throwing 193 valid ballots in the trash in a 2018 race between two Democratic candidates. The clerk is on is on paid administrative leave until she can be tried.\n\nWhen Rides Go Wrong, Uber Investigators Put Company First\n\nWashington Post\n\nUber has a team of nearly 80 specialized workers who grapple with some of the worst incidents that happen in Uber rides. But, this article reports, when they make a determination, \u201cinvestigators are coached by Uber to act in the company\u2019s interest first, ahead of passenger safety.\u201d The agents, for example, are forbidden by Uber from routing allegations to police or from advising victims to seek legal counsel or make their own police reports, even when they get confessions of felonies, said Lilli Flores, a former investigator in Phoenix \u2014 a guideline corroborated in interviews with investigators, alleged victims and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys.\n\nCustomer Cards Make Starbucks $1.6B Monetary Giant\n\nMoneyness\n\nStarbucks customers may be paying more than they think for their \u201ctriple, venti, non-fat, caramel macchiato.\u201d That\u2019s because they hold about $1.6 billion that customers have put on Starbucks cards and other credits with the chain. Starbucks markets the cards as an easy way to make a purchase (neglecting to mention that swiping a debit or credit card is easy too). They also represent a big interest-free loan to Starbucks. In fairness, PayPal makes Starbucks look like a piker in the float game. Its customers have about $20 billion in interest free balances just sitting in their accounts. PayPal is required to store customer's funds in a segregated account at a bank, or invest them in government bonds so unfortunately for PayPal, it can\u2019t maximize its earnings on the funds that customers have lent it. Still, it ain\u2019t nothing.", "description": "RealClearInvestigations' Picks of the Week Sept. 22 to Sept. 28, 2019 \nFeatured Investigations: The Race Theory That Keeps Imperiled Black Kids Right Where They Are\nThere\u0092s a racially...", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/rcinv-home-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
