That happened even as closures declined.\n\nDriving the news: The S&P 500 has outperformed the average hedge fund by more than 100% since 2009, according to an Axios analysis.\n\nPutting $100,000 in an S&P 500 index fund with a fee of 10 basis points would yield $301,489 at the end of 2019's first quarter. That same $100,000 invested in the average hedge fund would return $174,787.\n\nHedge fund managers are also eating away at their clients' money with expensive fees.\n\nWhile fees for the average index fund have been fast approaching zero, with some firms even offering negative-fee products, hedge funds still charge an average of 1.45% management fees and 17% of returns for performance fees.\n\nYes, but: Some top hedge funds with market-beating records have been able to increase fees.\n\nThe bottom line: Plunging share prices and volatility late last year were heralded as a moment for hedge funds to shine, but instead the industry saw the highest outflows since the fourth quarter of 2016.", "description": "They've been delivering returns far worse than the broader stock market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/xiK9St3wM_qLg-ujD7A5HI9qdmI=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/04/24/1556140122205.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-25"}
