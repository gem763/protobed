Sandy Hooper, USA TODAY\n\nWith the Summer Olympics in Tokyo now just a year away \u2014 the opening ceremony is July 24, 2020 \u2014 the preparations for the Games is in full swing.\n\nSeveral new sports will be joining the Summer Olympics roster, with karate, skateboarding, surfing and sport climbing making their debut, while baseball and softball make a return after a two-Games absence. In all, there will be 33 sports competed in at the Tokyo Games, with about 5,000 medals set to be won.\n\nHere is some key information to know, from how to acquire tickets (good luck) to important dates and other frequently asked questions.\n\nFUTURE STARS?: 15 Americans who could become stars in Tokyo\n\nKey dates\n\nThe Olympics run July 24 until Aug. 9. Softball and soccer get underway before the official opening, with matches schedule July 22. Rowing and archery begin on the day of the opening ceremony with medal rounds the next day.\n\nSome of the new sports will be featured early: skateboarding and 3-on-3 basketball starting on the second day.\n\nTime zone difference\n\nTokyo is 13 hours ahead of America\u2019s East Coast, but NBC will again live stream countless hours and events. At the 2012 Olympics in London, NBC live streamed 3,500 hours of competition, the first time all Olympic events were streamed. Then in 2016, NBC live streamed 4,500 hours of competition, covering each event live.\n\nTicket information\n\nAbout 70% of available tickets have been reserved for Japanese residents. Tickets are currently only available through authorized ticket resellers \u2014 CoSport is the lone distributor for the U.S. \u2014 but scores of tickets are sold out already for the initial distribution phase.\n\nA second lottery phase will open in August for residents on Japan after 7.5 million people completed the Tokyo 2020 ID registration. It\u2019s unclear exactly when more tickets will be available in the U.S., but any unsold tickets still around in spring 2020 will be sold worldwide on a first-come, first-served basis, at the same prices offered in Japan.\n\nCoSport opened the ticket request phase May 9 and closed it at the end of the month. Live ticket sales began July 9 and continue, with select sports still available, such as weight lifting, basketball and handball. Opening and closing ceremonies are sold out.\n\nAuthorized ticket resellers can also apply hefty fees along with the ticket purchase. For instance, a basketball ticket for July 26, 2020 at Saitama Super Arena in category A \u2014 tickets are sold in price categories rather than seat sections \u2014 has a face value of 24,500 yen ($237.73). The handling fee applied by CoSport is $47.55, an extra 20% onto the ticket\u2019s face value, bringing the overall ticket price to $298.44. Want it shipped to your house? That\u2019ll be another $35.\n\nVenues\n\nJapan last hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964 (Sapporo and Nagano hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972 and 1998, respectively), and some of the same historic venues from the last Tokyo Games will be used this time around. The Nippon Budokan, used for the judo competition in 1964, will once again hold judo events, as well as karate.\n\nTokyo is constructing just eight new venues. The other 35 are existing buildings, with some receiving renovations or the addition of temporary stands to make them fit for the Olympics.\n\nMore: Shaun White says he's going to world skateboarding championships, gauging Tokyo Olympics\n\nMore: Katie Ledecky withdraws from 2 events at world championships due to illness\n\nOne of those new buildings will host the opening and closing ceremonies. The new Tokyo National Stadium will be completed in November, with a 60,102 capacity. The stadium will also host the women\u2019s soccer final.\n\nWith a few exceptions,venues are in the Tokyo Bay Zone or Heritage Zone. The latter area is in central Tokyo, with many venues used in 1964. The Tokyo Bay Zone has most of the new facilities.\n\nMascot\n\nMiraitowa, a blue-and-white checkerboarded animal-like being with ears resembling those of a fox, got its name by mixing two Japanese words together: mirai (future) and towa (eternity).\n\nMiraitowa was one of three finalists and selected by classes of Japanese primary school children.\n\nMiraitowa, the mascot for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, holds an Olympic torch during a ceremony marking one year before the start of the games in Tokyo on July 24, 2019.

Plus, Lebron James hasn\u2019t ruled out an appearance.\n\nFor men\u2019s swimming, Caeleb Dressel could prove to be the next multi-medalist for the U.S. At the 2017 World Championships, Dressel won seven gold medals. And Noah Lyles has all the makings of a future star on the track, while five-time Olympic medalist Justin Gatlin looks set to appear in one more Games.\n\nOlympic expenses\n\nHosting the Summer Olympics is costly, even with many of the stadiums and venues already built. According to the Associated Press, Tokyo is spending at least $20 billion, with 70% of that taxpayer money.\n\nThe new national stadium costs $1.25 billion and won\u2019t be ready for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan as originally planned because the original stadium plans were scrapped once costs soared to around $2 billion.\n\nThe Olympic Village, built alongside Tokyo Bay, is another pricey project that remained despite efforts to lower costs.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported Paris\u2019 2024 Summer Olympics will cost $8 billion and Los Angeles in 2028 is projected at $7 billion, making Tokyo\u2019s budget seem more extreme.", "description": "Ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympics, here is key information, from how to acquire tickets to important dates and other frequently asked questions.", "authors": ["Andy Kostka", "Usa Today", "Published A.M.
