Judges, whom we insulate from politics, have no constitutional responsibility for national defense. It is supposed to be left to the elected officials accountable to the people whose lives are at stake.\n\nThere is wisdom in making national-security decisions political rather than legal. The law strives for rigorous logic, a one-size-fits-all balancing of public-safety concerns against individual rights. Over time, judges reliably expand both the ambit of these rights and the categories of entitled individuals \u2014 to include even non-Americans who bear no responsibilities of citizenship, and even enemies who make war on Americans.\n\nPolitics, by contrast, strives for social cohesion through compromise. It is not bound by logic but by public perception \u2014 in security matters, the perception of a threat\u2019s severity and of the reasonableness of responsive measures. Security measures should be ratcheted up in a time of high alert, particularly in wartime; but they should ebb as our sense of vulnerability wanes, as priorities other than our protection seem more urgent.\n\nRight now, we are in the ebbing phase. For nearly two decades, we\u2019ve longed for that. But is it here because it\u2019s time, or because we long for it?", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Mccarthy", "Nationalreview.Com"], "top_image": ""}
