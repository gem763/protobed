(Antonio Brown/Instagram)\n\nInterestingly, Brown enrolled in classes at the school last week before he was cut by the New England Patriots, according to McMann. A spokesperson for the school confirmed Brown is enrolled in four online classes but also made it clear Brown does not attend classes on a CMU campus.\n\nOn Brown\u2019s schedule? Introduction to Management, Technical Writing, Death and Dying (a religion course) and Racism and Equality (a sociology course).\n\nHopefully, none of those classes require his attention on Tuesday morning as he is scheduled to appear in a Miami-Dade County courtroom for a deposition for a civil lawsuit against him for destroying a Florida condo last year, The Detriot Free Press reports.\n\nThat civil lawsuit is not to be confused with the one which Brown\u2019s former trainer Britney Taylor filed against him less than two weeks ago. In the suit, Taylor, who met Brown while she was also attending CMU, alleges Brown sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions.\n\nThe NFL is investigating Taylor\u2019s claims as well as those of another woman who accused Brown of engaging in sexual misconduct at his home while she was there painting a mural. Brown\u2019s threatening text messages to the second woman were the final straw in his dismissal from the Patriots.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Brown tweeted he is done with the NFL on Sunday.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "On Brown's schedule?
