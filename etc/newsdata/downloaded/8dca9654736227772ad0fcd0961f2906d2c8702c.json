Naturally, it was very confusing.\n\nTrump connected with Meir just before 12:30 PM ET on Friday, as she was working on the International Space Station\u2019s exterior with Koch. The two women were nearing their fifth hour outside the station.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be speaking live with two brave American astronauts who are making history and joining us during their spacewalk,\u201d Trump said during the livestreamed call, which started somewhat normally. The President was seated with his daughter Ivanka Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine.\n\nTrump seemed to be confused about the nature of the event, announcing that \u201cthis is the first time for a woman outside of the space station,\u201d and repeating seconds later that it was \u201cthe first-ever female spacewalk.\u201d\n\nMany women have performed spacewalks, or extravehicular activities (EVAs). Cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya was the first woman ever to conduct an EVA in 1984. NASA astronaut Kathryn Sullivan became the first American woman spacewalker later the same year.\n\nKoch and Meir are the first all-woman crew to perform an EVA, however.\n\nMeir took the opportunity to clarify the historic milestone. \u201cFirst of all, we don\u2019t want to take too much credit, because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, this is really just us doing our jobs,\u201d Meir continued. \u201cWe were the crew that was tasked with this assignment. At the same time, we recognize that it is a historic achievement and we do of course want to give credit to all those who came before us. There have been a long line of female scientists, explorers, engineers, and astronauts, and we have followed in their footsteps to get us where we are today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also hope we can provide an inspiration to everybody\u2014not only women, but to everybody\u2014that has a big dream and is willing to work hard to make that dream come true,\u201d she concluded.\n\nTrump complimented Meir and Koch and told them to \u201chave a good time\u201d before ending the brief call.", "description": "NASA astronaut Jessica Meir corrected the President, who seemed to think this was the first time women had ever performed a spacewalk, while making history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da9f219419dca0009af777f/lede/1571418674129-Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-123217-PM.png?crop=1xw:0.9081898984198645xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
