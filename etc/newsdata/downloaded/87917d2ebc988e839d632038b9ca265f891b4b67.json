McCarthy said Wednesday in a written statement. \u201cWe must ensure it can honor those we have lost for many years to come.\u201d\n\nMr. McCarthy announced a plan to restrict burial eligibility at Arlington to preserve the cemetery\u2019s shrinking number of gravesites for future generations. The Army estimates the cemetery will run out of space in the 2050s if no changes are made.\n\nThe plan calls for reserving burial sites for the remains of Medal of Honor recipients, former prisoners of war, personnel killed in action, recipients of awards for valor, veterans who matriculate to high-ranking government posts, presidents and vice presidents. The cremated remains of other veterans could still rest at Arlington in above-ground urns.\n\nCurrently, service members who retire from active duty and are eligible for retirement pay automatically are eligible for burial at Arlington. About 22 million living service members and veterans are eligible for burial at Arlington, the Army said.\n\nMore than 400,000 people are buried in the cemetery, and only 95,000 burial spaces remain, though a planned expansion will add 37 acres of burial space and more than 10 years of life to the cemetery under the existing rules.\n\nThe American Legion acknowledged \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d to lengthen Arlington National Cemetery\u2019s lifespan, but the legion \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s largest war veterans groups \u2014 called on the Army to do more.\n\n\u201cSimple restrictions is not the only answer, and we also call on the Army to incorporate ways to maximize existing space while considering expansion of the cemetery to allow for more veterans to rest on this hallowed ground,\u201d American Legion National Commander James W. \u201cBill\u201d Oxford said in a statement to The Washington Times.\n\nThe proposed rules will now go through the federal rule-making process and published in the Federal Register. The rules could go into effect within nine months if no comments require that the rules be revised. The Army already has received feedback in a survey from more than 250,000 people over the last two years. The Army says roughly three-quarters of respondents have favored restricting burial eligibility.\n\nA spokesperson for Arlington National Cemetery did not respond to request for comment.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs oversees 137 cemeteries in 40 states and 33 soldier\u2019s lots and monument sites. A number of states maintain veterans\u2019 cemeteries, as well.\n\nBut the Army administers and manages the 624 acres of Arlington National Cemetery, with its white tombstones on sprawling greenery adjacent to the Potomac River in Virginia. The Army\u2019s 3rd Infantry Regiment conducts funerals at Arlington and provides 24-hour guard of the cemetery\u2019s Tomb of the Unknown Solider.\n\nThe cemetery\u2019s founding dates to the Civil War, when Union soldiers commandeered the estate of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee overlooking the Potomac River and the nation\u2019s capital to bury the war dead.\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
