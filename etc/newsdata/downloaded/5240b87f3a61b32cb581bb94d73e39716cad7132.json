(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nFRIPP ISLAND, S.C. \u2014 A family visiting South Carolina fished a big package from the ocean, took it to their rental home and opened it up, finding about 44 pounds (20 kilograms) of cocaine.\n\nBeaufort County Sheriff's Maj. Bob Bromage told news outlets Monday that the family was walking along Fripp Island when they spotted the trash bag-wrapped package floating in the water.\n\nThey dragged it onto the beach and lugged it to their rental in a golf cart, later slicing it open to discover bricks of white powder. At that point, they figured they'd better call police.\n\nAuthorities assessed the cocaine's value at more than $600,000. Officials are working to determine its origin.\n\nBromage said narcotics don't frequently wash up in the county. He thinks Hurricane Dorian, which hit the U.S. coast in early September, may have pushed it ashore.\n\nFripp Island is a barrier island north of Hilton Head and is a popular vacation destination.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/09/south-carolina-vacation-family-fishes-cocaine-ocean-fripp-island/3918074002/", "description": "A family visiting Fripp Island, South Carolina, sliced open a big package they fished from the ocean and discovered bricks of cocaine.", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Published A.M.
