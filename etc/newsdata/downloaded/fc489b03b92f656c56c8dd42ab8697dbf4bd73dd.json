Position a rack to the center of the oven and preheat it to 325\u00b0F.\n\n2. In a Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Season the brisket liberally with salt and pepper. Sear until golden, about 4 minutes per side.\n\n3. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, sauerkraut, applesauce, and dark brown sugar.\n\n4. Lay the onions over the brisket, and pour the sauce over the top. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cover tightly and cook for 3 to 3 1/2 hours, or until tender, turning every 45 minutes. During the last 45 minutes of cooking, crack the lid so the sauce can reduce a bit. Remove the brisket to a cutting board and let rest for 15 minutes before slicing.\n\nSweet & Spicy Fall Fruit Salad\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\n2 medium apples\n\n1 medium firm, ripe pear\n\n2 Fuyu persimmons\n\n1 large orange\n\n1 large pink grapefruit\n\n1/2 cup pomegranante seeds\n\n1/4 cup dark brown sugar\n\n1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n\n1/8 teaspoon cardamom\n\n3 whole cloves\n\n1 star anise\n\nPinch of fine sea salt\n\n1. Core the apples and pears, and cut the tops off the persimmons, and cut into 3/4-inch chunks. Place in a large serving bowl. Using a sharp knife, remove the peel and the pith from both the orange and the grapefruit. Holding the peeled fruit over a small saucepan so that any juice drips into the pan, cut the sections from both the orange and grapefruit by slicing between the thin white lines of membrane, leaving the membrane and any other pith behind. Place the sections into the bowl and squeeze the juice from the remaining membrane of both the orange and grapefruit into the saucepan (there should be a fair amount of juice).\n\n2. Add to the saucepan the brown sugar, vanilla bean, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, star anise and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove the pan from the heat. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod into the syrup; discard the pod. Pour the syrup into a small metal pan and place it in the freezer to cool it quickly. Strain over the fruit. Discard any solids in the strainer.\n\n3. Add the pomegranate seeds and toss to blend well. Cover and chill before serving, about 1 hour.\n\nRoasted Pear and Pumpkin Soup\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\n4 cups peeled, cubed pumpkin\n\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n2 medium pears, unpeeled, cored and cubed\n\n1 medium onion, cut into large chunks\n\n2 cloves garlic, peeled\n\n2 pinches red pepper flakes\n\n6 to 8 cups hot low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth\n\n1 cup full-fat sour cream\n\nRoasted, salted pepitas, for serving\n\n1. Position a rack to the center of the oven and preheat it to 375\u00b0F.\n\n2. Place the pumpkin on a large rimmed sheet pan. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat. Roast for about 25 minutes. Stir well, and add the pears, onion, and garlic. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and season again with salt, pepper, and red pepper flake. Continue to roast for about 20-25 minutes more, stirring once or twice, until all the vegetables and fruit are golden and tender. Let cool slightly. Working in batches, blend the roasted mixture with hot stock to achieve your desired consistency. Season as needed.\n\n3. Serve topped with dollops of sour cream and roasted, salted pepitas.\n\nCreamy cucumber salad\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n\nFor the quick pickled onions:\n\n1/4 cup water\n\n1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n\n2 teaspoons granulated sugar\n\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1 small red onion, thinly sliced\n\nFor the salad:\n\n1/2 cup Greek yogurt\n\n1/4 cup mayonnaise\n\n2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar\n\n2 teaspoons lemon juice\n\n1 teaspoon honey\n\n1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n\n1 small clove garlic, grated\n\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or parsley\n\n2 large English cucumbers, thinly sliced\n\n\n\n1.
