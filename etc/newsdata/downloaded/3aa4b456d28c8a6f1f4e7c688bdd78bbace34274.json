Poetsch was chief financial officer at the time and became chairman of the supervisory board in late 2015. Diess arrived at the company shortly before the scandal broke and was initially the head of its core Volkswagen brand.\n\nWinterkorn was succeeded as CEO by Matthias Mueller, who was then replaced by Diess in April 2018.\n\nIts shares VOW3, -2.33% dropped 2.4% on the news.\n\nVolkswagen is rejecting as \u201cgroundless\u201d the market manipulation charges filed against its current and former leadership by German prosecutors.\n\nHiltrud Dorothea Werner, the board member responsible for integrity and legal affairs, said Tuesday that Volkswagen had \u201cmeticulously investigated\u201d the matter with the help of internal and external legal experts over nearly four years.\n\nShe said in a statement that \u201cthe result is clear: the allegations are groundless.\u201d Werner added that, if the indictment goes to trial, the company is \u201cconfident that the allegations will prove to be unfounded.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s supervisory board said it had already considered the possibility of charges, and that the board\u2019s executive committee \u201cwill convene a meeting immediately to discuss next steps\u201d\n\nThe charges raise the prospect that Diess would have to spend significant time on his defense at a point while the company is facing a challenging transition toward producing more electric autos and providing services such as carsharing through smartphone apps.\n\nIt is not unprecedented for a German CEO to continue while fending off charges. Deutsche Bank DB, -0.51% CEO Josef Ackermann was required to spend two days a week defending himself against charges of breach of trust in connection with his duties as a board member of mobile phone concern Mannesmann. Ackermann, who is no longer CEO, was found not guilty in 2004.\n\nVolkswagen admitted installing software in its diesel cars that turned on pollution controls when vehicles were being tested and switched them off during everyday driving. That made it look as if the cars met tough U.S. limits on harmful pollutants known as nitrogen oxides.\n\nIn all, some 11 million cars worldwide were equipped with the illegal software.\n\nThe diesel scandal has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, recall costs and civil settlements.\n\nThe automaker apologized and pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States, where two executives were sentenced to prison and six others charged, although they could not be extradited.\n\nIn a separate case, prosecutors in April charged Winterkorn and four others with fraud in the emissions cheating scandal, which has helped turn many Europeans against diesel engines and accelerated the push toward electric cars.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Winterkorn knew about the scheme since at least May 2014 and failed to put a stop to it. That contradicted his claim that he didn\u2019t learn about it until shortly before U.S. investigators announced it in September 2015.", "description": "German prosecutors say they have charged Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess and chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, along with former CEO Martin Winterkorn, with market...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR916_vw_car_ZG_20190924062447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
