Every candidate promised to pass the Equality Act, a bill that would amend the Civil Rights Act to \u201cprohibit discrimination on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity...or sex-based stereotypes,\u201d and reverse certain acts of the Donald Trump administration, like its \u201cban\u201d on transgender troops in the military.\n\nWith policy dispensed with, all that was left was for the presidential hopefuls to out-woke each other over four occasionally entertaining hours. Kamala Harris got whoops and cheers for introducing herself along with her preferred pronouns (she/her/hers, for those wondering), Julian Castro nodded along to a transgender activist calling herself \u2018Shea Diamond\u2019 declaring \u201cmisgendering\u201d as an act of \u201cviolence,\u201d and another trans activist called \u2018Blossom\u2019 interrupted a question from a child to accuse CNN of ignoring the plight of \u201cblack trans women.\u201d\n\nIt is apparently\u2014and bear with me here\u2014violence to misgender or alter the name of a (and this is key, because it\u2019s a special privilege afforded to no other group) trans person. pic.twitter.com/BnGH97bNFI \u2014 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) October 11, 2019\n\nWatch the moment a black trans-woman, \"Blossom,\" snatches the mic from a mom and her young trans child to accuse CNN of silencing trans people of color.\n\n\n\nNo matter how hard you try, you can never be woke enough, CNN.pic.twitter.com/rbtIOzYiuj \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) October 11, 2019\n\nThe inclusion of two nine-year-old transgender children - egged on by their activist parents - rankled conservatives. The kids pressed Beto O\u2019Rourke and Elizabeth Warren on what they would do if elected to clamp down on bullying in schools. But according to the right, the children shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place.\n\n\u201cThis mother is abusing her daughter, and Elizabeth Warren & CNN are applauding it,\u201d one commentator wrote.\n\nHey! Hi. This mother is abusing her daughter, and Elizabeth Warren & CNN are applauding it. https://t.co/X9FjAGYbTz \u2014 Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) October 11, 2019\n\n\"Hi, my name is Jacob, and I'm a 9-year-old transgender American...\"\n\n\n\nThe CNN producers who chose to exploit this child on national television are some truly sick monsters. #EqualityTownHall \u2014 Michael Knowles (@michaeljknowles) October 11, 2019\n\nHowever, far more insidious, no matter what your political persuasion, was the sheer totalitarian zeal on display. When candidates were asked what they would do to tackle states lagging behind on implementing the progressive agenda - referring to those 26 states that still prohibit blood transfusions from gay men and allow business to refuse service based on religious beliefs - the answer was uniform: crush them with federal legislation.\n\nWarren promised to abolish the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule - the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation - to overcome Republican resistance to the Equality Act. The act itself may be beningly named, but by adding a person\u2019s \u201cgender identity\u201d to the list of protected classes under Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act it would force schools to open bathrooms to transgender students, override a parent\u2019s decision not to allow their child to seek gender reassignment, and forbid threapists and doctors from cautioning these children against such procedures.\n\nPut simply, the bill would equate those opposing gender transitions for children with the racists of the Jim Crow era.\n\nAlso on rt.com Joy of self-identification or social contagion? Why did trans become the trend\n\nBusinesses who refuse to serve LGBT customers based on their own religious beliefs - like the baker in Colorado at the center of the \u2018gay cake\u2019 controversy - would be forced to comply under pain of federal law. So too would hospitals who refuse to carry out transgender surgery, and likely even beauty parlors that refuse to wax transgender women with male genitalia. This was the case in Canada when transgender activist Jessica Yaniv got more than a dozen waxing salons shut down after their female staff refused to wax \u2018her' testicles.\n\nState-mandated sexual assault is not equality, but it would be law under the Equality Act.\n\nEven feminists have spoken out against the act, sounding the alarm at the prospect of transgender women being allowed to compete against actual women in sports, and at the idea of these biological men being housed alongside women in prisons - a policy championed by Warren.\n\nThe Equality Act would still occasionally clash with the First Amendment, which protects religious speech, and saw the aforementioned Colorado baker escape prosecution last year. Beto O\u2019Rourke has a plan for that though, and told the crowd on Thursday that he would strip the tax-exempt status of every church, college, charity and religious institution that opposes same-sex marriage. This on top of the two dozen LGBT-focused executive orders he\u2019s already promised on his campaign site.\n\nDemocrat presidential candidate Robert Francis O'Rourke says that he will take away the tax-exempt status of churches if they do not believe in same-sex marriage pic.twitter.com/CcHyiUVCAs \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 11, 2019\n\nIs any of this surprising? After all, O\u2019Rourke has already let the public know exactly what he thinks of the Constitution with his vow to confiscate every single AR-15 and AK-47 in America, so why not go after the First too?\n\nConservatives will likely ignore these warning shots, for fear of offending the LGBT lobby and being labeled backward and bigoted. They shouldn\u2019t though. What the democrats displayed on Thursday was a four-hour paean to the totalitarian state, and a complete rejection of individual liberty, all wrapped up in cuddly rainbow packaging.\n\nFor all their talk of culture wars and their equating of Democrats to the communists of Soviet Russia, conservatives have been utterly spineless in resisting the flagrant trampling of individual liberty they swear to uphold. If the Republican party fails to locate its (trigger warning) balls up to and beyond the next election, pretty soon there won\u2019t be a Bill of Rights left to conserve.\n\nBy Graham Dockery, RT.\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "As a panel of Democrats fell over each other to pander for the rainbow vote at CNN\u2019s LGBTQ town hall, conservatives raged at the inclusion of transgender children, but not at the Dems\u2019 plans to shred the Bill of Rights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da0caf72030271b1c30ce7e.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
