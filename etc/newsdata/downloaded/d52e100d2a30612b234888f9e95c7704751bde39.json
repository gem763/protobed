You cannot replicate that.\u201d\n\nJennifer Martin, executive director of Celebrate Frederick, says, \u201cThere\u2019s real vibrancy to downtown, it\u2019s unique with so many independently run or family-owned specialty shops you won\u2019t find anywhere else, plus pop-up art shows, and events. People who live downtown seem to embrace that excitement and energy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat began as a flood control project is now a vibrant urban green space. Carroll Creek\u2019s Linear Park is a 1.3-mile waterway in the middle of downtown with fountains, brick walkways, public art, pedestrian bridges, restaurants and a 350-seat-amphitheater for events such as the popular Alive @ 5 concerts produced by Downtown Frederick Partnership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an artsy, \u2018kind of hipster\u2019 place with a cool vibe,\u201d said Stacie Lynch, 24, a Frederick County resident. \u201cI go down there quite a bit. Visit the rooftop bar at Brewer\u2019s Alley . . . for the food and people watching!\u201d\n\nFounded by German settlers in 1745, Frederick is nestled among Civil War battlegrounds at Monocacy, Antietam and Gettysburg. The National Museum of Civil War Medicine on East Patrick Street pays homage to the town\u2019s care for wounded soldiers during the war.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Historic Preservation Commission safeguards the historical and cultural heritage of downtown, which is composed of predominantly original 19th-century buildings. The historic area is bounded by Seventh Street to the north, Bentz Street to the west, East Street to the east, and South Street and Shab Row to the south.\n\nLong and Foster real estate agent Ed Stanfield has been selling homes in the area since 1969.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a spectrum of types of residences with a lot of charm within a broad range of pricing,\u201d Stanfield said. \u201cA lot of folks have lived downtown for quite a while, retirees and people late in their careers, and there\u2019s been an influx of younger folks, millennials that work in technical fields and like the convenience of walking downtown to where the nighttime action is and being able to walk or bike to work.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe more expensive housing is near the center of downtown, while the less expensive housing is closer to the city\u2019s boundaries. Prices downtown run from the mid-$200,000s for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium to $1.5 million for a six-bedroom, five-bathroom restored townhouse in the heart of the historic district.\n\nLess expensive housing such as smaller homes built in 1950s to 1960s, historic townhouses and bungalows cost about $200,000 to $350,000.\n\nRents run from $1,500 to $3,000 per month.\n\nFrederick native Jack Rentschler, 27, rents a three-bedroom apartment downtown with his wife, Ashley, and their two cats. Rentschler is a financial analyst who commutes to Fort Detrick. He also is a guitarist and vocalist in a Frederick-based alt-rock band, Wvnder. The Rentschlers love the walkability of downtown, the historic buildings, the pop-up events, live music and the nearby 10th Ward Distillery.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResident Joe Williams retired from the government in 2018.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rarely bored,\u201d he said.\n\nWilliams and wife Kayte own a three-bedroom townhouse downtown. They enjoy walking, fine dining on Carroll Creek, and the vibrant arts community. Before retiring, Williams walked less than a mile to the transit center, rode a MARC train to Rockville, and then switched to the Metro for one stop.\n\n\u201cCommuting wasn\u2019t always great, but hey, you could go all the way to D.C. from Frederick and never get into a car,\u201d he said.\n\nSchools: Spring Ridge, North Frederick, Parkway and Lincoln elementary; Gov. Thomas Johnson, Crestwood and West Frederick middle; and Frederick, Gov. Thomas Johnson and Tuscarora high.\n\nTransportation: Major thoroughfares include Interstate 270 to Washington, I-70 to Baltimore, U.S. Route 340 to Harpers Ferry, W.Va., and Route 15 to Leesburg. The transit center for Greyhound buses, MARC commuter trains, local TransIT buses and shuttles is on S. East Street.\n\nAD", "description": "WHERE WE LIVE | The historic downtown abounds with restaurants, bars, music and a vibrant urban park.", "authors": ["Lisa M.
