First, the list of teams facing \u201ctitle or bust\u201d expectations is short given the league\u2019s newfound parity. Unrealistic expectations tend to drive rash decisions, so a flatter field generally makes life easier for coaches.\n\nSecond, there are a bunch of fresh faces who are still getting acclimated: Cleveland, Memphis, Phoenix and Sacramento all made new hires this offseason, Chicago and Minnesota upgraded interim coaches to full-time deals, and teams such as Atlanta, New York, Orlando and Charlotte all remain in the honeymoon period with their 2018 hires.\n\nFinally, there is a growing list of coaches who seem more or less untouchable: Old standbys like Gregg Popovich, Rick Carlisle, Steve Kerr and Erik Spoelstra have found new company with the likes of Doc Rivers, Nick Nurse, Quin Snyder and Mike Budenholzer. How likely is it, really, for one of those coaches to be replaced by a superior alternative over the next 12 months? Not very likely.\n\nNot every coach is safe, of course. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of five who might find themselves feeling the heat in 2019-20.\n\nFrank Vogel, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nVogel deserves a fair shot, but there\u2019s no reason to pretend he will be given an appropriate amount of time and space to execute his vision. The Lakers represent the most pressure-packed job in the NBA: LeBron James\u2019s clock is ticking, the front office mortgaged the future to trade for Anthony Davis and seven full seasons have passed since they have won a playoff series.\n\nTo make matters worse, Vogel, who was hired in May, arrives in difficult circumstances. He wasn\u2019t the franchise\u2019s first choice during a convoluted coaching search, former head coach Jason Kidd was placed on his bench and Vogel will be the Lakers\u2019 sixth coach since Phil Jackson retired in 2011. He also must brace for constant comparisons to the crosstown Clippers, who look like a potential juggernaut.\n\nBut, wait, there\u2019s more. Vogel has no prior ties to James, Davis or the Lakers organization, and a majority of his projected rotation is composed of newcomers. Good luck.\n\nMike D\u2019Antoni, Houston Rockets\n\nThings could be worse for the affable D\u2019Antoni, who gets to build his offense around an MVP-caliber workhorse in James Harden and numerous veterans with continuity. Even so, this summer looks like a slap in the face to the longtime coach, who reportedly engaged and reengaged in contract extension negotiations without reaching an agreement. The latest: Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey told the Houston Chronicle last week that the discussions have been tabled until after the 2019-20 season, making D\u2019Antoni a lame duck as his organization seeks to finally get over the hump in the playoffs.\n\nThat pressure cooker is complicated by a few other variables, most notably the addition of Russell Westbrook. D\u2019Antoni has the unenviable task of trying to strike the right balance between Harden and Westbrook, two of the highest-usage players of the modern era. What\u2019s more, he will need to do so without any financial security of his own while Harden, Westbrook, Eric Gordon and Clint Capela all possess lucrative long-term contracts.\n\nIf anything goes wrong \u2014 Harden gets hurt, Westbrook doesn\u2019t fit, mercurial owner Tilman Fertitta\u2019s impatience boils over, the Rockets draw a tough playoff matchup \u2014 D\u2019Antoni will be sitting there with \u201cscapegoat\u201d flashing in neon lights on his forehead.\n\nBrett Brown, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nWorking in Brown\u2019s favor: he received a public vote of confidence from managing partner Josh Harris in May, and he is reportedly owed $15 million over the remaining three years of his current contract.\n\nWorking against Brown: his job status was a topic of conversation throughout the 2019 playoffs, his ownership group spent the summer heavily investing in its roster, and he will be expected to guide the Sixers, at minimum, to their first Eastern Conference finals since 2001.\n\nThis is shaping up to be a \u201cno excuses\u201d season for the Sixers. With LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard in the West and Kevin Durant injured, the door is wide open for Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and veteran additions including Al Horford and Josh Richardson. There is zero margin for Brown to underachieve, and anything short of a hard-fought loss to Milwaukee in the East finals should be viewed as a grave disappointment.\n\nBilly Donovan, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nA lot has changed in Oklahoma City since GM Sam Presti picked up Donovan\u2019s 2019-20 option last December. Russell Westbrook? Gone. Paul George? Gone. Title contention expectations? Poof. Playoff hopes? Probably poof too.\n\nStill, Donovan has some talent to work with, namely Chris Paul, Danilo Gallinari and Steven Adams. He\u2019s also built goodwill with the Thunder\u2019s front office during his four seasons at the helm, remaining a good soldier despite frequent roster turnover and the departures of major stars.\n\nThis is a tricky situation to gauge from the outside. Donovan doesn\u2019t face any real pressure to win given the summer's fireworks, but the opportunity to coach a contender is what drew him to the NBA from the college ranks in the first place. If Oklahoma City decides to plunge deeper into a rebuild, will Presti and/or Donovan conclude that their partnership has run its course?\n\nScott Brooks, Washington Wizards\n\nWashington undertook a long-awaited front office makeover this summer, installing Tommy Sheppard in place of the fired Ernie Grunfeld. Brooks, who has two years and $14 million remaining on his contract, survived the transition but can hardly be feeling secure.\n\nEverything should be on the table for the Wizards over the next 12 months, including a Bradley Beal trade, a deep and purposeful rebuild and, yes, a coaching change. Brooks will have his hands full this season, needing to prove that he can show progress on the chemistry and culture fronts while trying to squeeze a competitive team from a roster that lacks many proven players outside Beal.\n\nShould the Wizards struggle through another dismal campaign, it\u2019s easy to envision the higher-ups deciding to search for a new voice.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump teases that he\u2019d like to visit India to watch an NBA game next month\n\nAfter free agency free-for-all, NBA implements stiffer tampering rules\n\nDoc Rivers talks Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and how the Clippers pulled off deal of the decade\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity\n\nSign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get the best basketball coverage in your inbox", "description": "The NBA season hasn't started, but already there should be some uncertainty in Houston, Los Angeles and Washington.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter", "September At Am", "Ben Golliver Joined The Washington Post As The National Nba Writer In Previously", "He Was A Senior Writer At Sports Illustrated Covering The Nba.
