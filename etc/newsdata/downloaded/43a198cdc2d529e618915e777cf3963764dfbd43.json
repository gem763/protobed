Prosecutors subsequently hit Gooding with two misdemeanor counts in this alleged incident: forcible touching and sexual abuse in the third degree. He had pleaded not guilty to these initial charges.\n\nDetails about the indictment are minimal, with prosecutor Jenna Long saying in court, \u201cThe defendant has been indicted on the charges in this docket, as well as an additional incident previously uncharged.\u201d\n\nNews of the indictment came as a shock. While Gooding was scheduled to appear in court, the newsworthiness of his appearance was initially unclear. It was possible his case would have gone to trial, but it was also possible that it would have been put off again. An additional indictment was unexpected.\n\nGooding entered the courtroom just shy of 10:10 a.m., looking as he had at prior appearances: worse for wear. Gooding is due back in court on October 15 for his arraignment.", "description": "The groping case against Cuba Gooding Jr. has just gotten more serious, with Manhattan prosecutors revealing in court this morning he was indicted on Wednesday \u2014 and that the allegations now included an \u201cadditional incident.\u201d", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/10/10-cuba-gooding-jr.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
