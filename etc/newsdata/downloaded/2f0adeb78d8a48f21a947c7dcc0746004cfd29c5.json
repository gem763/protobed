On a high-profile visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave no indication of pressing for further cuts in output from the so-called OPEC+ group \u2013 the loose alliance informally led by Russia and the desert kingdom.\n\nSaudi Arabian oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, meanwhile, said that he expected Saudi Arabia to maintain output at 9.86 million barrels a day throughout October and November, having fully restored the country\u2019s oil infrastructure in the wake of a series of drone strikes a month ago.\n\nThe attacks, which knocked out over 5% of the world\u2019s oil supply for a few days, caused only the briefest of spikes, prompting some bewilderment at the lack of a visible geopolitical risk premium. However, some think the risk premium is there alright \u2013 it\u2019s just masking exceptionally weak fundamentals.\n\nAbhi Rajendran, head of North American shale research at Energy Intelligence, said via Twitter there is probably a $5/barrel premium still built in to market prices.\n\nNormally, lower oil prices should feed through to consumers in oil importers, supporting the economy. However, other developments in global oil markets may be stopping that from happening. Analysts at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies argued in a research note published Monday that U.S. sanctions on Chinese shipping COSCO and Exxon (NYSE: ) and Unipec\u2019s parallel actions against ships connected to Venezuela have significantly reduced the effective availability of tankers to the global market. That results in more expensive arbitrage opportunities for buyers.\n\n\u201cIn just over a week, the cost of taking a barrel of oil on that route (from the Gulf to Asia), through the cheapest possible way, rose by $6 per barrel,\u201d authors Adi Imsirovic and Michal Meidan wrote.\n\nHopes that lower prices would knock out some marginal shale producers still seem wide of the mark: the U.S. is producing at record levels and the long decline in U.S. drilling came to at least a temporary halt last week, with Baker Hughes reporting the first weekly increase in active oil drilling rigs since August.\n\nThe worsening fundamentals have also caused a major rethink by hedge funds and other portfolio players in the last week. According to CFTC data released on Friday, speculative net long positions in fell to their lowest in four months.", "description": "Oil Prices Tumble as Market Reassesses Fragile U.S.-China Truce", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB4B06M_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
