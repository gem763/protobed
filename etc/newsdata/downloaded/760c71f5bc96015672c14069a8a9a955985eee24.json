Paul Rudd\u2019s character nervously agreed and replies, \u201cYou?\u201d\n\nBrady responds \u201csix\u201d.\n\nIt appears to be referring to Brady\u2019s six NFL titles.\n\nOr it would have been had the owner of Brady\u2019s New England Patriots Robert Kraft not been caught on camera and charged in a prostitution sting at a massage parlour in January.\n\nThe New York Post reported at the time that the 77-year-old billionaire allegedly spent 11 minutes with a masseuse who greeted him with a hug, fondled him \u201cand then put her head down by\u201d his crotch the morning of January 20 \u2014 the same day as the AFC Championship game against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIt then became a tourist attraction for NFL fans who hate the Patriots.\n\nBrady was furious when asked about the cameo in the show, especially when it was written four years earlier and he had agreed to do the cameo a year ago.\n\nTom Brady answers questions about his cameo on a Netflix show and he wasn\u2019t happy. pic.twitter.com/WpI7mrfGJy \u2014 Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) October 19, 2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what it was about, I think that was taken out of context,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt was meant to be something different than that. The fact that it\u2019s a distraction and you\u2019re bringing it up is not something I want to be talking about.\u201d\n\nThe US media were all over the story, with US Today saying it spoofed Kraft and Brady took aim at the \u201cblame and shame\u201d culture of the media.\n\nBrady said it was shot on a green screen and he said it was wasn\u2019t about Kraft\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that people would choose to think that I would ever do something like that about Mr. Kraft,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very bad assessment of my relationship with him. I would never do that.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows what our relationship is about. For 20 years, it\u2019s nothing but love and respect. I\u2019ve been through a lot of tough things with him and I love him dearly. I sympathise with a lot of things he\u2019s gone through in his life.\u201d\n\nSocial media was quick to laugh at the cameo but Brady had plenty of defenders, with some claiming producers \u201cdid Brady dirty\u201d.\n\nHas been explained to me that the green screen was indeed used in that parking lot. Seems like the creators of this show did Brady dirty. And got what they wanted: tons of publicity. https://t.co/pJGvvHeKxg \u2014 Michael Giardi (@MikeGiardi) October 19, 2019\n\nWatched \u201cLiving With Yourself\u201d ... the Brady joke fit in with the script and was really funny. They didn\u2019t create a spa to make a Kraft joke. Was central part of the whole plot. If Brady wasn\u2019t in front of the spa it wouldn\u2019t have made sense. https://t.co/htvS2V71Nj \u2014 Andrew Perloff (@andrewperloff) October 20, 2019\n\nTom Brady got totally porked by the Netflix people. Totally unfair to him and Robert Kraft. https://t.co/fM614A2lKc \u2014 Jared Stillman (@JaredStillman) October 19, 2019\n\nBrady is the \ud83d\udc10. His scene was hilarious. I totally get it was written well before any Kraft stuff. But how he could blame the media or think people associating a massage parlor storefront scene with current events with his owner is silly. https://t.co/RgWy4DGDpv \u2014 Will Manso (@WillManso) October 19, 2019\n\nEarlier this week, series director Timothy Greenberg said in an interview with Refinery29 that the scene wasn\u2019t filmed until the Patriots season ended, which it did on the back of another Super Bowl win.\n\nIt also means that Kraft\u2019s incident had already been in the news and Greenberg admitted he thought Brady would pull out of the shoot because the parlour Kraft was caught at \u201clooked almost exactly like what we were shooting.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, I would have used it as a reference photo,\u201d Greenberg said of the massage parlour from Kraft\u2019s story. \u201cSo we\u2019re like, \u2018Alright, this is clearly not going to happen now\u2019.\u201d", "description": "A blink-and-you\u2019d-miss-it cameo from Tom Brady in new Netflix show Living with Yourself has dragged the NFL superstar into a uncomfortable position.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/983e004fb96f7102187e15de8faffb5b?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
