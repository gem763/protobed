It said such delays end up costing lives.\n\nThe study pointed to \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence that people would be more likely to accept invitations for screening if appointments were available at convenient times and locations \u2013 either near home or their place of work.\n\nSome women also prefer to be screened at sexual health clinics, while GPs must be \u201cincentivised\u201d to provide convenient appointments and ensure people take up screening, it said.\n\nText message reminders could also be sent to increase uptake of appointments, although current IT systems hinder access to mobile phone numbers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

However, their gender may be recorded as male and thus they would not be routinely called for cervical screening. Transwomen are at an increased risk of breast cancer compared to cisgender men if using hormones, but are only invited for screening if registered as female.\u201d\n\nThe report welcomed the government\u2019s new funding to replace MRI machines, CT scanners and breast screening equipment, saying some equipment was hugely outdated, with some mobile vans for breast screening \u201cat least 17 years old\u201d and had \u201cleaking roofs\u201d.\n\nAnd while most patients get the results of their screening on time, just 23.2 per cent of women received their cervical screening results within the recommended two weeks in April 2019 due to a changeover to a new system.\n\nThe report said the current screening service saves over 10,000 lives a year but there is a sense \u201cthat we are now slipping\u201d and each screening service could \u201cdo better\u201d.\n\nIt was also unclear who is accountable for the screening service \u2013 with Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England both having key roles \u2013 and the report said responsibility must be transferred to NHS England.\n\n\u201cThe current system lacks clear leadership and accountability,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe rationale for dividing responsibilities across PHE and NHSE is often unclear and creates confusion, delays and risks to patient safety.\u201d\n\nOn IT, the study said the current systems used for screening \u201care woefully out of date and long due for replacement\u201d, leading \u201cto inefficiencies and errors\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cSome of the systems \u2013 particularly those for breast and cervical screening \u2013 are old and liable to fail.\u201d\n\nSir Mike welcomed the work being done by bodies including NHSX to upgrade the systems, adding that this process must continue.\n\nThe report said: \u201cA modern IT system should enable patients to make or change their own appointments for screening, to be able to access information on their own screening records and to see when their various screenings are next due. None of these functions are currently available.\u201d\n\nSimon Stevens, NHS chief executive, welcomed the report and said the recommendations were \u201csensible\u201d, while Health Secretary Matt Hancock accepted that NHS England would take on overall responsibility for screening.\n\nSara Hiom, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of early diagnosis, said: \u201cThousands of premature deaths are avoided every year in the UK thanks to our cancer screening programmes, but there are still many things holding them back.\u201d\n\nShe said a \u201clack of funding has led to an archaic NHS infrastructure \u2013 especially IT systems \u2013 making it virtually impossible to optimise our country\u2019s screening programmes.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe Department of Health and Social Care must take urgent action to ensure the review\u2019s recommendations are implemented so that no lives are needlessly lost to cancer.\u201d\n\nRobert Music, chief executive of Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust, said there needed to be \u201cquick and decisive action as a result of the recommendations\u201d.", "description": "Patients must have greater availability of cancer screening services in order to halt a \u201cworrying decline\u201d in the number of people attending, a government-ordered review has said.
