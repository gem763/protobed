Investor sentiment towards the single currency has been hurt by a broad economic slowdown in Europe driven by the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\nOn Thursday, the German government said it lowered its 2020 forecast for economic growth to 1.0% from 1.5% previously, but added that Europe's largest economy was not facing a crisis.\n\nNews of the deal sent sterling surging to a five-month high and within a whisker of $1.30 before retreating sharply as traders worried that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson might fail to get lawmakers to support the Brexit plan, plunging the country into another round of uncertainty.\n\nSterling was 0.18% lower at $1.2807.\n\nThe dollar has come under pressure this week, shedding about 0.6% against a basket of currencies.\n\nThe greenback, which fell on Wednesday after weak U.S. retail sales data supported the case for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, extended its weakness on Thursday.\n\nData showed U.S. homebuilding tumbled from a more than a 12-year high in September. Separately, data showed a deceleration in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in October.\n\nThe Norwegian crown weakened to an all-time low of 10.1800 against the euro. Some analysts blamed the crown's recent weakness on global trade jitters, while others said the speed and magnitude of the drop were hard to explain.\n\nThe Australian dollar held near the day's highs, up 1.04% against the dollar after jobs data showed buoyant hiring, lowering chances of monetary easing in November.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "description": "The U.S. dollar fell against the euro on Thursday as the common currency got a lift from the European Union and Britain striking a long-awaited Brexit deal.
