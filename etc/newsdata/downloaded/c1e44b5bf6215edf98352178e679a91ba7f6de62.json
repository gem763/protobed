It is now an abusive platform,\u201d Mboweni tweeted.\n\nAfter a long thought process, I have decided not to do any original tweets anymore. I might, just might, retweet (not endorsement). I came to the conclusion that Twitter is no longer about its original purpose: ie to create a networked society. It is now an abusive platform. \u2014 Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) October 29, 2019\n\nFor many years, Mboweni has been active and controversial on the social media platform, earning him the moniker \u201cTweeto\u201d in some quarters.\n\nEarlier this year, he picked a public fight with Gauteng Premier David Makhura after tweeting that users of e-tolls must pay. \"I don\u2019t know why the middle and upper classes in Gauteng want to complicate our lives. The working class do not pay e-tolls!! Public transport! Hello\u2026\"\n\nMakhura, who supported the abolishment of etolls, in turn tweeted that he referred the matter to President Cyril Ramaphosa for \"final resolution\". He added that Mboweni was just a minister, and not president.\n\nMboweni tweeted that Makhura should not \"pick a fight\" with the finance minister who is in charge of provincial allocation.\n\nMboweni also stirred up controversy by comparing, unfavourably, the state of downtown Johannesburg with Kigali.\n\nYesterday, December 26, 2018, I decided to drive around the Johannesburg CBD. It was filthy and embarrassing. I came across these shacks in the middle of our city. This morning I arrived to a clean and beautiful city of Kigali, Rwanda. What a contrast! pic.twitter.com/VGewkVntba \u2014 Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) December 27, 2018\n\nWhile his Twitter stream wasn\u2019t short of polemical views, many of his followers were there only for the food:\n\nOn your marks, get set, I am ready for Lucky Star dinner. Dinner time!! pic.twitter.com/Lz1AgAfn39 \u2014 Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) March 6, 2018\n\nSo, dinner this evening includes this. It is called Majenje, not termites as my London educated friend says, frowning upon my delicacy! Naas.. They can bite your tongue though. So you chew them strategically and tactically!! pic.twitter.com/tl70aZIHJj \u2014 Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) March 7, 2018\n\nBe careful of East African chillies at official functions! Too hot and you will sweat badly!! Not good for you.... But tasty... pic.twitter.com/qagwLQcCZk \u2014 Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) March 21, 2018\n\nIn September, Mboweni announced that he would take a Twitter break until December.\n\nRock the boat! Shake the baobab tree! Do the unusual, disrupt the comfortable zones. Get things moving. Irritate the Establishment! Let them think! That is how you get Movement forward. This country needs Movement! Disrupt, destruct inertia! \u2014 Tito Mboweni (@tito_mboweni) September 10, 2019\n\nBut on Wednesday, it became clear that this would become more permanent.\n\nSome of his followers, including journalist and broadcaster Redi Tlhabi, urged him to remain on the social media platform:\n\nDon't! Otherwise abusive ones win. Stay & engage with the people who don't wake up in the morning with the sole purpose of insulting you, twisting your words..Toughen up. Keep going. Twitter IS that, but also a gathering of smart people. Find them & ignore the background noise https://t.co/YD4G3QPoWs \u2014 Redi Tlhabi (@RediTlhabi) October 30, 2019\n\nFor now, Mboweni has larger concerns than the mean streets of South African Twitter: After an unenthusiastic response to government\u2019s rescue plan for Eskom on Tuesday, the focus will be on his medium-term budget speech on Wednesday afternoon which should include more definite details on how government will deal with the power utility's R450bn debt burden.\n\nTime is running out as Moody\u2019s, the only ratings agency that hasn\u2019t \u201cjunked\u201d South Africa yet, will announce its new rating on Friday.\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "It all happened in the early morning hours on the day he has to present what may be the most important medium-term budget in SA\u2019s history.", "authors": ["Minutes Ago"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8787/99f0a2eccd9649f4a2b610bb814c67c0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
