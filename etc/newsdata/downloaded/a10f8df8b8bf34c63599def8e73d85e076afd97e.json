For three games, quarterback Dak Prescott looked like a leading league MVP candidate and the Cowboys seemed to be justifying the big-money contract extensions handed out by owner Jerry Jones to running back Ezekiel Elliott and other players. Only a few weeks later, the situation is relatively dire, and the Cowboys are coming off a particularly embarrassing defeat to the previously winless New York Jets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThings have gotten bad enough that it is being debated whether Jones would fire Jason Garrett as his coach if the Cowboys lose to the Eagles. It probably wouldn\u2019t happen, given that Jones has dismissed only one head coach \u2014 Wade Phillips \u2014 during a season. But the fact that is has become a topic of public conversation is telling. Former Ohio State coach Urban Meyer added to the intrigue when he said in a radio interview that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would be interested if the Cowboys were to come calling after the season.\n\nEagles at Cowboys\n\nWhen: Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex.\n\nTV: NBC\n\nStreaming: fuboTV\n\nThe Cowboys at least are getting healthier. Offensive tackles Tyron Smith and La\u2019el Collins returned to practice last week and could be back in the lineup. Wide receivers Amari Cooper and Randall Cobb were listed as questionable on the team\u2019s injury report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat puts the Cowboys in better shape than the Eagles. Quarterback Carson Wentz again will have to do without the big-play capabilities of wide receiver DeSean Jackson. He is to remain sidelined because of an abdominal injury. Rookie Andre Dillard, a first-round draft choice out of Washington State, is to start at left tackle in place of the injured Jason Peters. The Eagles also are to be without running back Darren Sproles, defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan, linebacker Nigel Bradham and cornerback Avonte Maddox.\n\nThe Eagles are coming off to a loss to the Minnesota Vikings in which the Philadelphia defense could not stop quarterback Kirk Cousins and wide receiver Stefon Diggs. So the Eagles will have to be particularly mindful of the Prescott-to-Cooper combination, if Cooper indeed plays.\n\nThe buildup to the game last week included Eagles Coach Doug Pederson saying on a Philadelphia radio station that the Eagles would win, then denying that he\u2019d made a victory guarantee. That led Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence to advise Pederson to keep quiet and \u201cstay on the sideline.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys swept the Eagles last season and have won the teams\u2019 last three meetings. What once looked to be a big game in the race for NFC supremacy has been reduced to being a game in which one team will have to be satisfied with creeping above .500 and stopping things from getting any worse.\n\nAD", "description": "The two would-be heavyweights in the NFC East enter the game with matching 3-3 records.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NEFbTEJx5aqvFbeaBF5oSum7qdU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KS35OQHOEAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
