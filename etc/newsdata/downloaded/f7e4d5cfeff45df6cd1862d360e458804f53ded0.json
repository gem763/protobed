We wanted a coalition government that would be concerned with service delivery and that would be pro-poor, that was the foundation,\u201d Masina said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe then said that as part and parcel of our contribution to the relationship, there is something called section 79 committees, which is the equivalent of a portfolio committee chairperson in Parliament, so you do oversight. So we offered them portfolios of community services, land, police and city planning. That was the extent of our agreement regarding leadership. We kept the executive purely ANC so that there would be no ideological confusions, but also so that you don\u2019t have another party seeking to enforce its view.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to Mashaba, he said they implemented another party\u2019s policy. We have not had to do that, we have stuck to our own.\u201d\n\nMasina insisted that the ANC had \u201cavoided a relationship of convenience and deals\u201d, with the four smaller parties.\n\nDuring the negotiations which followed the elections, the AIC demanded that the ANC guarantee the return of Matatiele to KwaZulu-Natal from the Eastern Cape.\n\nThe demarcations of that town had been changed in 2005, a move which saw a series of protests.\n\nThe mayor last week said that while there was agreement in principle that the ANC would look into the matter, it was not a deal-breaker.\n\n\u201cWe can go to the next elections without it being resolved and other elections again. You don\u2019t wake up and change boundaries. There are a lot of considerations because it goes with a lot of complex issues because it involves two provinces Mzwandile Masina\n\n\u201cMatatiele is not a deal, it is a principle. The AIC raised an issue and we took it where it belongs and that it is with the ANC\u2019s national executive committee, which is dealing with it.\n\n\u201cWe can go to the next elections without it being resolved and other elections again. You don\u2019t wake up and change boundaries. There are a lot of considerations because it goes with a lot of complex issues because it involves two provinces. But what we know between ourselves and the AIC is that there are legitimate processes in place. As to when it will happen, I don\u2019t think it should be an issue of preoccupation.\u201d\n\nAmid ongoing allegations of corruption in the city, Masina says he has repeatedly been vindicated by the Auditor-General and other institutions of government, which he says have indicated that there is something fundamentally right being done in Ekurhuleni.\n\n\u201cWhen people don\u2019t get their way they will say the mayor is corrupt, that he has a girlfriend, that he has stolen this or that, or that you are an evil person.\n\n\u201cBut where it matters is with the Auditor-General, who comes every year and looks at everything we do here. That is how I measure myself and how I console my family.\u201d\n\nMasina has survived a series of battles to unseat him as chairperson of the Ekurhuleni region.\n\nHe is also constantly in hot water for his views on Twitter, but says being critical of the ANC is necessary for its survival.\n\n\u201cI am the only person who has served two terms as a chairman in this region since 1994, that should tell you something. Leading to when we were going to Nasrec and when we were coming back, people were saying \u201che is gone\u201d. They came back and I clobbered them because people know the truth. I represent the voiceless and that is why I will always be strong here in the province and in the country.\n\n\u201cPeople need someone who is independent. I am not captured by anybody, that has been my character. I love my ANC, I love the leadership that is elected, all of them, but they are not God, so they must answer.\n\n\u201cThat is what leadership is about and that is why I can tolerate things and answer anything thrown at me. Leadership must answer. So when we say that you said the Reserve Bank must be nationalised, it is not me, it is a resolution of conference, it is the ANC. Free education, [land expropriation without compensation], among other issues resolved on, somebody must ask those things.\u201d", "description": "Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina says the coalition running the industrial heartland in the east of Gauteng has outlived others formed in 2016 because it is based on principles, not \u201cconvenience or deals\u201d.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/47abfb36417e4ad191e281f96c76f962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
