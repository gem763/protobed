All of us must generate the culture of paying for services rendered,\" he stressed.\n\nMboweni turned his attention to Soweto, which owes Eskom billions.\n\n\"There is a famous township in Gauteng which owes Eskom R18bn,\" he said. He did not elaborate.\n\nOnce you have listened, share the podcast and your thoughts on our social media platforms.\n\nPOLOTIKI is a News24 weekly politics podcast.", "description": "Is this the beginning of the end for DA leader Mmusi Maimane or will he emerge a stronger political player?
