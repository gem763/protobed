As if the police don\u2019t have enough on their plates as it is, when they show up at the scene of a disturbance and find themselves confronting a mentally ill person things can quickly spiral out of control. In the Big Apple, Mayor Bill de Blasio has had enough of this issue and he\u2019s going to do something about it. From now on, the cops will be ordered to stop referring to the mentally ill as \u201cEDPs\u201d (\u201cemotionally disturbed persons\u201d). In the future, all such incidents will be referred to as \u201cmental health calls.\u201d That should fix everything, right? (NY Post)\n\nNYPD cops will have to stop referring to dangerously unhinged people as \u201cEDPs\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cemotionally disturbed persons\u201d \u2014 as part of a $37 million program to deal with serious mental-health emergencies, according to a new report on Monday. The long-established lingo will be abandoned in favor of \u201cmental health calls,\u201d sources told The City website, which described the change in terminology as one of the \u201ckey elements\u201d of a plan by Mayor Bill de Blasio to reform how cops deal with mentally ill people. \u201cOne in five New Yorkers suffers from a mental health condition. It\u2019s our job to reach those people before crisis strikes,\u201d de Blasio said in a statement announcing the new spending.\n\nOn top of the change in language, NYPD officers responding to reports of a \u201cmental health call\u201d will be joined by a mental-health worker from the newly formed Behavioral Health Unit.\u201d\n\nThe cops are already up in arms over this plan and for good reason. First of all, what difference is it going to make in terms of the actual suspect/patient if the police describe them differently over the dispatch radio? It\u2019s not as if they\u2019re showing up on the scene and yelling \u201cEDP!\u201d at them. Nor does the new terminology make the situation any less dangerous either for the suspect or the responding officers.\n\nOne cop was quoted as saying, \u201cWhat the f\u2013k difference does it make what we call them? It\u2019s the same thing. Enough with the Kumbaya. How about taking care of the main problem, which is a lack of mental-health care?\u201d\n\nThat part of the new plan is literally just a matter of semantics, so perhaps it won\u2019t cause too many problems. But the idea of dispatching a mental-health worker to an active crime scene is really worrying (and angering) the NYPD. You can probably guess why.\n\nThe need for better care for the mentally ill is obvious and if the city plans to do something constructive about that we should applaud them. But nobody is calling 911 because they see someone who looks depressed or is talking to their imaginary friend. By the time the dispatcher gets the call, there\u2019s already a crisis in progress and the person in question is probably in the midst of attacking someone or threatening to do so.\n\nThat\u2019s the type of scene that the mayor proposes sending a mental-health expert with no law enforcement training into. The cops already have a violent lunatic on their hands, but now they also have to make sure that the Behavioral Health Unit worker doesn\u2019t get themselves shot or stabbed in the process. As one officer put it, \u201cGod forbid you\u2019re a cop and you allow one of these civilians to get hurt.\u201d Another said, \u201csome innocent person is going to die real soon with this program.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what all of these proposals are going to cost the taxpayers of Gotham, but couldn\u2019t that money be put to better use in developing new mental health care facilities and paying for doctors to treat people before we reach the point where they\u2019re swinging a samurai sword in Times Square? It\u2019s another bang-up job by City Hall in the Big Apple. Hizzoner is once again finding unique ways to throw money at a problem without addressing the underlying issue.", "description": "That should fix everything", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/de-Blasio-rats.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
