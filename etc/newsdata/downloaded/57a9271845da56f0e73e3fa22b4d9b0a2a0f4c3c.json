Google recommends booting in recovery mode and entering the following terminal command to fix the issue: chroot /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD # \"Macintosh HD\" is the default rm -rf /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle mv var var_back # var may not exist, but this is fine ln -sh private/var var chflags -h restricted /var chflags -h hidden /var xattr -sw com.apple.rootless \"\" /var\n\nMass shut downs of Mac computers were first reported by Variety and were initially thought to be caused by a computer virus or an issue with Avid's movie-editing software - an industry standard among post-production companies.\n\nOnce the computers spontaneously shut down, users were reportedly not able to reboot the machines, meaning affected studios saw post-production efforts come to a grinding halt.\n\nThe problem centered on 2013 models of a Mac desktop affectionately referred to as 'the trashcan,' due to its cylindrical appearance, that were running editing software from the company Avid and older versions of Mac OS.\n\nVariety reports that in all, the snafu affected 'dozens of machines across multiple studios.'\n\nThe bug hit high-profile TV shows like ABC's 'Modern Family' which saw their entire editing team affected by the problem, reports Variety.", "description": "In a statement on Wednesday, Google said that an update to its widely used Google Chrome web browser was sent out with a bug that conflicted with movie-editing software made by Avid.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/16/4531726-0-image-a-5_1569426128199.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
