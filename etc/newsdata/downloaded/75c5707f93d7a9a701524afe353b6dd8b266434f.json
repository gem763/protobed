Making PI calls (or non-calls) reviewable is one of those decisions that makes sense on paper but subjecting this area of the game to greater scrutiny will \u2013 a bit like VAR in soccer \u2013 make us realize everything we don\u2019t like about the rules as they are currently written.\n\nGabriel Baumgaertner \u2026 Jets quarterback Sam Darnold. The second-year passer will finish in the top five of MVP voting and instantly become the best quarterback in franchise history once New York fans realize that Joe Namath was overrated.\n\nOliver Connolly \u2026 the little brothers. The Browns. The Lions. The Jets. The downtrodden and oft-scoffed at franchises will fight back against the stalwarts: The Bears, Steelers and Patriots (kind of).\n\nHunter Felt \u2026 more players taking themselves out of the game for health reasons. Andrew Luck\u2019s shocking departure will act as the tone-setter for this season: NFL players are well-aware of the long-term health effects involved with playing football and know that a single injury can ruin their lives.\n\nMelissa Jacobs \u2026 widespread inventive offense. With Sean McVay friend and disciples Zac Taylor, Mike LaFleur and Kliff Kingsbury stampeding the head-coaching ranks, not to mention Kyle Shanahan with a healthy arsenal, creative scheming should be the norm.\n\nBest team that won\u2019t make the playoffs\n\nNB The LA Chargers. Melvin Gordon is still holding out, Russell Okung\u2019s return date is uncertain as he recovers from a pulmonary embolism and Derwin James is on injured reserve. Or, to put it another way, Los Angeles are down their starting running back, best offensive tackle and an All-Pro safety.\n\nGB The Chicago Bears may have the league\u2019s best defense, but their league-leading 27 interceptions were a statistical outlier that is unlikely to repeat. Not even an elite defense will overcome the inconsistency of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and the team\u2019s woeful kicking situation.\n\nOC The Indianapolis Colts. Indy have everything \u2026 except for Andrew Luck. Jacoby Brissett will do enough to carry a loaded team close to the playoffs, but they\u2019ll just fall short.\n\nHF The Baltimore Ravens. The AFC North is going to be brutal. The Cleveland Browns have a genuine shot at winning the division (don\u2019t laugh) and the Pittsburgh Steelers are always in the playoff mix. This could leave the Ravens on the outside looking in, although none of that will be the fault of starting quarterback Lamar Jackson, who should improve as a passer in his sophomore campaign.\n\nMJ The San Francisco 49ers. Regular season Jimmy Garoppolo will look much better than preseason Jimmy G. Close but not quite playoff material yet.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Expect Baltimore\u2019s dual-threat quarterback Lamar Jackson to make a leap forward in his second NFL season. Photograph: Gail Burton/AP\n\nNon-playoff team from last year that will make the playoffs\n\nNB The Browns. Obvious, perhaps, but I\u2019ll back Cleveland to end their 16-year postseason drought.\n\nGB The Jets. There are legitimate concerns about a team with a new head coach (Adam Gase) and one that fired their general manager in May. Fortunately, New York have a budding star in second-year quarterback Sam Darnold. He will be a top-five QB by season\u2019s end with new weapons in running back Le\u2019Veon Bell and wide receiver Jamison Crowder. Add linebacker CJ Mosley to one of the league\u2019s top defenses and the Jets should nab one of the two AFC wild card spots.\n\nOC The Browns are the obvious answer. The talent on both sides of the ball, at all three levels, is ludicrous. One tidbit to monitor: Cleveland\u2019s line is below average, even in an era of stinky offensive line play.\n\nHF The Browns. After a standout season from Baker Mayfield, Cleveland made the decision to trade for wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr to boost their offense.\n\nMJ The Packers. Matt LaFleur should add enough spice to the playbook and the Aaron Rodgers-Davante Adams combo should be enough to return to the postseason.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Baker Mayfield\u2019s swagger transformed the woebegone Browns into must-see TV. Photograph: Mark LoMoglio/AP\n\nOne bold prediction\n\nNB Baltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson will lead the league in rushing touchdowns.\n\nGB The Dolphins won\u2019t be the league\u2019s worst team. The Cardinals, winners of three games in 2018, will regress in 2019 and win fewer games than rebuilding Miami.\n\nOC Ben Roethlisberger is benched. Look at the advanced analytics, and Big Ben was the league average in 2018. Any stat you want to go to, the Pittsburgh quarterback was between 15th and 18th in the league: accuracy, throwing under pressure, depth of target, on and on and on. He was fine, but not his usual self. The decline is already underway. The collapse will come sooner than most think.\n\nHF Given the myriad issues in the league (from non-guaranteed contracts to the long-term health impacts of the sport), it wouldn\u2019t be shocking if we hear rumbling about the first players\u2019 strike since 1987.\n\nMJ Tom Brady\u2019s physical tools will finally regress to the point of being a liability. The Pats will still be in the Super Bowl but Brady will have a difficult decision to make about his future.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The end could be closer than anticipated for Pittsburgh\u2019s Ben Roethlisberger, who turned 37 this offseason.

Instead, he\u2019ll be the Week 1 starter under rookie head coach Kliff Kingsbury, who compiled a 35-40 record as a college head coach and whose defenses finished 105th or lower for five consecutive seasons before his dismissal. Murray is a great player entering a horrendous situation.\n\nOC The Raiders. OK, so in one building we have: Antonio Brown, Jon Gruden, Mike Mayock, Richie Incognito, Vontaze Burfict, Mark Davis and the looming specter of a move to Vegas. Woof! Not even Derek Carr\u2019s blandness can save this inevitable calamity.\n\nHF The Miami Dolphins are desperately trying to tank, but what if starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has the tendency to play fantastic when nobody expects anything from him and incredibly badly when handed the keys, backfires and they win enough games to sink their draft position?\n\nMJ Beware more bizarre antics from Antonio Brown, especially once the Raiders start racking up losses. Trash-talking teammates and coaches, running off to Botswana, worshipping the color blue. With AB expect abnormal to be the norm.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s partnership with Jay-Z is \u2026\n\nNB \u2026 not going to make anyone forget how the league treated Colin Kaepernick.\n\nGB \u2026 further proof that Jay-Z is not just a businessman, he\u2019s a business, man! Whatever his aims are, it\u2019s a staggering decision to align himself with NFL owners.\n\nOC \u2026 a sham. Progress to profit, this was always going to be the way. Jay-Z sold out Colin Kaepernick and his fellow, peaceful protestors. The NFL got what it wanted: Kaepernick is out of the league, other players are now on notice, and they\u2019re able to make cash. It\u2019s disgusting.\n\nHF \u2026 incredibly devious. It\u2019s a brilliant marketing move that papers over a lot of ugliness in the league and the more I think about it, the more depressed I get.\n\nMJ \u2026 a strange branding move for Jay-Z that may help a few people but will never detract from the league\u2019s role in Colin Kaepernick\u2019s unemployment.\n\nMVP\n\nNB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. It\u2019s reasonable to expect some regression, but the conditions are all there for him to thrive again in Andy Reid\u2019s offense.\n\nGB Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. He\u2019ll become the first repeat winner of the league\u2019s highest individual honor since Peyton Manning in 2008 and 2009.\n\nOC Aaron Rodgers, Packers. Either a new staff revitalizes the most talented player (second now?) at the most valuable position in sports, or he\u2019s become some kind of uncoachable individualist who cannot work within a team construct, regardless of its construct. I\u2019m betting on the former; he\u2019s going to wreck the league.\n\nHF Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. His biggest obstacles? Well, there\u2019s the looming presence of Drew Brees, particularly if the Chiefs end with a worse record than the Saints, and the general difficulty of remaining fully healthy year in and year out in the NFL. Still, I believe.\n\nMJ Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs. As long as Mahomes is in the same stratosphere as last season\u2019s 50-touchdown extravaganza, this is his award to lose in 2019 and beyond.\n\nRookie of the year\n\nNB Josh Allen, Jaguars. There are two Josh Allens to keep an eye on in the NFL this season, but only one of them is a rookie pass rusher who I\u2019m expecting to light things up on a Jacksonville defense that could bounce back strongly in 2019.\n\nGB David Montgomery, Bears. The rookie running back from Iowa State will be thrust into head coach Matt Nagy\u2019s offense. He\u2019s a gifted pass-catching back and will be a necessary weapon for a quarterback as inconsistent as Trubisky.\n\nOC Mecole Hardman, Chiefs. Hardman might be the springiest athlete in the league. He was drafted to replace Tyreek Hill. Now, he\u2019ll play alongside him. If Hardman has four \u201cWow\u201d highlights, he\u2019ll clinch the award.\n\nHF Josh Jacobs, Raiders. No 1 overall pick Kyler Murray is probably the favorite to win this one, but there are always questions when it comes to a rookie quarterback. It\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see Jacobs put up some monster numbers with the Raiders while Murray takes his lumps. His new boss seems to believe that will happen.\n\nMJ Kyler Murray, Cardinals. Murray\u2019s talent and Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s playbook should help the rookie compile an undeniable highlight reel, thus securing an award that almost always goes to an offensive player.\n\nAFC East champion\n\nNB The Patriots, because of course.\n\nGB The Patriots last finished a season with fewer than double-digit wins was in 2002.\n\nOC The Patriots. Duh. Messrs Belichick, Brady, Scarnecchia and McDaniels are there. If those four are in or around the building, they win the AFC East. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nHF With Brady on the decline, and Rob Gronkowski retired, expect New England to take a step backward yet still clinch the division with ease.\n\nMJ The Patriots. The easiest division to call for a decade now. The Jets and Bills should improve but will be second-class citizens until Bill Belichick retires.\n\nAFC North champion\n\nNB The Browns. Ah, go on then, let\u2019s buy all the way into Cleveland hype. This is a fascinating division, though \u2013 I believe in John Harbaugh\u2019s ability to make the most of Lamar Jackson\u2019s skillset and Mark Ingram is an upgrade at running back, too. If the Steelers can stay competitive, as usual, it\u2019s going to be a close fight.\n\nGB The Ravens. Second-year quarterback Lamar Jackson is ready for a star turn, and the Baltimore offense will wear down opposing defenses with exhausting drives while their defense will provide its trademark tenacity.\n\nOC The Browns. If Cleveland wore different helmets, they would be co-favorites to win the Super Bowl alongside the defending champs.\n\nHF The Browns. This is saying something, since the Browns haven\u2019t won a division title since 1989 and haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2002. The Cavaliers won an NBA title and the Indians won the pennant back in 2016. It\u2019s the Browns\u2019 time.\n\nMJ The Ravens. Cleveland are the sexy pick but Lamar Jackson\u2019s progression and an elite secondary will help Baltimore prevail in a tight division.\n\nAFC South champion\n\nNB The Jaguars. So many questions for all of these teams. Can DeShaun Watson survive without an offensive line in Houston? Will Marcus Mariota ever become the star he was billed to be? Is there any hope for the Colts without Luck? I\u2019m not convinced that Nick Foles is going to be brilliant in Jacksonville, but he will be better than Blake Bortles, and that might be enough to vault the Jags to the top of the pile.\n\nGB The Colts. Even with Andrew Luck\u2019s shocking retirement, Indianapolis will start one of the league\u2019s more reliable backups in Jacoby Brissett while returning one of the game\u2019s best defensive players in Darius Leonard, a stacked offensive line and an extremely creative offensive mind in head coach Frank Reich.\n\nOC The Titans. I don\u2019t feel good about it, but it feels like they\u2019ve leapfrogged the Colts and Texans in the last fortnight.\n\nHF The Texans. With Luck out of the picture, Houston are going all-in, particularly with the trade for tackle Laremy Tunsil, although possibly sacrificing their long-term success in the process. Watch as the Texans win the division by default, potentially with a .500 record, lose in their first game of the playoffs and suffer buyer\u2019s remorse for the next few seasons.\n\nMJ The Jaguars. Jacksonville retained most of their key defensive starters and should again be a top-five unit. Nick Foles is a major upgrade over Blake Bortles.\n\nAFC West champion\n\nNB The Chiefs. Did I mention how much I\u2019m looking forward to watching Mahomes again?\n\nGB The Chargers. A toothless Chiefs defense means Los Angeles will shock the NFL and win the division. The holdout of running back Melvin Gordon denies quarterback Philip Rivers of one of his better weapons, but backup Austin Ekeler is a versatile piece and complements a host of talented playmakers between receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams as well as tight end Hunter Henry. Defensive ends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, arguably the league\u2019s most underrated defender, will terrorize opposing quarterbacks.\n\nOC The Chargers. They finished eighth in defensive DVOA last year and third in offensive DVOA. And they improved on both sides of the ball.\n\nHF The Chiefs. Here\u2019s where my Most Valuable Player pick has essentially made my choice for me. If Mahomes ends up being the regular-season MVP for a second straight season, that would probably necessitate him leading the Chiefs to their second straight AFC West title. The Chargers are going to make things interesting though.\n\nMJ The Chiefs. With Mahomes, Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, Kansas City have too much firepower. The Chargers are close but losing disruptive safety Derwin James really stings.\n\nAFC wild card teams\n\nNB Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos\n\nGB New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nOC Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens\n\nHF Pittsburgh Steelers, LA Chargers\n\nMJ Indianapolis Colts, Cleveland Browns\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The AFC East is the Patriots\u2019 division to lose as long as the Brady-Belichick union remains intact. Photograph: Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports\n\nNFC East champion\n\nNB The Eagles. If Carson Wentz can stay healthy, Philadelphia are a Super Bowl contender. That\u2019s a big if. Wentz made changes to his diet and workout schedule this offseason but his offensive line has been missing its entire right side in preseason. I\u2019m still taking Philly, and have high hopes for rookie running back Miles Sanders, but so much rests on the quarterback\u2019s ability to stay on the field.\n\nGB The Eagles. Philadelphia\u2019s offensive line has combined to start 378 games as members of the Eagles, an astonishing feat of consistency that should help protect oft-injured quarterback Carson Wentz. On defense, linebacker Zach Brown was one of the best under-the-radar signings of the offseason.\n\nOC The Eagles. Pull up Philadelphia\u2019s roster and try to find a hole. They are pretty much two-deep with league average talent at every single position.\n\nHF The Eagles. Bonus prediction: Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz will be the Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nMJ The Cowboys. With Zeke back and Kellen Moore calling plays, plus a fierce pair of inside linebackers, Dallas should hold off the feisty Eagles and claim the division.\n\nNFC North champion\n\nNB The Vikings. Are we really sure Mitch Trubisky is going to take that big step forward in Chicago? The Packers have made significant upgrades to their pass rush and still have Aaron Rodgers behind center. But I\u2019m taking Minnesota, who have an elite defense as well as brilliant offensive weapons in Dalvin Cook, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. Kirk Cousins has his limitations, but I trust him more than Trubisky.\n\nGB The Vikings. Kirk Cousins disappointed during his first season in Minnesota, but another year with receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs plus a reliable defense will help the Vikings outlast the Bears and Packers in one of the league\u2019s toughest divisions.\n\nOC The Packers. I\u2019ve picked Aaron Rodgers to win the MVP, so I\u2019ll give the division nod to Green Bay. I still think the Lions go deeper in the playoffs, though.\n\nHF The Packers. It will be up for Aaron Rodgers to prove that he\u2019s not done but a change in head coach might be just what he needs. The Bears\u2019 ravenous defense should be enough to push them into the postseason, however.\n\nMJ The Bears. Chicago\u2019s ridiculously stacked defense should give all NFL offenses nightmares. Also, Mitchell Trubisky is not the liability many think.\n\nNFC South champion\n\nNB The Falcons. I\u2019m worried about Cam Newton\u2019s shoulder. I also think that we may see a little regression from Drew Brees at 40 years old. Atlanta drafted to strengthen their offensive line but should be better in any case simply by virtue of having Keanu Neal, Ricardo Allen and Deion Jones \u2013 three key starters \u2013 back on defense after losing all three to injury early last year.\n\nGB The Saints. For years, New Orleans soared on offense while fielding some of the league\u2019s worst defenses. The presence of defensive lineman Cameron Jordan and one of the game\u2019s best secondaries has transformed the Saints into a complete unit that is equipped to make a deep playoff run.\n\nOC The Panthers. If Cam Newton\u2019s shoulder holds up, Carolina are as gifted as any team in the division.\n\nHF New Orleans were defeated in overtime by the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC championship game after the referees missed an easy pass interference call that would have put them in position to win in regulation. This will be their revenge season.\n\nMJ The Saints. New Orleans went 13-3 last season and probably should have been in the Super Bowl. They only got better in the offseason. No reason they shouldn\u2019t dominate the division again.\n\nNFC West champion\n\nNB The Rams have their problems, and it\u2019s possible that opponents have learned a thing or two about how to stop them from watching Super Bowl LIII. But this division is still theirs to lose.\n\nGB The Rams. Sean McVay enamored the world with his high-flying offense that anchored an unlikely Super Bowl berth. It\u2019s improbable that quarterback Jared Goff will be quite as good in 2019, but the Rams remain the class of the division.\n\nOC The Rams. We\u2019re at the start of a long Sean McVay-Jared Goff run in the West. Don\u2019t overthink it. Eric Weddle might be the most impactful pickup anywhere this offseason.\n\nHF The Rams. They still should be favorites to win the division but watch out for the Seattle Seahawks, who should challenge them throughout the rest of the season.\n\nMJ The Rams. Forget the last Super Bowl. They still boast a super-team roster and a head coach who schemes in his sleep.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A fully fit Carson Wentz should guide the Eagles to a third straight postseason berth.

Tom Brady continues to defy age and logic, exacting revenge on the Eagles team that defied him two years before. Brady, with nothing left to prove to anyone, confirms that he will be back to do it all again next year anyway.\n\nGB Saints over Ravens. In a thrilling clash of high-flying offense against punishing defense, Drew Brees finally overcomes the brutal playoff defeats that have ended the last two seasons in New Orleans before announcing his retirement. Lamar Jackson\u2019s valiant comeback ends short of the go-ahead touchdown, but Jackson\u2019s future brightens while one of the game\u2019s most prolific passers retires on top.\n\nOC Eagles over Patriots. When you have a top-five offensive line and top-five pass-rush, you should be winning Super Bowls.\n\nHF Saints over Chiefs. I want to say Kansas City here, but the fact is the Chiefs defense continues to lag well behind their offense. That\u2019s going to be a problem against Drew Brees and the Saints. In fact, if you\u2019re a betting person, take the over on the points allowed by Kansas City in this prediction.\n\nMJ Bears over Patriots. With incredible defensive line depth that gives defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano many personnel options, the Bears are built to withstand the Pats\u2019 various run schemes. Khalil Mack, Eddie Jackson and company will be able to disrupt Tom Brady just like the Rams did last season, Chicago will showcase their dynamic run attack and a signal-caller in Trubisky who people forget was a stud in the second half of the doink-y loss to Philly.", "description": "The NFL\u2019s 100th season kicks off Thursday night.
