Instead, austerity poses problems that compel us to examine how they affect people and families in their daily lives. The experiences of those individuals must be shared.\u201d\n\nSnopes is promising to get just as ridiculous with other left-wing causes, specifically when it comes to stopping Brexit and furthering the Global Warming Hoax:\n\nWhether examining Brexit, public austerity measures or the effects of climate change, one limitation is that facts and data generated through quantitative social research are presented as if detached from the people they concern as well as those involved in their production. Far removed from people\u2019s lived experiences, they risk displacing any sense of what it is to be human. As such, they are, perhaps, too easy to dismiss.\n\nThis is actually good news. The mask is now removed forever.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s a surrender on the part of Snopes, an admission that people are not falling for the selective facts and hand-picked experts that these fake fact-check sites use to avoid inconvenient truths, such as the fact that their so-called climate experts are 0-41 with their doomsday predictions.\n\nSo now, because alternative media is able to counter Snopes\u2019 non-stop bullshit with actual data, logic, and truth, these sore losers are going to resort to shameless and subjective acts of emotional blackmail.\n\nThat is what Snopes is announcing here\u2026 A totally one-sided campaign of emotional blackmail against Trump, Brexit, Johnson, and on behalf of the socialist crusade riding the Climate Change Hoax.\n\nIf you want to know how misguided, partisan, unprofessional, and desperate this is, consider the following\u2026 The personal, emotional, and feelings-filled stories Snopes will never tell, will ensure its stupid readers never get a chance to read\u2026\n\nOh, no, there will be no Snopes\u2019 stories laying out the terrible consequence on the rights of the individual crushed under central government totalitarianism. There will be no emotional blackmail on behalf of the human spirit smothered under the unelected bureaucrats who rule Europe, or the horror show that is the Green New Deal, or the violation of human conscience at the hands of a Democrat Party that is now openly pledging to confiscate our firearms, tax our churches out of existence, and destroy women\u2019s sports with this transsexual mania.\n\nJust as our confident belligerence in blasting CNN with the Truth has forced that garbage fire to reveal its terrible and true self at the cost of its viewers and credibility, so too are we chipping away at Snopes\u2019 composure and phony veneer of objectivity.\n\nThis is a huge victory.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
