Here\u2019s What You Need to Know.", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s obvious once you take a moment to think about it: Store-bought dog food can\u2019t possibly be tailored to your best friend\u2019s needs. High volume production and long shelf life don\u2019t usually result in a fresh or personalized product. That\u2019s what motivated the Breuer family to start cooking their own dog food, eventually turning their recipes and fresh-forward philosophy into Spot & Tango. With these family recipes, survey data from dog owners, and consultations from veterinarians and nutritionists, Spot & Tango creates personalized dog food that your best furry friend will love. Right now, they're giving Daily Beast readers 60% off to give it a try when you enter DAILYBEAST60 at checkout.\n\nHere\u2019s Spot & Tango how it works: You fill out your dog\u2019s profile, noting everything from breed and age to weight, fitness level, and dietary needs. Then Spot & Tango cooks fresh meals for your dog that are delivered every two or four weeks, depending on the meal plan you select. Each antibiotic- and GMO-free meal is comprised of locally sourced ingredients: proteins like beef and turkey, nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables like apples and leafy greens, healthy carbs like quinoa or brown rice, and so on. The pre-portioned and ready-to-serve meals are delivered to your door in sustainable, eco-friendly packaging. (No more late night and last-minute grocery trips for whatever-you-can-find variety dog food.)\n\nSpeaking of which, what exactly is in a Spot & Tango meal? Here\u2019s one example: The Turkey & Red Quinoa meal plan combines those two with spinach, carrots, peas, apples, egg, parsley, vegetable stock, and naturally blended vitamins and minerals specifically suited for your dog\u2019s needs. Want the complete nutritional breakdown of the meal? Sure: Take the quiz, and you'll find details for each recipe. Shipping is free on all meals and if your dog doesn\u2019t like its new dinners, you get all of your money back (that type of confidence is notable). Start feeding your dog with food that\u2019s based on what it actually needs with Spot & Tango \u2013 and don't forget to use DAILYBEAST60 at checkout. It\u2019s a no-brainer. | Shop at Spot & Tango >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse. Follow us on Twitter and sign up for our newsletter for even more recommendations and exclusive content.
