To think that I can possibly help and impact the people going through stuff like that is incredible to me.\u2019\n\nLacey was confirmed for the first female wrestling match in Saudi Arabia today (Picture: WWE)\n\nThe star \u2013 who would like to conduct seminars to help inspire young women and college students \u2013 is proud of having the opportunity to use her platform to make a real, positive change for fans around the world.\n\nAnd she pointed out that it\u2019s a chance given to her by WWE, as the stars find themselves in a unique position to engage with people in a way other performers don\u2019t always get to do.\n\n\u2018People are hurting, they\u2019re suffering, they\u2019re tired, they wanna give up. Drug addiction, depression \u2013 this is stuff that people face. Mental instability, people face this every single day,\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018To think that as a sports entertainer \u2013 or someone who has been through that \u2013 I can stand up and tell them that this too shall pass, that this isn\u2019t how your life will be as long as you wanna change it. We have the voice to say those things and I love it.\u2019\n\nLacey Evans\u2019 dreams expand beyond the ring (Picture: WWE)\n\nOn screen, Lacey plays an arrogant, determined and outspoken character \u2013 and she admitted there has to be an element of truth to any in-ring alter ego for fans to really engage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, when it comes to her career goals, Lacey insisted her real focus isn\u2019t on fame and in-ring \u201csuccess\u201d, but instead her dreams go far deeper.\n\n\u201cI would like to see it impact and help the depression and addiction side of life because that hits me so hard. My hardest days in WWE, when I\u2019m tired, when I\u2019m the most sore, that\u2019s what I always revert back to and keep in my mind,\u2019 she said. \u2018That\u2019s my mission.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, I\u2019d love to be in the Hall of Fame, I\u2019d love to make people remember the WWE superstar, but at the end of the day if they can just remember what Lacey Evans stood for in regards to a hard life and making people realise that it does not matter where you come from \u2013 you can do anything\u2026\n\n\u2018You need to get up, wash your face and battle the day \u2013 literally. That\u2019s how you\u2019re gonna be successful. Not money wise, I\u2019m talking about successful, not depressed. I\u2019m talking about successful, not sitting in a dark room because there\u2019s no reason to get up. When you can find happiness, that\u2019s success \u2013 and that\u2019s my goal.\u2019\n\n*Friday Night SmackDown airs every week at 1am on Sky Sports Arena and Main Event.
