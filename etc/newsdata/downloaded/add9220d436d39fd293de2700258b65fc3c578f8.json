The key thing is the implementation of the extension of article 50.\u201d\n\nAsked if the bill was watertight, Sir Ed said: \u201cI\u2019ve certainly seen the opinion of a number of very notable lawyers, that it\u2019s not watertight \u2013 and if that\u2019s the case we may need another bill to ensure that no-deal Brexit is completely taken off the table.\n\n\"But even with another bill, we have to force the prime minister to extend article 50 to get to this implementation, as well as the law.\"\n\nDespite calls for Mr Johnson to quit, opposition leaders are reluctant to table a motion of no confidence to oust him in case he refuses to comply with the provisions set out in the Benn act.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
