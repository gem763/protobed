(AP) \u2014 The sunsets are a sight to behold in Joe Leonard\u2019s neck of the woods these days. A year ago, lush stands of towering pines obscured the horizon, he said as he drove his pickup along a dusty Florida Panhandle road. Now, fields of thick grass mask row after row of stumps decaying into the soil that has sustained his family for five generations.\n\nUp the road, heaps of rotting logs lay bare the scars that Hurricane Michael left last October when it ploughed through the region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe how sick I felt when I came out here,\u201d Leonard said as he surveyed a stand of snapped 30-year-old slash pine, their trunks big enough for a full bear hug.\n\nThe massive storm crashed ashore as a Category 5 hurricane with winds exceeding 160 mph (255 kph), the strongest ever recorded to hit Florida\u2019s northern Gulf Coast. The storm killed more than two dozen people in the region, destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes and wrought catastrophic damage on the region\u2019s timber industry.\n\nIt\u2019s been an excruciating year for the Leonards and other Panhandle families who make their living off the land. A year after Michael, they face wrenching decisions about how to carry on.\n\nLess than a fifth of the 2.8 million acres (1.1 million hectares) of timberland destroyed by Hurricane Michael have been salvaged. Tons of timber will most likely be left to rot. There are so many fallen logs that they\u2019d fill more than 2.6 million logging trucks, which would circle the equator 1.5 times if parked end on end.\n\nTrees once towered over much of Calhoun County, an inland expanse of tiny communities surrounded by forests that suffered the most catastrophic damage to the region\u2019s timberland.\n\nStands of pines, once just steps from Leonard\u2019s front door, are now mostly gone.\n\n\u201cOne of the benefits is that now we see sunrises and sunsets in a way we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said.\n\nWithout financial help, some timber farmers are looking for buyers.\n\nFederal relief hasn\u2019t come fast enough, even though the government authorized a $19 billion relief package \u2014 held in limbo until this past summer because of political clashes in Washington \u2014 to assist communities across the country hit by wildfires, flooding, tornadoes and hurricanes. Florida officials estimate that the timber industry sustained nearly $1.3 billion in losses.\n\nAcross the road from the Leonards, Michael Eldridge isn\u2019t expecting any help soon as he continues to grapple with the devastation Michael wrought across his 360 acres (145 hectares).\n\n\u201cThere was nothing standing,\u201d he said. \u201cPitiful. Unbelievable. All these 33-year-old trees down like pick-up sticks, all laying atop one another.\u201d\n\nHe sold his entire herd of cattle \u2014 113 cows, bulls and calves \u2014 instead of spending the money to rebuild fences that went down with his trees.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I planted them as a supplement to our retirement, and it didn\u2019t work out that way,\u201d said Eldridge, who has lived in Calhoun County all of his 72 years. \u201cI thought it was a good investment.\u201d\n\nFor now, there are no plans to sell. Where else would he go; what else would he do?\n\n\u201cI might as well stay here fighting,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do until the day I die.\u201d\n\nLike Eldridge, many of the region\u2019s timber growers operate mom-and-pop farms, some a couple dozen acres and others in the thousands. Unlike corporate landowners, few of these small-time tree growers can withstand upheavals like Michael.\n\nUnlike cotton and oranges, timber isn\u2019t usually insurable for loss. And unlike row crops that can bounce back more quickly, trees require generations to recover. A tree needs a dozen years before being harvested for pulp \u2014 and at least twice that time to harden into more lucrative lumber.\n\nFor some farmers, the new math doesn\u2019t add up, according to Alan Shelby, the executive vice president of the Florida Forestry Association.\n\n\u201cThere are many who simply don\u2019t have the money to clean it up. They may try and sell the property. Or they may just leave it and let Mother Nature take its course,\u201d Shelby said.\n\nBy some estimates, an acre of 30-year-old trees might fetch about $2,500. Clearing an acre of downed trees and replanting costs about $1,300 up front.\n\n\u201cIt takes more than a broom and it takes more than your typical farm equipment,\u201d he said.\n\nIt requires an army of loggers and equipment operators with chain saws and timber loaders to hoist fallen logs onto trucks.\n\nAll that requires loads of money, as well as a strong will to carry on, said Leonard, 59, whose family arrived in northern Florida from the Carolinas in the early 1900s.\n\n\u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t want to sell. My brother and I aren\u2019t going to sell. But what happens after we\u2019re gone?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\nHis son Daniel, 28, expresses some of the uncertainty.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I\u2019m not advocating that we go totally back to the timber. I would rather see us do something else. Let\u2019s diversify a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\nHis cousin Will Leonard, 29, a forester, also wonders how timber communities across the Panhandle will fare in the years to come, with the possibility that some mills could fall silent and jobs dwindle because of the catastrophic losses.\n\n\u201cThis is a story that is going to have a much broader impact. It\u2019s not just about the growers,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the family farm, Daniel Leonard spoke of the fallen pines\u2019 rings, each representing a year in the tree\u2019s life but also recording the years his father, grandfather and those before them spent nurturing a livelihood they hoped would span generations.\n\n\u201cThese trees have lots of stories to tell, but I\u2019m sure they hadn\u2019t seen anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cHurricane Michael was a once-in-a-generation kind of thing. Will we have another one in 20 years? I\u2019m not so comfortable taking that risk.\u201d\n\n____\n\nFollow Bobby Caina Calvan at http://twitter.com/bobbycalvan", "description": "BLOUNTSTOWN, Fla.
