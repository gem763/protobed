It's the first time the agency has allowed product marketing of this type.\n\nWhat that means is that there are now eight Swedish Match USA Inc. snus products sold under the General brand name that will be able to market with a claim that the products are essentially less harmful than traditional cigarettes.\n\nIn the FDA announcement on Tuesday, the agency said that just because there is a modified risk claim, it doesn't mean snus is FDA approved.\n\n\"All tobacco products are potentially harmful and addictive, and those who do not use tobacco products should continue to refrain from their use,\" the FDA said.\n\nFDA to continue monitoring product\n\nThe FDA said it made the decision after reviewing scientific evidence submitted by the company. It had to show that snus wouldn't encourage people who don't use tobacco products to start using them. The company also had to demonstrate that people who intended to quit smoking altogether didn't instead switch to snus.\n\nThe FDA said the company met these standards and \"the modified risk products, as actually used by consumers, will significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users and benefit the health of the population as a whole.\"\n\nEpidemiological studies show that exclusive use of snus, compared to cigarette smoking, poses a lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis, according to the FDA.\n\nThe FDA also added that there is no evidence that there is \"significant youth initiation of these products.\"\n\nThe modified risk orders have a five-year time limit. The FDA will continue to monitor the product.\n\n\"In addition to stringent restrictions to limit youth access and exposure to advertising, this time-limited authorization comes with a number of postmarket requirements that will allow us to keep a close watch on the marketplace,\" said Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Ned Sharpless in an agency release. \"Should any information lead us to determine that the marketing of these products as posing less risk no longer benefits the health of the population as a whole, the agency would consider withdrawing this authorization.\"\n\nOrganizations argued against the change\n\nThe American Lung Association, along with several other health advocacy organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids submitted testimony to the FDA in May arguing against allowing the companies to make these claims.\n\nThe organizations argued that there was insufficient evidence on the impact of the marketing of General snus with modified risk claims on the increased likelihood of tobacco use initiation by non-users, particularly by kids.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Although there are obvious distinctions between e-cigarettes like JUUL and smokeless tobacco products like General snus, the fact that another kind of highly-addictive 'reduced risk' product is proving so appealing to young people, in part because it can be used discreetly, should cause FDA to closely scrutinize the potential impact of modified risk claims for General snus on youth initiation,\" the letter to the FDA said.\n\nThere is also concern that adults wouldn't quit cigarettes, and instead would use snus in addition to cigarettes.", "description": "For the first time, advertisements for one brand of snus can say that using the smokeless tobacco product \"instead of cigarettes puts you at a lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.\"", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191022150920-snus-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
