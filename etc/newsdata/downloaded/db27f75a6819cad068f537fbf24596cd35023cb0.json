Mulvaney did not explain how his boss could promise the use of his resort for free or at cost if he no longer managed it directly, but in an interview on Fox News Sunday Mulvaney observed that \u201cat the end of the day he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\nDemocrats weren\u2019t the only ones raising concerns that the plan would have violated the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits government officials from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.\n\n\u201cHolding the G-7 at a Trump property is one of the most foolish, unseemly things the [White House] could do,\u201d Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush, tweeted after the initial plan was announced. \u201cThe President enjoys waiving red flags in front of bulls, but this fight isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\nTrump dismissed the idea that he could be subject to such constraints.\n\n\u201cYou people with this phony Emoluments Clause,\u201d the president said.\n\nPresident Trump speaks before a Cabinet meeting on Monday. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) More\n\nCritics said that even if Trump didn\u2019t profit directly from the event, hosting the prestigious meeting of heads of state represents an enormous branding opportunity for Trump\u2019s resort business.\n\nTrump dismissed that criticism, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need promotion. I don\u2019t need promotion,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cIt would have been the best G-7 ever.\u201d\n\nTrump then wondered aloud why there was no uproar when former President Barack Obama signed deals for book and television projects.\n\n\u201cObama made a deal for a book. Did he run a business?\u201d Trump asked reporters. \u201cHe has a deal with Netflix. When did they start talking about that?\u201d\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama signed a joint book deal for a reported $65 million in March 2017, two months after Trump\u2019s inauguration; they signed production deal with Netflix in May 2018 \u2014 more than a year after leaving office.\n\nTrump touted the decision to donate his $400,000 annual presidential salary to charity as proof he doesn\u2019t care about profiting from the office.\n\nHe also falsely claimed no president other than him has refused a salary; Presidents Herbert Hoover and John F. Kennedy donated theirs.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump estimated it has cost him $2 billion to $5 billion \u201cbetween what I lose and what I could\u2019ve made\u201d to be president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re rich it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more coverage from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump on Monday defended his initial plan to host next year\u2019s summit of world leaders at his golf resort near Miami, dismissing concerns that he would have personally profited from the decision.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B5rwRzE4z9WP9UTbgXkXOg--~B/aD0zNjI3O3c9NTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/55d79180-f42c-11e9-bcfb-85a2fbffbb1b", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
