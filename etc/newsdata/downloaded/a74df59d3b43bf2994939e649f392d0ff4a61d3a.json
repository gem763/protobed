Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nVazquez, 28, is being held in the Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh awaiting extradition to Lee County, Fla. He was placed on administrative leave and the restricted list by Major League Baseball.\n\nAccording the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Vazquez was arrested by the Pennsylvania State Police on a felony warrant and faces one count of computer pornography-solicitation of a child and one count of providing obscene material to minors.\n\nThe Florida agency began investigating Vazquez in August after receiving reports that he had been involved in a sexual relationship with a teenager since she was 13 years old in Lee County, located in southwestern Florida.\n\n\u2014Outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, who has appeared in just nine games this season due to multiple injuries, figures to be back in the New York Yankees\u2019 lineup within the next two days.\n\nStanton last appeared June 25 before spraining his right knee. That game was just his sixth since returning from a 2 1/2-month stint on the injured list.\n\nRegarding Stanton\u2019s status, Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that tonight with the trainers and with Giancarlo. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a chance he could be activated (Wednesday). Otherwise I would certainly expect Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u2014San Francisco Giants outfielder Mike Yastrzemski homered in his first game at Fenway Park, the former home venue of his grandfather, Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski.\n\nMike Yastrzemski stepped up with two outs and nobody on in the fourth inning of the Giants\u2019 game against the Boston Red Sox and unloaded on a 96 mph fastball from Nathan Eovaldi for a solo shot to deep center, his 20th homer of the season.\n\nBefore the game, Yastrzemski caught up on the field with his grandfather, who played for Boston from 1961-83. In that time, Carl Yastrzemski won an American League MVP, amassed 18 All-Star selections and slugged 452 career home runs among 3,419 hits.\n\n\u2014Hall of Fame manager Whitey Herzog had a minor stroke Monday during his charity golf tournament, the St. Louis Cardinals announced.\n\n\u201cWhitey and his family wanted to let everyone know that he has received treatment and is currently resting, and doing well,\u201d the Cardinals wrote in a statement. \u201cWhitey is hoping for a quick recovery, and he and his family are very appreciative of the caring support that everyone has shown them.\u201d\n\nHerzog, 87, led the Cardinals to the 1982 World Series championship and guided St. Louis to National League titles in 1985 and 1987, highlighting an 18-year managerial career. The Veterans Committee elected Herzog to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\n\u2014Cleveland Indians second baseman Jason Kipnis will miss the rest of the season with a broken bone in his right wrist.\n\nKipnis left Sunday\u2019s game against Minnesota after experiencing discomfort on a swing and miss. On Monday, an MRI revealed a fracture of his hamate bone.\n\nThe 32-year-old veteran batted .245 with 17 homers, 23 doubles, 65 RBIs and 52 runs in 121 games this season.\n\n\u2014The Philadelphia Phillies, still pushing for the playoffs, put outfielder Corey Dickerson on the 60-day injured list because of fractured left foot.\n\nDickerson fouled a ball off the foot on Sept. 4 and played for the following week, but he made his final appearance in a game on Sept. 11. Initial X-rays on the foot had been negative.\n\nDickerson, acquired in a trade with Pittsburgh on July 31, hit .293 with eight home runs and 34 RBIs in 34 games for the Phillies. Overall, the 30-year-old batted .304 with 12 homers and 59 RBIs in 78 games this season.\n\n\u2014Milwaukee Brewers right-hander Brandon Woodruff made his first start since July 21 after the team activated him from the injury list.\n\nWoodruff, 26, struck out four batters over two scoreless innings against the San Diego Padres. He had been out because of an oblique strain.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Pittsburgh Pirates All-Star closer Felipe Vazquez is in police custody on multiple charges, including solicitation of a child, authorities said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431066594&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H06G-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
