The iPhone 11 Pro devices are the same price as the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max when they were launched in 2018.\n\nThat price drop for the cheapest model, and the staying of the course with the higher-end models, comes even under the shadow of the 15% tariff increase proposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese imports, including Apple products, reported by Bloomberg.\n\nTrump's tariffs aren't said to affect Apple's iPhone prices until December, but Apple apparently hasn't baked in the extra tariffs into its new iPhone pricing. It's unclear if Apple will raise the price of its iPhones in December \u2014 when the tariffs go into effect \u2014 or whether the company will simply absorb the costs. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said Apple is more likely to absorb the tariffs, the firm wrote in a report from May.\n\nApple experienced a decline in iPhone sales in 2019, which some say is a result of rising iPhone prices. Offering cheaper iPhones despite any rising tariffs may bring those sales numbers back up.\n\nCEO Tim Cook has been a staunch opponent of the tariffs, suggesting that they may actually hurt American companies like Apple itself, and that they could help its Korean competitor, Samsung.\n\nNow tell us what you think!", "description": "Trump's tariffs aren't expected to affect iPhones until December.
