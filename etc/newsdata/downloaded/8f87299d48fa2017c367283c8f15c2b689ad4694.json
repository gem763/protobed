The British Business Bank is state-owned and often commits capital to new funds.\n\nAda Partners is named in Companies House with Warner and Penneycard as officers while a website entry reads: \"See what's possible. Coming soon.\"\n\nWarner declined to comment.\n\nAda Lovelace was a mathematician and pioneer in the field of computer science, and is thought to have written the first algorithm for Charles Babbage's \"Analytical Engine\", a very early computer. She was the only legitimate child of famed poet Lord Byron.\n\nSome of Penneycard's prior investments include Twizoo, a user generated social content company which was bought by Skyscanner in 2017 and Smile Identity, an emerging markets user verification app.\n\nWarner has made her mark on the European investment scene as the cofounder of Diversity VC, a lobby group that highlights the lack of diversity among startup investors. Diversity VC found that a tiny proportion of the top decision-makers at investment firms were women, and many firms have zero female representation. The group's research has been a wake-up call to the industry. Warner cofounded the group alongside Travis Winstanley, Lillian Li, Anna Huyghues-Despointes, and Farooq Abassi, in 2016.\n\nAdditional reporting by Shona Ghosh.", "description": "Check Warner, cofounder of Diversity VC, is raising a $30 million fund called Ada Ventures alongside angel investor Matt Penneycard.", "authors": ["Callum Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a4cc0a1396e37a10e8b46a9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
