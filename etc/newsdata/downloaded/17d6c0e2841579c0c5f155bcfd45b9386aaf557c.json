Especially on the Korean Tour.\n\nBio Kim, the Korean Tour\u2019s leading money winner this season, has been suspended for an astounding three years after losing his temper and flipping the bird in the midst of a round. (Folks, you\u2019re going to feel the temptation to make some terrible bird-birdie joke here. Resist that temptation. Aim higher.)\n\nAt the DGB Financial Group Volvik Daegu Gyeongbuk Open \u2014 and you thought Corales Puntacana Resort & Club Championship was a mouthful \u2014 Kim apparently grew enraged when a camera clicked during his tee shot. He flicked off the photographer, slammed his club into the turf, and stormed off down the fairway.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHere\u2019s video of the event, with the horrifying bird blurred out to spare tender viewers:\n\nApparently the offending camera clicker didn\u2019t offend Kim too much, because he managed to win the tournament too.\n\nHe apologized for the incident, but the Korean Tour brought the hammer, unanimously voting to suspend Kim for three years. He was also fined the U.S. equivalent of $8,350, which seems a far more reasonable punishment. \u201cKim Bi-o damaged the dignity of a golfer with etiquette violation and inappropriate behavior,\u201d the Korean Tour said in a statement.\n\nKim played briefly on the PGA Tour in the early 2010s, and now he might be back. He was the Korean Tour\u2019s money leader at the time of his suspension.\n\nBio Kim, seen here in 2013 at the U.S. Open. (Getty)\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
