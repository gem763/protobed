(CSE: MGRO) (OTC: MGROF) (the \"Company\", \"MustGrow\"), an agricultural biotech company developing and commercializing a portfolio of natural, science-based bio-pesticides and bio-fertility products, is pleased to announce the finalization of its advanced liquid formulation (\"Liquid Formulation\"). The Liquid Formulation is an advancement of MustGrow\u2019s signature mustard-derived \u2018granule format\u2019 bio-pesticide product. Unlike the granule format, the advanced Liquid Formulation may be applied through standard drip or spray equipment, improving functionality and performance features such as:\n\nHigher concentration of the active ingredient requires less product per acre;\n\nMore efficacious results per volume;\n\nConvenient drip-line or spray application; and\n\nLower transportation costs and ease-of-use due to less weight, less volume, less bulkiness.\n\nThe finalization of the Liquid Formulation is a particularly exciting milestone for fruits & vegetables growers seeking a \u2018natural biological\u2019 alternative to \u2018chemistry-based\u2019 products, some of which are dangerous to human health.\n\nMustGrow\u2019s Liquid Formulation work program was completed by Canada\u2019s prominent federal research & development organization, National Research Council Canada. The NRC evaluated control of hard-to-kill soil-borne diseases and application use-rates \u2013 particularly diseases that have been problematic for many of Canada\u2019s licensed cannabis producers, including but not limited to:\n\nBotrytis (Gray Mold, Bud Rot) , a serious and common disease often brought into facilities via contaminated soil; and\n\n, a serious and common disease often brought into facilities via contaminated soil; and Fusarium & Rhizocotonia (Root Rot), known to destroy entire cannabis rooms and can lay dormant in both soil and waterlines for years before it becomes active and detrimental.\n\nEfficacy Results: Both Effective and Economic\n\nUsing MustGrow\u2019s Liquid Formulation, NRC achieved 100% control of hard-to-kill soil borne diseases such as Botrytis and Fusarium. To determine economic viability of the Liquid Formulation, NRC also tested the lowest effective application use-rates: >95% control was achieved at rates as low as 2.5 gal/acre, believed by the Company to be an economically-feasible application rate in fruits, vegetables, turf, ornamental, cannabis and hemp farming operations.\n\nMustGrow is undertaking further testing to assess efficacy on additional pests as well as other broad market applications in the food value chain, including storage container fumigation.\n\nMustGrow\u2019s Liquid Formulation is derived from mustard seed, utilizing the plant\u2019s natural defense mechanism as a pre-plant soil bio-pesticide. Organic compounds found in mustard seed, combined with water, form allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), which is the active ingredient. MustGrow has concentrated the active ingredient in both granular and now liquid format to maximize safety and efficacy. MustGrow\u2019s granular product is EPA-approved across all key U.S. states as a bio-fertilizer and bio-pesticide (currently limited to a fertilizer in California) and is designated by Health Canada\u2019s PMRA (Pest Management Regulatory Agency) as a fruit, vegetable, turf and ornamental bio-pesticide and bio-fertilizer.\n\nBackground: Chemistries vs. Biologicals\n\nMustGrow\u2019s signature mustard-derived products have consistently demonstrated efficacious benefits similar to chemistry-based \"chemical\" products without the harmful safety profile often associated with these chemical products. \"Biological\" products are traditionally less efficacious than chemical products. Biologicals typically only have suppression labels which is less than 75% control, requiring frequent re-entry and re-application intervals. However, previous MustGrow product testing in soil used for fruits & vegetables have indicated greater than 95% control (more than just suppression) of soil-borne pests and diseases \u2013 in some cases 100% control of Root Knot Nematodes compared to dangerous chemistry-based products such as Methyl Bromide.\n\nAbout MustGrow\n\nMustGrow is a publicly traded (CSE: MGRO) (OTC: MGROF) agricultural biotech company focused on providing natural science-based biological solutions for cannabis and fruit & vegetable cultivation. In cannabis, the Company is currently developing reliable, safe and biological solutions that adhere to Health Canada\u2019s strict regulations. The Company currently has three products suited for the cannabis market: a mustard-derived bio-pesticide, CannaProtector\u00ae, to treat soil borne pests and diseases; a bio-fungicide, CannaVate\u00ae, that can be used a foliar application for powdery mildew; and a bio-fertility product, TP-1000, to increase yield, THC and terpene levels. CannaVate\u00ae and TP-1000 are in-licenced products for which MustGrow has exclusive rights in Canada. CannaProtector\u00ae is based on MustGrow\u2019s patented natural biologic technology made from mustard seed that acts as a bio-pesticide.\n\nMustGrow\u2019s granular product is a United States EPA-approved organic solution that uses the mustard seed\u2019s natural defence mechanism to protect plants from pests and diseases. Approximately CDN $10 million has been spent and over 110 independent tests completed, validating MustGrow\u2019s safe and effective granular product. This product, which contains the same active ingredients as CannaProtector\u00ae, is EPA-approved across all key U.S. states as a fertilizer and pesticide (currently limited to fertilizer in California) and is designated by Health Canada\u2019s PMRA (Pest Management Regulatory Agency) as a fruit & vegetable bio-pesticide and fertilizer.\n\nMustGrow is positioning CannaProtector\u00ae as an effective pre-plant soil treatment, reducing the chance for any soil introduced to a greenhouse to bring in pests and diseases. The Company expects its bio-pesticide will help licensed cannabis producers control the same conditions addressed in fruit and vegetable crops.\n\nThe Company has approximately 25.0 million basic common shares issued and outstanding and approximately 36.9 million on a fully diluted basis.
