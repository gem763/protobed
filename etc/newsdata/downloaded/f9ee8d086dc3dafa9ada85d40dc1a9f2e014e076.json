Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the world's largest pile of reserves to fall $12 billion in September from August.\n\nChina's foreign-exchange regulator, an arm of the central bank, said in a separate statement after the data that the fall was mainly due to declines of bond prices in major economies and a stronger U.S. dollar that depreciated the value of nondollar assets.\n\nWhile market volatilities increased amid trade protectionism, the regulator said the resilient Chinese economy could provide a support to stabilize its foreign-exchange reserves that have risen $19.7 billion in the first nine months of the year.\n\nChinese authorities have refrained from burning through the country's vast reserves to shore up the yuan amid rising depreciation pressure, but instead resorted to other measures such as issuing central bank bills in the offshore market to rein in short-selling of the Chinese currency.\n\n--Grace Zhu\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 06, 2019 08:03 ET (12:03 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
