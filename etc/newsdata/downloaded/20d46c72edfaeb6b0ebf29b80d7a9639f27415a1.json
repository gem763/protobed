Sources say the departure was due to disagreements and suspicions that Bolton was involved in leaks.\n\nThe shocking announcement came less than two hours before Bolton was set to participate in a press briefing at the White House with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. That briefing was announced on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore \u2026 I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nBolton issued a tweet of his own about the firing shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Bolton wrote.\n\nBolton could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Yahoo News that philosophical differences were behind Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton outside the White House in April.

The source said this included disagreements over strategy for Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nA second source echoed the notion that Bolton clashed with the president, particularly regarding Iran and Afghanistan. They said Trump and others had come to view Bolton as \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201csmug.\u201d The source further claimed that Pompeo had also become dissatisfied with Bolton and encouraged the president to remove him.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBolton, who served as U.N. ambassador in the administration of President George W. Bush, is known for advocating hawkish approaches to foreign policy. He became Trump\u2019s third national security adviser in 2018 after the departure of H.R. McMaster, a former Army lieutenant general who held the position after the brief tenure of retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.\n\nA third source close to the president said Bolton had \u201ctoo many strikes\u201d against him. They said Bolton drew the president\u2019s ire in three areas: \u201cVenezuela, Iran and leaks.\u201d Bolton pushed for more aggressive responses to the situations in Venezuela and Iran than Trump was comfortable with, according to the source. They also said the White House grew suspicious because it \u201calways leaks\u201d when Bolton disagreed with Trump on something.\n\nPresident Trump listens as Bolton speaks during a presidential memorandum signing in the Oval Office in February.
