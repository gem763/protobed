Some of the money was kept in offshore accounts with weaker controls.\n\nTurkey gave Somalia $20 million in cash, but there was no independent audit trail for it, the report said. \u201cThere is a risk that external assistance from Turkey was not banked intact in the Treasury single account in a timely manner,\u201d it read.\n\nThe police and military - in the frontline of the fight against an al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency - still have no system to account for vehicles, weapons, and uniforms, according to a more detailed audit of the security sector, also published on Wednesday.\n\nSome food provided to soldiers through a government contract had expired and it was still unclear how many soldiers are actually in the army, that audit said, flagging a long-running problem donors have tried to address with a biometric database.\n\nSome donors pay monthly stipends to troops listed in their database because the soldiers\u2019 government paychecks often do not arrive.\n\nThe Somali government, which has no database of its own, also continues to say it has more soldiers than the donors have documented. About 99% of soldiers are paid in cash, the report found.\n\n\u201cThe lack of a computerized database increases the risk of \u201cghost personnel\u201d being included in the payroll,\u201d the audit noted.\n\nJarat Chopra, a former World Bank official who worked on Somalia, said the audit showed that Somali financial systems remained weak despite pressure on donors to funnel more money through the government budget.\n\n\u201cOn-budget support by itself as a means to improve accountability doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because you put money through systems doesn\u2019t mean you improve those systems.\u201d\n\nThe finance minister did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "The Somali government is keeping some donor funds offshore and none of the ministries have completed last year's accounts, the auditor general said in a report published on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Abdi Sheikh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
