Sensitivity, even vulnerability, is as important to marvelous art as craftsmanship.\n\nDuring Burns\u2019 episode that depicts the rise of Merle Haggard from an inmate at San Quentin prison to one of American music\u2019s best and most successful songwriters, Dwight Yoakam recites the second verse of Haggard\u2019s original composition, \u201cHolding Things Together\u201d\u2014a traditional country ballad about a man whose wife has abandoned him and his daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday was Angie\u2019s birthday\n\nI guess it slipped your mind\n\nI tried twice to call you\n\nBut no answer either time\n\nBut the postman brought a present\n\nI mailed some days ago\n\nI just signed it love from mama\n\nSo Angie wouldn\u2019t know\n\nDwight Yoakam, the singer/songwriter who injected rock \u2019n roll swagger into a blend of the country his parents first introduced to him in Kentucky and the honky tonk style he learned in California, pauses during his reading of the lyrics to collect his breath and stop his tears. The multitudes of poetry and sensitivity that Haggard contained to write that song, and the fullness of feeling that Yoakam demonstrated in his plaintive recollection of the lyrics, delineates character, gravitas, and humanity dreadfully absent in American culture.\n\nBill Malone, a country music historian, explains in Burns\u2019 series that one of the animating ideas throughout the genre\u2019s history is nostalgia. The feeling, right or wrong, that the past was better than the present inspires many of country\u2019s greatest songs. Everything from the Carter Family\u2019s \u201cWill You Miss Me When I\u2019m Gone?\u201d of 1935, to Alan Jackson\u2019s 2009 hit, \u201cRemember When,\u201d couples mournful lyrics with, to use Abraham Lincoln\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe mystic chords of memory.\u201d\n\nMany American pundits and activists succumb to the temptation of condemning nearly every aspect of history according to modern moral standards. While we can all celebrate the progress of our society in rejecting slavery and the subjugation of women, we should also have a little humility. That ancient check on human arrogance is necessary not only to maintain respect for our ancestry and history, but also because comparing present day American culture with the past might not be so flattering.\n\nThe most popular performance from the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards was a medley of recent hits from Lizzo, a pop singer and rapper who has made her plus-size central to her public persona. Wearing a yellow corset, Lizzo screamed empty-headed slogans, such as \u201cI feel good as hell,\u201d while chugging Tequila in front of a giant, inflatable ass. The unmusical display of vulgarity received a standing ovation, and garnered the critical superlatives \u201cempowering\u201d and \u201cepic.\u201d\n\nFrom Bessie Smith to Madonna, bawdy and ribald women have a long and proud tradition in American music. The massive inflatable ass prop, however, is emblematic for a culture suffocating under the flatulent weight of mediocrity and frivolity.\n\nVince Gill said in the final episode of \u201cCounty Music\u201d that all genres undergo changes. He would not enjoy country if it always remained the same. Altering tastes and trends create different styles of musical performance, and no one expects the contemporary charts to feature replicas of Jimmie Rodgers and Bob Wills. The inescapable question shouting out from Ken Burns\u2019 documentary is where are the modern equivalents of George Jones and Tammy Wynette? We got Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley.\n\nWhere is the new version of Willie Nelson, who after writing \u201cCrazy\u201d for Patsy Cline moved from Nashville to Austin rather than compromise on his own artistic ambition? We have country hitmakers penning songs for vodka and barbecue sauce ads and talking about \u201cknockin\u2019 boots.\u201d\n\nWhere, in the \u201cwoke\u201d era, is anyone resembling Johnny Cash, who made a deep study of Native American history, released a concept album about indigenous life over the objections of the Nashville machine, and then went to the White House, at the behest of Richard Nixon, and defiantly played a song paying tribute to the anti-war movement? We have Taylor Swift boasting that she is \u201cobsessed with politics,\u201d transforming citizenship into a social media boast as if everyone should collapse in awe.\n\nWhat has happened to country music itself? In my lifetime, it has transformed from Garth Brooks singing \u201cThe Dance,\u201d one of the most moving songs about loss ever recorded, and Kathy Mattea winning awards for \u201cWhere Have You Been,\u201d the song her husband wrote about his grandmother recognizing his grandfather after suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s, to an endlessly interchangeable series of \u201cbro country\u201d singers whose lyrics Vince Gill aptly summarized as \u201cI\u2019m hot. You\u2019re hot. We\u2019re drunk. We\u2019re in a truck.\u201d\n\nIt appears that America no longer has the infrastructure necessary to produce greatness, and when greatness does emerge, it wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it. Certainly it would be taken out the back door by security at any major, corporate record label\u2014they\u2019ve all decided what\u2019s best for the audience, and for their bottom lines.\n\nAnd so, the imagination stretches to painful, fantastical lengths in an attempt to contemplate the same audience shouting in adulation for Lizzo, buying records by someone with the heart and soul of Aretha Franklin or Maybelle Carter.\n\nKris Kristofferson, a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War and Rhodes Scholar, set a new lyrical standard in country music with his attempt to distill the essence of the romantic poets he studied into succinct and plainspoken country songs. It is hard to believe that many contemporary hitmakers have heard of William Blake, let alone read his poetry.\n\nThe influential songwriter and actor had a sense and appreciation of history, especially as it related to his craft. One of the consistent ideas of Burns\u2019 \u201cCountry Music\u201d is that marvelous music results from the tension between an adventurous spirit of experimentation, and adherence to tradition. Emmylou Harris, and the \u201cneo-traditionalists\u201d of the 1980s, reminded country audiences what originally made their music so magnificent, but without the rebellion of figures like Ernest Tubb and Waylon Jennings, the genre might have stagnated.\n\nPerhaps, one of the reasons why America no longer has great artists in the mainstream is because the progress and prosperity of our society has removed from most people\u2019s lives the hardship and struggle that were so elemental to the creation of country and the blues. Lack of suffering is a good problem to have, but subtracting from an already empty culture is a totalizing disavowal of history. Refusal to appreciate the artifacts of the past will make the art of the present rather trivial.\n\nWriters from several prominent publications condemned Dolly Parton because when prompted, she failed to aggressively condemn Donald Trump. If your assessment of the songwriter of \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d and \u201cCoat of Many Colors\u201d is that she is insufficiently supportive of the \u201cresistance\u201d than you should never again put words to paper, and consider exercising the same restraint about going out in public.\n\nThe Parton \u201ccontroversy\u201d was a minor episode in a new American pattern\u2014small people evaluating someone of enormous talent, strength, and authenticity.\n\nAndy Warhol believed that art should reflect the image of its society back on itself, whereas other artists, such as Walt Whitman, believed that art has the potential to transform society. Regardless of whether art is a mirror or mechanic \u2014it is often both\u2014the country music of America\u2019s past indicates that there was an audience eager for songs of depth and poetic sensitivity about the dreams and tears of farmers, housewives, prisoners, and ordinary people whose lives possessed none of the glamour that social media asserts as a measurement of human value.\n\nThe characters who currently populate American pop culture, and the audiences that applaud them, and the executives that produce them, expose a culture that is hollowed out of its humanity\u2014 tragically unable to distinguish between music that moves the spirit and the jingles that make disposable products seem more appealing on television. Worse yet, they don\u2019t even seem to care.\n\nTo quote the songwriters Buddy Cannon and Jamey Johnson, whose song Willie Nelson recorded to delightful effect as a duet with Merle Haggard:\n\nWell, it\u2019s all going to pot\n\nWhether we like it or not\n\nThe best I can tell\n\nThe world\u2019s gone to hell\n\nAnd we\u2019re sure gonna miss it a lot\n\nDavid Masciotra is the author of four books, including Mellencamp: American Troubadour (University Press of Kentucky) and Barack Obama: Invisible Man (Eyewear Publishing).", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/florida-georgia-line.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
