He quickly tweeted that Tesla has something in the works that would enable its cars to outdo even Porsche. It's called Plaid Mode.\n\nTesla TSLA Manycars already offer Ludicrous Mode, which is quicker than the previously available Insane Mode. Using Ludicrous Mode, a Tesla Model S can scurry from a dead stop to 60 miles an hour in less than 2.5 seconds.\n\nPlaid Mode will be faster than Ludicrous Mode and is expected to be available in about a year. It will use three electric motors rather than the two currently in vehicles equipped with Ludicrous, and will be available on Tesla's Model S, X and, later, in the Roadster, Musk has Tweeted.\n\nYes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production & applies to S,X & Roadster, but not 3 or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 12, 2019\n\nThe names Ludicrous Mode and Plaid Mode are taken from the movie Spaceballs, a 1987 parody of Star Wars directed by Mel Brooks. In Star Wars, when spaceships entered \"hyperspace\" and were traveling faster than the speed of light, the movie screen filled with streaks of smeared starlight. In Spaceballs, a spaceship could go so fast that the streaks of lights became plaid.\n\nPorsche set off Musk's recent spate of Plaid-related tweets by claiming the fastest lap ever by a four-door electric car on Germany's N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife. It's a famously challenging 13-mile racetrack on which automakers often test their cars and compare lap times for bragging rights. The Taycan covered it in seven minutes and 42 seconds\n\nRead More", "description": "When Porsche said it set a speed record with its new Taycan electric car, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, wasn't about to just sit there and take it.
