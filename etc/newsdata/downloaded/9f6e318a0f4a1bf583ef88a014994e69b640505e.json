But the company is already warning customers about another bug it hasn\u2019t gotten around to resolving just yet.\n\nAs detailed in this support article, Apple says that third-party keyboards installed on iOS 13 and iPadOS might be able to gain \u201cfull access\u201d even if you haven\u2019t authorized this. Keyboards with full access can send data to the internet, and that could potentially include whatever it is you\u2019re typing. TechCrunch first reported on the bug.\n\nApple plans to fix the bug \u201csoon\u201d in an upcoming software update. iOS 13.2 has already entered beta testing, so, presumably, the patch will be included whenever that is released to all iPhone customers.\n\nPopular third-party keyboards include Google\u2019s Gboard, the Microsoft-owned SwiftKey, and Grammarly. If you use one of them, it\u2019s fairly likely that you\u2019ve already granted full access, as these keyboards often request it to provide additional features. If that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s not much of anything to worry about here. But if you\u2019ve purposely avoided granting full access, you might want to temporarily delete third-party keyboards. And it should go without saying, but don\u2019t install alternate keyboards that you don\u2019t trust.\n\nCrucially, Apple prevents third-party developers from recording your passwords by always switching to the default iOS keyboard in password fields even when you\u2019re using something like Gboard for everything else.\n\nWith iOS 13 and iPadOS, Apple took another step in catching up to third-party keyboards by finally added a swipe method of inputting text. The company calls its take on this feature QuickPath.\n\nYou can check if you\u2019ve got any third-party keyboards installed by going to Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Edit.", "description": "Apple says that third-party keyboards installed on iOS 13.1 and iPadOS might be able to gain \"full access\" even if you haven\u2019t authorized this.
