He wasn\u2019t actually sick.", "language": "en", "text": "For much of his early childhood, 10-year-old Christopher Bowen was in and out of hospitals. He went to the doctor 323 times and had 13 major surgeries between 2009 and 2016, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He was fitted with a feeding tube, used an oxygen device and, sometimes, a wheelchair.\n\nBut Christopher didn\u2019t need any of it.\n\nAccording to a Child Protective Services complaint obtained by the Star-Telegram, his mother, Kaylene Bowen-Wright, subjected him to years of unnecessary invasive medical treatments in Dallas and Houston.\n\nOn Friday, Bowen-Wright was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to injury of a child, NBC Dallas Fort-Worth reported. Hospitals in Dallas and Houston had grown suspicious and filed reports with the state\u2019s child services agency. Child Protective Services removed Christopher and his two half-siblings from Bowen-Wright\u2019s custody in 2017 and closed its case last year.\n\n[Woman accused of fatally poisoning son in Munchausen case]\n\nFriday was the end of a long legal battle for Christopher\u2019s father, Ryan Crawford, who fought Bowen-Wright in court for years over custody and was long skeptical that his son was ill.\n\n\u201cShe was always saying Christopher was sick. Every single week. Every single month,\u201d Crawford told the Star-Telegram in December 2017, shortly after Bowen-Wright was arrested. \u201cShe would always say, \u2018Something\u2019s wrong. He has this. He has that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOver the years, Christopher\u2019s mother would claim he had cancer, a genetic disorder and seizures, among other ailments.\n\n[An Oklahoma mom raised $20K for her 4-year-old daughter. Then her story began to unravel.]\n\nBowen-Wright also created online fundraisers for Christopher, the Star-Telegram reported. She organized a bike rally for him in 2014, after claiming he had a rare disease called arteriovenous malformation, with the hope of raising $30,000 for medical treatments. In local coverage of that event, Bowen-Wright told CW 33 that \u201cChristopher has trouble breathing so basically, his lungs \u2014 and body \u2014 doesn\u2019t get the oxygen it needs, so he gets tired; he can\u2019t play as long as the normal kids,\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long Christopher will live with AVM.\u201d\n\nAt Bowen-Wright\u2019s trial this year, Suzanne Dakil of the Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas testified that Christopher often seemed healthier than his mother claimed and that the unnecessary treatments had actually caused medical complications, the NBC affiliate reported.\n\nCrawford now has full custody of his son, according to NBC.\n\nTexas media reported that Bowen-Wright\u2019s behavior was consistent with a condition known to medical professionals as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which one person falsifies another person\u2019s illness and seeks unnecessary treatments for it.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether Bowen-Wright had been diagnosed with the condition.\n\n\u201cThe moment I heard about this case a year and a half ago, it seemed like a particularly severe case of Munchausen by proxy, combined probably with what we called malingering by proxy,\u201d said Marc Feldman, a distinguished fellow at the American Psychiatric Association and an expert on the condition.\n\nFeldman said that in cases of Munchausen by proxy, \u201cthe mother is not only after attention and sympathy, but government benefits, disability support, medications. They may be after a whole host of tangible gains as well as the attention.\u201d\n\nThere is debate among the psychiatric community about whether the condition is a form of mental illness or a type of abuse, Feldman said, but children who are subjected to it can suffer serious consequences even if the behavior is discovered. Unnecessary medical treatments can do harm or endanger a child. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are not uncommon among survivors. An estimated 600 to 1,200 cases occur in the United States each year, according to Feldman.\n\nIt takes an average of 14 to 15 months for a case of Munchausen by proxy to be discovered, and America\u2019s decentralized medical system enables perpetrators to bounce from doctor to doctor to avoid suspicion and continue to fabricate stories and diagnoses with each new visit. It is unusual, though, for a parent to take a child to hundreds of different medical visits as Bowen-Wright had, Feldman said, though he added it was not unheard of.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve encountered cases that have gone on for seven, eight, nine years before doctors recognize that it was abuse,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA local reporter grilled Mike Pompeo about impeachment.
