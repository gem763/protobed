Ichiro has been serving as a special adviser to the team since early in the 2018 season, but came back to take the field for a final time in Tokyo.\n\nAfter playing the first of three games against the White Sox on Friday, the Mariners hosted Ichiro Fireworks Night. Then Saturday night, in addition to giving out Ichiro bobbleheads, the team staged a pregame ceremony in his honor \u2014 before the team walked off on an Omar Narvaez homer to win 2-1.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIchiro, who throughout his career did most of his public speaking in Japanese through a translator, addressed the crowd for five minutes in perfect English. Current team members and fellow franchise legends Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez stood behind him.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to Seattle in 2001, no position player had come from Japan before. The one you got was 27, small, skinny and unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had every reason not to accept me, however you welcomed me with open arms and never stopped even when I left and came back.\u201d\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve got a tissue handy for this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the night we celebrate one of the best to ever do it, Ichiro Suzuki addressed the crowd during the pregame ceremony. 5\ufe0f\u20e31\ufe0f\u20e3 pic.twitter.com/bhy3dfGHe9 \u2014 Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) September 15, 2019\n\nAll this from a man who has been (incorrectly) accused of refusing to learn English.\n\nStory continues\n\nIchiro continues to take the field, because of course he does\n\nEven in \u201cretirement,\u201d Ichiro is finding himself on the field plenty as an instructor. According to The New York Times, he\u2019s taken to the craft of throwing batting practice as meticulously as anything he famously did during his playing career.\n\nHe\u2019s also been spotted shagging balls in the outfield from time to time, including on Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s Ichiro Weekend.\n\n\n\nSo naturally, Ichiro is doing Ichiro things. pic.twitter.com/fy6N0JSCpx \u2014 Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) September 14, 2019\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t allowed in the dugout during games as an adviser last season, Ichiro passed time by throwing in the batting cages. He started throwing every day, up to 200 pitches, just imagining that some day he\u2019d be called upon to pitch in BP, which he eventually got to do.\n\nNow, he throws consistent, smooth strikes \u2013 and developed an arsenal of pitches \u2013 so some batters love to take BP off of him at home games.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a two-seamer, cutter, four-seam fastball up, a curveball, and a slider \u2014 and he can throw any of them for strikes,\u201d utility player Austin Nola said. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who was the best situational hitter of anybody I know, and he can throw all these pitches for strikes.\u201d\n\nWhen the team leaves town, Ichiro drives an hour to throw to the team\u2019s AAA-affiliate players in Tacoma, according to the Times.\n\nThere\u2019s even a rumor he had to \u201ctake a little off\u201d his throws because they were coming in too hot. We\u2019d expect nothing less.\n\nFormer Seattle Mariners player Ichiro Suzuki gave an emotional speech as part of the team's weekend festivities staged in his honor.
