Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Neither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d Congressman John Ratcliffe @foxandfriends Where is the Whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD!\n\nTrump had earlier repeated one of his most common protests, that investigations against him, whether the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry or the previous Trump-Russia investigation conducted by the special counsel Robert Mueller, add up to nothing more than a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.\n\nHe then added on Twitter on Wednesday morning that the fight to regain the majority in the House of Representatives for the Republicans in the 2020 election \u2013 after losing control in the 2018 midterm elections \u2013 is on.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country!\n\nOn Tuesday, in 10 hours of testimony behind closed doors, Taylor provided congressional committees conducting impeachment hearings a detailed account of how Trump repeatedly sought to make a summit meeting for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at the White House and a military aid package to Ukraine conditional on Zelenskiy launching investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents.\n\nPlay Video 5:26 Could Donald Trump actually be impeached? \u2013 video\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony was the latest in a series of depositions by serving and former administration officials, as part of the impeachment inquiry, about Trump\u2019s use of the presidency to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to procure compromising information on his political rivals. And it was the most detailed and damning to date.\n\nThe veteran diplomat said that soon after arriving in Kyiv, he became concerned \u201cour relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of US policymaking, and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons\u201d.\n\nTaylor said this irregular channel was run by Trump through several emissaries: his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani\u2018; the departing energy secretary, Rick Perry; the ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland; and the special Ukraine envoy, Kurt Volker.\n\nThey became focused solely on persuading Zelenskiy to announce investigations that would damage Democrats and especially Biden, the former vice-president and a leading contender to the be the 2020 Democratic nominee.\n\nDemocrats declared it to be the clearest account to date of Trump\u2019s abuse of office in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nThe White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, issued a statement late Tuesday denouncing the congressional hearings as \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the constitution\u201d.\n\nAccording to Taylor\u2019s statement, published by the Lawfare website, Sondland made clear that both aid and a White House summit were conditional on the launch of two investigations.\n\nOne into a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, which had employed Biden\u2019s son Hunter. The second was into Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election, a reference to a conspiracy theory that \u2013 counter to the consensus view of US intelligence agencies - held that it was Ukraine that had interfered in the vote in the Democrats\u2019 favour, rather than Russia in favour of Trump.", "description": "President attempted to discredit Ukraine diplomat with quote from John Ratcliffe: \u2018You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo\u2019", "authors": ["Joanna Walters", "Julian Borger", "Richard Wolffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961ed862e96e72042f4e973e71aad02a1a4b8877/0_111_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d39b013dfe7dea6b14f780081d71d2a0", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
