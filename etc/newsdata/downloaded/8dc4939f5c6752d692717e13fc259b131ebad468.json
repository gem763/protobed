This transition has asserted its dominance of the streaming sector. And along with that dominance, the streaming giant has started to seriously monetize its platform in a variety of ways.\n\nThe best part is that this could just be the beginning for Roku.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith its continued fast pace of user adoption and several new big streaming services coming down the pike, Roku should be able to keep these new sources of revenue humming alone. And that will be music to investor\u2019s ears. Yes, shares of ROKU have surged. But the streaming kingpin can keep its shares rising far into the future. That makes it a big-time buy even at today\u2019s levels.\n\nROKU Stock and Platform Dominance\n\nOne of the biggest stories right now happens to be Disney (NYSE:DIS) and the launch of its Disney+ service. But here\u2019s the real question? How are you going to access it and get the Star Wars or Hanna Montana content your tween is going crazy for? The answer quickly is becoming Roku.\n\nThe key for Roku is that its devices and now the embedded platform on many televisions. The key is that it\u2019s open-source. Everyone\u2019s apps and channels work well on the devices and OS. For consumers cutting the cord, Roku has been a blessing. Consumers can watch Hulu, their Disney+ and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscriptions all from the same device.\n\nIn fact, Roku hosts more than 5,000 third-party streaming applications. That\u2019s made Roku the standard streaming platform. And with active accounts now numbering 30.5 million or about 39% of all streaming households, every streaming service wants to be part of the action.\n\nThat\u2019s put Roku in a very enviable position. It\u2019s the gatekeeper. And the gatekeeper gets to make the rules. In this case, charging streaming networks a 20% to 30% revenue share fee for access to its platform. No wonder why Roku saw its total revenues surge by 59% year-over-year in its latest reported quarter.\n\nBut even those great results don\u2019t tell the whole picture. Digging in deeper and you can see why ROKU stock still has plenty of gas left in the streaming tank.\n\nPlatform Revenue and Roku Stock\n\nAs we said, Roku makes most of its money via its platform- about 65% of its total revenues- versus device sales. Lately, the firm has made some serious moves to monetize that further. That has it becoming the next biggest advertising play.\n\nThis includes its propriety Roku Channel, which serves as a hub for many shows and movies as well as ads on its homepage/start-up screen. The firm gets a slice of advertising revenue for those non-subscription streaming services such as Cheddar and Crackle that use its platform as well. Here, Roku places ads for the services.\n\nHeck, it even makes a hefty penny by selling the space on its device remotes for dedicated buttons that send viewers directly to a channel.\n\nWith the number of active viewers continuing to rise, Roku is pulling in a lot of user data, and it is starting to massage that cache of data in a big way. Every time we click on a movie, watch a show, engage with an ad, Roku starts to build a profile; just like Facebook (NYSE:FB) does on the web. The Roku Audience Marketplace allows marketers to tap into this trove of data in real-time.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that marketers are pulling their ad spend away from more traditional means and placing them on the web and in mobile channels. Unlike traditional cable television upon which advertisers simply buy time during popular shows, streaming can be customized. They want to target specific consumers that are more likely to buy or use a specific product or service. Given the sheer amount of data that Roku users make, it\u2019s a virtual goldmine.", "description": "There's no denying that Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has been a beast over the last year.
