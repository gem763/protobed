At CES 2019, Intel demonstrated its facial recognition technology in the Hoobox Robotics\u2019 Wheelie 7 kit. The kit can be retrofitted to existing motorized chairs to give the rider control using only their facial expressions. The Intel-powered Wheelie 7 kit relies on several of the firm's technologies, including a 3D Intel RealSense Depth Camera SR300, Intel Core processors, and the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit. Users can pick from 10 facial expressions to control a motorized wheelchair, with gestures such as 'kiss' or 'full smile' able to stop, start, or turn the chair. Intel\u2019s new AI facial recognition kit could revolutionize mobility for wheelchair users\n\nAs the kit is still in the prototype phase, Intel has not yet revealed how much it will cost.\n\n\u2018The Wheelie 7 is the first product to use facial expressions to control a wheelchair,\u2019 said Dr Paulo Pinheiro, co-founder and CEO of HOOBOX Robotics in December.\n\n\u2018This requires incredible precision and accuracy, and it would not be possible without Intel technology.\n\n\u2018We are helping people regain their autonomy.\u2019\n\n\n\n", "description": "At CES, Intel demonstrated its tech in the Hoobox Robotics\u2019 Wheelie 7 kit, which can be retrofitted to existing motorized chairs to give the rider control using only their facial expressions.", "authors": ["Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.Com In Las Vegas"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/09/06/8300390-0-image-a-82_1547015228346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-09"}
