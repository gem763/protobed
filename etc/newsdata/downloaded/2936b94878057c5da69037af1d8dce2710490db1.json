What kind of comments hurt individuals' dignity and personal lives, rather than simply express an opinion. This not only applies to celebrities but to other sensitive issues such as politics.\"Daum Kakao says it will continue to revise its policies to scrap users' comments and autofill suggestions that could provoke hate speech and violate the dignity of individuals.Oh Soo-young, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
