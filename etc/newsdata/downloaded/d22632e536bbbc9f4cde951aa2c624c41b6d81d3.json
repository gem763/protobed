The tool would automatically report employees who create a calendar event with more than 10 rooms or 100 participants according to a memo written by a Google employee.\n\nThe employee alleged in the memo that the most likely explanation for this tool \u201cis that this is an attempt of leadership to immediately learn about any workers organization attempts.\u201d A Google spokesperson told Bloomberg: \u201cThese claims about the operation and purpose of this extension are categorically false. This is a pop-up reminder that asks people to be mindful before auto-adding a meeting to the calendars of large numbers of employees.\u201d\n\nGoogle alleges that the development of the extension was prompted by an increase in spam related to calendars and events and doesn\u2019t collect any personally identifiable information or stop the use of calendars. Tensions surrounding protests and worker-organized events have been rising for some time now.\n\nGoogle\u2019s office in Zurich held an event earlier this month related to workers\u2019 rights and unionization, despite attempts by managers to cancel the event. Over the last 18 months, employees have protested how Google leadership has handled issues such as sexual harassment complaints and launched internal campaigns to end Google projects such as the censored Chinese search engine known as Project Dragonfly.\n\nEmployees internally have mocked the new Google tracking tool on message boards, with one employee posting a meme which featured an image of a group of men in suits laughing, with a caption stating: \u201cAnd then we told them, \u2018WE WILL NOT make it appear to you that we are watching out for your protected concerted activities\u2019 as we pushed a Chrome extension to report when someone makes a meeting with 100+ people.\u201d\n\nAnother meme featured the Harry Potter character Professor Dolores Umbridge, who in the series had a number of ridiculous rules and regulations designed to shut down any dissent. The text on the meme reads: \u201cGoogle decree number 24: no employee organization or meeting with over 100 participants may exist without the knowledge and approval of the high inquisitor.\u201d\n\nRead more at Bloomberg here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
