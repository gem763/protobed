This entire time, the aid was getting released. It was going to get released. And guess what happened. The aid got released. And you know what didn\u2019t have to happen? There was no new investigation that had to get created. This whole thing is a fairytale.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff is misleading you and you\u2019re playing along with it, many of you are, and the American public is being deceived,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "While speaking with reporters alongside some of his colleagues at a House Republican press conference on Tuesday, Rep.
