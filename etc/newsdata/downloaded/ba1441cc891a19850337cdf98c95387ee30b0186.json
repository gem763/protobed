Jacquerious Mitchell, who was wounded during the incident and treated at Parkland Hospital, allegedly told authorities that Green fatally shot \u201cBrown twice before taking his backpack and gun.\u201d After dropping Mitchell off at the hospital, the two other suspects fled the state, authorities said.\n\nSeveral witnesses told authorities they saw a silver, four-door sedan fleeing the parking lot at a high speed after the Friday night shooting at an apartment building about four miles from the South Side Flats complex. Brown was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, but he died from his injuries.\n\nAuthorities said about \u201c12 pounds of marijuana, 149 grams of THC cartridges, and $4,157\u201d was seized from Brown\u2019s apartment during an initial search.\n\nAll three men will be charged with capital murder, Moore said Tuesday, before calling claims that Brown\u2019s death was connected to the trial or the police department \u201csimply untrue.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Lee Merritt, a civil-rights attorney who represents both the Jean and Brown families, said Brown had repeatedly expressed to prosecutors his apprehension about testifying against Guyger\u2014a move he believed would put his life at risk. He alleged Brown was so afraid to testify that he fled to California the same day the convicted cop\u2019s murder trial began.\n\nMerritt said Monday that Brown, a roofing and property contractor, had previously survived a shooting near a Dallas strip club last November and didn\u2019t want to testify in Jean\u2019s trial out of fear of retribution. Brown even moved out of the apartment complex where Guyger and Jean lived about three months after Jean\u2019s death to keep a \u201clow profile.\u201d\n\n\u201cJosh was concerned that these people still meant him harm, so when he was subpoenaed to testify against Amber Guyger he was conflicted,\u201d Merritt wrote on Facebook Tuesday. \u201cHe wanted to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe attorney alleged prosecutors pressured Brown into testifying, telling him that he was a key witness in Guyger\u2019s trial and would help \u201cto ensure a conviction.\u201d Brown fled the state for California the day the trial began, Merritt said. He returned only after prosecutors \u201chounded him\u201d and threatened to issue an arrest warrant if he didn\u2019t come back to appear in court, the lawyer explained.\n\nWearing a Dragon-Ball Z shirt on the stand, Brown told jurors that on the night of Sept. 6, 2018, he was in the fourth-floor hallway of the apartment building when he heard what he thought sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise.\u201d\n\nBrown, who lived across from Jean, said he couldn\u2019t hear what was said before two shots were fired.\n\nGuyger was found guilty of murder last week for fatally shooting Jean, an unarmed black man who was sitting on his couch eating vanilla ice cream when the white off-duty cop in uniform entered his apartment. During the trial, Guyger testified she confused Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and believed he was an intruder, shooting at him in self-defense.\n\n\u201cI thought it was my apartment,\u201d Guyger told dispatchers 19 times on the 911 call played in court. \u201cI thought it was my apartment. I\u2019m fucked. Oh my God. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nGuyger, 31, was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week after an emotional two-day hearing that prompted both Jean\u2019s younger brother and the trial judge, Tammy Kemp, to hug the former cop.\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "Dallas police said Tuesday that Joshua Brown\u2019s death was not at all related to his testimony at the convicted cop\u2019s murder trial.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3611,w_6421,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570554201/RTX75TWY_uux4wr", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
