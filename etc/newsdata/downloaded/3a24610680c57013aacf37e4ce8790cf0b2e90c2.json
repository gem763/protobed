McMaster stressed Thursday in Washington that the United States would be insane if it did.McMaster, who worked for U.S. President Donald Trump from February 2017 to April 2018, said at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that Washington should not repeat the mistakes of past administrations by offering premature sanctions relief.\u201cThat\u2019s the definition of insanity if we do that again,\u201d he said.When the North carries out its \u201cprovocation cycle,\u201d that\u2019s when the United States should be sure it doesn\u2019t lift sanctions without any meaningful progress in denuclearization, he said.\u201cLong drawn-out negotiations,\u201d McMaster said, \u201cduring which the North Koreans try to extort more money and payoffs from us. And then ultimately what do you get? You get a weak agreement that locks in the status quo as the new normal.\u201dAnd, McMaster highlighted, \u201cNorth Korea breaks that agreement right away.\u201dBY LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
