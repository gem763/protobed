When asked if he\u2019d share a ticket with former Vice President Joe Biden, the businessman said he\u2019s \u201cdefinitely open to working with Joe\u201d and that they\u2019ve talked about it.\n\nThe 44-year-old entrepreneur has succeeded in building a strong following, as evidenced by the $10 million his campaign raised in the third quarter.\n\nYang\u2019s proposal for a universal basic income \u2014 his \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d that would give $1,000 a month to every American over the age of 18 \u2014 has piqued many voters\u2019 interest.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, a lot of the solutions politicians have been offering will not improve people\u2019s lives nearly as much as $1,000 a month, because if you get $1,000 a month, you can do any of a range of things with it,\u201d Yang told the audience, adding that Americans will be able to opt in to the plan. \u201cBut you know how to solve your own problems the best.\u201d\n\nYang also showed little enthusiasm for a wealth tax on billionaires, which Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have both openly embraced and have been criticized for.\n\n\u201cI am not conceptually against a wealth tax or an asset tax,\u201d Yang said. \u201cI consider myself a very fact- and data-driven person ... I certainly don\u2019t want to walk us down the road that other countries have walked down and learned hard lessons from.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out, but it\u2019s not, to me, the first and best choice,\u201d he continued, when asked if he\u2019d support an asset tax. \u201cWe have to look at what has worked around the world.\u201d", "description": "The businessman and former lawyer said he would \"100%\" support whoever the nominee is.", "authors": ["Front Page Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae4dd5200000881c50659b.jpeg?cache=ww9dvdb2iq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
