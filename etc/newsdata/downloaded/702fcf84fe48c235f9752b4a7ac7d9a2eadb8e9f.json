She was seen by the resort doctor who diagnosed her with diarrhoea, nausea and viral acute colitis.\n\nDr Bux was instructed by AMS Solicitors to prepare a medical report. Dr Bux, in considering the diagnosis, undertook a telephone consultation with the ill holidaymaker and diagnosed infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which he concluded was due to inadequate food preparation and food handling at the hotel.\n\nKaren Smith, Operations Manager for Beachcomber Tours, handled this claim and had concerns that Dr Bux's diagnosis differed from that of the doctor at the resort.\n\nShe also discovered that Dr Bux's wife was a Partner at AMS Solicitors.\n\nDr Bux was found to be at fault for failing to disclose his solicitor wife Sehana (right) was a director for AMS, the solicitors firm which had commissioned him to act as a medical witness in county court claims (left: Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester)\n\nFurther cases involved one claim in Fuerteventura where a patient suffered a rash in November 2015 and was treated in hospital on the island.\n\nIn his report dated 26 July 2016, Dr Bux diagnosed the patient with an anaphylactic reaction secondary to infective gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning.\n\nA couple went on holiday to Benidorm in June 2015, and both complained of falling ill with food poisoning and both made a claim against TUI.\n\nDr Bux produced reports dated 24 August 2016 and 25 August 2016 diagnosing both with infective gastroenteritis as a result of food poisoning which was caused by inadequate food preparation and handling, although he only spoke to them on the telephone.\n\nAllegations were found proven in each of the holiday cases, with Dr Bux failing to declare his personal relationship with his wife at AMS and diagnosing food poisoning without sufficient evidence.\n\nTribunal chairman Julia Oakford said as Dr Bux's wife was a salaried partner at AMS, managing the litigation department, it was difficult to conclude she would have no knowledge or sight of the claims.\n\nThe panel also ruled the doctor's actions were misleading, dishonest and financially motivated.\n\nShe added: 'The tribunal found that Dr Bux diagnosed food poisoning alone as it was in his interest to write a positive report to enable him to sustain this stream of work.'\n\nExpert witness Nigel Zoltie also criticised Dr Bux for circumcising the 15-month-old, referred to as Patient A, in a community setting.\n\nHe said: 'It remains my opinion that all actions were likely to put Patient A at high risk of life-threatening complications that could only managed with great difficulty in the community.\n\n'For a religious procedure these risks were unacceptable, and therefore the care was seriously below standard.'", "description": "Dr Zuber Bux, from Blackburn, did not tell holiday companies or the courts that his wife Sehana (pictured) worked for AMS, the law firm that instructed him.", "authors": ["Henry Martin For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19796300-0-image-a-2_1571242265068.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
