In other words, a former self will be given the power to order their current self dispatched \u2014 even, presumably, if the current self is not suffering and may not want to die.\n\nWe can tell which way that debate is going with the Alzheimer\u2019s Society Canada endorsing such a legal change. From the Society\u2019s press release:\n\nPeople living with dementia are individuals \u2014 first and foremost. They have the same rights as everyone else, including the right to participate in decisions about their life and care. We respect the right of all persons with dementia to advocate for their individual best interests, including advocating for MAID [medical assistance in dying, e.g., lethal injection] through advance requests.\n\nSo, in Canada, helpless people with dementia are about to become a killable caste with the cooperation of an organization that supposedly advocates for their welfare.\n\nAnd if incompetent patients, then why not also allow the killing of sick children? Oh yeah, that\u2019s coming too \u2014 perhaps without requiring parental consent.", "description": "A former self will be given the power to order their current self dispatched even, presumably, if the current self is not suffering and may not want to die.", "authors": ["Wesley J.
