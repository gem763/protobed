Netflix will have to contend with several new entrants in the streaming space in coming months\n\nAfter a year, though, all bets will be off, with Apple facing the same need for fresh shows to make subscribers pay, which drove Netflix to sink a reported $12 billion into new programming last year.\n\nAnalysts say the crowded field will change the nature of a business where the relatively limited number of services meant users rarely had to choose.\n\nWhereas Netflix in the past took content from a wide range of studios and networks, now many of them will have their own streaming services and keep franchises like, for example, Disney's Marvel cinematic universe, to themselves.\n\nLaunching on November 1 in 100 countries, Apple TV+ promises to launch a new show every week and has already announced drama 'See' starring Jason Momoa, 'The Morning Show,' with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and 'Helpsters,' a children's series from the makers of 'Sesame Street.'", "description": "Disney, which owns ABC and cable channel Freeform, banned Netflix from running ads as it prepares to launch new video streaming service Disney+ on November 12, sources said.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19311598-0-image-a-2_1570216404610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
