The midfielder remains sidelined by a foot problem, having spent time in Dubai during the international break to try to regain fitness.\n\nThere was also no sign of De Dea after the goalkeeper made a surprise start in the draw with Liverpool.\n\nDe Gea suffered an injury scare while on international duty with Spain earlier this month, appearing to hurt his hamstring in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Sweden, but was able to play in Sunday's 1-1 draw.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut it appears the Spanish stopper will be rested for the European clash and was therefore not required to take part in the session on Wednesday.\n\nThere was also no sign of Luke Shaw or Nemanja Matic, along with injured defenders Axel Tuanzebe, Diogo Dalot, Eric Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah.\n\nSolskjaer is yet to confirm his travelling squad for the clash.\n\nMarcus Rashford, meanwhile, is hoping to see more of a swagger and cutting edge from United - after his first-half strike was cancelled out by Adam Lallana's late equaliser for Liverpool.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"The second goal would have made the game a lot more simple for us,\" the England international said.\n\n\"It didn't come. I'd say 20 minutes before they scored the goal you can see we stopped playing passes in behind, and I always say when we stop doing that it puts more pressure on us as a team.\"\n\nRashford added: \"This club, we play attacking football and as soon as we take our foot off the gas a little bit it's difficult to defend against top players for large spells like we had to towards the end of the game.\n\n\"So, I think we've just got to be more positive - at 1-0 or 2-0 up, we need to be more positive.\"", "description": "Manchester United head to Serbia to take on Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20705611.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Europa-League-Manchester-United-Training.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
