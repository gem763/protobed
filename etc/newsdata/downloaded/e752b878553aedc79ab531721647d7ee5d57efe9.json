An accommodative Federal Reserve and recent corporate tax cuts have helped pushed this rally even further.\n\nWith all the hype around the US stock market, it feels odd that this region's 1 year return is basically flat. This of course after we've seen the big sell-off during December 2018, while the recent trade war talks between the US and China have also added to volatility.\n\nMSCI USA\n\nAnd how does the rest of the world compare?\n\nIt turns out not very well, especially Emerging Markets. The chart below shows the 12 month returns of the US (in blue), Developed Markets ex-US (in green) and Emerging Markets (in red).\n\nEmerging Markets got spared during the sharp December 2018 sell-off, but trade war fears are weighing heavily on this region.\n\nMSCI Regions\n\nThis flows chart explains it really well, as trade tensions heightened during August, investors dumped their Emerging Markets holdings, recording the largest monthly outflow since November 2016.\n\nSource: IIF Twitter Account (@IIF)\n\nThe one part of Emerging Markets that investors still seem to adore is their debt. With negative yielding bonds in most of Europe and also Japan, investors have been rushing to Emerging Markets for yield. The Emerging Market bond index is at a 19 month high.\n\niShares JPM EMB\n\nIt's not just Emerging Market bonds offering superior yields, it's also Emerging Market equities (but as we've seen, investors aren't buying into this just yet).\n\nSource: Topdown Charts Twitter account (@topdowncharts))\n\nRecord low yields, an accommodative Federal Reserve and trade war talks have been very beneficial for gold.\n\nGold Futures\n\nIn fact, there has been a really strong relationship between gold and negative yielding debt.\n\nSource: IIF Twitter account (@IIF))\n\nAs it stands, the outcome of the trade war talks and the future \"accommodativeness\" of the Fed will likely dictate market movements in the short-term.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Johann Biermann covering: .
