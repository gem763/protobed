It\u2019s unclear why discussions for that site fell through. WeWork, the SoftBank-backed startup, has been reeling since it shelved an initial public offering and is seeking rescue financing before it runs out of cash as early as next month.\n\nRepresentatives for Google, WeWork and IWG, the world\u2019s biggest co-working provider, declined to comment.\n\nThe deal marks another loss for WeWork as the company struggles to find its footing after the abandoned IPO. The firm has been selling off stakes in investments, planning far-reaching job cuts and reining in expenses. It recently scrapped a project in Seattle.\n\nCo-Working Rivals\n\nIn the midst of WeWork\u2019s turmoil, the company\u2019s rivals \u2014 such as IWG, Industrious and Convene \u2014 are racing to capture a larger market share, pitching themselves to tenants and landlords as more stable providers of flexible office space.\n\n\u201cYou have to separate the issues at WeWork from the co-working business model,\u201d Tamara Lawson, chief financial officer at QuadReal Property Group Ltd., said Wednesday at the Bloomberg Canada Fixed Income Conference in New York.\n\nLawson said QuadReal doesn\u2019t have any business with WeWork, but the firm does invest in some of its rivals, including Convene.\n\nGoogle has been expanding in Toronto and was negotiating in June to rent space at an upcoming office development downtown, Bloomberg reported at the time. The city\u2019s downtown office market ranks among the tightest in North America, thanks to growing financial-services and tech companies and a shortage of space.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Another loss for WeWork as the company struggles to find its footing after the abandoned IPO", "authors": ["Natalie Wong", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/wework-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
