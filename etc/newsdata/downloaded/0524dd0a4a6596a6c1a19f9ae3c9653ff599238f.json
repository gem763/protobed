The top two teams qualify for Euro 2020.\n\nItaly\u2019s run, which includes a friendly win over the United States followed by their eight Euro qualifiers, is their longest since 1938-39 under Vittorio Pozzo.\n\n\u201cAm I interested in equalling Pozzo\u2019s record? I would be interested in winning two World Cups and an Olympic Games like he did, but a European Championship would do just fine,\u201d said Italy coach Roberto Mancini.\n\nMancini made 10 changes to the side which beat Greece on Saturday to clinch qualification, and gave a debut to Giovanni Di Lorenzo.\n\nLiechtenstein nearly stunned the visitors after 40 seconds when Dennis Salanovic forced Salvatore Sirigu to save with his legs but, from the resulting corner, the hosts broke down the other end of the field and Federico Bernardeschi put them ahead.\n\nItaly struggled to build on the early breakthrough and Sirigu had to make another difficult save from Salanovic\u2019s curling shot just after the hour before the floodgates finally opened.\n\nAndrea Belotti headed in from a corner in the 70th minute and, seven minutes later, Alessio Romangnoli headed in his first Italy goal from Stephan El Shaarawy\u2019s cross. El Shaarawy, with a breakaway goal, and Belotti, with another header, rounded off the win.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that all the lads are really involved,\u201d said Mancini, who has rejuvenated the team during his 18 months in charge. \u201cAnd the truth is that, on June 1, I will be forced to make some important choices and some kids will have to miss out.\u201d\n\nFredrik Jensen gave Finland a halftime lead against Armenia before Pukki scored two nearly identical goals in the second half.\n\nJoel Pohjanpalo threaded a fine pass into the path of Pukki who clipped his finish over Armenia goalkeeper Aram Airapetyan in the 61st minute and the Norwich City forward repeated the trick in the 88th minute, this time from a Rasmus Schueller pass.\n\nBosnia were condemned to a 2-1 defeat in Greece when Adnan Kovacevic turned a Ioannis Fetfatzidis cross into his own net two minutes from time. Greece had gone ahead through Evangelos Pavlidis on the half hour with Amer Gojak equalising for Bosnia five minutes later.", "description": "Italy, already qualified for Euro 2020, maintained their perfect record in Group J and clocked up a record-equalling ninth international win in a row with a 5-0 thumping of Liechtenstein on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441245866&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1WY", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
