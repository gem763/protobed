And while Harry and Meghan may have no control over when the papers were filed in the High Court, the timing is intriguing.\n\nComing at the end of a successful tour of Africa, given acres of column inches despite the political crises at home, royal observers have been left asking themselves: why now?\n\nThe Sussexes have seemed at ease with the media lately, giving Q &As on camera while Harry has teamed up with the likes of National Geographic and even written a personal article in The Daily Telegraph. Yet the very publications that championed their charitable endeavours now stand accused of hypocrisy and the couple face accusations of double standards for wanting the tap of publicity turned on when it suits them, only to turn it off when the narrative turns negative.\n\nWhile there is no doubt Meghan has been criticised in both mainstream and social media - some of it nasty and unwarranted - the press did not \"fabricate\" the \u00a32.4 million ($4.4 million) of public money spent on Frogmore Cottage or the four private jet flights the couple took in less than two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNor did it \"misrepresent\" the fact that a number of employees left their household in swift succession. Perhaps these stories are not part of the \"relentless propaganda\" Harry refers to as being knowingly false and malicious. It is hard to tell since his statement suggests \"the British tabloid press\" are to blame, before referring to \"select outlets\" and then \"a specific press pack\".\n\nWhich may go some way to explain why a royal insider last night told this newspaper: \"Harry doesn't get journalists or journalism full stop.\" Though the statement insists the couple believe in \"media freedom and objective, truthful reporting,\" the source added: \"He doesn't want a free press. He'd rather there was no press or the palace controlled it completely.\"\n\nThe obvious explanation for this can be found in Harry's final assertion: \"I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces\" - suggesting the Duke still blames the press for the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nAfrica is 'where I can be myself'\n\nSome will question the wisdom of comparing Diana's death at the hands of a drunk driver being pursued by paparazzi to unfavourable headlines.\n\nPerhaps it is no coincidence that this outburst has come as Harry starts work on a series about mental health for Apple + TV, which no doubt will require him once again to confront an unbearable burden of grief and loss. Having his own child will also have prompted him to reflect on his own childhood. In this, he has the world's sympathy.\n\nBut it seems odd to condemn a post-Leveson media that has never been more respectful of royal privacy and largely leaves the Sussexes free to enjoy the trappings of their hugely privileged lives. And in this digital era, never has there been more scrutiny and sanction when the press gets things wrong - apologies, corrections and compensation payouts are there, online, for all eternity.\n\nHarry once said that if he wasn't a prince, he would gladly emigrate to Africa, describing it as \"the only place on earth where I can be myself.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving just spent 10 days there, could this be a sign they are contemplating upping sticks to somewhere they will receive less critical coverage?\n\nNow sixth in line to the throne, Harry and his American wife arguably have the freedom to go abroad and no one would blame them for wanting to show Archie Meghan's native California.\n\nBut as they seek a wider global profile, the Sussexes would be wise to remember that there is nothing more exposing than taking an ever more prominent place on the world's stage.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "What would the Queen think of  Prince Harry's suggestion that a \"ruthless campaign\" is being waged by the British tabloids to \"vilify\" his wife?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2421%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_7/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/866dc0e2ad45a6b5c0df3392f08ecdd97684551d", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
