Police would carry out DNA tests in a bid to establish the identity of the father, he was told.\n\nHe analysed evidence at a hearing in the court of protection, where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions, in London on Friday.\n\nBosses at an NHS hospital trust asked him to allow doctors to perform a surgical termination.\n\nA lawyer representing the trust said the woman had lived with foster carers for most of her life.\n\nThe barrister Eloise Power said the woman\u2019s foster parents were sure that an abortion was in her best interests.\n\nPower said medical specialists and council social workers involved also all agreed that a surgical termination was the right option.\n\nWilliams said medics could restrain the woman in order to administer a general anaesthetic if necessary. He said the woman, who lives in the north of England, could not be identified in media reports.\n\nHe also said the names of the hospital and council involved could not be revealed in case that information helped identify the woman.\n\nWilliams said authorising the termination of a pregnancy was a \u201csignificant interference\u201d in a woman\u2019s autonomy.\n\nBut he said the woman\u2019s best interests were the \u201clodestar\u201d of his decision, and evidence showed that allowing the pregnancy to continue would harm her. Evidence showed that the pregnancy was already affecting the woman\u2019s mental health and causing her to behave in a \u201csomewhat more aggressive fashion\u201d.\n\nShe would have to go for intrusive medical examinations if the pregnancy continued and would not be able to care for a child. He said more than 30 professionals had been involved in the case and all thought termination was the right option.", "description": "Doctors allowed to perform termination on woman with mental age of toddler", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcee04121c113e4538ae0464216e0fe452bca100/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=695f76172fdb4bdcfeec150636c7a34d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
