REUTERS/Baz Ratner\n\nThe medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said its efforts to get more people to be given the vaccine - developed by the U.S. drugmaker Merck and being used in emergency plans in the Congo epidemic - were being frustrated by \u201ctight controls on supply and eligibility criteria imposed by the WHO\u201d.\n\n\u201cTime is of essence in an outbreak: medical teams should be able to rapidly provide treatments or vaccines based on what they see on the ground,\u201d MSF\u2019s emergency coordinator Natalie Roberts said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBut our capacity... is severely undermined by a rigid system which is hard to comprehend.\u201d\n\nThe WHO denied it was rationing the vaccine and said it was working as hard as any organization to end Congo\u2019s deadly Ebola outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe partner closely with the DRC government to reach as many communities and individuals in the outbreak area as possible and are not limiting access to vaccine,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people since the middle of last year, second only to the 2013-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.\n\nThe WHO and the Congolese health ministry say that since August 2018, more than 223,000 people have been vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV, the Merck vaccine that has been shown in clinical trials to be highly protective against Ebola infection.\n\nCongo health authorities also gave the go-ahead on Saturday for plans to introduce a second Ebola vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, to help fight the outbreak.\n\nThe Merck shot is being deployed in a strategy known as \u201cring vaccination\u201d, which aims to control Ebola by identifying and offering the vaccine to contacts of those likely to be infected.\n\nThe WHO said that because Ebola spreads via person-to-person contact, this is \u201cthe most effective means of stopping\u201d its spread, but MSF\u2019s Roberts likened the situation to \u201cgiving firefighters a bucket of water to put out a fire, but only allowing them to use one cup of water a day\u201d.\n\nThe WHO said the Merck vaccine eligibility and strategy were recommended by independent specialists in agreement with Congo.\n\nThe plan with addition of the J&J vaccine, it said, is to extend protection by providing it to \u201ctargeted at-risk populations\u201d in areas where the disease is not yet being actively transmitted.", "description": "A rigid system of eligibility set by the World Health Organization means far too few people at risk of Ebola are being vaccinated in an outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo, the aid group MSF said on Monday.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433047055&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1RC", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
