Daryl Morey couldn\u2019t agree more, I\u2019m sure.\n\nI had forgotten but it turns out that the 2018 version of LeBron James was quite the woke gentleman:\n\n-Injustice Anywhere Is A Threat To Justice Everywhere- Our Lives Begin To End The Day We Become Silent About Things That Matter- #ThankYouMLK50 \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) January 15, 2018\n\n\u201cOur lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\u201d Whereas LeBron 2019 sounds like a ChiCom apparatchik mumbling about how critics like Morey need to be better \u201ceducated\u201d about what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong.\n\nI\u2019m honestly speechless. Hong Kongers, however, are not:\n\nThe online platform LIHKG, the forum favored by Hong Kong\u2019s protestors, was awash with criticism and handwringing Tuesday. \u201cHas he been brainwashed by the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s fake news or has he been bought?\u201d wrote one user. \u201cI really cannot believe that someone from the U.S. would not cherish the precious freedom of speech they have,\u201d added another. Said one user on LIHKG: \u201cMartin Luther King Jr. fought for civil rights, but LeBron James supports totalitarianism?\u201d\u2026 \u201cImagine the \u2018difficult weeks\u2019 protestors in Hong Kong have gone through,\u201d fired back one LIHKG user, referencing the Hong Kong police force\u2019s brutal suppression of the city\u2019s originally peaceful protest movement.\n\nHe\u2019s been bought. His domestic activism carries no risk of financial repercussions whereas activism that would irritate the Chinese government does. You\u2019re left to wonder what James would say if the NFL\u2019s accountant proved to him that social-justice protests during the national anthem really were hurting the league\u2019s bottom line (which is quite plausible). If the imperative to speak out about \u201cthings that matter\u201d ends the moment it costs you a buck to do so then LeBron should agree that those protests needed to be suppressed, irrespective of the justness of their cause.\n\nDon\u2019t look to mega-millionaire American sports stars for moral clarity on human rights and freedom of speech for oppressed people abroad. Look to a guy with actual skin in the game, who reacted to LeBron\u2019s Chinese apologias in real time last night:\n\nWow dude! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nSMH \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\n\ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\n-Haven\u2019t seen or talked to my family 5 years\n\n-Jailed my dad\n\n-My siblings can\u2019t find jobs\n\n-Revoked my passport\n\n-International arrest warrant\n\n-My family can\u2019t leave the country\n\n-Got Death Threats everyday\n\n-Got attacked, harassed\n\n-Tried to kidnap me in Indonesia FREEDOM IS NOT FREE \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nKanter is Turkish but a fierce critic of Erdogan, a dangerous thing for a prominent Turk to be. Last week, while woke heroes like Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich were whimpering through interviews about the NBA\u2019s China mess, Kanter used the Boston Globe\u2019s op-ed to extend another middle finger to Erdogan: \u201cI will not be silenced over Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cConstant pressure by Turkish consulates across the United States, as well as pervasive and continual harassment by the government in Turkey, has so far failed to stifle my dissent. As they increase the pressure, I raise my voice. I won\u2019t be deterred. They\u2019re wasting their time. \u201cHow can I stay silent? There are tens of thousands of people \u2014 including teachers, doctors, members of the judiciary and military, lawyers, bureaucrats, journalists, and activists \u2014 in prisons for years just because they\u2019re not die-hard followers of Erdogan. Hundreds of babies are growing up in small prison cells with their mothers. Democracy today is on life support, if not dead, and anyone who speaks up faces prison time.\u201d\n\nImagine the endorsement deals Kanter would have in Turkey right now as a famous NBA player if only he were willing to play ball with the ruling regime. He\u2019s one of the most famous Turkish athletes in the world. But he\u2019s willing to leave some money \u2014 a lot of money \u2014 on the table because, in the end, what\u2019s right is right. He\u2019s using his platform to speak for those whose voices can\u2019t be heard.\n\nHe\u2019s LeBron 2018 except he actually means it.\n\nBy the way, John Cooper of the Heritage Foundation noticed this morning that ESPN is *still* referring to Hong Kong demonstrators as \u201canti-government protesters.\u201d They\u2019ve been doing that since this story began but it\u2019s not less obnoxious a week later considering that \u201canti-government\u201d is the least charitable way to describe what Hong Kongers want. \u201cHuman rights protesters\u201d or \u201cpro-democracy demonstrators\u201d would work just as well but that would risk offending the Chinese by acknowledging implicitly that human rights and democracy are wanting in China. Instead they chose a term that\u2019s completely morally neutral: \u201cAnti-government.\u201d Enes Kanter is an \u201canti-government protester\u201d too, you know.", "description": "Fraud.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
