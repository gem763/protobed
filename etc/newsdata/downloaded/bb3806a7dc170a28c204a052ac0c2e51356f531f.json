Governor to Back Impeachment Inquiry", "language": "en", "text": "Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont on Thursday endorsed the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, becoming the first Republican governor to do so.\n\nMr. Scott\u2019s announcement, at a news conference, was carefully calibrated. He did not say that he believed Mr. Trump should be impeached, much less removed from office. He said only that Congress should examine the full whistle-blower report, and that it was appropriate for the House to proceed with the inquiry that Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it leads from here is going to be driven by the facts that are established,\u201d he said.\n\nHis remarks at the news conference mirrored a statement his office released beforehand, in which he said he supported the opening of an inquiry but also added: \u201cMost realize impeachment is a very serious issue and should not be taken lightly or abused. Congress has a solemn responsibility to every American to fulfill its role in our government system of checks and balances. It is my hope they will be objective and let their work take them wherever the facts lead, and they will be transparent with the American people every step of the way.\u201d", "description": "Mr. Scott, a moderate from Vermont who has broken with President Trump in the past, said he hoped the House would go \u201cwherever the facts lead.\u201d", "authors": ["Maggie Astor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/politics/26gop-impeach/26gop-impeach-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
