McGregor coach unrepentant over 'sexist' gender equality tweet", "language": "en", "text": "Conor McGregor coach John Kavanagh has remained unrepentant over his tweet lampooning a $1 billion pledge to promote gender equality from Microsoft founder Bill Gates' parter Melinda as '\"a wife spending her husband's money\".\n\nA Forbes article reported that Melinda would pledge the hefty sum to promote gender equality in the U.S. over the next 10 years through foundations set up by the couple.\n\nThe news seemed to strike a chord with Kavanagh, who called out the mission from Gates, married to the man world's 2nd-richest person by the same publication, to \u201cempower women\u201d as perhaps a tad hypocritical.\n\nNothing says equality like a wife spending her husband's money \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/2GJbSvIsEC \u2014 Coach Kavanagh (@John_Kavanagh) October 8, 2019\n\n\"Nothing says equality like a wife spending her husband's money,\" Kavanagh joked, insinuating the cash Melinda would be splashing on the endeavor was in fact Bill\u2019s and therefore defeating the object of her noble principles in the Irishman\u2019s eyes.\n\nThe tweet went viral, being retweeted by UFC color commentator and podcaster Joe Rogan. What followed was a landslide of replies to the SBG Ireland trainer; some accused him of ignorance, while others agreed.\n\nWhen your fighters keep losing and you have to resort to controversy marketing to stay in the limelight. \u2014 Euric (@ItsEuric) October 8, 2019\n\nWow! She was the first woman with an mba to work at Microsoft. She\u2019s also founded several investment companies.

What it must be like to have that kind of view of a supportive relationship. \u2014 Brian Govatos (@briangovatos) October 8, 2019\n\nAfter the tweet went viral, Kavanagh experienced a surge in attention toward his Twitter account, and also the negative reaction, which, and triggered a response you might expect from the man who has nurtured motormouth McGregor from rookie fighter to UFC legend.\n\n\"Well I guess that tweet went viral with +50k likes and +5k new followers,\" Kavanagh wrote, before seemingly acknowledging his words may have hurt the feelings of social justice warriors.\n\nWell I guess that tweet went viral with +50k likes and +5k new followers. But my joke hurt a lot of people and I should have thought about their feelings before making it. So I'd like to take this opportunity to apologise...to absolutely nobody \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Coach Kavanagh (@John_Kavanagh) October 9, 2019\n\n\"But my joke hurt a lot of people and I should have thought about their feelings before making it.
