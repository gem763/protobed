National Security Council personnel edited a memo written about the call. White House lawyers, according to a government whistleblower , directed that the memo be uploaded into a highly restricted classified computer network. And there were the staffers whose keystrokes on a computer made that happen.\n\nThey represent a universe of people, little known outside their vital circle of national security officials, who can either support or disavow the whistleblower\u2019s account. Their roles could well become more public as the impeachment investigation unfolds and Congress seeks additional witnesses.\n\nSome staffers involved with the call still work at the White House; others have left. But what was thought to be a routine conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy turned into anything but that, when Trump asked him to investigate Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 presidential election and the activities of Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n___\n\n30 MINUTES THAT CHANGED THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY\n\nBy the time staffers in the Situation Room got the president of Ukraine on the phone at 9:03 a.m., Trump had just finished firing off tweets claiming complete vindication from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony the day before about the Russia investigation. On the call, Trump was first to speak. He showered the 41-year-old Ukrainian, a novice politician and former comedian, with praise following his party\u2019s victory in parliamentary elections. Zelenskiy chatted about how he wanted to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Kyiv and how he wished the European Union would provide more financial support. He told Trump that Ukraine was ready to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States.\n\nThe next 10 words that came out of Trump\u2019s mouth - \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though\u201d - are what triggered the House impeachment inquiry that has imperiled his presidency.\n\nTrump asked Zelenskiy to work with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to look into Biden and his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump says it was an innocent, \u201cperfect\u201d call. But some White House staffers, worried that Trump seemed to be asking Ukraine for dirt on Biden, sounded alarms. They suggested the memorandum of the call - \u201ctelcon\u201d for short - be transferred into a restricted server, usually reserved for documents about covert operations.\n\n___\n\nBEFORE THE CALL\n\nThis call, as well as others Trump has had with foreign leaders, was unusual in other ways, too. In past administrations, top foreign policy officials routinely briefed a president in person right before a call and provided written materials as well.\n\nA former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul worked at the NSC during the Obama administration and helped write briefs to prepare for dozens of calls with Russian leaders, including Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cJudging from the content of the Trump-Zelenskiy call, Trump was not reading talking points,\u201d McFaul said. \u201cNo one on our team ever would have prepared a call package prompting Obama to ask for a personal favor that would help him win reelection. I also doubt that Trump\u2019s NSC staff would have written or cleared such a talking point for their boss.\u201d\n\nOne individual with firsthand knowledge of how the Trump calls with foreign leaders are handled said the president \u201chates\u201d such \u201cpre-briefs\u201d and frequently has refused to do them. Trump doesn\u2019t like written background materials either, preferring to handle the calls himself, often in the morning from the residence. Occasionally, while on the phone with foreign heads of state, Trump has handed the receiver to his daughter, Ivanka Trump, so she can talk with the leader, according to this individual.\n\nThe person said a six-page pre-brief with attachments was once prepared for Trump before a call to a foreign leader. But that turned out to be too long, as did a single-page version. Preparing pre-brief note cards that offered about three talking points for Trump to make on a call was the norm, according to this person, who feared retribution for describing this process and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe individual said that when Trump is done with the note cards, he often rips them up and tosses them in a burn bag. Staff who handle records have had to retrieve the burn bags from the residence, put the papers out on a table and tape them back together to preserve them as official presidential records, this person said.\n\n___\n\nRUN OF THE MILL\n\nCalls between a president and a foreign leader typically start with U.S. intelligence officers detailed to the White House gathering in the Situation Room, a process that has been in place for decades, according to two people familiar with the operation in the Trump White House and past administrations. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss how Trump\u2019s calls with foreign heads of state are handled.\n\nDuring the Ukraine call, several others listened in. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Keith Kellogg, national security adviser for Vice President Mike Pence, were on the call. It\u2019s unclear if they were at the White House or listened in on \u201cdrop\u201d lines, secure hookups top officials can use from outside the White House.\n\nOthers who typically would have listened in would have been the president\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, or his deputy, Charles Kupperman, who have both left the White House; the NSC\u2019s director of Russia and Europe, who currently is Tim Morrison; the NSC\u2019s Ukraine expert; and possibly someone from White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s office.\n\nLawyers who handle NSC issues include John Eisenberg and his deputy, Michael Ellis. It\u2019s unclear what, if any, role Ellis played, but the former counsel for the House Intelligence Committee has been in the spotlight before.\n\nThe New York Times reported in March 2017 that he allowed his former boss, the then-committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to review classified material at the White House, seeking to bolster Trump\u2019s claim that he was wiretapped during the 2016 campaign on the orders of the Obama administration. The intelligence reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about trying to develop contacts in the inner circle of then President-elect Trump. The report was not confirmed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe NSC declined to confirm who was on the call.\n\nDown in the Situation Room, several others would have been listening. One person monitors the call to make sure the line is not interrupted. Others are tasked with documenting what is said. No audio recordings are made. The memorandum of the call, the telcon, which the White House has released, is the closest thing to a word-for-word transcript that is produced and is the official presidential record of the conversation.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the Situation Room and my predecessor explained this incredibly inefficient process that we use, I had a lot of questions,\u201d said Larry Pfeiffer, a 30-year U.S. intelligence veteran who managed the Situation Room during the Obama years. \u201cI said \u2018Why don\u2019t we just record the call and write a transcript based on that?\u2019\u201d\n\nPfeiffer said his predecessor told him that the White House stopped taping presidential calls in the 1970s when President Richard Nixon recorded 3,700 hours of conversations, transcripts of which were used by Watergate investigators and during impeachment hearings that followed.\n\nPfeiffer said White House lawyers finally approved the idea of having a duty officer, wearing a headset, sit in a separate room, and repeat what was said on the call into voice-to-text software - again without creating any audio recording.\n\nIndividuals familiar with Trump White House procedure say one Situation Room staffer, using voice-to-text software, repeats each word the president says and another listens and repeats what the foreign leader says. The software turns the words they repeat into text and a rough draft of the telcon is produced.\n\nThat draft is given to subject matter specialists on the NSC, who edit the draft for accuracy. Each draft is separately preserved. After it\u2019s finalized, it\u2019s turned over to the national security adviser - Bolton, at the time - or the deputy, who was Kupperman, for their approval. White House lawyers also play a role in approving NSC documents.\n\nAfter that, the telcon is given back to staffers tasked with preserving the document as a presidential record.\n\n___\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER SOUNDS OFF\n\nSomewhere during this sequence, people privy to the call questioned whether Trump was pressuring the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. Trump has denied that he did and publicly released the telcon recounting what was said on the call.\n\nHe released it after a whistleblower, a CIA officer, filed a complaint about the call with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general. \u201cIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to lock down\u201d all records of the phone call, the whistleblower wrote. \u201cThis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d\n\nThe unidentified whistleblower - one of two who have come forward - said White House lawyers directed that the telcon be taken off a computer server where classified documents on foreign leader calls are normally kept. They directed it be transferred to a computer network with restricted access for documents about covert operations or other highly sensitive information. The telcon, which was classified as secret, did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\n\nOne of the two people familiar with how foreign leader calls are handled in the Trump White House said putting a document classified only as \u201csecret\u201d into a server holding very highly classified information is not against any rule, but is a means of \u201cleak prevention.\u201d\n\nThat person also said it wasn\u2019t common practice to put telcons into the more restrictive server, but that around the same time Bolton became national security adviser in the spring of 2018, it became standard not to share the telcons with the State Department, the national intelligence director and the Pentagon.\n\nThose officials were told that if they wanted to see them, they could read them the next time they were at the White House, the individual said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There were dozens of ears listening to President Donald Trump's 30-minute phone call with the leader of Ukraine that is at the center of a House impeachment inquiry , and as many eyes that saw what he said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Deb Riechmann"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/trump_impeachment_phone_call_30169_c0-164-3931-2457_s1200x700.jpg?2c5154aebff4d2e39e1b0c67b166a4f279430b0d", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
