Each Friday, The Verge\u2019s Cut the Crap column simplifies the choice by sorting through the overwhelming multitude of movies and TV shows on subscription services and recommending a single perfect thing to watch this weekend.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nGosford Park, a multi-Oscar-nominated 2001 drawing-room mystery, written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman. A riff on the classic \u201cmurder at a sprawling country estate\u201d story, the movie features a cast of accomplished UK and American actors \u2014 including Helen Mirren, Richard E. Grant, Stephen Fry, Clive Owen, Emily Watson, Kelly Macdonald, and Ryan Phillippe \u2014 playing 1930s rich folks and servants, gathered for a weekend of dining and hunting that gets interrupted by their host\u2019s suspicious death. Altman and Fellowes have fun with the rigidity of the British class system and the arcane rituals of service \u2014 just as Fellowes would do again a decade later with the creation of hit TV series Downton Abbey.\n\nWhy watch now?\n\nBecause the feature film version of Downton Abbey arrives in theaters across the United States this weekend.\n\nFellowes\u2019 visually splendid, addictively melodramatic series became a sensation when it debuted on ITV in 2010 and then on PBS in the US in 2011. Over the course of its six seasons, Downton Abbey covered roughly 15 years in the life of the landed, aristocratic Crawley family as well as their servants and tenants. Set between 1912 and 1926, the show charts how the turbulence of the early 20th century \u2014 the wars, economic booms and busts, and various progressive social causes \u2014 eroded England\u2019s old order, closing the curtain on an era when only the idle rich could dictate how their country was run.\n\nEvery week, Noel Murray\u2019s Cut the Crap column recommends a single film or show to stream and provides a pocket education on one director, subgenre, movement, or moment in pop culture history. From evil doll movies to alternate-reality stories to Game of Thrones pre-history, the extensive Cut the Crap archives will teach you new things about culture\u2019s past while cutting through the mountain of new releases to find one relevant thing that\u2019s worth watching.\n\nThe 2015 series finale left the door open for more stories about the Crawleys. The Downton Abbey movie is set in 1927, and it uses the hubbub of a royal visit as a way to catch fans up on what the family and their employees have been up to since the show ended. The two-hour film \u2014 running just a little less than the length of three TV episodes \u2014 mixes the show\u2019s usual wry humor and exaggerated intrigue into an examination of how even the honor of hosting a king and queen could come to mean something different in a decade marked by pro-democratic and anti-colonialist movements.\n\nFrom the start, Downton Abbey won acclaim for its lavish re-creations of period fashions and decor. But the show\u2019s massive popularity was just as attributable to its soapy plots, which dealt with forbidden romance, sexual indiscretion, and yes, murder. In that way, the series was a natural successor to Gosford Park. (Downton Abbey was originally developed as a TV version of Gosford Park before Fellowes decided to take the project in a different direction.) On a narrative level, the 2001 Altman movie is like several episodes of the series: over the course of its 137 minutes, it gradually reveals shocking secrets about the relationships between the servants and their employers, while exposing the many sins of the estate\u2019s lord, stabbing victim Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon).\n\nTonally, Gosford Park is very different from Downton Abbey, thanks largely to Altman. The director had only five years left to live when he made this film, and, at the time, he had recently received a heart transplant. Late in his career, Altman entered a gentler phase, losing a lot of the satirical bite and acerbic cynicism of his earlier movies and replacing them with a genuine affection for watching talented actors do their work. For a film about homicide and class conflict, Gosford Park is surprisingly congenial.\n\nWho it\u2019s for\n\nAnglophiles and Altman fans.\n\nThe late, great Robert Altman believed the director\u2019s job was to create a sense of reality \u2014 not realism, per se, but a belief within the audience that the world they were seeing extended beyond the bounds of stage or screen. Altman moved the camera restlessly, giving the impression that there was always more to look at than he had the capacity to show. He encouraged his casts to improvise as much as they wanted and to keep talking even when they weren\u2019t the focus of a scene, just in case they ended up in one of his long, drifting shots.\n\nGosford Park\u2019s cast of theater-trained veterans stayed fairly faithful to Fellowes\u2019 words, aside from some off-handed remarks at the edges of the frame. But Altman and the actors still foster an illusion of spontaneity through their relaxed line-deliveries and subtly reactive facial expressions. (Dame Maggie Smith, who went on to star in Downton Abbey, does as much with an arched eyebrow and a forced smile as she does with Fellowes\u2019 witty quips.) Downton Abbey has sometimes been criticized as reactionary, as Fellowes appears to pine for the vanished England where everyone knew their place. But there isn\u2019t much nostalgia in Gosford Park, which feels deeply lived-in and populated by people who appear exhausted by the burdens of their stations.\n\nWhere to see it\n\nGosford Park is airing on Showtime this month, so it\u2019s available via the Showtime streaming service. To catch up with Downton Abbey, meanwhile, turn to Amazon Prime Video, which is also the home of Fellowes\u2019 first post-Abbey television project, an entertaining miniseries adaptation of Anthony Trollope\u2019s novel Doctor Thorne.", "description": "Robert Altman\u2019s film was written by Downton Abbey\u2019s creator", "authors": ["Noel Murray", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdYWbct8jLuD2quyHu8tezSQDYw=/0x0:1600x838/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19215540/GosfordPark.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
