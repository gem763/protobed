Interestingly, the IWM peaked in early May ahead of both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nLet's drill down in the charts of the IWM and see what other clues may surface.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of the IWM, below, we can see the early May zenith in price. A lower high can be seen in late July, and last week IWM was testing the late May early June low. The slopes of both the 50-day moving average line and the 200-day moving average line are negative.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line largely moved sideways from April to July when it turned lower signaling that sellers were more aggressive.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum study at the bottom of the chart shows lower highs from January to April to July, telling us of the slowing of the uptrend.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of IWM, below, we can see a more important price peak back in 2018 and three peaks so far this year. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is pointed down as is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of IWM, below, we can see a potential downside price target of $133.78 being projected. A trade at $143.60 should weaken this chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: I would be prepared for the IWM to work lower into October. A trade at $143.60 could precipitate further declines with the $134 area as the target.", "description": "Let's drill down in the charts of the IWM and see what clues may surface....IWM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Small-Caps Have Been Leading The Way Lower", "Let'S Drill Down In The Charts Of The Iwm", "See What Clues May Surface.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Guy Ortmann"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/a254ed2a-b07f-11e8-89cc-e9a1f962914c.jpg"}
