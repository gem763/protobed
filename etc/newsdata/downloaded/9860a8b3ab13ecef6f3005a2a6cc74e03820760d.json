REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney could be asked to extend his term if Brexit is delayed again, according to the report.\n\nThe Treasury, in response to the FT report, said that the process of appointing the next BoE chief is on track.\n\n\u201cThe process is on track and we will make an appointment in due course\u201d, a Treasury spokesman said in an emailed statement.\n\nBoE said it had no comment on the FT article.\n\nA short list of candidates to succeed Carney has been sent to the Treasury by a panel of senior civil servants and an independent member, the FT reported.\n\nThe list is said to include Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey, Santander UK Chair Shriti Vadera, London School of Economics head Minouche Shafik and BoE deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe.\n\nMinisters are not likely to meet the British government\u2019s deadline of announcing Carney\u2019s successor this autumn, the report added.\n\nThe process of choosing the next governor is going \u201cvery slowly\u201d and an expected election in November or December makes it likely that the appointment will not be made until a new government was in place, according to the report.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last month that the next Bank of England chief must be independent without commenting on whether the successful candidate had to be a Brexit supporter.\n\nCarney is due to stand down at the end of January 2020. His successor will be formally chosen by the finance minister, Sajid Javid.", "description": "The appointment of the next governor of the Bank of England will be pushed back until after the forthcoming election, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing people briefed on the matter.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430976334&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1SG", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
