The outlook, as per the daily chart would turn bullish above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility has hit its lowest level in over four months \u2013 a price squeeze that may force a significant move either way.\n\nBTC\u2019s bull run stalled at highs above $13,800 on June 26 and prices have created lower highs and higher lows ever since.\n\nNotably, the trading range has narrowed sharply over the last two weeks, with bitcoin consolidating between $9,850 and 10,950, as per Bitstamp data.\n\nAs a result, the Bollinger bands \u2013 volatility indicators placed 2 standard deviations above and below the price\u2019s 20-day moving average \u2013 have narrowed sharply.\n\nMore importantly, Bollinger bandwidth, an indicator used to gauge market volatility, has dropped to 0.11 \u2013 the lowest reading since May. 3, as seen in the chart below.\n\nBollinger Bandwidth\n\nThe volatility level has dropped steadily from 0.62 to lows near 0.10 in the 2.5-months.\n\nIn the past, BTC has witnessed big moves following drops to or below 0.10 (marked by arrows).\n\nFor instance, the bandwidth dropped to 0.06 a week before BTC broke into a bull market with a high-volume move to $5,000 on April 2. It also fell to 0.10 on May 2 \u2013 a day before BTC jumped above $5,600, marking an upside break of a three-week-long consolidation. And, in the days leading up to last November\u2019s sell-off below $6,000, volatility dropped to 0.05.\n\nIf history is a guide, then BTC could soon witness a big move on either side. Technical analysis theory also states than an extended period of low volatility is often followed by a big move.\n\nWhile the record high hash rate (miner confidence) is calling a bullish move, the technical charts are beginning to favor the bears.\n\nAs of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,170 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis.\n\nDaily chart\n\nBitcoin jumped 2.6 percent on Sept. 12, confirming an upside break of a falling wedge pattern. The bullish breakout, however, failed to draw bids and the cryptocurrency has ended up creating another lower high at $10,458 (Sept. 13 high).\n\nWith the failed breakout, the bearish view put forward by Sept. 6\u2019s big red engulfing candle has gained credence.\n\nBTC risks falling back to the Sept. 11 low of $9,855 in the short-term. A violation there would open the doors for $9,320 (Aug. 29 low).\n\nA few observers are calling for a deeper drop to levels below $8,000. That possibility cannot be ruled out as the cryptocurrency is looking heavy on the longer duration charts.\n\nMonthly and weekly charts\n\nThe back-to-back inside bar candlestick patterns on the monthly chart (above left) indicate buyer exhaustion following a stellar rally from $4,000 to $13,880.\n\nA bearish \u201cinside bar\u201d reversal would be confirmed if prices close (UTC) below $9,049 \u2013 the low of the first inside bar created in July \u2013 on Sept. 30.\n\nFurther, a negative reading on the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicates scope for a deeper pullback.\n\nThe bearish case would weaken if prices rise above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high), invalidating the lower highs setup on the daily chart.\n\nThat said, a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed for bull revival, as discussed last month.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bitcoin-btc-chart.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
