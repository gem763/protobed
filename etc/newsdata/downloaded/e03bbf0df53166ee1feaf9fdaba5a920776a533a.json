Or so they told me, and I did not argue about it.\n\nThis tells it own story. Some were very poor, and looked it, and I don\u2019t really blame them for their actions. Lebanon has never been a very rich nation \u2013 save for their Sunni merchants and Christian bankers \u2013 and these were the people who did not have enough to eat. For days, they had been protesting their fate. The Lebanese pound had fallen, the price of food had rocketed \u2013 all true, I promise you \u2013 and they protested.\n\nI was not surprised, yet there was something new and surprising about this. All this week, the mountains of Lebanon have burned. Their great glory of pine trees and wonderful mountainsides have blossomed with flames. The government\u2019s three anti-fire helicopters lay rotting at Beirut international airport \u2013 the government did not maintain them \u2013 and it needed Greece and Cyprus and Jordan to send its aircraft to quench the burning hills. My own apartment on the Beirut seafront stank of smoke. On Wednesday night, God visited Lebanon \u2013 he does come here occasionally, I have decided \u2013 and drenched the country in rain and tempest. On Thursday morning, my balcony was covered in sand and ash.\n\nBut there is something far more serious going on here. The physical rage of Lebanese people is not just a militia outburst. It\u2019s not because ordinary people are hungry \u2013 and they are \u2013 but because an unjust system (ever more taxes, ever higher prices) is making it impossible to work to bring home money and food.\n\nLet me ask just one small question. On the corniche seafront where I live \u2013 the Avenue de Paris, as the French mandate decided it should be called in the 1920s \u2013 almost every apartment block is empty. Save for those who share the small bloc where I live, there is nothing but darkness. You can drive downtown from here, for miles to the centre of Beirut, and you will not find a light. These buildings are owned as investments \u2013 by Iraqis, for the most part, but also by Syrians and Saudis \u2013 and no one lives there.\n\nIn a country where the poor of the Beqaa Valley and the refugees from Syria and the Palestinian refugees (of whom of course we no longer speak, since they are the wreckage of the Israeli state) exist in shacks, these mighty sentinels of cash stand triumphant: empty, rich and shameful.\n\nSo I fear we shall have more burning tyres on the road.", "description": "I thought the days when I kicked burning tyres off roads had ended.
