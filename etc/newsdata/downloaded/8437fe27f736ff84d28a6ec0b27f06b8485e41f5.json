Repeated calls and messages to France\u2019s foreign ministry were not answered.\n\nSince 2017 Brazil has sought membership of the OECD club of developed nations, eager for the label of approval required by many investors. While Brazil\u2019s bid for full membership and its desire to join the environmental body are technically unrelated, the decision sours the atmosphere around the ongoing negotiations between the Latin American country and the Paris-based OECD.\n\nFrance\u2019s decision was \u201cpolitical\u201d in nature and \u201cdoes nothing to contribute to the global cause of environmentalism,\u201d the Brazilian foreign ministry statement added.\n\nThe wrangling over membership of the committee also marks the latest nadir in relations between Brazil and the European country over President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s environmental policies. Ahead of the Group of Seven summit in France in late August, President Emmanuel Macron threatened to scrap a trade deal between the European Union and the South American customs union Mercosur over what he described as Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201clies\u201d on climate change commitments.\n\nBolsonaro punched back at what his administration saw as an infringement of Brazilian sovereignty, and his government has undertaken a public relations campaign asserting its commitment to protecting and sustainably developing the rainforest. The fight turned personal when Bolsonaro retweeted a supporter\u2019s criticism of Macron\u2019s wife\u2019s appearance.\n\nRead more: Bolsonaro Slams Socialism, Urges Respect for Amazon Policy at UN\n\nWhile in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, Bolsonaro trumpeted Brazil\u2019s environmental policies and said that those who questioned his record were concerned with exploiting the country\u2019s mineral wealth. He didn\u2019t take part in Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 all-day climate change summit.\n\nOECD Bid\n\nLast month, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles went to the headquarters of the OECD to present Brazil\u2019s pledge to adhere to dozens of standards and rules called environment instruments, with the aim of becoming a participant of the environment committee, a status one step below the committee\u2019s full membership.\n\nAfter the presentation, Salles was asked to leave the room so that the members could deliberate. When he came back, he was informed that the representatives would need more time to review Brazil\u2019s candidacy, according to a person who participated in the meeting.\n\nThe person said the presentation lacked some elements and some countries believed that the case was not convincing at this point, which led the board to agree to resume discussions next year. A Brazilian official with direct knowledge said a new round of talks is scheduled for April 2020.\n\nIn a statement, an OECD spokesperson said the Environmental Policy Committee \u201cis examining a request from Brazil to become a participant of the committee and adhere to certain OECD instruments in the field of environment, and will continue to engage with Brazil on this in the coming weeks and months.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Helene Fouquet.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Samy Adghirni in Brasilia Newsroom at sadghirni@bloomberg.net;Simone Iglesias in Bras\u00edlia at spiglesias@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Juan Pablo Spinetto at jspinetto@bloomberg.net, Bruce Douglas\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Brazil accused France of blocking its entry to a key international environmental body, just weeks after their leaders traded insults over wildfires in the Amazon.The decision to postpone the discussion of Brazil\u2019s participation in the environmental committee of the Organization of Economic", "authors": ["Samy Adghirni", "Simone Iglesias"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tOux.M22zlD6mSCqelKcvw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ebd67f0f709dc565d933523e071df1d5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
