These 6 movies are already the talk of awards season\n\nRap hitmaker Cardi B and \"Truth Hurts\" breakthrough Lizzo make their big-screen acting debuts as Diamond and Liz, respectively, strippers at the seedy New York club where newcomer Destiny (Constance Wu) gets her start at the beginning of the film. At first, Diamond doesn't welcome Destiny with open arms, brusquely telling her to \"back off, b----)\" when she sees her flirting with potential male clientele.\n\nBut Diamond quickly warms up to the club rookie, playfully bemoaning how men don't like dating strippers as they chat backstage. (\"Everyone wants to date a stripper ... until they learn we work six nights a week,\" she says before extolling the virtues of sex toys.) In one of the film's most memorable scenes, she shows Destiny how to give the perfect lap dance, grinding on her as she instructs that taking your time is key.\n\nLizzo, too, gets brief moments to shine as Liz: busting out her signature flute backstage and playing a few notes before nestling it between another stripper's breasts. She gets some hilarious one-liners, such as her explanation for not dating: \"I just wanna sit on my (expletive) couch with my (expletive) ice cream.\"\n\nLizzo broke through on the charts this year with hits More\n\nWhen the club gets a surprise celebrity guest, she gleefully runs into the dressing room and announces \"Usher, b----!\" before the entire group dances on stage for the cash-throwing \"Love in this Club\" crooner.\n\nMore: Jennifer Lopez spills about Usher's 'Hustlers' cameo, Lizzo danced with the flu\n\nCardi and Lizzo don't get a ton of screen time, and their charming characters bow out a little before the movie's halfway mark, when Destiny gets pregnant and quits her stripping job just as the 2008 stock market crash ravages the club. But they make the most of their limited scenes and have charisma in spades, making us hope it's not the last time we see them light up the big screen.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'Hustlers': How are Cardi B and Lizzo in their first movie?", "description": "Chart-toppers Cardi B and Lizzo make their acting debuts in stripper drama \"Hustlers,\" which is earning Oscar buzz for Jennifer Lopez.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ocnJEPZSMaUGG9f.mafOhw--~B/aD0zMzk1O3c9NTA5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/d7c9080b078a3e6f6cf58dfa8e992587", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
