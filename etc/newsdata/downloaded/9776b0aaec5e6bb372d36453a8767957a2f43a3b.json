Why isn't he doing the same to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who's been climbing in the polls and has a shot at becoming the Democratic nominee for president?\n\nFroma Harrop\n\nThe clear answer is that Biden, in his own words, could \"beat him like a drum\" -- and while Warren could win against Trump, her victory does not look like a resounding one, according to recent polls . In Trump's view, Biden poses the greatest threat and must be destroyed. And what better way than to wound Biden to the point that Democrats might think he's more trouble than he's worth?\n\nBiden already disturbs some Democrats with his non-combative personality and centrist views. Add in a fake scandal that Trumpland generated, and many Democrats backing Biden may ask, \"Well, who else do we have?\" They should know that nearly anyone else they nominate would be harder to elect. And by abandoning Biden, they would be giving credence to the slander.\n\nWarren fans will point to national polls showing their candidate defeating Trump in a general election. But it's important to note that Warren has been largely spared from Trump's attacks thus far, and those polls don't take into account the campaign of calumny that would surely follow a Warren nomination. It's Biden that Trump clearly most fears.\n\nIt would not surprise me if foreign propagandists decided to take to social media to advance Warren's candidacy and hurt Biden's. This happened in 2016, when Russian trolls tried to turn fans of Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. Many supporters took the bait and either voted for third party candidates or sat out the election.", "description": "Democrats might ask themselves why President Donald Trump is so intent on smearing former Vice President Joe Biden with phony scandals, writes Froma Harrop.
