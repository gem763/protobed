safety breaches after a worker was crushed to death by a falling stack of tyres\n\nRobert Baynham, 50, was killed when two half tonne Bridgestone wheels toppled from a frame and smashed through the office roof where he was working at the Prologis business park in Coventry.\n\nThe married father was crushed beneath the tyres and rushed to hospital but he died as a result of multiple injuries on February 2, 2016.\n\nA court heard no risk assessment had been put in place by the firm where there was a 'focus on product movement rather than health and safety.'\n\nRobert Baynham, 50, was killed when two half tonne Bridgestone wheels toppled from a frame and smashed through the office roof where he was working at the Prologis business park in Coventry (pictured)\n\nThree other workers were also injured, one severely, during the freak accident at the firm's tyre distribution centre.\n\nDHL Services Ltd pleaded guilty to failing to carry out a risk assessment and failing to ensure the safety of employees at Warwick Crown Court.\n\nOn Monday the company was fined \u00a32.6 million for what Mr Justice Jeremy Baker described as a 'high degree of culpability' for a 'serious corporate failure.'\n\nHe said: 'The immediate cause of the stack toppling over is unclear, but not only was it comprised of different sizes of tyres, the handling driver was in the process of constructing a similar stack which may have led to some contact with it.\n\n'Although there may have been an individualised failure to make a proper risk assessment, there was a corporate failure to do so.\n\n'The cause and effect of those failures is that a stack containing an excessive number of stillages had been placed in an area where people were working.\n\n'When the driver was in the process of making a new stack, contact with the first stack caused it to topple over and fall onto those working in the office.\n\n'There is no question that these failures have led to a human tragedy.\n\nThe married father was crushed beneath the tyres and rushed to hospital but he died as a result of multiple injuries on February 2, 2016\n\n'Robert Baynham was a family man, having met his wife of 30 years when they were teenagers.\n\n'His death has deprived their children of their father.\n\n'The defendant bore a high degree of culpability for these offences.\n\n'There was a serious corporate failure to ensure that suitable assessments had been made prior to this incident.\n\n'As at the date of the incident the defendant had failed to put into place measures which were recognised standards in the industry.\n\n'There was no sufficiently safe system to prevent the stacking of stillages in the configuration and in the location as they were on that night.\n\n'It is fortunate this type of incident in this location had not occurred sooner.'\n\nThe judge said DHL, with \u00a31.4 billion annual turnover, had two previous health and safety convictions in 2017 and 2018.\n\nHe added: 'I accept in this case there are features which reduce the seriousness of the offence or provide mitigation.\n\n'Since the offence DHL has taken steps to remedy the situation.'\n\nProsecutor Bernard Thorogood said the company had 'failed to conduct its own risk assessment and failed to discharge its health and safety duties.'\n\nMr Thorogood said the tyres were held in stillages, metal frames, in which tyres of different types were contained.\n\nA 'tall and heavy stack' of eight cross-stocked stillages had been placed next to an office in which Mr Baynham, John Knight, Bernard Halpin and Jason Gordon were working.\n\nMr Thorogood said: 'The risks of forming stacks of stillages are obvious, and the company knew of previous topples.\n\n'Past events showed this is a well-established risk and should have been factored into the defendant company's consideration.\n\n'But when the stack toppled, possibly after being knocked as a second stack was being put next to it, the top two stillages, each of which weighed 578 kilos, fell through the office roof.\n\n'An error is always possible and the potential for disaster from a small error of judgement is manifest if the stacks are too close.\n\n'All four individuals in the office were at serious risk of losing their lives.'\n\nMr Knight, aged 35, suffered three fractures to his skull, a brain bleed, eight fractured ribs, a fractured collarbone and sternum, and spent two weeks in hospital.\n\nThe other two men were less seriously injured and discharged after treatment, but still deal with the incident's effects, the court was told.",
