It should glow not beam! It will be easy for adults and children alike to turn on and off and perhaps even shut off by itself thanks to a timer.\n\nIf a night light doesn\u2019t offer a timer, we recommend turning a nightlight off once your child is asleep.\n\nIdeally a night light will look cute in a little one\u2019s nursery and be something that they see as being a positive part of bedtime.\n\nPortability is key \u2013 we were particularly impressed with those that could easily be taken on holiday.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This small light is wearable, so there\u2019s no faffing about with iPhone torches or cracking the door open just so. The light is dimmable so you\u2019re in control of how bright you want it to be. The light quality is soft and golden \u2013 and designed to minimise stimulating blue light.\n\nWe found this easy to assemble and wear \u2013 and during an 11pm nappy change, the light was a huge help without startling our dozy toddler. We also appreciated how small the whole set up is. You can fit the whole light into the palm of your hand. When night feeding is no longer on your agenda, the light can live in the nursery to be used as a regular nightlight.\n\nBuy now\n\nGroegg 2 nightlight: \u00a323.99, The Gro Company\n\nThis is the souped up version of the already brilliant original nightlight-cum-room-thermometer which changes colour according to temperature. But the Groegg 2 is even more brilliant. The silicone egg is over a third larger than the original, softer to the touch (it\u2019s actually rather squashy!) and the digital thermometer is easier to read. The night light is gentle and can be adjusted to one of four levels of intensity \u2013 the lowest being ambient and mellow. Can be powered by the mains or USB. We found this easy to operate \u2013 and pack up for travelling.\n\nBuy now\n\nLello little star wall nightlight: \u00a325, Kidly\n\nSmall, portable and cute, this star shaped light looks and feels soft, even when fully lit up. We absolutely loved that this was wall mountable and could be easily operated by little people \u2013 one tap is for full light, two for half light and three to turn it off. The light will fade automatically after an hour \u2013 good news for battery life and for parents who might forget to go in and do it manually.\n\nBuy now\n\nLitecup nightlight: \u00a39.99, Litecup\n\nHalf sippy cup, half night light \u2013 this non-spill beaker with integrated night light is some serious design genius. Gone will be the nights of \u201cWANT WATER\u201d breaking through the 4am silence. The light lets them locate their drink immediately and when our two-year-old tester was not imbibing, she was comforted by the glow from her cup. The Litecup comes in three difference sizes \u2013 Litecup Baby (200ml) which includes an attachable strap, a Little Litecup (250ml) and a Regular Litecup (330ml) for bigger kids. Easy to clean and perfect for travel.\n\nBuy now\n\nWalkabout lantern nightlight: \u00a325, Kidly\n\nA modern take on a pre-electricity staple. This lantern is powered by battery and offers a low, illuminating glow from an LED bulb that can either be low and pulsating or static. This is ideal for toddlers who are potty training and need to make a middle-of-the-night journey to the bathroom. The handle is sturdy and easy to hold while the lantern itself is light. Our three-year-old loved the \u201cone tap\u201d function: all it takes to turn the lantern on and off is a tight touch to the top. However, there is an auto switch which means it can turn off by itself. There is a sense of the theatrical about the lantern too, which makes it fun and playful rather than just solidly functional. Perfectly portable.\n\nBuy now\n\nBedbug nightlight: \u00a359.95, Lumie\n\nThe Bedbug boasts a spectrum of fully changeable lighting \u2013 from sharp, bright light to cosy sleepy fuzz. It contains almost none of the blue light which is the most stimulating. Our two-year-old tester was thrilled with the \u201csunset\u201d feature which echoes a real sunset \u2013 the light fading as the sun does, dipping into blackness \u2013 and sleep. However, if you\u2019d prefer a nightlight on all night, you can adjust the settings accordingly and the Bedbug will glow a low orange all night long.\n\nBuy now\n\nInfantino night pal nightlight: \u00a314.99, Amazon\n\nCalming and cute \u2013 we really rated how this was soft and tactile, as much of a huggable cuddly toy as anything else. It\u2019s also much bigger than the image suggests, so will feel really reassuring to little ones who might need extra comfort when learning to sleep by themselves. The light is glowing and comes in a rainbow of colours. There is even a colour spectrum switch to allow children to choose whichever colour they\u2019d like. The intensity of the light\u2019s brightness can be easily altered. There is also a really sweet musical element: three different melodies play as well as natural sounds which promote sleep. Our tester, at 16 months was thrilled to have a bedfellow but play was short as the whales sleepy inducing properties worked their magic.\n\nBuy now\n\nCookie the cat nightlight: \u00a38.95, Rex London\n\nThis little rotund kitty is surprisingly tactile, with a soft, matte finish. Its light is a dim glow of dark blue and can be easily turned off by a small switch on its underside. This would make for a lovely gift \u2013 the packaging boasts a list of fun cat facts on the outside.\n\nBuy now\n\nInfantino 3-in1 musical soother and night light projector nightlight: \u00a325.99, Argos\n\nThis is actually much bigger in reality than you might think having just looked at the pictures.Not only is it appealing to look at \u2013 colourful and fun \u2013 it also works very hard too. The projections it boasts are soft, soothing cloud and star shapes and lulled our two-year-old tester off into his dreams within ten minutes. There are two different light displays \u2013 one is fixed towards the ceiling and the other moves as the fox\u2019s tail moves. The music is slow and gentle \u2013 and lasts 20 minutes, as does the main light. We loved that there are two parts \u2013 the larger fox which is the source of the projections and music, and the smaller, curled up baby which is a removable light and can be moved around the room.\n\nBuy now\n\nPersonalised white cloud nightlight: \u00a316, My 1st Years\n\nSimple and sweet with a smiling sleepy face on one side \u2013 this night light is small and without any bells or whistles. The light is soft and comforting, however. You can opt to have it personalised, which is an extra cute touch and perfect for gifts.\n\nBuy now\n\nAloka colour & shine nightlight: From \u00a325, Cheeky Rascals\n\nThis is a pretty awesome light \u2013 which doubles up as a toy. Little ones have the chance to customise their own night light \u2013 over and over again. The light comes with five bright dry-erase pens which are to be used on the back of the light. However, parents who favour a paired back, low key or muted aesthetic are unlikely to be thrilled as the look of the Aloka is slightly gaudy.\n\nThe light itself is versatile, beaming out different colours all of which are easily dimmable. Our three-year-old tester was utterly enchanted with the princess version of the Aloka, who was richly and abstracted shaded in pinks and purples. The fact that it can be wiped away cleanly is awesome. The remote control is a brilliant touch for smaller kids who seem drawn to them \u2013 to this multi-coloured gadget is received with utter delight.\n\nYou can set the light to one colour or let it cycle through all 12. This is fun, versatile and serves so many purposes, it\u2019s a bit of a bargain really.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Nightlights\n\nIt\u2019s got to be the Meemoobaby \u2013 it\u2019s so small, but all powerful, easily portable and will last and last from those early nights of multiple wakings, into toddlerhood and beyond.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
