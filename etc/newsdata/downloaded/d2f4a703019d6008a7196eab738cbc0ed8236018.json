A plutonium bomb was dropped on the city of Hiroshima in 1945 and killed thousands of people instantly (pictured)\n\nHOW ARE NUCLEAR BOMBS TESTED TO ENSURE THEY HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED? Under current guidelines and with existing technologies, weapons inspectors rarely know when a warhead has been dismantled. Inspectors rarely get full access to arsenals over concerns around military secrets. During military treaties, to keep both sides happy, nations are willing to prove they have destroyed the weapons. But, the destruction is often dealt to delivery systems (such as missiles or planes) and not to the warheads themselves. For example, the U.S. cut the wings off B-52 bombers and left them in the Arizona desert, where Russia could visually confirm the airplanes' dismemberment. But the warheads, where the bulk of the damage is done and the plutonium is stored, may still be active and waiting for detonation. There is currently no independent way of detecting if these have been dismantled or not. 'There's a real need to preempt these kinds of dangerous scenarios and go after these stockpiles,' says Areg Danagoulian, an MIT nuclear scientist. 'And that really means a verified dismantlement of the weapons themselves.'\n\nStored nuclear warheads that have not been properly dismantled could pose extreme danger if they are sold, stolen or accidentally detonated.\n\n'There's a real need to preempt these kinds of dangerous scenarios and go after these stockpiles,' says Areg Danagoulian, an MIT nuclear scientist who led the project.\n\n'And that really means a verified dismantlement of the weapons themselves.'\n\nThe method developed to stop these issues uses what researchers call an isotopic filter to physically encrypt the information unearthed in the analysis.\n\n'This encrypting filter basically covers up the intrinsic properties of the actual classified object itself,' Dr Danagoulian explains.\n\nThe experiments that led to the breakthrough involved sending a horizontal neutron beam through a warhead.\n\nTo avoid the use of the highly-restricted plutonium, researchers instead opted to use molybdenum and tungsten substitutes as they behave similarly.\n\nThe beam's signal is sent to a glass detector, where the data is recorded.\n\nThe test works, because the neutron beam can identify the isotope in question.\n\n'At the low energy range, the neutrons' interactions are extremely isotope-specific,' Dr Danagoulian says.\n\nAn isotope is a variation of the normal state of an element, and can become unstable due to the presence of various amounts of neutrons.\n\n'So you do a measurement where you have an isotopic tag, a signal which itself embeds information about the isotopes and the geometry.\n\n'But you do an additional step which physically encrypts it.'\n\nThe encryption process stores the data but alters some exact data, to protect any military secrets while revealing the weapon has been dismantled.\n\nThis is key in getting countries on board to willingly subject themselves to tests, the researchers say.\n\n'This encrypting filter basically covers up the intrinsic properties of the actual classified object itself,' Dr Danagoulian explains.\n\nThey chose to change the physical data itself because using the laws of physics as an encryption method is more robust than that of computer, which can be fallible and fooled by hackers.\n\nTo avid the use of the highly-restricted plutonium, which was used in the 'Little Boy' bomb of Hiroshima (pictured) researchers instead opted to use molybdenum and tungsten substitutes as they behave similarly\n\nDr Danagoulian notes: 'You could, in principle, do it with computers, but computers are unreliable. They can be hacked, while the laws of physics are immutable.'\n\nResearchers tested the encryption to make sure the process could not be reverse engineered to undo the protection and unpick another nation's military secrets.\n\nHis prototype is currently (15metres) long and, in future, Dr Danagoulian wants to miniaturise the apparatus and install one at all weapons sites.\n\nThe researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Communications and say far more protocols are needed to be put in place to aid the technique.", "description": "Experts at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have created a neutron beam which can detect the telltale presence of a specific type of plutonium.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/10/13487344-0-image-a-11_1569835671533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
