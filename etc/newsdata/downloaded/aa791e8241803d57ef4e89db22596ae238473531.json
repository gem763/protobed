Col. Alexander Vindman\u2014the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council\u2014will be the first White House official to testify before Congress who listened in on the call in which Trump mentioned corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAccording to a draft statement of Vindman\u2019s remarks obtained by The Daily Beast, he twice raised concerns to superiors about how Trump and other senior officials were handling Ukraine. He took his concerns to NSC lawyer John Eisenberg, once on July 10 and once again shortly after the July 25 call.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman wrote in his draft statement, which was first reported by The New York Times. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden sat on the board of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings while his father was in office.\n\nVindman will tell Congress that he never interacted directly with Trump but that he did confront Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland after a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials.\n\n\u201cAmb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma,\u201d Vindman will say. \u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\n\n\u201cFollowing the debriefing meeting, I reported my concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\u201d\n\nVindman will say that he believed Trump\u2019s demands during the July 25 call would \u201cundermine U.S. national security. Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\u201d\n\nHe will recall how Trump refused to sign a memo he drafted in August that would re-start security aid being withheld from Ukraine. Vindman will also tell Congress how he drafted a letter congratulating Zelensky on his inauguration earlier this year, but Trump also refused to sign that.\n\nVindman is scheduled to appear behind closed doors before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees in defiance of White House order not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. His lawyer, Michael Volkov, has not spoken publicly on the matter.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
