Aside from one wobble that cost her the first set \u2013 broken when serving three double faults \u2013 she was largely untouchable \u2013 with the crafty French Open champion Barty given a lot more to think about.\n\nFatigue may have been a factor in the end for the top seed, who saved match point in a draining semi-final against Kiki Bertens on Saturday, and she fell away somewhat in the third set.\n\nThe pair are both in contention, along with Karolina Pliskova, for year-end No. 1, which will be decided at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen, but Barty remains in the driving seat despite Osaka\u2019s 10-match winning streak.\n\nOsaka came through (Picture: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAfter Barty saved a first break point of the match in the fifth game, she drew first blood in a marathon sixth game \u2013 one in which Osaka served three double faults \u2013 and it proved to be enough to clinch the set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of the first, Osaka\u2019s coach and father Leonard Francois warned against her getting upset on court and that staying calm was the solution to \u2018solving the problem out there\u2019.\n\nBarty went on to save a second break point on her way to establishing a one-set lead, finishing with back-to-back aces.\n\nThe third break point \u2013 in a third separate game \u2013 was the coolest of all. Under immense pressure early in the second set, Barty opted for a high-risk drop-shot, which drifted over gracefully with her opponent stranded at the back of the court.\n\nIt was in the sixth game of the second break where Barty finally faltered. She sent a forehand long as Osaka moved 4-2 up.\n\nWith the set won and the match level, Osaka, now in the ascendancy, then struck at the start of the third to assume control of the tie.\n\nBarty avoided falling a double break behind by saving another break point but failed to make Osaka pay in the next game, missing a break point chance of her own \u2013 the first Osaka had conceded since being broken in the first set \u2013 as she sent a forehand long.\n\nThe double break did eventually come and she went on to lift a second Premier Mandatory title and her fifth WTA crown in total.\n\nNovak Djokovic reigned supreme in Tokyo (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nIn the men\u2019s final in Beijing, Stefanos Tsitsipas will take on Dominic Thiem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Novak Djokovic claimed his 76th ATP Tour title, easing past Australia\u2019s John Millman to win the Japan Open.\n\nThere were mixed results, meanwhile, for Brits in qualifying for the Shanghai Masters.\n\nCam Norrie beat Italy\u2019s Thomas Fabbiano 6-4 6-4 to advance to the main draw of the Masters 1000 event but Dan Evans went down in three sets to France\u2019s Jeremy Chardy.\n\nNorrie will join Andy Murray and Kyle Edmund as the Brits in the main draw in Shanghai.\n\nMORE: Novak Djokovic wins Japan Open on injury return in perfect Tokyo 2020 dry run", "description": "Naomi Osaka fought back from a set down against world No. 1 Ash Barty to win the China Open and claim back-to-back WTA Tour titles.
