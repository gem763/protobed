Officials speculated he had a romantic relationship with the journalist.\n\nThe journalist then asked Frese if he could speak to a second, more senior journalist, to which he agreed if it helped with the first journalist\u2019s career. The Justice Department said the second journalist spoke with Frese and later published an article containing information from a top secret report.\n\n\u201cAs laid out in today\u2019s indictment, Frese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. \u201cFrese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people \u2014 a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country.\u201d\n\nFrese faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on both counts.\n\nDV.load(\u201chttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6464644-USA-v-Frese.js\u201d, {\n\nresponsive: true,\n\nheight: 750,\n\nsidebar: false,\n\ntext: false,\n\ncontainer: \u201c#DV-viewer-6464644-USA-v-Frese\u201d\n\n});\n\nUSA v Frese (PDF)\n\nUSA v Frese (Text)\n\nDV.load(\u201chttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6464644-USA-v-Frese.js\u201d, {\n\nresponsive: true,\n\nheight: 750,\n\nsidebar: false,\n\ntext: false,\n\ncontainer: \u201c#DV-viewer-6464644-USA-v-Frese\u201d\n\n});\n\nUSA v Frese (PDF)\n\nUSA v Frese (Text)\n\nDV.load(\u201chttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6464644-USA-v-Frese.js\u201d, {\n\nresponsive: true,\n\nheight: 750,\n\nsidebar: false,\n\ntext: false,\n\ncontainer: \u201c#DV-viewer-6464644-USA-v-Frese\u201d\n\n});\n\nUSA v Frese (PDF)\n\nUSA v Frese (Text)\n\nDV.load(\u201chttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6464644-USA-v-Frese.js\u201d, {\n\nresponsive: true,\n\nheight: 750,\n\nsidebar: false,\n\ntext: false,\n\ncontainer: \u201c#DV-viewer-6464644-USA-v-Frese\u201d\n\n});\n\nUSA v Frese (PDF)\n\nUSA v Frese (Text)\n\nDV.load(\u201chttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6464644-USA-v-Frese.js\u201d, {\n\nresponsive: true,\n\nheight: 750,\n\nsidebar: false,\n\ntext: false,\n\ncontainer: \u201c#DV-viewer-6464644-USA-v-Frese\u201d\n\n});\n\nUSA v Frese (PDF)\n\nUSA v Frese (Text)\n\nDV.load(\u201chttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6464644-USA-v-Frese.js\u201d, {\n\nresponsive: true,\n\nheight: 750,\n\nsidebar: false,\n\ntext: false,\n\ncontainer: \u201c#DV-viewer-6464644-USA-v-Frese\u201d\n\n});\n\nUSA v Frese (PDF)\n\nUSA v Frese (Text)", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Authorities arrested a Defense Intelligence Agency official Wednesday for leaking classified information linked to the security of a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
