The public\u2019s sentiment reflects the disappointment felt after the North Korea-U.S. working-level talks in Stockholm held from Oct. 4 to 5 fell apart. Former South Korean Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok said, \u201cAt this point, North Korea\u2019s demand is very clear.\u201d In an interview with JoongAng Sunday, Lee shared his opinions on North Korea\u2019s ulterior motives and the prospect of resumption of negotiations. Below are edited excerpts of the interview.. North Korea\u2019s top nuclear envoy Kim Myong-gil said, \u201cThe United States failed to come up with a new calculation method in accordance with North Korea\u2019s demand for a removal of any institutional frameworks undermining North Korea\u2019s security and development.\u201d Concerning the regime\u2019s demand for security guarantees, the veteran diplomat asserted that [the United States] \u201cresumed joint military training with [South Korea], drawing state-of-the-art war machines to the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The remark from the North\u2019s top negotiator was obviously aimed at U.S. President Donald Trump to make good on his promise at the last year\u2019s U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore of suspending military exercises with South Korea. [Fulfilling the promise] would be the first step of showing good faith to ensure a security guarantee and would serve as the precondition for the resumption of talks. The United States must have failed to provide an answer.In North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s speech last April, many experts misinterpreted the phrase, \u201cI won\u2019t be obsessed with issues regarding sanctions anymore,\u201d mistaking that North Korea would put more emphasis on a security guarantee rather than the lifting of sanctions as a corresponding measure for denuclearization. However, the regime is demanding its \u201cright for development and survival\u201d to the United States. This is a subtle way of requesting the lifting of sanctions. Chairman Kim just put it in a different way with his own words.North Korea must have sought lenient conditions on the United Nations Security Council\u2019s sanctions by accepting a \u201csnapback clause\u201d mentioned in the failed second Trump-Kim Summit in Hanoi, which refers to reimposing nuclear related sanctions on North Korea if it is found to be in noncompliance with denuclearization. The North won\u2019t be satisfied with sanctions being postponed on a few random items. From North Korea\u2019s point of view, a verifiable shift in United States\u2019 strategic thinking can only be confirmed when it pursues \u201cstep-by-step simultaneous denuclearization\u201d rather than hostile sanctions and the denuclearization-first approach.[After the breakdown of talks, there hasn\u2019t been any response from President Trump, which is quite unusual. The United States also wasn\u2019t part of the UN Security Council\u2019s joint statement made by six European countries including Britain, France and Germany on Oct. 8 which denounced North Korea for test-firing a submarine-launched ballistic missile.]If the leaders of South Korea and the United States express their willingness to halt joint military drills in their friendly letters, the talks can begin within this year. I can\u2019t provide a specific timeline. However, it must be in President Trump\u2019s calculation that preventing North Korea from conducting nuclear tests or launching intercontinental ballistic missiles would be helpful for the election scheduled for next year.Distrust from North Korea is higher than ever. The historic deal, which promised the dismantlement of the Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for lifting of sanctions, fell apart after it was announced in the Pyongyang Declaration last year in Hanoi. The United States\u2019 joint military exercises with South Korea, though scaled down to division level, went ahead at a low profile. Chairman Kim\u2019s \u201cunconditional resumption\u201d of the Mount Kumgang tour program or the re-opening of the Kaesong Industrial Complex is still up in the air. Last September, President Moon Jae-in suggested transforming the DMZ [demilitarized zone] into an \u201cinternational peace zone\u201d in his keynote speech at the UN General Assembly, but North Korea expects the South to fulfill previous commitments rather than talking about future visions.BY CHA SE-HYEON [kim.byungwook@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/30195305.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
