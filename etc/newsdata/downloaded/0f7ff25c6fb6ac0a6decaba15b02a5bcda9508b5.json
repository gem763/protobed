USA TODAY\n\nDisaster struck for No. 1 Alabama in the first half against longtime rival Tennessee as star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was knocked out of the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy contender appeared to suffer the injury when he was sacked at the 6:44 mark of the second quarter by the Volunteers' Greg Emerson. He would stay in the game for one more play before Alabama took a timeout and he headed for the medical tent.\n\nHe then went to the locker room with about four minutes remaining until halftime. He was replaced by Mac Jones.\n\nNick Saban did not have a full update on Tagovailoa during his interview before halftime but said the QB had \"a twisted ankle of some kind.\"\n\nESPN reported coming out of halftime that Tagovailoa would not return and that they were officially calling it a \"lower-body injury.\"\n\nTua Tagovailoa to the medical tent after this nasty looking ankle injury. pic.twitter.com/AM9cuV11Dx \u2014 Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) October 20, 2019\n\nTua leaves the field and heads back to the locker room near the end of the first half. pic.twitter.com/r8FLBkTfUm \u2014 ESPN College Football (@ESPNCFB) October 20, 2019\n\nThe Crimson Tide led 21-10 at the time of Tagovailoa's injury.
