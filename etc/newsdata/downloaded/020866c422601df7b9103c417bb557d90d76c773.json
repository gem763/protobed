They also failed to avert disaster when at speeds of 48 km/h or higher.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a signal to manufacturers, and a reminder to consumers, that while technology to reduce pedestrian deaths is needed and being implemented, it has some severe limitations. You cannot hand over control of your car and disengage from the complex task of driving, no matter how many systems are being touted.\n\nPedestrian detection is used in combination with automatic emergency braking systems; if the car detects a pedestrian the driver doesn\u2019t, it will alert the driver and start to take action to slow or stop the car. It uses cameras, radar and sensors that allow the car to \u201csee\u201d a pedestrian, and should be very effective in urban areas at speed limits of up to 30 km/h. The AAA study is alarming because the four different vehicles they tested \u2013 Tesla Model 3, Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Chevrolet Malibu \u2013 delivered underwhelming results.\n\nIn daylight, at 32 km/h, the cars hit an adult pedestrian 60 per cent of the time. Even worse, \u201cnone of the test vehicles avoided a collision (or even mitigated the impact speed) with a pedestrian crossing the road immediately after the test vehicle, traveling at 15 mph (24 km/h), made a right-hand turn.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a little one, forget it: \u201cIf the test vehicles came across a child darting into traffic from in between two cars, with the test vehicle traveling at 20 mph (32 km/h), a collision occurred 89 per cent of the time; at 30 mph (48 km/h), none of the test vehicles avoided a collision.\u201d\n\nAre we there yet? Nope. Don\u2019t take your eyes from the road, be aware of your surroundings and don\u2019t count on your car to save those around you \u2014 just yet.", "description": "Many emergency braking systems don't work well over 32 km/h, at night or for child pedestrians, suggests AAA", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/aaa-braking-test.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
