These were people who used it daily or many times a day for many, many years. They all used the powders, and then over time they developed the cancers,\" Moline said.\n\nJust last week, Johnson & Johnson recalled a shipment of baby powder after US authorities found it had been contaminated with asbestos \u2013 the first such recall in the company's history, a spokesperson said.\n\nJohnson & Johnson did not respond to a request for comment on Moline's study, but said in its recall announcement that it has rigorous testing standards in place to ensure the safety of its baby powder.\n\n\"Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos,\" the company's statement said.\n\nThe recall in the United States is limited to a single batch that was only distributed in that country, and South Africa is not affected, the company told Business Insider South Africa.\n\n\n\nIn an emailed response to questions, Johnson & Johnson South Africa said the product was voluntarily recalled in the US \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d\n\nDNA damage that triggers cancer\n\nMesothelioma is a cancer of the lining that covers the outer surface of most internal organs, according to the American Cancer Society. It most often occurs in the lining around the lungs or the abdomen.\n\nAsbestos is the main risk factor for mesothelioma, the cancer society says. It's fairly rare in the United States, with about 3 000 new cases diagnosed each year. But it has an average five-year relative survival rate of just 9%.\n\nPeople usually inhale asbestos fibres, which are so small that 200 000 fibres fit on Abraham Lincoln's nose on a penny, Moline said. The inhaled asbestos makes its way into the lining around the lungs and abdomen, where it causes DNA damage that triggers cancer.\n\nAlthough most mesotheliomas can be tracked back to asbestos exposure, there always have been a number of cases that couldn't be explained that way, Moline said.\n\nResearchers have suspected that talcum powder could be one potential source of asbestos exposure, Moline said. Both minerals are mined from the earth, and sometimes asbestos and talc deposits overlap.\n\n\"The talc, when it's mined, can be contaminated with asbestos when both minerals are present,\" Moline said.\n\nThere's no way to remove asbestos from talc, so the only way to protect consumers is to test what's coming out of the mine, she said.\n\nOnly possible source of exposure\n\nTo examine the possible link between mesothelioma and talcum powder, Moline and her colleagues gathered information on 33 different people with the deadly cancer who'd not been exposed to asbestos in any other way.\n\nThey determined that talcum powder use was the only possible source of asbestos exposure among all 33 cases.\n\nFurther, a closer examination of six specific cases revealed the presence of asbestos in their tissues after decades-long use of talcum powder.\n\n\"They all had the same type of asbestos that is seen in talc in their tissues and in their mesothelioma,\" Moline said. \"The type of asbestos we found is not the type typically seen in commercial applications. It's the type of asbestos you'd find in talc.\"\n\nIn one case, a 65-year-old woman was diagnosed with mesothelioma around her left lung after she complained of a dry cough and short-windedness. She started using talc around age eight or nine, and regularly used it throughout her life. Researchers found asbestos fibres in the tissue of her lungs and lymph nodes.\n\nIn another case, a 44-year-old man developed chest pain after playing hockey in 2012. Doctors found mesothelioma in the lining around his lungs. The man regularly used talcum powder after showering, as well as dousing his hockey gear with talc before donning it.\n\nTalc-free powders\n\nIt's hard for consumers to judge on their own whether a specific brand of talcum powder is safe, Moline said.\n\n\"The question is where does it come from and how rigorously has it been tested,\" she said. \"There are some mines that don't have any asbestos, but it's unclear whether those are being used by different manufacturers.\n\n\"The most prudent thing for folks is either to use talc-free powders, which are on the market, or cornstarch-based products,\" Moline concluded.\n\nThe new study was published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "A new study has found a link between talcum powder contaminated with asbestos and a rare and deadly cancer, after 33 people developed the disease after \"significant exposure\" to the powder.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9390/a2f5b2e73a764d398bdec7c787cfb7b0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
