No way, she told me, when we discussed the scorching result, Rare Beasts, this week. 'I felt quite strong, because of the baby.'\n\nPiper's daughter, Tallulah, is now nine months old. But at that stage of her pregnancy, she was blessed with 'this weird sort of clarity'.\n\n'It's only my experience but there's a sort of calm stage, where you really hold your s*** together, because you're thinking about the baby. Filming while feeling like that was really empowering!'\n\nPiper, 37, who won every award going for her magnificent performance in Yerma at the Young Vic two years ago, also wrote the screenplay for Rare Beasts.\n\nShe plays Mandy, a thirtysomething single mother who writes for a production company. The character has a young son and tricky parents who are divorcing.\n\nWhen we first meet her, she's on a date with Pete (a lively Leo Bill) who's mean when he's hurt \u2014 and he's feeling hurt pretty much all the time.\n\n'All the characters are at the end of their rope,' Piper said \u2014 and they're all facing rejection.\n\nPiper (pictured) was pregnant when she was shooting that scene but smart camera angles disguised this. She said she's pleased the film wasn't made seven years ago, before #MeToo took off\n\nWhen people are rejected, they do awful things and behave in a beastly way. We can be appalling as human beings, and that can often be both terrible and quite funny.'\n\nBill's Pete is a piece of work. He finds women intolerable but tells Mandy he can't live without one.\n\n'This isn't even an anti-romcom,' Piper said, laughing. 'It's way beyond that.'\n\nOn-screen chemistry: Billie Piper alongside David Thewlis in Rare Beasts, her directorial debut\n\nScreen dream: Billie Piper in her new film which includes a dazzling cast: Kerry Fox and David Thewlis play Mandy's estranged parents and Lily James is her friend\n\nMaybe that's why I loved it. Rare Beasts is the flip side of the industrial Hollywood studio romance. I can see how Piper's heightened film will polarise people; and so can she. Folk were divided when it was shown at the Venice Film Festival; and there will surely be dissenters when it's unveiled at the BFI London Film Festival next Thursday, and shown again the following day and on October 13.\n\nThe film has a top cast: Kerry Fox and David Thewlis play Mandy's estranged parents, Lily James is her friend. But Piper is worried the language may be too coarse for some tastes. 'I'm from a working-class family and there's a brutal shorthand,' she said.\n\nShe started writing the screenplay when she turned 30. The world was telling women 'that we can have everything'. So why were she and her friends so 'angry and stressed'?\n\nRare Beasts is the flip side of the industrial Hollywood studio romance and it is clear how Piper's heightened film will polarise people\n\nThe film is filled with characters who are each experiencing rejection in some way and Pipe is interested in how people can 'often be both terrible and quite funny' when this happens\n\nThere's a scene where she and what she calls her 'Greek chorus' of women chant: 'Love and respect myself!' She borrowed that from therapy sessions she attended, which also included 'tapping' \u2014 where you tap your vital meridians and use positive affirmations \u2014 which didn't work for her, though many of her friends swore by it. 'We're constantly looking for ways to support our mental health,' she said.\n\nNot everything in Rare Beasts is autobiographical. There are no cameos from ex-husbands Chris Evans and Laurence Fox; and I didn't spot her beau, Johnny Lloyd, though he might be in there somewhere.\n\nPiper (pictured) won every award going for her magnificent performance in Yerma at the Young Vic two years ago and wrote Rare Beasts when she turned 30 years old\n\n'There are a number of things in there that I have never experienced,' she insisted. 'One that springs to mind is the undressing scene,' she said, referring to a sequence where her character, Mandy, bares all for the aforementioned Pete.\n\n'The confused feminism . . . when she undresses in front of him . . . I promise, I've not done that! She's trying to be this reclaimed feminist, and she keeps misjudging it. She's trying to be in control of this sort of pre-sex scene.\n\n'Her intentions are: 'No, don't you undress me. I'll do it, thanks. And I'll be in control of my body.' Then it ends up being way off the mark.'\n\nPiper was pregnant when she was shooting that scene but smart camera angles disguised the fact.\n\nShe said she's pleased the film wasn't made seven years ago, before #MeToo took off.\n\nThe film will be unveiled at the BFI London Film Festival next Thursday, and shown again the following day and on October 13\n\nThere have been, she acknowledged, 'some glaring improvements' since then. But it's also left a lot of men feeling 'quite terrified'. She said she wished men and women could 'have more frank conversations' on the subject.\n\nThat's where Rare Beasts comes in. It's provocative and deliciously dangerous, and I hope people check out Piper's potent voice \u2014 and then argue about it.\n\nShe tells me she'd like to repeat the experience of directing her own work (though she's unlikely to direct anyone else's).\n\nShe is spotted in ivory white sling-back style heels and oriental coat during the 67th Venice Film Festival in Venice, on August 30\n\nIn the meantime, she's starring in a new TV series, co-written with Lucy Prebble, called I Hate Suzy, due out next year.\n\n'This having-it-all thing is an unhelpful message,' she sighed. 'You can try. But something will be compromised. And to not acknowledge that is not helpful.\n\n'I'm mindful that I'm trying to do all of that at the moment; and I think I need to make sure I keep an eye on it.'", "description": "BAZ BAMIGBOYE: Billie Piper shows the flip side of Hollywood romance in her directorial debut of Rare Beasts.
