Elizabeth Warren on Monday announced a plan to crack down on misconduct by judges that would allow the reopening of an investigation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nMs. Warren, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, said it was time to strengthen the ethical integrity and impartiality of the federal judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to ensure that judges do not hear cases where they have conflicts of interests, strengthen our nation\u2019s ethics rules for judges, and ensure accountability for judges who violate these rules,\u201d the Massachusetts senator wrote in a statement describing her proposals.\n\nShe wants to give more power to judicial watchdogs to investigate judges and to impose penalties, such as stripping them of their federal pensions.\n\nThe rollout of the plan coincided with the opening of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2019 session. She named several judges that deserved more ethical scrutiny and singled out Mr. Kavanaugh, who is a popular target of liberal activists over unproven allegations of sexual misconduct in high school and college.\n\nUnder Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, investigations into judicial misconduct could continue even when a judge resigns from office or is elevated to the Supreme Court. Current rules shield judges and justices from further investigation once they ascend to higher benches.\n\nShe said the measure would allow the judiciary to reopen investigations of Mr. Kavanaugh and others who benefited from protection.\n\nMs. Warren also wants to establish a code of conduct for high court justices, as exists for lower courts.\n\n\u201cWhen Judge Kavanaugh was elevated to the Supreme Court, 83 ethics complaints that had been lodged against him were dismissed \u2014 and because the Supreme Court is not covered by a Code of Conduct, no procedure exists to file new complaints,\u201d Ms. Warren said.\n\nThe plan also would beef up ethics rules:\n\n\u2022 Prohibit judges from deciding for themselves whether they should recuse from a case due to a conflict.\n\n\u2022 Ban judges from owning or trading individual stocks.\n\n\u2022 Require Supreme Court Justices to provide written explanations of recusal decisions when a litigant challenges for recusal, which is not now required.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
