As you can imagine, with the heat of the fire, and also because at that time we were entering into summer, there was a risk fungi and parasites could damage the weaving,\u201d Le Moine said.\n\nThe tapestry has only been on public display twice in the past 30 years. It will be open to public view at the Mobilier National during Paris\u2019 European Heritage Days on Sept. 21-22.", "description": "An ornate tapestry woven in the early 1800s and rescued from Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral after a massive fire in April is going on public display for only the third time in recent decades.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429512295&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1WM", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
