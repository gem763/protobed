On Tuesday morning, Airbus stock was priced on the French CAC-40 at just over 119 euros per share.\n\nBy comparison, Boeing's current share price is $372 and has risen nearly 16% year-to-date.\n\nThe researchers believe Airbus's range of jet planes \"should outgrow\" Boeing's by 2024, aided by the U.S. planemaker's frustration over its grounded 737 Max plane as well as challenges getting its new 777X into commercial service.\n\nBarclays believe Airbus's \"more mature\" product range would guarantee smoother income and free cash flow could triple from 3 billion euros in 2018 to around 9 billion euros in 2024.\n\n\"The cash flow profile at Airbus is now becoming more predictable and robust compared with that of Boeing,\" the bank said.", "description": "Analysts at Barclays have put a price target of 155 euros on Airbus, claiming the stock looks brighter than ever.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105339870-1531998343735belugaxl-firstflight-1-.jpg?v=1531998703", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
