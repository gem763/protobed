They voted 438 to 20 at the final \"third reading\" stage.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson insisted an election was needed to break the Brexit deadlock in Westminster, after MPs backed the deal he agreed with Brussels but demanded more time to debate it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the country to come together and go forward. It will be a tough election but we will do the best we can,\u201d he said after a meeting of the backbench 1922 that followed the result of the vote.\n\nThe bill will now head to the House of Lords where it is expected to pass through all its stages tomorrow, before parliament is dissolved on November 6.\n\nJohnson told the Commons on Tuesday afternoon: \u201cThere is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless, willful, fingers-crossed, 'not me, guv' refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people, and that is to refresh this parliament and give the people a choice.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn had previously said his MPs would block a December election, but changed his mind after pressure from other opposition parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get out there on the streets. In every town and village in this country, Labour will be there, giving a message of real hope where this government offers nothing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 10 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip last month after rebelling against the party line on Brexit were welcomed back into the parliamentary party on Tuesday night. It means those who want to remain MPs will be able to stand in the election as Conservative candidates.\n\nTory Chairman James Cleverly said after the result of the vote: \u201cEveryone is quite fired up. Every election is a gamble. If it\u2019s not a gamble it\u2019s not an election.\"\n\n\u201cThere are circumstances that force you into a particular position. And the current maths in the House of Commons means that we\u2019ve got to have a general election and actually once that decision has been made by circumstance it\u2019s quite liberating.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Boris Johnson says a new parliament is needed to get Brexit done.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Chris Hanretty"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177995774-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
