They\u2019re brave, they\u2019re boisterous, they\u2019re going to give Ben a run for his money.\u2019\n\n\u2018With Ben, it\u2019s 100 miles per hour all the time. At the moment, things are starting to take off again, things are nice with Ballum. \u2018Martin\u2019s just come back to the Square which is leverage for Ben to create this whole new drama.\u2019\n\nBut what about Martin? Is this the end for him? Time will tell\u2026\n\nEastEnders continues tonight at 8:30pm\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Martin Fowler left for dead as Ben Mitchell takes revenge\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Pam Coker unites Ben Mitchell and Callum Highway as Lin Blakley calls for full return\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Ben is set to leave Martin for dead tonight, after the stall owner set him up and got him arrested earlier in the week.", "authors": ["Anna Paul"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18660799-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-060d_1572021177.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
