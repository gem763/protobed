Illuminating paraffin is also expected to climb by 21 cents. The only positive out of the latest figures is 93 octane which is showing a decrease of three cents a litre,\" the AA said.\n\n\"The average landed price of fuel dropped across the board during August. If the Rand/US dollar exchange rate had remained flat, we could have been looking at a drop of up to 30 cents a litre for diesel and nearly 52 cents for petrol. Unfortunately, continuing Rand weakness means that prices will increase instead,\" it added.\n\n\n\nIt called for policy stability to encourage greater currency stability, saying there were \"encouraging noises\" coming from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, but that these should \"lead to concrete action\".\n\n\" Our concern is that an ever-weakening Rand robs motorists of the opportunity to benefit from lower oil prices,\" the AA said.\n\nCompiled by Marelise van der Merwe", "description": "Weakness in the rand is expected to drive a fuel price spike in September, the Automobile Association has said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/277/97faad8cd35f4eaa9faf7df24f86748d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
