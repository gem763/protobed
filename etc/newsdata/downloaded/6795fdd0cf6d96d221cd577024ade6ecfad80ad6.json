Antara Foto/Puspa Perwitasari/ via REUTERS\n\nThe Southeast Asian country is the world\u2019s biggest producer of the edible oil and is often vilified abroad for the destruction of forests to make way for plantations, and for the fires that are often started to clear the land.\n\nWhile Indonesia\u2019s neighbors complain about the impact of the smoke drifting in, the criticism at home, where the smoke is usually much more severe, has been more muted.\n\nBut that might be changing, if the reaction to a government campaign launched to support the palm oil industry is anything to go by.\n\n\u201cWe plant palm to fulfill Indonesia\u2019s needs, including to develop biodiesel and to lift Indonesia\u2019s hopes,\u201d the cheery Good Palm campaign said on its Twitter account - @SawitBaikID.\n\nBut the campaign, launched by the government and the state Palm Crop Estate Fund agency, could not have come at a worse time.\n\nFires, at their most serious since 2015 because of an El Nino weather pattern causing an extended dry spell, have been sending clouds of acrid smoke up over Sumatra, parts of Borneo islands and beyond for more than a month.\n\nThe government, once again trying to deflect the anger of its neighbors, has sent in more than 9,000 workers to try to beat down and douse the flames.\n\nThe smoke, or haze as it is known, has forced schools and airports to shut, while tens of thousands of people have suffered from respiratory problems.\n\nIn one widely reported case, a four-month-old girl from a haze-hit village on Sumatra island died this week. Doctors said she bore signs of lung infection, though they have yet to give the official cause of death.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop using the \u2018palm oil is a very productive crop\u2019 card to justify their negligence on the poor management of existing palm oil plantations,\u201d wrote one Twitter user - @agnarendra.\n\nPUT OUT THE FIRE\n\nSheany, a journalist based in Bali, who uses only one name, said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d that the authorities were launching their campaign to make palm oil look good at this time.\n\n\u201cSo many Indonesians living in those areas are choking,\u201d she said.\n\nIn another sign of changing attitudes toward palm oil, some supermarkets in the capital, Jakarta, have begun displaying products with \u201cpalm oil-free\u201d labels, to the anger of government officials.\n\nDono Boestami, head of the Palm Crop Estate Fund, defended the campaign to support palm oil, noting the \u201chuge contribution\u201d it makes to the economy.\n\nAuthorities say fire has scorched 328,000 hectares (810,000 acres) of land since January but it is not clear how much of that has been to make way for palm plantations.\n\nGreenpeace Indonesia said 80% of cleared forests had been turned into become palm and pulpwood plantations.\n\nReferring to the Good Palm campaign, Greenpeace called for tighter controls of the palm oil industry.\n\nEnvironmentalists say poor farmers are often blamed for the fires when the plantation companies egg them on, knowing they can expand later into land that has been cleared.\n\nPolice say many of the fires are started in forest and scrub next to plantations, which are often untouched.\n\nThe chairman of Indonesia\u2019s palm oil association, Joko Supriyono, said the companies should not be blamed for fires they do not start.\n\n\u201cThere are reports from our members that fires on their concessions were because of widespread fires outside of the concessions,\u201d he told foreign correspondents on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo has not responded directly to the backlash. This week, he attended Islamic prayers for rain in an area shrouded in heavy haze.\n\n\u201cWe have done everything we can, but the correct way is to prevent this from ever happening. Whenever there\u2019s a fire, it should be put out,\u201d Widodo said in a statement.", "description": "Indonesia is facing a backlash over an online campaign backing palm oil at a time when forest fires, often linked to slash-and-burn land clearance, have spread choking smoke across the region, raising growing concern about damage to health.", "authors": ["Gayatri Suroyo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431169796&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0NA", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
