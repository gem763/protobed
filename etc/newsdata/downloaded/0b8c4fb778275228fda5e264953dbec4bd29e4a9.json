Newsweek\u2019s tweet promoting the story was retweeted less than 500 times but fetched a whopping 5,000 responses as of this writing.\n\nTrump ate the last pancake? Impeach! \ud83d\ude06 \u2014 Mark Dice (@MarkDice) September 16, 2019\n\nNo not STOLEN PANCAKES https://t.co/gudx1xnT2D \u2014 Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) September 16, 2019\n\nMy mouth has been ajar for a solid 60 seconds. The scoop: Trump was on 2008 vacation at late MOTHER\u2019S former home, took pancakes his COUSIN cooked without saying thank you.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe WH did not immediately respond to Newsweek\u2019s request for comment regarding the allegation of theft.\u201d https://t.co/xAiQjUZzmy \u2014 Ryan Basford (@RyanBasford) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cHe was here one morning I was busy making pancakes and he had forgotten my husband had died,\u201d she said. \u201cHe put a few pancakes in [his] pocket and never said \u2018cheerio\u2019 or anything.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo one on the planet believes this, yet @Newsweek found it fit to print. https://t.co/J7UUxU902I \u2014 John Cardillo (@johncardillo) September 17, 2019\n\nHoly s\u2014, I can\u2019t believe this isn\u2019t satire. Newsweek actually ran a story about Trump stealing pancakes from some far removed cousin at a family event like anyone gives a sh*t. This is the pettiest thing to ever petty. https://t.co/qTSdHowj7a \u2014 Mindy Robinson \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@iheartmindy) September 17, 2019\n\nI feel like people at Newsweek and The NY Times overdosed on stupid pills this week. Seriously?? Someone decided this was news? Stole PANCAKES??! Are you kidding me?? What\u2019s next? Trump steals pens? Trump steals printer paper?? Ya\u2019ll are beyond stupid. https://t.co/tVXRV02gbL \u2014 Ned Ryun (@nedryun) September 17, 2019\n\nTHIS IS NOT A POLITICAL TWEET: But is this really how bad Newsweek is now? Stealing pancakes?
