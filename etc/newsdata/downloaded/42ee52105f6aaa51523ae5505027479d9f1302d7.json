At the same time, depending on the context\u2014the person\u2019s relationship to you and the reason behind the question\u2014what these people are asking, even if the words sound similar, might be very different. There\u2019s also a difference between a private conversation with a friend, a group conversation at a party, and an encounter with a relative at Thanksgiving. These differences matter, because they\u2019ll help you to figure out how to respond.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the various intentions behind these questions. First, most people don\u2019t mean harm when they bring up babies. It\u2019s usually a matter of being tone-deaf, unaware that they\u2019re raising a topic that for many feels intensely private and for some feels intensely fraught. They may toss out the question as if they\u2019re asking something on par with \u201cHow\u2019s the new job going?\u201d rather than \u201cHow much money do you make?\u201d In particular, people of an older generation or a more traditional cultural background might automatically equate marriage with babies, so for them, they view this question as nothing more than casual small talk or perhaps an expression of support and interest: I\u2019m so excited for you in this new chapter of your life! What\u2019s next?\n\nThen there are those who have a better sense of how personal this is, but ask from a place of care. While this question is hard for you, someone who asks about your personal life may be trying to create intimacy and build a friendship with you; if you automatically react by coldly shutting down the conversation, you may also be shutting down the possibility of growing closer with this person. For instance, some people who become parents do so through adoption or surrogacy, so even though you might explain why pregnancy isn\u2019t for you, they may ask more questions\u2014not because they\u2019re nosy, but because this helps them understand more about you: Do you not want to be pregnant, or not want to be a parent?\n\nIf becoming a parent is important to those who ask, or their experience of raising their children has been fulfilling, they may struggle to understand your decision, or worry that you\u2019ll be missing out on something, or wonder whether you\u2019ll change your mind and regret your choice. Sometimes, too, because \u201cNo babies for us\u201d is so vague, people might assume that you want to be parents but are having fertility issues. In these situations, people may ask more questions because they experienced fertility issues themselves and want to pass along information about what worked or offer support for you.\n\nIn all of these scenarios, the thing to remember is that the questions you get aren\u2019t meant to irritate you. For the most part, they reflect the beliefs, desires, and experiences of the people asking. In other words, their questions are more about what parenthood means to them as they try to understand what it means for you. Given the variety of reasons that a person might be asking these questions, one way to handle them is to reply, in an open, curious tone, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d", "description": "What I do, or don\u2019t do, with my uterus is nobody\u2019s business.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/baby_question_Final/facebook.jpg?1572232866", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
