Senior US diplomats told The Post that the May meeting between Trump and Orban \"solidified\" Trump's views on Zelensky.\n\nNeither Putin nor Orban directly encouraged Trump to press Ukraine for damaging information on his political opponents, the officials said, nor did they push the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about Ukraine's involvement in efforts to undermine him during the 2016 election.\n\nRead more: How Rudy Giuliani went from a respected federal prosecutor and beloved NYC mayor to Trump's bag man\n\nTrump's relationship with Ukraine has come under scrutiny in the wake of a whistleblower complaint filed in August, which detailed concerns that Trump had pressured Ukraine to aid him politically by investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son on allegations of corruption. The complaint centers around a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; the White House has since released a summary of the call.\n\nThe Zelensky phone call has since become the launching pad for Democrats in their impeachment inquiry.\n\nUS officials stressed to The Post that while Putin and Orban have slammed Ukraine, Trump's decision to press Zelensky to investigate his political rival stemmed from the president's \"own impulses\" and the views that were pushed by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has acknowledged that he was enlisted to work with the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.\n\nGiuliani was mentioned 31 times in the whistleblower complaint and was described as a \"central figure\" in White House efforts to pressure Ukraine. Federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani's bank and business records in connection with two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who worked with him in Ukraine.\n\n'All roads lead to Putin'\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin.

Mulvaney added that Trump told him that he believed Ukraine was a \"corrupt place\" and that he didn't want to \"send them a bunch of money.\"\n\nAnd House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week said that she and Trump got into a heated argument during a White House meeting, in which she told the president that \"all roads lead to Putin.\"", "description": "According to The Washington Post, Trump's conversations with the leaders of Russia and Hungary reinforced his view that Ukraine was a corrupt country.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a0722ce35876e01018b5727?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
