Even politicians are human too.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris is the latest Democratic presidential candidate to put her foot in her mouth. At a rally on Sept. 6, a man in attendance asked Harris: \u201cWhat are you going to do in the next one year to diminish the mentally retarded action of [Trump]?\u201d The prosecutor-turned-candidate laughed, and replied \u201cWell said.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cretarded\u201d is generally seen as offensive to those with mental handicaps or learning disabilities. But let\u2019s be honest: It\u2019s something we\u2019ve all said at some point. It's not the end of the world. All Harris had to do was apologize and move on.\n\nInstead, she is trying to gaslight America.\n\nAfter facing backlash for laughing along with the slur, Harris issued a flat-out denial. It's a lie.\n\nShe said \u201cit was not something that I really heard or processed,\u201d and that \u201cYou would think that in the year 2019, people would have a much better understanding how hurtful a term like that can be.\u201d The candidate said she would \u201cnever condone that kind of language being spoken by anybody about anybody.\u201d\n\nWhen my staff played the video from my town hall yesterday, it was upsetting. I didn\u2019t hear the words the man used in that moment, but if I had I would\u2019ve stopped and corrected him. I\u2019m sorry. That word and others like it aren\u2019t acceptable. Ever. https://t.co/mNmo1hyNpW \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 7, 2019\n\nThis is an obvious and bald-faced lie, from a candidate who has been full of them ever since her elevation to the U.S. Senate.\n\nWatch the video: It\u2019s all on tape. The man\u2019s words are clear and loud, and Harris can obviously hear him. She smiles and laughs, responding \u201cwell said.\u201d She literally doesn't even start laughing until after he says the word \"retarded.\" No one is buying her shameless denial.\n\nDuring a rally, a voter referred to Trump's actions as \"mentally retarded\", prompting @KamalaHarris to laugh and say, \"well said, well said.\"\n\n\n\nI hate amplifying content I know the right will seize on and twist for their own hypocritical gain, but this hurts my heart. #CripTheVote pic.twitter.com/aVQWtLFw30 \u2014 Kendally Brown (@kendallybrown) September 7, 2019\n\nThis is what makes Harris such an inauthentic, unappealing candidate and politician. Her draconian record as a prosecutor is bad enough on its own merits, but she adds hypocrisy to the mix, making everything so much worse. She is a calculating, merciless hack, willing to even cover up exonerating evidence and keep innocent people in prison or in criminal jeopardy just to feed her own political ambitions. Now add that to her constant flip-flopping on issues such as the role of private insurance under \"Medicare for all\" \u2014 she implied she did not support a bill she herself co-sponsored \u2014 and then this latest lie.\n\nFrankly, Harris is so incredibly dishonest that it\u2019s exhausting to keep track.", "description": "We\u2019ve all made mistakes: Said the wrong thing, smiled at an inappropriate time, or laughed at a cruel joke we probably shouldn\u2019t have found funny.
