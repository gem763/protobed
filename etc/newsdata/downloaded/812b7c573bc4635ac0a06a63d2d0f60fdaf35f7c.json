Chinese buyers would like the discretion to buy based on market conditions.\n\n\"China does not want to buy a lot of products that people here don't need or to buy something at a time when it is not in demand,\" an official from a Chinese state-owned company explained.\n\nIf U.S. agricultural products \"enter China in a concentrated way, it might be hard for the domestic market to digest,\" the Chinese official added.\n\nOversupply of agricultural products in China would hit local prices really hard, he said, \"and break the supply-demand balance.\"\n\nMoreover, a massive outbreak of African swine fever has decimated the pig herd in China, battering demand for soybeans, a key feed ingredient and the biggest agricultural import from the United States.\n\nChinese agricultural buyers, representing a mix of state and private enterprise, typically import from the cheapest source. The U.S. demand that China commit to buying a huge volume of products, regardless of whether they were economical or in demand, would require state intervention to be implemented.\n\nThat contradicts a core demand the United States is making of China in the current trade war, and a U.S. policy goal for decades: that China become a more market-based economy and stop subsidizing state companies and favoring local firms at the expense of foreign competitors.\n\nThe upside-down nature of the situation is striking, some trade experts say.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government doesn\u2019t normally regulate the pricing or timing of ag exports -- a private sector role -- but in this case the president has already taken this step,\u201d said Miriam Sapiro, former acting U.S. Trade Representative under Barack Obama and advisor to president Bill Clinton, now a senior vice president at Sard Verbinnen.\n\n\"It is ironic that China is pushing back, saying 'We want the market to address this,'\" said Nicole Lamb-Hale, a former assistant secretary of Commerce and a managing director at Kroll, a risk management firm.\n\nThe hefty agricultural purchases Trump is asking for are market distortive, Lamb-Hale said. China is telling Trump they are \"just not feasible.\"\n\nAsked specifically about concerns that the administration's push for big agricultural buys contradict the longer-standing U.S. free trade message, a White House spokesman said: \"The president has been clear that he wants real structural changes that yield actual, verifiable, and enforceable results, leading to fairer trade, more efficient markets, and increased prosperity for both countries.\"\n\nCommerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters on Oct. 17 that China would \"increase U.S. farm purchases based on domestic demand and market principles, while the U.S. would provide favorable conditions.\"\n\nU.S. farmers watched their exports plummet after the trade war started.\n\nA U.S. administration official said Tuesday that the two sides might not agree to a \"Phase One\" deal by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Chile in mid-November.\n\nIn recent weeks, China has purchased large amounts of soybeans from Brazil, after prices of U.S. soybeans jumped as investors bet on big China buys.\n\nGraphic: China agriculture product imports from the United States, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6901/6883/ChinaAgImportsSince2000.png", "description": "In U.S.-China talks, Beijing's refusal to spell out farm buys is big sticking point", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T06P-OCABS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
