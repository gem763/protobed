It\u2019s the latest frontier in the nation\u2019s ongoing \u2014 and, in recent years, horrifically violent \u2014 reckoning with the statues, troubling testaments to the country\u2019s racist past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening in all sorts of places,\u201d said Adam Domby, a history professor at the College of Charleston who is writing a book about Confederate monuments. \u201cStill, it\u2019s clearly in many cases being used as a stopgap because the laws prohibit removing them.\u201d\n\nAtlanta installed markers next to four of the city\u2019s most prominent Confederate monuments in August. Officials in Decatur, Ga., placed a sign near a Confederate monument this month. Come October, three such markers will go up in downtown Franklin, Tenn. Cities including Savannah, Ga., and Richmond are weighing proposals to contextualize their monuments in a similar manner, according to the Atlanta History Center, which maintains an online database tracking the fate of Confederate monuments.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com History Theres-New-Way-Deal-With-Confederate-Monuments-Signs-That-Explain-Their-Racist-History"], "top_image": ""}
