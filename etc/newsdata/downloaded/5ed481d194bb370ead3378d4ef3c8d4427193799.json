The Irishman's UFC comeback was announced in Moscow, and a three-fight return would, according to him, culminate there in 2020.\n\nThe former two-weight UFC world champion was ostensibly on a promotional visit to the Russian capital, but took the opportunity to declare that he would be back in the octagon on January 18 in Las Vegas to face an as yet unnamed opponent. From there, McGregor is eyeing the winner of the Nate Diaz versus Jorge Masvidal \u2018BMF\u2019 bout, before moving on to a blockbuster rematch against UFC lightweight ruler Khabib Nurmagomedov in the Russian's backyard later in the year.\n\nREAD MORE: 'We will settle it, once and for all': Conor McGregor announces UFC return and vows to face Khabib Nurmagomedov again (VIDEO)\n\nIt was typically audacious and ambitious stuff from McGregor as he reveled in being the center of attention in the homeland of Nurmagomedov, with whom animosity still simmers more than 12 months after they faced off in Las Vegas.\n\nBut amid all the brash statements of intent from McGregor, it feels as if now more than ever he stands at a crossroads in his fighting career. If his Moscow plans pan out as \u2018Mystic Mac\u2019 has foretold, then they will ensure a glorious second act in a cage career that has already ensured he will go down as a legend of the sport; if they don\u2019t, and if McGregor's return falls flat or is frustrated by not getting his way with the UFC, it could mean he slinks off in bitterness and resentment, his second coming falling short of what he has prophesied.\n\nFor now at least, one thing is for certain: to stand any chance of making his dream 2020 scenario a reality, McGregor, 31, has to get back into the octagon at the earliest opportunity. We\u2019ve been here before with his unilateral declarations of a return \u2013 one came in September when he tweeted that December 14 in Dublin was the date and location he was aiming for, before that was shot down by UFC boss Dana White.\n\nAlso on rt.com Conor McGregor press conference: Watch former UFC champion address the media in Moscow during Russia visit\n\nOn this latest occasion, the UFC have indicated that they are \u201ctargeting [January 18] for Conor\u2019s return, but that no deals are even close to being signed.\" Lightweight rival Donald \u2018Cowboy\u2019 Cerrone, among the most realistic opponents for that date, has hinted on social media that the fight will be made, but beyond that there is nothing cast-iron.\n\nStep one of the plan must happen at the time outlined by McGregor for either of the remaining two components to fall into place \u2013 and that\u2019s assuming he wins on his return, which is something he hasn\u2019t done for three years. That last happened when McGregor gained \u2018champ champ\u2019 status with victory over Eddie Alvarez at Madison Square Garden in November 2016, a second-round TKO victory sealed with a crunching combination initiated by McGregor\u2019s notorious left hand.\n\nThat peak \u2013 as high as it was \u2013 looks increasingly in danger of being McGregor\u2019s summit inside the octagon. Since then we have seen a hugely lucrative detour into boxing against Floyd Mayweather, followed by a comprehensive defeat to Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 in October 2018.\n\nDana White\u2019s recent comments that McGregor \u201cisn\u2019t the man anymore, Khabib is\u201d were unsurprisingly met with a spite-filled response from the Irishman. But White was merely stating a reality which McGregor \u2013 based on his social media musings \u2013 is struggling to come to terms with. While once he undoubtedly laid claim to the moniker, McGregor should know as well as anyone that three years without a victory cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, qualify someone as being \u2018the man\u2019 in fighting terms.\n\nAlso on rt.com Khabib brands McGregor 'alcoholic' & 'rapist,' Irishman labels UFC champ 'a p*ssy' in ugly war of words\n\nMcGregor\u2019s trip to Moscow will have acted as a timely balm to soothe any bruises to his ego that were left by Dana White\u2019s comments. The Irishman was mobbed by fans wherever he went, feted by members of the local press and found time to make a charismatic appearance on the nation\u2019s leading late-night talk show.\n\nWhile he veered into toxic territory with some of his comments about Nurmagomedov and his Dagestani homeland \u2013 causing one man to direct at bottle at him \u2013 McGregor was unstinting in his platitudes and charm offensive towards Russia. Of course he has his whiskey wares to peddle, but it was also an attempt to have a pop at Nurmagomedov, trying to drive an ethnic wedge between him and some Russian fans. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the man represent Russia in my life,\u201d McGregor proclaimed at one presser. Khabib\u2019s father and trainer Abdulmanap even poured scorn on the Russian press for what he saw as complicity in McGregor\u2019s insults.\n\nMcGregor\u2019s remarkable gift in the past was to back up his braggadocio in the octagon. He talked the talk, but he also walked the walk \u2013 or rather, strutted the billionaire strut. Even in defeat against Mayweather, he basked in the glory of pulling off an implausible bout and emerging with his reputation enhanced \u2013 and no shortage of cash in the bank.\n\nBut much changed when he was choked out by Nurmagomedov so comprehensively in that fourth round in Las Vegas. On that occasion, the Dagestani was the one who did exactly what he said he would, putting an exclamation mark against their rivalry. Done and dusted in the Nevada desert.\n\nNurmagomedov's star has since risen further. He has attended to business by beating interim title holder Dustin Poirier in their unifier at UFC 242 in Abu Dhabi, and is next most likely to meet longtime rival Tony Ferguson in March or April of next year, potentially in New York. He is a bona fide global megastar who boasts an appeal to the Muslim world in particular. He is the more reserved yin to McGregor\u2019s brash, trash-talking yang. He can draw the crowds, and has the fighting record and champ status to \u201ccall the shots\u201d regarding future opponents, just as Dana White says.\n\nNurmagomedov has said that from a fighting standpoint, he has proved all he needs to prove against McGregor. But, tantalisingly, he has left the door ajar for a rematch, admitting in St. Petersburg earlier this month that a McGregor re-run would make financial sense. The Eagle has not always risen above McGregor\u2019s social media barbs either, sometimes swooping in to land insults, just as he did when McGregor took issue with Dana White\u2019s comments.\n\nAlso on rt.com Khabib vs McGregor 2: UFC lightweight champ says Russian rematch makes financial sense, would be record-breaker\n\nOf course, a lot must happen for a rematch to take place as McGregor wishes. Opponents must be confirmed, victories must be taken, and McGregor must regain the focus and fire that some fear he has lost given the riches he has amassed from his fighting career and his business endeavors. There is also the significant issue of his assault charge for allegedly attacking a man in a Dublin pub earlier this year and, according to reports in The New York Times, two sexual assault cases against him in his Irish homeland.\n\nREAD MORE: UFC star Conor McGregor named in second sexual assault case in Ireland \u2013 reports\n\nBut for McGregor, Moscow this week was testament that he remains a major draw, even on what should really have been enemy territory. He used his Russian trip to state his intent to restart his career, and he plans for that to come full circle in Russia next year.
