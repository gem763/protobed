(AP) - It looks like something from a science fiction movie.\n\nA newborn two-headed timber rattlesnake has been found in New Jersey\u2019s Pine Barrens. The snake has two brains and each head acts independently of the other.\n\nTwo employees of Herpetological Associates of Burlington County spotted the reptile in a nest where a timber rattlesnake was giving birth late last month.\n\nCEO Bob Zappalorti tells NJ Advance Media it\u2019s the only two-headed timber rattlesnake ever found in New Jersey. He says it likely wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in the wild because its head could get snagged on something.\n\nHerpetological Associates will care for the snake.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: NJ Advance Media.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It looks like something from a science fiction movie.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
