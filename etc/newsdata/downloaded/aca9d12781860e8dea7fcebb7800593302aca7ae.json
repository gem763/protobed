SANRAL as well as other research institutions will be part of the long-term performance protocol,\u201d said managing director Deane Koekemoer.\n\n\n\nRead also: This is what the N2 and N3 will look like after a R28 billion revamp\n\n\n\nThe plastic road will be watched to gauge its performance under South Africa\u2019s unique weather conditions, which can range from extremely hot temperatures in summer to freezing cold in winter.\n\n\u201cIn South Africa, all asphalt produced runs through a number of stringent testing methods... and this plastic asphalt is no exception,\u201d said Koekemoer.\n\nJust how far 200 tons of plastic asphalt goes on a road depends on the thickness it is laid, which is in turn determined by road specifications.\n\nThe recycled plastic is generated from local waste plastic and supplied buy a local recycling plant and the binder was manufactured in South Africa.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The recycled plastic is used as a binder ingredient in the asphalt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9186/f4bdcb480b2a454ca4736248f9b76d33.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
