Volker testified Thursday before members of three separate House committees. He also turned over text messages between himself, diplomats in Kyiv and others involved with Ukraine, including Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who played a major part in the administration's dealings with Kyiv.\n\nIn the several pages of messages released by the Democratic leaders of the committees, U.S. diplomats discussed setting up the July 25 telephone call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky that has been central to the impeachment investigation into whether Trump should be removed from office.\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Friday. (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nIn one of the texts, a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine said he thought it was \"crazy\" to withhold military aid for the country as it confronted Russian aggression.\n\nIn the Sept. 9 text, after news that the Trump administration had been withholding military assistance for Kyiv, William Taylor, the U.S. charg\u00e9 d'affaires in the Ukrainian capital, discussed the importance of the message Washington was sending to Kyiv.\n\n\"With the hold [the delay in delivering the military aid], we have already shaken their faith in us,\" Taylor said in a text message to Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\n\"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said in another text.\n\nSondland responded that he believed Taylor was wrong about Trump's intentions, saying Trump had wanted to withhold the aid over concerns about corruption in Ukraine. In a text, he denied that there was a \"quid pro quo,\" linking assistance to Ukraine to whether Zelensky agreed to investigate the Bidens.\n\nVolker resigned last week after he was named in the whistleblower complaint about the Trump administration and Ukraine that prompted the House's Democratic leader, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to announce the start of a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\n'An obligation to end corruption': Trump\n\nTrump froze nearly $400 million in U.S. military assistance to Ukraine shortly before speaking to Zelensky, prompting accusations from Democrats that he had misused U.S. foreign policy for personal gain.\n\nTrump asked Zelensky in that call to investigate former vice-president Biden and his son Hunter. Hunter Biden sat on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma from 2014 to 2018, a time period that includes the final two years of his father's second term as U.S. vice-president.\n\nTrump has described the call with Zelensky as \"perfect,\" while most Republicans have blasted the impeachment investigation as partisan politics.\n\nAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption! \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nCongress must not back down from our duty to defend the Constitution as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a> ignores the Founders\u2019 warnings about foreign interference at every turn. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TruthExposed?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TruthExposed</a> \u2014@SpeakerPelosi\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump tweeted that he had an \"obligation to end corruption, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time.\"\n\nHe repeated that message on the importance of rooting out corruption on the White House lawn with reporters Friday, but when asked if he's asked foreign leaders for any probes that don't involve political rivals, Trump said, \"you know, we would have to look,\" before quickly changing topic to repeat some of the allegations he's levelled at the Bidens.\n\nTrump did confirm a report he would send a letter to Pelosi requesting that the chamber hold a full vote to formally approve the inquiry, a move that could slow the process down.\n\nPelosi earlier in the day said on Twitter: \"Congress must not back down from our duty to defend the Constitution as @realDonaldTrump ignores the Founders' warnings about foreign interference at every turn.\"\n\nKurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, leaves after Thursday's closed-door interview with House investigators, as House Democrats proceed with the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump. (Jose Luis Magana/The Associated Press)\n\nRepublicans said late Thursday the evidence Volker presented fell far short of a \"quid pro quo,\" and they have also seized on Atkinson's characterization in a report that the whistleblower had \"possible political bias.\"\n\nRepublicans have keyed in on Joe Biden's central role in helping remove a top Ukraine prosecutor while his son was in place on the Burisma board. But Viktor Shokin's ouster in 2016 came after months of pressure from a number of entities, including the EU and the International Money Fund. Shokin was viewed by many in the West as not doing enough to confront Ukraine's longstanding political corruption issues.\n\nIn Ukraine on Friday, General Prosecutor Ruslan Ryaboshapka said he had \"no such information\" with respect to alleged wrongdoing by Biden's son.\n\nOfficials in Ukraine have repeatedly said there were inquiries into possible corruption involving Burisma and its owner, but they occurred during a 2011-2012 period that predates Hunter Biden's board appointment.\n\nNevertheless, Ryaboshapka said his office would review 15 previous investigations related to the founder of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, and whether probes were conducted properly during the time frame Zlochevsky served as a minister in a previous government.\n\nChina allegations involves investment fund\n\nOn Thursday, Trump said that China should also \"start an investigation into the Bidens.\"\n\nTrump's appeal was particularly striking given that Washington and Beijing are locked in a bitter trade war and are due to have another round of talks in the U.S. next week to address their issues.\n\nTrump has alleged that Hunter Biden got China to invest $1.5 billion in a fund he was involved in soon after accompanying his vice-president father on a trip to Beijing in December 2013.\n\nChina foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said earlier this week that the allegations concerning Hunter Biden and Chinese government business were \"totally groundless.\"\n\nCNN reported on Thursday that Trump brought up not just Biden's name but that of fellow Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren in a June 18 phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what was discussed about the candidates.\n\nWarren said on social media that \"the public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi.\"\n\nWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated. \u2014@MittRomney\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah, one of the few Republicans to periodicially criticize Trump, said the president's rationale for asking China \"strains credibililty.\"\n\nWhile Trump has pushed for a thorough investigation into the Bidens, the White House has thrown up roadblocks and denied access to documents and witnesses requested by Democrats in Congress, as well as New York State prosecutors looking into allegations concerning potential campaign finance violations by the Trump campaign, whether the president is improperly profiting from his businesses while in office and for access to his income tax statements.", "description": "A top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine thought it was \"crazy\" to withhold military aid for the country as it confronted Russian aggression, according to evidence presented Thursday in an impeachment probe of President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309135.1570206621!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
