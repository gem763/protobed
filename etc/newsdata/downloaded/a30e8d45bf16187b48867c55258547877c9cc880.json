This is particularly true now that they\u2019re World Series bound for the first time in franchise history.\n\nAnd while there are plenty of baseball reasons to explain why the Nats are a better team this season than in the past, the meme era really isn\u2019t as into logic as it is LOLs.\n\nThe past couple weeks have seen plenty of people on social media making Bryce Harper jokes \u2014 including us here at Yahoo Sports. But something happened Tuesday to make us wonder if even the Washington Nationals are getting their Bryce jokes off.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBehold this tweet and video that the Nats released before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. It seems like a harmless hype video that a team would release before a game that could lead to a World Series berth for the first time in Expos/Nationals history.\n\nThe part of this to pay close attention to is, \u201cWe want to bring a title back to DC.\u201d Seems like an earnest enough goal. But if you remember pro athlete gaffes, you\u2019ll remember what happened during Harper\u2019s introductory news conference with the Philadelphia Phillies last spring.\n\nStory continues\n\nBryce: \"We want to bring a title back to D.C.\" Oops. pic.twitter.com/4ygJdukIon \u2014 Jake Russell (@_JakeRussell) March 2, 2019\n\nIs this just a coincidence? Maybe. But is anything really a coincidence these days in brand Twitter?\n\nSo if this was a moment of fan-service for the Nats fans who are reveling in their October charge, the fans got it and appreciated it. Just look at some of the replies:\n\nThat tweet was bryceless \u2014 James H. (@pack2pack91) October 15, 2019\n\nSo even if the whole thing were just a coincidence, the Nats are still winning in their fans\u2019 eyes, but they also have plausible deniability. That\u2019s what makes it a good tweet.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at mikeozstew@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
