Your kidneys do a miraculous job of finding them in your blood, removing them, and excreting them in your urine. Without this vital process, toxins would build up in your body and damage your other organs.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just toxins. You have a delicate alkaline/acid balance in your body, and too much on either side of the pH scale can have dangerous consequences.\n\nWho manages that balance? Your kidneys.\n\nBut your kidneys aren\u2019t bulletproof. They\u2019re vulnerable to toxic overload if you don\u2019t protect them. You\u2019d get worn out too, if you spent every second of your life filtering away hazardous substances.\n\nWhy your kidneys need your help\n\nThere are three types of serious kidney disease\u2014most are preventable and many reversible if addressed and corrected in their early stages. Like many of life\u2019s ailments a healthy diet, exercise and social engagement can help prevent kidney disorders from getting a toehold in your body.\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most common kidney disease. The kidneys become less effective over time, often showing no symptoms until the disease has taken hold. Patients may then experience numbness or swelling in the hands and feet, frequent urination, nausea, anemia, and poor appetite.\n\nDiseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:\n\nType 1 or type 2 diabetes\n\nHigh blood pressure\n\nSmoking\n\nProlonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones, and some cancers\n\nVesicoureteral reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys\n\nRecurrent kidney infection\n\nCertain medications, particularly NSAIDs (painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen)\n\nThe Mayo Clinic tells us that the most important causative factor is high blood pressure. You and your doctor should work together, using dietary and other lifestyle changes to help lower your blood pressure and prevent kidney damage. If those don\u2019t help, and your blood pressure remains too high, CKD can lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD).\n\nEnd stage renal disease occurs when CKD reaches an advanced stage and is as serious as it sounds. Your kidneys are pretty much shot\u2014permanently damaged and barely functional. Diabetes is the most common cause of ESRD. High blood pressure is the second most common cause. Other problems that can cause kidney failure include:\n\nAutoimmune diseases, such as lupus and IgA nephropathy\n\nGenetic diseases (diseases you are born with), such as polycystic kidney disease\n\nUrinary tract problems\n\nDaily dialysis or a kidney transplant are the only options.\n\nAcute kidney failure (ARF) is when your kidneys abruptly stop working because of an injury or ingesting toxic substances. ARF may respond well to treatment, if it\u2019s treated early and the kidneys are not severely damaged. If there aren\u2019t any other problems, your doctor may recommend changes to your diet, the use of medications, or even dialysis. In some cases, the kidneys can actually heal themselves\u2014no intervention needed.\n\nKidney cancer isn\u2019t common, but we\u2019re seeing it more frequently. There are few early symptoms. But as the cancer progresses, patients may experience blood in the urine, on-and-off fevers, fatigue, back pain, and weight loss.\n\nKidney cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation, and assorted drugs, depending on its location, size, type, and the overall health of the patient.\n\nKeeping your kidneys healthy\n\nStart by asking your doctor for blood panel readings of your BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels and your eGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) numbers. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.\n\nTest Testing For Healthy Results BUN Kidney and liver function 10-20 mg/dl\n\nHigher indicates kidney problem BUN/creatinine ratio Kidney efficiency 10-20:1\n\nHigher ratios OK in men and older people eGFR Kidney damage Greater than 60 mg/min\n\nScores from these tests tell you how strong your kidneys are now. But again, beware\u2014kidney diseases can be symptom-free. A healthy score doesn\u2019t mean you can go merrily on your way.\n\nBut you can be reasonably merry if you\u2019re wary\u2014and help your kidneys keep clean of junk. Remember, some toxins are 100% unavoidable, but sticking to a predominantly healthy diet and lifestyle are your first line of protection for these vital organs.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do the same for your other heroic detoxifier.\n\nKeep your liver clean and it returns the favor 1,000 percent\n\nThe liver is your largest internal organ, with a to-do list that\u2019s more than 500 functions long. Need to send some iron, folate, vitamins A, D, and B12 out to do their jobs? Ask the liver. Need some hormones activated, or other vitamins, minerals, carbs, or protein put on standby for when they\u2019re needed? The liver mans the switches.\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the liver\u2019s main job\u2014nonstop detoxing. Everything you eat has to drop in to visit the liver as your food begins its journey through your body. Unfortunately, so much of today\u2019s foods include countless damaging toxins: heavy metals, pesticides, pathogens, and so on.\n\nThe liver is the bouncer at the door, sorting out and throwing out bad visitors, like parasites and viruses, while helping good visitors find their healthy ways from ingestion to digestion to distribution to elimination as waste.\n\nBut as with your kidneys, too much can just be too much. And disease lies in wait.\n\nHepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver. You can catch it if you drink water or eat food that\u2019s been contaminated with the stool of someone with the virus. You can also catch it by eating raw shellfish from water that has the virus in it or by having unprotected sex with someone infected with the virus.\n\nHepatitis A can be extremely unpleasant but is rarely dangerous. Almost everyone who gets it makes a full recovery, usually without medical intervention.\n\nHepatitis B has a far nastier side. If untreated, it can cause liver scarring, liver cancer, liver failure, and death.\n\nBut, like hepatitis A, your body can fight off this disease on its own. Your doctor might prescribe bed rest.\n\nThat said, if you think you\u2019ve been exposed to the virus, get to a doctor as soon as possible. The earlier you get treatment, the better. The doctor will give you a vaccine and a shot of hepatitis B immune globulin. This protein boosts your immune and helps it fight off the infection.\n\nHepatitis C is also a virus that attacks the liver. It gets there the same ways as hepatitis A and B: direct contact with infected body fluids, typically through injection drug use and sexual contact, contaminated food and drinks.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nOnce in the liver, Hep C impedes its detoxification processes. That\u2019s an open door for invaders that a healthy liver would get rid of. Pathogens running amok means significant inflammation, the precursor to nearly all liver and other diseases.\n\nHepatitis C calls for special caution among Baby Boomers. Because, until 1992, routine blood screenings for injections and blood transfusions couldn\u2019t spot the hepatitis virus. What was considered safe turned out not to be.\n\nThe CDC called hepatitis C a \u201csilent epidemic\u201d affecting some 3.5 million Americans\u201475 percent of whom are Boomers. They don\u2019t know when or how they got it, and have no symptoms to warn of impending trouble. But it seems certain that hundreds of thousands of them who had blood transfusions, unsafe sex, or shared needle use prior to 1992 are very much at risk and should be tested right away.\n\nAs with threats to your kidneys, many liver diseases remain in hiding, symptom-free, for years, emerging at full strength only when it\u2019s far more difficult, if not impossible, to treat than when they originated.\n\nBut there is good news. Working as a team, you, your kidneys, and your liver can slow or stop nearly every kidney and liver disease early in its tracks.\n\nHow to practice kidney and liver safety\n\nHere are reliable, safe, and effective ways to keep your liver and kidneys functioning at full strength.\n\nWork up a sweat\n\nSweating does a lot more than cool you off. It provides one more avenue for the excretion of toxins. Where and how you sweat isn\u2019t important. Steam room, sauna, exercise or workout\u2014all are fine.\n\nBut what\u2019s best is exercise. The right workout works wonders for your overall good health. In fact, many physicians are coming to realize that exercise is one of the top three health makers, along with a healthy diet and an active mental and social life.\n\nNow throw in the fact that your fat can be home to up to 100 times more toxins than in your blood. Working up a sweat that burns fat washes those toxins right out of your life. And gives your cardiovascular and circulatory systems a healthy workout at the same time.\n\nBe sure to drink plenty of fresh, filtered water before, during, and after sweating, to aid in excretion and prevent dehydration.\n\nSkin brushing\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t believe how much waste and toxins are excreted through the pores in your skin every day. Would you believe it\u2019s up to two pounds? Yup, that\u2019s the magic number. Skin brushing has been done for centuries, to help that cleansing along. Even back then, our ancestors realized that glowing skin and complexion went hand in hand with brushing.\n\nThat\u2019s because in addition to brushing away those toxins, vigorous skin brushing removes the old, dead skin cells, actively and thoroughly, instead of letting them sit around all day while they slowly fall away.\n\nBrushing also gets your circulation going, helping your skin \u201cbreathe\u201d easier. And what a great, tingly feeling! Good medicine!\n\nEat to keep your acids and bases in balance\n\nYour healthy body depends on a delicate balance of acidity and alkalinity. Your lungs and kidneys ordinarily manage that balance nicely. But when they\u2019re overloaded, there can be too much or too little of one or the other. The result is acidosis.\n\nSymptoms differ depending on whether your lungs or your kidneys are at their limits, but some shared acidosis outcomes include:\n\nFatigue, sleepiness, drowsiness\n\nTiring easily\n\nConfusion\n\nShortness of breath\n\nHeadache\n\nWe can literally eat away the causes of acidosis, and ease the burdens on our livers and lungs at the same time. The Standard American Diet is the key\u2014it\u2019s got to go. All of the unnatural, unhealthy, processed food? Replace it with a Mediterranean style diet: try to buy local and organic when you can. Avoid processed foods in favor of foods rich in healthy oils (i.e. olive, avocado), stick to low or no added sugar or salt, and enjoy a few servings of organically-raised or grass-fed meats and wild fish (3 servings/week). Use the Mediterranean diet as your model. Wonderful things will happen.\n\nYou can test your acidity level to find out whether or not you\u2019re overly acidic. Just purchase some pH test strips and add a few drops of saliva or urine. The strips will come with a color-coded scoring system to tell you where you fall. Scores over 7.4 mean you\u2019re acidic and need to get back in balance by consuming some alkaline foods and beverages.\n\nJuice fasting\n\nThis is one of the simplest, most effective, and delicious favors you can do for your liver and kidneys, as well as your digestive system.\n\nNow, don\u2019t go thinking fasting is too hard or it\u2019s just for monks in the mountains seeking enlightenment.\n\nAll you have to do is go for one day, for starters, with no solid food\u2014only juice. Talk about a break for your detoxers. A whole day without piles of food banging on their doors every minute? Wow.\n\nStart with one day and see how you feel. If you feel fine, indeed, as most people do, you can go for up to 3 days.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you should swap out your food for store-bought, sugar-sweetened fruit juices. I\u2019m talking about freshly made juices\u2026from a masticating or centrifugal juicer.\n\nYou can juice just about all fruits and vegetables. Here\u2019s just one recipe many people fall in love with\u2014a delicious combination of kale, spinach, parsley, cilantro, or other organic greens. Of course you can experiment with your own combination of juices or find plenty of other recipes online.\n\nFasting not only detoxes, but you get a great bonus benefit\u2014Fasting two to four days at a time every six months causes stem cells to awake from their normal dormant state, and start regenerating\u201d These tiny miracle workers specialize in organ repair\n\nAnother benefit? Studies with lab animals show that the ones that fast intermittently live longer than those that eat normally.\n\nKeep your frontline defenders in fighting shape\n\nYour kidneys and liver depend on you\u2014help them help you.\n\nThat\u2019s taking good care. Go for it, for a healthy, happy life.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
