Do Something.\u201d\n\nThe Connecticut GOP hosted O\u2019Keefe for what was called an \u201cEvening of Enlightenment.\u201d The undercover investigator reviewed his decade-long career devoted to exposing corruption and abuse of power in government, teachers\u2019 unions, the media, and big tech.\n\nCongrats to @Project_Veritas and @JamesOKeefeIII for uncovering an interstate double voter in NH and for helping get the felon prosecuted! #voterfraud https://t.co/9pmC7pW0yU \u2014 Voter Integrity (@VoteChecker) October 25, 2019\n\nO\u2019Keefe, the author of American Pravda, poked fun at some of the accounts of his anticipated arrival in Connecticut.\n\nThe headline of the Journal Inquirer\u2019s lead story on October 18, read, \u201cGOP Speaker Panned: Creator of Deceptive Videos Invited by State Party to Fundraiser.\u201d The Inquirer reported:\n\nConnecticut Republicans have invited James O\u2019Keefe, a self-styled investigative reporter with a reputation as a trickster for producing deceptive hidden videos, to headline an event Thursday, and Democratic leaders are criticizing the selection. Reputable news organizations, including the Washington Post, have said that O\u2019Keefe\u2019s practices are intended to dupe viewers and embarrass subjects through deception and manipulation.\n\nAccording to the Inquirer, former Connecticut lieutenant governor and current Connecticut Democrat Party Chairwoman Nancy Wyman denounced the state GOP for extending the invitation to O\u2019Keefe.\n\n\u201cThe Connecticut Republicans should be ashamed to be hosting James O\u2019Keefe at a Shelton fundraiser next week,\u201d Wyman said, according to the report.\n\nShe added:\n\nHow ironic that in an era when the Republican President (Donald Trump) complains about fake news, the state party invited the greatest practitioner. Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s staged encounters that are secretly recorded and deceptively edited have been proven false and misleading, and they ruin reputations.\n\nThe investigator, however, laughed off the insults, boasting instead of the \u201chundreds\u201d of news outlet retractions that grace the wall of his office.\n\nBREAKING: @CNN President Jeff Zucker rushed to his waiting car outside of the #CITIZENCNN event yesterday in NYC; Zucker avoided answering @Project_Veritas questions on @realDonaldTrump threat to sue the network citing #ExposeCNN.

Romano told Breitbart News that \u201cif Democrats aren\u2019t complaining, I\u2019m not doing my job.\u201d\n\nIn response to many in the state who have rallied against the Democrats\u2019 addition of more taxes and fees on citizens, as well as the possibility of tolls on state roads, Romano said:\n\nUnfortunately, in the state of Connecticut, the Democrats don\u2019t see residents as anything but a revenue source, and so whatever they can do to raise revenue, they\u2019re going to do, whether it\u2019s tolls, whether it\u2019s grocery tax, you\u2019re just a way to fund government to them.\n\nRomano said, \u201cPeople need to hear the Project Veritas stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s value in what Project Veritas does, in terms of power and government accountability \u2013 it\u2019s something that we need,\u201d he said.\n\nO\u2019Keefe began his presentation by taking his audience back to his first big investigation when he was only 24, living with his grandparents, and had only a YouTube account to his name. Wearing his grandmother\u2019s fur jacket, he and 20-year-old Hannah Giles posed as a pimp and a prostitute and exposed ACORN, a taxpayer-funded social justice organization of grassroots groups that worked for voter registration, housing, and other social issues in low-income communities.\n\nO\u2019Keefe reflected that, after just one week of releasing videos that bared the corruption in ACORN, the Democrat-controlled Congress passed a bill to defund the organization and President Barack Obama signed it into law.\n\nToday, Project Veritas is taking on tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Pinterest, and, most recently CNN. But, things are a bit different now.\n\nNEW: Tech Insider Blows Whistle on How Pinterest Listed Top Pro-Life Site as Porn, \u201cBible Verses\u201d Censored #LifeCensored (See full story: https://t.co/mzMipyy02N) pic.twitter.com/scyNxBfJIV \u2014 Project Veritas (@Project_Veritas) June 11, 2019\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 YouTube has REMOVED our Pinterest Insider story \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 The battle is on \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 SUPPORT the insider who leaked the documents and got fired HERE: https://t.co/FLBzuLE65R pic.twitter.com/zWLfW2leRQ \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) June 12, 2019\n\nWhile once O\u2019Keefe needed to go undercover into the targeted organizations himself, now whistleblowers are contacting him, asking him for help to expose corruption and abuse in their companies.\n\nSome of the whistleblowers, in fact, now work for Project Veritas, including Eric Cochran, who exposed Pinterest. Both Cochran and Cary Poarch, who exposed CNN recently, spoke to Republicans in Connecticut and urged them to do the same, attesting that O\u2019Keefe and his team will back them up.\n\n\u201cThis is the future,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said to his audience. \u201cOur heroes \u2026 are not TV pundits, they\u2019re brave citizens who find themselves in circumstances where they have to make a difference.\u201d\n\nPointing to Cochran and Poarch, O\u2019Keefe added, \u201cThere are hundreds of people like these two, and we\u2019re gonna find them, and we\u2019re gonna give them hidden cameras, and if you\u2019re lying, cheating, stealing, doing something corrupt, you may just find yourself to be the next unwilling internet celebrity.\u201d", "description": "James O\u2019Keefe of Project Veritas urged more government and media whistleblowers to come forward as he addressed the Connecticut GOP.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/James-OKeefe-Wave-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
