(CSE: REO) (\"REO\" or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement (the \u201cBuyout Agreement\u201d) with its Executive Chairman, Mr. Vincent Gueneau, to acquire his 5% ownership interest in the Company\u2019s 95%-owned subsidiary Kainji Power Holding Limited (\u201cKPHL\u201d). A Special Committee of REO\u2019s Board of Directors comprising of only independent directors negotiated the terms of the Buyout Agreement and recommended the transaction to the Board. Under the Buyout Agreement, REO will pay Mr. Gueneau a consideration of approximately US$1.2 million comprising a mix of 50% cash in instalments and 50% REO common shares, representing 13.3 million shares to be issued at C$0.06 per share (the \"Transaction\"). In an earlier transaction (see News Release dated June 26, 2019), REO had increased its ownership in KPHL from 60% to 95%.\n\n\n\nMr. Lewis Reford, Chief Executive Officer, stated \"KPHL is currently REO\u2019s most important subsidiary, holding our investment in Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited (\"Mainstream\"), and moving to 100% ownership confers streamlining efficiencies and clarity to the Company\u201d. Mr. Reford added, \"The consideration REO paid highlights the base value we place in KPHL of approximately US$24 million. KPHL owns approximately 4.0% of the shares of Mainstream which implies a net operating capacity of 37MW.\u201d\n\nThe Transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2019. Any securities issued under the Transaction are subject to a four month hold period and restrictions on transfer under Canadian securities law and Canadian Securities Exchange policies.\n\nThe Transaction is considered to be a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 \u2013 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\u201cMI 61-101\u201d). The Transaction is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 in reliance on the exemptions set forth in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as neither the fair market value of the Transaction, nor the fair market value of the consideration for the Transaction, insofar as it involves interested parties, exceeds 25 per cent of the Company\u2019s market capitalization.\n\nThe Transaction is expected to close within 21 days of the date hereof. The Company did not file a material change report more than 21 days before the expected closing of the Transaction as the details of the Transaction and the participation therein by related parties of the Company were not settled until shortly prior to closing and the Company wished to close on an expedited basis for sound business reasons.\n\nEarly Warning Disclosure\n\nPrior to completion of the Transaction, Mr. Gueneau beneficially owned 36,000,000 common shares and exercised control over 88,800,000 common shares (held through Kappafrik Management DMCC (\u201cKMGT\u201d)), representing approximately 25.94% of the Company's 481,047,377 issued and outstanding shares on an undiluted basis.\n\nImmediately after the completion of the Transaction, Mr. Gueneau will beneficially own and control a total of 135,300,000 common shares (46,500,000 common shares held in Mr. Gueneau\u2019s personal name and 88,800,000 common shares held through KMGT), representing approximately 27.37% of the Company's 494,347,377 issued and outstanding common shares on an undiluted basis.\n\nMr. Gueneau intends to hold his REO common shares for investment purposes. Although Mr. Gueneau does not intend to acquire further common shares of the Company at this time, he may choose to do so as market conditions warrant.
