A nose changing shape in such a way could only be achieved through surgery rather than contouring.\n\n\"The cost of a Rhinoplasty procedure depends on many different physiological factors, the techniques used and the surgeon - however typically range from \u00a36,000-\u00a310,000.\n\n\"It's also possible that Kris has had more than one Rhinoplasty as the nose does appear slightly thinner in recent years.\n\n\"Occasionally, patients find the desired result was not achieved and feel they need another operation. Multiple rhinoplasty procedures are not recommended as it can result in the nose being made weak and also a build-up of scar tissue can cause breathing restrictions in the nostrils.\n\nNeck lift\n\n(Image: WENN.com)\n\n\"Kris has spoken openly in the past on an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians around having a neck lift.\n\n\"The scarring following the procedure is normally hidden around the back of the ear to keep it discrete.\"\n\nUplift and Implants\n\n\n\n\"Kris Jenner has spoken openly about having a breast enlargement in the 80's, and later had these implants replaced.\n\n\"It\u2019s possible that Kris Jenner had an Augmented Matopexy \u2013 more commonly known as an uplift with implants. This procedure can typically range from \u00a36,500 - \u00a38,000.\"\n\nNon-Surgical\n\n\n\n\"It is possible that Kris has had the non-surgical treatment of Dermal Fillers to her cheeks often referred to as \u201ccheek fillers\u201d. Dermal fillers can be used in this area to re-introduce structure and volume along the cheek bone just like in Kris\u2019s case.\n\n\"For many other women fillers are used to plump up skin sections as plumpness can be lost with the natural ageing process that both men and women go through.\n\n\"The procedure replaces soft tissue whilst filling in wrinkles/skin folds. Fillers can range in price depending on the area and amount used - between \u00a3150 - \u00a3500 per session.\n\n\"I believe that Kris may have undergone the non-surgical treatment of fillers to her lips as she appears to have slightly fuller lips compared to previous images.\n\n(Image: \u00a9 www.splashnews.com)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"The provider has ensured her lips still appear extremely natural and in proportion to the patient\u2019s facial features.\n\n\"The average cost of lip fillers in the UK can range depending on the provider and the amount of filler used, however, you can expect to pay anything from \u00a3200 - \u00a31000 per treatment.\n\n\"Kris\u2019s eyes appear brighter and her eyebrows slightly lifted \u2013 usually pointing towards the non-surgical treatment of anti-wrinkle injections (also known as Botox).\n\n\"Kris has most likely had Botox to her forehead and glabella (in between the eyebrows) as you can see she has a smooth forehead, lifted eyebrow arches and a limited frown/expression.\n\n(Image: instagram)\n\n\"The treatment normally lasts between 3-6 months and as muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to reappear and need to be treated again.\n\n\" The procedure can give the appearance of smoother skin if you are after a youthful appearance or can be used as a preventative measure to slow the process of getting wrinkles.\n\n\"I believe Kris will regularly receive these non-surgical treatments to maintain her youthful appearance along with a healthy diet.\"", "description": "Kris, now 63, looks like a different woman to the one who debuted on Keeping Up with the Kardashians more than a decade ago", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Backgrid", "Getty Images", "Wenn.Com", "Www.Splashnews.Com", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13825212.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Celebrity-Social-Media-Photos.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
