He\u2019s taught me a lot of things about running a great retail business, and it\u2019s totally different to a gold mining business. Then we collect some other friends from the gym and have breakfast.\n\nJake Klein ordered the fruit plate and a flat white. Brook Mitchell\n\nDo you run marathons?\n\nI\u2019ve run marathons, ultra marathons and triathlons. I grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, when the country had to invent sports that it could be a champion at. So it has these crazy long races like the 90-kilometre Comrades Marathon.\n\nWhat do you do for breakfast?\n\nUsually a bowl of cereal at home. Special K and a bit of All-Bran with skim milk.\n\nWhat time do you have your first coffee?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs soon as I get to work, around 8.10. It\u2019s an eastern suburbs coffee: a large three-quarter skim flat white.\n\nDo you have a second cup of coffee?\n\nYes, whenever my wonderful EA goes out. It\u2019s usually a piccolo, about 10am.\n\nAre you a fan of breakfast meetings?\n\nI do them occasionally. I\u2019m more a fan of coffee meetings.\n\nIf you have lunch at your desk, what do you have?\n\nA poke bowl with salmon. Or sushi and salad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow often do you travel?\n\nI do a lot of travelling; that\u2019s just in the nature of the mining industry. I used to go to China every six weeks. I go to each of our five mine sites probably once a quarter. There\u2019s one in NSW, one in Western Australia and four in Queensland, one of which is run by Glencore.\n\nWhen you\u2019re at remote mines, what happens to your exercise routine?\n\nI try to exercise. I\u2019ve run in some great places. This job has given me opportunities to visit these country towns and meet amazing people. The thing about the gold industry is it takes you to places where you\u2019d pay to go on holiday. We did these road shows in New York and London. It\u2019s a privilege to be able to travel to these cities and have a run in the morning, or meet people.\n\nCan you find your large three-quarter flat white out at the mines?\n\nNo, you can\u2019t. One of the things I suggested to general managers on our sites is that good coffee would make a better morning. So most sites do have a pod machine or an espresso machine.\n\nDo you ever have times when you feel stressed or overwhelmed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thing that gives me the biggest stress is people decisions. And you can never avoid them. We talk about having honest and courageous conversations at Evolution, and that means both ways. People need to say what\u2019s on their mind. Evolution hasn\u2019t got there yet but I am convinced it\u2019s the pathway to building a great company.\n\nWhen you\u2019re away, do you have breakfast in the hotel?\n\nUsually, although I think it\u2019s the biggest rip-off of hotel stays.\n\nDo you have any food vices?\n\nOnly coffee. And I think my kids and wife would say my exercise is a bit of a vice. Later in life I might think maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that every day.\n\nThe bill\n\nBambini Trust, St. James Trust Building, 185 Elizabeth St, Sydney.\n\nTwo strong flat whites: $10\n\nFruit plate: $16\n\nTotal: $26", "description": "Evolution Mining boss Jake Klein says his biggest vice is coffee, with exercise a close second.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_3%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8daf5c52d2561c0c7f61627ad1ae01ef76fcb306", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
