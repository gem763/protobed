Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is challenging Republicans who would vote against it to \u201cgo on the record.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that if the House of Representatives impeaches Trump and the matter goes to the Senate, she would want to \u201csee every Republican go on the record and knowingly vote against impeachment of this president, knowing his corruption.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez said any lawmakers who oppose impeachment should have the chance to put it to a formal vote \u201cso that they could have that stain on their careers for the rest of their lives, because this is outrageous to protect the amount of lawlessness.\u201d\n\nRep. Ocasio-Cortez on potential impeachment inquiry:\n\n\n\n\"I want to see every Republican go on the record and knowingly vote against impeachment of this president knowing his corruption, having it on the record ... because this is outrageous to protect the amount of lawlessness.\" pic.twitter.com/FCGzNeiccI \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 10, 2019\n\nOf the 235 Democrats in the House, CNN reports that there \u201care at least 134 who\u2019ve made clear they support starting the impeachment inquiry process, while some have gone further.\u201d\n\nIf an impeachment inquiry happens, it is expected to go beyond what was discovered in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe \u2015 scrutinizing Trump\u2019s \u201crole in hush payments to two women who said they had affairs with him and reports that he dangled pardons to officials willing to break the law to implement his immigration policies,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nDemocrats are also looking into whether Trump\u2019s resort properties have illegally profited from government business.\n\nThe main idea many Democrats are attempting to stress to the public is the president\u2019s corruption. Reps. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), both of whom support impeachment, explained the thinking to Politico this week.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller report has clearly been muddled and I\u2019m not sure that the public really has much of a concept of what that showed,\u201d Yarmuth said. \u201cAnd corruption is pretty easy to understand.\u201d\n\nRaskin said that \u201cpeople understand what it means for the president to be spending millions of dollars in federal government tax dollars at his own business properties.\u201d He later added: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to follow the money.
