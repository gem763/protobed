He agreed to sign with Werder Bremen when he turned 18 the following February and added three goals at the 2017 Under-17 World Cup, joining Freddy Adu in 2007 as the only Americans to play in both FIFA youth tournaments in the same year.\n\nHe scored in his U.S. senior national team debut against Bolivia in May 2018, making an audacious interception of a goalkeeper\u2019s pass over his head, at 18 years, 102 days the fourth-youngest American with an international goal. Then, on Dec. 7 against Fortuna Duesseldorf, he scored less than two minutes into his professional debut .\n\nSuccess came fast.\n\nAnd then his career stalled.\n\nHe made eight more substitute appearances, got his only start Feb. 22 against Stuttgart, then didn\u2019t play at all after coming on in the 84th minute against Mainz on March 30.\n\n\u201cWith the youth teams in growing up, I was always used to being one of the best players, always being one of the coach\u2019s favorites,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to go on the opposite side of that, yeah, it was pretty tough for me, I\u2019d say. \u2026 With my confidence, it kind of hurt a little bit.\u201d\n\nNew U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter picked Sargent for his training camp ahead of the CONCACAF Gold Cup rather than have Sargent make a repeat appearance at the Under-20 World Cup. But Sargent\u2019s form was off, an injury to Sebastian Llletget changed Berhalter\u2019s needs, and Sargent was cut from the 23-man roster for the tournament.\n\nSargent was angry and admits \u201cit took a few days for me to really calm down about the situation.\u201d He returned to his family in Missouri, went on vacation and reported to Bremen for the start of training on June 30.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not us making these decisions that can change the course of history. It\u2019s completely up to the player in how he responds and I would say Josh responded in the fashion that we\u2019d expect or we\u2019d want,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cHe was very motivated. He used the time to first rest and then attack preseason. \u2026 He realized that positions are fragile in soccer, that you have to work for every single thing you get and he went out there and earned himself playing time.\u201d\n\nSargent was on the field for only eight minutes in Bremen\u2019s first two games, started against Augsburg on Sept. 1 and gave Bremen a 2-1 lead in a 3-2 victory. He streaked into the penalty area and controlled Nuri Sahin\u2019s 30-yard pass over the defense with his right foot, chested the ball ahead, then used his right foot to loft the ball over Tom\u00e1s Koubek as he sprinted past the goalkeeper. As the ball was about to hit the ground, Sargent volleyed it into the open net with his right foot from 6 yards.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing to be honest is just my overall confidence and how good I feel about myself,\u201d Sargent said. \u201cI definitely feel a lot more a part of the team this year and having played in a few games already last season, I feel more comfortable on the pitch. \u2026 The life is good and the city\u2019s good, everything. I\u2019m in a happy place right now.\u201d\n\nSargent also scored for the U.S. in an October exhibition against Peru . He entered Friday\u2019s friendly against Mexico in New Jersey in the 67th minute for his eighth international appearance and was given the ball by star midfielder Christian Pulisic for a late penalty kick. Sargent was stopped by goalkeeper Jonathan Orozco to preserve the shutout in Mexico\u2019s 3-0 win.\n\n\u201cIt happens,\u201d Sargent said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to move on to the next one.\u201d\n\nBerhalter cautions Sargent that he already is at a high level and that pro soccer players need a thick skin.\n\n\u201cHow many guys are 19 years old and scoring in the Bundesliga?\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe saw it took a little bit of toll on him, but again, what I\u2019m focusing on now is how he used the summer, how he used disappointment to help his situation, and we\u2019re really proud of him for that.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Berhalter said Sargent, defender Tim Ream and midfielder Jackson Yuiell will start. Ream, like Sargent, played for the St. Louis Scott Gallagher club \u2026 Four of Friday\u2019s starters have returned to their clubs: Pulisic, goalkeeper Zack Steffen and midfielders Weston McKennie and Alfredo Morales. Injured defender John Brooks and backup goalkeeper Sean Johnson also have gone back to their teams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Josh Sargent's red hair could become as known in St. Louis as the Gateway Arch one day if he develops into an American soccer star.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/us_sargent_soccer_78943_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
