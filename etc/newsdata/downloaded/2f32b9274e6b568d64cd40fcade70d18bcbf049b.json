It had been through this last November, when a campaign for the pre-spring collection starring Jennifer Lawrence wearing clothes inspired by the Mexican escaramuzas did not go down well.\n\nThe company then addressed the issue specifically in the cruise collection, held in Marrakesh and done in collaboration with several African artists and artisans (that wasn\u2019t without controversy but was generally seen as a step forward). This time, the house thought it had acted better.\n\nBut none of that seemed to matter.\n\nThe campaign, which was for the latest version of Sauvage, a men\u2019s scent created in 1966, was called \u201cWe are the Land.\u201d It was shot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino and starred Mr. Depp as well as Canku One Star of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe .\n\nWhen Dior decided on the concept of the Sauvage ad (which follows a commercial made in 2015, when Mr. Depp joined the brand, that showed him on the open road in the West, doing similar sorts of soul-searching loner things), the brand reached out to an indigenous advocacy organization, Americans for Indian Opportunity , as advisers.
