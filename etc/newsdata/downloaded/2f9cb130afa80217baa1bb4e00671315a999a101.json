It was the latest sign of the growing outrage over a mystery oil spill that since early September has blighted a 2,200km stretch of some of the country\u2019s most beautiful beaches \u2013 and the failure of President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right government to handle the crisis.\n\nNobody knows where the oil is from or why it keeps washing up on Brazilian beaches. Yet while social media has been bombarded by videos of volunteers rolling up thick globs of oil in sand and putting them into plastic sacks, Bolsonaro sought to blame first Venezuela, then a \u201ccriminal action\u201d to scupper a major oil tender. He has repeatedly attacked environmental protection agencies as a \u201cfines industry\u201d and has yet to visit affected areas.\n\nOil contaminating Brazil's beaches 'very likely from Venezuela', minister says Read more\n\n\u201cThere is clear revulsion over the government\u2019s inaction,\u201d said Marcus Melo, a professor of political science at the Federal University of Pernambuco in the north-east. \u201cThe government has a certain myopia in understanding how serious this is.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Bolsonaro\u2019s vice-president Hamilton Mour\u00e3o announced that 5,000 more troops will be dispatched to help clean up the spill, but for many Brazilians the response was too little, too late.\n\nJoel de Oliveira Filho, 57, proprietor of a guesthouse on Carneiras beach \u2013 one of the most famous beaches in the north-east state of Pernambuco \u2013 joined other local residents who started cleaning up oil with help from city hall employees. Nobody from federal government was there, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople in the north-east are cleaning the oil from the coast with their own hands while the federal government is immobile,\u201d he said.\n\nIn nearby Bahia, volunteers organised the group Coast Guardians to clean beaches. It has 19,000 followers on its Instagram and has raised $4,800 online for protective gloves, boots and masks.\n\n\u201cThis is civil society getting organised. Our movement does not support any political party, we support nature,\u201d said Miguel Sehbe Neto, 37, a company administrator from Salvador who runs one of its 20 beach teams. \u201cWhat we want is an explanation and effective action.\u201d\n\nTheir team had help from naval personnel and environment agency staff when cleaning up two local beaches. But the government has not been able to map the slicks or stop them reaching the coast, he said \u2013 and many other beaches still need help.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People work to remove an oil spill on Suape beach in Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Pernambuco. Photograph: Stringer/Reuters\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the size of the enemy,\u201d he said.\n\nBolsonaro hosted a short Facebook live on Friday flanked by his defence minister, Gen Fernando Azevedo e Silva, and naval officers who explained they believe the oil came from a ship far out to sea.\n\nBolsonaro said containment barriers would not have stopped the oil as it was below the surface and suggested the spill could be a \u201ccriminal act\u201d to prejudice a multibillion-dollar, \u201cblockbuster\u201d auction of oil prospecting rights on 6 November.\n\n\u201cCould it be a criminal act to prejudice this tender? It is a question that is in the air,\u201d Bolsonaro said.\n\nThe environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has used Twitter to defend work by federal government environment agencies, state governments, the navy and state-run oil company Petrobras in dealing with the crisis.\n\nHowever, Fabiano Contarato, an opposition senator who chairs the Brazilian senate\u2019s environment committee, said the government \u201ccould have declared an environmental emergency [\u2026] They are not taking it seriously.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday he hosted a senate hearing with naval officers, environment ministry officials, prosecutors and the president of the environment agency, Ibama.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know if it was a deliberate crime, they don\u2019t know how to remove this oil,\u201d Contarato said. \u201cThere are many more questions than answers.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday federal prosecutors in the north-east ordered the government to put a national contingency plan into effect and said it had been \u201cinefficient and ineffective\u201d. But a judge ruled the plan was already operating and said the government was doing enough.\n\nJos\u00e9 \u00c1lvaro Mois\u00e9s, a senior professor of political science at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, noted that in April Bolsonaro\u2019s government closed two committees that were part of Brazil\u2019s national contingency plan for oil spills.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s position is against defending the environment,\u201d he said.", "description": "Mystery surrounds origin of pollution in north-east as president suggests \u2018criminal act\u2019 aims to scupper rights tender", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edbe375e9bd4cf0eca7fd2d22c468d4359e6c0a3/0_24_5402_3241/master/5402.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2365adbada24011f52d4cdfef9f579b7", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
