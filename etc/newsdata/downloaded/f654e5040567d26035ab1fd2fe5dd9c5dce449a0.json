Most of it has gone under the radar of American consumers, who have been largely oblivious to the way that China is able to censor free speech outside of its borders with the power of more than a billion wallets. Just over the weekend, California-based skate apparel brand Vans pulled a Hong Kong-protest-themed sneaker design from an online competition, largely seen as a move to avoid potential consequences in mainland China\u2014that news barely registered in the US.\n\nNow, China\u2019s attempt to force businesses to toe Beijing\u2019s ideological line has come to the NBA, after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressed his support for Hong Kong\u2019s protests in a now-deleted tweet on Friday (Oct. 4). The team\u2019s owner Tilman Fertitta quickly distanced himself from the sentiment. Many eagerly awaited to see whether the team and the NBA would follow the long-established playbook of brands bowing down to China, especially given that the franchise is the most-followed sports league in China. The Rockets, in particular, have a long relationship with the country because Chinese player Yao Ming\u2014now head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA)\u2014had played for the team.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests have been widely vilified in mainland China as a pro-independence movement marred by violent acts bordering on terrorism, rather than as a sustained series of protests against what many in the city see as Beijing\u2019s encroachment on the city\u2019s freedoms and worsening police brutality. A very small minority of people advocate for independence from China. Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, co-founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, said in a Facebook post that Morey\u2019s tweet was akin to supporting a \u201cseparatist movement,\u201d invoking events in Chinese history such as the Opium Wars and Japan\u2019s invasion of China to explain why the comments were so \u201cdamaging\u201d to the NBA\u2019s relationship with Chinese fans.\n\nChina\u2019s punitive response came quickly and predictably. The CBA, state broadcaster CCTV, and other partners said they would end cooperation with the Rockets, while the Chinese consulate in Houston warned the team to \u201cimmediately correct any mistakes.\u201d That further fueled speculation over whether the Rockets would go as far as to fire Morey in order to placate Chinese fans.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened yet. However, Morey today (Oct. 6) put out a tweet that was short of an apology, explaining that he did not intend to offend people in China.\n\nThe NBA said in its English-language statement that Morey\u2019s comments were \u201cregrettable\u201d and that they did not represent the views of the Rockets or the league, adding that it had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for China. Its Chinese-language statement, however, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Morey\u2019s views, and repeated the oft-used line that they had \u201cgreatly hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.\u201d\n\nThere was swift rebuke against the NBA\u2019s apparent cowing to China from all over the US, including many politicians\u2014Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro tweeted that America shouldn\u2019t be \u2018bullied by an authoritarian government\u201d and his opponent Andrew Yang called China\u2019s punishment of the Rockets a \u201cterrible move.\u201d Wisconsin congressman Mike Gallagher said Morey\u2019s willingness to speak up for Hong Kong was a \u201cgreat embodiment of the [league\u2019s] global social responsibility campaign.\u201d\n\nGallagher\u2019s statement hit at the heart of why so many are incensed at the NBA\u2019s response. Its commissioner Adam Silver last year said he was \u201cproud\u201d of the league being hailed as a model of progressiveness and \u201cwokeness\u201d in American sport, allowing its players to protest against police brutality in the US without repercussion, for example.\n\nThe latest spat with China puts the NBA in a position where it must navigate between being woke, and being a sports franchise with a massive global following and huge ambitions in China. Most brands have chosen to buckle under Chinese pressure in the past\u2014but the NBA has much more clout domestically and worldwide than a Vans or a Coach. How the NBA chooses to respond is arguably the most interesting and important test case of whether corporate America can push back against a growing campaign by Beijing to force brands around the world to bend to its will.\n\nSo far, pragmatism seems to have the upper hand. Rockets\u2019 players James Harden and Russell Westbrook said in Tokyo today (Oct. 7), where the team is playing exhibition matches, that they \u201clove China\u201d and that they apologize for Morey\u2019s comments.", "description": "A tweet by Houston Rockets' manager supporting the Hong Kong protests lands the NBA where many other US companies have been before\u2014in China's bad books.", "authors": ["Isabella Steger"], "top_image": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-07-at-12.22.25-PM.png?w=1400&strip=all&quality=75", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
