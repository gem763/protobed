In the biggest tragedy, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck in 2000 at the port of Dover.\n\n\u201cWe read with heavy heart the reports about the death of 39 people in Essex, England,\u201d the Chinese embassy said in a statement, adding further clarification was being sought with police.\n\nEssex police said their priority was ensuring dignity for the victims during their inquiry.\n\n\u201cEach of the 39 people must undergo a full coroner\u2019s process to establish a cause of death before we move on to attempting to identify each individual within the trailer,\u201d police added in a statement, saying that would be a time-consuming operation.\n\n\u201cWe might not have all the answers straight away.\u201d\n\nPolice have identified the truck driver as a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland and have searched three properties there as part of the investigation.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation identified the man as Mo Robinson from the Portadown area of the British province.\n\nThe trailer part of the truck arrived at Purfleet docks in Essex, southern England, having come from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge - as did the vehicle involved in 2000.\n\nFlowers are seen at the scene where bodies were discovered in a lorry container, in Grays, Essex, Britain October 24, 2019.

While they were able to rescue many of those smuggled in, Britain was perceived by organised crime as a potentially easy target for traffickers.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t turn the United Kingdom into a fortress. We have to accept that we have permeable borders,\u201d he told BBC radio.\n\nThe head of the Road Haulage Association said traffickers were \u201cupping their game\u201d and closer cooperation with fellow European nations was needed, albeit that may be complicated by Britain\u2019s potential exit from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThere is simply not enough being done in terms of security, in terms of the protection of vehicles across Europe,\u201d Richard Burnett told BBC TV.", "description": "The 39 people found dead in the back of a truck near London are believed to be Chinese nationals, police said on Thursday, as they questioned the driver detained on suspicion of murder.", "authors": ["Alistair Smout", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444507890&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N178", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
