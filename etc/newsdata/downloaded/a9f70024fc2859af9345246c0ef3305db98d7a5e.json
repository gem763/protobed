Now we\u2019re turning our Art Club into an interview series in which we catch up with the artists and designers we admire and find out what drives them.\n\nArtist Blake Kathryn\u2019s 3D dreamscapes have the power to transport viewers to another world \u2014 one of rich color palettes, glossy androids, and a neon-hued alternate reality. Her one-of-a-kind look has attracted clients like Adidas, Fendi, The New York Times, and Adobe. Most recently, she animated the visualizer for Lil Nas X\u2019s \u201cPanini,\u201d which currently sits at 47 million views on YouTube. Published on the evening before the release of his debut EP, her looping animations of slick cyborgs accompanied his second single after the success of \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d helping propel the notion that he\u2019s more than a one-hit wonder.\n\nKathryn studied at the University of Florida with the intentions of going into advertising, but she found herself attracted to studying graphic design. After graduating, a move to New York City jump-started her career, furthering her interests in the music industry and fine arts. After experiencing a polar vortex and dreaming of the sun, Kathryn made her way to Los Angeles, where she now takes inspiration from tech-free walks that eventually show up in the form of iridescent palm trees in her art.\n\nI spoke with Kathryn about her experience working with Lil Nas X, how she uses her subconscious as a resource, and advice for getting into 3D artwork.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhen did you first get into 3D and how did you go about learning?\n\nMarch 2015, I remember this so specifically as it was when the 100 Day Project was kicking off on Instagram. I promised myself to shake out of my vector-minimalist style leading up to this challenge. I was browsing old work a couple weeks ago and it\u2019s wild to see how rough those early days are. That being said, I went through a pretty common self-taught path: tutorial overload on Greyscalegorilla, YouTube, Eyedesyn, you name it. I fell so in love with the possibilities of breaking into a 3D canvas I never looked back and am happy to say it completely reshaped my career trajectory.\n\nYou focus a lot on creating these dreamscapes and worlds. What do you find the most satisfying about creating these?\n\nIf you\u2019re always living in your own head, sometimes it\u2019s nice to actualize said escapes. I\u2019ve always been a head-in-the-clouds daydreamer and am blessed with vivid dreams on the regular. That subconscious resource is nearly endless and so often the takeaways I latch on to are my surroundings. Nothing is ever quite right or grounded in reality. Trying to actualize those moments and bring them into a tangible medium is both very personal and therapeutic. Emotionally, the creative process feels similar to a comforting nostalgic memory, but it never really happened or went away.\n\nWhere do you pull inspiration?\n\nThe best inspiration always comes when I\u2019m not trying, which is a frustrating battle I hope to hack someday. My go-to methods are tech-free walks, browsing through books, sketching while decompressing at night, and going through any and all cinematography-heavy movies \u2014 classic or new.\n\nI absolutely love the work you did for Lil Nas X. What was it like working on that project? How did it come about?\n\nThank you! It was a wildly fast-paced ride. I think from the kickoff call to the final send-off was about three, maybe four days? In our initial chat, Montero [Lil Nas X] had a general overview of what he wanted the direction to be, and from there, had a generous level of creative trust in whatever vision I felt best conveyed that. It\u2019s such a blessing when you\u2019re able to collaborate with people that have that mindset. With the tighter deadline, I selfishly wish I had just a little more time to expand on a moment or two, but his fan base seemed really excited about what we came up with so my heart is very full. Also it only happened because I reached out on a Twitter thread! So hey, sometimes sharing your work cold-call style works.\n\nWhat does your creative process look like today? From start to finish.\n\nAnalog starts with illegible notes, chicken scratches, lists of lighting / material considerations. Then I move onto consolidating anything and everything that\u2019s either written or visual into a single space \u2014 Miro boards have been useful lately for collecting that. From there I organize the chaos a bit, write out a clear statement / composition and dive in digitally. Once a piece feels render-ready, I move onto post and generally enjoy adding in painted light, surreal finesses, etc. as the cherry on top. My favorite moment in the creative process is between finishing a piece and sharing it \u2014 it\u2019s an intimate self-fulfilling state.\n\nHow long does a piece usually take to create? Have you streamlined this process in anyway?\n\nIt varies! I used to be a speedy little demon, but my work was also a lot simpler \u2014 a single focal object and negative space. With enjoying a more complex approach to my work now, the time naturally has gone up. Sometimes an idea hits, I run with it, and in less than a day it\u2019s just right. Then there\u2019s other days, and more common as of late, where I\u2019ll have four-plus works in progress that I switch between over the course of weeks until one is right. If I had to give an estimated average of actively working on a personal piece, start to finish, most are done in eight to 14 hours.\n\nHow do you rest and recharge yourself when you\u2019re out of ideas?\n\nSpeaking my current language. I\u2019ve allowed client work to drain me more than is probably healthy this year, which leaves me quite dry for personal studies. It\u2019s honestly largely accepting this first, understanding you can\u2019t force something to spark if there\u2019s nothing there. Similar to my preferred inspiration-seeking routes, I find recharging most successful when unplugged. Allowing the mind to wander and feel free, in an almost meditative state, that really rejuvenates the concept muscles most effectively for me at this time.\n\nWhat software do you use to create your artwork?\n\nCinema 4D is my bread and butter. Supported by After Effects, Photoshop, Daz3d, Redshift, and very occasionally Zbrush and Substance Painter. There\u2019s so many applications out there it can feel like a complex dance navigating between them for some projects.\n\nWhat hardware do you use on a daily basis? What PC build are you running?\n\nIt\u2019s a beefy custom spaceship. I have a full-size case housing four 1080 TIs, an i7 processor, 128GB RAM, etc. I operate on Windows, being a PC, and I\u2019m not enough of a UI snob to bootcamp Apple. I\u2019ve been solely GPU rendering for a while, so it works out quite nicely for me, though I have to be cautious of temperatures during demanding projects. This summer has been a toasty one.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite creative tools and resources?\n\nOutside of my usuals I mentioned, I love Forester, it\u2019s amazing for working with foliage and developing a quick digital green thumb. I used to use Octane for texturing and rendering, and have largely moved onto Redshift now, which is also wonderful once you get the hang of it (not to mention stable). As for creative resources, I\u2019m really enjoying weekly to bi-weekly library trips to simply wander about and find something of substance to inspire my personal work.\n\nYour style is always so consistent between your personal and client work. How does your approach to client work differ from your personal?\n\nThat means a lot, thank you. Client work is usually on a faster track earlier in the process, the brief expedites figuring out the purpose, and from there it falls into line with my usual flow: writing out thoughts, sketches, and collecting assorted inspiration for how elements can work together. It\u2019s pretty analog all around until the first formal creative review, regardless of the project. With personal work, that is largely true as well: I\u2019ll bookmark pages, scratch out thoughts, and pull those physical and digital references into a consolidated space when I feel it\u2019s time to start making some magic happen.\n\nTell me more about H+ Creative. What\u2019s it like working with a creative agency and having representation?\n\nRepresentation is a very personal choice, but for me it has been such a relief and definitely secured some of my larger projects through the years. Not dealing with the logistics phase, having the majority of business side handled, and in general a person that mediates between myself and the client is *chef\u2019s kiss*. That being said, it\u2019s an intimate, professional relationship that naturally you want to last long term, so I waited until I found someone I truly related with for present and future goals before making the commitment.\n\nWhere do you envision yourself and your work evolving in the next few years?\n\nI consider myself a 3D designer, I want for that to evolve into an artist as I continue through this chapter of my work. By that, I mean being hired more purely for myself (not just skills), taking on projects that have a personal meaning, and also evolving outside of my current medium. When work simmers down I\u2019m looking forward to beginning to learn a game engine for starters. The future seems immersive and I\u2019d love to contribute to that vision.\n\nWhat\u2019s a dream project of yours?\n\nConcept art for a science fiction movie, preferably environmental or architectural, and getting my hands into more interactive work such as game concept art or actual design.\n\nWhat would you recommend for people who want to learn how to work in 3D, but don\u2019t know where to start?\n\nThe most important thing with going into a technical area of design or art is to first find your \u201cgeneralist\u201d program that works best for you. I recommend Cinema 4D, though I have a handful of colleagues who vouch for Blender, too. Once settled, spend the less-than-fun task of learning the interface and then it\u2019s time to get dirty with some polygons! Everything I\u2019ve learned has resulted from searching for educational resources online such as Greyscalegorilla, Eyedesyn, YouTube, and the forever faithful method of trial and error.", "description": "Artist Blake Kathryn\u2019s 3D dreamscapes have the power to transport viewers to another world.
