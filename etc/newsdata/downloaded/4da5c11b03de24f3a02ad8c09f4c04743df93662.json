I was speechless. I couldn't put it into words at the time, I was just appalled.\n\n'It's quite clear it's a funeral car. It's black and it says 'funeral service' in the window.\n\n'If the council don't overturn this ticket I'm going to leave a coffin at the council headquarters front doorstep. I'm just that disgusted.\n\nMr Elliott parked the black limousine (pictured) at The Ridings, behind Mark Elliot Funeral Services on St Giles' Street because it is the only road close and wide enough for the company's procession cars and hearses\n\nMr Elliott claims The Ridings behind his business is the only street close and wide enough for the company's procession cars and hearses.\n\nHe said it is not possible to park in St Giles Street, where the business has been for three years, as it would obstruct traffic\n\nHe added: 'I've been parking behind my business for three years when we're getting ready for a funeral and it's never been a problem.\n\nThe funeral director said that traffic wardens have always understood the parking issue because the business is a funeral service\n\n'Sometimes I have four limos and hearses here and it's not a problem.\n\n'Traffic wardens have always been okay with it because they see we are a funeral business.'\n\n'The car is left unattended for around five minutes.
