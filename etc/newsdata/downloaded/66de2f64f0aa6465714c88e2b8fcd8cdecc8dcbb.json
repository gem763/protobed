The study found the disease in nine out of 40 exposed animals\n\nTeen vaping has been deemed an 'epidemic' but US health officials, and we're only beginning to learn what immediate and long-term consequences the devices might have for the millions of young people using them.\n\nSome 80 percent of the Americans who have developed vaping-related lung injuries are under the age of 35, and 16 percent are teenagers 18 or under.\n\nDeaths have occurred in at least 16 states, with the latest confirmed in Connecticut.\n\nIt's clear the liquids heated by e-cigarettes are doing something potentially life-threatening to the lungs, but scientists have yet to work out exactly what.\n\nDr Moon-shong Tang at NYU has already begun looking at what might happen to them down the line.\n\nTheir previous work, published in 2018, had already demonstrated that e-cigarette vapor could trigger potentially carcinogenic DNA changes in petri dish samples of tissues.\n\nIn order to expand on those findings, they exposed 40 mice to high levels of e-cigarette 'smoke' for 54 weeks, or just over a year.\n\nThey chambers they used were a a bit like a pressure cooker test, in that the mice were surrounded by the vapor, so that their entire bodies might feel the effects.\n\nIndeed they did. nine of the 40 animals developed lung cancers.\n\nBut when they put 20 mice through the same paces using nicotine-free e-cig smoke, none of them developed cancer.\n\nMost warnings against smoking cigarettes have focused on the carcinogenic qualities of tobacco and the tiny particles inhaled when smoking a burning cigarette.\n\nThe role of nicotine in cancer has been more controversial.\n\nPrevious work has found that the processing done to tobacco in preparation to make cigarettes creates two carcinogenic compounds, NNN and NNK, nitrosamines that corrupt DNA and cause cancer.\n\nBut Dr Tang's previous work showed that e-cig smoke and nicotine itself could deposit the same problematic molecules as well as further encouraging DNA changes key to cancer development.\n\n'Our results support the argument that the nicotine-derived DNA adducts are likely the main causes for carcinogenesis in mice exposed to E-cig smoke,' said Dr Tang's co-author, Dr Herbert Lepor, a urologist at NYU.\n\nThat was further confirmed by the absence of lung cancers in the nice exposed to nicotine-free vapor.\n\n'Our next step in this line of work will be to expand the number of mice studied, to shorten and prolong E-cigarette exposure time, and to further investigate the genetic changes caused by E-cigarette smoke,' Dr Lepor added.", "description": "For a year, researchers at New York University exposed 40 mice to e-cigarette vapor.
