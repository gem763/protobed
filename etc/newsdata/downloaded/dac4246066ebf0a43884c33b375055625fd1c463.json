Ha Tae-keung, an opposition lawmaker of the Bareunmirae Party, asked Park his assessment of the likelihood of resumed nuclear testing by North Korea, referencing an ominous comment made by Kim Myong-gil, the regime\u2019s top nuclear negotiator, following the breakdown of discussions with the United States on Saturday. Kim told reporters in Sweden immediately after the talks that it was \u201centirely up to the United States\u201d whether North Korea would maintain its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.Park replied that based on the South Korean military\u2019s observations, Punggye-ri\u2019s tunnels No. 1 and 2 were demolished beyond recovery but that tunnels No. 3 and 4 could be \u201crepaired and used based on circumstances,\u201d implying that resuming nuclear weapons development wouldn\u2019t be difficult.Park was asked about press reports at the time of the Punggye-ri detonations alleging that only the entrances of the tunnels were destroyed. Outlets that were part of the press pool like CBS and CNN said that journalists only witnessed the gates to the tunnels being destroyed from a distance of approximately 500 meters (1,640 feet) and that they were not allowed to verify how extensive the demolitions had been.Tunnels No. 3 and 4 were widely seen as having been used for testing the regime\u2019s more modern nuclear weapons and were more important.The chairman of the JCS said if Pyongyang wanted to use the Punggye-ri facilities once again, it could after \u201ca few weeks to a few months\u201d of recovery efforts. Kim Young-hwan, chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under the Ministry of National Defense, also told lawmakers that it was possible for the North to restore Punggye-ri for regular use, even though there have been no signs of reconstruction efforts so far.In the 2019 report on \u201cAdherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments,\u201d the U.S. State Department assessed that the results of the detonations at Punggye-ri \u201care almost certainly reversible\u201d and that the regime could \u201cdevelop another nuclear test site, if it chose to do so.\u201dBY LEE CHUL-JAE, SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
