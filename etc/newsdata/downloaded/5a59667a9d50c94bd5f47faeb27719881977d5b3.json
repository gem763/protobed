You can also subscribe to our writing tips newsletter for even more tips.\n\nThis week's tip is from Igby Kin.\n\n\"Learn how to read your story out loud. Not only will you become a better editor, you'll also be prepared to read in front of an audience. Learn to read slowly and deliberately. Learn to enunciate. Learn to project. A great reading can make mediocre writing sound transcendent; a bad reading can make incredible writing sound awful.\"\n\nIgpy Kin is a writer, editor and rabblerouser.
