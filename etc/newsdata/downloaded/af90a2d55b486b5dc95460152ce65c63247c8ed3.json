Definitely the toughest I\u2019ve been involved with as a captain and as a player.\u201d\n\nHeather Knight is speaking at the end of a long and hard summer for the England Women\u2019s cricket team she has captained since 2016. She carries a relaxed air, sat in balmy September sunshine at the Kia Oval, but also a pensive one. Understandably so: she speaks not just at a time of great change for her side, but also ahead of major changes to the structure of English cricket, and particularly women\u2019s cricket, as a whole.\n\nEngland were thoroughly beaten by Australia by 12 points to four in the multi-format Ashes series this summer. It was a series of great disappointment after England had drawn the last series in Australia, and one that precipitated the departure of head coach Mark Robinson, who stepped down.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

They got on a bit of a winning streak and are obviously a very good team,\u201d Knight reflects on a summer that saw her team promise much and deliver little.\n\n\u201cI guess the frustration is there were moments in those first few games where we could have won but just didn\u2019t necessarily capitalise.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was a fine cricketing summer, one of the men\u2019s first World Cup win, an enthralling men\u2019s Ashes, and two brilliant and dramatic finals days.\n\nThe manner of the Australia win meant that Knight\u2019s side largely missed out. In a summer where cricket filled pages front and back, the Women\u2019s Ashes became an uncomfortably one-sided footnote, rather than the headline news it might have been.\n\nThe defeat also came just before domestic women\u2019s cricket in England undergoes sweeping structural change. Three new competitions and an investment injection of potentially \u00a320million arrive next year, with, pleasingly, many more female players to be paid.\n\nThe Hundred, the great spectre that looms over English cricket, is vitally important to the women\u2019s game, more so than to the men\u2019s. Whereas it exists as an additional fourth competition to a men\u2019s schedule of familiarity and tradition, the women\u2019s Hundred is directly replacing the Kia Super League, a flagship competition that has been vital to taking women\u2019s cricket forward.\n\nKnight is sad to see the KSL go. Her Western Storm reached finals day in all four seasons, winning the competition twice, including this summer. It is not often as a professional athlete you get the opportunity to help a team be built from the ground up, but Knight has enjoyed that privilege.\n\nWhile excited about the Hundred, she admits that she will miss the Storm particularly. It is, in her own words, \u201cbittersweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was the final that the competition deserved,\u201d Knight says of the 2019 final, in which she starred with a match-winning unbeaten 78. \u201cThe four years have been brilliant. It was great to end it with a brilliant close game down at Hove.\n\n\u201cI say bittersweet because I\u2019m excited for the future but also disappointed that the Western Storm, the thing we\u2019ve created over four years, will be no more. I am very excited for The Hundred, the opportunity it gives the women\u2019s game to be alongside the men\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think it is really important that the women\u2019s competition doesn\u2019t get lost, which occasionally can happen when the women\u2019s game is put alongside the men\u2019s. I think it is important that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that journalists following it and the players make sure that the women\u2019s Hundred is up there with the men\u2019s. It is going to be a brilliant competition for young girls to see men\u2019s and women\u2019s cricket alongside each other.\u201d\n\nConcerns over the women\u2019s tournament being overshadowed are increasing. ESPN Cricinfo report each men\u2019s side will pay two players \u00a3125,000 each. The total budget for the 15-player women\u2019s teams will be \u00a3120,000.\n\nFurther, while the men\u2019s team to be based at Manchester will play their home games at Old Trafford, the women are likely to play at Sedbergh in Cumbria \u2013 80 miles from their supposed home. The Cardiff-based side may be called the Welsh Fire; the women\u2019s team are expected to play three of their four home games in England.\n\nThe Hundred will have to carry forward the progress the KSL made, but beyond there are wider improvements needed as English cricket looks to narrow the gap to the all-conquering Australia side.\n\nThere are hopes that the restructuring will lessen the player base disparity \u2013 Australia has five times as many professional female cricketers.\n\nAnd while the KSL did plenty of good for the visibility of the game, the competition was largely dominated by overseas stars and entrenched England names.\n\nRobinson has been criticised for his failure to bring talent up into the England side. Though he improved those within the set-up considerably \u2013 Knight points to Danni Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont particularly \u2013 the gap between the 20-or-so centrally contracted players and the rest has only widened.\n\nKnight believes the restructure should help.\n\n\u201cI think it is going to be a real gamechanger.\n\n\u201cIt will take a few years to bed in, but hopefully it will give us a bigger pool of players to pick from, and give players who maybe lose their contracts something to go into below and try and fight their way back.\n\n\u201cTo have a structure in the long-term is going to be great and it\u2019s going to provide England girls more games, more pressure environments and that\u2019s how you learn as players \u2013 the more you are tested against tough opposition.\u201d\n\nIt is important that women\u2019s cricket continues to grow, particularly with such strides being made across women\u2019s sport on a macro level. This summer alone has seen a record-breaking FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, a superb Netball World Cup and the innovative Women\u2019s Rugby Super Series, to name but three events to have caught the eye.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a sort of community of women\u2019s sport,\u201d Knight says of cross-sport kinship. \u201cWe often talk to women\u2019s footballers, rugby players, and it\u2019s great to follow what they are doing and talk about our experiences.\n\n\u201cDo we have a duty [to take women\u2019s sport forward]? I think yes, but it doesn\u2019t feel like a duty, it feels like the right thing and something we are desperate to do. As players it is our job to keep driving things forward and play exciting cricket that people want to come and watch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how much things have changed in the past few years and I know players around the world just want to keep raising the bar.\u201d\n\nGirls\u2019 cricket continues to grow. Some clubs now have more female youth players than male, and twice as many girls took part in the ECB\u2019s All Stars scheme in 2018 as compared to 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see. For any young eight-year-old girl to see the same path as an eight-year-old boy is important, to see it as a game for girls as much as it is for boys,\u201d Knight concludes. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it? We want to see as many people as possible, boys and girls, enjoying the game and seeing the game thrive.\u201d\n\nHeather Knight was speaking at Finals Day of the Kia Summer Smash.
