Time\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner, or winners, of this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize Friday in Oslo, Norway.\n\nThe prize is awarded annually to the person or organization that has \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"\n\nLast year, the five-person Norwegian committee awarded the coveted prize to Denis Mukwege from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nadia Murad from Iraq for their work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.\n\nThe announcement of the prize\u2019s winner follows Thursday\u2019s 2018 and 2019 literature prize, which was suspended last year after sex abuse allegations.\n\nAccording to the Nobel Institute, there are 301 candidates for this year\u2019s prize, out of which 223 are individuals and 78 are organizations.\n\nThe names of Nobel Peace Prize nominees aren't revealed until 50 years after the prize is awarded, however, these are a few predicted frontrunners:\n\nGreta Thunberg\n\nGreta Thunberg speaks at a rally on Friday Sept. 20, 2019 in New York.

An estimated total of 4 to 7.6 million people participated in September's Global Climate Strike, which took place before the 2019 UN Summit. At the congregation, the 16-year-old Swede berated world leaders for not doing enough to stop climate change.\n\n\"We are in the beginning of mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?\u201d she said.\n\nHer first address to the UN took place in Poland at the United Nations COP24 Climate Summit last year, where talks culminated to nearly 200 nations agreeing to rules that will govern the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nLast month, Thunberg won the Right Livelihood award, often referred to as the \"Alternative Nobel,\" for \"inspiring and amplifying political demands for urgent climate action reflecting scientific facts.\"\n\nJacinda Ardern\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern speaks during The Power Of Inclusion Summit 2019 at Aotea Centre on October 03, 2019 in Auckland, New Zealand.

She simultaneously promised her nation's parliament that she wouldn't promote the shooter's notoriety and refused to repeat his name.\n\nArdern is New Zealand's youngest leader in decades and was the second elected leader to give birth while still in office.\n\nAbiy Ahmed\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, wearing a white coat bearing the traditional Kafficho colours of red, green and blue, address the crowd in Bonga, the main town in Kaffa province, some 449km south west of the capital Addis Ababa, on September 15, 2019.

According to TIME, at least 70,000 people were killed since the border disputes began in 1998, five years after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia.\n\nAlthough thousands of political prisoners have been freed since Ahmed took office in April 2018, Ethiopia's internal issues still divide the country.\n\nReporters without Borders\n\nPeople protest and commemorate the first anniversary of the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in an event organized by Reporters Without Borders outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy on October 01, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

They were at the forefront of voices who spoke out against Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year.\n\nRSF has organized a petition that calls on the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to release the 28 journalists and bloggers that are currently detained. According to their website, the number of imprisoned journalists has doubled in Saudi Arabia since the crown prince was appointed in 2017.\n\nRaoni Metuktire\n\nIn this file photo taken on September 06, 2019 Brazil's indigenous chief Raoni Metuktire of the Kayapo people looks on during a press conference in Bordeaux ahead of the Climax environment festival.

The Brazilian chief met twice with French president Emmanuel Macron, Reuters reported, who stemmed the international campaign to bring awareness to the burning rainforest.\n\nAlexis Tsipras and Zoran Zaev\n\nFormer Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras speaks to the media as he arrives to attend the 45th edition of the annual \"The European House Ambrosetti\" forum on economy on September 7, 2019 at Villa D'Este in Cernobbio, near Como, northern Italy.

The two prime ministers put 30 years of acrimony between their neighboring countries behind them when they agreed that the former Yugoslav republic should officially be renamed from Macedonia to North Macedonia and Greece should drop its objections to its neighbor joining NATO.\n\nContributing: Associated Press.
