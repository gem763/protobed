(Orlean Parish District Attorney's Office)\n\nShe didn\u2019t notice the man following her as she walked to her French Quarter home in New Orleans on a March evening in 1987. When the 29-year-old opened her front door, Alfred Berry shoved her inside at gunpoint, bound and raped her. He took a diamond ring, cash and other jewelry before leaving the house.\n\nPolice later found the diamond ring at a pawnshop connected to Berry, prosecutors said. Officers lifted Berry\u2019s fingerprint from the jewelry box. Three other women also identified Berry as the man who had raped them between July and November 1986.\n\nYet, Berry avoided a rape conviction for three decades after juries repeatedly let him off and prosecutors declined to pursue further charges \u2014 until this month, when the 52-year-old was convicted after DNA evidence conclusively tied him to six cold cases and a seventh rape in which a jury previously found him not guilty.\n\nOn Friday, Berry was sentenced to 35 years in prison without parole, during a hearing in which several of his victims voiced their frustration and relief that he had finally been convicted of the brutal attacks.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fool science, thank God,\u201d one of the women said in court last week, NOLA.com reported.\n\nFor decades, police had suspected Berry was a serial rapist. An 18-year-old woman pinned down in her bedroom in the Treme neighborhood in July 1986 picked Berry out of a police photo lineup. A 16-year-old kidnapped at a Bywater bus stop and raped behind a backyard shed a day later told officers Berry had attacked her. A 21-year-old who was attacked that November walking home from an Uptown bus stop also recognized Berry as her attacker.\n\nThen-district attorney Harry Connick never indicted Berry in any of those cases because his office could not track down the victims to testify at trial, the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office later said.\n\nAt least two more women also reported being attacked in a similar manner in 1986 and 1987, but prosecutors did not tie those cases to Berry until the DNA evidence was tested.\n\nBerry stood trial in 1988 on charges of raping three other women but was not convicted, including in the case of the 29-year-old who had been raped at gunpoint in her home in the French Quarter. That woman testified in court, repeatedly recounting the brutal attack.\n\nAlthough a jury convicted Berry of robbing her, it deadlocked on the rape charge and a mistrial was declared. A second hung jury led the prosecutor to drop the rape charge to secure the robbery conviction.\n\nBerry\u2019s defense attorney and a single witness questioned whether police had correctly identified Berry, pointing out distinctive tattoos on his arm, face and hand that the victim didn\u2019t conclusively identify.\n\n\u201cThe acquittal was very much of a shock to everyone involved,\u201d Kevin Boshea, a former sex crimes prosecutor who now works as a defense attorney, told NOLA.com.\n\nThe French Quarter woman \u201cwas forever changed by her rape,\u201d a family member later told prosecutors. After the second jury failed to convict Berry for raping her, she killed herself.\n\nBerry was hit with a 99-year sentence for the armed robbery in 1988. The judge issued the harshest possible sentence, calling the previous acquittals and the mistrials on the rape charge \u201cthe gravest miscarriage of justice imaginable.\u201d\n\nIn the past two years, though, District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro\u2019s office and the New Orleans police began testing shelved rape kits after receiving grants to try to solve cold cases. The effort has identified at least eight rapists and solved 17 cold cases, NOLA.com reported last year.\n\nAnd in March 2018, Berry was finally charged with 12 charges of aggravated rape and kidnapping. DNA linked Berry to the rapes of the 29-year-old woman in the French Quarter; the 16-year-old girl in Bywater; two 18-year-old women in Treme; a 21-year-old woman in Uptown; and a 51-year-old woman, also at her French Quarter home. Genetic testing also linked Berry to one of the two 1988 cases, in which a jury found him not guilty, but prosecutors said they cannot charge him again in that crime.\n\nOn Sept. 6, Berry pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree rape and kidnapping, according to court records.\n\nOn Friday, three of Berry\u2019s victims faced him in court and described the lasting pain of his attacks. Two more asked prosecutors to read their written statements, NOLA.com reported.\n\nDressed in black, the woman who had been 16 when Berry grabbed her at a Bywater bus stop addressed her attacker directly.\n\n\u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember me, but I remember you,\u201d she said, NOLA.com reported.\n\nShe described years of nightmares and depression she suffered after the attack. She also talked about her family and husband, who came to court with her Friday.\n\n\u201cThey have helped me to never give up,\u201d she said, \u201cand helped me know that I can survive, and I will survive.\u201d\n\nWhile Berry would have been eligible to seek parole in 2037 under his original robbery conviction, the district attorney\u2019s office said, the new 35-year sentence doled out Friday will keep him in prison at least until 2053, when he will be 86.\n\nIn court, the woman who said Berry raped her but saw a jury let him walk in 1988 said she finally felt vindicated by the justice system. DNA evidence in her case tied Berry to her attack, although prosecutors could not charge him again.\n\n\u201cThirty-three years ago, judge, I was held at gunpoint by this man,\u201d she said, NOLA.com reported. \u201cI was tied up, and I was raped. I\u2019ve always known that he did it, and I strongly feel that he needs to remain exactly where he is.\u201d", "description": "Several women identified Alfred Berry as the man who raped them between 1986 and 1987, but prosecutors did not convict him for the serial rapes until Friday.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Katie Shepherd Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
