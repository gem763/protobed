The LSU product was also limited in 2017, his last college season, by a nagging knee injury, but did not undergo surgery.\n\nGuice, who suffered the injury in Sunday\u2019s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, met with Andrews and decided surgery was the best option.\n\nThe Redskins are still deciding whether to place the 22-year-old on injured reserve, coach Jay Gruden said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a concern with him getting back to full strength,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe came back extremely strong with a much more damaged knee last time.\n\nThis is more of a minor procedure from what I\u2019ve been told. He will be back. \u2026 Eventually, he\u2019s going to show Redskins Nation what he\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad for me!!\u201d Guice tweeted. \u201cThis is what I signed up (for)! It wear and tears on your body over time! I\u2019ve been doing this 15 years!! Trust the process. \u2026 Head up chin up and grind.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins will now turn to the veteran Adrian Peterson \u2014 a week after the 35-year-old was a healthy scratch against the Philadelphia Eagles. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Gruden said he was confident in Peterson\u2019s ability to produce.\n\nGruden said he addressed the team before leaving Peterson off the game-day roster, but doesn\u2019t see it as an issue moving forward.\n\nPeterson doesn\u2019t either, calling it \u201cwater under the bridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like a rollercoaster,\u201d Peterson said of the saga. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time high leading up and then you\u2019re at an all-time low. \u2026 But I\u2019m a professional. I\u2019ve been through way worse than not being active for Week 1.\u201d\n\nGuice had just 18 yards on 10 carries in Philadelphia.\n\nHe told reporters after the game he felt healthy. Guice, though, went into the team\u2019s medical tent during the first half to get evaluated. Riding the bus after the game, Guice felt soreness in his knee, Gruden said Monday.\n\nGuice was expected to be the offense\u2019s workhorse, part of the reason Peterson was inactive Sunday \u2014 the Redskins needed the spot for a player who could play on special teams.\n\nGruden\u2019s handling of Peterson unsettled some veterans inside the locker room. Right tackle Morgan Moses called the move a \u201cslap in the face\u201d during a radio appearance, while running back Chris Thompson acknowledged it \u201cchanged everything for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIn his post-game press conference, Gruden quipped the Redskins would use Peterson in the future \u201cif we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in the I formation.\u201d NFL teams, of course, rarely run the ball that often.\n\nBut with Guice out, Peterson will get his chance. The former league MVP ran for 1,042 yards and seven touchdowns for Washington last season \u2014 joining the Redskins in August after Guice\u2019s torn ACL.\n\nPeterson said he sent Guice a long text message, encouraging him to stay positive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to wrap your mind around it and accept it for what it is,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cJust grinding and working to get back stronger.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
