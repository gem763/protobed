While Guice\u2019s injury isn\u2019t season-ending, this is the latest setback for Guice, who hurt his knee after just one game to start 2019.\n\nGuice met with Andrews earlier in the day, according to multiple reports, and decided surgery was the best option. The 22-year-old had his meniscus trimmed instead of fully removed, ESPN reported.\n\nThe Redskins will now turn to Adrian Peterson in Guice\u2019s absence \u2014 a week after the 35-year-old was a healthy scratch against the Philadelphia Eagles. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, coach Jay Gruden said he was confident in Peterson\u2019s ability to produce.\n\nGruden said he addressed the team before benching for Peterson, but doesn\u2019t see it as an issue moving forward.\n\n\u201cThe line loves blocking for Adrian Peterson,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. The line likes to block for Derrius Guice, but we only have one ball. That\u2019s in the past.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
