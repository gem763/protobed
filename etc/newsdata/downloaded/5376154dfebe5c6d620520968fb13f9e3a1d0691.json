Former NSC staffer Fiona Hill spoke for ten hours yesterday with members of three house committees digging into Ukraine-Gate in closed session. Her testimony, according to the Washington Post\u2019s sources, focused mainly on Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, which suggests that Hill might not have any direct testimony to give about Donald Trump in the impeachment case House Democrats want to build:\n\nIn a closed-door session that lasted roughly 10 hours, Hill told lawmakers that she confronted Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, about Giuliani\u2019s activities which, she testified, were not coordinated with the officials responsible for carrying out U.S. foreign policy, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose details of her deposition. Sondland played a leading role in the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations of the president\u2019s political rivals, text messages obtained and later released by House Democrats show. Three congressional committees are now probing how Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, as well as a debunked theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election in an attempt to damage Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nThe text messages from Sondland don\u2019t exactly make a prima facie case for that allegation; it\u2019s the return messages from the US charges d\u2019affaires Bill Taylor that raises those suspicions. Sondland\u2019s text messages declare that Trump didn\u2019t want a quid pro quo but was instead focused on dealing with corruption in general. Hill apparently has her suspicions based on the way in which Sondland and Giuliani conducted diplomacy in Ukraine.\n\nFor his part, Giuliani insists that he has no idea what Hill is talking about. More importantly, Giuliani also alleges that Hill has no idea what she\u2019s talking about:\n\nGiuliani on Monday night said: \u201cI don\u2019t know Fiona and can\u2019t figure out what she is talking about,\u201d adding that his contact with Ukrainian officials was set up with the State Department. \u201cI reported everything back to them,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing shadowy about it.\u201d Giuliani also said he believed Hill was out of the loop compared to Sondland and others involved with Ukraine. \u201cShe just didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. He added he\u2019d never talked to her about Ukraine policy.\n\nAgain, there is at least some question as to how much Hill would have been read into diplomatic affairs. While the NSC participates significantly in foreign relations, diplomacy is the purview of the State Department and the president. Sondland reports to Mike Pompeo, not staffers at the NSC, except to the extent that Pompeo might direct Sondland to coordinate with them. Pompeo has a seat at the NSC, which Hill does not, and so would be the person who chooses what from State\u2019s efforts to share and what to keep closer to the vest. If Giuliani was coordinating his efforts with State, that would be sufficient \u2014 although it might end up putting Pompeo and Sondland on the hot seat.\n\nHowever, Hill also worked for someone else who would have been read into situations like Ukraine \u2014 and who might connect more dots. Hill testified that John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national-security adviser, was angry over Giuliani\u2019s actions in Ukraine and referred to them as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d at one point. Bolton told Hill to alert the NSC\u2019s legal team about potential wrongdoing involving Sondland, Giuliani, and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney:\n\nThe aide, Fiona Hill, testified that Mr. Bolton told her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about a rogue effort by Mr. Sondland, Mr. Giuliani and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, according to the people familiar with the testimony. \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Mr. Bolton, a Yale-trained lawyer, told Ms. Hill to tell White House lawyers, according to two people at the deposition. (Another person in the room initially said Mr. Bolton referred to Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mulvaney, but two others said he cited Mr. Sondland.) It was not the first time Mr. Bolton expressed grave concerns to Ms. Hill about the campaign being run by Mr. Giuliani. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d Ms. Hill quoted Mr. Bolton as saying during an earlier conversation.\n\nAnd that has everyone wondering whether the next invitation will go to the \u2018Stache:\n\nAnd in a sign the impeachment inquiry is widening, investigators were discussing whether to question John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, according to people familiar with the matter. Bolton was Hill\u2019s direct superior at the NSC.\n\nHoo boy. Hill may or may not have been too low a level for these conversations, but Bolton would have had a front-row seat to all of them. Bolton just left the administration on bad terms, and if the description of Hill\u2019s testimony by the NYT and Post are accurate, the unhappiness was definitely mutual. Bolton is not known for holding back when wronged, but then again, Bolton also has plenty of reasons to distrust Democrats on Capitol Hill, too.\n\nCould Bolton\u2019s testimony sink Trump? Looping Mulvaney into the equation is new, if in fact that\u2019s what Hill actually said. That would put whatever Giuliani and Sondland were doing just outside the Oval Office, making it look less like Giuliani was just going cowboy. Impeachment is already pretty much a fait accompli anyway, but an explosive connection of dots by Bolton might make it tougher for Senate Republicans to just dismiss this as a political vendetta over the 2016 election.\n\nOf course, Bolton might just say that this was between Sondland and Giuliani. So far, no other witness has tied any of this to Trump himself. By the way, the NYT report confirms that House Democrats came up empty on the quid pro quo issue again:\n\nHer testimony did not establish a quid pro quo between the suspended aid and Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure for investigations, according to the person. But she confirmed that the administration leveraged a coveted White House invitation for Mr. Zelensky to a commitment to investigate corruption, which was seen as code for investigating Democrats.\n\nOr it could just be that Trump wanted a better effort from Ukraine on corruption, like the rest of the West has been demanding. Wasn\u2019t that what Joe Biden claimed?", "description": "\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Trump-Bolton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
