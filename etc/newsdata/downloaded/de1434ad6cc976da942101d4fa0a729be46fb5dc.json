But this lot can play and when the heat came on the Scots were not to up.\n\nThe tragic events of Saturday Typhoon Hagibis did its worst and claimed the lives of more than 15 people in the Tokyo area Japan were in need of a lift.\n\nThe nightmare scenario for the Brave Blossoms was the possibility that they would lose here and face elimination despite winning three of their pool matches.\n\nThat is what happened four years ago in England when, under the coaching of Eddie Jones, they were stymied by a defeat by Scotland at Kingsholm following a short turnaround after the miracle defeat of South Africa in Brighton.\n\nThe fans here were going bananas before the start of the game and by half-time with Japan leading 21-7 the noise was off the scale. After the saga of whether the game would played or not, as a result of the disruptive weather, it was good to see the Japanese get on the park.\n\nThey are light years ahead of the side that beat the Springboks in 2015 as head coach Jamie Joseph has made them tactically smart.\n\nThat win over South Africa was all about hanging in and being brave in the last few minutes, it might never happen again.\n\nThis and their win over Ireland were never in doubt. They were the better side on both occasions and might give the Boks a rattle in the quarter-finals.\n\nJapan should certainly not be scared of going up against them. Here they were superb in denying Scotland the ball and had scored three tries by half-time.\n\nAfter Finn Russell had scored for the Scots, to quieten the crowd slightly, Japan surged back into the match.\n\nWing Matsushima, who has a touch of Hollywood about him, made the most of a brilliant offload from Fukuoka to get over in the corner. Talk about a crowd pleaser.\n\nNext up on 26 minutes it was the turn of prop Keita Inagaki to score a try that he will be boring the Front Row Union about for years to come.\n\nIn truth he did not have much work to do but he was in support of hooker Shota Horie and flanker Pieter Labuschagne before flopping over the line.\n\nThe Scots were bang up against it now and Japan did not relent. Just before the break Fukuoka made mincemeat of the Scottish defence and he was at it again just after the interval to secure his legendary status in these parts and get Japan the bonus point.\n\nThen came the Scotland comeback. Prop WP Nel went over Jonny Gray's line break and Greg Laidlaw's snipe and on 55 minutes replacement front rower Zander Fagerson bulldozed over.\n\nThat was 28-21 and an invitation for Japan to show us what they have got. And they have got plenty even with the Scots fighting for their World Cup lives.", "description": "Japan\u00a0lifted the roof off their own World Cup\u00a0as they made it four wins out of four to top Pool A and sent\u00a0Scotland\u00a0home before the knockout stages.
