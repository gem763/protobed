Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, a separate office, has declined to comment on whether it has opened an inquiry into the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has broken decades of precedent by refusing to reveal his tax returns. He has given a variety of explanations as to why he won\u2019t make them public, saying that they are under audit or that they are too complicated for people to understand.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have filed suit against the Treasury Department, alleging Trump\u2019s tax returns must be turned over under federal law.\n\nLast month, the Justice Department urged a federal judge to throw out the suit, saying the federal court lacked jurisdiction under the Constitution to hear the case.\n\n\u201cFor nearly two hundred years, the Legislative Branch never invoked the power of the Judiciary to decide which side should win in a political battle with the Executive,\u201d Justice Department lawyers argued in the filing.\n\nNeal had previously argued in a court filing that the Treasury Department, in refusing to turn over the tax returns, had \u201cmounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation\u2019s voluntary tax system.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The inspector general confirmed the investigation in a brief interview.", "authors": ["Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "Tom Hamburger", "Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money", "Politics In Washington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/G9ZU5TqFM3_1ZQlxnglfLub322k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E6SVZTXGFQI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
