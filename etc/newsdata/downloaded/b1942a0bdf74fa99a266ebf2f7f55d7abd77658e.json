The most prominent Trumpian figures haven\u2019t risen because they are thought leaders, policy entrepreneurs, or public-sector administrators. Rather they\u2019ve gained celebrity primarily through their reflexive, vociferous defense of the president\u2019s behavior du jour, whether his tax cuts and tariffs or Twitter antics and international intrigues. Loyal lieutenants they have been; independent-minded, budding successors of a movement, not so much.\n\nGiven its dearth of both governing principles and deputies prepared to govern, Trumpism\u2019s continuation would depend on future leaders\u2019 constantly seeking Trump\u2019s counsel. But that\u2019s not how politics works. Parties are fiercely loyal to their presidents while they are in office but then they quickly move on. There is little sentimentality in politics. Democrats left LBJ behind in 1969 and immediately moved past Carter in 1981. Republicans did the same to Nixon-Ford in 1977 and George H.W. Bush in 1993. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all won two terms, but not long after they walked out of the Oval Office, their parties had them in their rearview mirrors. The only president of the last half century with a sustained influence on his party\u2019s politics and philosophy was Reagan; and\u2014heavens\u2014Trump is no Reagan.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know which individuals will emerge as the GOP\u2019s leaders post-Trump, but we should appreciate how little fidelity they will have to the ex-president. Trump treats others as dispensable. When he no longer possesses power, many Republicans\u2014especially those who\u2019ve been insulted by him\u2014will surely be glad to reciprocate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andy Smarick", "Thebulwark.Com The-Post-Trump-Gop"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
