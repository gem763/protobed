The court ruled against Facebook, dealing a heavy hit on tech companies as lawmakers and platforms continue to discuss how to regulate online speech.\n\n\u201cEU law does not preclude a host provider like Facebook from being ordered to remove identical and, in certain circumstances, equivalent comments previously declared to be illegal,\u201d the court said in a statement. \u201cIn addition, EU law does not preclude such an injunction from producing effects worldwide, within the framework of the relevant international law.\u201d\n\nIn its ruling, the European Court of Justice affirms that companies like Facebook and Twitter are not liable for the content posted on their platforms, but that exemption does not prohibit the courts from ordering the companies to take down illegal content. Late last month, this same court ruled that Google doesn\u2019t need to remove links taken down from \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests worldwide. But illegal content can be limited internationally, according to Thursday\u2019s Facebook ruling.\n\nFacebook opposed the ruling. \u201cThis judgment raises critical questions around freedom of expression and the role that internet companies should play in monitoring, interpreting and removing speech that might be illegal in any particular country,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt undermines the longstanding principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country. It also opens the door to obligations being imposed on internet companies to proactively monitor content and then interpret if it is \u2018equivalent\u2019 to content that has been found to be illegal.\u201d", "description": "The European Court of Justice came to its decision after an Austrian politician, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, requested an order that would force Facebook to remove comments that were \"harmful to her reputation.\" Glawischnig-Piesczek argued that Facebook should remove the comments and limit access to them worldwide.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kYtO9IbsqxwxDSrBBapgNVeuPeA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10626563/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
