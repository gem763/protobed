We will still have to get through Fiji and Uruguay, and Fiji did well against Australia in their first game.\n\n\"Looking at it, you could argue it (Australia) is the crunch game, but we have to dust ourselves off first of all.\n\n\"We are pretty disappointed we conceded those two tries (against Georgia), to be honest with you.\n\n\"I think we were looking to keep them scoreless, but Australia is something to look forward to. It's a six-day turnaround, and we will manage the week well and look forward to getting out there on Sunday. \"", "description": "Who is in Wales' World Cup squad?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Mick Cleary", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan", "Paul Hayward", "Richard Bath"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/01/08/TELEMMGLPICT000179808090-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
