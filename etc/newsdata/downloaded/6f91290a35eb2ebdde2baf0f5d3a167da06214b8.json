Organic revenue \u2014 a key performance measure for the company \u2014 rose 4.3%, topping analyst forecasts for 3.4% growth. Core earnings \u2014 another closely watched measure on PepsiCo \u2014came in at $1.56 a share versus estimates for $1.50 a share.\n\nPerformance for PepsiCo\u2019s two key segments \u2014 North American Beverages and Quaker Foods North America \u2014 continued to deliver mixed results. Volume at Quaker Foods North America fell 1% and by 1.5% for PepsiCo North America Beverages. Core operating profits dropped 11% and 5%, respectively, for the segments.\n\nBut it was PepsiCo\u2019s overseas businesses and the powerhouse that is Frito Lay North America that essentially made the quarter. Core operating profits rose 7% at Frito Lay, 12% in Latin America and 14% in Europe \u2014 likely reflecting the company\u2019s efforts under new CEO Ramon Laguarta to more closely manage costs.\n\nThe company\u2019s guidance was on the favorable side, too. It expects to meet or exceed its organic sales growth of 4% this year. Full-year core earnings are still seen dropping 3% to $5.50 a share.\n\nThe earnings beat and generally solid operating profit showings in key businesses should feed the bull case on PepsiCo that more recently, has come into question, according to those on Wall Street following the stock\u2019s strong 22% year-to-date gain.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that the market underestimates the mix shift occurring at Pepsi, with the beleaguered PepsiCo Bottling North America segment accounting for just 19% of profit in FY19, down from 26% in FY16, while the high-growth and accelerating US snacks and international segments are now three-quarters of profit,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian. \u201cWe also believe PepsiCo valuation remains compelling, with PepsiCo trading at a -5%/-15% CY20 P/E and EV/EBITDA discount to mega-cap peers (KO/CL/PG) despite superior fundamentals.\u201d\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
