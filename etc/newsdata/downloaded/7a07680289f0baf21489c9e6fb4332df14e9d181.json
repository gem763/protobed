Baby lavender, comes with certificate, clothes and a bracelet, hardly been touched.\"\n\nThe hairdresser shared Rose's comments on Facebook in a post that has since gone viral with more than 8,000 likes and comments.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nMs Cowley, from Port Talbot, South Wales, said: \"She thought I was selling my actual child on Facebook.\n\n\"I was surprised. Come on, I know they're very life-like and the description wasn't the best, but who would sell a baby on Facebook Marketplace?\n\n\"My boyfriend James [Lupton] was on the phone to me at the time and when I told him he was laughing and was then speechless.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"People said they could never look at a Jaffa Cake the same again after the comment that Rose used.\n\n\"I can't wait to tell my daughter when she's older about the day someone thought I was trying to sell her on Facebook.\"\n\nMs Cowley posted an advert for the hand-made doll on Monday after buying it for Freya last Christmas.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nThe youngster had barely touched the vinyl baby, so her mum decided to list it online for \u00a3220 in a bid to boost funds ahead of Christmas shopping this year.\n\nAs the mum scrolled through her phone during a lunch break on Tuesday, she spotted a message asking about her listing, before Rose launched into a scathing rant.\n\nThe message read: \"Is this still available?\n\n'You want to be utterly fing ashamed of yourself, wanting to sell this gorgeous baby girl.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"If you didn't want her then you should have kept your f***ing legs shut.\n\n\"People like you should have their jaffas sewn up so you can't have no more.\n\n\"You're [a] disgusting piece of trash.\"\n\nIn response to the rude message, Ms Cowley wrote: \"It's a doll [laughing face emoji].\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"So yes Rose, take your stinking attitude elsewhere and read the description before you go bumping your gums.\"\n\nMs Cowley posted in a \"reborn\" dolls group asking for advice on how much to charge for baby Lavender - which has the same size and weight as a newborn - before listing it on Facebook's Marketplace.\n\nShe said: \"I bought the reborn doll last Christmas for my daughter.\n\n\"With it only being 10 months old and hardly touched or played with, I decided to sell it so I could put it towards new gifts for Christmas.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I wasn't sure how much I would get for her as she wasn't old and in very good condition.\n\n\"I reached out on Facebook to see if some professionals could give me a rough idea how much I would I would get for her.\n\n\"I had people message me and help me out with the pricing.\n\n\"My initial advert didn't state it was a reborn doll, hence why she didn't know, but no normal person would sell a child.\n\n\"I changed the advert after all the comments and message from Rose and I added the price she was worth.\"\n\nMs Cowley has yet to find a new home for the doll, which experts have estimated is worth between \u00a3180 and \u00a3250.\n\nShe added: \"Some people must think she's a doll from a shop and not worth much, but there are collectors out there who know their value.\"", "description": "A Facebook user ranted \"you should have kept your f***ing legs shut\" and your \"jaffa should be sewn up\" as Jade Cowley, 24, tried to sell the realistic-looking \"reborn\" doll for \u00a3220", "authors": ["Sophie Norris", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20648403.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
