In the end, everyone cowers \u2014 including a series of American corporations that have made the Chinese Communist Party unhappy with increasingly vague interpretations of challenges to its sovereignty. Mercedes-Benz, for one, was reprimanded for quoting the Dalai Lama in an ad. Every capitulation allows China\u2019s government to flex even harder in its next battle, like a snowball collecting speed and mass as it rolls downhill.\n\n\u201cThe NBA should not cave in so easily to China,\u201d said Dr. Josephine Chiu-Duke, an associate professor of Chinese intellectual history at the University of British Columbia. \u201cThis kind of a reaction from Chinese fans and their government should not be encouraged by people in our society. Otherwise, they will indirectly play a role in fostering this \u2014 in my view \u2014 extreme form of nationalism, and that\u2019s no help to any member in the international community and is no help to enhance the relationship between China and the West.\u201d All the while, Morey\u2019s job, billions of dollars in revenue, and the NBA\u2019s future in the world\u2019s most populous country hang in the balance.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nIt started with a drove of companies based in China, where the Rockets \u2014 thanks to Yao Ming\u2019s nine seasons in Houston \u2014 are the NBA\u2019s most popular team, dropping their sponsorships. Maybe some were nudged. Likely, they didn\u2019t have to be. \u201cEvery entity in China, including now, even foreign entities but particularly Chinese companies, all have Communist Party committees,\u201d explained Dr. Stanley Rosen, a political science professor specializing in Chinese politics and society at the University of Southern California and the author of the upcoming book, \u201cSoft Power with Chinese Characteristics: China's Campaign for Hearts and Minds.\u201d\n\nTencent Holdings, despite paying the NBA $1.5 billion for the rights to stream live games, which 490 million viewers tuned into last year, announced it would not broadcast Rockets games. Chiu-Duke spies an opportunity here. \u201cIf China discontinued every business deal with the NBA, their fans would do something eventually to maybe pressure their government not to do these kinds of things.\u201d\n\nAnd Tencent presumably has to make its $1.5 billion back. The problem is, they are Tencent\u2019s purse strings, not the government\u2019s. As unlikely as it may be for a company as successful as Tencent, the threat of extinction, as it does for any company in China that refuses to do the government\u2019s bidding, always hovers over them. \u201cThey have to go along no matter how much money they might lose,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cThe NBA is very popular in China, so the fans are going to suffer, but there\u2019s nothing they can do about it. For Tencent, being aligned with the government position with the Chinese Communist Party position is an existential question: without that, they don\u2019t exist. They can be terminated tomorrow. They can have their top leaders arrested for corruption tomorrow. That\u2019s much more important than any amount of money they can lose in the short term.\u201d\n\nA Chinese flag is seen at the NBA's flagship retail store in Beijing.

Did people stay home out of fear or because they are indeed offended? In a country where facial recognition technology lines the streets, and dissenters disappear with regularity, where Wiebo stands in for Twitter, where internet censors are in a constant war with firewalls and loopholes, it\u2019s impossible to know the truth. That\u2019s intentional. The Chinese government understands that information is power, and it obfuscates information that weakens its own case. Public opinion polls on controversial issues are rarely conducted.\n\nAs Voltaire put it, \u201cTo learn who rules over you, simply find out who you aren\u2019t allowed to criticize.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson the Chinese have known for generations. The NBA and its many corporate spokesmen have adapted and capitulated quickly.\n\nSuddenly, everyone \u2014 from Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, who has been outspoken about domestic issues, to players association president and All-Star Chris Paul \u2014 has more to read and learn before commenting. Stephen Curry feels he doesn\u2019t know enough about the history of China to have a comment. For Kerr, whose father, an academic, was assassinated by terrorists in civil war-torn Beirut, the consequences of speaking up while members of the Lakers, Nets and a horde of NBA employees are in Shanghai may feel closer to home.\n\nJames Harden, a former MVP and the Rockets\u2019 best player whose signature shoe sells in droves in China, apologized to fans and the country. On Wednesday, the league canceled the Lakers\u2019 and Nets\u2019 media availability due to \u201cthe fluidity of the situation.\u201d\n\nEven Silver\u2019s second show of support to Morey, during a press conference in Japan on Tuesday, made sure to give credence to both sides. While one side is in the midst of fighting for its civil liberties, often at the risk of great violence and death, against an encroaching authoritarian regime that has committed human rights atrocities and engaged in propaganda campaigns in order to nullify it, the other side is \u2026 upset that people are upset about it. According to Deadspin, ESPN\u2019s news director released a memo telling employees to avoid political discussions about Hong Kong and China.\n\nMaybe members of the league will make stronger statements once everyone is back across the Pacific. And maybe it\u2019s not on NBA players and coaches to do what no American corporation has done before and leap to the defense of a general manager they owe nothing to in service of an issue they may very well know little about. Or maybe it is, and that\u2019s the cost of global citizenship, which has been exceedingly kind to the pockets of the NBA and its stars.\n\nBut the consistency of that response is what should give us pause. Its uniformity provides a peek into how soft power in authoritarian regimes works to reinforce hard power: the natural byproduct of fear, a seemingly uncalculated split-second of hesitation, the internal dialogue that suggests you should keep reading before commenting, the insistence that more details are required, or even better, that everyone here is just focused on the game, as Sixers coach Brett Brown put it.\n\nAll that, and China Central Television still repudiated Silver\u2019s support for Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression, and announced it wouldn\u2019t broadcast the Lakers-Nets preseason game. Silver, who has landed in Shanghai by now, hopes a face-to-face reconciliation will smooth things over, but contrition may not be enough against a force that feels no need to compromise.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Mired in a controversy of its own making, the NBA is now falling victim to the communist country\u2019s strong-arm tactics.", "authors": ["Seerat Sohi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Im095gh7Od7nfvxVo2vi8Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MzQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JWHR7XTfIoEe6VHgke8IZw--~B/aD0yNjI0O3c9MzU5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a8bb3b00-eadf-11e9-bfaf-968a2aa00762", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
