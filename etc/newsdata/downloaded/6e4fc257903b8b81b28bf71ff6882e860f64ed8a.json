His opening statement suggested that he might have been one of the White House sources for a whistleblower report that kicked off the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThis would all undermine US national security,\u201d Vindman planned to say of Trumps\u2019s 25 July call with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe Times report quoted Vindman\u2019s statement further: \u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics.\n\n\u201cI did convey certain concerns internally to national security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the previous testimony of current and former officials, including the diplomat William Taylor and the Russia expert Fiona Hill, Vindman planned to testify that he was concerned about the role the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was also on the payroll of opaque interests in Ukraine, was playing in crafting US policy towards Ukraine.\n\nVindman also planned to contradict the embattled US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who returned to Capitol Hill on Monday with his lawyers to \u201creview\u201d his testimony of two weeks prior.\n\nIn his testimony before the impeachment investigators, Sondland, who is a hotelier and Trump major-donor, but not a diplomat, reportedly downplayed his role in making Ukraine understand what Trump needed in exchange for military aid, which had already been appropriated by Congress.\n\nVindman was shocked at the linkage between aid and political favors, he planned to testify, and he confronted Sondland the day Sondland spoke in a White House meeting about \u201cUkraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the president\u201d.", "description": "Testimony by Alexander Vindman, an army lieutenant colonel, could weigh heavily in impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d59354e58adaebc3d0c9af7984cab7a81352bc14/0_60_4604_2762/master/4604.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2afbd110caadf73c504945587dcbe47d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
