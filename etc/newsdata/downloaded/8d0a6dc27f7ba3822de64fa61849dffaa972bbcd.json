It is part of a package of evidence that should lead to a positive review for Jeremy.\n\n'It's fair to say when we go back to the CCRC we will have a pretty strong package which we hope they will refer to the Court of Appeal. We hope we will get it across the line.\n\n'If we do, it is probably this country's greatest ever miscarriage of justice.'\n\nThe '3.37am' note was found by Bamber among thousands of police documents he gained access to in 2011.\n\nJurors had been told to disregard Bamber's claims that he called police from his home at 3.36am, and the prosecution said Bamber had invented the call from Nevill to blame Sheila.\n\nLast week ITV announced a drama about the murders with Freddie Fox playing Bamber.\n\nHarrowing: Freddie, left, playing Bamber, then 24, as he recreated the weeping killer's breakdown at the funeral of his parents, sister and her twin sons in 1985\n\nFirst-look images from new drama White House Farm showed Freddie, 30, as the spitting image of Bamber, then 24, as he recreated the weeping killer's breakdown at the funeral of his parents, sister and her twin sons in 1985.\n\nBamber says his sister Sheila, who was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, feared having her children taken into care, suffered a psychotic episode and carried out the murders before turning the gun on herself.\n\nSuspicion turned to Jeremy after the killings.\n\nJeremy Bamber, with his girlfriend Julie Mugford at the funeral of three members of his family\n\nThe police argued that Bamber must have carried out the murders because the gun had been fitted with a silencer, which made it too long for Sheila to be physically able to shoot herself.\n\nThe prosecution's case was that, motivated by the prospect of a huge inheritance, had shot his family with his father's semi-automatic rifle and placed the weapon in his sister's hands to implicate her.\n\nBamber was convicted in 1986 for the murders and has always denied committing the crime.\n\nFor 34 years the case has transfixed Britain as Bamber, now 58, continues to fight to clear his name.\n\nJeremy Bamber is driven away from court to start his life sentence for the murder of his family\n\nBamber is one of the few prisoners in the UK who is serving a whole life prison term. He has always denied committing the crime.\n\nWhen he was convicted by majority verdict at Chelmsford Crown Court on October 28, 1986, he gave little reaction beyond slumping slightly in his seat.\n\nSentencing him to five life prison terms, judge Justice Drake said: 'I find it difficult to foresee whether it will ever be safe to release someone who can shoot two little boys as they lie asleep in their beds.'\n\nSuspicion first fell on Bamber when scratch marks were found on a kitchen shelf above the Aga, allegedly caused by a silencer fitted to the murder weapon.\n\nThe silencer was later found in a gun cupboard, and police deduced it would have been impossible for Mrs Caffell to return it there after shooting herself.\n\nThey concluded Bamber carried out the murders after a violent struggle in the kitchen with his father during which the shelf was scratched.\n\nHis ex girlfriend Julie - who he split from one month after the murders - made statements saying Jeremy had told her he hired a hitman to kill his family before saying he had made clear his intentions to end the lives of his family to her on multiple occasions.\n\nVictim: Essex Police initially believed that Sheila, who had mental health problems, had murdered her own family before turning the gun on herself but the prosecution disagreed\n\nIt was argued that the extra length attached onto the rifle meant Caffell would not have been able to turn the gun on herself and then place it in the cupboard.\n\nThe jury was told there was blood on the silencer which came from Caffell and that there was red nail paint on a cupboard, indicating a struggle between herself and the attacker.\n\nAnother point of contention was whether Bamber had received a phone call from his father on the night of the murders - in which he alleged Nevill said Sheila had 'gone berserk' with a gun.\n\nHe said that he alerted police and that Sheila fired a final shot while he spoke to officers outside the house.\n\nTragedy: Jeremy's adoptive parents, Nevill and June Bamber,both aged 61 at the time of their deaths, were also killed in the massacre during the night of 6\u20137 August 1985\n\nThe prosecution argued that Bamber's father had not made any call and that the only way Bamber would have known about the shootings was because he was the killer.\n\nHowever an alleged police log was unearthed in 2010 by Bamber's defence team, timed at 03.26am, in which Nevill Bamber said his daughter had 'gone berserk' and 'got hold of one of my guns.'\n\nTitled 'Daughter gone berserk', it said: 'Mr Bamber ... White House Farm ... daughter Sheila Bamber aged 26 years has got hold of one of my guns.'\n\nBamber has also claimed for many years that evidence was not disclosed to the defence by Essex police showing that two silencers had been examined by forensic scientists.\n\nPrison: Between 2002-2012 Bamber has launched several unsuccessful appeals to prove his innocence (pictured 2013)\n\nThe convicted killer has repeatedly challenged the verdict and in 2009 lost a Court of Appeal case against the order that he must die behind bars.\n\nIn 2002 a team of Scotland Yard detectives conducted a fresh investigation, and concluded that blood on the silencer of the gun matched Sheila.\n\nThe silencer was found in a downstairs cupboard, and with Sheila's body found upstairs, police concluded she could not have been the killer.\n\nIn September 2018 the CPS said: 'We have received correspondence relating to this case and requested additional material in order to respond to the points raised.\n\n'Jeremy Bamber's conviction has been the subject of several appeals and reviews by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and there has never been anything to suggest that he was wrongly convicted.'\n\n", "description": "Bamber is serving a full life tariff for killing his family in Essex.
