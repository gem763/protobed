One way to experience it is with a stay at one of the city's many boutique hotels.\n\nLocated in Hanoi's Old Quarter -- a network of 36 streets, organized by trade -- these quaint addresses combine modern amenities with historic atmosphere for an authentic base while exploring the city.\n\nHere are eight of the best when you travel here:\n\n1. Hotel de l'Opera\n\nThe terrace at Hotel de l'Opera Hanoi.

Rest assured, however, that all four l'Opera Grand Suites offer views of the Opera House.\n\nWithin minutes of leaving the hotel, guests will discover the city's central lake, bustling Old Quarter and countless bars and restaurants.\n\nHotel de l'Opera , 29 Trang Tien Street, Hoan Kiem District; +84 4 6282 5555\n\n2.
