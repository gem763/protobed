She was a good student and she loved her puppies,\u201d the grandmother, Cynthia Rivera, told KTRK. \u201cWe got her back damaged.\u201d\n\nSerrano took her own life on October 12 after she locked herself in the bathroom early that morning, according to her father, Mariano Serrano.\n\n\u201cShe died in my arms,\u201d Serrano said in Spanish, fighting back tears during an interview with Fox 26.\n\nHe added that he believed Letty was never over being away from her trafficker.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to be with him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, she also didn\u2019t want to hurt her family.\u201d\n\nRivera and Serrano told Fox 26 they searched for Letty for days after her trafficker took her from a location near a middle school in North Houston in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe were able to locate her and call [police] and have this animal arrested,\u201d Rivera explained.\n\nHowever, she said, her trafficker was let go after a few days and after her rescue, Letty ran away from home twice to be with him. They said they believed the trafficker worked with at least three other men to move her around and drug her.\n\nRivera also said they preyed on her vulnerabilities. \u201c[She was] quiet, kind of a loner and her brother had just passed. She was a perfect target for them.\u201d\n\nFox News recently examined the issue of vulnerability and targeting in a recent interview with famed model Kathy Ireland and in its coverage of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nOver 200,000 victims are trafficked in the state of Texas at any given time, nearly 80,000 of them minors, according to a report by the state attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nLetta\u2019s experience in the dark trade of sex trafficking is an all-too-common tale in Texas and across the United States.\n\n\u201cHe really did take on that daddy-figure role, then at 10, started sexually abusing me and trafficking me. That literally wrecked my world, my whole life,\u201d Edie Rhea, a survivor of sex trafficking and advocate for victims, told Fox News back in May 2019 as part of a multi-part investigation into human trafficking by Fox News Channel.\n\nSEE THAT WORK HERE: PARTS ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX\n\nRhea\u2019s father died when she was 4 years old, leaving her mother with three young girls. Her mother\u2019s boyfriend became a father figure to Rhea \u2013 and used that trust to exploit her. She said he would sell her for sex out of the meat-packaging store that her family owned.\n\n\u201cHe would take me to somebody\u2019s home. They could come to where I lived,\u201d Rhea said. \u201cWe had a meat store, so a lot of people would purchase me out of the meat store. Sometimes I would have to have sex with them in the meat store, where the frozen meat was.\u201d\n\nRhea has rebounded from her tumultuous youth but said it really took her until a decade after she escaped to become a well-adjusted member of society. Since then, she's worked at an all-girls safe home for survivors of trafficking in Florida.\n\nRhea\u2019s story is unique to her, and no two trafficking stories are identical \u2013 but common threads exist among most survivors.\n\n\u201cMost of the victims are folks that are in such a vulnerable position they are not able to make their own decisions,\u201d William Sweeney, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s New York division, told Fox News during the investigative series. \u201cIt\u2019s often targeting the most vulnerable in society.\u201d\n\nOthers have said the most innocent could be caught up in trafficking rings.\n\n\u201cI was violently raped,\u201d Brook Bello, another Florida-based trafficking advocate, told Fox News back in May. \u201c[I was a] baseball player, a straight-A student, science buff, not the kind of kid who you would think would get caught up into what we now call human trafficking.\u201d\n\nThe United States has been ranked as one of the worst countries in the world for human trafficking. According to a report by the State Department, the top three nations of origin for victims of human trafficking in 2018 were the United States, Mexico and the Philippines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast June, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered the Trafficking in Persons report, which the State Department releases annually to document human trafficking in the year prior. The latest report highlighted the growing focus that government agencies and nonprofit organizations have dedicated to stopping human trafficking.\n\nThe report found that children in foster care, homeless youth, children in the U.S. illegally and those with substance abuse problems were especially at risk to fall into the human-trafficking trap.\n\nFox News\u2019 Andrew Keiper contributed to this report.\n\nIf you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "description": "A Houston girl took her own life two years after escaping the clutches of sex trafficking, shining a light on the crisis.", "authors": ["Perry Chiaramonte", "Perry Chiaramonte Is A Producer With Fox News Channel'S Investigative Unit.
