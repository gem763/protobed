And if I can\u2019t, I think it\u2019s really tough to conceive of continuing,\u201d de Blasio told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019m looking at it right now.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio has forged ahead with his campaign for the Democratic nomination despite failing to top 1 percent in most polls, and getting shut out of the third round of debates scheduled for next week. Wednesday\u2019s comments were the first time he suggested an end date for a campaign that has struggled to capture attention nationally and continues to be a source of criticism back home.\n\nA fourth debate, set for mid-October, will have the same requirements to qualify as the September debate: candidates must reach 2 percent in four-DNC approved polls and receive donations from 130,000 unique donors. Another New York politician, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, exited the primary stage last week after failing to qualify for the upcoming debate.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
