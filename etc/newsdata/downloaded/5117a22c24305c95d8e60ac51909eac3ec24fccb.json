Swap and share clothes\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of clothes swaps,\u201d says Lauren Bravo. \u201cThere\u2019s an organisation called Swap Rebellion that organise clothes swaps in London at the moment. If you look locally to you, there are organisations all over the country, people who are setting up their own clothes swapping events. That can be a great way of getting a new wardrobe without having to buy anything new.\"\n\nWe get sucked into buying the deals we see, for example, buy one get one free. Only purchase what you actually need. Kate Cawley, owner of Veris Strategies, a sustainability agency\n\n\"Next time you need an outfit for a party, or an event, send a message out on WhatsApp, talk to your friends, see if people can lend you some clothes. We don\u2019t need a new outfit for every single wedding. Think about borrowing from other people before you go and buy.\u201d\n\n5. Only buy what food you need\n\n\u201cFood waste is a massive issue,\u201d says Kate Cawley. \u201cWe get sucked into buying the deals we see, for example, buy one get one free. So only purchase what you actually need and value the food more and don\u2019t waste it.\u201d\n\n6. Get crafty with a needle\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not expecting people to get dress-making from scratch...but if you can master just a few really basic sewing skills...that can make a massive difference to how often your clothes get worn,\u201d says Lauren Bravo.\n\n\u201cHave a look on YouTube, there are loads of tutorials on there. If you\u2019re prepared to alter your clothes, even things like putting up a hem, taking off a collar, changing some sleeves, things like that...and being prepared to mend clothes when they wear out. When you\u2019ve got a hole in something, got a stain down something, don\u2019t throw it away, don\u2019t give up on it, think about how you can adapt it and still get some wear out of it.\u201d\n\n7. Moderate your meat and dairy intake\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to moderate your meat and dairy intake because that does naturally have a higher carbon footprint - you\u2019re raising an animal,\u201d says Kate Cawley. \u201cWe need to embrace a more plant-based lifestyle. I think there is an important role for meat and dairy but I think it\u2019s about buying better as well.\u201d\n\n8. Look for sustainable fashion brands\n\n\u201cThere are some exciting sustainable brands coming along,\u201d according to Lauren Bravo. \u201cSome of them can be more expensive, so it\u2019s certainly not an ideal solution for everybody yet. But there are some wonderful brands.\"\n\n\"One of my favourites is Birdsong London - they work with groups of female refugees in London who are trained up to hand paint T-shirts and to sew clothes. They are paid a fair living wage, it\u2019s a positive working environment, the clothes are fantastic, they are very much designed for all women\u2019s bodies. They have a \u2018no Photoshop\u2019 and \u2018no sweatshop\u2019 motto which is brilliant. There\u2019s lots of other websites around. Follow some sustainable fashion hashtags - that can be a good way of discovering new sustainable brands you haven\u2019t heard of.\u201d", "description": "Tips for how to reduce your effect on the environment from three Woman's Hour guests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07mw42k.jpg"}
