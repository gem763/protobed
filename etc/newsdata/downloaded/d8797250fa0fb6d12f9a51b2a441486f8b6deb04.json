Black Mirror is officially happening guys. It\u2019s here.\u2019\n\nAfter the Flack Attack returned serve with a sassy quip, she\u2019s now gone further in defending the programme.\n\n\u2018As you know self image is a complicated, sensitive and personal subject,\u2019 she wrote on Twitter overnight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018At the heart of this show are people not contestants who have sought help to want to better them selves in their own eyes.\n\n\u2018Their stories deserve to be told and not ridiculed online.\u2019\n\nHer message followed Jameela\u2019s response to Dr Tijion Esho, who said he pulled out of being the show\u2019s doctor after discovering the whole premise.\n\nJameela wrote: \u2018This is why I said it was like Black Mirror @carolineflack1.\n\nCaroline is back with another hosting gig (Picture: Channel 4)roline flack\n\n\u2018Because it\u2019s a VERY surreal concept that (perhaps unintentionally) will prey on people\u2019s insecurities. I think of the effect on teenagers of the messaging of this. Fingers crossed it doesn\u2019t affect anyone negatively.\u2019\n\nWhile it\u2019s true, we\u2019re not going to know the whole vibe of the show, whether it\u2019s dangerous for self-esteem and body image or not, Channel 4 said of the series: \u2018From bum-lifts to nose jobs, sculpted abs to breast enlargements, The Surjury allows people to explore their choices more thoroughly.\u2019\n\nWhile Ross McCarthy, executive producer for show creators Gobstopper Television, added: \u2018This is a totally new way of doing peer-to- peer advice.\n\n\u2018Our pitchers will either get the surgery they\u2019ve always wanted, or a massive boost in confidence when the public rules they don\u2019t need work at all!\u2019\n\nAs the stars went head to head over the show, Channel 4 defended the premise amidst the controversy, saying: \u2018Rather than wag a disapproving finger, this new series looks at who wants it, and why \u2013 and allows those who make a strong enough case to their peers, to undergo the procedure of their choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The show will neither glamorise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities.\n\n\u2018All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord.\u2019\n\nGuess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n\nThe Surjury airs in 2020 on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
