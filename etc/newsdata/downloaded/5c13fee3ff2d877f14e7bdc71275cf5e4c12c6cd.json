I wanted to make sure I used the same pair I'd wear for race day during my training and went to a running store soon after signing up to get properly fitted for a new pair.\n\nWhile some people always splurge on sneakers, I typically bought running shoes on sale for around $50 to $60, which was really all I needed to spend for the light running I was doing prior to the marathon. After visiting a legitimate running store, getting my feet measured, and talking with seasoned runners, I quickly realized the unexpected cost of sneakers.\n\nSources recommend replacing your running shoes roughly every six months or every 300 miles \u2014 both of these metrics correspond with training for a marathon, so it's worth investing in a new pair soon after signing up.\n\nAt specialty running shops, sales associates observe how you run and examine your current pair of sneakers to help you pick which new pair will work best.
