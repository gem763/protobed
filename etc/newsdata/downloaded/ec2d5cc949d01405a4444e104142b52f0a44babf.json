Severely weakened by the five-year military campaign that forced it underground in March, the extremist group remains a potent threat after reverting to insurgency while seeking to inspire attacks globally.\n\n\u201cO soldiers of Allah everywhere, know that what is coming is good\u2026so the efforts must be redoubled and one\u2019s best must be given in all aspects, whether in preaching or media or military or security,\u201d Baghdadi said in a 30-minute recording, according to monitoring group SITE Intelligence.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear when exactly the audio was produced, but Baghdadi referred to an Islamic State campaign in August, according to SITE. The Wall Street Journal couldn\u2019t independently confirm if the voice in the recording was that of Baghdadi.\n\nThe 48-year-old Islamic State leader has evaded capture despite the efforts of the world\u2019s intelligence agencies and a $25 million bounty. Iraqi intelligence believes Baghdadi is hunkered down in the vast desert spanning the border between Iraq with Syria.\n\nThe audio recording\u2019s release comes amid rising fears of a broader conflict breaking out in the region after the U.S. blamed Iran for attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure over the weekend. Tehran has denied involvement.\n\nWestern and regional military commanders have warned that tensions between Iran and the U.S. are detracting from efforts to prevent Islamic State rebuilding.\n\nIslamic State supporters took to social media after the speech was released, posting photographs of handwritten notes hailing Baghdadi that purportedly came from Turkey, Gaza, Egypt and Sudan.\n\nBaghdadi said the U.S. was \u201cdrowning in a quagmire\u201d and \u201cbeing bled along with its proxies\u201d on battlefields stretching from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, West and Central Africa, East Asia and North Africa.\n\nHassan Hassan, director of the Nonstate Actors Program at the Center for Global Policy and co-author of a book about Islamic State, said the speech was more focused on the region than any other since the group proclaimed its caliphate in 2014, noting Baghdadi had hardly mentioned the West.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that ISIS, like al Qaeda and its offshoots since 2011, will increasingly focus on countries in the Middle East and the wider region, rather than on conducting attacks on the West,\u201d he said, using ISIS as an abbreviation for Islamic State.\n\nA report to Congress by the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Inspector General in August assessed that Islamic State militants were strengthening their capability to carry out attacks in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe report said the group\u2019s determination to make a comeback\u2014and the difficulties encountered by U.S.- backed forces in Iraq and Syria in holding ground in remote areas\u2014had provided a fresh opening for the militants.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report linked Islamic State\u2019s resurgence to Trump administration decisions to reduce U.S. forces in Syria, shrink the American diplomatic presence in Iraq and diverting reconnaissance systems to efforts to monitor Iranian activity in the region.\n\nIt estimated the number of Islamic State members at between 14,000 and 18,000 in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreigners, though government estimates vary.\n\n\u2014Nazih Osseiran in Beirut and Ghassan Adnan in Baghdad contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Isabel Coles at isabel.coles@wsj.com", "description": "Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ordered his followers to redouble their efforts to further the extremist group\u2019s cause, in an audio message apparently aimed at raising morale after it lost control over its self-proclaimed caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq earlier this year.", "authors": ["Isabel Coles", "Isabel.Coles Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107630/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
