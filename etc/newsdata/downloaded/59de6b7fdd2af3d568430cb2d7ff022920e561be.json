The assault has led outraged women to march in the streets in major cities and rally behind an online campaign called #AmINext.\n\nA post on the royals\u2019 Instagram account called the death \u201ca critical point in the future of women\u2019s rights in South Africa\u201d and said the visit was \u201cpersonally important\u201d to Meghan.\n\nThe duchess also has spoken with Mrwetyana\u2019s mother, the post said, adding that \u201cthe Duke and Duchess had been following what had happened from afar and were both eager to learn more when they arrived in South Africa.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 rapes are reported every day in South Africa, and President Cyril Ramaphosa calls the country \u201cone of the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman.\u201d He announced new emergency measures and vowed to be tougher on perpetrators, but some women weary of years of such pronouncements have suggested that South Africa bring back the death penalty for rapists.\n\nThe scope of the problem is well-known. More than 2,700 women were murdered in South Africa last year, and more than 1,000 children, the government says. One in five women over age 18 have faced physical violence from a partner.\n\nWomen\u2019s empowerment is one of the many issues that Meghan and Prince Harry are highlighting on their first official tour as a family with their baby, Archie. The 10-day, multi-country visit continued on Saturday for Harry with a meeting in Angola with the president of the southern African nation.\n\nThe prince on Friday followed in the footsteps of his late mother, Princess Diana, whose walk through an active mine field in Angola years ago helped to lead to a global ban on the deadly weapons.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has visited a memorial to a young South African woman whose rape and murder inspired thousands of people to protest the country's high rate of sexual violence.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/africa_royals_visit_75121_c0-737-3475-2763_s1770x1032.jpg?12281db087a3e1ca05e4c475ca1b91ed286f148b", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
