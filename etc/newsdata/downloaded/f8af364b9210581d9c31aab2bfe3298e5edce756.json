The nation\u2019s largest abortion provider filed the federal lawsuit in January 2016.\n\n\u201cIt is not about the truth of whether plaintiffs profited from the sale of fetal tissue or otherwise violated the law in securing tissue for those programs,\u201d Judge Orrick wrote in jury instructions. \u201cIt is not about whether any plaintiff actually engaged in illegal conduct. Those issues are a matter of dispute between the parties in the world outside this courtroom.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Times, Mr. Daleiden said the upcoming trial is about defending First Amendment rights in exposing the abortion industry.\n\n\u201cYou know at the end of the day what\u2019s happening here is that free speech and free reporting are going on trial in San Francisco,\u201d said Mr. Daleiden, who founded the Center for Medical Progress in 2013.\n\nPlanned Parenthood originally had sought $20 million in damages for fraud and trespassing. In July, Judge Orrick reduced potential damages to $100,000, ruling that the reproductive health provider could not seek to bill Mr. Daleiden and his organization for the costs of security upgrades at clinics in the aftermath of the videos going viral.\n\n\u201cThe case has been massively cut down in all directions, which has good and bad aspects to it,\u201d Mr. Daleiden said. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s kind of a positive because it recognizes that this really isn\u2019t a real lawsuit [and] that Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t really have a case.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood says the covertly filmed videos violate California\u2019s law requiring consent by all parties to be recorded. It says the videos led to a 2015 shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where three people were killed and nine others were wounded.\n\nDefense attorneys argue that Mr. Daleiden, Ms. Merritt and others were acting as investigative journalists who were working to inform law enforcement of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood in trying to profit on the sale of fetal body parts. No criminal charges have been brought against the abortion provider.\n\nAccording to Judge Orrick\u2019s jury instructions, some legal issues already have been decided: The defendants are liable for trespassing and fraudulently breaking vendor agreements in their undercover work at the National Abortion Federation\u2019s 2014 meeting in San Francisco. They interviewed Planned Parenthood doctors there and at restaurants in Los Angeles in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe judge said the jury\u2019s task will be to decide whether any harm came from the trespassing and whether any damages should be assessed.\n\nAccording to preliminary court filings, both sides will be allowed to discuss in a limited manner the merits of research using fetal tissue. A tentative schedule shows that the first witness \u2014 an official with the National Abortion Federation \u2014 is expected to testify on Friday.\n\nThe civil trial is expected to last through early November.\n\nA separate, criminal case against Mr. Daleiden also is headed to trial. The state of California has charged him with violating privacy and eavesdropping laws in secretly filming Planned Parenthood officials. Mr. Daleiden could face prison time in that case.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
