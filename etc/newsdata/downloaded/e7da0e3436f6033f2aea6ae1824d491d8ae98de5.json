The victim, who was working as a security guard, was called for questioning in a murder case \u2013 but the bruises on the dead body tell a different story. Rather than interrogation, the police appear to have subjected 35-year-old Pradeep Tomar to torture. Three cops have been suspended, but this may only be a token gesture to fob off protests. The policemen must be tried for murder and an independent investigation undertaken into the crime.\n\nAmong poorly trained, overworked, short staffed and feudal minded police personnel, custodial torture is sine qua non for interrogation because they do not possess the tools to solve crimes. Beating a confession out of an accused is easier work than taxing the brains and undertaking scientific inquiries. Of course, to put an end to the torture most suspects confess to anything the police require. Even those who end up dead like Tomar are often written off as suicide in custody, or death due to comorbidities, to save the erring cops.\n\nA weak criminal justice delivery system where magistrates lackadaisically perform their duty of keeping oversight on police sustains the abuse. Magistrates who keep a close watch on signs of physical torture on those under custodial remand can deter torture. Likewise, state governments who have full political control over police are complicit in the acts of torture if they cannot deter the psychopaths within the force. Custodial torture has no place in civilised societies, and should be treated as beyond the pale.", "description": "A shocking case of custodial death reported from Hapur in western Uttar Pradesh, in which a ten-year-old boy sat outside a police station while his father was being tortured by cops, puts the state\u2019s police...", "authors": ["Toi Edit"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/toiedit-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
