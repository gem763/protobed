You can also download a PDF of the resolution.\n\nThe measure directs the Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Adam Schiff, to hold open hearings in the investigation, with equal time for questioning allotted to majority and minority members of the committee or staff. Both the chairman and the ranking member, or designated staff members, would have 45 minutes to question witnesses in 5-minute increments before questioning by other members.\n\nThe resolution also gives the top Republican on the committee, ranking member Devin Nunes, the ability to submit requests for witnesses with \"a detailed written justification of the relevance of the testimony\" by each witness. Schiff would be able to decline Nunes' request, with Nunes able to refer the request to the full committee for a vote. The resolution also gives Nunes the authority to issue subpoenas to compel testimony from his witnesses, and Schiff the authority to release transcripts of closed-door depositions.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee would then draft a report of its findings in consultation with the chairs of Foreign Affairs and Oversight, and transmit the report to the Judiciary Committee, as well as relevant investigatory material the committee collected.\n\nOnce the Intelligence Committee has transmitted its findings, the Judiciary Committee would take the lead on proceedings pursuant to procedures set by the Rules Committee, \"including such procedures as to allow for the participation of the President and his counsel.\" The top Republican would also have the ability to request witnesses, following the same process as the Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee would then \"report to the House of Representatives such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper.\"\n\nThe Rules Committee is scheduled to meet to \"mark up\" the resolution with amendments on Wednesday afternoon, and Democratic leaders hope to vote on the measure on Thursday.\n\nThe White House reacted to the resolution later Tuesday, saying it shows the inquiry \"has been an illegitimate sham from the start.\"\n\n\"The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven't been written,\" press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\n\"This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the Administration,\" she added.", "description": "\"The next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the President's misconduct\"", "authors": ["Stefan Becket"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/59d92be4-57f6-4e7b-a22a-474e71cf6af0/thumbnail/1200x630g2/c0f155568e3b1c7dce3dd8023dac780e/gettyimages-1181319627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
