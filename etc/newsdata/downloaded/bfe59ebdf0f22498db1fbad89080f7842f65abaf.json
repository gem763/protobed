O\u2019Rourke\u2019s cri de coeur last night about yanking AR-15s out of their owners\u2019 hands happened to come just one day after the NYT published this piece reporting that House Dems have dropped their push for an assault-weapons ban \u2014 even though they\u2019re just seven votes shy of a House majority. That\u2019s quintessential Pelosi, not wanting to spend political capital on a measure that can\u2019t possibly become law and which would risk spooking right-wingers into higher turnout next fall, putting moderate Dems in purple districts in even greater danger. Nancy\u2019s plan on gun control is the same as Nancy\u2019s plan on impeachment: Play it safe. Do a little something to make your base happy but don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s likely to enrage the opposition without producing anything meaningful for your side.\n\nThen along came Beto last night and Leeroy-Jenkinsed her plan on live national television.\n\n\u201cThat clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies,\u201d said Dem Sen. Chris Coons to CNN this morning of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s vow to confiscate assault weapons. (The full clip is below). Other centrists who have spent months trying to midwife a compromise in the Senate on more modest legislation involving background checks were mortified by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s display:\n\n\u201cThis is an awful and extreme idea. Thankfully, there\u2019s not enough support in Congress to do it. But this rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks,\u201d [Pat Toomey] tweeted. A Democratic aide said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments \u201conly feeds into the NRA\u2019s narrative that Democrats are going to take away your guns.\u201d \u201cIf Beto wants to actually solve of these problems, he should help negotiate or encourage his colleagues to pass common-sense background checks,\u201d the aide said, adding, \u201cif Beto really wanted to help, he would end his failing presidential campaign and run for Senate and give Democrats the vote they\u2019d need.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t understand the sneering reference to the \u201cNRA\u2019s narrative\u201d that Democrats are coming to take your guns. Democrats are, in fact, coming to take your guns and O\u2019Rourke did gun-rights supporters a favor by dispensing with the subterfuge, notes NRO:\n\nFor years, advocates of the right to keep and bear arms have suspected that confiscation was the endgame but have been rebuffed as paranoiacs in the press. Such a rebuffing is no longer possible. If it ever was, \u201cNobody is coming for your guns!\u201d is no longer true \u2014 which means that a host of commonly posed inquiries now have the same simple answer. \u201cWhy do you oppose federal licensing?\u201d Because leading Democrats are threatening confiscation. \u201cWhy do you oppose \u2018universal\u2019 background checks?\u201d Because they would create a registry. \u201cAnd why do you oppose a registry?\u201d Because leading Democrats are threatening confiscation. Unwittingly or not, O\u2019Rourke and his acolytes have stuck a dagger into the exquisitely calibrated gun-control messaging on which their party has worked for the better part of 20 years. No voter can now say he wasn\u2019t warned.\n\nIf it\u2019s just an \u201cNRA narrative\u201d that Democrats are coming to take your guns, how do we explain this data published a few days ago?\n\nDare I say it but it appears as though Democrats are interested in taking your guns. Good luck convincing Trump to sign a bill expanding background checks now that Beto\u2019s set the terms of the debate for the right this way.\n\nI\u2019ll give you two devil\u2019s-advocate arguments for why O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Leeroy Jenkins moment may not have been a total disaster for lefties, though. First, he probably did help move the proverbial Overton window on gun control to the left. Medicare for All was once a nonfactor in the health-care debate; Bernie kept talking about it; today it\u2019s the favored plan of various Democratic candidates for president. With any wacky progressive proposal, someone has to be the first to champion it on a big stage. Beto\u2019s that guy on gun confiscation, even if he ends up doing more harm short-term than good.\n\nSecond, righties shouldn\u2019t be sanguine about the likelihood of modest gun control passing over the next few years, starting with background checks. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s soundbite will be useful in rallying the right but there\u2019ll be more mass shootings and those will galvanize gun-grabbers to try again. It\u2019s fine for Ted Cruz to play to the base by warning Trump that any form of regulation will lead to his defeat but there are too many polls showing the immense popularity of expanded background checks to delay it forever. The next Democratic-controlled government will easily get it done, and may even have public support to nuke the filibuster in the name of doing it if need be.", "description": "\"I don't think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
