And frankly, those are some of the most expensive parts of the market.\u201d\n\nInvestors have to \u201cthread the needle\u201d and find lower beta stocks \u2014 that is, companies that are less volatile \u2014 that are still cyclical, he says. Such a path leads to value stocks, which have been on a roll. Since Monday, momentum stocks (those that had been showing strong price strength) have dropped around 10% while value has rallied about 7%, according to J.P. Morgan data.\n\nLafferty isn\u2019t willing to proclaim the end of the momentum cycle. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to say that the 7-, 8-year trend has changed, based on four days worth of data.\u201d\n\nAny talk of value quite naturally leads to a discussion of financial stocks. Financial stocks XLF, +0.57% have a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.5. \u201cPeople say, financial earnings are impaired. My answer to that is, yeah, and the P/Es more than reflect that,\u201d Lafferty said.\n\nIf there is a recession \u2014 and Lafferty just expects a slowdown \u2014 financial stocks are pricing that in, whereas many other sectors are not.\n\nWhile not as cheap as it was before the talk of recession and inverted yield curves bid up the yellow metal, gold GC00, +0.52% is still a \u201creasonably good\u201d defensive play, he says. \u201cThe opportunity cost to using gold as a hedge has been falling as interest rates have plunged,\u201d he said.\n\nThe buzz\n\nThe European Central Bank will be deciding on interest rates with expectations the central bank will announce other easing measures, including further bond purchases. Lafferty doesn\u2019t expect much of an economic boost to come out of it. \u201cOnce you make money free, it gets a little harder to entice consumers and corporations to continue to borrow, either to spend or to hire new workers, expand plant and equipment, buy new software,\u201d he said. China may announce a rate-cutting \u201croad map\u201d next week, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nPresident Trump overnight tweeted a delay to tariffs on Chinese goods by two weeks, the latest measure taken by the two sides to de-escalate the trade conflict ahead of talks in October. Consumer price data for August and the latest jobless claims report are due from the U.S.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev BUD, +0.07% is continuing to explore a potential IPO of its Asia Pacific unit, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.72% has typically climbed in the one month following these \u201cmore extreme drawdowns in momentum,\u201d according to The Market Ear newsletter.\n\nRandom reads\n\nThe Financial Times did a deep dive into China\u2019s war on Uighur culture.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen.
