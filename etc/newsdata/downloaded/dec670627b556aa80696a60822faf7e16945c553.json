This time it\u2019s strictly for adults, and the creators behind the scenes seem to understand Harley\u2019s unique place in the universe.\n\nWe got a sneak peek at the first episode of Harley Quinn at San Diego Comic-Con and were impressed with what we saw, so we couldn\u2019t wait to talk to showrunners-executive producers Justin Halpern and Patrick Schumacker about it at New York Comic Con. We covered her toxic relationship with the Joker, the enormous cast of the animated series, and their own emancipation of Harley Quinn.\n\nWe\u2019ll have more with Halpern and Schumacker as we get closer to the series\u2019 release.\n\nJustin Halpern: Yeah, definitely. I mean, our idea was when you\u2019re so wrapped up in someone else\u2019s identity when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone who\u2019s larger than life and kind of toxic, like when you \u2014 or toxic, not kind of [laughs] \u2014 when you extricate yourself from that relationship there\u2019s this like void and you sort of, for the first time, ask yourself, \u201cWell, what do I want since I\u2019m not answering to somebody else anymore?\u201d And so that was an interesting idea for us, and kind of like where our jumping-off point is.\n\nPatrick Schumacker: There\u2019s a lot of that going on with the character now. We\u2019re telling our own version of it. It was developed kind of independently of the Birds of Prey film, but that\u2019s also kinda focusing on, it\u2019s in the title, The Emancipation of Harley Quinn.\n\nWe pitched this show three years ago to Warner Brothers, and we\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, we wanna tell a story about Harley staking out on her own. Our version of the character is like a psychotic Mary Tyler Moore who is like upbeat, girl in the big city trying to make it, but she\u2019s trying to make it by murdering fools [laughs]. So, yeah, that\u2019s the focus of the first season is her climbing the ladder of the criminal underworld of Gotham City.\n\nWell the interesting thing to me is how, you know, she had villainous origins, of course, in the, you know, Batman: The Animated Series she was just the Joker\u2019s sidekick. Always a villain until the New 52 came around, and what Jimmy [Palmiotti] and Amanda [Conner] were doing with the Coney Island stuff and kinda turning her into an antihero. Our show wants to focus on her criminal roots for sure.\n\nWe were like, \u201cMaybe she goes there later\u201d to the antihero stuff. Our show takes place in Gotham, it is all the familiar Rogues Gallery from Batman surrounding her and then some. We kinda have a giant sandbox to play in, as the trailer hopefully conveys.\n\nHalpern: She is a bad guy in our show and we wanted to keep her that way, and I think part of the reason why I feel like people gravitate towards the character and it\u2019s become so big is... she\u2019s like inherently fun. So I don\u2019t think you could make like a Harley Quinn movie that wasn\u2019t fun, or Harley Quinn show that wasn\u2019t fun, because the character\u2019s so inherently fun. And she has like no impulse control, and there\u2019s a lot of wish fulfillment.\n\nThe voice cast is insane. It\u2019s definitely by far the best cast we\u2019ve ever worked with in any of the shows we\u2019ve done, I mean.\n\nSchumacker: The largest cast we\u2019ve ever worked with. [laughs]\n\nHalpern: Yeah, it was one of those things where we kept saying, usually when you\u2019re on a network sitcom or you\u2019re on a show, you throw out the actor you wish you\u2019d get and then you actually get a different actor. [laughs] And in this case we kept being like, \u201cOh, it would be great if Jason Alexander did this character.\u201d And then we sent him the material and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nSchumacker: He\u2019s Sy Borgman.\n\nHalpern: Yeah, and like Lake Bell as Poison Ivy, it\u2019s like Lake said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Wanda Sykes is in it. I mean we just had Matt Oberg, we had just a crazy...\n\nSchumacker: J.B. Smoove, did you say?\n\nHalpern: Yeah, no, I didn\u2019t.\n\nSchumacker: J.B. Smoove plays an original character named Frank the Plant who is a talking Venus Flytrap, one of Ivy\u2019s creations.\n\nGizmodo: Nice.\n\nSchumacker: So he\u2019s great.\n\nHalpern: I mean we just felt like so lucky to have these people come in. And I think part of the fun for them is like our show is very... Like the dialog is very natural and overlappy and because of that we let the actors improv, and they don\u2019t get to do a lot of that in animation, but our show they did, and so I think they just had like a lot of fun, and they would tell other actors, \u201cThis is fun, come in and do it.\u201d", "description": "Harley Quinn is basically everywhere you look today and we\u2019re about to get a fresh new animated incarnation of the DC character.
