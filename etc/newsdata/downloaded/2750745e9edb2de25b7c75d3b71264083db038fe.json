Johnson delighted eurosceptic Conservatives by lampooning the EU bureaucracy with outrageous and often fictitious dispatches from Brussels.\n\nAs mayor of London (2008\u20132016), Johnson thrived in the public-facing role while delegating most day-to-day responsibility.\n\nAs foreign secretary (2016\u20132018), he was accused of spurning briefings and leaning on charm to conduct diplomacy, with mixed results.\n\nWhen May's position became untenable, the job was Johnson's to lose. Rather than offer alternative proposals, though, he has offered alternative emotions.\n\nIn a Daily Telegraph column Monday, Johnson argued that if the U.S. could put a man on the Moon 50 years ago, surely the U.K. could overcome the \"technical and logistical\" challenges of leaving the EU.\n\n\"There is no task so simple that government cannot overcomplicate if it doesn\u2019t want to do it,\" he declared. \"And there are few tasks so complex that humanity cannot solve if we have a real sense of mission to pull them off.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Johnson's political appeal blends humor with Churchillian grandeur, often unencumbered by reality.\n\nOn Brexit, the Telegraph's Peter Foster reports that the \"question being asked around Europe is whether Mr. Johnson wants a deal at all.\"\n\nJohnson says a \"no-deal\" divorce \u2014 which would have major economic repercussions for the U.K. and the world \u2014 is preferable to another delay. A parliamentary majority is prepared to block it, however.\n\nA rebellion is already growing within the Conservative ranks over no-deal, with outgoing Finance Minister Philip Hammond as an unlikely resistance leader.\n\nThe bottom line: All of this means a collision is coming between now and October. Johnson argued in his column, as he has throughout his career, that what's missing from the top ranks of British politics is \"can-do spirit.\" We'll soon see if it makes all the difference.\n\nGo deeper: Everything you need to know about Brexit", "description": "He won the Conservative Party's leadership in a widely expected result.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/iUa7_X_QOBinsz8c9q4XH-ASRX0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/07/23/1563848239319.png", "published_at": "2019-07-23"}
