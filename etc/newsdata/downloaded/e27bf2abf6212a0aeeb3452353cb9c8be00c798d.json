South Singapore also recorded the highest 1-hour PM2.5 reading of 64, which is in the elevated band.\n\nPM2.5 is the main air pollutant during the haze season, and NEA recommends checking the 1-hour PM2.5 concentration readings as an indicator of current air quality for immediate activities such as going for a jog.\n\nAir quality in Singapore at 12pm on September 13, 2019. NEA\n\nAccording to NEA, Singapore experienced slight haziness on Thursday due to smoke haze from hotspots in central and southern Sumatra being blown in by the prevailing winds.\n\nAs at 7pm, the 24-hr PSI was still in the moderate range, and the 1-hr PM2.5 concentration readings were in the normal band and the lower end of the elevated band.\n\nDry weather in the region, including Sumatra and Kalimantan, meant that moderate to dense smoke haze continued to emanate from persistent hotspots. There were a total of 222 hotspots detected in Sumatra, while 1,264 were detected in Kalimantan on Thursday.\n\nWind directions and haze movement on September 12, 2019. NEA\n\nGiven the current situation, NEA said that the elderly, pregnant women and children should minimise prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, while those with chronic lung or heart disease should avoid prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion. People who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention.\n\nHealthy individuals should also reduce prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, it said.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - The haze seen from Novena in Singapore at 11am on September 12, 2019.
