He vigorously denies the accusations, saying that his sentencing was politically motivated. In late September, the 73-year-old rejected the offer of semi-open prison conditions and insisted that he would only leave his cell after being fully acquitted.\n\n\u201cEvery president, who won an election in Latin America, is expecting help from the US now. It\u2019s just unprecedented,\u201d Lula said in the extensive interview.\n\nIf the US were really helping Mexico [like they say] it would\u2019ve been Canada, not Mexico. The only assistance that the Americans are providing for Mexico is building the wall, which would prevent poor Mexicans and Latin Americans from making it to the US. The rich ones just fly above this wall on their planes anyway.\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t care about other nations and \u201chelp themselves, in the first place,\u201d the leftist icon pointed out. \u201cThe Americans already made a custom of occupying every country that proclaims its own sovereign interests.\u201d\n\nLula\u2019s political nemesis and Brazil\u2019s current president, Jair Bolsonaro, \u201ckeeps licking the American boots,\u201d he said. To Lula, this means he has \u201cno respect for himself and his country.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro speaks of Brazilian sovereignty, but at the same time sends his son [Eduardo Bolsonaro] to the US as an ambassador to give the Amazon to the Americans for further exploitation. That\u2019s definitely wrong.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Poop less, save the planet\u2019: Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro dismisses worries over Amazon deforestation\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the US and Brazil agreed to promote the private-sector development in the Amazon and established a special biodiversity conservation fund for this purpose. They claimed that opening the region for business was the only way to preserve the rainforests, which were recently hit by massive fires \u2013 but have faced man-made deforestation for years.\n\n\n\nLula believes that \u201cBrazil shouldn\u2019t depend on the US. Brazil should only count on its own intellectual resources: its own scientists, universities and hardworking people.\u201d\n\nOur internal market has 210 million consumers and the market of Latin America is 450 million. If we find common ground and establish closer ties, we\u2019ll be able to form a very powerful political bloc on the international level. The governments should understand that the only way forward for South and Latin America is having sovereignty in developing its own policies.\n\nThe former president of Brazil also blasted Washington for pushing for regime change in another Latin American nation, Venezuela.\n\n\u201cI object to any attempts of manipulating a sovereign state\u2026 when fake candidates like Guaido are being appointed,\u201d Lula said, referring to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who proclaimed himself an \u201cinterim president\u201d with the full backing and support from the US, to challenge the rule of Venezuela\u2019s democratically elected president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\u201cThe world shouldn\u2019t be a hostage to US policies; to the madness of Donald Trump, who thinks he can intervene in any country; kill any president,\u201d Lula added.\n\nAlso on rt.com Venezuela has become \u2018the best evil experiment\u2019 against multilateralism by US \u2013 Maduro\u2019s VP\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "Latin American countries must unite and pursue independent policies instead of trading their sovereignty for empty promises of US aid, former Brazilian president Lula da Silva told RT in an exclusive interview from jail.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d97b40b85f54039c0341094.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
