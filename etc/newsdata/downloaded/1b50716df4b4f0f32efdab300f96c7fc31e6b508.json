Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., hired a video creator -- but fired him just a day later -- after old politically incorrect comedy videos that were deemed offensive turned up on YouTube.\n\nThe staffer, Matt Orfalea, had apologized Monday for some of the videos, including one that supposedly sexualized Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\n\u201cWhen I was about 20 yrs old, I edited MLK audio, to expose how easily media can completely misrepresent reality. That intention has been clearly stated in the Youtube description for 10 years. It was supposed to be a \u2018reminder that media on tv or the web can be edited to twist facts/reality.\u2019 I am embarrassed to say it was also a pathetic attempt at comedy,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post. \u201cThere was a time when the vulgar ridiculousness of the final product made me laugh. Looking back at it now makes me ill. I choose not to delete it only because I want to be fully transparent. I\u2019m sincerely sorry I ever made it.\u201d\n\nBILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS\u2019 PLAN: ECONOMISTS\n\nSanders Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir responded: \u201cAll initial job offers are contingent on the completion of a final review of a person\u2019s record. That vetting process had not yet been completed. It\u2019s clear some of Matt\u2019s prior social media content does not reflect the campaign\u2019s values. We accept his resignation.\u201d\n\nOrfalea has had over 14,000 followers on Twitter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added in his statement: \u201cIn addition to being labeled \u2018racist\u2019, I am now also under scrutiny for using the words \u2018retarded\u2019 and \u2018gay\u2019 in old videos. It\u2019s not acceptable and I\u2019m sorry for it.\u201d\n\nHe concluded: \u201cDespite my thoughtless past use of the word \u2018retarded\u2019, I hold absolutely no prejudice toward anyone with special needs. In fact, I live happily with my adult special needs younger brother.\u201d\n\nFox News' Pat Ward contributed to this report.", "description": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Sen.
