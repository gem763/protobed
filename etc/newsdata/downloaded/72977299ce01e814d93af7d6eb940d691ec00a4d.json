So, nothing I\u2019ve seen surprises me at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had him marked as a player from the first time I saw him at St George\u2019s Park. Chelsea would be the same on that, I think.\n\n\u2018Of course he\u2019s now been able to have the opportunity to play in the Premier League and display that against top teams. I think you saw his penalty in the Super Cup, that was a nice cameo of what he\u2019s about, really.\u2019\n\nWhile Mount starts, Chelsea teammates Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori \u2013 as well as Ross Barkley \u2013 are likely to be on the bench in Prague, and Southgate is delighted to see young English players being given a chance at Chelsea.\n\nMount was also included in Southgate\u2019s previous England squad (Picture: Getty)\n\nHe continued: \u2018I think I\u2019ve spoken for a couple of years now about the quality of young players coming through our academies. Chelsea have been at the forefront of that, winning the Uefa Youth League and FA Youth Cup consistently.\n\n\u2018So it\u2019s a shame, maybe, one or two of their youngsters didn\u2019t get that opportunity and have had to go and play elsewhere and might have missed that moment that has been perfect for the likes of Tammy and Mason.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great timing for them because they\u2019ve had those loan spells and they were probably ready to take that opportunity. So, as a young player, you\u2019ve got ability, you\u2019ve got the work you do but, in the end, you need the opportunity.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Gareth Southgate says Mason Mount has impressed him ever since he saw the midfielder playing for the Under-16s as he prepares to hand the Chelsea youngster his first start for...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173373306_1570744953.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
