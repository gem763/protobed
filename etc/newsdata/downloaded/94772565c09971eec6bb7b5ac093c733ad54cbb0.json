Local leaders have called for a probe of the department, and Jefferson\u2019s family and their attorney want an independent review of Jefferson\u2019s killing, saying they worry race may have played a role.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice identified the officer who killed Jefferson as Aaron Dean and said he had been with the Fort Worth Police Department since April 2018. Had he not resigned on his own, he would have been fired for violations of the department\u2019s policies on use of force, de-escalation and unprofessional conduct in connection with the shooting, Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus said at a news conference.\n\nThe officer \u201cstill faces criminal charges\u201d pending an investigation, Kraus said. The department has also asked the FBI to review Dean\u2019s actions for possible civil rights violations, according to the chief.\n\n\u201cNone of this information can ease the pain of Atatiana\u2019s family, but I hope it shows the community that we take these incidents seriously,\u201d Kraus said. He apologized to the family on behalf of the department, saying he has \u201cnot been able to make sense of why she had to lose her life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is not clear whether Dean has an attorney.\n\nThe swift condemnation of the shooting reflects efforts by city officials to ease tensions between police and black residents, which flared around the recent trial of Amber Guyger, a white former officer who fatally shot her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, in 2018.\n\nEarlier this month, a Dallas jury convicted Guyger of murder and sentenced her to 10 years in prison. The details of the shooting bore some parallels to the shooting of Jefferson: Both victims were young, black and in their homes when they were killed by police. Jean, 26, was sitting on his couch in his apartment eating ice cream when Guyger entered and opened fire, apparently believing it was her own unit.\n\nAD\n\nDays after Guyger\u2019s sentencing, Joshua Brown, a key witness in the case, was fatally shot, stoking rumors that he was targeted because of his testimony. Police attributed Brown\u2019s death to a drug deal gone awry and emphatically denied a connection to the Guyger case, but that has not quelled concerns among some local officials and activists, who have called for an independent investigation, as The Washington Post has reported.\n\nAD\n\nJefferson was a graduate of Xavier University who worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales, her family said. She had recently moved into the house in Fort Worth\u2019s Hillside Morningside neighborhood to help care for her mother, who was in poor health.\n\n\u201cShe was a smart, ambitious, kind person with a nurturing spirit,\u201d Jefferson\u2019s older sister, Ashley, said during a Monday news conference. \u201cAny parent would be proud to call her daughter.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe demand justice,\u201d she said, \u201cthrough an independent, thorough and transparent process.\u201d\n\nOfficers were dispatched to Jefferson\u2019s home around 2:25 a.m. Saturday after receiving an \u201copen structure\u201d call, according to police. A neighbor dialed a non-emergency line to request a welfare check because he noticed the door was ajar and the lights were on, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.\n\nAD\n\nWhile searching the outside of the house, police said, an officer saw someone standing near a window, and, \u201cperceiving a threat, the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside the residence.\u201d\n\nJefferson was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nAD\n\nLee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney representing Jefferson\u2019s family, said Jefferson was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew Saturday when she thought she heard a prowler outside the house. When she went to the bedroom window to see what was going on, he said, the officer opened fire.\n\nOn Monday, Merritt demanded an outside agency investigate the officer and the department\u2019s practices. He said he believed the fact that Jefferson lived in a predominantly black neighborhood led officers to respond to the call more aggressively than they might have otherwise.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a pattern for that department, and it seems common when dealing with people of African American descent,\" Merritt said.\n\nAD\n\nA 2-minute body-camera video released by police showed the moments leading up to the shooting of Jefferson. In the footage, two officers could be seen walking quietly around the side of the house and peering through screen doors, then moving down a driveway into a backyard.\n\nOne officer approached a closed first-floor window and shined a flashlight inside, then quickly raised his gun.\n\n\u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d he yelled. A moment later, he fired through the window. He did not identify himself as an officer in the footage.\n\nAlong with the body-camera video, police released images of a firearm officers said they found at the scene.\n\nBut Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price told people to disregard the weapon. \u201cThe gun is irrelevant,\u201d she said in Monday\u2019s news conference. \u201cShe was in her own home caring for an 8-year-old nephew.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrice acknowledged that the shooting of Jefferson had contributed to a breakdown in trust between the community and police. She said the city had taken steps to bring in a panel of third-party national experts to review the department\u2019s policies and training practices. The city is also preparing to interview candidates for an independent police monitor position that was recently approved by the city council, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe are all heartbroken today. Atatiana was a beautiful, smart, amazing young woman, by all accounts, who was unjustly taken from her family,\u201d Price added. \u201cThere is nothing that could justify what happened Saturday morning.\u201d\n\nPrice also apologized to James Smith, the neighbor who called police to Jefferson\u2019s home for a welfare check. \u201cI know you\u2019re hurting today as well,\u201d Price said. \u201cYou were being that wonderful neighbor, the one that we would all want next door to us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice said they will turn over body-camera footage and other relevant evidence to the Tarrant County district attorney\u2019s office, which will decide whether to prosecute.\n\nJefferson is one of at least 709 people in the country who have been killed by police officers in 2019, according to a Post database that tracks such shootings. Of those, fewer than three dozen were women, five of whom were black.\n\nRead more:", "description": "The officer, who is white, shot Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, through her window after \"perceiving a threat,\" police said.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8pBCRZBEBtobRVIQ4J4QZd6Ih8o=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-14-2019/t_40b6f891601f4508a7669b1d1d9b2648_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_09_20_Still014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
