Trump trade envoy Peter Navarro appealed \u201cpersonally\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s opening day of the emergency meeting for countries to support Washington\u2019s reform push.\n\nThe UPU\u2019s \u201cextraordinary congress\u201d is only the third since the 192-member intergovernmental body was created in 1874 to smooth international mail deliveries.\n\nThe Trump administration insists that some postal carriers, such as China\u2019s, aren\u2019t paying enough to have foreign shipments delivered to U.S. recipients and argues the current international mail system is ill-suited for the 21st-century boom in shipping because of e-commerce.\n\n\u201cThe mission here today is to retool this system for the brave new world of e-commerce,\u201d Navarro said in brief remarks to delegates. \u201cAs we say in America, \u2018You know what to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe complaint centers on the reimbursement that the U.S. Postal Service receives for providing final deliveries of bulky letters and small parcels sent from abroad, usually ones not weighing more than 2 kilograms (about 4\u00bd pounds). Such mail can often include mobile phones, memory sticks or pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe 144 UPU members on hand rejected - in a 78-57 vote, with nine abstentions - a plan that Navarro called the preferred U.S. option. That would have immediately set up \u201cself-declared rates\u201d for reimbursement.\n\nAnother proposal, a phased approach to such self-declared rates, comes up Wednesday and is the only possible outcome that the United States would support at the meeting. A rejection could drive the Trump administration to quit the union as threatened on Oct. 17.\n\nUPU Secretary General Bishar Hussein of Kenya said he was \u201cvery optimistic\u201d a deal could be reached. He said he hoped the United States wouldn\u2019t leave, warning that it would be forced to strike bilateral deals with other UPU countries - and huge mail backlogs could be the outcome.\n\n\u201cIf United States leaves, you will get those piles (of mail) you are talking about for sure, because somehow every country has to figure out how to send mail to the United States - \u2018cause the traditional system will completely shut down,\u201d Hussein said in response to a reporter\u2019s question at a news conference.\n\nNavarro\u2019s participation has added a political heavyweight to the gathering, which mostly involves civil servants.\n\nHe said under the existing system, the United States is forced to \u201cheavily subsidize\u201d the importation of small parcels \u201cin a way that costs our Postal Service hundreds of millions of dollars a year and costs our economy tens of thousands of jobs.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cno reasonable person\u201d could support the existing reimbursement system.\n\nNavarro also referenced his White House responsibilities, saying he\u2019s been involved in trade negotiations with a half-dozen Western countries and helped to promote the defense of another half dozen.\n\n\u201cFrom this broader perspective, I am personally asking you to support the United States position,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIn times like these, where no reasonable person could support the terminal dues system, this is what friends and allies do for each other.\u201d\n\nA Chinese representative said her country opposed the option backed by the United States that was defeated Tuesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In a showdown Tuesday at a Universal Postal Union meeting, countries rejected the Trump administration's favored approach to an international mail problem that is making the U.S. consider leaving the 145-year-old body.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jamey Keaten"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/switzerland_us_postal_problems_52609_c0-187-5472-3377_s1770x1032.jpg?4f85702a28876af8b9475e76a391879503767678", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
