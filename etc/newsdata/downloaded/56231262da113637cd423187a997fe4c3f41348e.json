The city would construct a new facility in every borough except Staten Island.\n\n\u201cThis is among the most consequential applications to come before the City Planning Commission in years,\u201d said commission Chair Marisa Lago during a public meeting Tuesday. \u201cToday\u2019s vote is so much more than a vote on site selections and special permits. It\u2019s a vote to end a bleak era in New York City\u2019s criminal justice history and a step towards critical criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nHer remarks and the subsequent proceedings were continually interrupted by chants from members of the group No New Jails, which has been advocating against the closure plan.\n\nThe group argues the development of the new jails comes with no guarantee that Rikers will actually close, and that the funds required for the plan \u2014 currently estimated at $8.7 billion \u2014 should not be spent on perpetuating a system they consider inherently racist and violent.\n\nSeveral commissioners who cast votes in approval said they remain concerned about aspects of the project, but feel the need to close the notoriously violent jail complex is too great to shoot the proposal down at this point.\n\n\u201cThe site in the Bronx troubles me,\u201d said Commissioner Allen Cappelli, echoing the opposition of Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and other elected officials from the borough who have repeatedly called on the city to select a different site for the Bronx facility. Still, Cappelli continued, \u201cthe overwhelming issue for me is closing Rikers Island.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Diaz called the commission\u2019s vote \u201cunfortunate\u201d and said the administration \u201chas weaponized the land use process against The Bronx in order to protect their plans.\u201d\n\nCommissioners Orlando Mar\u00edn, Raj Rampershad and Fred Cerullo \u2014 appointed to the body by the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island borough presidents, respectively \u2014 voted against the proposal.\n\nWhile the local Council members who will ultimately need to green-light the proposal have been generally supportive of the closure plan, the range of continued opposition remains a hurdle to its final approval. The fight is shaping up to have implications in future races for local elected office, such as the special election for borough president taking shape in Queens, in anticipation of Melinda Katz potentially leaving the position to serve as district attorney.\n\nIn recommendations submitted earlier in the review process, the borough presidents and local community boards who weighed in raised concerns about the size of the proposed facilities and called for reductions.\n\nOfficials have modified the plans since earlier this year to reflect smaller facilities, following a lower estimate of the city\u2019s eventual jail population in light of recent changes to the state's criminal justice system. The current population of Rikers hovers around 7,290 people, and officials estimate it will fall to 4,000 people by 2026.\n\nNevertheless, some community groups remain steadfastly opposed to the proposal.\n\n\u201cA number of the commissioners expressed serious reservations and concerns about this flawed application, from the use of design/build, to the site selection to the size, yet they chose to approve the plan, as is,\u201d the Chinatown-based group Neighbors United Below Canal said in a statement on the commission vote. \u201cThis is NOT city planning but a rubber stamp.\u201d\n\nCriminal justice activists with the #CLOSErikers campaign, which has pushed for the effort, praised the commission\u2019s decision. The group, however, is still calling for an accelerated closure plan and further reductions in the jail population than what the city is planning.\n\nSome members of the group criticized the more vocal No New Jails activists on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on Rikers Island; a lot of these individuals that are saying \u2018no new jails,\u2019 they haven\u2019t even been on a visit,\u201d said Harvey Murphy, a Mott Haven resident who said he's served time at the complex. \u201cI understand that in order to close Rikers we have to have something else.\u201d\n\nThe proposal will come up for a City Council hearing on Sept. 5.", "description": "The plan calls for shuttering the troubled jail complex in the next seven years and developing smaller facilities to house the city\u2019s jail population.", "authors": ["Janaki Chadha"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/18/35/0e2a02d04807a16d7fea70ba3899/rikers-ap-900.jpg"}
