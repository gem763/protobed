Our showcased products demonstrate our commitment to creating the industry\u2019s most cost-effective, robust wheel solutions \u2013 for today and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTough and Light North American Commercial Vehicle Steel Wheel\n\nWeighing in at 64 lbs., Maxion Wheels\u2019 newest truck wheel for North America is the \u201ctoughest and lightest\u201d standard 22.5\u00d78.25 commercial vehicle steel wheel in the market. Available in 2020, the new wheel weighs less than its predecessor \u2013 yet is stronger as a result of optimized design, engineering and flow forming technologies.\n\nWith a 7,400 lb. wheel load rating, Tough and Light features a new circular hand hole shape deviating from the traditional Maxion Wheels\u2019 D-shape. Changing the hand hole combined with design optimization analysis reduced wheel structural stresses by more than 10% resulting in an even more efficient and durable wheel when compared to the previous generation.\n\n\u201cMaxion Wheels\u2019 commitment to leading the commercial vehicle market with cost-competitive lightweight wheels is a key force behind our latest weight reduction breakthrough,\u201d added Polk. \u201cImproved fuel efficiency and fewer emissions are just two benefits that come from the lighter wheel. Multiply that by 18 and you have a serious top-line payload opportunity and a bottom-line cost benefit.\u201d\n\nSmart Wheel Connectivity Solution\n\nMaxion Wheels is partnering with ZF OPENMATICS to help fleets perform more safely and efficiently by collecting essential vehicle data at the wheel through its groundbreaking MaxSmart\u00ae technology. Maxion Wheels\u2019 wheel sensor technology is paired with ZF OPENMATICS\u2019 intelligent sensing and telematics expertise to offer the industry\u2019s first Smart Wheel Connectivity Solution, a fully-integrated mechanical and sensing solution to help prevent potentially dangerous and costly tire and wheel-end failures.\n\nMounted directly to the truck wheel rim, the durable Bluetooth tag tracks vehicle load, tire humidity, temperature, and air pressure, as well as wheel position, speed and vibration across nine axis. Information is collected in real time and wirelessly transmitted to the vehicle\u2019s telematics onboard unit before being transferred to the ZF Cloud.\n\nInitially, targeting the commercial vehicle market, the multiservice sensor will undergo feasibility studies during the first half of 2020, followed by real-world testing and validation.\n\nLast Mile Delivery Light Commercial Vehicle Steel Wheel\n\nThe very basis of how goods are transported in the future will change with a significant number of Class 3 \u2013 7, light- and medium-duty vehicles now serving the last mile of delivery. Understanding how these vehicles, many switching to electric powertrains, need to perform led Maxion Wheels to develop the Last Mile Delivery wheel \u2013 a steel wheel repurposed for new mobility urban transport vehicles. By utilizing a proven concept, Maxion Wheels\u2019 customers are countering the rising costs of new technologies and electric powertrains with a cost-effective, validated solution.\n\nAEROWHEEL Commercial Vehicle Concept Wheel Cover\n\nAlso showcased during the press conference was Maxion Wheels\u2019 drag-reducing, patent-pending aerodynamic concept wheel cover for the steer axle, AEROWHEEL. The company\u2019s understanding of vehicle aerodynamics and the role a wheel plays in generating turbulence is the inspiration for this functional and stylish wheel design concept for trucks and buses. Using computational fluid dynamics, the cover proved to significantly reduce drag thereby improving fuel efficiency.\n\nABOUT MAXION WHEELS\n\nMaxion Wheels, a division of IOCHPE-MAXION S.A., is a leading wheel manufacturer for passenger cars, light trucks, buses, commercial trucks and trailers.
