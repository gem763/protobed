A study by a truck industry group says drivers faced longer waits and more frequent delays at loading docks in 2018 than they did under an earlier study. The WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith writes the uptick the American Transportation Research Institute analysis found came during the busiest year in freight trucking demand in recent memory, with companies scrambling to keep goods moving during a sharp upturn in the U.S. economy. ATRI\u2019s Dan Murray says the message from drivers was that the pleas for trucks didn\u2019t lead to \u201cmore docks, more staff, more flexible hours\u201d to pick up or drop off shipments. Supply-chain consultant Lee Clair says the results suggest that most shipping customers still struggle to make their operations trucker-friendly, even as delays bring inefficiencies and higher costs to distribution.\n\nECONOMY & TRADE\n\nThe escalating dispute souring relations between Japan and South Korea could reach the maritime industry. Officials in Seoul are getting concerned that Tokyo may derail plans to merge South Korea\u2019s two big shipyards, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Costas Paris writes. The conflict over Japan\u2019s use of forced labor in World War II hasn\u2019t drawn the attention of the U.S.-China trade war, but it\u2019s already buffeting supply chains and raising alarms for the way a diplomatic impasse has threatened to sever important trade ties. The tensions are growing as Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co. prepares to seek antitrust approvals from several countries for its planned tie-up with Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co. The combination would create a shipbuilding behemoth to compete with yards in China and Japan. But the fate of the deal may rest on issues far outside shipping.\n\nA growing tug-of-war over tariffs is underway between suppliers and retailers. Target Corp. \u2019s recent directive to suppliers to absorb the costs of new levies highlights the financial strains that are stretching from factories to store shelves. The WSJ\u2019s William Mauldin and Sarah Nassauer report that Target and other store chains have warned the U.S. government that consumers would be on the hook for the new tariffs on imports from China, with higher prices at checkout. But Target sent a letter to suppliers late last month saying it \u201cwill not accept any new cost increases\u201d related to the levies that started taking effect Sept. 1. The battle reflects retailers\u2019 reluctance to pass along the higher costs to consumers by raising prices, a line that is getting harder to hold as new levies hit consumer products that were exempted from earlier volleys in the trade war.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201c If they say no, it could all come crumbling down. \u201d \u2014A Korean maritime executive, on Japan\u2019s potential consideration of the Korean shipyard merger.\n\nNumber of the Day 10,900 North American Class 8 truck orders in August, according to ACT Research, a 79% decline from a year ago but nearly 6% ahead of July orders.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nFreight-matching startup Loadsmart Inc. raised $19 million from a Maersk venture-capital arm and Ports America to back a digital service for port trucking.
