We\u2019re continually collecting data, teaching the algorithm to get smarter,\u201d Trollope added.\n\nThe drones featured at the World of Drones Congress in Brisbane on Thursday, where images were beamed in from a demonstration at a Queensland crocodile park.\n\nDrone sponsor Westpac Bank, which has also sponsored drones that can both spot sharks and drop rescue devices to people in trouble since 2016, has sponsored rescue service helicopters for more than 40 years.\n\nQueensland government data from January 2018 shows that four of 11 crocodile attacks since 2011 were fatal, including one in 2017 in the northern holiday area of Port Douglas.", "description": "An Australian maker of drones used to spot sharks near surf beaches has partnered with online retailer Amazon.com Inc and other firms to create a drone service that could protect tourists from crocodiles in holiday destinations.", "authors": ["Hans Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
