The fell 0.52%, or 142.70 points, the traded down 0.31%, or 9.43 points, and the slipped 0.28%, or 23.17 points, after a drone strike on Saudi Arabia's oil industry knocked out 5.7 million barrels of crude production out of Aramco facilities. That equates to about 50% of the kingdom's oil output. The \"Mad Money\" host argued that a lot of stocks on Wall Street can perform better with higher oil prices and others that can do well if those prices cause the economy to slow. That helped prevent the market from seeing even more carnage during the session. \"I know this stock market's resilience could melt if the White House decides to make an all-out strike against Tehran,\" Cramer said. \"But, man ... it's amazing how the averages pretty much shrugged off such a major [oil production] decline, something that would've been totally impossible to even think about a decade ago, and that's worth keeping in mind.\"\n\nTools Wall Street experts use to value cloud stocks\n\nCaiaimage/Agnieszka Olek | Getty Images\n\nCramer revealed \"quick and dirty\" tricks that investors can use to assess enterprise software stocks like a Wall Street expert. High-flying cloud equities have taken double-digit hits in recent weeks due to the rotation from secular to cyclical investments. Because of this, the host warned it's time to be \"more selective.\" \"When you make these kinds of decisions, you need to be ruthlessly logical, not emotional ... We're in triage mode, and that means we need to be as objective as possible,\" he said. \"We're going to run our whole cloud universe through these two filters \u2014 one is for fundamentals, one is for valuation. Anything that passes both filters, well then you've got my blessing buy down here after the big sell-off.\"\n\nBe careful buying Cloudflare\n\nalengo | iStock 360 | Getty Images\n\nShares of web security company Cloudflare are up more than 20% from its $15 IPO, closing at $18.63 on Monday. Cramer, however, is skeptical. \"Based on Cloudflare's inconsistent results over the past eighteen months, the stock's just too risky for me, especially in a market that no longer worships at the altar of the cloud,\" he said.\n\nBringing cryptocurrency to gold\n\nChad Cascarilla, CEO of Paxos. Adam Jeffery | CNBC\n\nThe digital age is reaching all corners of business, and one New York start-up is offering a secured way to gain exposure to gold by tethering the yellow metal to cryptocurrency. Paxos, a privately held financial institution that provides a way to move between physical and digital assets, has launched a tokenized version of the precious metal called PAX Gold. CEO Charles Cascarilla, who co-founded the firm in 2012, told CNBC that Paxos is a safe platform for both individual and institutional investors to buy the commodity. \"We're really a technology firm at heart, and so we're trying to give you the confidence of a bank, but the innovation of Silicon Valley,\" he said in a sitdown with Cramer. \"And that's just different from, I think, most institutions that are in the banking world today.\"\n\nGauging Saudi Aramco's IPO\n\nAn Aramco oil tank is seen at the Production facility at Saudi Aramco's Shaybah oilfield in the Empty Quarter, Saudi Arabia.
