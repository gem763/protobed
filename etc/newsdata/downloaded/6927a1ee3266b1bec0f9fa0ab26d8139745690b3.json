(Ministry of Transportation. )\n\nCasselman Mayor Daniel Lafleur said he is already confident the higher limit will make the road less safe.\n\nHe said people already speed and with the higher limit they will only speed more.\n\n\"If we say 100 km/h, people are going 120 on the 417, so people will [now] be going 130,\" Lafleur said.\n\n\"We are going to have more deaths on our roads and I have a hard time with that.\"\n\nMayors of The Nation, Champlain, and Russell said they were not concerned about the increase.\n\n2 pilots in SW Ontario\n\nThe other areas where speed limits are being increased are a section between St. Catharines and Hamilton and a section between Sarnia and London.\n\nThe government is promising more signs and other safety measures to ensure drivers are aware of the speed change. The rules around stunt driving will still apply at 150 km/h.\n\nThe government is also accepting feedback on the pilot projects online for the next two months.\n\nSix other Canadian provinces allow for speed limits over 100 km/h.", "description": "Drivers looking to drive with a little more lead in their foot are now able to legally rev their engines harder between the Quebec border and east Ottawa.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4782598.1534097836!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/highway-417-queensway-sign-ottawa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
