It was a brief meeting of the Redskins\u2019 future and past \u2014 both first-round quarterbacks taken with the hope they would resurrect the franchise.\n\nGriffin hugged Haskins, patted him on his shoulder pads and told him to stay focused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be a ball player,\u201d said Griffin, who is now a backup in Baltimore. \u201cI see it in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means a lot for me hearing that from him,\u201d Haskins said later.\n\nUnlike Griffin, a starter from Day 1, Haskins will have to wait before he ultimately gets his turn to lead the Redskins. With the preseason done, the 22-year-old must learn behind veteran Case Keenum as Washington shifts to its Week 1 game against the Philadelphia Eagles. It\u2019s a situation Haskins has been in before \u2014 he sat for two years at Ohio State \u2014 but one difficult to navigate nonetheless.\n\nThe Redskins understand fans will call for Haskins to take over if Keenum struggles at any point in the regular season. Coach Jay Gruden, too, acknowledged Keenum must perform to keep his job. How long will it be until a change is made?\n\nStanding against a wall inside the Redskins\u2019 locker room, Haskins said he is going to still prepare as if he\u2019s the starting quarterback.\n\nThat\u2019s just how he operates, he said.\n\n\u201cI know I can play,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cThe biggest thing is (to) keep progressing as far as getting to the line of scrimmage, calling the play fast and calling it right and precise and make sure the guys hear me, have great body language on and off the field. \u2026 Just keep building.\u201d\n\nIn his first \u2014 and only \u2014 start of the preseason, Haskins built upon his previous performances. The quarterback played with a certain confidence, and admitted that knowing he\u2019d be the starter for this week helped put him at ease. Haskins knew he could have fun and be a leader.\n\nAt his best, Haskins is a passer who can stand tall and dissect from the pocket \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what he did against the Ravens. In the first quarter, Haskins and the Redskins marched down the field as Haskins completed four straight attempts that ended in a 7-yard touchdown strike to Steven Sims.\n\nThe drive was particularly impressive for a few reasons. First, Haskins found his rhythm and was effective. Further, Haskins\u2018 strength increasingly appears to be recognizing defenses \u2014 such as when he noticed a free blitzing defender, remained calm and delivered a perfect throw to tight end J.P. Holtz for a 24-yard gain. Repeatedly, Haskins\u2018 coaches praise him for his composure, and it does seem like the quarterback hardly gets rattled.\n\nOverall, Haskins finished with 104 yards, completing 58 percent (10 of 17) of his passes. He had a 96.2 quarterback rating.\n\n\u201cHe was good, had good energy,\u201d said Gruden, who pulled Haskins after the first half. \u201cCommunicated the offense well to others, made some nice plays. \u2026 I have to check out the film, but I am happy for him the way he played today.\u201d\n\nGruden now wants Haskins to build on his performance. Even without the quarterback possibly seeing game action anytime soon, Gruden stressed Haskins must learn every game plan and every wrinkle added to the team\u2019s playbook throughout the season. Haskins may not receive as many reps, but he can still prepare.\n\nHaskins said he wasn\u2019t surprised when he learned Keenum was going to be Washington\u2019s starting quarterback. After all, the rookie rarely received first-team reps \u2014 especially as the summer progressed. Gruden\u2019s announcement Sunday was just a formality.\n\nDespite Haskins not winning the job, the Redskins are still high on their rookie. On draft night, Gruden said Haskins would need to be developed \u2014 and they\u2019ve been pleased with how he has progressed in that regard.\n\nHaskins seems to be embracing his journey.\n\n\u201cI may not be the starter right now,\u201d Haskins said, \u201cbut I may be one day.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
