It was launched in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nThe liberal news site is expected to be folded into CAP's online presence and focus on analysis from CAP scholars and CAP Action staff.\n\nClimateProgress, which merged with ThinkProgress almost a decade ago, will be taken over by its founder Joe Romm.\n\nNayak said that CAP could not \"continue supplementing the growing shortfall in ThinkProgress revenue.\"\n\nHe added that despite conversations with more than 20 potential publishers for ThinkProgress, CAP ultimately was unable to find a publisher for the site.\n\nA CAP aide told The Daily Beast that a dozen ThinkProgress employees will lose their jobs. Laid off employees will reportedly receive severance through the end of November and health care coverage through the end of the year.\n\n\"ThinkProgress and the hundreds of journalists who have worked there over the past decade, many having become leaders in their field, leave behind a deep and unique legacy of helping the country move toward truth, justice, and progress,\" Nayak said.\n\nFormer staffers expressed sadness and anger over the closure on social media.\n\n\"It's disheartening that CAP no longer believes that independent progressive journalism is worth supporting,\" wrote ThinkProgress founder Judd Legum, who left the site last year, in a Twitter thread.\n\n\"ThinkProgress started before the HuffingtonPost, before the DailyBeast, before Twitter, before Facebook,\" he added. \"And it had a big impact.\"\n\n2. I joined CAP in 2003 and was one of the first employees and I joined because I believed in the mission of creating permanent progressive infrastructure\n\n\n\nIt's disheartening that CAP no longer believes that independent progressive journalism is worth supporting \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 6, 2019\n\n3. (Quick note to trolls: Sorry, but I didn't lose my job. I left ThinkProgress over a year ago.)\n\n\n\nThinkProgress started before the HuffingtonPost, before the DailyBeast, before Twitter, before Facebook\n\n\n\nAnd it had a big impact \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 6, 2019\n\n4. The decision to fold ThinkProgress back into CAP, in my view, is a mistake. It violates the spirit in which it has operated over the last 15 years.\n\n\n\nIt also underscores that this was ultimately about control, not money. \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 6, 2019\n\nHuffPost Washington bureau chief Amanda Terkel tweeted that the closure was \"so stupid all around.\"\n\nShe added that progressive media outlets need support, including \"linking to them, sharing their stories, giving them scoops and like\u2026 helping them thrive for real.\"\n\nThe fact that TP is dying is so stupid all around. \u2014 Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) September 6, 2019\n\nThat means supporting them financially, linking to them, sharing their stories, giving them scoops and like\u2026 helping them thrive for real. \u2014 Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) September 6, 2019\n\n\"The death of @thinkprogress makes me so, so sad on a personal level. @fshakir gave me my first full-time job as a critic, and the resources I needed to be in the room at places like @OfficialTCA,\" wrote Washington Post opinion writer Alyssa Rosenberg, referring to Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump digs in on Hurricane Dorian projection Block the misuse of facial recognition, not the tech itself The Hill's Campaign Report: North Carolina special election poses test for GOP ahead of 2020 MORE' campaign manager Faiz Shakir and the Television Critics Association.\n\nThe death of @thinkprogress makes me so, so sad on a personal level. @fshakir gave me my first full-time job as a critic, and the resources I needed to be in the room at places like @OfficialTCA.
