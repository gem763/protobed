Sophie Penney rounds up the weekend's action.\n\nChelsea\u2019s Hayes singing as they topple champions Arsenal\n\nChelsea 2 Arsenal 1\n\nChelsea have never had more fans come and watch them at home for a domestic game, bar their stint at Stamford Bridge. And it felt full. What a game for it as Chelsea ended Arsenal\u2019s perfect start to the WSL season with a 2-1 win, secured in the last five minutes of normal time by the Norwegian Maria Thorisdottir\u2019s 25 yarder.\n\nThe 4,149 fans were all offered a songbook on arrival, full of chants that they belted out throughout the game.\n\nTheir manager Emma Hayes had a sing along herself just 20 minutes before kick off, practicing behind the scenes. In the hilarious video posted on Twitter (see below) she seems to be getting quite into her rendition of \u201cGurooo, she comes from the fjords, Gurooo, she assists and scores\u2026\u201d, adding her own original hand gestures. Next up a bit of Abba with \u201cDeanna Cooper, skills are gonna blind me, shining like the sun\u2026\u201d to the tune of \u201cSuper Trooper\u201d, Hayes adding the oom-pa-pa\u2019s. She\u2019s quick to correct her Chelsea colleague who calls her the number one: \u201cno, 21!\u201d.", "description": "Manchester City are top of the Women's Super League four games into the season after Chelsea put an end to Arsenal's perfect start.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Keith Hackett", "Alan Tyers", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000212906449-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6844extr6dIv-d8O8PIpPqbshHooRpJk-anXnRBzWKY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
