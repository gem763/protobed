She'll be sentenced Friday. The charge carries a potential sentence of up to one year in prison, but as a first-time offender, she could get probation.She was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs after Warren County Judge Donald Oda II revoked her bond. Richardson didn't respond when reporters later asked her if she had anything to say.The case divided people in her hometown of Carlisle, with Facebook pages devoted to it and some critics trying to record the Richardson family's comings and goings for social media. Prosecutors contended that the high school cheerleader wanted to keep her \"perfect life\" that included plans to begin classes at the University of Cincinnati. They said she hid her unwanted pregnancy and buried her baby in her family's backyard in May 2017, just after her senior prom.Her defense said the baby she named \"Annabelle\" was stillborn and that the teen was sad and scared.The remains were found about two months after she gave birth, buried in the backyard of her home where she lived with her parents in Carlisle, a village about 40 miles north of Cincinnati.A forensic pathologist who testified for the prosecution concluded the baby died from \"homicidal violence.\" Prosecutors said Richardson had searched on the internet for \"how to get rid of a baby.\" They played video for the jury of a police interview in which Richardson said the baby might have moved and made noises.Cincinnati psychologist Stuart Bassman said \"Skylar was being manipulated\" into making false statements during interrogations. He described Richardson as a vulnerable, immature person whose dependent personality disorder makes her want to please authority figures, even to the point of making incriminating statements that were untrue.Julie Kraft, an assistant prosecutor, suggested that besides wanting to please authorities, Richardson's desire to please her family and boyfriend and fear of them abandoning her could have motivated her to commit extreme acts.Her attorneys had had twice asked to move the trial that drew daily coverage from Court TV, citing intense publicity they said was fueled by the prosecution. But the judge denied their motions.", "description": "Jurors have acquitted a young Ohio mother of charges that she killed and buried her newborn.", "authors": ["Wlwt Digital Staff", "Https", "Www.Facebook.Com"], "top_image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/skylar-verdict-1568320178.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
