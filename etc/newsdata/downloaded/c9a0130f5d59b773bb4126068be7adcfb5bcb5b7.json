But there were also enough freebie errors coming his way to keep the comeback train on its tracks.\n\nMurray converted his first match point with a signature play, using a couple of neatly-judged lobs to make the increasingly nervy Coppejans play difficult overheads. \u201cI would have liked to have served a bit better,\u201d he said afterwards, \u201cbut I think I did well.\u201d", "description": "Andy Murray scored his first ATP singles victory on European soil for 16 months on Tuesday night:", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213128937-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqGw_8_YqFn6oOhW46YSWn9SnJ5Axt_dPFfgBF_QqPcg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
