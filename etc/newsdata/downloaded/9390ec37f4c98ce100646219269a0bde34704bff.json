Kelley, 26, had just walked out of the First Baptist Church where he fatally shot 26 people with an assault-style Ruger AR-556 semiautomatic rifle.\n\nFor either open carry or concealed carry permits, residents can apply to the Texas Department of Public Safety for a License to Carry a Handgun.\n\nThey must be at least 21 years old unless active duty military, meet federal qualifications to buy a gun, pass a background check, receive training, pay required fees and submit an application and other forms.\n\nApplicants must take four to six hours of classroom or online instruction, and one to two hours of training at a shooting range to demonstrate proficiency before a certified Texas firearms instructor.\n\nThe initial license is valid for four years, and its renewal, good for five years, does not require continuing education. The Department of Public Safety now issues the License to Carry instead of the Concealed Handgun License.\n\nUnder Texas law, a holder of a concealed carry permit also can open carry but must submit a change of address to obtain a license to carry.\n\nSitting behind his desk at the association\u2019s fortress-like headquarters in central Dallas, Hopkins touched on how a \"good guy with a gun\" might endanger himself, gun restrictions and how law enforcement officers have become targets.\n\nThe latest twist on the lone hero who saves the day sprang from a sound bite. It has ricocheted around since shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting Dec. 14, 2012.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun,\u201d Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president and chief executive officer, said at a news conference.\n\nA week before, Adam Lanza, 20, fatally shot his mother in her bed with a .22 caliber Savage Mark II bolt-action rifle. He left the gun on the floor near the bed after shooting her in the head four times.\n\nThen he drove to the school and killed 20 children and six adults with a semiautomatic Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle. The slaughter took less than 11 minutes with the AR-15 style weapon. His final act was to kill himself with a Glock 20 semiautomatic pistol. His mother had legally bought all of the guns.\n\nNow ingrained in the psyche of gun enthusiasts, LaPierre\u2019s famous statement adorns adult T-shirts, 100% cotton baby onesies and coffee mugs. Gun rights activists have often cited it.\n\nWhat does a 'good guy with a gun' look like?\n\nA good guy with a gun should mean something good, Hopkins said.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement is still troubled because when we show up on the scene, we don\u2019t exactly know who the good guy is, right?\u201d he said. \u201cBut things can happen very fast when people have guns out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may possibly shoot the good guy because, again, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nPolice officers don\u2019t want anybody else to be armed on the scene, he said.\n\n\u201cThe ability to carry a gun and then operate in some of these spaces, it\u2019s tough for law enforcement \u2013 and now you interject a civilian,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nCharley Wilkison, executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas, pointed to Sutherland Springs as a true example of a good guy with a gun.\n\n\u201cNo one questions whether or not that gentleman saved lives and was able to end that attack faster,\u201d Wilkison said.\n\nOutside the church that day, Willeford, 57, took cover behind a pickup and exchanged gunfire with the shooter, hitting him in the leg and torso. At the outset of the gunbattle, the gunman dropped his rifle. He returned fire with a semiautomatic pistol and fled in his SUV.\n\nWilleford enlisted a nearby pickup driver to give chase. A few minutes later, the church shooter lost control of the SUV and drove off the road. He was found dead in the vehicle with wounds including a self-inflicted gunshot. Police found two semiautomatic pistols in the vehicle, a Glock 19 and a Ruger SR22.\n\nStephen Willeford:The man who took down the Texas church gunman\n\nWilkison thinks it takes more than strapping on a firearm to qualify as a \"good guy.\"\n\n\u201cHopefully, it\u2019s someone who\u2019s well intended and ... adequately trained so that there\u2019s not an unintended consequence to operating a weapon,\u201d he said.\n\nThis civilian \"good guy\" also should be mentally fit and have clear ownership to the weapon, Wilkison said.\n\n\u201cUltimately, a 'good guy with a gun' is going to be a law enforcement professional that arrives and is able to holistically handle the situation,\" he said.\n\nHow advertising plays a role\n\nLaPierre\u2019s sound bite is far from the only take on gun ownership.\n\nA recent ad for a Remington rifle \u2013 bolt-action not semiautomatic \u2013 touts the weapon: \u201cTop choice of elite military snipers, the Model 700 is unequaled in tactical precision. Whether defending freedom or pursuing big game, its out of the box accuracy is unmatched.\u201d\n\nAn advertising campaign dating back to at least 2012 for a Bushmaster AR-15 style rifle bears the slogan, \u201cConsider your man card reissued.\u201d\n\nA Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle was used in the Connecticut school shooting.\n\nHopkins sat silently for a moment, considering the ads.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably disturbing to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt kind of plays into some of the chaos we\u2019ve seen today, and it\u2019s frightening.\u201d\n\nWhat about the right to bear arms?\n\nMake no mistake. Hopkins believes in Second Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m for those rights with restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think military-grade weapons should be sold in the open market.\u201d\n\nThe country has seen what those weapons can do, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can name any one of these mass shootings,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cGenerally, there\u2019s an assault rifle attached to it.\u201d\n\nYet he felt no relief when Colt announced Sept. 19 that it would cease production of its semiautomatic AR-15 for consumers in what it couched as a business decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not going to make a difference because there are way too many guns out there today,\u201d Hopkins said. \"We're kind of behind the curve.\"\n\nKevin Lawrence of the Texas Municipal Police Association doesn't think the answers lie at the extremes.\n\nProhibiting everyone from carrying a gun will never work, Lawrence, executive director of the association, said. Allowing everyone to carry one won't, either.\n\nWhat are potential solutions?\n\n\u201cSomewhere, we all agree there\u2019s a threshold. We just have to figure out where that threshold is,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nTexas Municipal Police Association has supported red flag laws, and lie and try legislation, but those proposals have gone nowhere in the Texas Legislature, he said.\n\nA red flag law \u2013 also called an extreme risk protection order \u2013 allows the temporary confiscation of a person\u2019s weapons if he or she is considered a danger, according to Texas Gun Sense. A lie and try law makes it a crime for a person who is not supposed to have a gun to get one.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, \u201cconstitutional carry\u201d would allow anyone who legally has a handgun to carry it without a permit \u2013 open or concealed.\n\nState Rep. Jonathan Strickland, R-Bedford, introduced a constitutional carry proposal, House Bill 357, this year.\n\nBut he declared the legislation dead after a gun rights activist, angry at the bill's lack of progress, traveled to lawmakers' homes to push the bill.\n\nLawrence said the mislabeled measure doesn't garner the police association's support, including a provision prohibiting law enforcement officers from approaching someone to ask whether he or she is legally carrying a gun.\n\nIf an officer sees \u201ca guy armed to the teeth walking into Walmart,\u201d residents expect police to do their job and check him out, he said.\n\nGun measures attractive to law enforcement might seem obvious.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t we do something to get people to quit leaving their guns in their cars unlocked?\u201d Lawrence asked. \u201cWe need to be doing much more to educate our citizens and to advocate for responsible gun ownership.\u201d\n\n'The wild, wild West'\n\nOpen carry went into effect in Texas on Jan. 1, 2016. It was at first met with dismay.\n\n\u201cWhat we thought in law enforcement was ... we don\u2019t need the wild, wild West,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nOpen carry also removes the element of surprise, he said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t always want to let people know what you have,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s used against you. Sometimes it\u2019s taken away from you.\u201d\n\nHopkins said by the grace of God, most gun owners still opt for concealed carry.\n\nGuns and fallen officers\n\nLaw enforcement is by nature unpredictable.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen,\u201d Steve Wesbrook, executive director of the Texas Sheriff\u2019s Association, said. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s been that way from the beginning.\u201d\n\nWilkison pointed out that Texas leads the nation in line of duty deaths, so many that the Texas Peace Officers\u2019 Memorial on the Capitol grounds is nearly full of names.\n\nThe nonprofit Officers Down Memorial Page lists 1,964 such deaths in Texas, including 1,208 from gunfire.\n\nOn July 7, 2016, then Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez was just getting home when her cellphone started going crazy with text messages and calls about the shooting.\n\n\"It had been one of these 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. days, and I was just taking off my shoes,\" Valdez said during an interview in her home. \"When I saw that, the uniform went back on.\u201d\n\nShe went to the command center that stayed in operation the next 32 hours.\n\nValdez, 72, was in her fourth term as sheriff then. Her petite stature belies the larger than life career she carved out in law enforcement. Her election to the post in 2004 as a gay Latina garnered national attention.\n\nShe resigned as sheriff in December 2017 to make an unsuccessful run on the Democratic ticket against Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nSitting on a couch with her two dogs sleeping beside her on an October afternoon, Valdez looked back on that dark time in 2016.\n\nAt first, it was unknown how many snipers were taking aim at law enforcement officers, she said.\n\nIt hit her hard when it became clear a lone gunman had taken the lives of five fellow law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling sad,\" Valdez said. \"Why would you hate so much that you would take it out on someone you don\u2019t even know?\"\n\nBefore the attack, some of the officers had been having a good time socializing in the crowd.\n\n\"They were even joking together,\" Valdez said.\n\nThen, of course, she thought, \"There by the grace of God, go I.\"\n\n\"I was always in uniform. Somebody might take a shot at me, and all of us thought that,\" Valdez said. \"I could have been standing there.\"\n\nThe names and sculptured faces of the five officers killed July 7, 2016 \u2013 considered the deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since Sept. 11, 2001 \u2013 adorn a memorial outside Dallas police headquarters.\n\nDedicated July 8 this year, the 14-foot-tall monument honors fallen Dallas police officers Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Patrick Zamarripa and Sgt. Michael Smith, and Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer Brent Thompson.\n\nText on the bronze and stone memorial tells the story of the attack: A sniper ambushed unsuspecting officers leading a peaceful protest through downtown Dallas.\n\n\"Amid this chaos and terror, these brave officers ran towards the gunfire and began shielding the crowd with their bodies and moving them to positions of safety,\" the text continues.\n\nDallas police Chief U. Renee Hall, the daughter of a fallen officer, spoke at the unveiling.\n\n\u201cI can think of no truer definition of a hero,\u201d Hall, the city's first female police chief, said. \u201cAlthough we cannot match their sacrifice, it is our responsibility to match their sense of service and devotion to duty.\u201d\n\nHall, who took the position in 2017, declined to be interviewed for this story through the police media relations office.\n\nWith about 600 members, the Black Police Association of Greater Dallas serves not only Dallas cops but officers with agencies such as transit police and the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nHopkins has an easy manner and quick smile in his office at the association but prefers addressing issues head on.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people have not dealt with what happened on 7-7,\u201d he said. \u201cI know some folks actually resigned based on 7-7 and not only from Dallas.\u201d\n\nHopkins said that at several events over the last 10 years \u2013 not just 7-7 \u2013 law-enforcement officers have become targets.\n\nHopkins said mass shootings have made law enforcement officers more cautious, and, in his job particularly, he warns those who work events.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re there for a visual presence/deterrent, but you cannot get lackadaisical, thinking that just because you\u2019re there, it won\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\n\nIt only takes a split second for a gunman to walk up while an officer is distracted, he said.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s got the jump on you,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat finally stopped the gunman that night, whose sniper attack evolved into a standoff? It wasn't a \"good guy with a gun.\"\n\nPolice detonated a remote controlled robot armed with explosives, killing him.\n\nFollow Trish Choate on Twitter: @Trishapedia", "description": "The \"good guy with a gun\" stopping a mass shooter is ingrained in many gun enthusiasts' minds.
