So if Hariri gets out of the way and a Sunni Prime Minister is appointed, who is allied to Hezbollah, Lebanon could be sanctioned by the US,\" she said.\n\n\"So political leaders are staying together, they are clinging to power but people here are clinging on to their demands.\"\n\nLebanese army soldiers deploy during a protest targeting the government over an economic crisis [Ali Hashisho/Reuters]\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds gathered for the third day of protests against tax increases and alleged official corruption after the security forces made dozens of arrests.\n\nCrowds began gathering in front of the seat of government in Beirut around lunchtime, with many waving billowing Lebanese flags.\n\nEarlier, troops reopened blocked highways after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters who had gathered in the heart of Beirut on Friday evening.\n\nAl Jazeera's Khodr said more people are expected to arrive as the days move on.\n\n\"When you talk to people here and civil society movements they say they will not be deterred and that protests will continue,\" she said.\n\n\"They say harsh government crackdowns will not stop them as the government did use heavy handed tactics to disperse protesters.\"\n\nThe Internal Security Forces said 70 people have been arrested so far.\n\nA woman takes pictures as seen through the shattered glass of a damaged shop, a day after protests targeting the government over an economic crisis [Mohamed Azakir/Reuters]\n\nGroups of young people gathered on the streets of the capital on Saturday morning collecting tyres and other materials to make improvised roadblocks, AFP news agency's correspondents reported.\n\nParts of central Beirut looked like a war zone, littered with broken glass, overturned litter bins and the remains of burning tyres. Banks and many restaurants and shops remained closed.\n\nA team of workers in grey jumpsuits was dispatched to clean up the debris near parliament, even as around a dozen protesters chanted \"Revolution, revolution\".\n\nThe demonstrations first erupted on Thursday, sparked by a proposed 20 cent tax on calls via messaging apps such as WhatsApp.\n\nSuch calls are the main method of communication for many Lebanese and, despite the government's swift abandonment of the tax, the demonstrations quickly swelled into the largest in years.\n\nThousands of people of all ages, sects and political affiliations brought the capital to a standstill on Friday, before security forces dispersed them.\n\nProtests also began on Saturday in some areas in southern Lebanon, a region which is mainly controlled by the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement and Amal movement.\n\nLebanese citizens have been suffering from dire economic conditions in the heavily indebted country and from tax hikes, with anti-government protests erupting several times in recent months.\n\nLebanon is under pressure from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to implement austerity measures in return for financial support.\n\nThe country has one of the biggest public debt ratios in the world, equivalent to about 150 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).", "description": "Influential Hezbollah leader says the group does not want the government to resign but raises voice against new taxes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/19/9fdf0136a60442aebcd413fbe26771dc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
