The power utility also didn\u2019t have enough diesel to power its open cycle gas turbines, which resulted in power outages.\n\nCity Power also tweeted out that while loadshedding was not confirmed, it would be instituting planned power outages on October 20 and 21, with areas affected including Roodepoort, Berea and Hillbrow.\n\nALERT??:City Power received alert from Eskom concerning stage 2 load-shedding today between 09:00 -23:00.
