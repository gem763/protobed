Since kicking off the tour, Markle has been wearing low-key pieces that don\u2019t break the bank: take the $118 Madewell denim jacket that she wore yesterday, or the $86 wrap dress she wore the day before, by the Malawi-based brand Mayamiko. And today, once again, the Duchess opted for a very chic jumpsuit\u2014that retails for just $120.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess Of Sussex Visit South Africa Photo: Getty Images More\n\nThe accessible piece is by the brand Everlane. With its deep V neckline and mid-calf length, the brand\u2019s Japanese GoWeave Essential Jumpsuit strikes the perfect balance of dressy and casual\u2014and it comes in plenty of other colorways as well. Markle kept her overall look minimal, accessorizing only with black pointed pumps by Manolo Blahnik and a pair of statement earrings by Gas Bijoux; proof that, sometimes, a well-cut piece is all an outfit needs.\n\nAll products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.
