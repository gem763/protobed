Others simply make sense. And then there are features like the Galaxy Book Flex and Ion\u2019s Wireless PowerShare that appear to be more a product of a \u201cbecause we can\u201d approach to product design.\n\nWireless charging is, in and of itself, kind of a no-brainer in an era when many or most flagship smartphones support the technology. Samsung\u2019s implementation, however, leaves a lot to be desired here. It\u2019s true, of course, that Wireless PowerShare\u2019s implementation is less than ideal, requiring one of two phones to be face-down, but I can certainly see applications for the tech.\n\nOn the new laptops, however, charging the phone requires that it occupy all of the trackpad. In the case of the Flex, I suppose you can still use the touchscreen (there isn\u2019t one on the Ion), but even so, there\u2019s no scenario in which having a phone sitting on the trackpad doesn\u2019t seriously dampen one\u2019s ability to get some serious work done.\n\nBetween the issues and the fact that you can charge your phone the old-fashioned way with the laptops, it\u2019s hard to find a scenario in which the feature is anything but a gimmick. Samsung says the trackpad offered the easiest implementation of the tech \u2014 versus, I suppose the palm rest or the top of the device. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a great implementation for a feature that might have better been left on the drawing board.\n\nIt\u2019s a silly feature on what are otherwise very solid additions to Samsung\u2019s laptop line. The Flex is the more premium of the two, featuring a touchscreen and the 360-degree hinge that gives the device its name. The laptop has an aluminum body with a \u201croyal blue\u201d finish and a built-in slot for the included S Pen. It comes in both 13 and 15-inch varieties, with a 10th-gen Intel processor, 16GB of RAM and up to a TB of storage.\n\nAlso available in 13 and 15-inch versions, the Ion ditches the touchscreen and 360 hinge, but maintains an ultra-thin, lightweight design.\n\nSamsung\u2019s jumping the gun a little early on the announcement here. Both models will be available in the U.S. early next year, priced similarly to their predecessors. Asked why the company didn\u2019t just wait for CES for the announcement, it noted models arrive at different times in different markets.\n\nBased on past systems, it seems like a pretty safe bet that they\u2019ll be hitting Korean shores earlier. Perhaps in time for the holidays.", "description": "Some features are the result of consumer demand. Others simply make sense.
