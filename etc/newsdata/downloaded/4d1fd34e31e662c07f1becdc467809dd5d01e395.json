Carolina ahead of key House election The president will also have his own reelection bid in mind when he takes the stage.\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, N.C. \u2014 President Donald Trump headed here on Monday for an election-eve rescue mission in a neck-and-neck congressional race \u2014 and to boost his own standing in a key 2020 swing state.\n\nDan Bishop, a GOP state senator, is tied in the polls with Democrat Dan McCready in Tuesday\u2019s do-over election in the state\u2019s 9th District. And the Republican is counting on the president \u2014 along with Vice President Mike Pence, who campaigned for Bishop in another part of the district earlier Monday \u2014 to carry him across the finish line.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve caught [McCready], and I think we\u2019re passing him, or we passed him,\u201d Bishop told POLITICO in an interview over the weekend. \u201cI think the president coming in Monday \u2014 and the vice president \u2014 will put us over the top.\u201d\n\nBut Trump will also have his own reelection bid on his mind when he takes the stage for a rally in the 60,000-square-foot Crown Expo Center. North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes are critical for the president\u2019s campaign for a second term; he won the state by less than 4 percentage points in 2016.\n\nStill, the closeness of the congressional race \u2014 held in a district Trump won by 12 percentage points in 2016 \u2014 is an ominous sign for his reelection hopes and could suggest the political environment has not improved since the 2018 midterms, when the party lost 40 House seats.\n\nThe race between Bishop and McCready could make it 41 Democratic pickups: Last November, McCready appeared to lose the race by only 905 votes. But the state board of elections threw out the results after uncovering credible evidence of alleged election fraud linked to Republican Mark Harris\u2019 campaign, and it ordered a new election. Harris decided not to continue his candidacy.\n\nAttendees line up hours before President Donald Trump's Monday rally in Fayetteville, N.C. | Chris Seward/AP Photo\n\nThe rally comes as Trump plans to increase his campaign efforts after a summer that saw worries about a possible economic slowdown amid failed trade talks with China and a growing list of foreign policy shortfalls, from scuttled peace talks with the Afghan Taliban to nuclear negotiations with North Korea.\n\nAnd it comes after he spent much of the last week trying to prove that he was correct when he said Alabama might be impacted by Hurricane Dorian \u2014 even as North Carolina\u2019s coastal areas were suffering from the storm.\n\nTrump and his aides have grown increasingly concerned about the economy \u2014 his strongest re-election talking point \u2014 amid signs that a downtown may be on the way. Still, the Trump campaign focused on its strength when touting the president\u2019s record here.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has transformed the economy of North Carolina, creating more than 175,000 jobs in the state since he was elected,\u201d said Michael Glassner, the campaign\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies are often more about him than those he is endorsing \u2014 and he is expected to talk about his accomplishments, including money he secured to build a wall on the southern border, while using the platform, as he always does, to go after Democratic rivals and perceived slights.\n\nTrump\u2019s last rally in North Carolina was in July in Greenville, where he went after four freshman Democratic House members \u2014 the \u201csquad\u201d of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 and suggested they leave the country, even though all are U.S. citizens. \u201cSend her back,\u201d the crowd responded, referring to Omar, who is Muslim. Trump later denounced the chant.\n\nMonday night\u2019s rally is part of a multi-pronged effort from the Trump team to boost Bishop. Earlier Monday, Pence was in the Charlotte suburbs, speaking at an event with Bishop and dropping into a makeshift call center at a local hotel. The vice president also had lunch with Bishop at a barbecue restaurant. He was expected to make the 100-mile trip east to join Trump at the rally in Fayetteville, a military-heavy community anchored by nearby Fort Bragg.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Asked by a reporter to respond to Trump\u2019s past characterization of him as \u201cweak on Crime, Military & Vets,\u201d McCready cited his military service, including as a platoon leader in Iraq in 2007.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one person in this race who\u2019s served our country in uniform, who\u2019s actually fought terrorists, who\u2019s already fought to keep our country safe,\u201d McCready said. \u201cAnd it ain\u2019t Dan Bishop.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s rally is Trump\u2019s second campaign event in the state in the past three months. The July rally in Greenville was held in the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, which is also hosting a special election on Tuesday after the death of the incumbent Republican, Rep. Walter Jones, in February. Republican Greg Murphy is heavily favored to win the seat in the district, which Trump carried by 24 points in 2016.", "description": "The president will also have his own reelection bid in mind when he takes the stage.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard", "Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a1/0e/dbe7e6f0409aa2ceb5483f89a4f2/20190909-donald-trump-gen-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
