She scored 6,533 international runs to finish second on England women\u2019s all-time list of run-scorers, behind her long-term captain, Charlotte Edwards.\n\n\u201cThis has been a tough decision but I know it\u2019s the right one, for me and for my health moving forward,\u201d Taylor said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank my team mates enough, both past and present, and the ECB for being supporters and friends along my journey.\n\n\u201cPlaying for England and getting to wear the shirt for so long has been a dream come true and I have been blessed with so many great moments throughout my career.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s 232 dismissals across all three formats is a record for women\u2019s internationals. She was part of England\u2019s World Cup-winning team of 2017, scoring 396 runs in the tournament at an average of 49.50.\n\n\u201cSarah can be immensely proud of everything she has achieved in an England shirt, and of everything she has done for the women\u2019s game,\u201d Clare Connor, managing director of England women\u2019s cricket, said.\n\n\u201cShe is someone that young people can look up to, for her achievements and talent on the pitch \u2013 but also for her bravery and resilience off it. She has come through significant adversity and performed on the world stage for her country.\u201d", "description": "England women's wicketkeeper-batsman Sarah Taylor has retired from international cricket because of her ongoing battle with anxiety, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434526021&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0UY", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
