Business Insider Intelligence\n\nNeobanks, digital-only banks that aren't saddled by traditional banking technology and costly networks of physical branches, have been working to redefine retail banking in major markets around the world.\n\nTop neobanks in the US & EU\n\nThe top neobanks in the US and EU include:\n\nOakNorth (EU)\n\nN26 (EU)\n\nAtom Bank (EU)\n\nRevolut (EU)\n\nMonzo (EU)\n\nChime (US)\n\nStarling Bank (EU)\n\nVaro (US)\n\nAspiration (US)\n\nDriven by innovation-friendly regulatory reforms, these companies have especially gained traction in Europe over the last three years. While the US is home to some of the oldest neobanks \u2014 including Simple, which set up shop in 2009, and Moven, which was founded in 2011 \u2014 the country's neobank ecosystem has lagged behind its European counterpart.\n\nThat's largely because of an onerous regulatory regime, which has made it very difficult to obtain a banking license, and the entrenched position incumbents hold in the financial lives of US consumers. Navigating the tedious and costly scheme for obtaining a banking charter and appropriate approvals has been a major stumbling block for the country's digital banking upstarts. However, developments over the past year suggest these startups are finally poised for the spotlight in the US.\n\nNeobanks vs Traditional banks\n\nConsumers', particularly millennials', growing frustration with legacy banking service providers, combined with their increased appetite for digital solutions, has accelerated the shift to digital-only banking. Startups and tech-savvy players are redefining the retail banking space and forcing incumbents to either evolve or lose out on this key business segment.\n\nIn The Evolution of the US Neobank Market, Business Insider Intelligence maps out the factors contributing to this shifting tide, examines how key players are positioning themselves to take advantage, and explores how incumbents can embark on their own digital transformations to stave off disruption.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report include: Aspiration, Chime, Goldman Sachs' Marcus, JPMorgan Chase's Finn, N26, and Revolut.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nDespite lagging behind Europe, recent developments suggest that neobanks are finally ready for the spotlight in the US.\n\nThree distinct influences are responsible for creating the fertile ground for this evolution: regulation, shifting consumer attitudes, and the activity of incumbent banks.\n\nAmong those driving this evolution in the US are foreign neobanks including Germany's N26 and UK-based Revolut.\n\nMeanwhile, two notable incumbent-owned outfits have deployed amid great fanfare: Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Finn by Chase.\n\nIn this increasingly competitive landscape, incumbent banks have a range of strategic options at their disposal, including overhauling their entire business for the digital era.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nDetails the factors contributing to a shift in the US' neobank market.\n\nExplains the different operating models neobanks in the US are deploying to roll out their services and meet consumer demands.\n\nHighlights how incumbent banks are tapping into the advantages offered by stand-alone digital outfits.\n\nDiscusses the key strategies established players need to deploy to remain relevant in the US' increasingly digital banking landscape.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
