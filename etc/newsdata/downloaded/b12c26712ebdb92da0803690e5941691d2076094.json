I used my powder and just lightly drew on symmetrical eyebrows, a bit like mine.\n\n(Image: CATERS NEWS)\n\n\"I couldn't stop laughing which woke Isabella up so I took a quick photo and wiped them off. My friends and I haven't stopped laughing. It is a photo I will keep forever and I might even put it on her 18th birthday cake.\"\n\nBut not everyone thought the photo was as funny as the mum did, with one person even commenting to accuse Danielle of \"child abuse\".\n\nAnd while this made her feel like she had \"done something wrong\", she claims that she has no regrets and would do it again.\n\nShe added: \"Some people commented saying it is 'child abuse' which made me feel like I had done something wrong.\n\n\"But I didn't put my baby in danger and the other mums in the Facebook group defended me. I would probably do it again because it is that funny.\"", "description": "A mum shared a hilarious photo of her newborn with drawn on eyebrows but not everyone found it funny", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743697.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-BABY-ON-FLEEK-MUM-DRAWS-EYEBROWS-ON-KID.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
