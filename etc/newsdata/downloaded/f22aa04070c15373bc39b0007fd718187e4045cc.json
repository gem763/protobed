But if you\u2019re looking for the big secret that will unlock the solution to the show\u2019s lingering mysteries, you won\u2019t get it from star Rosa Salazar. \u201cI will offer no answers,\u201d she warns me, laughing, at the top of our conversation.\n\nUndone fires on all cylinders, but you can imagine how the whole show could have failed without Salazar\u2019s stunning lead performance to pull it all together. Salazar plays Alma Winograd-Diaz, who, in the wake of a near-fatal car accident, may or may not have developed the ability to travel through time. Between the unusual filming process required for the series\u2019 rotoscope animation, the complexity of both the main character and the plot, and the fact that Salazar appears in the vast majority of the show\u2019s scenes, Undone would have presented a considerable challenge for any actor. Somehow, in an eight-episode first season that\u2019s both narratively intricate and heartbreakingly human, Salazar never puts a foot wrong.\n\nHer first encounter with Undone was, appropriately enough, a little magical. She was meeting with casting director Linda Lamontagne about an entirely different project when Lamontagne brought up Undone out of the blue. \u201cShe opens this secret drawer and says, \u2018Read this, right now, in front of me,\u2019\u201d Salazar recalls. \u201cAnd reading it cold \u2014 oh man, I was holding back tears. Even the first time I read it. It just felt like the universe or the powers that be just handed it to me. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I left her office shaking my head, like I lived through a dream.\u201d\n\nFortunately, despite her initial teasing, Salazar was willing to share her candid thoughts on Undone\u2019s fascinating characters, twisty plot, and ambiguous ending \u2014 and even hint at places where viewers who are desperate for closure might find some answers.\n\n[Spoilers for Undone below.]\n\nFor this show, it feels right to start by going back to the beginning. What do you remember about your first meeting with [Undone co-creators] Kate Purdy and Raphael Bob-Waksberg?\n\nWe had a two-and-a-half-hour conversation: our experiences with mental health, our own questions. They walked me through the character\u2019s journey, the journey of the show. It was sort of like a therapeutic session because Kate shared her inspiration for making the show, which was her own experience with mental illness and her own breakup and her grandmother actually being diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\nI am a huge BoJack Horseman fan, so I already knew [Bob-Waksberg\u2019s] writing and where he was coming from. He loves to investigate the dark side of life and how it coincides with the humorous side of life. And that\u2019s exactly where I stem from. I know for a fact that comedy and tragedy are one.\n\nAnd they showed me a test they did, and I was so floored by the test itself. It was done in rotoscope \u2014 and by the very people that did my favorite movie, Waking Life, which I watched millions of times in my formative life. And I thought, Rotoscope, wow, this is the only way to do this show. It keeps the audience wondering, Are we in a dream, or are we in reality? And that\u2019s where we wanted them to be.\n\nWhat was the filming process like \u2014 just the cast in a big empty room?\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s also extremely challenging. I\u2019ve never put that much of myself \u2014 physically, mentally, spiritually \u2014 into another project, ever. You would assume that something like Alita: Battle Angel would be an even bigger undertaking with the performance-capture suits and the gadgets that are strapped to me and the helmet and the whole tech side of things added to your normal process. But that was a much larger beast and a much slower-moving beast, so there was a lot of downtime. Undone is TV, so that always moves pretty fast. But it was so stripped down because of the rotoscope process. There are no light changes; everything is lit very harshly from above so you can get every nuance and shadow and line on the faces and the bodies and the clothes. It was like performing in a black-box theater. You have a bar scene? \u201cHere\u2019s a high table and two stools and two cups. There you go, there\u2019s your bar.\u201d Okay, done with the bar scene! \u201cTime for the bedroom scene. Wheel in the bed!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so stripped down that it moves so incredibly fast, and we shot so many pages a day. But what I loved about that is that it keeps you in the moment. And because there\u2019s so much less to interact with, the moment is everything. For an actor, that turned me on so much, and it gave me this momentum that you just never have on other sets, which can be like, \u201cOkay, we got your coverage. That\u2019s lunch. See you in an hour and a half, and we\u2019ll do the other half of this scene.\u201d\n\nThis was nothing like that. It was \u201cWe\u2019ll do the scene three or four times. Two or three times. Maybe one time. And then we\u2019ll move on.\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re performing lengthy scenes in a mostly empty room, do you have a sense of how, say, the room will look when it\u2019s animated? Or are the animators figuring that out once they\u2019ve seen the footage?\n\n[Director Hisko Hulsing] had this incredibly large binder of every single frame of the show, hand-drawn by him. He would come over and say, \u201cDon\u2019t step there, because that\u2019s a piano. Don\u2019t walk over there, because that\u2019s going through a wall.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the specific boundaries of Alma\u2019s ability, which seems to be almost limitless at times.\n\nWell \u2026 does she have an ability?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI never answered that question for myself. I couldn\u2019t. And if I had, it wouldn\u2019t have worked. For every scene, I had to walk through the script and go, Okay. What are the multiple solutions for this? I had multiple outs for every scene, where I could go, If I play it this way, am I tipping my hand too much in one direction? And sometimes you want to tip it a little more, and sometimes you want to reserve it. But you always want to be in the fluctuating space of that question. The desire for answers. And the silence that follows.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the feeling that hangs in the air after the season finale.\n\nMy answer to that is going to be very disappointing, which is: There is no answer. But I would also pose this to you: Is there anything more disappointing than actually having an answer?\n\nI have a tendency to go on a rant when it comes to this question because it\u2019s sort of open to interpretation. That\u2019s the last scene of the last episode, which is sort of a Rorschach test for your beliefs. If you choose the mental-illness route, Alma is deteriorating and all of her relationships are falling apart and she\u2019s burning it all down. And perhaps that is mental illness gaining its strength. Or, as her power really is strengthening, she is becoming unglued to the reality that everyone else believes to be true. And she is committing to her power but pushing away the people closest to her, who have no insight into her ability, because they don\u2019t share it.\n\nIt\u2019s a multipronged answer, and there are probably a few more prongs than that. But for every single scene, I was looking at it and saying, Okay, what is the magic of this? And how would you and I \u2014 people who are not, potentially, schizophrenic \u2014 how would we see this?\n\nBut I go back to saying it\u2019s better not to have the answer. I was really happy when people were disappointed with the last episode. I was so happy! Because to me, that\u2019s what the beauty of life is predicated on \u2014 searching for answers. If we\u2019d answered it either way, I think on the surface, people would have been satisfied. But I think \u2014 subconsciously \u2014 if we\u2019d answered it either way, there would have been a death. The death of the other side.\n\nWhat about you, Scott? What do you think?\n\nIn principle, I\u2019m with you. And in general, I think Undone is very cagey about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, and very clever about which POV it chooses to show us at a given time.\n\nRight.\n\nBut the thing that trips me up is Nancy the security guard [whom Alma successfully disarms by empathizing about Nancy\u2019s never-mentioned missing sister]. Because objectively, it seems like Alma has so much information about Nancy that she couldn\u2019t have obtained any other way. To me, it felt like confirmation that Alma\u2019s ability was real.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting, right? Because that episode is from outside Alma\u2019s perspective. And Sam says, \u201cWow, did you get all that from her screen saver?\u201d\n\nBut Alma knows everything. She even knows the name of Nancy\u2019s missing sister!\n\nI wrestled with that scene. I really, really did. Because as I was performing it, I\u2019m going, \u201cThis tips our hand.\u201d We didn\u2019t even know the truth. On set, Kate would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d And I was the viewer, going, \u201cBut, but, but!\u201d And she would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo I wrestled with that. And in my mind, because we\u2019re seeing it from the outside, it could very well be that Alma has this ability. Or \u2026 she did some research. Which is the most boring answer of all time! But everyone gets tripped up on Nancy. There is a screen saver. There are pictures. How could she know this woman\u2019s sister had died? It could have been a wild guess. She could have done research. But because we\u2019re not with [Alma] in that episode, we really don\u2019t know how she got that information.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this question I think you wrote about: the gap in Jacob\u2019s memory of the accident.\n\nYes, I did.\n\nThat\u2019s another one people are getting tripped up on. I think there\u2019s a more concrete, two-pronged answer to that one for me. The first way is that this is all in Alma\u2019s head, and she has no further information because her relationship with her father ended that night on the sidewalk. That\u2019s where the memory ends. If it\u2019s a schizophrenic break, she\u2019s creating an explanation to mend the trauma of losing her father. That, potentially, is the answer.\n\nOkay, I can buy that.\n\nThe other potential answer is that when people are traumatized \u2014 even if they caused the event \u2014 they usually shut down or block it out. I read this book while I was filming this project called The Body Keeps the Score, by Bessel van der Kolk, and it really linked with the script. It talks about how trauma is embedded in our molecular structure. Buried in places in our minds. When Jacob is talking about the lineage stored in our minds, where good and bad have been compartmentalized \u2014 it\u2019s true! We do carry a world inside of us. And not just our stories. Our father\u2019s father\u2019s father\u2019s stuff. As a half-Peruvian woman, I wonder what I\u2019m carrying with me.\n\nAnd I think Jacob\u2019s memory could have ended on the sidewalk because that was the moment of the mistake he made. And then the memory of the murder-suicide was so traumatic to him that he blocked it out, and it wasn\u2019t until they got closer to solving the mystery that it triggered the memory. That\u2019s when he finds out and says, \u201cYou have to go back.\u201d\n\nClearly, you had to think about how to play every scene, accounting for at least two different possibilities. Are there any specific scenes you\u2019d suggest viewers go back and revisit once they\u2019ve seen the entirety of the series \u2014 something that might play differently with additional context, or just provide some cool Easter eggs?\n\nOh yeah. I\u2019ll probably get fired for saying this. [Laughs] I recommend going back to the first two episodes. When I look at them, I\u2019m like, This is very blatant. This is very obvious to me. Based on my own assumptions. Again, I don\u2019t even have answers; I\u2019m just an actor. But to me, the first two episodes are very telling for what I believe to be the truth. There are many, many Easter eggs. It just links perfectly, full circle, to the eighth episode.\n\nWhen Jacob is giving her the speech \u2014 \u201cYou can go back to your life, or you can try something different\u201d \u2014 you see this montage. And you see a lot of little \u2026 hints in all directions. You also get that big speech that [Becca] gives: \u201cThe clouds, the birds, the trees.\u201d And she is literally saying the same things that Alma says to Cassie in the first episode. To me, that was very much, like, everything is connected. Perhaps this is not the first time she\u2019s even gone through this cycle.\n\nYou also see [Alma say], \u201cI\u2019m not here. I\u2019m two weeks from now. I\u2019m at home with Sam.\u201d And then there we are in episode five, and she\u2019s in the house with Sam. There are many, many Easter eggs, and most of them are in episodes one and two.\n\nYou probably just sent every Undone superfan scrambling back to their couch for a rewatch.\n\nI\u2019ve seen every episode umpteen times.\n\nLike any good superfan.\n\nLook, this is the thing I\u2019m most proud of in my entire career. For personal reasons, because I was working through \u2026 I mean, my own relationship with both of my parents, through this show.\n\nIt seems like Undone came from a very personal and intimate place for everyone involved.\n\nOh, absolutely. People ask me what relationship in the show was the most fun to dive into, and they were all amazing. But for me \u2014 and for everyone, let\u2019s be honest, and for Freud \u2014 it\u2019s always the parents, right? [Laughs] This is what I mean when I say this was serendipitous. I was coming to this point where I was like, I need to unpack my relationship with my own mother. I\u2019ve talked, really openly, about the tense relationship I had with my mother. And in Undone, I just saw the opportunity to explore that. Sort of like \u2026 reenactment therapy? Reenact my life, and my relationship, through Alma and Camila.\n\nWhat I came out with was really interesting, this idea that we never fully forgive our mothers for doing their best. And it brought a sense of accountability and empathy that I never really had before. It really felt like growing up, when I was doing this show. And it was really beautiful.\n\nEpisode six is particularly poignant in the way it shifts the spotlight to Camila, Alma\u2019s mother.\n\nIt\u2019s very, very touching. Because look, I did the same thing. My father has passed. And we all sort of glorify one parent. Especially when they\u2019re gone, it\u2019s like, he was the king. You know? And you bestow these otherworldly qualities to this person who was a fallible human being and was potentially not the best guy. I mean, I love my father, and who\u2019s going to change that? But I definitely [ascribed] these grandiose characteristics to my father while never forgiving my mother for doing her best.\n\nWhen I worked through it as Alma, I was doing the same thing. It definitely changed my life. This show sort of moved through me in a very cathartic way \u2014 which is a very overused word, but it\u2019s true. As actors, we\u2019re always trying to achieve that feeling, and I felt it every day on Undone. It was very therapeutic for all of us. We all talked about a lot of our experiences.\n\nWhat I found most affecting, whether you believe Alma has a superpower or not, is the way her ability eventually manifests as a kind of extreme empathy: the way she can experience another person in full and see everything that made them who they are, and how that always leaves her in a place of acceptance and forgiveness.\n\nAbsolutely. Oh God, I\u2019m gonna cry now. That episode with Sam. Hoo. It\u2019s really special. I literally get chills every time. The idea that she could go back and see his story of being the other and having to abandon what he\u2019s known. That\u2019s Alma\u2019s whole origin story \u2014 having a community at the deaf school and being ripped from that. Being Mexican-American and Jewish. Being this person who rejects the notion of conformity in all respects. She is other. And Sam is other. And once she learns that, she says, \u201cOh, I get it now.\u201d\n\nIf only we all had that ability to zoom straight into someone\u2019s origin story, our loved one who we\u2019re just hating at the moment. And if we could just go, \u201cOh! That\u2019s why you did this unspeakable, weird thing. You were afraid of losing me. You weren\u2019t being vindictive. You were afraid, and that\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d We all wish fights would end that way: \u201cI get it, I forgive you, I love you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been the theme of this interview, so I have to ask you another question you might not be able to answer: Will there be more Undone?\n\nI certainly hope so. It could go on and on. And it also could stop right there, just leaving everyone with the same questions they\u2019ve been asking before the show came into existence. I want to know so much more. I\u2019m just like you. But at the same time, it\u2019s beautiful the way that it is. If they say, \u201cThis is a natural conclusion,\u201d I would be like, \u201cI can\u2019t argue.\u201d And that\u2019s also very beautiful.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "A Q&A with Rosa Salazar about the Amazon Prime animated series Undone, sharing the episodes in which viewers who are desperate for closure might find some answers.", "authors": ["Scott Meslow"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/01/01-rosa-salazar-chat-room-silo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
