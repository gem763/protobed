Students were not allowed to ask questions.\n\nColumbia newspaper The State reported that about half the tickets for the event were reserved for guests of the administration, while the other half were distributed locally. The school told the paper there were spots saved for up to 10 students.\n\nHarris said she plans to hold a criminal justice roundtable elsewhere in the state Saturday, instead.\n\nPrevious winners of the Bipartisan Justice Award include Harris and Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican.\n\nOther Democratic presidential candidates still taking part in the forum at Benedict over the next two days are former Rep. John Delaney, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.", "description": "Trump was given the award Friday at the event, where, even though it was taking place at historically black college, student attendance was limited.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4260014/1000x563_nbc-190812-kamala-harris-asian-and-latino-coalition-ac-1033p_63d689b41b258d7657c558aa991dd573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
