The largest of the wooden figureheads to be rescued is a 13-foot tall, two-tonne standing figure of William IV (pictured) that was carved in 1833 in Devonport and belonged to the HMS Royal William or 'King Billy'\n\nThe figurehead harks back to the orders of chivalry, which were societies of knights typically inspired by the Catholic military orders of the Crusades. Here, the figure wears ceremonial robes with three detailed 'collars' of the orders. The uppermost collar represents the Scottish Order of the Thistle, the central collar shows the Irish Order of St Patrick and the lowest of the three is the English Order of the Garter\n\nBelow the three collars hangs the 'George' in the form of St George slaying the dragon. The full-length figurehead was removed from the HMS Royal William when the ship was converted to steam in 1860 and it was replaced with a smaller bust\n\nThe figurehead harks back to the orders of chivalry, which were societies of knights typically inspired by the Catholic military orders of the Crusades, as he wears ceremonial robes and 'collars' of the orders.\n\nThe full-length figurehead was removed from the HMS Royal William when the ship was converted to steam in 1860 and it was replaced with a smaller bust.\n\nOne of the most badly damaged figureheads in the collection was from the HMS Topaz.\n\nOne of the most badly damaged in the collection of figureheads was from HMS Topaz that had to be photo. The three-quarter-length female bust was carved in 1858, also in Devonport. Pictured: The bust being photographed before being painstakingly restored\n\nThe ship it featured on, HMS Topaz, was was responsible for removing two of the Easter Island statues in 1868 that are now in the British Museum's collection. Pictured: The figurehead halfway through restoration\n\nThe figurehead wears a tight bodice, a full skirt and a diadem - a type of crown - with swept back hair. The edges of her skirt are carved with oak branches and in the centre is an oak wreath that surrounds a star, crescent moon and sun.

The half-length figure managed to survive and represents a young Queen Victoria who is crowned and holding an orb and sceptre\n\nThe figurehead also wears a bracelets and the collar of the Order of the Garter. The base is carved with roses, a shamrock and a thistle. The collection, which altogether weighs more than 20 tonnes, will go on display in Plymouth, Devon, early next year\n\nConservators used amazing techniques including Sonic Tomography - a method designed for measuring decay cavities within living trees - to save the outer shells.\n\nThey then carefully replaced the rotting wood and the items were repainted.\n\nThe collection will go on display in The Box in Plymouth, Devon, which will be the largest museum and art gallery space when it opens in spring next year.\n\nThe HMS Sybille figurehead was also among those restored during the project. The female figure stands wearing a white dress and powder-blue cloak with her arms folded behind her back. It is based on a mythical woman called Sybil who is thought to have expressed her oracles in the form of riddles\n\nShe was originally made in 1846 for the sum of \u00a318 in today's money. The figurehead briefly found her way into the Devonport collection after the ship she belonged to was taken to pieces but by the 1950s it was transferred to HMS Sea Eagle in Londonderry. The sculpture stayed at the army's Ebrington Barracks until 2003\n\nThe restoration project, which was led by Plymouth City Council, is considered to be one of the most significant of its kind in a generation\n\nThe figureheads, which collectively weigh more than 20 tonnes, will be suspended from the ceiling in the exhibition to 'create the effect of a fleet of carvings floating in space'.\n\nLed by Plymouth City Council, the project is considered one of the most significant of its kind in a generation.\n\nCouncil leader Tudor Evans said: 'The figureheads are more than just wooden sculptures; they're iconic symbols of the history of the city of Plymouth and the Royal Navy.\n\nThe HMS Aurora (left) figurehead was made in Cosham, Portsmouth, in 1855. The three-quarter length female bust is nude above the waist. Her hair falls across her shoulders and she wears a crown of sea shells. A figurehead of the King of Thebus (right) - a bearded male bust crowned, wearing a plate-mail tunic and draped in a red cloak - was carved in 1855 for the HMS Cadmus\n\n'They're also fantastic representations of the craftsmanship and skill of the sculptors who made them over 200 years ago.\n\n'Right from the start when we were developing our original concepts for The Box we wanted to have a 'flotilla' of figureheads suspended from the ceiling of the new entrance in a nod to Plymouth's important maritime history and as the place where great journeys start from.'\n\nAnother challenge of restoring the figureheads was how to replicate the original colour scheme of each individual sculpture.\n\nThe conservation team tracked down a set of 1912 full colour cigarette cards (pictured) featuring the navy's most famous figureheads from the previous century which helped them to create a palette of colours to complete the restoration\n\nThe figurehead for HMS Calliope resembled one of the nine Greek mythological daughters of Zeus and the muse of epic poetry. The half-length figure wears a white dress with gold belt detail below the bust as well as wearing a gold diadem\n\nThe HMS Calcutta (left) figurehead was removed and given to the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher upon his retirement. A full-length figure of HMS Centaur (right) was carved in 1842. Its right hand rests on the horse's body with its left hand clasped and resting on its forehead\n\nThe conservation team did a cross-section paint analysis to determine the original colours of each figurehead as they had been painted over many times.\n\nThey were then also able to track down a set of 1912 full colour cigarette cards featuring the navy's most famous figureheads from the previous century.\n\nConservators made up a palette of colours inspired by the cigarette cards that was then used to restore each of the 14 figureheads when they came to be repainted.\n\nThe creation date for the figurehead of HMS Tamar is unknown. The male three-quarter length figure depicts a bearded bare chested river god with a laurel wreath adorning is head\n\nTeams from London, Devon and Cornwall were all involved in the project which was carried out by Orbis Conservation after they were loaned the collection by the National Museums Of The Royal Navy.\n\nDirectors and co-founders Hans Thompson and Maxwell Malden said: 'Throughout this project we have uncovered the previously obscured craftsmanship and virtuoso carving of these formidable figures, which otherwise might have been lost to future generations.\n\n'The fact that we have been able to save so much of the original carvings to be appreciated anew by visitors to the Box has made this project especially rewarding.'\n\nMr Thompson added that many were so severely damaged that their insides resembled 'saturated compost'.\n\nHe said: 'Imagine walking through a forest, that nice smell of rotting vegetation.\n\n'We were pulling the (insides) away with our hands.\n\n'They were that degraded.\n\n'It was considered bad karma to wantonly destroy them when they broke up the ships because they were seen as the soul of the ships.\n\n'So they had acres and acres of these objects and they ended up going to village greens, parks, end of peers and naval establishments.\n\n'They were put on display outside, in the elements, and not properly maintained.\n\n'The water would get in and rot would start.\n\n'Brown rot eats from the inside out.\n\n'Fortuitously it hadn't eaten all the way through to the surface.'\n\nEach in the collection has an extraordinary history.\n\nMr Thompson said: 'We found a musket ball in one of them and boreholes from larvae the size of which you'd never see in Europe, clearly from tropical beetles. They've lived quite exciting lives.'", "description": "The figureheads, which collectively weigh more than 20 tonnes, will go on display in Plymouth, Devon, next year.
