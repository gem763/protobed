Wales showcased their ability to hit the ground running against Georgia, scoring after just two minutes, while Australia went the other way against Fiji. Heading into half-time, Michael Cheika\u2019s men found themselves 14-12 down after a slow and loose start.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

An early Welsh blitz can therefore provide Warren Gatland\u2019s side with the foundations they need to control the flow of the rest of the game. Of course, Australia pose a very different challenge to Georgia. So how do Wales get under their opponents\u2019 skin early on?\n\nTarget the Wallabies\u2019 backline\n\nWales tested the full range of their aerial-based assaults against Georgia, reaping rich rewards. Against Australia, a similar approach must be deployed.\n\nWith Israel Folau absent, Australia\u2019s backline will find itself susceptible to the box kicks of Gareth Davies and high balls of Dan Bigger. Full-back Kurtley Beale has struggled in the past when confronted with sustained aerial bombardments while George North\u2019s 14cm height advantage over winger Marika Koroibete must be utilised.\n\nIt\u2019s always a gamble handing possession back to opposing teams, especially one of Australia\u2019s calibre, but Wales cannot afford to be conservative when the stakes are this high.\n\nTest the waters with a rush defence\n\nWales know that their opponents are prone to careless errors \u2013 that as much was clear against Fiji, with the Wallabies repeatedly dropping play in the first half due to poor handling. While the aerial ball is one avenue to explore in forcing mistakes, Gatland\u2019s men shouldn\u2019t be afraid to test the water with a rush defence.\n\nSuch an approach can leave teams vulnerable in behind, as South Africa found out against New Zealand once they had adjusted to their rivals\u2019 high line, but in Liam Williams they have a full-back capable of reading the finest details of a game. A rush defence will not only unsettle the Aussies but equally allow Wales the chance to nullify the threat posed by battering ram Samu Kerevi, a player whose explosive power and hard running will be of concern.\n\nMore of the same from Gareth Davies\n\nThe scrum-half was outstanding on Monday night. His speed, quick service and ability to drift along the line was crucial to unpicking the Georgians. More than just a bridge between the forwards and backs, he was seen making wrap-arounds and arching darts off the rucks and mauls to provide Wales with an additional running threat.\n\nAustralia will be aware of this and will be looking to shutdown those extra dimensions to Davies\u2019 game, but this is where his forward protectors enter into the equation. Keep the ball moving up front, suck in the Australian pack and create those opportunities for Davies to work his magic when he sees fit.\n\nKeep it safe in the scrum\n\nFinally the scrum, arguably Wales\u2019 most vulnerable point in their defensive armour. During Monday\u2019s clash in Toyota, Georgia won four scrum penalties to two against the Welsh \u2013 one of which culminated in a try for the eastern Europeans. Throughout the summer, too, the Six Nations champions struggled to assert themselves in this area.\n\nThe Wallabies would typically avoid engaging in an arm wrestle at the scrum, such are their own shortcomings here, but they may be willing to make an exception on this occasion. Wales must therefore be prepared for a fierce fight up front, one that is kept clean and free of sloppy mistakes. For the sake of giving his forwards the best chance of holding their own, Gatland should consider keeping Wyn Jones, Ken Owens and Tomas Francis on for as long as possible in Tokyo. Once the reserve front-rows enter the fray, the risk of ill discipline and game-changing penalties increases \u2013 as was the case against Georgia. Wales cannot afford to let this happen in the closing stages of Sunday\u2019s match.", "description": "In the second heavyweight collision of the Rugby World Cup group stages, Australia\u00a0and Wales\u00a0go head to head in a showdown that promises high-octane drama, world-class rugby and the likely guarantee of a first-place finish in Pool D.
