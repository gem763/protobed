After moving the release date up from September 30th, iPadOS brings some highly anticipated features to Apple\u2019s tablet line. The most obvious one is the addition of widgets to the home screen. These can be displayed alongside the regular app icons, and it allows for a little more customization on what was previously a very static iPad home screen.\n\nThis is the first iteration of iPadOS, and it naturally includes many of the iOS 13 features you\u2019d expect to see like dark mode, updates to Apple Maps, Photos, and Reminders, and even things like Xbox and PS4 controller support for iPads. Apple is also adding what it describes as \u201cdesktop-class\u201d browsing to Safari, and tweaking its multitasking features. An updated Files app should also make it easier to manage files and photos on an iPad.\n\nRelated 7 good and 3 bad things in iPadOS\n\niPadOS is available now on an iPad Air 2 or later, an iPad Pro, a fifth-generation or later iPad, or iPad mini 4 or later. Alongside iPadOS, Apple is also releasing iOS 13.1 to compatible iPhone devices today, with some much-needed bug fixes, automated Siri Shortcut actions, a share ETA feature in Apple Maps, and data separation for enterprise devices. You can get iOS 13.1 or iPadOS from settings > general > software update. If you\u2019re still on the public beta profile, you\u2019ll need to remove this from your device to see iOS 13.1 or iPadOS.", "description": "Apple is releasing its first iPadOS update for all compatible iPad tablets today.
