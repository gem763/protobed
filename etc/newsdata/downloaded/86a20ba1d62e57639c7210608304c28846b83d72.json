We are republishing the piece as the film hits theaters this weekend.\n\nDick Long opens with an unhinged, freewheeling night of drug-booze-and-firecracker-fueled hedonism, then cuts to its two nitwit protagonists, Zeke (Michael Abbott Jr.) and Earl (Andre Hyland) frantically driving their mortally wounded bandmate and bud Dick (Scheinert himself) to the local hospital, where they intend to abandon his body outside of the emergency room. Before they drop him off, they literally drop him \u2014 accidentally, a couple of times \u2014 and then take his wallet, so that he can\u2019t be identified.\n\nAs might be expected, Dick dies not long afterward, and the rather alarming nature of his injuries \u2014 multiple head contusions, along with severe rectal hemorrhaging \u2014 prompts panic across their sleepy Alabama hamlet that a band of psychos might be on the loose. (We do know, by the way, that Dick\u2019s death was accidental; what we do not know for most of the picture is just what exactly happened to him, a revelation Scheinert wisely keeps hidden until we\u2019re good and ready for it.) Meanwhile, Zeke has to deal with the rather incriminating pool of blood in his back seat, while Earl makes plans to skip town, and Dick\u2019s wife (Jess Weixler) begins wondering where her probably two-timing husband is. The local sheriff (Janelle Cochrane) and the not-too-bright Officer Dudley (Sarah Baker) get on the case, and despite having a number of clues \u2014 including the wallet that Zeke took from Dick \u2014 they don\u2019t seem particularly able to put two and two together.\n\nScheinert himself comes from small-town Alabama, and there\u2019s a surreal specificity throughout \u2014 cutaways to odd bits of local color, as well as occasional in-jokes that even those of us who aren\u2019t in on the joke can identify as in-jokes \u2014 that lends the film a sense of authenticity. But he also isn\u2019t afraid to indulge in what we might consider stereotypes. These two ragged, half-baked, Papa Roach\u2013loving buffoons make the worst decisions so consistently that the story borders on Dadaist. Between their rampant idiocies, and the glacial incompetence of the local cops, The Death of Dick Long becomes a symphony of stupidity. I say \u201csymphony\u201d because it\u2019s multivoiced and overpowering. That\u2019s part of the movie\u2019s charm, too: You can feel your brain melting away as you watch it, and that\u2019s not always a bad sensation.\n\nDick Long does try to get serious in its later scenes, before it pulls off a couple of final, deeply twisted reveals. But the attempts to provide emotional weight feel somewhat unearned and uneven, as Zeke contends with his faltering marriage to Lydia (Virginia Newcomb). One senses an attempt on Scheinert\u2019s part to pull off the kind of transformation that the Coen brothers achieved in films like Raising Arizona and Fargo, where the freewheeling quirkiness eventually builds to something resembling pathos. But many of his characters, as entertaining as they are, don\u2019t quite have the dimensionality to make that work. (Save perhaps for Lydia: Newcomb is phenomenal, juggling disbelief, disgust, horror, and anguish without ever losing sight of both the pathos and silliness of the situation.) That tonal mismatch aside, however, The Death of Dick Long is a delirious and entertaining dumbshit backwoods noir.", "description": "\u201cSwiss Army Man\u201d co-director Daniel Scheinert returns to Sundance with a more modest effort that\u2019s still plenty weird in its own right.", "authors": ["Bilge Ebiri"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/18/sundance-films/death-of-dick-long.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
