The model, fitted for the first time with the brand\u2019s five-link Jubilee bracelet, carries an official price tag of $9,250\u2014but that\u2019s beside the point when you can\u2019t get your hands on one through normal retail channels. The watch went to the highest bidder for $22,000.\n\nStarved for supply, leading Rolex dealers around the world have been known to reward their biggest spenders with the opportunity to purchase one of the precious few they receive for the official list price. Otherwise, your dealer might offer to add your name to a yearslong waiting list\u2014or you might find the list is already closed.\n\nThis year, Rolex followed up with another version of the GMT-Master II with a \u201cBatman\u201d bezel in blue and black Cerachrom ceramic with similar results. Listed at $9,250, the watch is being offered by online resellers for more than double that price.\n\nGMT-Master II, along with Patek Philippe\u2019s Nautilus and Audemars Piguet\u2019s Royal Oak, currently form a veritable holy trinity of ultimate grail watches. For Aurel Bacs, senior consultant at Phillips in Association with Bacs & Russo and founder at Bacs & Russo, the seemingly insatiable demand is rooted in cultural shifts as the world\u2019s wealthiest A-listers and influencers adopt more casual lifestyles compared with their predecessors.\n\n\u201cIf you and I had foreseen, 10 to 20 years ago, that Yeezy, Supreme, and SUVs are going to be the lifestyle of wealthy and successful people, we could have concluded that Royal Oaks, GMTs, and Nautiluses would be hot in 2019,\u201d says Bacs, who draws a sharp contrast to 40 or 50 years ago, when the rich and famous wore impeccably tailored double-breasted suits, bespoke English shoes, and elegant ultraslim yellow gold dress watches.\n\nPatek Philippe Nautilus with annual calendar & moonphase Courtesy of Patek Philippe\n\n\u201cWhat do Yeezy, Supreme, Royal Oak, Nautilus, and GMT have in common other than being cool, dynamic, and modern?\u201d asks Bacs. \u201cThey are difficult to obtain, and people are ready to pay a premium for them on the secondary market, as much as in art with KAWS, Basquiat, and Koons.\u201d\n\nAnother factor is generational, he points out. Decades ago, wealthy patrons of luxury cars, watches, and art tended to be older, elder-statesmen types, whereas today\u2019s leading entrepreneurs trend younger, some even in their 20s and 30s. \u201cThe wealthy people have become younger,\u201d Bacs says, \u201cand younger people often want to leave their own marks and be different from their parents and grandparents.\u201d\n\n\u201c Don\u2019t think of what\u2019s fashionable. Go for the classics. \u201d \u2014Aurel Bacs\n\nHe also sees a yearning for nostalgia and handcraftsmanship among those who are surrounded by ever-more technically perfect products and gadgets. A mechanical watch may not be as accurate as your smartphone, but it possesses more soul and emotion. Also, consider that Gerald Genta designed the Royal Oak in 1972 and the Nautilus in 1976, and that GMT Master II traces its lineage back to the 1950s. The appeal of retro design isn\u2019t only fueling demand for vintage watches, but also for vintage cars, vintage Herm\u00e8s bags, vintage furniture, and even new interpretations of vintage designs. \u201cThis generation is trying to hold on to something from the generation before,\u201d he says.\n\nBacs says that for clients looking to invest in watches, classic is king. As proof, he lists Porsche\u2019s 911, Eames\u2019 lounge chair, and Herm\u00e8s\u2019 Kelly bag as things that are \u201cso good that they outlast generations and fashion trends.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think of what\u2019s fashionable. Fashion, by definition, is at one point in fashion and then out of fashion. Go for the classics,\u201d he says.\n\nRolex GMT-Master II in Oystersteel Courtesy of Rolex\n\nPaying attention to quality and rarity is also key to making a wise purchasing decision. The age-old law of supply and demand still rules, so avoid pieces that are ubiquitous. According to Bacs, the best investment to have when it comes time to sell is being able to say, \u201cYes, I may be asking a lot, but go and try to find another one.\u201d\n\nWith demand exploding and brands holding production levels steady, market values have been skyrocketing in recent years. Bacs compares the trajectory to the takeoff of a plane that rapidly accelerates and then slowly levels off at cruising altitude. \u201cWith Royal Oak, Nautilus, and GMT, we just went through the clouds,\u201d he says, underscoring that he doesn\u2019t see a peak reached just yet. \u201cThese three watches tick every box: timeless versus fashionable; they represent craftsmanship; and there is more demand than supply.\u201d\n\nStill, he does see some strong buying opportunities for those who are more focused on value. One suggestion is to look for less-popular variants within the model families. For example, he says, a 1980s yellow gold Royal Oak perpetual calendar is going for about $30,000, which is less than a time-only version selling for about $35,000. As a bonus, you get more watch for the buck.\n\nSimilarly, he says, two-tone GMT-Masters from the 1970s in stainless steel and gold are available for $6,000 to $10,000 less than the all-steel models from the same period. So, once again, you can pay less for a watch that originally cost more. Or, look outside these collections completely and consider similar models, such as an IWC Ingenieur SL Reference 1832, designed by Genta in 1976. According to Bacs, that model can be had for less than $15,000, a fraction of what you might pay for a Royal Oak or Nautilus, which go for $50,000 to $100,000.\n\nAnother path is to look at independent producers that are lesser known but still in demand among the cognoscenti. \u201cI recommend taking a closer look at the independents,\u201d Bacs says. \u201cThe kings of the independents are Philippe Dufour and George Daniels, selling for countless multiples of their retails. But limited editions by MB&F, Richard Mille, and F.P. Journe are also very much in demand because they tick the aforementioned boxes.\u201d\n\nWithout a crystal ball, it\u2019s hard to project which will be the must-have watches in 10 to 20 years. Will there be a backlash to the ubercasual trend, with people looking to emulate the elegant likes of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn? Or will street style be taken to the extreme? Only time will tell.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake watch buyers make is buying only with future profits in mind, and completely ignoring that the first reason they should buy a nice watch is for their own pleasure,\u201d Bacs says. \u201cIf you want to invest money, go to Wall Street.\u201d\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "Watch guru Aurel Bacs on collectibles from Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Audemars Piguet", "authors": ["Laurie Kahle", "Aurel Bacs"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-101367/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
