Boat Fire\n\nThe former resident contacted a current homeowner living in Moon Bay Circle, who used a drone to confirm it was a white car on the edge of the pond behind his house.\n\nThe man called the sheriff's office on Aug. 28, and deputies later arrived to find the white sedan's exterior \"heavily calcified.\" After they got the car out, they found the skeletal remains inside.\n\nPossible serial killer? Man charged in 31-year-old cold case murder. Police suspect he may have killed others\n\nThe vehicle was towed to the Medical Examiner's Office for processing, where the remains were positively identified as Moldt.\n\nThe National Missing and Unidentified Persons System says Moldt went to a nightclub in November 1997 but did not appear intoxicated as he left alone before midnight and was \"not a frequent drinker.\" He had called his girlfriend from the club saying he would return to their Lantana home soon.\n\nThe Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office told the BBC that officials presume Moldt lost control of his car and crashed into the pond. Authorities have notified the family of the discovery of his remains, the news organization reported.\n\nAccording to The Charley Project, an online database of cold cases in the U.S., a satellite image of the sunken car had been visible on Google Earth since 2007.\n\nCold case solved: Terri Lynn Hollis, 11, was murdered on Thanksgiving Day 1972. California investigators didn't give up on her case\n\nThe subdivision was under construction when Moldt disappeared, but the pond was already there. Barry Fay, whose home is near where the car was found, told The Palm Beach Post that he had never noticed anything from the shoreline.\n\n\"Never did I believe there would be a 22-year-old dead body,\" Fay told the newspaper.\n\nContributing: Associated Press.
