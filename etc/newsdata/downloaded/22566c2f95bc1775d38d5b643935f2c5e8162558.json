The figure includes 5,000 prisoners who fell victim to a typhus epidemic due to being denied access to food, water and medication as well as catastrophic hygiene conditions, 200 people who were gassed with Zyklon B and 30 people executed with a device specially built for killing with a shot in the neck.\n\nBy stopping prisoners from escaping, prosecutors argue the guards played a crucial role in allowing mass killings to take place at Stutthof, where an estimated 65,000 people perished before 9 May 1945, when the camp was liberated by allied forces.\n\nThe accused guard has cooperated with the investigators by allowing himself to be interviewed eight times. A doctor has declared him mentally fit for a trial, but each court session has been scheduled to last no more than two hours.\n\nIn one of the interviews, Bruno D reportedly confessed to having heard screams, and being aware of the nature of killings at the time. \u201cI probably knew that these were Jews who hadn\u2019t committed a crime, that they were only in here because they were Jews,\u201d he said, according to Die Welt newspaper. \u201cAnd they have a right to live and work freely like every other human being.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, he reportedly does not believe he is guilty of being an accessory to murder. \u201cWhat use would it have been if I had left, they would have found someone else?\u201d Die Welt quoted him as saying.\n\nThe prosecution disagrees, arguing that especially by late 1944 it would have been possible for him to fight on the eastern front instead of serving as a guard. Bruno D claims to have been unable to go into battle because of a heart condition.\n\nStutthof, one of the smaller of the Nazi concentration camps, was originally set up to detain members of the Polish political leadership and intelligentsia, but was from 1944 increasingly used to hold and kill Jews transferred from the Baltic states, Hungary and the Auschwitz concentration camp. By the end of 1944, 70% of Stutthof\u2019s population was Jewish.\n\nThe Hamburg trial has about 20 co-plaintiffs who spent time at Stutthof, of which four are former members of the Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the dominant resistance movement in Poland, and two are women who fought in the Warsaw uprising. Witnesses will fly in from America, Israel and Poland to give testimony in front of the court from the end of October.\n\nEven though none of the witnesses are likely to remember Bruno D, the trial has a high symbolic value for many of the victims. \u201cThis is not a matter of revenge,\u201d said Markus Horstmann, a lawyer representing one of the co-plaintiffs. \u201cA trial like this is for them more about seeing what happened to them declared an injustice in a German court, and about telling their story so it doesn\u2019t get forgotten,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\nGermany\u2019s criminal justice system has allowed a number of cases against concentration camp personnel such as that in Hamburg since the 2011 landmark sentencing of John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian prisoner who became a \u201cforeign helper\u201d to the Nazis after his capture in 1942.\n\nThe trial against Demjanjuk ruled that someone could be sentenced for being a cog in the Nazi killing machine even if the prosecution could not link the accused to individual murders.\n\nSince then, the Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, in Ludwigsburg, near Stuttgart, has been sifting through historical records in search of further cases to bring to trial. Bruno D came on to the radar of the centre\u2019s researchers after they found his name in the archives of the Stutthof camp\u2019s museum.\n\nWhile prosecutors across Germany are carrying out preliminary investigations into a further 23 similar cases of Nazi crimes, the chances of these ending up in a court are rapidly decreasing with the passage of time, as the remaining suspects are all of extremely old age.\n\n\u201cWe are continuously moving closer to the last trial of this kind,\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian.\n\nBecause Bruno D was 17 at the time of the alleged crimes, he will appear in front of a youth court, with the judge having to balance the severity of the crimes committed with German criminal law for young offenders, which has a maximum sentence of 10 years.", "description": "Man, 93, accused as accessory to murder of 5,230 people in what could be one of last such cases", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5f823b7fb442b202c2052e2df9e6fadbd2d7957/0_71_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b7a2046cf3c572727e0e5cbbf01a34f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
