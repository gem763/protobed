Over the next 94 years, The Times was balanced, endorsing 12 Republican presidential candidates (including its first six) and 12 Democratic presidential candidates (along with one candidate from the Bourbon Democrats).\n\nSince 1960, though \u2014 the last 15 elections \u2014 the paper has endorsed only Democrats (its win-loss record: 7-8).\n\nDuring those last 60 years, the paper has become more openly liberal. Its op-ed page is, of course, hardcore left. But that bias has been creeping into the news pages for years, with reporters and editors twisting facts and spinning the news to fits its leftward lean, often in support of Democrats.\n\nBut everything changed Sunday. On Sept. 15, 2019, The New York Times became a dangerous tool of misinformation controlled by the left, one that simply can no longer be trusted on any story.\n\nOn that day, the paper put out a \u201cbombshell\u201d headlined: \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not.\u201d The story was all about Deborah Ramirez\u2019s experience at Yale University, where she met the future Supreme Court justice. Years later, in an attempt to derail his nomination to the Supreme Court, she would claim he thrust his penis in her face at a dorm party when they were both students.\n\nThe story \u2014 written by two Times reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, and adapted from their forthcoming anti-Kavanaugh book \u2014 contained this: \u201cWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\nWell. Quite an accusation.\n\nBut there was a problem. A big problem.\n\nMollie Hemingway, a senior editor at The Federalist, got an advance copy of the book. She tweeted, \u201cThe book notes, quietly, that the woman Max Stier named as having been supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh and friends denies any memory of the alleged event. Seems, I don\u2019t know, significant.\u201d\n\nIndeed it is.\n\nThe story gets very ugly from here.\n\nThe Times put out an \u201cEditor\u2019s note\u201d (not a correction, mind you).\n\n\u201cThe book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article,\u201d the note said.\n\nHere\u2019s why what The Times did Sunday is far worse than what they normally do. It\u2019s one thing to spin facts and twist context to make a case (both sides do that). But omitting a fact that kills your entire story is an entirely different thing.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an accident. That detail \u2014 the fact that friends of the alleged victim told the book authors that she doesn\u2019t remember a thing about the alleged incident \u2014 was contained later in the book, which was written by the same people who wrote the article. They knew that they were lying by omission and they did it anyway.\n\nMore. The editors of the piece, who (duh) should have read the book by then, knew that, too. They all knew that the piece would hit social media hard and trend heavily, (it did, with the headline, \u201cNYT reporters\u2019 book details new sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh\u201d).\n\nEven more. The authors on Tuesday said they had included the important information but claimed an editor took it out. And yet they let the story run, saying nothing to anyone until they were found out.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: The New York Times deliberately withheld information that shot holes in their salacious story. The authors knew it, the editors knew it, and yet they did it anyway. The goal \u2014 take down a Supreme Court justice, an effort that failed the last time they tried.\n\nSo deep is the hatred for President Trump that a once-great newspaper is now sinking so low as to omit key facts just to damage the president. The Times now is publishing unverified gossip under the guise of news reporting, and even omitting facts that unravel its flimsy \u201cbombshell.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019 motto, tucked in the upper left ear of the print edition for the last 115 years, reads \u201cAll The News That\u2019s Fit To Print.\u201d But after what they did Sept. 15, 2019, they should change that to \u201cIf You\u2019re Looking For Facts, You Won\u2019t Find Them Here.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times is dead. And that ain\u2019t fake news.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
