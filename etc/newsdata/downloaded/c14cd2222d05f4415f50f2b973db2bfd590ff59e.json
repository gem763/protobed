His efforts failed and Leonardo had to use another model to satisfy her husband\u2019s requests. The investigative team compared Salai\u2019s features from other Leonardo paintings to those of the Mona Lisa.\n\n\u201cWe have used all the paintings in which Leonardo used Salai as a model and compared them to the Mona Lisa and certain details correspond perfectly,\u201d says Silvano Vinceti. \u201cSo, he used two models and then added creative details, that came from his own imagination. I believe that this goes with a long-time fascination of Leonardo\u2019s, which was the subject of androgyny. In other words, for Leonardo, the perfect person was a combination of a man and a woman.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s believed to be the remains of Lisa Gherardini were discovered last year by researchers excavating under a centuries-old convent in Florence. The bones, which included a femur, are believed to date back to around the time she died, in July 1542, at the age of 63.", "description": "An Italian art detective claims that Leonardo da Vinci used both a female and a male model to create the face of one of the world\u2019s most famous", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/331597/1000x563_331597.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-02"}
