There are strip lights and mess and a very large actress who utters groundbreaking insights into obesity along the lines of, \u2018I\u2019m only fat because I\u2019m poor\u2019. She officiates at the wedding of Blanchett, who is clearly insane, to Dillane, who plays a part I can only describe as cantankerous old git.\n\nThere is no plot to speak of. The couple argue all the time \u2013 in the lead-up to the wedding, in the front seats of the car. We can only suppose that Blanchett has suggested he consult a map.\n\nEarly on, Dillane gratuitously attacks her with a scalpel, bloodying her face. He smacks her exposed rump. She retaliates by strutting around in a corset, displaying a Pilates-honed body only native to Beverly Hills.\n\nShe has been lauded as \u2018brave\u2019 for portraying messy sex and violence; I\u2019d say she\u2019s spent so many years strutting her stuff on the red carpet, she\u2019s brainwashed.\n\nThere is a nod to modern times when the actors swap genders. But this can\u2019t disguise the fact we\u2019re in thrall to Neanderthal values. Blanchett actually utters the line: \u2018I\u2019d rather be raped than bored.\u2019\n\nHer part is curiously weak, too: unlike Liz Taylor, who gives as good as she gets to Richard Burton or Paul Newman, Blanchett capitulates quickly and is seen to crawl on the floor when told to do so. If I wanted to see a supplicant, I\u2019d pop down the road to Stringfellows. No one in the audience gasps or faints. Only one woman walks out, quite early on. She doesn\u2019t seem upset, she\u2019s probably just realised it\u2019s two hours long, with no interval, and that she has a hungry cat. That\u2019s how tedious it is.\n\nThere is only one sharp line. The Man is telling a long anecdote about how he bought a punnet of cherries. The couple argue. He says: \u2018I thought you found talking attractive.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 she shoots back, \u2018but then you go on talking.\u2019\n\nThe National Theatre has sent an email to ticket holders warning them about the show\n\nThe only thing I learn is that women and men are equally ghastly. That we push each other\u2019s buttons and don\u2019t know when to stop. Blanchett is mesmerising: her face is all angles, she delivers lines like bullets, but even so I feel betrayed.\n\nThere is no tension, no surprise. I long for Noel Coward\u2019s repressed dialogue in Brief Encounter \u2013 that\u2019s a part I\u2019d love Blanchett to inhabit.\n\nIt\u2019s very hard to infer, so easy to shock and I expect more from the National. This play manages to be both nasty and comical: in the final scene, Blanchett gets hold of a sex toy, straps it on, and proceeds to have sex with her co-star as his trousers and the curtain drop, causing much tittering.\n\nThere is no standing ovation, but also no boos.\n\nI wonder if I\u2019m the philistine, so I corner theatre-goers afterwards. A woman from Brixton tells me: \u2018I think I need the weekend to process it.\u2019 When I ask what the play is trying to say, another tells me: \u2018I will have to think about that.\u2019\n\nMelissa Favors-Oliver, 19, from New Jersey, says: \u2018I was expecting it to be way more controversial because of what we\u2019ve read\u2026 I was expecting to be more shocked.\u2019\n\nFar from \u2018Crowd passes out at orgy\u2019, as Friday\u2019s headlines proclaimed, the women I speak to want to be more challenged because, frankly, we\u2019ve seen it all before.\n\n'When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other' is based on Samuel Richardson\u2019s novel, Pamela\n\nThis play doesn\u2019t explore new ground, or explain old ground. We see the female star\u2019s buttocks, but the male actor here retains his dignity throughout.\n\nElissa, a soignee audience member, tells me: \u2018I think it\u2019s very anti-women. I wasn\u2019t expecting that \u2013 it\u2019s a big mistake. I\u2019d have walked out had I not been seated at the front.\u2019\n\nBlanchett said in a recent interview she is aware \u2018some people might be enraged, some perplexed, some people excited\u2019.\n\nOnly the second of those three ambitions is achieved.\n\nYou know what I find shocking? The fact the young actor, Samuel Tucker, the one who assisted the fainting woman, explains the play thus: \u2018For all women out there [Blanchett is saying] even when you are 49 you can\u2026 be all-powerful and sexy.\u2019\n\nIs that what it\u2019s about? And if it is, then WOMEN ALREADY KNOW THIS! We don\u2019t need to spend 50 quid to find this out.\n\nWhat planet are these intellectuals on, believing they\u2019re giving us something \u2018avant-garde\u2019, when all they are really doing is pandering to the idea that unless you\u2019re 20, you cannot possibly enjoy sex, and that you\u2019re no longer attractive, even if you look like Cate Blanchett.", "description": "LIZ JONES: I quickly realised the play, being staged at the National\u2019s tiny Dorfman Theatre, should really be called When We Have Sufficiently Tortured The Poor Audience.", "authors": ["Liz Jones Column For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/19/22/8741002-0-image-a-4_1547937908605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-19"}
