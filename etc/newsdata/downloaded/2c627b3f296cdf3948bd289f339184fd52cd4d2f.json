He reportedly retained a 20 percent stake in the company when he sold it to Harber.\n\nHer company bought the two properties with the intention of creating a tourist attraction, but it closed within three years and went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy shortly after.\n\nLas Vegas-based Smoketree LLC, which bought the massive space, is likely walking away from the sale singing \u201cDanke Schoen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Realtor.com, after a month on the market with an asking price of $70 million, the price was cut to $48 million. By 2014, the price hit $30 million.\n\nHis family sold the property in 2010 amid bankruptcy for $19.5 million.\n\nRecords show the property was built in 1952.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The 36-acre ranch first hit the market at $70M.
