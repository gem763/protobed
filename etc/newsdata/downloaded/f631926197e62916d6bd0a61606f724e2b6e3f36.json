That attorney, who previously represented President Donald Trump, accused congressional investigators of trying to harass and intimidate the two men in a letter that The Daily Beast obtained. The men\u2014Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman\u2014had tried to help Giuliani investigate Hunter Biden, a project at the core of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees had set an October 7 deadline for Parnas and Fruman to voluntarily turn over records related to their activities with Giuiliani. \u201cYour request for documents and communications is overly broad and unduly burdensome,\u201d wrote their attorney, John Dowd. \u201cThe subject matter of your requests is well beyond the scope of your inquiry. This, in combination with requiring immediate responses, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the Democratic Committee members\u2019 intent is to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.\u201d\n\nDowd said \u201cThe \u2018Committees\u2019\u201d\u2014in scare quotes\u2014violated their standard procedures by asking the two men to turn over documents within seven days and testify within 15.\n\n\u201cConsidering the important factual questions and legal issues attendant to the alleged whistleblower, your investigation, your authority and requests for information, your charter should be amended to exhibit some semblance of due process, fairness, justice and common decency,\u201d Dowd\u2019s letter concluded.\n\nParnas and Fruman, two Soviet-born Floridians, have connected Giuliani to various Ukrainian officials, including the ex-prosecutor who Trump and Giuliani claim was fired at Biden\u2019s behest to protect his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Parnas and Fruman also worked to orchestrate political changes in Ukraine that might help their nascent natural gas company, Global Energy Producers LLC. With Giuliani\u2019s assistance, the two men successfully pressed for the ouster of America\u2019s ambassador to Kiev, Marie Yovanovitch, and, the AP reported on Sunday, advanced efforts to overhaul leadership at Ukraine\u2019s national oil and gas company, Naftogaz.\n\nHouse Dems Preparing Investigation of Rudy Giuliani for Ukraine Shenanigans\n\nCongressional Democrats asked Parnass and Fruman for documents on Sept. 30. They also subpoenaed Giuliani that same day for documents. Giuliani told The Daily Beast he has not decided whether or not to comply.\n\n\u201cI have a real question about whether I should recognize their legitimacy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they are totally illegitimate... I\u2019m going to go in front of a committee with a chairman who is a liar.\u201d\n\nGoing on offense against congressional investigators is a central part of the strategy that Trump\u2019s allies are using to defend him. Chairman Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee has become their top foe. And the president himself has also lambasted the California Democrat, calling him \u201cShifty Schiff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven't made up my mind,\u201d Giuliani continued, \u201cbut one of the issues is, do you acknowledge an illicit committee?\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have already stiff-armed the Hill. Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo missed a deadline to turn over documents that Congress had subpoenaed. But members of Congress will still get face time with him soon; on October 15, he\u2019s scheduled to meet behind closed doors with members and staff of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to discuss refugee caps. State Department officials have told Congress that Pompeo plans to be at the meeting, according to two sources familiar with the communications.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
