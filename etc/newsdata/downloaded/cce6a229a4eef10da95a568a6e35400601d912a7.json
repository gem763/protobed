An outrage. Now more than ever, by your side and those of your families. It is time to react as never before,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe 12 defendants, most of them members of the former Catalan government, were put on trial in February for their role in the banned October 1, 2017 referendum and the short-lived independence declaration that followed it.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court condemns Oriol Junqueras to 13 years of prison\u2026 on grounds of sedition and the misuse of public funds,\u201d the judges wrote in their ruling.\n\nIn Puigdemont\u2019s absence, Junqueras served as the main defendant.\n\nIn a letter to his supporters released on Monday, Junqueras said the story was far from over.\n\n\u201cTo those who are only driven by the will to do harm, we say to them that nothing ends today, you neither win nor convince,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe will come back even stronger\u2026 and win.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Separatists denounce ruling \u2013\n\nFormer parliamentary speaker Carme Forcadell was handed 11 years and six months in prison, while five other former ministers in the Catalan government were jailed for between 10 years and six months and 12 years.\n\nTwo influential Catalan civic leaders, Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Cuixart, were also sentenced to nine years in prison, while the remaining three leaders, who faced lesser charges, escaped jail time and were each handed a 60,000-euro ($70,000) fine.\n\nThe government is hoping the long-awaited ruling will allow it to turn the page on the crisis in the wealthy northeastern region where support for independence had been gaining momentum over the past decade.\n\nThe separatist movement hopes for just the opposite \u2014 that the guilty verdicts will unite their divided ranks and bring supporters onto the streets.\n\n\u2013 Activists gear up to protest \u2013\n\nActivists from the region\u2019s two biggest grassroots pro-independence groups, the Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, have urged followers to rally in the evening.\n\nIn the coming days, demonstrators will march from five towns towards Barcelona where they will congregate on Friday, when a general strike has been called.\n\nActivists from the radical CDR (Committees for the Defence of the Republic), have also promised \u201csurprises\u201d. On Sunday they briefly occupied the main train station in Barcelona before cutting traffic on a main avenue of the city.\n\nAnti-riot police have been discreetly deployed to Catalonia but the interior ministry has refused to give numbers.\n\nFor many, the situation has brought back memories of tensions in the street in the run-up to the October 1, 2017 referendum which was marred by police violence, and ahead of the short-lived independence declaration that followed on October 27.\n\nIn recent weeks, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has made it clear that his government will not tolerate any violence, warning he will not hesitate to renew a suspension of Catalan autonomy, as happened two years ago.\n\nThe situation is worrying the main Catalan business lobby which said although the verdict would have a \u201csignificant emotional impact\u201d, it was important the response avoided disrupting \u201cbusiness activity or social cohesion\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Sedition not rebellion \u2013\n\nBy definition, the most serious charge of rebellion is \u201crising up in a violent and public manner\u201d to, among other things, \u201cdeclare independence for part of the (Spanish) territory\u201d.\n\nSedition, however, is \u201crising up publicly and in turbulent fashion\u201d to \u201cprevent by force or in an illegal way\u201d the law from being applied, or the application of an administrative or legal decision.\n\nThe trial comes just weeks before Spain heads to the polls for its fourth election in as many years, putting the Catalan question once more at the centre of the political debate.\n\nAlthough Sanchez\u2019s government is hoping the trial\u2019s end might give fresh impetus to dialogue, Junqueras\u2019 leftwing ERC party has said it would not be possible without an \u201camnesty\u201d for \u201cpolitical prisoners and those in exile\u201d.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Spain\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to prison terms of between nine and 13 years for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/38e5d4_situation-has-brought-memories-run-up-referendum-2017-spain-jails-catalan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
