On the former song, Gomez muses, \"In two months, you replaced us / Like it was easy / Made me think I deserved it / In the thick of healing.\" (Bieber became engaged to Hailey Baldwin in summer 2018, a mere few months after ending his relationship with Gomez for good.) The latter song, meanwhile, speaks in generalities but illustrates the process of finding yourself again after enduring a breakup. \"Of course she was sad / But now she's glad she dodged a bullet,\" she sings.\n\nGomez, for her part, hasn't mentioned Bieber or Baldwin by name in recent interviews about the new music. But in an interview on Friday (October 25), the singer said she hopes that her ex has heard her new tracks.\n\nIn an appearance on the Zach Sang Show, Gomez was asked whether she wants the \"individual\" she wrote her songs about (i.e., one Justin Bieber) to listen to them one day. Her answer was direct: \"Yeah. I do,\" she said.\n\nHer hope isn't coming from a malicious place, she added. \"For me, my intentions are never evil. They just aren\u2019t. I don\u2019t even know how to do that.\" She continued, \"I can be a bit snappy but I always want to come from a place that\u2019s genuine, and when I feel like some things haven\u2019t been said then I get to turn that into art.\"\n\nWe'll probably never know for sure the situations behind the songs\u2060, but regardless, Bieber and Baldwin don't seem to be sweating the chatter.\n\n\"Of course Justin and Hailey have heard Selena's new song and they are both trying to not give any reaction to her lyrics referencing Justin,\" a source revealed to E! News. \"It isn't ideal for Hailey, but she understands the creative process of writing music and that Justin had a past.\"\n\nThe source continues, \"Justin has completely moved on from that chapter of his life and understands that Selena is allowed to reflect on the past in her own way. Justin and Hailey both want Selena to be happy and in a good place and aren't phased by it.\"\n\nThis is certainly in line with how Baldwin reacted to fans thinking she shaded Gomez on Instagram after the new music dropped. The model posted a screen shot of the Summer Walker song \"I'll Kill You\" to her IG Story the same day Gomez released \"Lose You to Love Me,\" which, of course, fans read into. But Baldwin shut this down quickly. \u201cPlease stop with this nonsense. There is no \u2018response.\u2019 This is complete BS,\" she wrote in a now deleted comment.\n\nGomez also seemingly addressed this drama on Instagram Live. \"I am so grateful for the response of the song. However, I will never stand for women tearing other women down,\" she said. \"So please be kind to everyone.\"\n\nOriginally Appeared on Glamour\n\n", "description": "Gomez said she wants Bieber to hear the tracks.", "authors": ["Christopher Rosa"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_fyPIFzG5MFAF7qSEMSc.w--~B/aD0zMzcxO3c9NDg4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/ebe73655655fb420fee5fe76fdd7cd44", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
