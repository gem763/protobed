When he said he had an address only on the northern island of Hokkaido, he was told to leave, the newspaper reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe man said he spent the night under a plastic umbrella beneath the eaves of a building, according to the paper. Another homeless man was denied entry to the same shelter that afternoon, although other shelters in the city were reported to have allowed in the homeless.\n\nAD\n\nAbe told parliament on Tuesday that the homeless men should have been given refuge, and he promised to take action to prevent similar cases in future.\n\n\u201cShelters are supposed to be set up for the purpose of protecting lives of affected people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is desirable to accept all affected people in shelters.\u201d\n\nThe news provoked strong debate on social media, although, as the BBC noted, not all of it was sympathetic. Some feared that this would damage the international image of Japan as it prepares to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, but others asked whether residents would want to share their shelters with \u201csmelly\u201d or \u201cmentally ill\u201d homeless people.\n\nAD\n\nJapan has dispatched 110,000 troops, police, coast guard members and firefighters to help with the rescue efforts, as the death toll from one of the worst storms in decades rose on Tuesday. The government said at least 10 people were missing. Some areas were still inaccessible because of high water levels, according to the Japan Times.\n\nAD\n\nAbout 30,000 homes remain without power, and 128,000 are without water, while a total of 146 mudslides were reported nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe national government will continue to do everything possible so that the victims of this disaster can return to their normal lives as soon as possible,\u201d Abe said.\n\nAnother homeless man was found dead Tuesday near a flooded river in another part of the capital. Government figures show that Tokyo has about 1,100 homeless people, although the real figure may be higher, an official told the Agence France-Presse news agency.\n\nAD", "description": "The death toll has risen to 69, with 10 still missing, in one of the worst storms in decades.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pyIWwa3CpqH-YXZ7r6HXVanOaG0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MQXR4HXN5AI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
