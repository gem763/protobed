Buzz60\u2019s Tony Spitz has the details. Buzz60\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 Oksana Chusovitina's age isn\u2019t her problem. Another number is.\n\nThe 44-year-old gymnast will have to wait until Saturday night to see if her all-around score will be good enough to get her a spot in the Tokyo Olympics. The top 20 women from countries that did not qualify a full team for the 2020 Games earn spots, and Chusovitina\u2019s score of 48.433 doesn\u2019t even have her in the top 10 with eight qualifying sessions left.\n\n\u201cI will try not to be nervous,\u201d she said through a translator Friday. \u201cI will try to distract myself because I\u2019ve already competed and everyone prepared how they prepared. For the next 24 hours, I will maybe go take a walk. I will not watch the competition and will not think about it.\n\nOksana Chusovitina, shown at the 2016 Olympics, is trying to qualify for next year's Game in Tokyo at age 44.

The sport prizes the flexibility and fearlessness of youth, and most gymnasts at these world championships are still teenagers. Not only is Chusovitina nearly three times their age, her 19-year-old son is older than some of them.\n\nUS TEAM: MyKayla Skinner is left out of lineup at worlds\n\nHer first world championships was in 1991, so long ago that the daughter of one of her teammates on that Soviet squad has competed, won the Olympic all-around title and retired \u2013 nearly a decade ago.\n\nYet Chusovitina is not some aging diva who simply can\u2019t let go. She loves gymnastics, her body has held up and she\u2019s still competitive. She made the vault finals at last year\u2019s world championships and just missed being on the podium, finishing fourth.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t she keep going?\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how old you are, it matters what you do,\u201d Chusovitina said. \u201cI just do it because this is what I love. And I always say if you do something, put your soul and your heart into it.\u201d\n\nTokyo would be the eighth consecutive Olympics for Chusovitina, who won a gold medal with the Soviet team in 1992 and a silver on vault 12 years later.\n\nShe had hoped to lock up a spot for Tokyo in one of two ways at these world championships: with one of those all-around spots or as one of the top vaulters. But she botched the landing of her second vault and had to put a hand down, a major deduction.\n\nThen, on balance beam, she lost her footing during a flight series and had to jump off.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it,\u201d she said of whether she should have watered down her vault. \u201cI made a mistake and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nChusovitina could still end up in Tokyo if she doesn\u2019t qualify here. But the methods are far more complicated and not necessarily within her control.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s think positive thoughts.\u201d", "description": "Uzbekistan gymnast Oksana Chusovitina is trying to lock up a spot in her eighth consecutive Olympics at the age of 44.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published A.M.
