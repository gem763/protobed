He did not graduate from college or hold a position of power. On his employer\u2019s website, he is listed as a \u201ccustodian/bus driver.\u201d\n\nBut if you sat in the Washington National Cathedral on Monday night, you would have seen it fill with people who came for his memorial service and who saw the stately setting as a fitting place for it. You would have heard people describe a man who was rare in his kindness and who spent most of his life working in or near the iconic building.\n\nYou would have seen the grief on the faces of teenagers and women he literally cheered on.\n\nMagoba was in high school when he first started cleaning the Cathedral, and at 18, he took a job at the nearby all-girls National Cathedral School. He worked there for 47 years, until his death on Aug. 4.\n\n\u201cAs he often mentioned when he was reminiscing, Edward was terrified of the girls at first, afraid to say much or give a fist bump or a high five, or whatever the equivalent was back at that time,\u201d Becky Rivera told the crowd at his service. She first met Magoba when her daughter attended the school and later worked with him. \u201cBut over time, and as many of you in this Cathedral experienced firsthand, he became your biggest fan and your guardian angel.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdward Magoba, who worked for the National Cathedral School for 47 years before his death in August, was beloved by many of the school\u2019s past and current students. (National Cathedral School)\n\nShe described how he drove students on the bus to their athletic competitions and then stood on the sidelines, cheering loudly for them. You can do it, girls! And how sometimes, if opposing teams didn\u2019t have many fans, he took on that role, too.\n\n\u201cMr. Magoba was the most selfless and giving individual many of us have ever known,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cEdward was unique in his ability to absorb and reflect the happiness around him, no matter his own circumstances, and that continued until the very end.\u201d\n\nMagoba, who was married and had a stepson, died at the age of 65, after a five-year battle with prostate cancer. Before his death, he received thousands of letters from former and current students, their parents and his co-workers.\n\nHeather Dent, the school\u2019s athletic director, read many of those letters to him. She told those gathered at the service that their words made a difference in his life. She also confessed that she hadn\u2019t written him a letter before sharing what hers would have said.\n\n\u201cDear Ed, I miss you,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to know that I carry you with me each day, and I promise to pass on your legacy of kindness and love. I want you to know that kindness counted, and you made a difference in people\u2019s lives, especially mine. You knew all of us. When we felt no one saw us, you called us by name and shared in our stories by saying hello and asking how we were doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never told you in person,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I believe you are and will be the best teacher that National Cathedral School will ever have. You helped so many generations of women feel seen, feel supported and feel loved.\u201d\n\nAfter his death, she slipped his ID badge behind hers and now carries both with her every day. She shared that detail with me when we spoke the day after the service about how Magoba came to loom so large in the lives of so many people who have passed through the school in the past four decades.\n\nFor the service, alumni came from near and far, and the event was streamed live on YouTube for those who couldn\u2019t make it. Online, people have left comments about him that read, \u201cI love him so much\u201d and \u201cEd, you are amongst my favorite memories of NCS.\u201d\n\nThe field hockey team recently put an image of a ribbon wrapped around his name on their hockey sticks. Before that, the crew team put his name on the side of a boat. Dent said she expects other teams will also create tributes to him as their seasons begin and \u201cthey start to feel the emptiness\u201d of his absence.\n\n\n\nEdward Magoba, center, often drove student athletes to their competitions and then cheered from the sidelines. (National Cathedral School)\n\nThe closeness Magoba achieved with students is striking, even without knowing much about him. It\u2019s even more so when you consider how distant his life started from many of theirs.\n\nHe spent his early childhood in Uganda. His family moved to the District because of his father\u2019s job as an educational attache for the Ugandan government. But when it came time for the family to return, Edward did not join his parents and siblings.\n\nMaria Walker recalled how his father, Joseph Magoba, asked her late husband, Bishop John T. Walker, if his son could stay with them until he finished high school. At the time, the couple had a 2 year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son.\n\n\u201cHe just sort of became a part of our family,\u201d Walker said. Even as a teenager, she recalled, he was \u201cgentle\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d and, despite the distance between him and his relatives, he never sulked about his situation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s another person on earth who was like Edward,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people complain about this and complain about that, or ask \u2018Why did this happen to me?\u2019 But Edward did not. He was just resilient and able to navigate life.\u201d\n\nWhile attending Wilson High School, he worked at a Hot Shoppe restaurant but he wasn\u2019t happy and the hours ran too late, she said. So, he started working at the Cathedral, doing custodial work after school. Then, he saw that the girls school had an opening and applied for it.\n\n\u201cHe loved working with the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he saw that as his calling.\u201d\n\n\n\nThree young relatives of Edward Magoba \u2014 Milani Senkeeto, Zion Atkins and Joseph Magoba \u2014 watch performers outside Washington National Cathedral following his memorial service on Sept. 16. (Theresa Vargas/The Washington Post)\n\nJohn Magoba, who now lives in Maryland, said when his older brother first decided to stay in the District, he missed him. At the same time, he knew his brother was thinking about him because every once in a while, a package would arrive, containing money or clothes.\n\nHe recalled how when his brother first came as an adult to visit Uganda, he handed out $100 bills, until a cousin told him he shouldn\u2019t do that. The next time he visited, he squeezed people\u2019s hands and discretely left money in their palms.\n\nAt the school, people swapped similar stories about his generosity. Once, he saw a woman on the bus without a coat and gave her money to buy one. Another time, he went to McDonald\u2019s with a co-worker and before they could walk in the door, he gave his meal money to someone outside.\n\n\u201cEdward comes from a long line of very giving people,\u201d John Magoba told the crowd at the Cathedral. He mentioned their grandfather, their father and Bishop Walker. \u201cSo he had a lot of teachers that told him humility is what the world is all about. My father gave us three things to live by that you can do in your life: You can fade away, and nobody knows you existed. You can do something so bad that you\u2019re not forgotten. Or you can do something good, and you will always be remembered. And I know that my brother will always be remembered.\u201d\n\nHis family held an earlier funeral that packed a church in Silver Spring. But the significance of seeing his brother honored at Washington National Cathedral was not lost on John Magoba. He was given the seat normally reserved for presidents.\n\n\u201cI was sitting where presidents have sat,\u201d he marveled after the service. He ticked off the names Obama, Trump, Bush. \u201cIt makes me feel like my brother is right up there.\u201d", "description": "Edward Magoba became a champion for teenage girls at the National Cathedral School, where he worked as a custodian and driver.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities.", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aBpY_spNbmIPvvd6Ho5N4QnCGKs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TCEVI5WZLAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
