More details coming soon. Stay tuned.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore soon\u201d and \u201cstay tuned\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Kik had been embroiled in a costly legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its initial coin offering\u2019s designation, with the regulator suing the company for having conducted an allegedly unregistered $100 million token offering.\n\nHaving pared down its workforce from 151 to just 19 and mulled a complete shutdown \u2014 according to a blog post from CEO Ted Livingston late last month \u2014 the company closed the Kik X beta platform on Sept. 27.\n\nYet the first hint of a turn in fortunes emerged on Oct. 7, when Livingston tweeted:\n\n\u201cSome exciting news: we may have found a home for Kik! We just signed an LOI [letter of intention] with a great company. They want to buy the app, continue growing it for our millions of users, and take the Kin integration to the next level. Not a done deal yet, but could be a great win win. More soon\u201d\n\nDown to the bone\n\nWith further details of the game-changing deal still to be announced, Kik\u2019s apparent decision to close had meanwhile been harshly criticized among community members. The Kin cryptocurrency has also seen a steady decline \u2014 no doubt in part due to broader market conditions, yet unlikely helped by the company\u2019s seemingly intractable difficulties.\n\nKin token 3-month chart, as of Oct. 14, 2019.
