Settlements with bond insurers and bondholders resulted in a 26% reduction in value.\n\nDetroit\u2019s first post-bankruptcy sale of GO bonds solely under its junk-rated credit in December 2018 found investors eager to snap up fat yields.\n\nDavid Massaron, Detroit\u2019s chief financial officer, said the new unlimited-tax GO bonds would be paid off within the city\u2019s existing property tax levy.\n\n\u201cI think the city has, A., proven that the investor community is comfortable with this credit, and B., has shown through its actions over the last several budgets that it is acting in a prudent and fiscally sound way,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\nMichigan\u2019s largest city was able to terminate active post-bankruptcy oversight of its finances in April 2018 after concluding three-straight fiscal years with balanced budgets.", "description": "Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan unveiled a plan on Monday to sell up to $250 million of bonds to tackle the city's remaining blighted and abandoned houses over the next five years.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430601564&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1PY", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
