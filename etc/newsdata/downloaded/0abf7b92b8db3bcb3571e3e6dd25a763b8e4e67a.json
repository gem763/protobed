And he announced Britain will ramp up preparations to crash out of the EU just in case.\n\nIn a major sign Brexit will now be delayed, EU Council President Donald Tusk tonight recommended that a three-month extension is accepted.\n\nThat could prompt Boris Johnson to carry out his threat to drop the \"paused\" deal altogether and push for an election instead.\n\nIt came after another night of high drama in the House of Commons just nine days before the UK is meant to leave the EU.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMr Johnson had hoped MPs would approve his EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the 110-page document that would put his Brexit deal into law.\n\nIn a historic move, MPs finally backed the deal in principle by 30 votes. But 15 minutes later they rejected a 'programme motion' to rush it through the Commons by 14 votes.\n\nBoris Johnson was due to speak to EU leaders tonight and say Britain \"should\" still leave on October 31.\n\nBut in a major admission of defeat, the Prime Minister failed to repeat his hardline claims that the October 31 date would definitely happen. And Downing Street also refused to confirm the UK would still leave on Halloween.\n\nInstead Mr Johnson said: \"One way or another we will leave the EU with this deal to which the House has just given its assent.\"\n\nWith the PM insisting the Bill would progress at a later date, Jeremy Corbyn offered to enter talks with Mr Johnson about the way forward.\n\nLabour's leader said: \"Work with all of us to agree a reasonable timetable, and I suspect this House will vote to debate, scrutinise \u2013 and I hope amend \u2013 the detail of this Bill.\"\n\nBut despite his comments, it's understood Boris Johnson is still considering abandoning the Bill altogether if the EU grants a delay to January.\n\nMPs voted 329-299 (52% to 48%) to pass the 'second reading' of the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill - its first Commons hurdle where it is approved in principle.\n\nBut they then voted 322-308 to reject a 'programme motion' to spend just 20 hours, on Wednesday and Thursday, passing the details of the crucial Bill through the Commons.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMPs said the time was far too short amid massive fears over the historic Bill's effect on workers' rights, customs checks in the Irish Sea and the influence of EU courts.\n\nCritics also feared it would open a 'trapdoor to no deal' on 1 January 2021 by denying MPs a voice over whether a transition period should be extended.\n\nBoris Johnson said it was \"joyful\" that MPs had finally \"embraced\" a Brexit deal. But he added: \"I must express my regret that the House has again voted for delay. We now face further uncertainty.\n\n\"The first consequence is that the government must take the only responsible course and accelerate our preparations for a no-deal outcome.\n\n\"Secondly, I will speak to EU member states about their intentions until they have reached a decision. Until they've reached a decision we will pause this legislation.\n\n\"Let me be clear - our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on October 31. And that is what I will say to the EU and I will report back to the house.\n\n\"One way or another we will leave the EU with this deal to which the House has just given its assent.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn said: \"Tonight, the House has refused to be bounced into debating a hugely significantly piece of legislation in just two days with barely any notice or an analysis of the economic impact of this bill.\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister is the author of his own misfortune.\n\n\u201cSo I make this offer to him tonight: work with all of us to agree a reasonable timetable, and I suspect this House will vote to debate, scrutinise \u2013 and I hope amend \u2013 the detail of this Bill.\n\n\u201cThat would be the sensible way forward, and that\u2019s the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight.\u201d\n\nThe government offered a last-minute compromise to MPs in a bid to get them on side.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said he could bring forward an amendment to help close a \"trapdoor\" to no-deal Brexit.\n\nAs it stands, MPs wouldn't be able to demand an extension to the transition period which ends in December 2020. Critics feared that would lead the UK to crash out on 1 January 2021.\n\nMr Buckland said: \"We accept that Parliament has a legitimate role to play.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"And I can bring forward an amendment to that effect that would allow Parliament to have its say on the merits of an extension of the implementation period.\n\n\"And the government will abide by that.\"\n\nBut while it helped win a majority for the deal - which after Theresa May failed three times is historic - it was not enough to stop MPs demanding more time for debate.\n\nTonight's decision means it is almost impossible for the government to pass the Bill all the way through Parliament before October 31.\n\nSo either Boris Johnson must come up with a fresh 'programme motion' or statement on Commons business, or abandon the Bill altogether and push for an election.\n\nLabour's chief whip offered to enter talks with Tory whips to come up with a new timetable.\n\nBut the government refused to buckle.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nInstead Boris Johnson descended into threats - saying if the EU delayed Brexit until January he would abandon his Bill altogether and ask MPs to let him have an election.\n\nMr Johnson - who needs 434 MPs to back an election, and whose previous pleas have been turned down twice - told the House of Commons: \"Let me be very clear.\n\n\u201cI will in no way allow months more of this.\n\n\u201cIf Parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen, and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this.\n\n\u201cWith great regret I must say the Bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward to a general election .\"\n\nIf the Bill does go ahead it still faces a rocky and uncertain road to whether it becomes law.\n\nMajor flashpoint amendments will include a bid for a customs union and second referendum. MPs also want to close a 'trapdoor to no-deal' at the end of 2020 in the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nIn a speech peppered with lies and half-truths Boris Johnson said \"nothing\" in the Bill undermined workers' rights and claimed it would let Britain \"heal and unite\".\n\nBut tonight's debate ended in acrimony as Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - a former Remain voter - complained an unknown MP had called him a \"traitor\".\n\nHe told MPs: \"There comes a time when all of our ourselves have to look at ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves: Are we up to the level of events?\n\n\"Are we truly going to serve the people who put us here?\"\n\nLabour's Nick Thomas-Symonds slammed the Prime Minister for trying to \"ram through this Bill in three days with such little scrutiny.\"\n\nHe fumed: \"This country deserves more than this botched deal and this rushed legislation and that's why we'll be voting against.\"\n\nAnd Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged MPs to vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, calling it a \"rotten deal\" and a \"charter for deregulation\".\n\nHe urged Labour colleagues to think \"very, very carefully\" about how they vote on the Bill tonight, amid indications some backbenchers in the party could support the deal on its second reading.\n\nHe said: \"The Prime Minister is trying to blindside this Parliament to force this deal through, and this Parliament must challenge him in doing that.\"", "description": "Brexit has been hurled into fresh chaos as Boris Johnson finally dropped his hardline pledge to leave on October 31 - and put his deal on ice", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Oliver Milne", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700460.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
