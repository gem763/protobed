REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nThe Fed has cut rates twice this year as U.S. businesses were hit by rising trade tensions with China, political risk including Britain\u2019s chaotic divorce from the European Union, and weakening economic growth in Germany and elsewhere.\n\nEvans said this was setting inflation on course to accelerate to 2.2% by 2021 while the U.S. economy would continue to grow according to its long-term trend, creating leeway to raise the Fed\u2019s key interest rate over the next few years.\n\n\u201cIn that environment I have the Federal Funds Rate inching up a little bit through the end of our forecast period,\u201d Evans told reporters in Frankfurt.\n\nThis would leave the benchmark \u201cjust a little bit below what I think is the neutral (rate)\u201d\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said recent rate cuts represented a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment\u201d to policy designed to sustain the expansion.\n\nThough some Fed policymakers believe more rate cuts will still be needed, Evans endorsed Powell\u2019s view on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI concluded that the situation called for us to cut policy rates 50 to 75 basis points below the long-run neutral rate and then leave policy on hold for a time,\u201d Evans said in a speech at a regional office of Germany\u2019s central bank.\n\nHe, like many of his colleagues, had as recently as December thought that with unemployment near 50-year lows the Fed could raise rates to above 3% this year and still hit its 2% inflation goal.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s July and September rate cuts brought the Fed\u2019s target range for overnight borrowing costs to 1.75%-2.00%, below the 2.5% that most Fed policymakers view as \u201cneutral\u201d in a healthy economy.\n\nEvans also suggested that letting inflation modestly overrun 2% for some time \u201cwould not be a policy error\u201d in the face of falling inflation expectations by businesses and households.\n\nPushing back against President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for the U.S. central bank to slash rates to zero or below, Evans emphasized the limits of Fed policy. Lowering rates, he said, cannot do much to boost the underlying growth potential of the economy amid \u201ctoday\u2019s uncertain and hostile trade climate.\u201d", "description": "The Federal Reserve has set monetary policy to where it can deliver on its 2% inflation goal and there is scope to raise rates slightly over the next few years if the economy continues to grow, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435810752&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9029L", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
