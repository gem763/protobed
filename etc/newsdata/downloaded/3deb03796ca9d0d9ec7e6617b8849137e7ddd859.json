[The ASX] is a great business because a number of its key revenue streams are monopoly revenue streams \u2013 and [ETFs] was one of those.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re slowly bringing competition to additional parts of the exchange market.\u201d\n\nKapstream managing director Steve Goldman said Challenger chose Chi-X over the ASX for its active ETF products due to more attractive costs and lack of any requirements to make portfolio changes.\n\nChi-X director of products Shane Miller said the ASX\u2019s comparatively more stringent listing rules require some fund managers to make unpalatable adjustments to underlying assets.\n\n\u201cThere is more flexibility in our rules at the moment, but we do expect the ASX to catch up over time,\u201d Mr Miller said.\n\nActive ETFs flip to fixed income\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the Australian ETF market has grown to a value of more than $50 billion, Mr Jokovic said we are \u201cjust seeing the start of that explosion\u201d.\n\nChi-X expects the number of fund managers seeking to list and trade their products on an exchange to accelerate, particularly those specialised in fixed income and bond strategies.\n\n\u201cWe have four to five managers coming to the funds market within months and they are all active fixed income managers,\u201d Mr Jokovic said. \u201cThere are others looking to bring the same product to the market.\u201d\n\nMr Goldman, a former fixed income portfolio manager with Goldman Sachs Asset Management in New York, said trading managed funds on an exchange provides investors with liquidity and spares them the administrative barriers associated with unlisted funds.\n\n\u201cI would view the ETF as a channel that is easier for investors to access,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fill out the lengthy documentation, it\u2019s primitive and difficult for investors.\u201d\n\nIn a low interest rate environment, active fixed income ETFs may emerge as an attractive alternative to term deposits, Mr Goldman suggested.\n\n\u201cWe take less than 1 per cent annualised volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cCapital preservation is our No. 1 priority. We are probably the lowest risk product out there in the market.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnding monopoly power\n\nMr Jokovic is frank about Chi-X\u2019s objective to steal market share from the ASX and force Australia\u2019s dominant exchange into further fee compression.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be less noise around the ASX than other big monopolies,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people still seem to think it is a mutual that acts in the best interests of the brokers, rather than a corporate acting in the best interests of shareholders.\u201d\n\nHe estimated that stockbrokers have saved a total of $250 million in fees since Chi-X entered the market, though conceded he can\u2019t take full credit and that technological disruption and other factors have also placed downward pressure on trading-related fees.\n\nHe also conceded some elements of monopoly power are more difficult to erode than others.\n\nAustralia\u2019s largest trading platform, CommSec, provides access to the Chi-X exchange, including the funds market from today. But other trading platforms and brokerages are \u201cstragglers'', he admitted.\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges with the monopoly power has been that people have developed their systems according to the needs of that provider,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything in Australia has been built to an ASX dynamic. Everything is an extra step today in terms of tech.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on the launch of the Chi-X funds market and suggestion that it may be forced into more competitive pricing, an ASX spokesperson indicated the dominant exchange is unfazed by the development.\n\n\"ASX offers over 200 listed exchange-traded products with a market cap of almost $56 billion,\" the spokesperson said. \"ASX is the home of exchange-traded products in Australia.\"", "description": "Kapstream Capital, a member of Challenger\u2019s Fidante stable, will be the first fund manager to participate in Chi-X\u2019s active ETF rival market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_570%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/880dfce5f516768db1a2153235f587be45fe468d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
