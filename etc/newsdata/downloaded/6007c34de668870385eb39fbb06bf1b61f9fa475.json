The EU said it would retaliate.\n\nScotch and Irish whisky made in the UK will be subject to the tariffs but not whiskey from Ireland. The US spared cognac and champagne from the list but announced tariffs of 25% on goods including French wine, Italian and Dutch cheese and Spanish ham.\n\nGary Smith, the Scotland secretary of the GMB union, said the move represented a \u201ctroubling glimpse into the post-Brexit future\u201d for the UK. \u201cScotland and the rest of the UK are sitting ducks after October 31st. The collective strength we have in the EU trading bloc will be gone and there is simply no such thing as a \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the United States \u2013 Trump will squeeze the UK economy for everything he can get,\u201d he said.\n\nScotch whisky exports to the US were worth \u00a31bn last year, , supporting a wider industry employing 11,000 people across Scotland. Karen Betts, the chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the tariffs would put jobs and investment at risk. \u201cDespite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our sector has been hit hard.\u201d\n\nAirbus shares rose most on France\u2019s CAC 40 index of leading companies, in a sign that investors had feared a stiffer sanction was possible.\n\nAnalysts said the tariffs may not be as bad as first feared for European drinks makers. Shares in Diageo, the owner of brands including Lagavulin and Baileys, rose by 1.9% on Thursday despite a fall in the FTSE 100 of about 0.6%. Shares in the French distillers R\u00e9my Cointreau and Pernod Ricard also rose.\n\nThe US investment bank Jefferies said about $440m of revenue at Diageo would be affected by the tariffs, about 5% of its total US sales.\n\nA spokesperson for the UK\u2019s Department for International Trade said: \u201cResorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US. The UK is working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes.\u201d\n\nEU goods affected by US tariffs\n\nPlanes, Irish and Scotch whiskies, jumpers, suits, coats, pyjamas, swimwear, blankets, bed linen, coffee, metal tools, axes and knives, biscuits, wine, meat (sausages, ham), cheese (stilton, cheddar, edam, gruy\u00e8re, gouda, emmental, parmesan, reggiano, pecorino), butter, yoghurt, olive oil, mussels, cockles and clams, fruit (cherries, peaches, pears, oranges, lemons) and fruit juice.", "description": "Industry body says tariffs put jobs at risk but shares in European drinks makers rise", "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68bca07b1e42a20e07898cbd979fa08b27469535/377_370_3123_1874/master/3123.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3066216ce1346e31d3226679561d7ba1"}
