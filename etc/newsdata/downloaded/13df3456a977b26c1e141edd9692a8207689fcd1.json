REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File Photo\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - L\u00e1zaro de Mello Brand\u00e3o, the former chairman of Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA) died on Wednesday at 93, after decades of building the bank into Brazil\u2019s second-largest private-sector lender.\n\nBrand\u00e3o had stepped down two years ago after a 75-year career at the bank. He joined Bradesco in 1942 and worked alongside founder Amador Aguiar. The bank confirmed in a statement that he had passed away at a hospital in Sao Paulo.\n\nBrand\u00e3o long kept a tight grip on the lender, serving as chief executive from 1981 to 1999 and chairman from 1990 to 2017. Even after leaving his job as chairman, Brand\u00e3o was seen almost daily at his desk in the bank\u2019s head office.\n\n\u201cHe had an intense and vigorous working rhythm, which was contagious for all of us,\u201d Bradesco CEO Octavio de Lazari Junior said in a statement. \u201cHe used to be one of the first ones to arrive at our headquarters every day.\u201d\n\nUnder Brand\u00e3o\u2019s leadership, Bradesco acquired more than 20 financial institutions, including the Brazilian unit of HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) in 2015. The bank held 1.41 trillion reais ($338 billion) in assets in June, behind only Itau Unibanco Holdings (ITUB4.SA) among private-sector banks in Brazil.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian financial system lost one of its best-known executives,\u201d Bradesco Chairman Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi said in a statement.\n\nBrand\u00e3o championed the idea that Bradesco should open its branches to Brazilians of all classes, even as some rivals focused on upscale clients and cities to improve profitability.\n\n\u201cBrand\u00e3o was a key man not only for building one of the world\u2019s largest banks, but also for helping Brazil\u2019s economic development in the recent decades,\u201d Itau CEO Candido Bracher said in a statement.\n\nSergio Rial, CEO of Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA), said Brandao \u201cled the Brazilian financial industry for a long time and left a valuable legacy.\u201d", "description": "L\u00e1zaro de Mello Brand\u00e3o, the former chairman of Banco Bradesco SA died on Wednesday at 93, after decades of building the bank into Brazil's second-largest private-sector lender.", "authors": ["Carolina Mandl", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441484104&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F159", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
