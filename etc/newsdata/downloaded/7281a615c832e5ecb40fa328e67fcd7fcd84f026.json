The break began when Cohen turned on the president, ultimately blaming his former client for landing him in prison over campaign-finance violations that prosecutors say Trump directed.\n\nBut some Democrats say it\u2019s only a matter of time until Trump treats Giuliani to the same fate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before, with Michael Cohen,\u201d Rouda said. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s going to get thrown under the bus. The president's going to make it sound like \u2018I didn\u2019t tell him to do this or that, he was rogue, he went out on his own.\u2019 And we all know that\u2019s not true, but I think we can all lay a bet down on how this story ends. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see.\u201d\n\nDemocrats seeking to substantiate Trump\u2019s intimate involvement with Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts have been bolstered by a parade of witnesses detailing the extent to which Trump sought to run his Ukraine policy through Giuliani, who was pressing Kyiv to launch probes of Trump\u2019s political rivals. That body of testimony is set to grow next week, when Bill Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, testifies on Tuesday, in addition to some State Department and Pentagon officials later in the week.\n\nOne witness who has already testified for nine hours, Gordon Sondland, underscored the \u201cnexus\u201d that Democrats see between Trump and Giuliani. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said he was ultimately \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Trump\u2019s desire to involve Giuliani.\n\n\u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Sondland told investigators, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by POLITICO.\n\nIn text messages Friday, Giuliani said he couldn't discuss his private discussions with his client, Trump, but that his work on Ukraine was actually less than meets the eye -- and all done in public view.\n\n\"I was never in Ukraine at all and my investigatory work was done when it was still possible [special counsel Robert] Mueller would charge Russian collusion. Almost all of it was published in the Hill, so [Trump] and everyone else was aware of it,\" Giuliani said. \"Hardly anything not public.\"\n\nGiuliani said all of his work to unearth information on Biden was made public in April. Subsequently, he said, then-Hill columnist John Solomon \"picked it up and did much more.\" Giuliani said his actual work on Ukraine is less than it appears because the reporting on it that followed his own efforts added to the material he was collecting.\n\n\"Since the public record is more extensive than what I did, he and all of you probably think I did more than I really did,\" Giuliani said.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, though, Republicans have indicated they\u2019re uncomfortable with Giuliani\u2019s behavior toward Ukraine and have questioned his methods and mission. Though Trump\u2019s allies are careful to pin any questionable conduct on Giuliani alone, Democrats see their unwillingness to defend Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine as an opening to tie potential wrongdoing to the president.\n\nRepublicans, though, are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, saying they\u2019re not sure that the president had full awareness of Giuliani\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the president knew everything that Rudy was saying and doing. And if I was asked to make an assumption, I would say that he didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nBut even some of the president\u2019s closest allies have suggested that Giuliani\u2019s involvement wasn\u2019t above-board. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) distanced himself from the \u201cCrowdstrike\u201d theory that both Giuliani and Trump have pursued and amplified \u2014 the debunked assertion that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a \u2018Crowdstrike\u2019 fan,\u201d Meadows told POLITICO, adding: \u201cI would not, on my dime, send a private attorney looking for some server in a foreign country.\u201d\n\nBut Meadows said it was understandable that Trump, who feels aggrieved that he has been investigated for ties to Russia, would listen to Giuliani.\n\n\u201cWhen you get falsely accused of a number of things that are not facts, you\u2019re willing to listen to a whole lot of things that may have been a problem,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nBut attempts by Republicans seeking to separate Trump from Giuliani were complicated Thursday when Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney declared that the White House withheld military assistance from Ukraine in part because Trump wanted assurances that the country\u2019s new president would probe the debunked Crowdstrike matter. Mulvaney later walked back the comments.\n\nThere are indications, though, that some House Republicans are beginning to question Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful to me to see this kind of amateur diplomacy riding roughshod over our State Department apparatus,\u201d said Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), a former ambassador and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Rooney on Friday indicated that he was open to supporting impeachment but is awaiting more witness interviews.\n\n\u201cI want to get the facts and do the right thing,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I\u2019m looking at anybody in this building.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle, Melanie Zanona and Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Kruse"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3d/11/5dc6f647405bb298914a1cbbb7a5/191018-donald-trump-giuliani-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
