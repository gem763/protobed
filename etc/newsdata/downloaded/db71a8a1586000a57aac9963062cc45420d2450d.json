Deselecting two looks like carelessness.\n\nOr, worse, conspiracy.\n\nLast weekend a move was triggered to lever Jewish-born Dame Margaret Hodge out of London\u2019s Barking which she has represented for 25 years.\n\nNow Dame Louise Ellman faces the same fate in the Liverpool Riverside seat she has held since 1997.\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nWhat they have in common is criticising Jeremy Corbyn for his failure to tackle anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.\n\nThe attempted coups against Margaret and Louise are not the Labour leader\u2019s fault directly.\n\nThey are victims of new rules which makes deselection easier.\n\nBut these actions by local activists serve to reinforce the perception that Labour is institutionally anti-Semitic.\n\nBad MPs of whatever religious background should indeed be removed.\n\nBut these are good MPs.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAnd Corbyn could redress some of the damage being done to his party by speaking up for them.\n\nFunerals should be a grave matter\n\nBoris Johnson toyed with zipping over to Paris last week for the funeral of former French president Jacques Chirac.\n\nThen he thought, nah, not enough EU leaders there with whom to discuss Brexit.\n\nBrexit Countdown Days til we leave EU 0 Days 0 Hours 0 minutes 0 Seconds\n\nRubbing shoulders with mourners Vladimir Putin and ex-prez Bill Clinton wouldn\u2019t have been much use to him.\n\nYou can imagine the PM talking this through with girlfriend Carrie Symonds before making that decision.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBORIS: This is a heaven sent opportunity.\n\nCARRIE: Literally.\n\nBORIS: Better than a summit because there are no expectations. People don\u2019t expect leaders to come back with test-ban treaties or quota reductions so we can have meaningful discussions.\n\nCARRIE: And what if you don\u2019t sort it all out?\n\nBORIS: We\u2019ll just have to hope that before too long somebody else important snuffs it.\n\nHave I been eavesdropping on the lovebirds? Nope.\n\nIt comes verbatim from a 1986 episode of Yes, Prime Minister.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt's all lies, lies, lies\n\nThe Tory conference bookshop, Blackwells, must have had Boris Johnson in mind when selecting titles for sale.\n\nThey included The Noble Liar, Kingdom of Lies, and Sex, Lies and Politics.\n\nNot my bag, says Brexit chief\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nTalk about worst case no-deal scenarios.\n\nPlaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards last week asked Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay: \u201cHow many bodybags have been stockpiled for use in Wales as part of contingency planning for the UK leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement?\u201d\n\nThe MP was told it was a devolved matter!\n\nSounds a bit fishy to me\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the Manchester restaurant full of swivel-eyed Brexiteers that spoiled the sea bass I ordered.\n\nIt was the waitress saying: \u201cThere\u2019s just one problem.\u201d\n\nThis sentence implies a difficulty which might be overcome.\n\nWas it too big or too small perhaps?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the waitress. \u201cProblem is we don\u2019t have any.\u201d\n\nI'm a chair not a mayor\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTory chairman James Cleverly was irritated at conference to be constantly mistaken for Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTalking to one guest at a reception James realised something wasn\u2019t quite right and asked: \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\n\nThe delegate, anxious to please, replied: \u201cOf course. You\u2019re the next Mayor of London.\u201d", "description": "Everyone seems to expect an election this year.
