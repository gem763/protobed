REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that the move would generate savings, but Trump on Monday said the White House would likely end its subscriptions to the papers because they are \u201cfake,\u201d a term he has used to describe coverage that he views as unfavorable.\n\n\u201cNot renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving for taxpayers - hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the directive would be issued or go into effect. The Wall Street Journal reported the White House\u2019s plan earlier on Tuesday.\n\nThe New York Times declined to comment, while the Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump has often railed against the coverage of him and his administration and singled out the two newspapers in particular. He has made complaints about the U.S. media a regular staple at his campaign rallies.\n\nTrump said in an interview with Fox News Channel on Monday the White House would likely cut its subscriptions to the two newspapers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even want it in the White House anymore. We\u2019re going to probably terminate that (the New York Times) and The Washington Post. They\u2019re fake,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many subscriptions to the two newspapers the U.S. government has. The Washington Post offers free digital access to federal employees with a valid government email address.\n\nTrump is a fervent reader of the two newspapers, a habit he is unlikely to break even after the directive is issued, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe order comes as Trump comes under perhaps the most focused scrutiny of his administration, in the form of the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe probe, which was launched last month, stems from a July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate the family of one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, leading Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.", "description": "The White House said on Thursday it is planning to order federal agencies to end their subscriptions to the New York Times and the Washington Post after repeated criticism of their coverage by President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444617136&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1WP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
