The company\u2019s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, is scheduled to testify before two congressional committees, on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, the first time a Boeing executive has appeared at a hearing related to the crashes. Boeing\u2019s stock lost 7 percent of its value on Friday, adding to the financial fallout.\n\nThe existence of the messages strike at Boeing\u2019s defense that it had done nothing wrong regarding the Max because regulators had cleared the plane to fly, and potentially increases the company\u2019s legal exposure as it faces civil and criminal investigations and multiple lawsuits related to both crashes. Facing competition from Airbus, Boeing worked to produce the Max as quickly as possible, striving to minimize costly training for pilots. Last week, a task force of 10 international regulators released a report that found that Boeing had not fully explained MCAS to the F.A.A.\n\n[Read the messages between the Boeing pilot and his colleague about the MCAS issue.]\n\n\u201cThis is more evidence that Boeing misled pilots, government regulators and other aviation experts about the safety of the 737 Max,\u201d Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in a statement on Friday.\n\nBoeing has maintained that the Max was certified in accordance with all appropriate regulations, suggesting that there was no sign that MCAS was unsafe.\n\nThat contention was central to the company\u2019s rationale in not grounding the Max after the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 last October, and in waiting days to recommend grounding the plane after the second crash, of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March.", "description": "Two years before two deadly crashes, a top pilot told a colleague that a new automated system, known as MCAS, was causing trouble in flight simulators.", "authors": ["David Gelles", "Natalie Kitroeff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/business/18BOEING-01/18BOEING-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
