The results were bolstered by strong production of Tesla\u2019s flagship Model 3, which spiked 43% year over year.\n\nHowever, the results fell short of some of Wall Street\u2019s more rosy estimates, and the 100,000 mark CEO Elon Musk reportedly told employees was a real possibility. Although the company has boosted overseas deliveries and incentivized sales, Tesla remains dogged by doubts about its cash flow and ability to sustain production.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America pointed out that \u201calthough total Model 3 deliveries increased materially\u201d at a year-over-year rate of 43%, that gain was \u201cmuch less pronounced on a sequential basis, up just 2.5% from 2Q:19.\u201d\n\nFILE - In this March 14, 2019, file photo the Tesla Model Y is unveiled at Tesla's design studio in Hawthorne, Calif.

The bank rates Tesla\u2019s stock as an Underperform, with a price target of $225.\n\nThe shares, traded on the Nasdaq, shed nearly $17 from Wednesday\u2019s close to trade around $226.\n\nJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
