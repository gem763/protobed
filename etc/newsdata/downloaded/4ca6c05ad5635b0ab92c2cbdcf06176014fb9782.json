Since the inquiry was sparked by a whistle-blower complaint from the intelligence community, the most visible leader of the impeachment process is still expected to be Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nThis would give Maloney an important but mostly behind-the-scenes role in hearings to gather evidence on Trump\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine, which could be the basis for article of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been decided,\u201d said Representative Lacy Clay, a Missouri Democrat and Oversight Committee member, who has also been suggested as a candidate. But Clay said he will not make a bid and understands that Maloney has it sewn up.\n\nActing Chairwoman\n\nIf confirmed, Maloney will bring a long record of legislative accomplishments as well as her sometimes quirky mannerism. She recently drew attention in the Capitol (and at the Met Gala) for wearing firefighting gear. She did so as a lead sponsor of the 9/11 victims fund re-authorization to help first-responders and survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The measure was one of this year\u2019s rare examples of a bipartisan bill signed into law.\n\nReflecting the importance of the financial industry in her district, which includes parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, Maloney is also a senior member of the Financial Services Committee and vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee\n\nMaloney has been temporarily leading the Oversight panel since Cummings died Oct. 17. The late chairman was a more infrequent presence on Capitol Hill as he fell ill in recent weeks, and committee staff members have been working with other panels to schedule and question witnesses.\n\nAt least two other Democrats -- Representatives Gerald Connolly of Virginia and Jackie Speier of California, both 69 -- have considered seeking the chairmanship, according to their colleagues. Connolly declined to speak about that possibility while the House was in mourning for Cummings, and Speier\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about her interest.\n\nMaloney\u2019s office declined to comment on the record.\n\nSeniority\n\nMaloney moved to New York as a young adult where she became a city council member mostly in the 1980s, investigating city contracts, including those linked to organized crime. She has built a mostly liberal voting record, with leading roles on census and gun issues.\n\nShe drew national attention in 2012 for walking out of an Oversight hearing on contraception and and religious liberty after noting the all-male list of witnesses.\n\nMaloney has had to juggle her constituents who work in banking with her push to reform to the industry, especially her role crafting part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street overhaul. The House recently passed an anti-money laundering bill she sponsored that Wall Street banks supported for sharing compliance responsibility with private companies.\n\nClay said he and many Democrats, including the powerful Congressional Black Caucus of more than 50 members, simply believe it is Maloney\u2019s turn to lead the Oversight Committee. She was passed over for the job of ranking member when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi favored Cummings after Democrats lost the House majority in 2010.\n\nThe Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, controlled by Pelosi, plays a big role in nominating the eventual chairman, to be ratified by the 234-member Democratic Caucus. Members expect the decision to be finalized by the end of next month.\n\nPelosi hasn\u2019t indicated who she prefers to lead the Oversight Committee. A spokesman, Drew Hammill, when asked Thursday if Pelosi is backing Maloney, said: \u201cShe has not said that.
