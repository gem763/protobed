So we have requested documents relating to Mr Depp's commission of domestic violence against other romantic partners.\"\n\nDepp's team slammed this request as irrelevant, before the judge asked why Depp, in his lawsuit, said that he had never committed domestic violence toward anyone.\n\nDepp's lawyer replied: \"Mr Depp understood that this case, since the public op-ed, is going to be in the public press. And so it's important for him to say that.\"\n\nHeard's lawyers attempted to keep the case private, and she said she didn't want her life, or the lives of those close to her, in the public eye.\n\nDepp's attorneys, meanwhile, have made repeated claims that he has \"nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe lawyer representing the star slammed the latest claims to DailyMail.com , saying that they were all part of a \"notorious abuse hoax.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThey continued: \"Having been sued for defamation for her notorious abuse hoax, Amber Heard's #TimesUp lawyer doesn't waste any time trying to prove the unprovable, or dispute the mountain of evidence showing her fraud.\n\n\"Instead, they do what the guilty always do, compounding the original crime with new false allegations and other smearing innuendo.\n\n\"There is a public trial February 3rd, and that is when the truth replaces PR.\"\n\n(Image: Alcon Entertainment)\n\nOther pieces to evidence to be presented to the court will be Herad's texts with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who she had a romance with after splitting from Depp.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, who represents Heard, said to DailyMail.com : \"It is Mr Depp who started this lawsuit on the theory that Ms Heard somehow made up all the abuse that forced her to obtain a restraining order against Mr Depp back in 2016.\n\n\"Now that the facts in his own lawsuit are making him uncomfortable, Mr Depp wants to hide evidence commonly understood to be connected to incidents of domestic violence: his decades-long abuse of drugs and alcohol, his past history of violence and medical records showing among other things the laundry list of prescription medications he takes daily and injuries from his drug-induced rages.\n\n\"Mr Depp started this fight. Ms Heard intends to finish it by proving, if necessary, the truth of what really happened.\"", "description": "Depp is suing his ex-wife Amber Heard over an op-ed she wrote in which she discussed domestic abuse, despite not naming him explicitly", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Pa", "Clint Brewer", "Splash News", "Getty", "Alcon Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14110257.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_FILE-PHOTO-Cast-member-Amber-Heard-and-husband-Johnny-Depp-pose-during-the-premiere-of-the-film.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
