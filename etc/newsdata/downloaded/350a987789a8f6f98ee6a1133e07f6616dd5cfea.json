That deal expires at the end of 2019.\n\nThe relationship between the two allies soured after Seoul abruptly announced the termination of a three-year-old pact with Japan -- another U.S. key ally -- for exchanging classified military information. That was in response to Japan\u2019s move to restrict exports of key materials for the manufacture of semiconductors to South Korea.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Kanga Kong in Seoul at kkong50@bloomberg.net;Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Shamim Adam at sadam2@bloomberg.net, Marcus Wright, Jasmine Ng\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A group of South Korean students broke into the residence of American ambassador Harry Harris on Friday, in a protest against Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to get the Asian nation to pay more for U.S. military support.Nineteen students, who described themselves as members of a liberal university", "authors": ["Kanga Kong", "Jihye Lee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
