(Photo: USA TODAY/20th Century Fox via AP)\n\nIt's time to play ball. Or, at least, press play on a good baseball movie.\n\nThe World Series kicks off on Tuesday. If you're like us and you're living and breathing baseball this October, you can fill in the time before the first pitch with these five baseball movies that are available to stream or rent. BYO Cracker Jacks.\n\nIf you like rooting for the underdog: 'Major League'\n\nBaseball has seen its fair share of underdogs and \"lovable losers\" overcoming championship droughts and expectations to win the World Series. But no real story has come close to the fun of \"Major League.\" The 1989 film follows a team put together by its owner specifically to be the worst baseball team in the league, which begins a winning streak just to spite her.\n\nRent or buy from Amazon, YouTube or Google Play.\n\nIf you want a more mature flick: 'Bull Durham'\n\nKevin Costner is one of Hollywood's baseball film all-stars. \"Field of Dreams\" remains a classic in the genre, but we're also partial to \"Durham,\" which is a frank look at the world of minor league ball.\n\nStream it on Amazon, Hulu or Epix.\n\nIf you want an epic: 'The Natural'\n\nRobert Redford grounds the film as Roy Hobbs, the titular \"natural\" baseball player in the film, which is based on the Bernard Malamud novel. Hobbs' long life saga is examined in the film, from the death of his father at a young age to his against-the-odds resurgence as a professional baseball player on the fictional New York Knights. The film has one of the most exciting at-bat scenes in any baseball film.\n\nRent or buy from Amazon, YouTube or Google Play.\n\nIf you're nostalgic for childhood sports: 'The Sandlot'\n\n\"The Sandlot\" captured the nostalgia for a '60s childhood when it premiered in 1993. The film's endurance as a baseball and childhood classic is due to its strong themes of friendship and youthful innocence.\n\nRent or buy from Amazon, YouTube or Google Play.\n\nIf you love sports documentaries: 'Four Days in October'\n\nESPN's \"30 for 30\" documentary series is an absolute treasure for sports fans who love digging into the history and cultural effects of their favorite players, coaches and games. This episode chronicles how the Boston Red Sox came back from a 3-0 deficit against the Yankees and went on to break their \"curse\" in the 2004 World Series.\n\nStream on ESPN+.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2gyeMAt", "description": "From 'Major League' to 'Four Days in October,' celebrate all things baseball with these films.", "authors": ["Kelly Lawler", "Published A.M.
