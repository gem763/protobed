Six mates always have time to have breakfast together before work. And they can all catch up at any time in the afternoon at Central Perk because they apparently don\u2019t have to do a 9-5.\n\nIn the real world, however, this lackadaisical approach to office hours would land the gang in a whole lot of trouble.\n\nIt has been calculated that over 10 series, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Ross and Chandler committed 58 work indiscretions \u2013 with Rachel Karen Green being the worst employee of them all.\n\nYes, even worse than Joey.\n\nRachel lied that Tag was gay and wrote an inappropriate appraisal for him (Picture: NBC)\n\nB2B furniture e-commerce site Furniture@Work discovered that Rachel racked up 16 indiscretions including six sackable offences, but only got fired once \u2013 when Ralph Lauren found out she was interviewing for Gucci.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther big no-nos were Rachel (played by Jennifer Aniston) admitting she sneezed in rude customers\u2019 muffins at Central Perk, lying that her boss wanted to buy her baby, and writing an inappropriate evaluation for her assistant Tag, who she was dating.\n\nMeanwhile, Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) was hot on her heels with 15 indiscretions \u2013 including lying that he could speak French, lying about being a professional dancer, exposing his hernia to a child and physically fighting with a colleague live on PBS to get more screen time.\n\nMonica was a pretty good worker (Picture: Gary Null/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nPhoebe Buffay had nine indiscretions, with the masseuse (played by Lisa Kudrow) being sacked for kissing a client, being fired from her singing job at Central Perk, and getting the boot from Days Of Our Lives after slapping Joey. She also bit the bottom of the client she fancied which is\u2026 well, pretty horrific.\n\nIn his job as paleontologist, Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) committed eight indiscretions, including having sex with Rachel in the museum where he worked, only to be discovered by children the next day. Then there was the whole \u2018MY SANDWICH?!\u2019 debacle, which led to him being put on sabbatical.\n\nChandler Bing (Matthew Perry) had six indiscretions in his career as\u2026 erm, what did he do again?, including when he destroyed company property while pretending to be another employee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had a sackable offence when he pretended that a colleague he was dating was mentally ill to avoid firing her.\n\nMonica Geller (Courteney Cox) is by far the most trustworthy employee of the gang, despite being fired from a chef job for accepting kickbacks from vendors.\n\nShe had four indiscretions in her career \u2013 including when she hired and fired Joey to earn respect from the rest of her employees.\n\nBut let\u2019s face it \u2013 the whole gang is probably a bit lacking when it comes to references.\n\nFriends is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
