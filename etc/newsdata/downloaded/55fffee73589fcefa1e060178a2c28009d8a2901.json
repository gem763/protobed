He seems to innately understand Trump\u2019s mood and agenda, and tries to make things happen the way Trump wants.\n\nWhen they disagree, Pompeo keeps his personal views so private he sometimes is referred to as a Trump whisperer; Bolton, in contrast, seemed incapable of keeping his opinions to himself.\n\nSo Pompeo made no attempt to sound disappointed at a Tuesday news conference when he was peppered with questions about Bolton\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cThere were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed; that\u2019s to be sure,\u201d Pompeo said at the White House event, frequently breaking into a grin. \u201cBut that\u2019s true for lots of people with whom I interact.\u201d\n\nPompeo\u2019s jocular mood reflected the smoother road that is probably ahead for him as he tries to advance Trump\u2019s foreign policy goals without Bolton around to argue against them.\n\n\u201cBolton\u2019s departure gives Pompeo more running room,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group. \u201cEvery time the president, or Pompeo, or anyone in the administration came up with an idea, they had to face Dr. No. That person has now been fired. So the rest of the team, which is more moderate by definition, will now have an easier time moving their agenda.\u201d\n\nDiverging worldviews haunted Trump-Bolton relationship\n\nUltimately, foreign policy is set by the president, not the secretary of state or the national security adviser. So the impact of Bolton\u2019s leave-taking can be overstated.\n\n\u201cTrump has always been the decider in chief,\u201d said James Carafano, a national security and foreign policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation. \u201cIt was his foreign policy before Bolton came. It will be his foreign policy after Bolton leaves. I don\u2019t think the president cares a hoot if Pompeo and Bolton disagree. What he cares about is getting the decision he needs to get to.\u201d\n\nThe differences between Pompeo and Bolton were less ideological than tactical, though a wide gulf separated the ways they expressed their views to the president and in public.\n\nJohn Glaser, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said policies on North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan should be communicated with fewer indications of internal strife.\n\n\u201cPompeo is as much a hawk on Iran as Bolton,\u201d Glaser said. \u201cNegotiations with North Korea will be less hindered, with less internal dissent. It mostly boils down to Bolton\u2019s reputation as a bureaucratic manipulator who makes enemies within the executive branch as a matter of habit. Unlike Bolton, Pompeo has a way of going along with Trump and not boldly stating where they disagree on policy.\u201d\n\nEven stylistic differences can have a major effect on diplomacy, however. Early in his tenure as national security adviser, Bolton nearly ended talks with North Korea when he endorsed the \u201cLibya model\u201d for nuclear disarmament. North Korea threatened to walk away from a summit in Singapore, perceiving a threat because the Libyan model helped lead to the toppling of Moammar Gaddafi\u2019s regime by a domestic uprising and a NATO-led coalition.\n\n\u201cThat revealed the true side of Bolton,\u201d said Steve Pomper, who served in the State Department and the National Security Council during the Obama administration. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who\u2019s a maximalist. He doesn\u2019t believe in measure-for-measure deals and is very skeptical of taking his foot off the gas until the end of the road. The problem is, you don\u2019t get there unless you\u2019re willing to do measure-for-measure deals.\u201d\n\nPompeo, in contrast, has shown himself willing to negotiate with Pyongyang, Tehran and the Taliban, all policies promoted by Trump.\n\n\u201cBolton was ideological and brought his ideology onto the job with him,\u201d said Pomper, who now is the senior director of policy for the International Crisis Group. \u201cPompeo may be ideological. But while serving in the administration, his ideology is sublimated to his role as an enabler.\u201d\n\nAaron David Miller, a former State Department official who is a foreign-policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment, said Bolton effectively self-destructed through his bellicose public pronouncements. Pompeo\u2019s silence has allowed him to thrive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really quite a feat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can only say no to a president so many times, and then the president stops listening or essentially writes you off. Pompeo was a \u2018Yes, but . . .\u2019 man. Because of that, he\u2019s survived. Now, assuming he stays, Pompeo may now have the opportunity to become one of strongest secretaries of state in recent years.\u201d\n\nIt is too early to tell how shedding Bolton will affect whether Pompeo resigns and decides to run for the Senate in his home state of Kansas. Political allies in Congress and in Kansas have been urging him to vie for the seat being vacated by Sen. Pat Roberts (R), who is not seeking a fifth term. Pompeo is be widely favored to win the nomination and would be a strong Republican candidate in the general election. The filing deadline for the primary is in June.\n\nMiller, for one, thinks the case just became stronger for Pompeo to stay where he is, for the sake of continuity in perilous times.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan, among a lot of issues that are all incomplete and all politically resonant,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIf I were running the railroad, I would not want to lose the secretary of state. Pompeo has proven himself to be resilient, if nothing else. And relatively consistent.\u201d", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is likely to have more autonomy in shaping foreign policy with the exit of his chief rival for influence with Trump.", "authors": ["Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMHZCPGUCUI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
