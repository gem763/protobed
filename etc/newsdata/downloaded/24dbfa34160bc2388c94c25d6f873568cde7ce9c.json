Elevated consumer confidence should continue to bolster consumer spending over the near term, keeping the slowdown in US economic data contained in the industrial sector.\u201d\n\nAugust\u2019s consumer confidence data revealed that Americans are still confident and optimist about the current situation. The present situation gauge in August was the highest level since November 2000.\n\nNevertheless, Wells Fargo warned of a growing divergence between the Conference Board\u2019s reading of consumer confidence and the University of Michigan\u2019s survey of consumers. The firm argued that the disagreement between the two measures is a worrisome sign. \u201cA look at the nearby chart makes it clear that in the past 25 years, there have been very few times where there has been this much of a gap between the two,\u201d Wells Fargo wrote in a note Friday. \u201cMore worryingly, each of the past three recessions were preceded by a widening gap. Some of the disparity may have to do with the recent escalation in the trade war.\u201d\n\nEconomists polled by Bloomberg expect September\u2019s Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index reading of 133, down from 135.1 in August.\n\nMeanwhile, on the corporate earnings front, Nike will be reporting quarterly results after the market close Tuesday. Retail has been in the spotlight over the past several months as the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods looks to bleed over to the consumer.\n\nThough many are concerned that the ongoing trade war will negatively impact Nike the shoemaker\u2019s management didn\u2019t sound worried on following its fiscal fourth-quarter results. Nike CEO Mark Parker said, \u201cWe are, and remain, a brand of China, for China.\u201d\n\nWhen analysts asked Parker about the tariffs and the economic slowdown in China, he responded, \u201cWe have not seen any impact on our business to date, and we continue to see strong momentum as we enter fiscal year 2020.\u201d\n\nOther notable earnings reports scheduled for this week include homebuilder KB Home, pharmacy retailer Rite Aid and chipmaker Micron.\n\nNike shoes are seen displayed at a sporting goods store in New York City, New York, U.S., May 14, 2019.
