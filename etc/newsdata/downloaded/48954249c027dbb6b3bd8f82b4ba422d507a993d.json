The mother of six walks her 10-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son to school each day in Kaysville. Her 3-year-old son comes with them, the Deseret News reports .\n\n\u201cWe found ourselves unplugging a lot more and having a lot more meaningful conversation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Kaysville family is among the 1,100 participants in September for a Utah Department of Transportation program encouraging people to walk or bike to school by offering a prize contest where winners get bikes, scooters and helmets.\n\nHe daughter, Abby, said she likes the new morning routine better than driving to school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI like walking to school because I get to talk with my mom. Sometimes, I also like it because then I have a couple of more minutes to stay with my mom.\u201d\n\nThe Duncans are fortunate that they are close to the school, Columbia Elementary, which means their walk is only about five minutes. As they arrive on a recent day, the parking lot is filled with a line of cars dropping off kids, creating congestion as parents come and go in the morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also been important to us to recognize that as we are reducing our drive time, we are becoming more aware of our environment and the impact that we are making on it,\u201d Duncan said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Deseret News, http://www.deseretnews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Utah mother who started walking her children to school every day after an epilepsy diagnosis prevented her from driving has discovered she loves the conversations and extra time she gets with her children.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/mother-epilepsy_diagnosis_04041_c0-216-4100-2607_s1200x700.jpg?f3dc5821b47415ff82368ee254f7c58b4063ba5a", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
