He then repeated the sentence for emphasis.\n\nThe secessionists, nine of whom will serve jail terms of up to 13 years, were convicted for sedition, disobedience and misuse of public funds.\n\nDays of violent demonstrations have rocked Barcelona since the court's decision, leading to at least 130 injuries and flight cancellations at the city's airport.\n\nS\u00e1nchez warned: \u201cThere will be no space for impunity regarding the vandalism we have seen in the last few days in some Catalan cities.\u201d And he paid homage to the police, saying \u201cthey are acting in a model way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legalization of the political crisis has now ended after the sentencing of the Supreme Court. I believe that we cannot repeat a path that has filled Catalan society with frustration, failure and fracture. Now we need to open a new chapter.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez, an acting PM who faces a second general election in November, defended the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. \u201cIn Spain all freedoms, all rights and all opinions are respected and no one is punished for his or her ideas, only for actions when these contravene legal democracy.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Catalonia's President Quim Torra, who has called for a fresh independence vote, said the sentences were \u201can act of vengeance, not an act of justice.\u201d He also condemned the violence on Catalan streets.\n\nIn Brussels, S\u00e1nchez called on the independence movement to recognize that \u201cCatalonia is not one single people \u2026 it\u2019s a diverse society, a plural society, and so you can\u2019t homogenize something that is pluralistic and diverse.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish Supreme Court also issued a new EU arrest warrant for former Catalan leader Carlos Puigdemont, who voluntarily appeared before Belgian authorities on Friday.", "description": "No one is punished for their ideas in Spain, acting PM says.", "authors": ["Eddy Wax", "Emma Anderson", "Judith Mischke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1157206521-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
