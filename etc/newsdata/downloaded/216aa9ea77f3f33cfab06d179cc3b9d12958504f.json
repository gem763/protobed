Defensive plays like utility and telecom stocks lost between 0.4% and 0.7% as appetite for riskier sectors rose on the day.\n\n\"Earnings have so far not been a disaster, so we are not seeing massive moves,\" said James. \"From the ongoing underlying rotation, it appears that markets are repositioning and dumping some of those defensive stocks.\"\n\nGerman stocks outperformed, lifting the trade-sensitive auto sector to its highest level since May.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials said they were \"close to finalizing\" some parts of a trade agreement, raising hopes that the two countries would call a truce on their long-running trade war that has roiled financial markets.\n\nInvestors will be keeping a close eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting later this week for more clarity and support from the world's biggest central bank to aid a slowing economy.\n\nLUXURY LIFT\n\nLuxury stocks stood out after Louis Vuitton owner LVMH made a bid to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co with a $14.5 billion acquisition offer.\n\nShares of the French luxury goods maker rose and boosted gains in peers Swatch, Pandora and Salvatore Ferragamo.\n\nLuxury companies continue to show resilience with a host of companies beating earnings expectations last week, including Gucci owner Kering, as Chinese shoppers continue to spend heavily on luxury goods.
