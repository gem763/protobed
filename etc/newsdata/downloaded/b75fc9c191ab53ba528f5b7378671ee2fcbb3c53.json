While the Bank of England chief bemoaned the greenback\u2019s \u201cdomineering influence\u201d on trade, he failed to take into account how the dollar\u2019s status has benefited other countries, Potter said at a Peterson Institute for International Economics event in New York on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI see no argument that makes sense to have something that complicated out there when you have large, liquid capital markets in the U.S.,\u201d Potter, who ran the New York Fed\u2019s trading desk, said in his first public remarks since departing in June. \u201cNot having one currency that you can basically price things and have a deep market in, that makes life much harder for the global economy.\u201d\n\nThe dollar\u2019s role in the global financial system is vast: other countries use it to pay international debts, and it commands the lion\u2019s share of central banks\u2019 foreign-exchange reserves. That status has afforded the U.S. several advantages: foreign investors have flocked to dollar-denominated assets, helping America keep a lid on its borrowing costs.\n\nCarney and Potter do see eye-to-eye on one point: policy makers should keep control of the currency system. While Facebook\u2019s Libra could lie outside the purview of central banks, Carney argued in August that the public sector would be the best provider of a new currency hegemony.\n\nPotter agrees. While it\u2019s unlikely that \u201cindividual sovereigns could ever coordinate\u201d around a virtual currency, the risk is that companies might.\n\n\u201cCentral banks should be very concerned about the private sector doing this,\u201d Potter said. A nation\u2019s control of its currency \u201cis designed to protect people and get good outcomes. The private sector is much more interested in selling products.\u201d", "description": "Ex-Fed Official Takes Aim at Bank of England\u2019s Crypto Proposal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pica00f41b4e70c488df367782adf61cd84.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
