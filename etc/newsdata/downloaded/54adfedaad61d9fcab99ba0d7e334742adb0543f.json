The only guys that have beaten him are AJ McKee, Cody Garbrandt and Shawn Bunch and I wanted to join those reputable names that have beaten him, so I wasn\u2019t too mad at it. I would have liked a step up as opposed to a step back but you know with him pulling out now, I have Isaiah Chapman.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got all the opportunity in the world to come out here and take the hype from me so I have to hold my ground and basically take him out so he can\u2019t touch what I have.\u201d\n\nMix (11-0 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) made his mark in his Bellator debut, when he took out fellow 135-pound prospect Ricky Bandejas in the first round at Bellator 222. While Chapman wasn\u2019t the name he was necessarily looking for, he believes a win propels him forward regardless, as his resume speaks for itself.\n\n\u201cI feel with a win here, a finish here, I\u2019m 12-0 with nine finishes and my record, there\u2019s no other undefeated guys in this bantamweight division at all, and there\u2019s no other guys with this record and these credentials,\u201d Mix said. \u201cI\u2019ve never even lost a round, so I\u2019m on a 22-fight win streak, I\u2019ve never lost a round, so I need these big names, and I need to dispatch these top contenders if I want to get at Horiguchi so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the belt,\u201d Mix added. \u201cI want to be the first to ever bring the title belt to Jackson-Wink and that\u2019s my goal. I want to bring a world title home.\u201d", "description": "Patrick Mix believes if he keeps putting on impressive performances, he will eventually get his shot at the title.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/patrick-mix-bellator-232-pre.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
