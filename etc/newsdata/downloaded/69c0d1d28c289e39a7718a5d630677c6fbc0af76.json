The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star stripped down to her underwear in two Instagram pictures that she shared for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and the entire internet is talking about her six pack.\n\nIn the first photo, the 56-year-old snapped a mirror selfie in her closet, where you get a full shot of her sculpted abs. Is she flexing? Maybe, but who the heck cares because the reality star looks so toned. \"\ud83d\udc95 Both my Mom and my sister are breast cancer survivors. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb take a mirror selfie in your @thekitundergarments \ud83d\udc9eproceeds go to @wcrfcure,\" she captioned the photo.\n\nRinna, who is wearing The Kit bra and undies, partnered with the garment company for their #KitstoKickCancer initiative, which donates money for each Insta selfie to the Women's Cancer Research Fund, an organization that funds research aimed at improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of women's cancers.\n\nIn a followup post, Rinna had someone snap another photo of her in the adorable pink set where you can see her toned arms and abs. The RHOBH star is rocking her signature bob and a fierce pair of oversized sunglasses.\n\n\"I said to founder @sweetbabyjamie Give me a reason to pose half naked for a good cause......Hunny! \ud83c\udf38 @thekitundergarments @wcrfcure #breastcancerawarenessmonth #KitsToKickCancer\" she captioned the photo.\n\nNaturally, everyone is freaking out over Rinna's toned figure, specifically her sculpted abs. After a number of comments that read \"Beautiful \ud83d\udd25, LEGEND, \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25, and Gorgeous \ud83d\ude18,\" Rinna's fans were also grateful that she's spreading awareness about breast cancer during October.\n\n\"Breast cancer survivor here. Thanks for the awareness. \ud83d\udc97\" one follower wrote, while another commented, \"very impressed by your dedication to stay healthy & stay on top \ud83d\ude4c.\"\n\nRinna recently got a mammogram with fellow RHOBH cast member Kyle Richards, who also lost her mom to breast cancer in 2002. Though they were both in the clear, the reality stars hoped that by airing their mammograms on the show, they would bring awareness to the importance of early detection with regular screenings.\n\n\"I lost my Mom to Breast cancer in 2002. The fact that she hadn\u2019t had a mammogram in 5 years haunts me. I really wanted to show this to bring awareness re early detection and as a reminder to get checked #rhobh\" Richards tweeted.\n\nI lost my Mom to Breast cancer in 2002.

It keeps me balanced and sane. It\u2019s really good to move every day.\u201d\n\nShe also eats mostly plant-based. \u201cI tend to call myself a dirty vegan. I\u2019m mostly plant-based\u2014but if I do need to eat some meat, I\u2019ll have it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t love to use the word diet because if I do, I\u2019ll just want to eat 10 times more. Moderation is key.\u201d\n\nThroughout the years, Rinna has developed an exercise and nutrition routine that works for her. \u201cI\u2019ve been my own dietician and workout therapist for years,\u201d she told People. \u201cI think you have to listen to your body.\u201d\n\nLike what you just read?
