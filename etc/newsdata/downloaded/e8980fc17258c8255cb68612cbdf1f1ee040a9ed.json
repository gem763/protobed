He added that it didn\u2019t bother him that athletes weren\u2019t getting a cut from things like jersey sales.\n\nLEBRON JAMES SAYS CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE ATHLETES COMPENSATION LAW 'PERSONAL' FOR HIM\n\n\u201cYou go to school in order to get an education,\u201d Holtz said. \u201cWhy do schools even have sports? Because you learn so much from sports. You learn about adversity, you learn about getting along with other people, you\u2019re learning about teamwork and being unselfish. All these qualities will carry over. You ask almost everyone who ever played athletics how much they learned and that\u2019s why we have them. We don\u2019t have them for money.\"\n\nHoltz said the money is already going toward things college athletes already use like training facilities, workout areas, food and training tables.\n\nWhen asked whether he agrees it is difficult for college athletes to use the education they\u2019re receiving because there are limits around classroom scheduling, the College Football Hall of Famer said the NCAA also puts limits on practice time and came up with a compromise.\n\nNCAA NEEDS DEFENSIVE PLAN AS 3 MORE STATES LOOK TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE ATHLETES PAY LAW\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s do a compromise?'\u201d he asked. \u201cThe athlete, Justin Fields, you\u2019re a great quarterback. We\u2019re selling your jersey. What we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to take that money and we\u2019re going to give it to student scholarships. We\u2019re going to have four students going on a full scholarship in the name of Justin Fields scholarship, for example.\n\n\u201cI just think we cannot get in this thing of paying somebody.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s law will go into effect in 2023 and does not apply to community college and bans athletes from accepting endorsement deals that conflict with their school's existing contracts.\n\nThe NCAA, Pac-12 and SEC have all spoken out against the law.\n\nMembership in the NCAA, the top governing body for college sports, is voluntary. Athletes can get valuable scholarships, but the NCAA has long banned paying athletes to preserve the academic missions of colleges and universities.\n\nThe debate over paying college athletes has raged in recent years as some schools rake in millions from their athletic programs -- mostly from football and basketball. Many college basketball athletes have left school early to sign lucrative NBA contracts.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe league now requires players to be at least one year removed from high school before entering the draft.\n\nThe NCAA has a history of coming down hard on players for receiving compensation or gifts of any kind.", "description": "Legendary college football coach Lou Holtz took issue Wednesday with California passing a law allowing college athletes to earn a profit from their names, images and likenesses.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
