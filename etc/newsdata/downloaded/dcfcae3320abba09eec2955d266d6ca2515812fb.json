In 2013, they celebrated their wedding there with a performance by Grammy-award winning musician Lionel Richie. Then they decided to build their dream home on the beach.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe felt close to Miami and imagined building our dream home and raising our children forever in it,\u201d Mr. Carr said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta Mark Rothko\u2019s \u2018Blue Over Red\u2019 Could Top $25 Million\n\nHe and Ms. Carr purchased an approximately 0.4-acre property on Palm Island for $6.5 million in September 2014. They commissioned famed local architectural firm Choeff Levy Fischman to build a tropical modernist home, which typically combines the clean lines and muted color palette of contemporary design with exotic woods and stone.\n\n\n\nThe two-story, 9,600-square-foot residence was completed in 2018.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe watched the house grow from the ground up to the beautiful home it became,\u201d Mrs. Carr said. \u201cWe were most proud of our high-end finishes and the beautiful atrium.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe open-air atrium is a focal point of the residence. It spans 460 square feet with floating steps that lead to a shallow pool of water.\n\n\n\nWater features are spread out throughout the property, though. The private driveway boasts a colossal water cascade, there are reflecting ponds and an infinity-edge pool around the sides of the residence, which itself sits on 110-foot water frontage.\n\n\n\nHigh-end finishes include its gray limestone exteriors, a floor-to-ceiling gas fireplace with bespoke brass paneling, a central $500,000 gourmet kitchen by Fendi with chocolate lacquer floor-to-ceiling cabinetry and champagne leather paneling, and an Ipe wood staircase with a unique Italian tile wall, among other things.\n\n\n\nThe house has six bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, and an open-concept living room with 12-foot ceilings and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors that open up to the rear deck.\n\n\n\nThe master bedroom suite on the second floor has 1,490 square feet of livable space, overlooking Biscayne Bay on one side and the glass atrium on the opposite end. It includes a lounge, a fireplace, and two spacious bathrooms featuring exotic floor-to-ceiling marble and a seamless glass zero-edge spa shower.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur favorite space was our outdoor living space that we really enjoyed with family and friends, and our movie theater where we actually spent more family time,\u201d Mrs. Carr said.\n\n\n\nMore: Accessorize Your Living Room With Stylish Accents\n\nAdditional amenities include a fully integrated Savant home automation technology system, one of the largest residential-grade elevators, serving three levels, a private rooftop and a motor court with a British-made automobile rotating turntable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rotating turntable, one of the only two in Miami Beach, is inspired by houses in the South of France,\u201d said Dina Goldentayer of Douglas Elliman, who is listing the property Wednesday.\n\n\n\nPalm Island is a prestigious, gated residential community five minutes from both South Beach and downtown Miami, Ms. Goldentayer said.\n\n\n\nThe Carrs decided to sell the house because they\u2019ve moved to Monaco, where they wanted to raise their two young children, Mrs. Carr said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120024?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
