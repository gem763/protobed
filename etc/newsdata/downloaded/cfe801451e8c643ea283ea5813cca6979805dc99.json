Record signing Tanguy Ndombele has been one of the positives of the rocky start to the season and both fans and players are desperate to see some more new blood.\n\nLo Celso and Sessegnon may need time to adjust to Spurs and the Premier League, and their return to fitness offers no guarantees of an upturn in fortunes. But a couple of fresh faces will lift the fans and may just put a spring back in the step of everybody in and around the club. The addition of those two players may also bring about an element of surprise for the opposition, who are currently finding it too easy to set up to face Tottenham\u2019s familiar old faces.\n\nTanguy Ndombele has been one of the brightest aspects of this season for Spurs Credit: Getty Images\n\nSpell out the new project\n\nPochettino once again referenced the need to open a new chapter and settle on a medium or long-term project following the thrashing by Bayern Munich. But it is October now and does anybody really know what the new project is? Do the players know whether or not they are at a club that believes they should be fighting for titles or is slowly hitting the reset button?\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes Pochettino himself have a clear idea of where Daniel Levy is realistically going to take Spurs - or how? Does Levy even know what is achievable with the current squad and the inferior budget to Tottenham\u2019s top-six rivals? There are far too many questions surrounding just what exactly Spurs are striving for and everybody needs some answers. Only then can proper solutions be found.\n\nMove on from the Champions League final\n\nIt is hard to speak to Pochettino or a Tottenham player before eventually getting around to the hurt of losing the Champions League final. That is, of course, partly down to the line of questioning from reporters, but the manager and his players now need to move on.\n\nIt was, of course, a superb achievement to reach the final against all the odds, but it no longer matters. Finalists are largely forgotten about and winners are remembered. Spurs have a long tradition of celebrating glorious failure, but if they ever want to be real champions then they need to concentrate on what is in front of them, rather than the near misses - however big.\n\nGive Alli a run of games\n\nDele Alli made only his third start of the season against Bayern Munich, so it should be of no great surprise that he was not at his very best. Dipping him in for a Colchester United here and a Bayern Munich there makes it difficult for the 23-year-old to build any sort of match fitness and rhythm.\n\nDele Alli is struggling without a run of games Credit: Getty images\n\nInjuries have undoubtedly disrupted Dele\u2019s progress since Pochettino described him as being the best 21-year-old in world football. There have been flashes, such as the brilliant impact he made in Tottenham\u2019s Champions League semi-final comeback against Ajax, but the big moments have become more infrequent.\n\nThe talent is still there, but it needs bringing out again and Dele looks like he needs an arm around the shoulder. With all the talk of the players whose Tottenham futures are in doubt, Alli only signed a six-year contract 12 months ago so his commitment cannot be questioned.\n\nForce a new era\n\nTottenham\u2019s players continue to insist that their poor results and inconsistent performances have nothing to do with the futures of so many of them being unclear, but Pochettino must focus on the players who genuinely want to play for the club and those he sees as being at the club for years to come.\n\nDavinson Sanchez should be given more game time Credit: Getty Images\n\nDavinson Sanchez may not have been in top form at the beginning of this season, but he should now be starting the big games as the contracts of both Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen run down. Similarly, there appears to be increasingly less value in sticking with Serge Aurier, a player who admitted he wanted to leave during the summer, at right-back, even though Pochettino is short of options.\n\nThe Argentine\u2019s hands may have been tied to some degree by Daniel Levy\u2019s questionable approach to the transfer window, but he still has the power to force greater change through his selections.", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino called his Tottenham Hotspur players in to sit through watching back their Bayern Munich horror show on Wednesday as work began on how to stop the season derailing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WQcvkqsGZKpLZHerOWutQw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r1YC.LWRYL7teNgF9dNK4w--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/876b2044c810625f4ab91dbc763bacdc"}
