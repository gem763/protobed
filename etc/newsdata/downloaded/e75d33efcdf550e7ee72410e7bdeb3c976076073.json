A three-judge panel in that court had ruled that 34 state legislative and congressional districts needed to be redrawn because they were designed to favor Republicans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe League of Women Voters and a group of Michigan voters had argued that GOP officials in the state had \"engaged in a concerted effort to redraw district lines to benefit Republican candidates while disadvantaging their opponents.\"\n\nThe three-judge district court panel agreed, writing, \"Federal courts\u2019 failure to protect marginalized voters\u2019 constitutional rights will only increase the citizenry\u2019s growing disenchantment with, and disillusionment in, our democracy, further weaken our democratic institutions, and threaten the credibility of the judicial branch.\"\n\nThe case had been put on hold by the Supreme Court as it considered similar challenges in Maryland and North Carolina, which led to the sweeping decision earlier this year and all but guaranteed that the challenge in Michigan would fail.\n\nThe decision in June was decided by the court\u2019s 5-4 majority of Republican-appointed justices. Their opinion, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, argued that questions about redistricting should be left to politicians and not federal judges.\n\n\"Excessive partisanship in districting leads to results that reasonably seem unjust. But the fact that such gerrymandering is 'incompatible with democratic principles,' does not mean that the solution lies with the federal judiciary,\" Roberts wrote in the decision.\n\n\"We conclude that partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts. Federal judges have no license to reallocate political power between the two major political parties, with no plausible grant of authority in the Constitution, and no legal standards to limit and direct their decisions.\"\n\nIn the cases, Democrats in North Carolina had challenged congressional districts which were drawn by Republicans. In the Maryland case, Republicans claimed that Democrats in their state had politically drawn the district maps to eliminate a GOP seat.\n\nIn their dissent, the four liberal justices accused their colleagues of abdicating the court\u2019s responsibility of safeguarding the democratic process.\n\n\u201cThese gerrymanders enabled politicians to entrench themselves in office as against voters\u2019 preferences,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThey promoted partisanship above respect for the popular will. They encouraged a politics of polarization and dysfunction. If left unchecked, gerrymanders like the ones here may irreparably damage our system of government.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling that federal courts cannot weigh in on partisan gerrymandering cases was blasted by activists, who have sought to advance their fight against politically-drawn maps in the courts.\n\nFormer Obama Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderSupreme Court throws out challenge to Michigan electoral map Amash: Trump incorrect in claiming Congress didn't subpoena Obama officials We can't allow presidents and public opinion to further diminish the work of the press MORE, chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, at the time called the decision one which \"tears at the fabric of our democracy.\"\n\n--Updated at 2:57 p.m.", "description": "The Supreme Court, in another defeat for gerrymandering reformers, overturned a lower court's ruling that Michigan's electoral districts are overly partisan and need to be redrawn.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/scotus_supremecourt_012219gn12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
