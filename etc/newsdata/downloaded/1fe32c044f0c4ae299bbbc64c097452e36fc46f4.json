Mainly families \u2014 small kids, women, husbands,\" Smith told As It Happens host Carol Off.\n\n\"I think a lot of them were traumatized because of the experience.

(Ramon Espinosa/The Associated Press)\n\nDorian was losing strength on Tuesday as it churned closer to the Florida coast. It has been downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nBut it was raging strong when it battered the Bahamas on Monday. The most powerful storm to ever hit the islands destroyed tens of thousands of homes, caused at least five deaths, and left catastrophic flooding in its wake.\n\nSmith first set out on his personal water craft to rescue one of his friends who was stranded with his family. But once he arrived on the scene, his friend immediately started telling him about others in need.\n\nSoon enough, he and his friends were out on the flooded streets rescuing people full time, he said.\n\nWord has got out about what they're doing, and he said he's received over 200 phone calls and WhatsApp messages from folks in need.\n\nA woman walks in a flooded street after the effects of Hurricane Dorian arrived in Nassau, Bahamas.

They've helped elderly people, small children, people with medical needs and a pregnant woman.\n\n\"I am seeing a lot of destroyed homes,\" he said. \"The rain feels like small pebbles just kind of pounding at you.\"\n\nSmith and his friends are just a handful of the people in the Bahamas taking rescue operations into their own hands.\n\nThe Bahamas government on Tuesday sent out an \"urgent plea\" for residents with small boats, water scooters, flatbed trucks and buses to join the rescue effort\n\n\"We're resilient in that we know that our country's resources are limited. So I could say that the average citizen, a lot of people, kind of chip in and help with assisting people,\" Smith said.\n\n\"Fortunately, we do have a lot of expertise in these types of disasters.\"\n\nSubmerged car sit submerged in water from Hurricane Dorian in Freeport.

I was out all day yesterday,\" he said. \"I'm going give my wife a heart attack if I keep at it.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press.
