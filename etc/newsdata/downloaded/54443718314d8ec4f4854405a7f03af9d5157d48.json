My focus is on the job at hand focused on safety. And we\u2019re going to do everything we can to ensure safe flight.\u201d\n\nBut Nadia Milleron, who lost her daughter on the Ethiopian Airlines crash, said the company needs a shakeup.\n\nMuilenburg \u201cneeds to resign. The whole board needs to resign,\u201d she said. \u201cI expect him to stop putting the blame on the FAA and other people because that is what they always do. They don\u2019t take responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Passing the buck? \u2013\n\nMany of the questions focused on the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, an automated system that Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines pilots were unable to control, resulting in crashes.\n\n\u201cWe have learned from both accidents and we\u2019ve identified changes that need to be made to MCAS,\u201d Muilenburg told the Senate Commerce Committee.\n\nBut Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, lambasted Muilenburg as he struggled to answer pointed questions about 2016 texts from Boeing pilot Mark Forkner to a colleague that discussed the \u201cegregious\u201d performance of the MCAS during a simulation test and said that he \u201cbasically lied to the regulators.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg indicated that Boeing counsel shared the documents with the Justice Department in February, but that he did not see the specific exchange until it was reported by news media earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI was made aware of existence of this kind of document,\u201d Muilenburg told Cruz. \u201cI counted on counsel to handle this appropriately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is passive voice,\u201d Cruz shot back. \u201cYou\u2019re the CEO, the buck stops with you.\n\n\u201cHow did your team not put it in front of you, run with their hair on fire and say \u2018We have a real problem here?\u2019 How did that not happen and what does that say about the culture at Boeing?\u201d\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state where the 737 MAX is built, said the crisis showed that Boeing leadership was failing its employees.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a question about line workers \u2014 this is a question about the corporate view from Chicago, and whether there is enough attention to manufacturing and certification,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cYou should take offense to the fact that people say, \u2018It\u2019s a great company that\u2019s not being run correctly.\u2019\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing will be followed by a second session on Wednesday in the House Transportation Committee.\n\nBoeing is still targeting regulatory approval for the MAX in 2019, a timeframe that many aviation experts still view as possible.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate committee, told CNBC before the hearing that he intends to scrutinize Boeing\u2019s processes but said he did not see anything that would prevent the MAX from going back into service \u201cfairly soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this plane is eminently fixable,\u201d Wicker told CNBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hopeless cause.\u201d", "description": "Senators from both parties signaled clear dissatisfaction, bordering on rage in some cases.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/def5ba_family-members-who-died-aboard-ethiopian-airlines-flight-302-hold-photographs-e1572376317388-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
