Though the film came and went without much fanfare (beyond a hefty worldwide gross of $758m), it\u2019s remained one of the stronger entries in the studio\u2019s ever-expanding line of live-action remakes. Its characters felt genuine. So, too, did its underlying message.\n\nA sly feminist makeover of Sleeping Beauty, the film posited that its villain wasn\u2019t much of a villain at all, but a woman whose trust had been violated in the most destructive of ways. Once upon a time, it began, Maleficent was a fairy whose wings had been cut from her back by an old lover \u2013 in a scene that dealt allegorically with sexual assault, without crossing the line into anything distasteful. It was a film that spoke to something real, far beyond the world of magic and fairytale.\n\nThe same could be said of its follow-up, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, but only if you\u2019ve got the endurance to sit through the inevitable \u2013 and no less tedious \u2013 attempt to give the character her own superhero style-origin story. It happens far too often with sequels: instead of adding depth to an existing world, they attempt to stretch its horizons as far as possible. All you get in return is a baggy mess of narrative threads.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe film, directed by Joachim R\u00f8nning, starts on a promising note: Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson, replacing Brenton Thwaites) has finally popped the question to Aurora (Elle Fanning). And so, naturally, the boy\u2019s parents \u2013 King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) \u2013 invite Maleficent, who raised Aurora, for a celebratory feast.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc\n\nYet Ingrith has ulterior motives up her voluminous, pearl-encrusted sleeves (Ellen Mirojnick\u2019s costumes here are exquisite). She\u2019s pushing every single one of Maleficent\u2019s buttons: dismissing her fellow fairy folk, while enthusing about the fact Aurora will finally have a real mother. These moments are delicious, dripping with venom and laced with just the right amount of camp. Pfeiffer\u2019s inclusion, in fact, is a small stroke of genius. She\u2019s an ideal sparring partner for Jolie, who flexes so magnificently in her return as Maleficent, giving her character a half-thawed heart and a haughty elegance.\n\nThe clash between these women would have been enough to carry the film, though it helps that many of the performances here are so strong \u2013 Fanning is angelic, while Sam Riley and Jenn Murray have fun with what they\u2019re given as Maleficent\u2019s exasperated bird-man sidekick and Ingrith\u2019s steely commander.\n\nWas anyone ever interested in where Maleficent came from, though? Mistress of Evil certainly seems to think so, as the film takes a sudden dive into the rough, wild lands of endless exposition. She meets the dark fae \u2013 an exiled community whose entire vibe screams \u201cJames Cameron\u2019s Avatar\u201d \u2013 and is forced to listen as Chiwetel Ejiofor\u2019s Conall drones on about their history. You discover how they connect to Maleficent\u2019s past.\n\nIt\u2019s this plot that ends up gobbling up much of the film\u2019s running time, as it throws out character development in favour of gratuitous worldbuilding and a CGI-laden, bloated battle sequence. In the end, both Pfeiffer and Jolie\u2019s talents end up going to waste. Maleficent may have offered a sharp, original take on a well-worn story, but its sequel just feels like more fantasy fluff.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil is out in UK cinemas on Friday 18 October", "description": "It\u2019s been five years since Angelina Jolie strapped on a pair of horns and scowled her way through Disney\u2019s Maleficent.
