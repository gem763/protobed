These brave women and men saved lives \u2014 and if not for their quick action, we know the destruction would have been much worse.\"\n\nAt least one death has been attributed to the Saddleridge fire, a man who authorities said suffered a heart attack while trying to fight encroaching flames on his property rather than heeding evacuation orders.\n\nTwo firefighters suffered minor injuries, the LAFD said, and 31 structures have been either damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe cause of the blaze was under investigation.\n\nThe Saddleridge is the largest among a spate of wildfires across Southern California.\n\nOn Saturday, authorities said the 820-acre Sandalwood Fire in Riverside County, about 70 miles (110 km) east of the Saddleridge fire, was 25% contained, up from 10% on Friday.\n\nThe Sandalwood Fire has killed at least two people: one was an 89-year-old woman and the other has not yet been identified, according to Riverside Deputy Sheriff Robyn Flores.\n\nThey were found in separate mobile homes on Thursday and Friday at the Villa Calimesa Mobile Home Park, Flores said.
