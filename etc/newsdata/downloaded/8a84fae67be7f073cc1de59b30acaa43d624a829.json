She is still talking to Arg to support him but doesn't want to get back together as she knows it's toxic.' (pictured together in October 2018)\n\nGemma's face looked noticeably slimmer as she smiled directly at the camera and appeared to be wearing less makeup that usual, opting for a lighter blush.\n\nThe TV star completed her glam look for the dinner with friends by wearing a satin green top over a lacy black ensemble.\n\nIn another picture shared on social media the GC was seen standing at the top of a table next to Billie Faiers' partner Greg Shepherd with her arms out.\n\nWeight loss: The TV star, pictured at the Deliveroo Awards on October 18, has already shed three stone and recently revealed she would like to lose another three by Christmas\n\nGemma look completely contrasted her appearance in recent weeks, when she's stepped out at events including The Deliveroo Awards and her own perfume launch.\n\nAlthough she has lost an impressive amount of weight, some fans have suggested that Gemma has been editing her pictures to make herself look thinner.\n\nLast Thursday some questioned whether the star had posted a Photoshopped image of her wearing an animal print two-piece as they said the floor and skirting boards were 'wonky'.\n\nGroup pic: Greg Shepherd shared a snap from the evening in Dubai with Gemma stood at the head of the table smiling as she held her arms out. He captioned the picture 'Dubz!'\n\nGirls trip: The GC, third right, has shared several glimpses into her Dubai holiday with pals including fellow TOWIE star Billie, 29, second right, who was sporting a sparkly red skirt\n\nOne person wrote: 'I applaud you on your weight loss but photoshopping not only deceives others but ultimately yourself ..\n\n'Skirting board is wonky behind legs and shadow doesn't look right, am I the only one seeing this?'\n\nOthers said it was 'obvious Gemma is deceiving her fans by airbrushing her pictures' and another said 'weight loss of filter'.\n\nHowever stylish Lucas Armitage, who said he took the picture and did the edit, said that he had not changed Gemma's shape in the picture.\n\nEdited? Last week fans claimed Gemma had Photoshopped her Instagram post, with them suggesting the skirting board behind her legs was 'wonky'\n\nGemma has previously spoken about her weight loss using Skinnyjabs, saying: 'I want to lose another three (stone) between now and Christmas. I don't want to be stick thin, I just want to be a lot healthier.'\n\nThis came after the reality star spoke of her plans to have a breast reduction.\n\n'I'd be really happy if I lost six stone as that would bring me down to 12 stone and a size 16,' Gemma told The Sun. 'My boobs are so big and I want to get them reduced in January, but I have to lose three stone before they can operate.'\n\nTo lose the weight, Gemma said she would undergo the injections again, explaining: 'Last time I had them, I didn't eat for four days. Literally nothing.\n\nChanges: Gemma, pictured at the launch of her perfume Diva Pink on October 21, has used \u00a3250 SkinnyJabs in the past, which she said were 'fantastic and really works for me'\n\n'I just didn't have an appetite. You just don't think about food or being hungry. It's fantastic and really works for me.'\n\nOf her breast size, Gemma added: 'My boobs are 38GG now and I think I will go down to a C or a D-cup. The operation is all booked in.\n\n'I think when you have big boobs, they can make you look bigger and I would just love to never ever wear a bra again.'\n\nIt comes after Gemma previously revealed that she only eats two meals a day and that she 'doesn't know why she is overweight'.\n\nHowever the TV personality recently revealed she hasn't stopped eating since she reportedly called 999 over fears her on-off boyfriend James Argent had overdosed.\n\nThe star admitted she was feeling stressed but vowed to bounce back and return to the gym.\n\nGemma told The Sun: 'I ain\u2019t stopped eating. I\u2019ve had a lot of stress and I\u2019ve not been to the gym in two weeks, I\u2019ve been unwell all weekend with a chest infection.\n\n'When I come back, I will get back on it, I always come out on top. My life always goes a bit t*ts-up but I carry on, I\u2019ve got lots of projects on the table, so it\u2019s exciting.'", "description": "And now it has been claimed that the TOWIE star, 38, has\u00a0overhauled her fitness regime and diet by ditching her vegan diet for steaks.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/18/20389704-0-image-a-21_1572459540494.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
