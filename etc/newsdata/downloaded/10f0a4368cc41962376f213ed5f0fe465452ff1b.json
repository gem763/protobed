It\u2019ll take some time.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, Mr. Trump has retained rock-solid support within the GOP, scoring an 85% approval rating among Republicans in a Quinnipiac University poll released this week.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump also won 80% support in a hypothetical primary matchup against Mr. Walsh, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Rep. Mark Sanford.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey was conducted before House Democrats announced they were formalizing their impeachment investigation.
