The US has a higher level of online retail sales \u2013 10 per cent of all sales compared with 6.1 per cent in Australia \u2013 in part due to a denser US population that makes fulfilment of online orders in North America easier than in this country, the CBRE report said.\n\nNew York, for example, has a population density of 28,210 people per sq km, San Francisco is 7170 people per sq km and Miami 4866 people. In contrast, Sydney has just 400 people per sq km, Melbourne 453 people per sq km and Brisbane 145 people, the report says.\n\nAnd in Australia now, sales at retailers that run a multi-channel online retail operation \u2013 in response to changing market demands \u2013 are growing faster than sales of pure-play retailers, the report says.\n\n\u201cMulti-channel retailers have gained an increasing proportion of online sales in the past three years,\u201d CBRE\u2019s Pacific head of retail, Graeme Wakefield, said.\n\n\u201cThis has been driven in part by bricks and mortar retailers adapting to changing consumer preferences by broadening the medium through which they sell goods to avoid losing sales to pure play online retailers.\u201d\n\nLandlords in both countries face evolving challenges, such as balancing the mix of tenancies between shorter term, or entertainment-based operators who draw foot traffic but may not pay as high rents, and stable payers with a track record who were less exciting.\n\nMall retail lease terms are also likely to shorten in both countries, the report says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In Australia and the US, the majority of leases are still of a five-year term; however, shorter lease terms of one to three years are becoming increasingly common in Europe and Asia and are likely to follow in other markets,\" it says.\n\n\"Whilst the shorter term lessens the risk for a retailer, this also presents the landlord with opportunity to capitalise on fast-moving trends.\"", "description": "Australian malls are anchored by supermarkets, not department stores, making them more resilient to disruption, CBRE report says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1932%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_65/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b0bdd7b8b60ee5367d703aa0f669c95cff934059", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
