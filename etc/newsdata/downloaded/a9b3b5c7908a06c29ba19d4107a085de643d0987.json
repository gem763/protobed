Footage shows their newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, arriving in New York for the United Nations General Assembly \u2014 also the venue of his meeting with Trump, whose dealings with Zelensky\u2019s government have enmeshed him in the biggest scandal of his administration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the hosts of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d as the show is called, couldn\u2019t be happier. One of them, Yevgeny Popov, is broadcasting live from New York, where he\u2019s sitting with John Varoli, an American public relations consultant who learned to speak Russian during a stint as a journalist in St. Petersburg a few years ago. When Popov asks him about the president\u2019s prospects in 2020, Varoli replies: \u201cI think his victory is almost guaranteed, because the economy is flourishing and growing. A majority of Americans support him.\u201d Varoli, who hastens to add that he\u2019s not a Trump supporter, doesn\u2019t cite any polls. (Last week, Gallup put Trump\u2019s approval rating at 43 percent.) Varoli continues: \u201cTrump is constantly breaking the law, but Obama also broke the law, Bush broke the law \u2014 all our presidents break the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, what kind of country do you have?\u201d asks Olga Skabeeva, who\u2019s moderating back in the studio in Moscow. \u201cEveryone\u2019s breaking the law!\u201d More applause. Then she takes a turn scolding the Ukrainians.\n\nMake no mistake, the Russians are happy to cheerlead for Trump. \u201cThe president noted that Biden demanded that the government of Ukraine fire the general prosecutor who had been investigating his son,\u201d reports a typical article \u2014 neglecting to mention that no such investigation ever took place. \u201cU.S. media LAUGHING STOCK of the world: Trump accuses \u2018fake news\u2019 of gutting their credibility,\u201d declares an English-language piece on the website of RT, Moscow\u2019s overseas propaganda hub, which has a long history of acting as a Trump stenographer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut those Russian journalists who are still paid by the government have a broader agenda. The tale of the U.S. president\u2019s efforts to pressure Zelensky into delivering kompromat on Democratic front-runner Joe Biden offers a perfect opportunity to convey several messages: The United States is a dystopian mess. Ukraine is a sewer of corruption, a geopolitical nobody. Don\u2019t believe that holier-than-thou crap the Americans are always trying to sell you \u2014 all that talk of democracy and human rights and \u201crule of law\u201d is a crock. Donald Trump pretty much says so, after all.\n\nA lot of the Russian coverage is conspicuous in what it leaves out. You\u2019ll see little analysis of the whistleblower law underlying the complaint that inspired Trump\u2019s latest predicament. You\u2019ll find almost no reporting on the electoral, political or moral dynamics behind impeachment. And you certainly won\u2019t see any efforts to fact-check Trump\u2019s, or Biden\u2019s, or anyone else\u2019s statements.\n\nWhat you will see are conspiracy theories \u2014 such as the broadcast that hints darkly at Biden\u2019s supposed ties with Zelensky\u2019s predecessor, Hunter Biden\u2019s business investments and, for some reason, \u201cthe Malaysian Boeing,\u201d a reference to the civilian airliner that was shot down by a missile over eastern Ukraine in 2014. (Actually, a Dutch investigation found that Moscow, not the Ukrainian government, was almost certainly responsible for the shoot-down.) Whatever causes \u201cmayhem,\u201d as Russian foreign policy commentator and lawmaker Alexei Pushkov noted in a recent tweet, is music to the Kremlin\u2019s ears.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd, as media analyst Julia Davis notes, you will also find plenty of glee over the simple fact that a story of murky dealings in Ukraine is overshadowing the West\u2019s attention to inconvenient topics such as the annexation of Crimea, the war in eastern Ukraine and continuing sanctions against the Kremlin.\n\nIf only we could feel morally superior about all this. But as I perused Russian coverage this week \u2014 with its frenetic talking heads, its souped-up graphics and its breathless, hyperpartisan double talk \u2014 I couldn\u2019t help feeling that I was merely navigating a slightly more feverish version of our own media landscape. And it\u2019s not just that Russian infowarriors love to recycle Fox News talking points \u2014 it\u2019s also the frequent reference, explicit and unstated, to the notion that there are no hard facts anymore, just partisan positions. The truth doesn\u2019t get you any ratings, after all.\n\nThe Russians have learned a lot from us. And perhaps we\u2019ve been learning more from them than we realize.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: The acting director of national intelligence just showed how corrupt the Trump administration is\n\nJennifer Rubin: The \u2018perfect\u2019 call \u2014 and those dense enough to say so\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president\n\nAlexandra Petri: But was it quid pro quo?
