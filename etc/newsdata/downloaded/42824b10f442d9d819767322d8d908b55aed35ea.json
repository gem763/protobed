(\u201cAgraFlora\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (CSE: AGRA) (Frankfurt: PU31) (OTCPK: AGFAF), a growth oriented and diversified international cannabis company, is pleased to announce the Company has received its inaugural purchase order (the \u201cPO\u201d) from its 50 per-cent owned joint venture, Eurasia Infused Cosmetics Inc. (\u201cEurasia Infused\u201d or the \u201cJV\u201d).\n\n\n\nEurasia Infused, by way of a commercial concession with CBD Group Asia Ltd. (\u201cCBD Group Asia\u201d), controls distribution agreements for CBD and organic cannabis sativa seed oil infused consumer packaged goods (\u201cCPGs\u201d), for the territories of People's Republic of China, as well as the Hong Kong special administrative region. This distribution agreement extends to AgraFlora's existing portfolio of CBD-infused and organic cannabis sativa seed oil derived product suite.\n\nHong Kong domiciled CBD Group Asia Ltd., has previously distributed premium Canadian CPGs into China's largest retail chains and C-stores, including RT-Mart International Ltd. (\u201cRT Mart\u201d) and Carrefour SA. RT Mart alone operates over 484 retail locations covering 233 cities and 29 provinces in China and generated $20 billion in sales in 2018.\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the JV issued AgraFlora an initial purchase order to supply its organic cannabis sativa seed oil infused face serum and lip balm. This initial purchase order will secure high-visibility Asia Pacific shelf space for AgraFlora's existing CPG product offering.\n\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, Inc., the Chinese CBD category is estimated to potentially be worth up to $15 billion by the year 20241. Additionally, the global CBD skin care marketplace, including the Asia Pacific regions, is expected to reach $1.7 billion by 2025, expanding at a CAGR of 32.9% over the forecast period.\n\nOver the past 60 calendar days, Agraflora and CBD Group Asia have collaborated on a variety of product customization, branding and distribution initiatives, with the objective of tailoring the Company's product offering for rapid uptake into the Asian CPG markets. The JV\u2019s continuing CPG customization and distribution deliverables, culminating with this initial PO, include the following:\n\nBrand testing, focus groups and data mining initiatives;\n\nSuccessful YuShop Global (HK) Ltd. product listings for CBD-infused CPGs: Active user footprint of over 500 million consumers; and Permits immediate access to China/Hong Kong's burgeoning CBD-infused CPG marketplaces;\n\nNational CPG listings, leveraging CBD Group Asia's high-traffic distribution channels,=including the introduction of high-traffic retail channel partners, as well as 1,500 luxury health spas;\n\nOrganic cannabis sativa certificate of analysis (\u201cCOA\u201d) authorization;\n\nProduct and packaging customization;\n\nDevelopment of a full-spectrum CBD facial serum, infused with hemp root oil;\n\nInitial three SKUs fully customized/import certified for the Chinese/Hong Kong marketplaces packaged for shipment from the Company's co-packer to fulfill POs;\n\nArchitecture of a network of Chinese Canutra/Whole Hemp Health-branded pop-up shops, further expanding the Company's retail footprint and brand presence in an economical and contemporary manner; and\n\nIntegration into CBD Group Asia's proprietary direct to customer Asian sales WeChat platform providing unencumbered daily access to 1.08 billion current WeChat customers.\n\nBrandon Boddy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AgraFlora stated: \u201cAsia is a largely untapped CBD marketplace and represents the next enormous market opportunity to benefit from the global secular trend towards the legalisation of cannabis. In an expeditious manner our JV with CBD Group Asia has allowed us to penetrate this growth-based marketplace with our existing suite of premium cannabinoid-infused CPGs and realize top line revenues.\u201d\n\nThe JV is positioned to capitalize on current and future market trends in the rapidly expanding global cannabinoid-infused CPG space. Existing turnkey cultivation/manufacturing capabilities further bolster the Eurasia Infused\u2019s ability to swiftly expand the breadth of its current product line to more than 40 SKUs. Eurasia Infused is finalizing the development phase of a suite of innovative SKUs, specifically tailored of the Asia Pacific theatre, including:\n\nOrganic infused cosmetics with anti-aging properties;\n\nCBD tinctures;\n\nCBD capsules; and\n\nCBD-infused candies.\n\nThe JV will work to integrate Cannessence, AgraFlora\u2019s recently announced terpene-infused, organic cannabis sativa seed oil formulation, into its distribution channels. Cannessence when coupled with organic cannabis sativa seed oil, will boast a uniquely formulated terpene profile resulting in amplification of the activation of the endocannabinoid system (the \u201cECS\u201d), optimization of cannabinoid uptake and standardization of pharmacological effects within the ECS of both humans and pets.\n\nEurasia Infused anticipates that it will market its Cannessence product portfolio in capsule, topical and tincture format and aims to position Cannessence within the marketplace as an over-the-counter (OTC) substitute to conventional CBD.\n\n____________\n\n1 https://www.healtheuropa.eu/asia-pacific-cannabis-markets/93798/\n\nAbout AgraFlora Organics International Inc.\n\nAgraFlora Organics International Inc. is a growth oriented and diversified company focused on the international cannabis industry.
