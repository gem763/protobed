Prosecutors are arguing that some prison time is the way to send a strong message that admission spots at prestigious U.S. universities can\u2019t be bought and have proposed ways of calculating loss.\n\nThe government is asking for one to 15 months of imprisonment for the 11 parents set to be sentenced in the coming weeks, including actress Felicity Huffman on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis was a massive nationwide fraud case fueled through bribery, fraud and corruption,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen told the judge.\n\nFrom WSJ Archives\n\n\u201cOperation Varsity Blues,\u201d announced in March and resulting in criminal charges against 51 people, enraged a public that suspects admission to top U.S. colleges are rigged in favor of the well-connected. Prosecutors suggest every teen admitted through fraud stole an opportunity from a deserving student.\n\nIn a sign of what\u2019s at stake\u2014prison time or none\u2014defense lawyers for the 15 parents who have pleaded guilty and for the 19 who haven\u2019t admitted guilt filled the gallery of Courtroom Nine, spilling into the empty jury box. Other lawyers dialed into a conference line, though none spoke during the hearing.\n\nA more lenient ruling by the judge could prompt more parents to plead guilty, defense lawyers said, while others might decide to try to clear their names at trial, figuring a light punishment is the worst outcome.\n\nJudge Talwani gave no clear sign of how she\u2019ll rule, but she didn\u2019t reschedule Ms. Huffman\u2019s sentencing currently on the calendar for Friday, suggesting a decision could come soon. She asked a series of often technical questions and indicated that a public airing of the legal dispute was a good thing.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing represented a public clash that has dogged the largest college-admissions scandal ever prosecuted by the Justice Department: Who are the financial victims, and how should the length of any prison terms be decided?\n\nDetermining appropriate punishments is complex. Sentencing in federal fraud cases are typically calculated based on direct financial impact, either as loss for the victim or gain for the perpetrator. In plea agreements, the government considered the amounts parents paid to admitted scheme mastermind William \u201cRick\u201d Singer as a proxy for loss, while also taking into account factors such as how actively parents participated or involved their children.\n\nThat means prosecutors are recommending one month of incarceration for Ms. Huffman, a sentence at the low end of the zero-to-six-month range. The \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime\u201d actress has admitted to paying Mr. Singer $15,000 to fix her daughter\u2019s SAT score.\n\nBut they are asking for substantially more prison time for some other parents, based on the amounts they admitted to shelling out to Mr. Singer.\n\nProsecutors say victims include the affected colleges, including the University of Southern California and Georgetown University, and standardized testing agencies. Colleges have been sued, have had to revamp policies and conduct costly internal investigations, they said.\n\n\u201cAll these events I talked about cost money,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cMoney that came out of the victims\u2019 pockets.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What should the punishment, if any, be for parents who cheated to get their children into college? Join the conversation below.\n\nProbation officials, who prepare influential sentencing recommendations for the court, have so far found that the parents\u2019 conduct caused no clear pecuniary harm, according to a recent memo filed by Mr. Rosen.\n\nIn a filing Monday, the lawyer for one parent who has pleaded guilty called the losses alleged by the government either nonexistent or speculative.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com", "description": "A federal judge prolonged the suspense Tuesday over whether parents who have admitted to cheating to get their children into college will serve time in jail, deciding not to rule following a hearing on sentencing guidelines.", "authors": ["Jennifer Levitz", "Jennifer.Levitz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105887/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
