But, as things turned out, it also led to a dramatic drop in the average quality of projects that human reviewers would see. No more crowd-pleasers such as Potato Salad; just dreary projects such as impractically heavy duvets and questionable anime games.\n\nWhen people talk about the effects of automation and artificial intelligence on the economy, they often fixate on the quantity of human workers. Will robots take our jobs? Others focus instead on threats to the quality of employment\u2014the replacement of middle-class occupations with lower-skill, lower-wage ones; the steady elimination of human discretion as algorithms order around warehouse pickers, ride-hailing drivers, and other workers.\n\nWhat\u2019s less understood is that artificial intelligence will transform higher-skill positions, too\u2014in ways that demand more human judgment rather than less. And that could be a problem. As AI gets better at performing the routine tasks traditionally done by humans, only the hardest ones will be left for us to do. But wrestling with only difficult decisions all day long is stressful and unpleasant. Being able to make at least some easy calls, such as allowing Santorini onto Kickstarter, can be deeply satisfying.\n\n\u201cDecision making is very cognitively draining,\u201d the author and former clinical psychologist Alice Boyes told me via email, \u201cso it\u2019s nice to have some tasks that provide a sense of accomplishment but just require getting it done and repeating what you know, rather than everything needing very taxing novel decision making.\u201d\n\nThat people \u201cneed both experiences of mastery and pleasure for healthy mood,\u201d Boyes said, is a core idea of cognitive-behavioral psychology. It\u2019s important, she said, \u201cto vary the difficulty of the mastery experiences, rather than having everything be super challenging.\u201d\n\nAt Kickstarter, our robot picked off the projects that were clearly the easiest to analyze. Left for human reviewers were projects with muddier scores\u2014particularly ones for ideas that tested the limits of our guidelines, such as projects for helmets (Kickstarter prohibits medical devices) or overly optimistic gadgets (Kickstarter also banned hyperrealistic 3-D renderings of technology that didn\u2019t exist yet). Staffers who had been used to reviewing slam-dunk proposals were no longer seeing them. Their jobs weren\u2019t quite as enjoyable as they had been.", "description": "As AI gets better at performing routine tasks traditionally done by humans, only stressful ones will be left.
