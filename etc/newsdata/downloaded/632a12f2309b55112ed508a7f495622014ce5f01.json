We think we're close to an area\" where the missing person might be, but \"we do not have confirmation.\"\n\nCity leaders were also concerned about rain possibly hampering rescue efforts and causing the structure to further collapse.\n\nMcConnell said the evacuation zone was slighted widened in response to the vulnerable cranes, as workers continue to move with search dogs through the unstable structure.\n\n\"The crane that looks damaged, we've known about,\" he told reporters. \"The engineers determined that the other crane is just as risky.\"\n\nCollin Arnold, the city's Homeland Security director, said experts have been called in to help stabilize the structure and cranes.\n\n\"These cranes are both in a bad situation,\" he said. \"We have great minds here and a lot of equipment coming in. It's just going to be a matter of time before we can figure out a game plan.\"\n\nAt least 30 people were hospitalized and two people were killed after Saturday's collapse. More than 100 people were working on the construction site near the French Quarter when the building gave way.\n\nLarge sections of the area near the damaged site remained closed to pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Mayor LaToya Cantrell said utilities were cut off to nine major businesses in the area and 37 families have been put up at hotels.\n\nShe said the city will cooperate with an Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OHSA) investigation into what went wrong.\n\n\"We're going to be as cooperative as necessary, to the fullest extent,\" Cantrell said Monday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Rescue\u00a0crews in New Orleans were still searching for a missing worker\u00a0in the area where a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino building under construction partially collapsed and expressed concerns about two heavily damaged cranes that were in danger of falling down, officials said Monday.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19285716527033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
