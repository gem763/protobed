One of your founders, Roger Hallam, said in April, \u2018Our children are going to die in the next ten or twenty years.\u2019 What\u2019s the scientific basis for these claims?\u201d Neil asked.\n\n\u201cSo, these claims have been disputed, admittedly,\u201d Ms. Lights replied. \u201cThere are some scientists agreeing and some scientists saying they\u2019re simply not true but the overall issue is that these deaths are going to happen. We don\u2019t know exact numbers and actually it\u2019s a little bit concerning to focus on just how many deaths. There will be deaths and suffering and any amount is enough as far as we are concerned.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nBut billions of people dying, \u201cI don\u2019t know where the scientific validity comes for that. How would they die?\u201d Neil pressed.\n\n\u201cMass migration around the world already taking place due to prolonged drought in countries, particularly in South Asia, wildfires in Indonesia, the Amazon rain forest, Siberia, you know, the arctic\u2026\u201d Lights said.\n\n\u201cThese are all really important problems and they can cause fatalities, but they don\u2019t cause billions of deaths. They don\u2019t mean our young people will all be dead in twenty years,\u201d Neil said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps not in twenty years,\u201d Lights conceded.\n\n\u201cYou talk weather-related disasters. There seem to be a lot of them around at the moment and people die from them,\u201d Neil said. \u201cBut in the latest figures I\u2019ve seen, 100 years ago weather-related disasters killed half a million people a year. Today\u2019s it\u2019s 20,000 a year. It\u2019s still 20,000 too many but it\u2019s a reduction of 95 percent. It does not lead to the death of billions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re scaring people with this rhetoric, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a danger of scaring people simply because we\u2019re not taking it seriously enough and people are feeling really desperate that we\u2019re heard on this and unfortunately, alarmist language works,\u201d Lights said.\n\n\u201cBut does it work?\u201d Neil asked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen young girls on television crying because they think they\u2019re going to die in five or six years time, crying because they don\u2019t think they will ever see adulthood, and yet there is no scientific basis for the claims that your organization is making.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeather extremes may be on a downward trajectory but scientists are telling us that they will be on the increase,\u201d Lights later declared.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using language that we feel is appropriate to the situation,\u201d she said.\n\nNeil noted that one critic of efforts to reach a target of zero carbon emissions by 2030 has said that \u201cit would mean the confiscation of petrol cars, state rationing of meat, and limiting families to one flight every five years. Do you agree with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree that we need to do whatever it takes to bring emissions down, to allow young people to have a future, to be able to have some hope for the future,\u201d Lights said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said the group makes unsubstantiated predictions of climate deaths because \u201calarmist language works.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas D.
