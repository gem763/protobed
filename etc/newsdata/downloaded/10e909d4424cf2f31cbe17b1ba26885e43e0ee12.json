Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cI wanna make sure that I\u2019m safe out there, and that, you know, I\u2019m not gonna die,\u201d Darnold told reporters Thursday with a light laugh.\n\nDarnold has yet to be cleared for contact due to an enlarged spleen, a common side effect of mono. He will receive an ultrasound and blood tests on Friday to determine whether it\u2019s safe enough for him to play Sunday or whether the risk of a ruptured spleen is too great.\n\n\u2014Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs added more fuel to the speculation that he wants to be traded.\n\n\u201cI feel like there\u2019s truth to all rumors, no matter how you dress it up,\u201d the 25-year-old Diggs told reporters. \u201cI won\u2019t be speaking on it at all, but there is truth to all rumors, I guess.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Diggs elected to circle back to detailing his frustration with the team\u2019s offense and the overall direction of the Vikings (2-2).\n\n\u2014The New England Patriots signed kicker Mike Nugent to replace the injured Stephen Gostkowski.\n\nNugent had joined fellow kickers Kai Forbath, Elliott Fry, Blair Walsh and Matthew Wright in working out for the Patriots (4-0) earlier in the week.\n\nNugent last kicked for the Oakland Raiders, making all six field-goal attempts and 4 of 5 extra-point tries in three games last season before landing on injured reserve with an ailing hip.\n\n\u2014Washington Redskins quarterback Case Keenum returned from a foot injury to practice on a limited basis on Thursday, but it remains unclear who will start Sunday against the visiting New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting closer here,\u201d head coach Jay Gruden said when asked if he\u2019s made a decision between Keenum, Colt McCoy and rookie first-rounder Dwayne Haskins. \u201cI think we had a good day of work today, and we\u2019ll follow up tomorrow, see how they do and see how healthy they are, and make sure we\u2019re all on the same page and go from there.\u201d\n\n\u2014New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley told reporters that he \u201cfelt good\u201d after he completed his second consecutive day of running in his bid to work his way back from a high ankle sprain.\n\nBarkley, who officially was listed on the injury report as \u201cdid not practice,\u201d originally was expected to miss four to eight weeks after he was hobbled off in New York\u2019s 32-31 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sept. 22.\n\nThe Giants (2-2) have not ruled out the 22-year-old Barkley for Sunday\u2019s game against the visiting Vikings.\n\n\u2014The NFL will hear the appeal of Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict\u2019s suspension on Tuesday, according to multiple reports.\n\nBurfict was suspended for the rest of the season after his helmet-to-helmet hit on Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle on Sunday. The length of the ban was influenced by the linebacker\u2019s on-field history.\n\n\u2014Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon will play and possibly start Sunday as he works his way back from a two-month holdout, coach Anthony Lynn said.\n\nGordon, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, was active but did not play last Sunday in the Chargers\u2019 30-10 road victory against the Miami Dolphins. He ended his 64-day holdout on Sept. 26.\n\n\u2014Cleveland Browns receiver Jarvis Landry remains in concussion protocol, raising questions about his availability for the Monday game against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Browns will see the return of wide receiver Antonio Callaway from a four-game suspension assessed for a violation of the NFL\u2019s substance-abuse policy.\n\n\u2014The San Francisco 49ers announced a series of moves, placing wide receiver Jalen Hurd and cornerback Jason Verrett on injured reserve, signing corner Dontae Johnson and well-traveled receiver Jordan Matthews and re-signing offensive lineman Will Holden to their practice squad.\n\nSan Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan also intimated that defensive back Jimmie Ward could be back in action Monday. Ward broke a finger in the preseason and hasn\u2019t played since, but he returned to practice Thursday.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold is preparing to return from mononucleosis to start Sunday's game in Philadelphia, but he will yield to doctors if they determine that playing would risk his safety.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436848197&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF93019-OCASP"}
