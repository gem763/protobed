(Niquel Johnson)\n\nNiquel Johnson paid for three drinks in Philadelphia on Sunday, and in typical Starbucks fashion, an employee asked for his name. Johnson, 40, told them \u201cAziz,\u201d his Islamic name pronounced ah-zeez. He has used it for 25 years \u2014 and \u201ccountless\u201d times at that particular store.\n\nBut three unusual things happened on this occasion, he said. When his order was ready, a staffer announced them by drink type, not his name.\n\nThe second unusual part was the employee wrote his name as \u201cISIS\u201d \u2014 the acronym for the Islamic terror group \u2014 in the printout attached to all three drinks.\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t even realize it until later, when a friend pointed it out at a bookstore.\n\n\u201cI was shocked and angry. I felt it was discrimination,\u201d Johnson told The Washington Post on Friday.\n\nThe third unusual part: Four days later, after the story hit social media and a reporter tweeted about it, Starbucks called Johnson to claim the company had already rectified the situation in conversation with Johnson\u2019s niece \u2014 a person Johnson says doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIt is not the first time the global chain has faced accusations of racism and discrimination in a Philadelphia store. Last year, an employee called police on two black men sitting in a downtown location, and they were led away in handcuffs.\n\nThe incident prompted an apology from CEO Kevin Johnson and national staff training on unconscious bias at 8,000 stores.\n\nBut this corporate response has been different, with representatives downplaying these new allegations.\n\n\u201cAfter investigating, we don\u2019t believe this was a case of discrimination or profiling,\u201d Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said in a statement. \u201cThe customer approached and provided the name Aziz. The barista mistakenly spelled it incorrectly. We have connected with Mr. Johnson and apologized for this regrettable mistake.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier statement, Borges said Starbucks contacted his \u201cfamily\u201d to apologize.\n\nExcept, Johnson said, it didn\u2019t happen that way.\n\nA Starbucks district manager who called Johnson Thursday night said the company believed the issue had been resolved earlier in the week after speaking with a niece of Johnson\u2019s named Alora.\n\nBut Johnson said he has no niece named Alora. He doesn\u2019t even know anyone by that name \u2014 and Starbucks has been at a loss getting to the bottom of how, exactly, it discussed Johnson\u2019s case with someone he doesn\u2019t know after he left a phone number on an emailed complaint.\n\nIn a Thursday night call between Johnson and Starbucks representative Brian Dragone, a recording of which was provided to The Post, Johnson tells Dragone he has no niece named Alora, and his nieces are too young to speak for him anyway.\n\n\u201cSo that is a new revelation for me and us, Niquel,\u201d Dragone says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how we got to that point. I apologize.\u201d\n\nThat person, Dragone claims, told another Starbucks staffer that the customer was an uncle who spells his name \u201cAzese\u201d \u2014 even though an email complaint sent by Johnson Monday and obtained by The Post shows his name as \u201cAziz.\u201d\n\n\u201cAzese \u2014 A-Z-E-S-E. Is that not accurate? That name?\u201d Dragone says.\n\nJohnson corrects him. \u201cNo. My name is spelled A-Z-I-Z.\"\n\nDragone revisits the issue, pressing Johnson about the niece. He apologizes for the mix-up, suggesting Johnson was not contacted before Thursday because of the misunderstanding with his colleague. \u201cI have no explanation for that. We\u2019re going to have to figure that out on our end who that was who we spoke to,\u201d Dragone says.\n\n\u201cNo, this can\u2019t be resolved by a simple apology at this point. I feel as though I was discriminated against, and there\u2019s no apology that can simply be an apology at this point,\u201d Johnson tells him. \u201cI just think your colleague is making this story up.\u201d\n\nBorges said Friday the call from the woman and a delay between the online complaint being received by the store exacerbated the confusion. \u201cThe assumption was that we spoke to his niece. We thought the loop was closed,\u201d he said, adding that the company tried its best.\n\nBut who is the woman?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Borges said. \u201cHe says it\u2019s not a relative and I believe that.\u201d\n\nThe episode has further bewildered Johnson, who said he is considering legal action. He expected Starbucks to be more deliberate and careful after the other Philadelphia incident last year.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re not taking it seriously as it is,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think they would have their facts in order. How could they allow anyone to speak for me?\"\n\nTimothy Bella contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cI was shocked and angry.
