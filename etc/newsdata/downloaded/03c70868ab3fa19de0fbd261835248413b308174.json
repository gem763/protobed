In Comic Sans.", "language": "en", "text": "Two of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s associates will not comply with a congressional committee\u2019s deadline to appear and produce documents relating to their work in Ukraine, according to a letter written by their lawyer in a rather unusual font.\n\n\u201cComic Sans\u201d was trending Monday on Twitter when a legal notice written by lawyer John Dowd, who was President Donald Trump\u2019s lead attorney in the Russian interference investigation, was made public.\n\nHe wrote a letter in Comic Sans, printed it out, signed it, scanned it, then e-mailed the scan.\n\n\n\nI kind of admire his consistency, such a ridiculous process and ugly appearance befits the frivolous arguments made in the letter. https://t.co/Tej5lBlWfy \u2014 Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) October 7, 2019\n\nDowd\u2019s notice, which was dated Oct. 3, informed the House Intelligence Committee that his clients Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman would not meet the Monday deadline to voluntarily turn over documents relating to their activities with Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nDowd labeled the request and time frame provided as \u201cunduly burdensome,\u201d adding that he believed the Democratic committee members\u2019 intent was to \u201charass, intimidate and embarrass\u201d his clients.\n\nDemocrats working on the intensifying impeachment inquiry into the president said the two businessmen\u2019s decision to ignore the request would lead to subpoenas. Giuliani was subpoenaed last month for documents relating to the inquiry.\n\nParnas and Fruman were cited (although not by name) in the government whistleblower complaint alleging misconduct by the president. The two Soviet-born South Florida businessmen introduced Giuliani to top Ukrainian political circles, according to reports.\n\nParnas told the Miami Herald that, thanks to his friendship with Giuliani, he and Fruman were able to provide the Trump administration with information on alleged wrongdoing by Trump\u2019s 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and the unfounded allegations are instead being investigated as an attempt by Trump to enlist foreign assistance in order to smear his potential rival for the presidency in 2020.\n\nOn Monday, Twitter users were in awe that an attorney of Dowd\u2019s status and experience would write a letter of such gravity in a font widely considered to be childlike and, well, just the worst:\n\nIt's a little-known fact that a lawyer who emails the scan of a signed printout of a legal letter originally typed out in Comic Sans is automatically disbarred pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90(2) https://t.co/Rwakta4Gk3 \u2014 Letters of Note (@LettersOfNote) October 7, 2019\n\nIt really is impressive that John Dowd has built up such a solid career that he can write official letters in comic sans and not lose all of his clients https://t.co/SHr19URPCl \u2014 Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) October 7, 2019\n\nVIA E-MAIL in comic sans this is the extremely good lawyerin\u2019 shit https://t.co/zKmizbjDDZ \u2014 kilgore trout will be the hero (@KT_So_It_Goes) October 7, 2019\n\nFriends don\u2019t let friends use comic sans https://t.co/74gHPluZKg \u2014 Mollie Bryant (@MollieEBryant) October 7, 2019\n\nNothing says quality legal representation like Comic Sans https://t.co/MXEggSnnRU \u2014 Brendan Nyhan (@BrendanNyhan) October 7, 2019\n\nOthers thought the font was befitting for the letter\u2019s content and the times in which we currently live:\n\nOh my god The Stupidest Timeline has finally hit Comic Sans https://t.co/HR0iPAVgYI \u2014 Laura Hudson (@laura_hudson) October 7, 2019\n\nThis whole administration was written in comic sans \u2014 Jeffrey Burr (@JeffreyFBurr) October 7, 2019\n\nI know that \"hating Comic Sans\" has become emblematic of a kind of boring and extremely online snobbery, but honestly I think this might be the most fitting use for it possibly ever? https://t.co/a1rnXMeqlX \u2014 andi zeisler (@andizeisler) October 7, 2019\n\nHistorians will call our time \u201cthe Comic Sans Era.\u201d https://t.co/DmGJsYK58V \u2014 John M. Donnelly (@johnmdonnelly) October 7, 2019\n\nAnd some pointed out the font seemed to be a favorite of Dowd\u2019s for formal communications:\n\nLove HuffPost? Become a founding member of HuffPost Plus today.\n\nJohn Dowd still writes his letters in comic sans. (He also the used the font in a January 2018 letter to Robert Mueller when he was representing President Trump: https://t.co/snlSFyyzH6) https://t.co/Z1QNWJ0ZVR \u2014 Gabe Fleisher (@WakeUp2Politics) October 7, 2019\n\nComic Sans appears to be John Dowd\u2019s preferred font. https://t.co/jPzb8s9rYo https://t.co/zIR4Qu0hkx \u2014 Ryan J.
