You have also undermined the public's trust in the lottery itself.\"\n\nImage copyright South Beds News Agency Image caption The fake ticket was used by Putman to claim the Lottery win\n\nPutman claimed the win on 28 August 2009 by using a badly-damaged ticket forged by Mr Knibbs, who worked for Camelot in the fraud detection department.\n\nMr Knibbs had seen a document containing details of big wins which had not yet been claimed and prosecutor James Keeley said there was \"some trial and error\" in producing the successful forgery.\n\nThe court heard each ticket had one of the 100 different possible unique codes at the bottom and Putman had gone to 29 different shops, providing a different ticket in each, before the right number was found at a shop in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.\n\nMr Knibbs confessed to friends he had \"conned\" the Lottery after the row with Putman, a convicted rapist and benefits cheat, in June 2015.\n\nHe also told them about technical inaccuracies in the creation of the ticket that Putman, of Station Road, had used.\n\nEvidence suggested Mr Knibbs was initially paid \u00a3280,000 by Putman for his part in the ruse, followed by much smaller increments totalling \u00a350,000.\n\nImage copyright South Beds News Agency Image caption Edward Putman was pictured outside court covering his face\n\nPutman was paid the jackpot by Camelot in September 2009 despite the bottom part of the mangled slip missing the barcode, the trial heard.\n\nThree years later he was sentenced to nine months in jail for benefit fraud after claiming \u00a313,000 in housing and income support following his win.\n\nIn 2016, the Gambling Commission fined Camelot \u00a33m for breaching its operating licence regarding controlling databases, investigating prize claims, and paying out prizes.\n\nA Camelot spokeswoman said there were \"some weaknesses in some of the specific controls relevant to this incident at the time and we're very sorry for that\".\n\n\"We've strengthened our processes significantly since then and are completely confident that an incident of this nature could not happen today,\" she added.\n\nThe genuine winning ticket, which was bought in Worcester, has never been discovered.\n\nTapashi Nadarajah, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Putman's \"lies unravelled with the tragic death of his co-conspirator who he wasn't prepared to share the money with\".", "description": "Edward Putman was helped by an insider who knew how to cheat the National Lottery system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12E6C/production/_109102477_putman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
