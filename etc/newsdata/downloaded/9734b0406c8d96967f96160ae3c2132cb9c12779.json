Roughly 40 percent of cross-border parcels handled by Cainiao come from Yiwu and its surrounding areas.", "description": "A train bound for Liege, Belgium on Wednesday made its first journey from China's small commodities hub Yiwu, expanding the China-Europe corridor for small and medium-sized exporters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d9c65a310cf3e97a054c0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
