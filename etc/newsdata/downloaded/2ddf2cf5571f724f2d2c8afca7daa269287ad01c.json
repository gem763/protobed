However, nearly halfway through the 2019 season, this year's Patriots haven't been defined by Tom Brady and a systematic, unstoppable offense, but rather by their historically suffocating defense.\n\nThe Patriots have not allowed more than 14 points all season and have held opponents to a touchdown or less in four of seven games. On Monday, the Patriots shut out the Jets in New York, 33-0, in a game that wasn't even that close.\n\nRead more: Top 14 waiver-wire pickups for Week 8 of fantasy football\n\nIt was New England's second 30-point road shutout of the season, having already scored a 43-0 win over the Dolphins in Week 2. According to Elias Sports, only the 1942 Chicago Bears have ever recorded two such shutouts in the same season.\n\nThe Patriots defense put up a Monday night masterpiece against the Jets, tormenting Sam Darnold throughout the game.\n\nMonday night's deconstruction of the Jets was a flawless performance from the Patriots. The defense refused to let Sam Darnold get comfortable, forcing four interceptions and one fumble out of the young quarterback.\n\nAt times, it seemed like the Patriots were toying with Darnold. New England repeatedly threw Cover 0 defenses at him, all but daring the Jets to beat them through the air and forcing Darnold into awful decisions time and time again.\n\nThe Patriots mixed things up later in the game. They showed blitz only to have their defenders drop into coverage to intercept Darnold and end the Jets' best offensive push of the game.\n\nWhen the game finally ended, the Patriots had held the Jets to just 167 yards of total offense and held Darnold's quarterback to 11 of 32 passes and a ghastly 3.6 rating.\n\n\"Seeing ghosts,\" said Darnold on the Jets sideline while mic'd up for the game.\n\nIn that, Darnold is not alone.\n\nThe Patriots defense has been this good all season, in part thanks to Bill Belichick once again running the show.\n\nThe dominance of the Patriots defense hasn't been contained to one or two games this year. Instead, it's been a sustained, week-after-week assault on opposing quarterbacks, resulting in a remarkable turnover rate and setting up Brady and the New England offense with short fields and easy scores.\n\nThe Patriots have a whopping 18 interceptions so far this season, twice as many as the next leading defense in the NFL, and sport a +14 turnover differential through their first seven games of the year. Making things especially tough on their division, they're the only team in the AFC East with a positive turnover differential.\n\nRead more: There is growing buzz about the Patriots pulling off a perfect season\n\nMuch of the credit has to go to head coach Bill Belichick. After the departure of former defensive coordinator Brian Flores, Belichick took over the Patriots defense.\n\nBelichick has been engaged and could be seen coaching up his defense even after they had already jumped out to a 24-0 lead in the first half against the Jets.\n\nBelichick's results have been undeniable.\n\nSo far this season, the Patriots defense as scored more points than they've given up on the field.\n\nThe Patriots' success has stemmed from a team effort united in the goal of making life miserable for opponents. Five players already have multiple interceptions on the season, with Devin McCourty leading the way with five. Eight players have multiple tackles for loss, with Jamie Collins Sr. topping the Patriots with nine.\n\nAt every level, the Patriots have someone that can present a unique problem to offenses hoping to contain them, and the result has been a comprehensive and unrelenting defensive unit.\n\nIt's enough to make even Belichick smile ... almost.\n\n\u2014Don Van Natta Jr. (@DVNJr) October 22, 2019\n\nSome might argue that the Patriots have yet to face a real challenge on their schedule, and there is some truth to that \u2014 upcoming games against the Ravens, Cowboys, and Texans should give us a better idea of how their defense translates against better competition.\n\nBut you can only play the teams that are in front of you, and so far, no one has been able to do a thing against the most dominant unit in the NFL.\n\nOh, and on top of all of that, Tom Brady is still Tom Brady.\n\nWhile the Patriots' success this year can mostly be attributed to their defense, the New England offense is still a force despite the fact that Tom Brady likely has less talent surrounding him than ever before in his career.\n\nBrady is averaging 285 passing yards a game with a receiving corps that is made up of Julian Edelman, Phillip Dorsett, and Josh Gordon, and notably, without a dominant tight end.\n\nRead more: Former Patriots centers say Tom Brady shoves towels and powder down their pants to avoid getting wet footballs from 'the swamp ass'\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the New England traded for Mohamed Sanu, immediately improving Brady's options and providing yet another reason to believe that the Patriots are all but a lock to appear in their fourth straight Super Bowl.\n\nBetween their dominant defense, unmatched coaching, and ever-reliable offense, it's going to take a perfect game from another team to finally beat the Patriots at some point this season.\n\nAnd if Belichick and the defense keep rolling as they have through the first half of the season, even that might not be enough.\n\nAaron Rodgers called for a little-known receiver to play against the Lions, and he wound up making the biggest play\n\nTop 14 waiver-wire pickups for Week 8 of fantasy football\n\nBUY LOW/SELL HIGH: Players to target for the second half of the fantasy football season\n\nRussell Wilson was forced to improvise when his helmet radio malfunctioned and led the Seahawks to a critical touchdown", "description": "Bill Belichick and the Patriots defense are terrorizing opposing offenses in ways the NFL has never seen before.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf074f4af9096cd9513eb3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
