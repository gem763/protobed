Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, has demanded Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg testify in front of her committee before Libra is rolled out. Along with privacy concerns, Waters\u2019 has cited the potential for Libra to be used in money laundering and other financial crimes.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats and even President Donald Trump have called for in various degrees for Facebook to be subject to U.S. banking laws - an arduous, complicated prospect - if the social media company does move forward with the Libra project. In response, Facebook has reportedly hired several prominent Washington lobbyists to convince politicians to give their approval to Libra.\n\nPayPal Holdings Inc., which is based in San Jose, California, is the first company to publicly end its partnership with Libra, but other companies have been reportedly having second thoughts. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Mastercard and Visa, the world\u2019s largest payment providers, were considering ending their Libra relationships.\n\nThe Libra Association said it plans to continue to move forward with the project without PayPal.\n\n\u201cBuilding (Libra) is a journey, not a destination \u2026 each organization that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises,\u201d said Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "PayPal has pulled out of Facebook's digital currency project, known as Libra, a blow to the social media company that has faced stronger-than-expected scrutiny over its proposed creation of an alternative payments system.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Sweet"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/paypal-libra_72520_c0-189-3392-2166_s1770x1032.jpg?0a8afd20b32fdb1bb7e06c288878efbebfbd4900", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
