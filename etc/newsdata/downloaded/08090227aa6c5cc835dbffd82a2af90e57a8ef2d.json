She would also spend hours at her mother\u2019s house playing marathon video games on her Sega Genesis.\n\nThat urge to help propelled Atatiana through a biology/pre-med degree at Xavier University of Louisiana and spurred her to spend the summer at her mother\u2019s Fort Worth home while her mother went through heart surgery. Atatiana was in that home with her 8-year-old nephew, Zion, early Saturday when a Fort Worth officer shot and killed her through a bedroom window, police said. The two were playing video games at the time.\n\n\u201cThis loss is one of the most unbelievable things you can ever imagine \u2013 to know that your sister was doing what she normally does and got killed for it,\u201d older sister Ashley Carr said in an interview with USA TODAY. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep on going. Right now, it\u2019s just really hard.\u201d\n\nAaron Dean was arrested on a murder charge Monday, hours after resigning from the force, and police on Tuesday released an arrest warrant quoting Zion, the nephew, as saying Atatiana had pulled a gun from her purse after hearing someone creeping around her house.\n\nBody camera video released by Fort Worth police show Dean quietly making his way around the house, past the open front door and into the darkened backyard before shouting at Atatiana to show her hands and, a split second later, firing into the window.\n\nTarnished brass:Hundreds of police officers have been labeled liars. Some still help send people to prison.\n\nS. Lee Merritt, an attorney for family, said Dean\u2019s arrest was a good first step but a slew of unanswered questions remain, including if there are more body camera videos of the scene and whether senior officers were present at the time of the shooting.\n\n\u201cThis one officer obviously did something terrible and tragic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this was a breakdown from the top to the bottom.\u201d\n\nAdarius Carr, Atatiana\u2019s brother, said the case needs to go beyond Dean\u2019s prosecution. \u201cThe system failed him. Whoever sent him out failed him. \u2026 The training failed him,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that needs to be fixed.\u201d\n\nThe younger Atatiana Jefferson\n\nFamily members still reeled from the news of Atatiana\u2019s death but also reveled in memories of their youngest sibling. The youngest of four, Atatiana was known as a \u201ctomboy in skirts,\u201d climbing trees, joining in flag-football games and, once, shimmying a tree to climb atop of the roof of the house, Ashley Carr said.\n\nShe read constantly and became enamored with science, she said, dissecting small animals at home or watching her favorite TV show, \u201cBill Nye the Science Guy.\u201d She would get straight-As on her report card and help her older siblings with their homework.\n\n'No forgiveness for this one':Texas police face backlash after shooting, killing Atatiana Jefferson in her home\n\n\u201cShe was always inquisitive, always trying to learn more, always doing more,\u201d Ashley Carr said.\n\nIn high school, Atatiana played clarinet in band and earned a reputation for being nice to outcast students. \u201cThere were people who didn\u2019t fit in and she was always very kind to them,\u201d said Cheryl Calhoun, who attended Lake Highlands High School in northeast Dallas with Atatiana.\n\nA 'second mom' to her nephew\n\nAfter graduating from Xavier, Atatiana was paying down her debt and saving to go to medical school \u2013 either at Meharry Medical College in Nashville or in Houston with a friend.\n\nShe also indulged in her other love: her nephew, Zion, often taking him on overnights or sharing her love of video games with him. \u201cZion and Atatiana were best friends,\u201d Amber Carr, Zion\u2019s mother, said. \u201cShe was like his second mom. When you see her, you see him. Most people thought he was hers.\u201d\n\nLapaca Jefferson, 57, Atatiana\u2019s uncle, said the family was stunned by the shooting. He was in Houston attending an anti-violence meetup over the weekend when he heard the news.\n\n\u201cThe Jefferson family\u2019s dreams have been shattered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great shock.\u201d", "description": "The family of Atatiana Jefferson is still reeling from her death and questioning the \"terrible and tragic\" actions of former officer Aaron Dean.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/15/USAT/338ef9b6-c717-4034-90ec-05184f71f21d-AP_Police_Shooting_in_Home_Texas_Profile.JPG?crop=959,959,x0,y0&width=959&height=959&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
