Which is, of course, always something you want to encourage.\n\nThe game was already looking great when we played it back in June, but instead of November it now won\u2019t be out until 20 March 2020, on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. There is a Nintendo Switch version too but that won\u2019t be out until even later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe previously announced Invasion Mode, which will allow you to enter another player\u2019s game as a demon, still won\u2019t be ready in time for launch though, so presumably the delay\u2019s not because of that.\n\nIf you pre-order now though you\u2019ll get a copy of N64 classic Doom 64 for free on any format, and not just the Switch. Or you can wait till March and buy it separately then.\n\nThe delay is a particular shame because the game had a pretty good slot on 22 November, as the last major release of the year.\n\nNow it comes out between Final Fantasy VII Remake and Watch Dogs: Legion on 3 and 6 March and Cyberpunk 2077 on 16 April. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is also out the same day.\n\nHopefully there\u2019s enough time between releases for Doom to make its mark, but you\u2019ve got to wonder just how much money people are going have to spare by that point, in what is the busiest spring for new games in a long time.\n\nOFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM ID SOFTWARE:\n\nThroughout the development of Doom Eternal, our goal has been to deliver a game that exceeds your greatest expectations across the board.\n\nTo make sure we\u2019re delivering the best experience \u2014 for Doom Eternal to live up to our standards of speed and polish \u2014 we\u2019ve made the decision to extend our launch date by a few months to March 20, 2020. We know many fans will be disappointed by this delay, but we are confident that Doom Eternal will deliver a gaming experience that is worth the wait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to shifting the DOOM Eternal launch date, we\u2019ve made a couple other changes we wanted you to know about:\n\n\u2022 Invasion Mode, which will allow you to enter another player\u2019s game as a playable demon, will release as a free update shortly after launch.\n\n\u2022 Doom Eternal for Nintendo Switch will release after the other platforms. We will announce that date in the future.\n\n\u2022 Doom 64 will be available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC in addition to Nintendo Switch. We are adding Doom 64 as a pre-order bonus for Doom Eternal on all platforms so you\u2019ll be able to download and play this classic game, for free, just for pre-ordering Doom Eternal. Doom 64 will be released on March 20, 2020 on all platforms.\n\nWe are grateful to every DOOM fan for your dedication and support \u2013 we can\u2019t wait to rip-and-tear right alongside you.\n\nid Software\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "Bethesda has announced that Doom Eternal won\u2019t be out this Christmas after all but has instead been pushed back to next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/doom_eternal_fire_baron_1533718919-d900_1570545651.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
