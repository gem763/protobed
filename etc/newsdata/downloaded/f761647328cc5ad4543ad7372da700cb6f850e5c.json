He then drove home his second late on before sliding through Luis Suarez to make it five.\n\nYet in truth his two goals and two assists were just the start of it, the defining moments of another mesmeric all-round performance that was dotted with flicks, passes and dribbles, not to mention two humiliating nutmegs.\n\nValladolid had threatened to make a game of it when Kiko Olivas benefitted from a rare Marc-Andre ter Stegen error to equalise, after Clement Lenglet had struck in the second minute.\n\nBut with Messi in this sort of mood, the result never felt in doubt as victory sent Barcelona back to the top of La Liga, after Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw by Alaves a couple of hours before.\n\nErnesto Valverde\u2019s side have now won seven consecutive matches in all competitions, a run that began by beating Villarreal on September 24, when Messi returned from injury to make his first start of the season.\n\nHe has needed time, admitting earlier this month he was still short of sharpness even as goals flew in against Sevilla, Eibar and Slavia Prague.\n\nBut this display sent a resounding message that Messi is back to his best.\n\nValladolid were perhaps unfortunate the 32-year-old was fresh after the postponed Clasico on Saturday meant Barcelona and Real Madrid were given the weekend off.\n\nIt meant this was the first game at Camp Nou since violent protests broke out across Catalonia after nine pro-independence leaders were sentenced to imprisonment on October 21.\n\nGiant yellow banners with \u2018Independencia\u2019 and \u2018Llibertat\u2019 written across them were unfurled before kick-off but there was no sign of unrest. Instead, the mood turned celebratory as Messi got to work.\n\nIt was his free-kick that Valladolid made a mess of clearing, as Sergi Guardiola lashed the ball against Joaquin Fernandez and Lenglet reacted fastest, his shot deflecting in before two minutes were on the clock.\n\n\u2013 Messi runs the show \u2013\n\nThe procession was briefly halted when Ter Stegen, perhaps unsighted, slapped a cross straight into the shin of Olivas but the remaining 30 minutes of the first half belonged to Messi.\n\nHe switched the ball for Frenkie de Jong to slightly overhit a pass for Arturo Vidal and then replicated the Dutchman\u2019s effort but did it better, this time picking out Vidal perfectly to score at the back post.\n\nFive minutes later he sent a free-kick curling away from Jordi Masip, who scuttled across his line but could never reach the ball as it nestled in the top right-hand corner.\n\nMessi flicked one through the legs of Oscar Plano, who threw his head back and for a moment stopped dead in frustration. Then it was Guardiola\u2019s turn, only this time the nutmeg doubled up as a pass.\n\nAfter half-time, Ansu Fati, making his last appearance before turning 17, should have tucked away a Messi pass before two goals in the 75th and 77th minutes put Valladolid out of sight.\n\nMessi cushioned Ivan Rakitic\u2019s cute pass on his thigh and drove it into the corner and then slid in Suarez, who finished for his eighth goal of the season.\n\nIn injury time, Messi should have had his hat-trick but curled wide of the left post when he seemed certain to score. It might have been his first mistake all night.\n\nAtletico Madrid could have done with a drop of Messi\u2019s attacking inspiration as they were held to a disappointing draw by Alaves.\n\nAlvaro Morata came off the bench to score his third goal in as many games but Lucas Perez hit a stunning late equaliser at Menizorrotza to ensure a tight contest between two of La Liga\u2019s most stubborn defences ended all square.\n\nAtletico sit third, two points behind Barcelona and level with Granada, having played one game more.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Lionel Messi made it clear he is fit and back to his scintillating best by tearing apart Real Valladolid on Tuesday in a thumping 5-1", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/bc7a43_lionel-messi-scored-two-assists-as-barcelona-returned-top-la-liga-messi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
