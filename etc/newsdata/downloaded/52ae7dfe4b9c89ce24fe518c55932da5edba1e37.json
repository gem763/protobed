But this year, it looks like they are entering the more dramatic and gritty territory \u2013 and Jennie McAlpine is not ruling out a shock death. Yikes!\n\nAt the moment, Fiz is being stalked by a strange nanny called Jade, who appears to have quite the vendetta towards her. And with Jennie confirming that Fiz will be very busy over Christmas, could Jade\u2019s true intentions and dangerous side come to the fore \u2013 with tragic results?\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Star Sunday, Jennie said: \u2018I\u2019ve read the script for Christmas Eve. It\u2019s quite dramatic. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be getting any turkey this year. Fiz is going to be quite busy! It\u2019s not all mistletoe and jingle bells. I can\u2019t say if anyone dies. If I told someone that, I\u2019d have to kill them!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSally Ann Matthews, who was central to last year\u2019s cliffhanger, added: \u2018I\u2019ve just received scripts for Christmas. What I can say is it\u2019s beyond dramatic. It\u2019s big and edge-of-your-seat stuff. It\u2019s not just one story either.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018There are several big stories happening. We usually have feel-good Christmas episodes. And this year it certainly starts off that way. People will want to tune in for it on Christmas Day. My advice is not to have too much turkey and eggnog so you\u2019ll still be awake enough to watch it!\u2019\n\nSounds exciting \u2013 and there is no let up in the heavy hitting drama either across the autumn. Not only is there the death of Sinead Tinker in some of the most heartbreaking scenes in a long time but there will be a stabbing during a prison riot and a Christmas showdown as the truth about sex abuser Kel is revealed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Corrie is planning a blockbuster Christmas Day.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/corrie-christmas_1570970597.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
