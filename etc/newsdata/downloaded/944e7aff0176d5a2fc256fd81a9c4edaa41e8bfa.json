Dressing defendants in civilian clothing is common practice during trials to prevent jury prejudice.\n\nCHINESE WOMAN ARRESTED AT MAR-A-LAGO CAN REPRESENT SELF AT TRIAL, BUT IS MAKING 'BAD DECISION,' JUDGE SAYS\n\nThe 33-year-old Shanghai business consultant was eventually taken to a holding cell, where she changed into a blouse and khaki pants that were found in her hotel room after Secret Service agents arrested her at the Florida club in March.\n\nBut Zhang\u2019s issues began well before the jury selection.\n\nZhang fired her public defenders in June against the recommendation of U.S. District Judge Roy Altman in order to represent herself with the use of a translator. But during pretrial hearings, she at times appeared to struggle with answering simple questions in English, while replying with near-fluency at other times.\n\nZhang\u2019s behavior at the hearings led Altman to repeatedly accuse the Chinese national of \u201cplaying games.\u201d\n\nWHAT CHINESE SPIES WANT FROM AMERICANS\n\nLanguage became another issue Monday when Zhang claimed that she hadn\u2019t spoken Mandarin in months and was finding it difficult to follow her interpreter.\n\nShe also told Altman \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am here,\u201d claiming she wasn\u2019t prepared because she thought the trial had been canceled. Altman previously ordered Zhang\u2019s public defenders to provide her with law books to study while examining the evidence.\n\nSecret Service agents arrested Zhang after she tried to enter the Florida club on March 30. Agents said they found her carrying a computer, cellphones and other electronics. She also had a signal detector meant to spot hidden cameras and a significant amount of cash stashed in her area hotel room.\n\nAgents initially said a thumb drive in her possession contained malware, but later recanted that accusation.\n\nWhile Zhang isn\u2019t charged with espionage, prosecutors have filed secret evidence under seal that they say has national security implications.\n\nZhang has pleaded not guilty to charges of unlawful entry and making false statements. She faces up to six years in prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted. She has been held without bond.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHer former public defenders are on standby, sitting in the gallery behind her, in case she changes her mind about acting as her own attorney.\n\nWhile they have said Zhang appeared mentally competent, she's refused to speak with a psychologist. Relatives in China told them she has no mental health problems.\n\nFox News' Greg Norman, Travis Fedschun and Samuel Chamberlain and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The Chinese woman accused of illegally entering President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort with several electronic devices and then lying to the Secret Service about it is finally about to have her day in federal court -- but the bizarre case took an even stranger turn Monday when jury selection was reportedly interrupted by the defendant's lack of underwear.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Yujing-Zhang-court-sketch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
