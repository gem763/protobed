Here's What He Learned from Planning His Own", "language": "en", "text": "Like many on the cusp of retirement, David Littell felt excited and a little nervous. But the 65-year-old differed from his peers in one key way: He spent the bulk of his career teaching retirement planning to financial advisors.\n\nLittell is a Professor Emeritus at the American College of Financial Services, where he co-created the Retirement Income Certified Professional\u00ae designation. In other words, he\u2019s a pro at one of the most complex tasks retirees face: turning a lump sum of savings into a reliable income stream that will last for life. And as he approached retirement himself, Littell discovered some key differences between what the textbooks say and the way things play out in real life.\n\n\u201cIn financial planning, we tend to think it\u2019s all about the numbers,\u201d says Littell, of Ardmore, Pa. \u201cBut I want to own the emotions. The idea that you don\u2019t have a paycheck anymore is rather terrifying.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s addressed this fear in his planning process. Here\u2019s what Littell has learned by finally living what he\u2019s taught all these years:\n\nStart with Something\n\nFinancial advisors love to ask their clients detailed questions about their future plans: When are you going to retire? Will you work in retirement? If so, how much?\n\nIn reality, \u201cit\u2019s hard to nail that down until you\u2019re close to it,\u201d Littell says. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my plans four or five times.\u201d\n\nFor starters, you don\u2019t know how your health will hold up. Some 43% of workers retire earlier than planned, and of those 35% stop working due to a health problem or disability, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nAlso, while you\u2019re still working full-time, you\u2019re probably not looking for a part-time job to supplement your retirement income. So you don\u2019t know how feasible it is to get the kind of part-time work you want, or how much you might earn once you find it. Alternatively, if you\u2019d rather continue working for your former employer on a part-time or consulting basis, you won\u2019t likely broach the topic with them until you\u2019ve given your notice. All this means that it\u2019s hard to have real numbers to plug into retirement income calculations in advance.\n\nYet that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t try, Littell says. There\u2019s a good reason advisors ask all these questions, to try to make accurate projections of your retirement income. It\u2019s helpful to know how much you\u2019ll have coming in, to make sure it\u2019s enough to meet your needs. (To ballpark those needs, Littell suggests a simple method: use your most recent paycheck as a proxy for the retirement income you\u2019ll need each month \u2014 assuming, of course, that you live within your means and aren\u2019t racking up credit card debt to fund your lifestyle.)\n\nSo go ahead and make some assumptions, and do your calculations based on those. But understand that estimates are just that, and are subject to change. Revisit your plan regularly, and make sure the numbers are going to work before you give up your full-time gig. \u201cPeople should think really carefully before they leave full-time work,\u201d Littell says. Many people get tired of the grind and let their emotions govern the decision of when to quit, he says. But if you leave the workforce and then regret your decision, it\u2019s very hard to re-enter at the same salary with the same benefits.\n\nFor his part, Littell recently cut back to working three days a week and plans to further reduce his hours as he shifts to a consulting role early next year.\n\nListen to Your Gut\n\nLittell\u2019s father lived to age 104. Aware he might have similar longevity, Littell didn\u2019t want to risk outliving his savings. So he bought several annuities, insurance products that turn your lump sum into guaranteed income for life.\n\nFinancial advisors commonly recommend that clients use annuities to cover their essential spending. This way, all of your necessary needs will be covered by a \u201cfloor\u201d of guaranteed income, and you can use your 401(k) or IRA withdrawals for discretionary fun. The logic behind this strategy is that, if stocks take a dive, you can always curtail your travel plans, but you can\u2019t suddenly stop paying your mortgage or your Medicare premiums.\n\nTo determine your essential spending, you would tally up what you pay for housing, health care, food and other necessary categories. Then, you calculate how much of the total would be covered by Social Security and any pensions you might have. An annuity or annuities would be used to cover any shortfall.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The numbers don't always tell the whole story.", "authors": ["Elizabeth O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TWjXcC5C5WsiRT4_68c6wQ--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/5d92b4f5f41bc280f10a9a75a2f825ba", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
