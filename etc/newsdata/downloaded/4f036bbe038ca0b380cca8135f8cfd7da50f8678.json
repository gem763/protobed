When you\u2019re on the road in an environment like this and you turn the ball over, it is going to be hard to overcome.\u201d\n\nWitten had the ball punched out of his left arm from behind by New Orleans linebacker A.J. Klein at the end of a 16-yard catch. Vonn Bell recovered that fumble, then caused and recovered the fumble by Elliott, who lost the ball just as an elbow hit the turf after the star running back converted a fourth-and-1 run.\n\nWithout those miscues, the outcome might have been similar to the slow-starting victory over winless Miami a week earlier. Instead, offensive coordinator Kellen Moore had his first clunker after a strong start, and quarterback Dak Prescott has an all-too-familiar feeling from the first half of last season when the offense struggled.\n\nLast year, Dallas was 3-5 when the turnaround kicked in and led to a second NFC East title in three seasons with Prescott and Elliott. In that respect, the Cowboys are still ahead of the game, but they won\u2019t be winning much with Elliott averaging 1.9 yards per carry (second worst of his career, 18 carries for 35 yards).\n\n\u201cThis was on us. This was about our lack of execution,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cRegardless of the way they were doing things, there were a lot of plays left out there on my part and this whole offense\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nAfter two games that made it appear something was off, the Dallas defense has looked much more like the 2018 unit that helped carry the team early in the season when the offense struggled. The team\u2019s first interception of the season led to the game\u2019s first points against the Saints.\n\nSeveral of the season-high five sacks were timely, most notably Jaylon Smith\u2019s 16-yard sack of Teddy Bridgewater that knocked the Saints out of field goal range and gave the Cowboys a chance to win with a field goal in the final 2 minutes.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe passing game is showing signs of missing Michael Gallup, who could be out another two weeks with a knee injury. The average yardage per pass play was 10.7 yards in two games with the second-year receiver. It\u2019s 7.2 yards per pass play without Gallup.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nRobert Quinn has three sacks in two games with Dallas since returning from a two-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s policy on performance-enhancers. The ninth-year pro has looked even more dominant than DeMarcus Lawrence, who has two sacks in four games after signing a $105 million contract in the offseason.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nConnections with Randall Cobb. The veteran slot receiver had a third-down drop that contributed to a sputtering offense, and Prescott misfired on a throw to Cobb in the back of the end zone, forcing Dallas to settle for a 3-0 lead in the first quarter.\n\nINJURIES\n\nLT Tyron Smith sprained his right ankle when Prescott was sacked on the first play of the final series. Coach Jason Garrett didn\u2019t rule him out for this week. S Kavon Frazier is expected to miss the rest of the season with a torn pectoral muscle.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n36%. The Cowboys converted four of 11 third downs after leading the NFL through three games at 58%.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Cowboys face a division leader for the second straight week with Green Bay visiting Sunday. That\u2019s after opening with victories over three teams that are now a combined 2-10, including still-winless Washington and Miami. The Packers are also coming off their first loss.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jason Witten's rare fumble was the first sign the Dallas offense wasn't going to be quite the same against the New Orleans Saints after putting up big numbers each of the first three weeks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/cowboys_saints_football_37800_c0-190-4549-2842_s1770x1032.jpg?4eaef23d22cd861b9dc336700f27a21fb11a80f9", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
