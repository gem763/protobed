This time, the fate of the two-state solution, long accepted internationally as the basis for a resolution, is hanging in the balance after Mr. Netanyahu pledged to annex nearly a third of the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it will release its long-awaited peace plan after Israel votes.\n\nCampaigning, meanwhile, has focused on the politics of identity and a range of fears.\n\nFor some Netanyahu supporters, the Iranian threat is paramount, while his opponents from the center-left worry about the future of Israeli democracy. They accuse Mr. Netanyahu of trying to manipulate the news media and of undermining the judiciary and law enforcement as part of a bid to gain immunity from prosecution, including by calling to curb the powers of the Supreme Court. A hearing in his corruption cases is set for early October.\n\nFor many Israelis, this election offers a choice between a continuation of a rightward, religious shift or a return to a more liberal Israel. Some feel it\u2019s time for a change.", "description": "Israelis vote on Tuesday in the second election in five months.
