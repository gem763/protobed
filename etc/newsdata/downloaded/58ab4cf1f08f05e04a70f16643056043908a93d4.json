The winner of the ALCS will play the wild-card Washington Nationals, who swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS.\n\nThe Yankees grabbed an early 1-0 lead in the first inning after Astros starter Zack Greinke walked Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner with the bases loaded. Greinke lasted only 4 1/3 innings, allowing one earned run on three hits. He struck out five and walked four.\n\nIn the third, Springer jumped on an 86-mph splitter from Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka and sent a shot over the left-field wall, giving Houston a 3-1 lead. Tanaka gave up three earned runs on four hits across five innings. He recorded one strikeout and walked two.\n\nCorrea, facing Yankees reliever Chad Green, pushed the Astros\u2019 lead to 6-1 with his own three-run homer in the top of the sixth. Later in the inning, New York\u2019s Gary Sanchez answered with a two-run home run to left, trimming the Yankees\u2019 deficit to 6-3.\n\nThe Astros plated two more runs in the eighth and ninth after an error by Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres and an RBI single from Michael Brantley, sealing the 8-3 victory.\n\nGame 5 of the best-of-seven series is scheduled for Friday night at Yankee Stadium. The Astros are expected to send Justin Verlander to the mound against Yankees starter James Paxton.", "description": "Oct. 18 (UPI) \u2014 Carlos Correa and George Springer each blasted three-run homers as the Houston Astros slugged their way to an 8-3 win over the New", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
