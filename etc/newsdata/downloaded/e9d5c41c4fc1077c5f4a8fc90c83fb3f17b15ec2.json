The clothing was deliberately voluminous and oversized, playing with proportion to subvert the female form and ideas of beauty. For Kawakubo, fashion was not about making the body look good; it was about using the body as a canvas for her \u201cwearable abstractions\u201d, as she once put it. Opening a boutique in Paris in 1981, she quickly gained notoriety for her anarchic chic.\n\nRei Kawakubo in 2016, wearing a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons leather jacket. Getty\n\nAfter his failed interview, Taka went on to work in various boutiques across Tokyo and, in 1986, began collecting Comme.\n\n\u201cAt the start I was just buying things to wear,\u201d he says, noting that he took advantage of Kawakubo\u2019s \u201cshapeless, baggy, black, genderless\u201d pieces. But in 1986, when her womenswear became more overtly feminine \u2013 with bias-cut dresses, for example \u2013 he turned his sights to collecting.\n\n\u201cI just had to have them. Something pushed me and I\u2026 I just had to have them.\u201d\n\nTakahashi has about 100 Comme garments from almost every collection Kawakubo has shown. Eugene Hyland\n\nAs his collection grew, he would invite his female friends around for dress-up parties. \u201cI wanted to see them on! And they\u2019re too tight for me. I wanted to see them, not on a mannequin but on a woman. You want to see the way the dress moves.\u201d\n\nIf someone can be inspired by the collection to create something new and beautiful, then I would be very happy. \u2014 Takamasa Takahashi\n\nThese days, Taka has about 100 Comme pieces from almost every collection Kawakubo has presented. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too keen on the 2D collection from 2012. But of course I still bought a piece,\u201d he says, laughing.\n\nThis number does not include the items he has donated to the NGV and Canberra\u2019s National Gallery of Australia, of which he says he\u2019s lost count. He began donating them in 2005 after moving with long-time partner David Tune to the Gold Coast and noticing they were attracting mould in the humidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoving to Australia in 1989 made collecting Comme more difficult. He eventually found it stocked by the boutiques Trellini in Melbourne and Five Way Fusion in Sydney \u2013 \u201cbut, you know, at three times the Japanese price\u201d. So he enlisted a friend employed by the brand in Japan to hold pieces aside until other friends could then send them over. \u201cThey all knew the love I had for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. It was very kind of them.\u201d\n\nTop and skirt (1996) from the Body Meets Dress \u2013 Dress Meets Body collection, spring/summer 1997.\n\nEverything changed when eBay launched. \u201cThen,\u201d he says, gesturing with his hands, \u201cboom!\u201d When I ask what he thinks of the Melbourne Comme store, he is thrown; he didn\u2019t know there was one. \u201cOh my God!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cThat is great news.\u201d\n\nAs for financing all this high fashion \u2013 ready-to-wear pieces retail around the $1500 mark \u2013 Taka insists he is not rich but that \u201cfashion was everything to me. All of my pay \u2026 sort of just went to Comme. I needed to buy [the pieces]. I don\u2019t know what the drive was, but I really wanted them. You know, one season ends and then you can\u2019t get it any more. So it was important for me to have at least a few pieces from each season.\u201d\n\nI only wear Comme in Melbourne, and in Melbourne I only wear Comme. \u2014 Takamasa Takahashi\n\nThough Comme is sometimes criticised for being unwearable, Taka says this is missing the point. \u201cIt\u2019s not about wearability. It\u2019s about the challenge of creativity, it\u2019s about defining what is beautiful. And [Kawakubo] managed every season to create something completely different.\u201d\n\nRecently, Taka hasn\u2019t felt overly compelled to buy new pieces, noting that Kawakubo\u2019s work seems to be catering to younger customers. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons I used to know. But probably she\u2019s targeting a new generation, a new market. To me, people of my generation, we know what CDG is really about, and I don\u2019t see it these days.\u201d\n\n\"All of my pay \u2026 sort of just went to Comme,\" Takahasi recalls. Eugene Hyland\n\nWith the NGV exhibition opening next month, Taka has been reflecting on his collection. \u201cBack in the \u201980s, I just loved Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. I felt this sort of \u2026 quiet excitement when I saw the clothes,\u201d he says. \u201cRecently I've been wondering why I started.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something with the clothes, keep them, but I didn\u2019t know why. But I think donating them to the NGV has been the right thing. Because they can preserve them for future generations, and study them, and keep them for young fashion students. And if someone can be inspired by the collection to create something new and beautiful, then I would be very happy.\u201d\n\nJacket and blouse (2005), Broken Bride collection, autumn/winter 2005-2006.\n\nThe exhibition will feature about 60 pieces, along with footage of Kawakubo\u2019s shows. Taka \u2013 who will of course wear Comme to the opening (\u201cI only wear Comme in Melbourne, and in Melbourne I only wear Comme\u201d) \u2013 was blown away that Kawakubo\u2019s team replied to the NGV curators, given her reputation as publicity-averse.\n\n\u201cI was so surprised she even got back to them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you know, to me, that\u2019s part of her appeal. To me, Rei is very Japanese, she doesn\u2019t show her emotion much. I think there is a lot of power in that.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always said that hard work says everything. I think that\u2019s the perfect answer.\u201d\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nCollecting Comme at the NGV, November 1 to March 2020.", "description": "Takamasa Takahashi can barely explain his compulsion to collect the avant-garde Japanese label \u2013\u00a0but he\u2019s delighted the work is going on display at the NGV.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2233%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_80/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d7e6463f66cf0a25381404a8aa7550403943abfb", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
