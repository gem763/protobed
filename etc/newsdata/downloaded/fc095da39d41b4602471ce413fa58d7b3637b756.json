Fatigue is a common but serious condition that shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for our energy levels to dip, especially if we\u2019ve succumbed to those mid-year blues. We\u2019ve been working hard for months and there\u2019s no break in sight. We wake up tired, even after a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost motivation to begin the day and struggle with our every-day tasks. And to top it all it\u2019s winter \u2013 daylight hours are short and cold and flu season is taking its toll. Most of us know what it means to be tired from time to time, but if you\u2019re suffering from a constant lack of energy and ongoing fatigue, it may just be time to check in with your doctor.\n\nWHAT IS FATIGUE?\n\n\u201cIn its simplest definition, fatigue is a constant feeling of extreme tiredness or weakness that can be physical and mental,\u201d says Johannesburg-based GP, Dr Lerato Motimele. She says there are two main categories of fatigue \u2013 chronic, which is long term, and acute fatigue, which is short term.\n\n\u201cThe most common type affecting people is chronic fatigue resulting from extended periods of strain on the mind and body. These are from working extensively in high-pressure environments, working long hours without adequate breaks, poor lifestyle choices such as lack of sleep or excessive sleeping, poor eating habits and a sedentary way of life.\n\n\u201cIt can also come from a lack of human interaction due to a dominant working lifestyle, a lack of selfcare, or mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nMotimele says acute fatigue may result from a short-term illness like a viral infection, drugs, excessive alcohol intake or sudden strenuous physical activity. It may become chronic fatigue if not identified and managed in time.\n\nCAUSES OF FATIGUE\n\nFatigue can be caused by physical exhaustion or illness.\n\nPhysical fatigue \u201cThis is extreme exhaustion, usually caused by workstress,\u201d says Hope Poopedi, a psychologist at Voortrekker Hospital in Limpopo. \u201cIt can lead to you losing interest and to demotivation at work.\u201d It usually builds over a long period of time until you\u2019re completely drained. This type of fatigue is usually accompanied by worry and when diagnostic tests are done they come back normal, Poopedi says.\n\nMedical fatigue Unrelenting exhaustion may be a sign of a condition or an effect of the drugs or therapies used to treat it. Examples include anaemia, anxiety disorders, cancer, chronic infection or inflammation, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), depression, diabetes, obesity and stress. Medications and treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, pain drugs, heart drugs and antidepressants can also be the cause. This type of fatigue is usually accompanied by other symptoms. For example, if you have anaemia, you might also suffer from dizziness, heart palpitations, lightheadedness and fainting spells.\n\nYOUR EMOTIONAL WELLBEING\n\n\u201cPeople who are emotionally fatigued perpetually feel emotionally overextended. They just don\u2019t have the emotional resources to get through the day,\u201d says Johannesburg-based psychologist and researcher Elliott Kotze. Emotional fatigue is usually caused by excessive job or personal demands, being in a continuous state of stress or a combination of these. \u201cWith increasing financial stress, which has knock-on effects on other aspects of people\u2019s lives, emotional fatigue is the reality for many people,\u201d he says. For this, Kotze says the best treatment is rest.\n\n\u201cYou can treat depression, anxiety and insomnia with medication and therapy, but until you find ways to rest the problem won\u2019t go away. \u201cThis kind of fatigue tends to hit those of us who are overachievers or who engage passionately in their work. When you first notice the signs, you can very easily downscale them to laziness and push yourself to work harder, which makes everything worse and gets the person stuck in a toxic cycle.\u201d He suggests people should regularly check in with themselves about their emotional and physical wellbeing. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018How am I feeling today? What have my physical experiences been? How do I make sense of these?\u2019 If you find yourself justifying why you\u2019re feeling the way you feel, I think that\u2019s a clear sign to stop and reconsider why you\u2019re making the sacrifices you\u2019re making and whether or not they\u2019re benefitting you in the long run,\u201d he says.\n\nMANAGING YOUR FATIGUE\n\nFatigue isn\u2019t something you can just ignore and hope it goes away. \u201cA delay in managing fatigue can be harmful to your health and may even result in irreversible health implications,\u201d Motimele says. \u201cThe signs can all ultimately lead to burnout where the mind and body can no longer cope and signal you to stop overworking the body.\u201d\n\nKotze says fatigue is a symptom of an underlying problem so you need to identify the cause with the help of a healthcare professional. Essentially, you must know what type of fatigue you suffer from to receive the necessary treatment for it. \u201cThe management of it will usually be dictated by the underlying cause. For example, if lack of sleep is the cause, a healthcare professional can assist in investigating the primary cause, which may be working at night when the body is programmed to sleep, insomnia, taking stimulants that inhibit sleep, anxiety or maybe depression.\u201d\n\nDo what you need to do but take care of yourself, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to increase physical activity levels because it increases your endorphin (a group of hormones secreted within the brain and nervous system) levels and gives you a bit more energy. But sometimes the fatigue is so extensive you can\u2019t convince yourself to go out and be active. So, my advice is to engage in activities, people or experiences that make you feel happy and relaxed.\u201d\n\nHe adds that you must listen to your body \u2013 if you feel really exhausted, give yourself a break from people. Counselling and medication might also be necessary as you allow yourself to go through the emotions.", "description": "Has your enthusiasm been replaced by exhaustion?
