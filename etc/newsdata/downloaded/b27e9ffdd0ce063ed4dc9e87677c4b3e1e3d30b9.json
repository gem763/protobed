(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThis morning, NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued a new statement about Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s support for protesters in Hong Kong, and it is a somewhat better one, declaring, \u201cThe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn that statement, Silver sounds like a man who wants to do the right thing but realizes that doing so will cost his organization a fortune and perhaps even endanger people. Silver continued to try to talk a tightrope Tuesday at a news conference in Tokyo before a preseason game between the Rockets and NBA champion Toronto Raptors.\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI regret \u2014 again, having communicated directly with many friends in China \u2014 that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans. At the end of the day, we come with basketball as an opportunity to sell dreams, sell hopes . . . that we are causing disruption in people\u2019s lives and that we are causing disharmony, that\u2019s something I regret.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cops are shooting people from point-blank range in Hong Kong. Disruption and disharmony are already here. The question is what the NBA\u2019s players, coaches, managers, owners, and officials are willing to do in response to this disruption and disharmony. (A more serious comment from the President of the United States wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in May, I went back to the arguments American policymakers had with themselves in the 1990s as they contemplated extending \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d status to China, and then \u201cpermanent normal trade relations.\u201d Something weird happened when chief executives of American companies discussed China back then. They kept describing a market of a billion new customers, as if the average Chinese citizen was awash in disposable income. They pictured a China full of people eating American soybeans, drinking Coke, wearing blue jeans made with American cotton, celebrating with American bourbon and riding on Boeing airplanes.\n\nAmerica\u2019s policymakers, by and large, agreed. Here\u2019s Bill Clinton describing America\u2019s future relationship with China in 2000, after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed Permanent Normal Trade Relations:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith more than a billion people, China is the largest new market in the world. Our administration has negotiated an agreement that will open China\u2019s markets to American products made on American soil, everything from corn to chemicals to computers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBringing China into the WTO and normalizing trade will strengthen those who fight for the environment, for labor standards, for human rights, for the rule of law . . . At this stage in China\u2019s development, we will have a more positive influence with an outstretched hand than with a clenched fist.\n\nClinton hailed the deal as a step to \u201ca China that is more open to our products and more respectful of the rule of law at home and abroad.\u201d And from that year on, America\u2019s trade relationship with China was \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nExcept . . . China wasn\u2019t a \u201cnormal\u201d country, and it never was one. Only a few decades earlier, the Chinese regime had perpetrated some of the greatest horrors of the century upon its people \u2014 the Great Chinese Famine \u2014 which killed tens of millions! \u2014 the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution. The Tiananmen Square massacre had just been a few years earlier. It still had political prisoners and a police state, it was slowly but steadily building up its military, it still harvested organs from prisoners in its jails. And yet most of America\u2019s political and business leaders looked across the Pacific, averted their eyes from the draconian human rights abuses, focused relentlessly on that growing economy and potential billion customers and declared, \u201cwe can do business with these people.\u201d And they told the rest of us to trust them. Oh, and Bill Clinton assured us that money donated by Chinese citizens in his reelection campaign had never influenced his thinking about China. Even though in 1992, he had campaigned as a tough critic of China and called George H.W. Bush as too soft on the regime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing could seem to dissuade America\u2019s business leaders when it came to their vision of an endlessly mutually profitable relationship with the regime. We kept being told how absolutely ruthless and relentless the Chinese efforts at corporate espionage were, and how brazenly and defiantly they stole patents, blueprints, and intellectual property. I don\u2019t know about you, but when somebody steals from me, I don\u2019t want to keep doing business with them. Yet America\u2019s business leaders never seemed to experience anything that made them conclude the regime is so bad that it\u2019s not worth doing business with them. There was this consistently weird disconnect in the comments from American business leaders, as they kept saying their Chinese competitors were overtly or secretly state-subsided, or would complain about corruption . . . but no one wanted to stop putting more resources there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as companies became more economically entangled with China, they stopped having any interest in uttering a critical word about China. You stopped hearing about Tibet, or the Falun Gong. As Chinese government started assembling a surveillance network that would make George Orwell gasp, American companies were happy to supply the tech. The employees and leaders of Google didn\u2019t renew a deal with the U.S. Pentagon, contending the Pentagon\u2019s use of their artificial intelligence tech violated their moral principles. But the company didn\u2019t see working with the Chinese military as similarly problematic. (Back in the early days of the war on terror, some of us would scoff about self-proclaimed peace activists that they weren\u2019t anti-war, they were just pro-the-other-side.)\n\nAmericans don\u2019t like thinking about trade policy. It\u2019s a topic so inherently boring that it can bog down the excitement of a Star Wars prequel. Americans would much rather think about fun topics, like basketball and movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the business world\u2019s rosy view of China started manifesting itself in strange new ways. The remake of \u201cRed Dawn\u201d at first imagined China invading was suddenly and hastily rewritten to depict tiny North Korea invading and attempting to conquer the United States. An Iron Man sequel featured this weird, tacked-on subplot about a Chinese surgeon saving his life, and the Chinese version of the film was even more disjointed and heavy-handed. A Transformers sequel replaced Michael Bay\u2019s usual slow-motion tributes to American military hardware with weirdly discordant shots of Chinese officials pledging to protect Hong Kong from rampaging Decepticons. The one Chinese film star that most American audiences might recognize \u2014 Fin Bangbang, who played the voiceless mutant Blink in X-Men: Days of Future Past, just disappeared for a few months; the Chinese government later announced she had been put under house arrest for alleged tax evasion. No one in Hollywood mentioned her in their awards speeches or organized any protests.\n\nHollywood stars never hesitated to denounce any Republican president in the harshest of terms, but the only big star still publicly critical of the Chinese government is Richard Gere. Financial incentives for big institutions like movie and television studios created incentives for self-censorship that are probably even more effective than a police state. Some people will defy a police state out of inherent rebelliousness or irritation with authority. But everybody hates to walk away from a potential fortune \u2014 and for every major player in Hollywood, China represents a potential fortune and investors in future films.\n\nA proposed law that would allow Hong Kong cops to send arrested suspects to mainland China turned into a flashpoint, an increasingly violent conflict between the people of Hong Kong and the authoritarian rulers of China, who cannot accept any form of defiance of their power. One general manager of one National Basketball Association team put out one Tweet, and since then, the NBA has worked overtime to demonstrate our new cultural power structure.\n\nCriticism of the Chinese government is forbidden \u2014 I don\u2019t mean in China, I mean de facto in the United States for anyone who is part of any institution that has any investment in China. The sports league that prides itself on freedom of expression and social relevance \u2014 one so politically correct that it banned the word \u201cowner\u201d because the term allegedly evokes slavery \u2014 has no one willing to say Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey is right and that people around the world should, as he tweeted, \u201cfight for Freedom\u201d and \u201cstand with Hong Kong.\u201d As of this writing, not a single player, not a single coach, not a single owner has spoken out in support of Morey. You couldn\u2019t get all those guys to agree on any topic in domestic American politics. But for the first forty-eight hours of this controversy, the opinion of everyone associated with the NBA was uniform. Our relationship with China has not made them more like us. It has made us more like them.\n\nThink about it: we have no shortage of professional athletes who are willing to publicly denounce American cops who they deem abusive and brutal. But everybody\u2019s looking at their shoes as the cops in Hong Kong beat the hell out of anybody in a mask and shoot people at point-blank range.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr has plenty to say when the topic is mass shootings, Donald Trump, or Colin Kaepernick. But suddenly he finds the topic of Hong Kong just too complicated and \u201cbizarre\u201d for him to comment. \u201cActually I don\u2019t,\u201d Kerr said when asked if he has thoughts on the controversy. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bizarre international story. A lot of us don\u2019t know what to make of it. It\u2019s something I\u2019m reading about like everybody is, but I\u2019m not gonna comment further.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime cracking down on protests and public expressions of dissent. Is that really . . . \u201cbizarre\u201d?\n\nADDENDA: In case you missed it yesterday, our foreign policy is muddled, because the public\u2019s views are muddled, because our leaders are afraid to tell voters things they don\u2019t want to hear; President Trump blindsides the Pentagon, which is the opposite of what you\u2019re supposed to do, and a cheap shot at Bernie Sanders on The Daily Show reveals the inherent danger of treating comedy shows as journalism.", "description": "This morning, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a new statement about Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s support for protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Andrew C.
