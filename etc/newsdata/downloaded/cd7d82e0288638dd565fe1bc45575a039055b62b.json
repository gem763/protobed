Here's an assessment of Arsenal's captains since the departure of Thierry Henry in 2007.\n\nGranit Xhaka's status as Arsenal captain is under threat after his actions against Crystal Palace\n\n2007-2008: William Gallas\n\nGallas was named Arsenal's new captain less than a year after joining from rivals Chelsea and wore the armband in the 2007-08 campaign, when Arsenal finished third in the league, four points adrift of champions Manchester United.\n\nIn February of that season, however, Gallas infamously sat down in the centre circle after Arsenal's 2-2 draw against Birmingham City, with that result proving costly in their title challenge.\n\nIn November 2008 Gallas was stripped of the armband after issuing derogatory comments about his team-mates in an interview, but he remained at the club until 2010.\n\nWilliam Gallas' time as Arsenal captain was defined by his sulk on the pitch versus Birmingham\n\n2008-2011: Cesc Fabregas\n\nFabregas, aged just 21 at the time, succeeded Gallas as Arsenal captain.\n\nThe Spaniard missed a host of games through injury during his time as skipper. He also produced some magical moments, including a game against Blackburn in 2009 when he scored once and provided four assists in a 6-2 victory and delivered a brilliant goal against Tottenham in the same year.\n\nSpeculation regarding a return to Barcelona refused to go away, however. Fabregas, who was injured at the time, angered supporters when he elected to attend the Spanish grand prix in 2011 instead of watching Arsenal's final game of the season away to Fulham. Later that summer Fabregas finally sealed his move back to Barcelona.\n\nFabregas enjoyed some excellent moments as Arsenal captain but then left for Barcelona\n\n2011-2012: Robin van Persie\n\nVan Persie, a more experienced captain, took over the armband for the 2011-12 season, and enjoyed an outstanding campaign on a personal level, scoring 37 goals in 48 games across all competitions, which included him winning the Premier League golden boot.\n\nAt times, van Persie single-handedly dragged Arsenal through games, helping them to finish third in the Premier League.\n\nArsenal's couldn't end their lengthy trophy drought under his guidance, however, and in the summer of 2012 van Persie left for Manchester United, with whom he won the Premier League title the following season.\n\nRobin van Persie was outstanding in the 2011-12 campaign prior to joining Manchester United\n\n2012-2014: Thomas Vermaelen\n\nVermaelen had already been at Arsenal for three years when he was named Arsenal captain.\n\nThe Belgian featured prominently in the first half of the 2012-13 season but was used more sporadically thereafter as he suffered several injuries and was also left out of the side on some occasions.\n\nVermaelen's passion and determination ensured he was a hit with Arsenal's fans, but Arsenal were still rather vulnerable defensively when he was in the side.\n\nArsenal won the FA Cup in 2014 - their first trophy for nine years - while Vermaelen was club captain, but he was actually an unused substitute for the final against Hull, with his successor Mikel Arteta captaining the side on the day.\n\nThomas Vermaelen spent much of his time as Arsenal captain on the sidelines\n\n2014-2016: Mikel Arteta\n\nAfter Vermaelen left for Barcelona, vastly experienced midfielder Arteta became Arsenal's captain on a permanent basis.\n\nMany of the club's younger players, such as Hector Bellerin, credited Arteta for helping them to feel at ease within the first-team setup.\n\nMuch of Arteta's work as Arsenal captain came off the field, however, as he struggled with injuries and often only featured fleetingly on the occasions that he was fit.\n\nArteta wasn't involved as Arsenal won the FA Cup final in 2015 against Aston Villa, but still lifted the trophy with Per Mertesacker after the game.\n\nMikel Arteta was praised by younger players such as Hector Bellerin for his impact as captain\n\n2016-2018: Per Mertesacker\n\nArteta retired from playing in 2016, becoming Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City, with Per Mertesacker being named as Arsenal's next captain.\n\nMertesacker had previously captained Arsenal on many occasions when Arteta was unavailable, but carried on Arteta's legacy by missing a host of games through injury while he was permanent captain.\n\nHe did, though, defy the odds to return from injury and produce an outstanding display in the FA Cup final as Arsenal defeated Chelsea in 2017.\n\nArsenal were certainly impressed with Mertesacker's leadership skills as he is still at the club as academy manager.\n\nPer Mertesacker won the 2017 FA Cup as Arsenal captain and is now head of the club's academy\n\n2018-2019: Laurent Koscielny\n\nKoscielny, who often played alongside Mertesacker at the heart of the defence, became the first captain of Unai Emery's tenure at Arsenal after Arsene Wenger's departure.\n\nEmery stressed a desire for collective leadership, with Petr Cech, Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Granit Xhaka also forming part of his captaincy group.\n\nAfter missing several months at the start of the season through injury, Koscielny returned to the side, but he couldn't prevent Arsenal from missing out on a Champions League place again, and also featured in the Europa League final defeat to Chelsea.\n\nThat proved to be Koscielny's last game for Arsenal, with his time at the club ending in acrimonious fashion after he refused to travel on the club's pre-season tour of the United States before eventually joining Bordeaux.\n\nLaurent Koscielny was the first captain of Unai Emery's tenure but left for Bordeaux\n\n2019-present: Granit Xhaka\n\nArsenal delayed naming a permanent successor to Koscielny, but following a bizarre situation which involved players voting for their preferred candidate, Xhaka got the armband, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Hector Bellerin and Ozil also being named in the captaincy group.\n\nUnlike many of his predecessors, Xhaka is a fixture in the side, having started the vast majority of Arsenal's Premier League games since joining the club in 2016.\n\nXhaka's spell as captain could come to an abrupt end, however, following his reaction to sections of the crowd booing him against Crystal Palace.", "description": "Just a month after he was officially confirmed as Arsenal's club captain, there is uncertainty over whether Granit Xhaka will keep the armband.", "authors": ["Jeorge Bird For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20286544-0-image-a-107_1572278664081.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
