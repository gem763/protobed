Car sales in 2018 declined from a year earlier, the first annual contraction since the 1990s against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a crippling trade war with the United States.\n\nSeptember and October, nicknamed \"Golden September, Silver October\" by China's auto insiders, are regarded as the high season for auto sales in the country, with customers traditionally returning to make purchases after summer.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe association had previously said it expected sales in the second half to improve, but that overall annual sales would fall 5per cent year-on-year to 26.68 million vehicles in 2019.\n\n\"Sales have risen in the second half but they have not hit expectations and the pace has been slow,\" said Chen Shihua, CAAM assistant secretary general.\n\nAs recently as three years ago automakers had enjoyed double-digit annual growth in China, before the brakes came on with the first annual contraction since the 1990s last year.\n\nFifteen cities and provinces which account for over 60 per cent of car sales in China implemented new vehicle emission standards earlier than the central government's 2020 deadline, hurting sales particularly of traditional-fuel vehicles, according to CAAM, analysts, dealers and consumers.\n\nSales of new energy vehicles, which China has been a keen supporter of, have also been impacted by subsidy cuts, falling 34.2 per cent in September following a 15.8per cent decline in August, CAAM said. NEV sales jumped almost 62 per cent last year as the broader auto market contracted.\n\nNEVs include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [SHANGHAI] Auto sales in China fell for a 15th consecutive month in September, data from the country's biggest auto industry association showed, dampening hopes for a second-half turnaround in the world's largest auto market. .
