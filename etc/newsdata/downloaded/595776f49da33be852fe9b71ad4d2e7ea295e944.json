My argument was simply that films that feature action or comedy or horror or spectacle have always been wildly popular with audiences even if they aren\u2019t realistic explorations of the human condition. In fact, I think they are popular because they are an escape from realism.\n\nToday the Hollywood Reporter noticed that this same argument about what is and isn\u2019t cinema has been going on for a long time. Back in 1983 when Return of the Jedi was released, ABC\u2019s Nightline featured a segment in which critic John Simon trashed the Star Wars films while Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert argued they were tremendous entertainment:\n\n\u201cI feel they are so bad because [Star Wars movies] are completely dehumanizing,\u201d said Simon, who at the time was the film critic for National Review and drama critic for New York Magazine. \u201cSpecial effects are the tail of the dog, which should not wag the whole animal. When you have a film that is 90 percent special effects \u2026 you might as well be watching an animated cartoon, because finally, all those special effects begin to look unreal.\u201d Calling stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford \u201cthree lousy actors,\u201d Simon argued the films were solely made for children and those should be the only people who got joy from them. But even then, Simon said Star Wars was not good for kids\u2026 \u201cI totally disagree with Mr. Simon,\u201d began Ebert, long-time critic for the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did as a child, but I spent a lot of my Saturday matinees watching science fiction movies and serials and having a great time and being stimulated and having my imagination stimulated and having all sorts of visions take place in my mind that would help me to become an adult and to still stay young at heart.\u201d\u2026 Ebert continued, \u201cI also enjoy films by Ingmar Bergman and people like that. I share that taste with Mr. Simon, but I try, I think in my own moviegoing taste, to be broad enough to try and understand why a bunch of people would want to get together and see a Star Wars movie and enjoy it.\u201d\n\nEbert connected Star Wars to all the fun science fiction and fantasy that had come before it. If you\u2019re a Star Wars fan, you probably already know that the inspiration for the films (and for the Indiana Jones movies) came from serials George Lucas had seen as a child.\n\nLike Ebert, I enjoy films by Ingmar Bergman, Michaelangelo Antonioni, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and Akira Kurosawa to name a few. If you want some depressing insight into humanity I\u2019d recommend The Bicycle Thief or Aguirre, the Wrath of God. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying a Marvel movie because movies have never been just about what we are. They\u2019ve always been about what we hope, and fear, and what makes us laugh.\n\nThe grand figures of Hollywood have never liked popular entertainment. The films that make all the money rarely get any love at the Academy Awards. I think it\u2019s largely because a lot of Academy voters are simply snobs. The audience may not always be right about any particular film (I still can\u2019t understand how anyone thought Prometheus was a good movie), but in general, the audience is right to love science fiction, horror, comedy, rom coms, and all the other genre films that someone somewhere has probably derided as \u201cnot cinema.\u201d\n\nIf Roger Ebert were still around I think he\u2019d be disagreeing with Martin Scorsese. Indeed, Ebert gave Iron Man a four-star review back in 2008.", "description": "\"I spent a lot of my Saturday matinees watching science fiction movies and serials and having a great time\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Roger-Ebert.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
