If Republican leaders say climate change is exaggerated and the scientists are untrustworthy, people follow. Polling data shows that Republicans have consistently considered climate change a low-priority issue, while Democrats put it much higher.\n\nAnother tactic of the political right was to create a phoney scandal that became known as Climategate, the result of which was to sow doubt about the credibility of scientists and distract from their message. In late 2009, hackers stole thousands of private email messages from climate groups at the University of East Anglia in England and at Penn State University. Nothing obviously incriminating turned up, but by twisting out-of-context words, like harping on someone's \"trick\" for graphing, pundits were able to create the impression that the scientists did something wrong and were not to be trusted. Multiple investigations cleared everyone except the hackers, who were never caught.\n\nDonald and Melania Trump meet people affected by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. SUSAN WALSH\n\nThis non-scandal tied in with a trend towards accusing scientists and science popularisers of being dishonest when they talked about natural disasters. Pundits criticised Al Gore for suggesting in his 2006 film that Hurricane Katrina might have had something to do with global warming. Even The Wall Street Journal bought into this unfair science-bashing, along with the myth that was Climategate.\n\nAs a political strategy, discrediting those who talked about natural disasters was effective. Floods, fires and storms make for a powerful way to bring home the dangers of climate change, making it something people can see on their television screens.\n\nIt is clear that global warming is having an effect on the strength and frequency of hurricanes. RICK WILKING\n\nThere was also a grain of truth to the criticism. It really is impossible to attribute any one hurricane to global warming. The problem was that people were asking the wrong question, says Leiserowitz. They were asking whether global warming caused Hurricane Katrina, for example, when they should have been asking whether global warming was having an effect on the strength and frequency of hurricanes. It is.\n\nIt's a little like asking if smoking caused a particular person's case of lung cancer, he says. Some people do get lung cancer without smoking, and some people who smoke never get cancer, but overall the statistical evidence is overwhelming that smoking increases a person's cancer risk. In the same way, human-generated climate change is shifting the background conditions. There's more energy trapped in the ocean and atmosphere, and that's leaving a thumbprint on the weather, extreme and otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt might seem contradictory that people could be gullible enough to fall for Climategate but still sophisticated enough to understand such a statistical argument, but the phenomenon known as motivated reasoning often allows smart people to believe things based on selective evidence.\n\nPublic opinion started to change when scientists began to talk about natural disasters again; unabashedly giving statistical evidence. After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston in 2017, for example, Keven Trenberth (one of the researchers falsely implicated in Climategate) came forward explaining in detail the complex way that warming oceans and changing wind patterns made a disaster like Harvey more likely.\n\nMany young people, such as climate activist Greta Thunberg, are fired up about climate change. The Canadian Press\n\nBelieving in the problem isn't enough to spur action, but it's a vital first step. Many people are now clamouring for action, thanks in part to the popular notion that the next 11 years are critical for minimising the impacts of global warming. It's a nice, manageable number: a short enough window to be challenging but long enough to seem doable. There's a concrete goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees. And there are now proposed solutions, such as the Green New Deal, which, while perhaps not perfectly practical, give people a goal with a name.\n\nA decade ago, scientists would complain that conservatives had bogged everyone down in a false debate over whether human-generated global warming existed when we should have been debating what to do about it. But even if acceptance had come earlier, it's hard to get people motivated to care about a problem if they're simply bludgeoned with guilt and fear.\n\nNothing like this has ever happened \u2013 there's never been a problem on this scale that calls out for coordinated global action. The ozone hole was a global problem, but it required substitutes for a few industrial chemicals, not a full-scale effort to change the energy sources that support the world economy. But lots of younger people are fired up to do what needs to be done over the next 11 years. There's nothing quite like the power of a deadline.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "There's nothing like a deadline to spur people into action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2673%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/be013487ebcf866189c7ea402ea9de6be7bfd1b2", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
