Through the semi-transparent tarp tossed overtop, you could see a pixelated version of the very same clubhouse as cameras captured his teammates celebrating around him.\n\nHe answered questions dutifully but succinctly.\n\nDoes he ever step back and take stock of his historic run of dominance, now extending his own record to 11 straight starts with at least 10 strikeouts?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cToo busy!\u201d\n\nAt any point Thursday, when he would be pitching in a win-or-go-home ALDS Game 5 against the Tampa Bay Rays to keep his team\u2019s very real World Series dreams alive, did he feel nervous?\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIs this the most fun he\u2019s ever had playing baseball?\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nCould he have pitched the ninth?\n\n\u201cIf they let me.\u201d\n\n(\u201cNo, he was done. He was done,\u201d his manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cI couldn't get far enough on the field to shake his hand to make sure that everybody knew he wasn't going to go back out.\u201d)\n\nIn the second inning of the game, he got burned on a 95-mph fastball that Eric Sogard sent into the seats for the only run the Rays scored on the night; by the eighth inning, he was throwing 99 mph \u2014 was that because he got looser or felt more fired up?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what I do,\u201d Cole said. And then, seizing on a lull in the scrum that had formed around him, \u201cAre we good?\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd with that, the gaggle of reporters wearing raincoats to protect their business casual from cascades of champagne let Cole go join his teammates. All things considered, the raincoats were probably overkill and the celebration comparatively subdued. Not because the Astros necessarily expected to win this series \u2014 at least they wouldn\u2019t say so publicly after losing Games 3 and 4 at Tropicana Field \u2014 but because two years removed from a World Series title, they know to pace themselves.\n\nWe let him go because what else was there for Cole to say about how the 107-win Astros walked away with a 6-1 victory \u2014 holding a lead from the first inning on \u2014 when at every turn the explanation seems to be that they simply tried to do winning things and it worked? I\u2019m sure that within each player there is plenty of pathos, but taken as a whole, the Astros are almost infuriatingly successful at optimizing baseball best practices. In an overly reductive retelling of what was in fact a book-worthy process that saw them practically invent the rebuild, the Astros were bad for a while so they could be good for hopefully longer, and now they are reaping those benefits while continuing to look for any edge at all times.\n\nWatching the Nationals take down the 106-win, two-time NL Champion Dodgers Wednesday night, Hinch found himself texting Alex Bregman about how \u201canything can happen during a given game.\u201d But for the winner-take-all matchup at Minute Maid Park, the Astros had a very specific reason to feel confident.\n\n\u201cWhen we have Gerrit Cole on the mound, we win,\u201d Hinch said postgame. It\u2019s a streak that could come to an end as the Astros face increasingly talented teams this October, but for months, it really has been that simple. Cole hasn\u2019t lost a decision since May. Including Thursday night, the Astros have won his last 15 starts. Winning: it\u2019s just what he does.\n\nGerrit Cole reacts after a double play ends the top of the seventh inning during Game 5 of the ALDS between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park on Thursday, October 10, 2019 in Houston, Texas. (Getty Images)\n\nIn the first eight innings of the decisive Game 5, the Rays used nine pitchers. The Astros used just one. This is not so much a metaphor as it is a direct microcosm of each team\u2019s mentality. The Big Three vs. the bullpen game, sure. But beyond that, too. The Astros have worked to build a burgeoning dynasty that relies on consistency \u2014 they\u2019ve won over 100 games three seasons running and on Thursday night their starting nine included seven players who were on the team or in the organization for their 2017 championship.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rays found themselves with the exact same stakes despite not having appeared in the playoffs since 2013 and quite literally having never won 100 regular season games. And, for comparison\u2019s sake, only two players in their starting nine that were with the team when the Astros won in 2017.\n\nIt is most remarkable that Cole pitched as well as he did, and the bulk of this story will be dedicated to him. But honorable mention goes to the fact that seven of the Rays pitchers during those first eight innings held the mighty \u2018Stros scoreless. A parade of largely anonymous relievers (plus one reigning Cy Young award winner) didn\u2019t work to get a win when the Rays needed it most. But unfortunately for traditionalists, it worked better than you might\u2019ve thought if you were only watching Kevin Cash create and then tread a well-worn path between the visiting team dugout and the mound.\n\n\u201cThey had guys up every inning,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe were spending just as much time looking on the TV monitor to see who was warming up and what they possibly were going to do than even watching what was going on in the field. That preparation is exhausting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce [Cash] made his first move, I knew that it was going to be a bullpen game like we had in Game 4,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cSo before that started I wanted to score as many runs as early as possible because they\u2019re so good at matching up.\u201d\n\nHis praise was spot-on. For six innings, Tampa bobbed and weaved their bullpen to keep the Astros from extending their initial lead until a pair of solo shots in the eighth gave the crowd an opportunity to roar their excitement at the impending advancement to the ALCS.\n\nBut what about that strategy? Scoring a lot of runs very quickly does seem like a good way to win baseball games, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. What makes the Astros different is that they just went out and executed the plan \u2014 with a little help from the opposing pitcher and an industrious sense to seize an opportunity.\n\nAfter the game, Bregman, who hit a two-run double as part of the four-run first inning, denied that the Astros were able to detect what Rays\u2019 starter Tyler Glasnow was about to throw. But Glasnow, who posted a staggering 1.78 ERA in an injury-abbreviated 60 2/3 innings this season, was less circumspect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d he said of tipping his pitches. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s worse, sometimes it\u2019s not, but today it was relatively obvious.\u201d He said he noticed it rewatching Bregman\u2019s at-bat but that he struggles to adjust his motion mid-game.\n\n\u201cTrying to fix that while you\u2019re pitching, it\u2019s just such a rhythm, timing thing,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to change even if you know you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nEven after Glasnow was pulled, the Rays appeared to be running through multiple pitch signs \u2014 even when there wasn\u2019t a runner on second. Tampa\u2019s ace, Blake Snell, who threw a scoreless inning in relief, addressed the speculation that the Astros were stealing signs.\n\n\u201cThis is a team that\u2019s gonna do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna try to find a way to find every advantage, and they\u2019re definitely going to try to steal signs. That\u2019s just what they\u2019re known for.\u201d\n\nStealing signs, and winning.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "How Gerrit Cole and the industrious Astros kept their march toward the World Series going in do-or-die Game 5.", "authors": ["Hannah Keyser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IJ5UNLEWYNATrU1iLKOvkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/khpykGKuXJftchH6ypigFQ--~B/aD0yNTIyO3c9Mzc4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1bef9cc0-ebca-11e9-aedb-c42584b0fe3d", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
