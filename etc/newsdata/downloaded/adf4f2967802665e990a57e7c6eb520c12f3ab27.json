Gibson said on Friday. \"This week\u2019s U.S. sanctions on two COSCO subsidiaries added more fuel to the fire.\"\n\nSupertanker rates on the benchmark Middle East Gulf to China route soared to $51,480 a day and were at their highest in nearly 11 months, Baltic Exchange data showed later on Friday.\n\nShipping sources added that tanker derivatives rates for the fourth quarter of 2019 - which give an indication of forward rate expectations - also rose on Friday to 88 Worldscale points, from 85 on Thursday.\n\nThe rates for loading Middle East crude to west coast India in the second week of October jumped 28% to 80-92.5 points after Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> booked two supertankers overnight, industry sources said.\n\nBut there was also uncertainty over how widely the sanctions on the COSCO units - COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co, Ltd and its subsidiary COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co, Ltd - would be implemented.\n\nCOSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) owns and manages at least 36 tankers for crude and refined products, including 18 VLCCs, according to shipping sources and Refinitiv data.\n\nAt least three ships linked to COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) scheduled to load oil from the United States and Brazil were canceled, oil and shipping sources said.\n\n\"There's confusion in the market for those who has fixed the COSCO's vessels. Everyone wants to avoid exposure to U.S. sanctions,\" a Singapore-based trader said.\n\nProvisional bookings for VLCCs Cosmerry Lake and Yuan Qiu Hu to load U.S. oil in the second half of October were scrapped.\n\nCosmerry Lake, owned by Cosmerry Lake Maritime Inc and managed by COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian), is floating off the U.S. Gulf. Yuan Qiu Hu, owned and managed by COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian), is on its way to the U.S. Gulf.\n\nA third COSCO-linked supertanker was chartered to load in Brazil, but it has been replaced by another vessel, a source with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nContacted by Reuters, an official at COSCO said the impact of the sanctions was being examined.\n\n\"(The) company is assessing the situation and impact internally as soon as possible, but so far we don't have anything to update you,\" said Zhang Zheng, an investor relations official with COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation <1138.HK>, parent of COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co, Ltd.\n\nTrading in shares of COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation was halted on Thursday after the news on the sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nREFINERS\n\nIndustry sources said some buyers were holding off while they check with legal teams to better understand the impact of the sanctions.\n\n\"The market is fearful of sanctions so refiners are taking some preventive measures. We'll have to see how widely implemented the sanctions will be,\" said KY Lin, spokesman for Taiwanese refiner Formosa Petrochemical <6505.TW>, a major crude oil buyer in Asia.\n\nStory continues", "description": "SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Key oil freight rates from the Middle East to Asia rocketed as much as 28% on Friday in a global oil shipping market spooked by United States sanctions on units of Chinese giant COSCO for alleged involvement in ferrying crude out of Iran.
