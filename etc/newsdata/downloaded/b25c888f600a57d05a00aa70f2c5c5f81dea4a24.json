(AP) - Rhode Island health officials have issued emergency health regulations to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in the state.\n\nThe health department regulations, issued Friday, ban the manufacture, distribution and sale of vaping products for four months.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gina Raimondo says she wants to ensure companies can\u2019t market these products with colorful packaging and candy-based flavors. She\u2019s concerned about the rapid increase and effects of electronic cigarette use among youth.\n\nDispensaries selling vaping products to registered medical marijuana patients and licensed cultivators are exempt.\n\nIn neighboring Massachusetts, a federal judge upheld the state\u2019s four-month ban on the sale of all vaping products Friday, at least for now. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker declared a public health emergency last week because of reported cases of lung illness caused by e-cigarettes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rhode Island health officials have issued emergency health regulations to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in the state.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
