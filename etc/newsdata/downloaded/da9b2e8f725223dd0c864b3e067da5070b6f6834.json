Much of the discussion was comprised of Iger recounting stories of business successes and failures that are told the book.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nHowever, according to Grazer, Iger\u2019s feelings about pizza delivery are not in the memoir and therefore should be revealed. For his part, Iger seemed quite emphatic about wanting to fetch his own pies. \u201cI like doing it,\u201d Iger said. \u201cI trust myself picking it up. It\u2019s not going to be turned upside down.\u201d\n\nGrazer also coaxed Iger to identify his favorite ride at Disneyland: Pirates of the Caribbean. \u201cIt was the last attraction Walt (Disney) created; it opened after he died,\u201d Iger said. \u201cIt still has an essence about it, a simplicity to it. Also sometimes it\u2019s just dark and quiet.\u201d\n\nIger also drew applause by offering his best imitation of the voice on the ride that intones: \u201cDead men tell no tales.\u201d Another burst of applause came when Iger talked about his pride in the success of Black Panther and its cultural importance. \u201cIt shut the naysayers up,\u201d Iger said.\n\nGrazer\u2019s questions were generally touchy-feely, but audience members did quiz Iger on a couple of business issues: The first was whether Family Guy and American Dad might appear on upcoming streaming service Disney+ along with The Simpsons. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Iger was noncommittal about the future of short-form content. \u201cRemember, Mickey Mouse is more short form than long form, he\u2019s mostly been in shorts. Shorts, and shorts,\u201d he added, referring to the Mouse\u2019s standard attire. But, seriously, \u201cI think it\u2019s a very different form of storytelling,\u201d Iger said. \u201cThe Simpsons started as short form.\u201d\n\nIger added that while it is harder to gain traction with story and character in short-form content, he said he expects the form to \u201chave impact\u201d in the future.\n\nAt the beginning of the discussion, Iger joked that he and his longtime friend Grazer were an unlikely pair: \u201cI\u2019m management and he\u2019s creative.\u201d Later, he described himself as a \u201cgenerally reserved person, I don\u2019t think I over-emote.\u201d He described that reserved quality as perhaps a liability when news is good, but an asset in failure because being negative does nothing to help inspire a creative team to further success.\n\nDespite his self-description, Iger seemed relaxed and often cracked wise in response to questions from Grazer and the audience. Someone\u2019s cell phone rang as Iger was talking about his relationship with the late Steve Jobs: \u201cI hope that\u2019s an iPhone,\u201d Iger said.\n\nWhen asked about his retirement plans after 45 years with one company, Iger said: \u201cI\u2019m going to Disneyland!\u201d\n\nAnd, when an audience member shouted out \u201c2020,\u201d as encouragement for Iger to re-think his decision not to run for president, Iger replied: That\u2019s a news show on ABC.\u201d\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
