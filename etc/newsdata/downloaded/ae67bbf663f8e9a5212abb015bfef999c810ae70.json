However, this was largely boosted by one-off special dividends and weakness from the pound.\n\nUnderlying dividends - that is, excluding special dividends - fell by 0.2 per cent to \u00a332.3billion, but were down by almost 3 per cent on a constant-currency basis - the worst quarterly performance for three years.\n\nUK dividends rose 6.9 per cent in between July and September but this was largely thanks to special dividend payments\n\nThis underlying weakness was slightly worse within the FTSE 100 after factoring in any exchange-rate impact, largely thanks to Vodafone's recent decision to slash its dividend by three fifths.\n\nCuts were also seen from household names across various industries such as Marks & Spencer, Superdry, and Dixons Carphone.\n\nMeanwhile, medium-sized companies saw their payouts drop by 1.7 per cent.\n\nMichael Kempe, chief operating officer at Link Market Services said: 'The predicted economic slowdown is beginning to show as UK company payouts falter after years of solid growth despite the gloss of huge special dividends and eye catching foreign exchange effects.\n\n'As the world economy falters and the UK remains mired in its political crisis, we are witnessing a significant slowdown in the UK's dividend growth rate. This is inevitable given the increasingly lacklustre performance companies are putting in on earnings.'\n\nThe group said the picture in the third quarter of this year supported its forecast for underlying dividend growth slowing down owing to a combination of wider global economic weakness and UK-specific factors related to the dampening effect on the economy of the intensifying political crisis.\n\nKempe added: '2019 will almost certainly prove a temporary high-water mark for UK dividends. Volatile specials are likely to revert towards the mean, and sterling is already partially pricing in a disorderly exit from the EU, so these more superficial factors will provide less cover for a more sluggish underlying performance in the year ahead.\n\n'Having said that, the yield on equities is extremely attractive. Dividends would have to fall far more even than during the severe recession a decade ago to bring the yield back into line with historic averages. A decline of that size is extremely unlikely.'\n\nGlobal dividend cover also on the rocks\n\nA separate report from the Henderson International Income Trust managed by Janus Henderson's Ben Lofthouse, showed global dividend cover will drop to 2.2 this year, its lowest level in ten years.\n\nDividend cover is the ratio of a company's earnings, that is its net income, over the dividend paid to shareholders, calculated as net profit or loss to ordinary shareholders by total ordinary dividend.\n\nProfits hit a record \u00a32.3trillion last year, and will grow again this year to \u00a32.4trillion. This means record dividends, topping \u00a31trillion for the first time.\n\nHowever, global dividend cover is due to fall to 2.2 times in 2019, thanks to a range of structural changes and cyclical factors.\n\nThe UK is among those with the lowest dividend cover in the world with dividend cover of just 1.6 times.\n\nThe 'deeply entrenched' dividend culture in the UK has historically been dominated by large oil and pharmaceutical companies, as well as banks and utilities, which are all mature, high-payout sectors.\n\nLofthouse said: 'If a company\u2019s profits are growing over the long term, then its dividends can grow sustainably too \u2013 meaning not just income for investors but capital gains too. Dividend yields are very attractive compared to prevailing interest rates, but investors need to tread carefully.\n\n'Typically, dividend cover rises quickly as an economy turns upwards. A long economic expansion is then associated with a steady decline in cover ratios as companies loosen the purse strings. And finally, an economic contraction causes sudden drops in dividend cover, before the process begins again.\n\n'We are not concerned about falling dividend cover because it was unnecessarily high in the past in some sectors and some parts of the world. Our analysis does indicate, however, that some countries and sectors are healthier than others.'\n\nBritish dividend payers look good value\n\nYields remain appealing in the UK though investors are still urged to be properly diversified across sectors and regions.\n\nAdrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, said: 'Current valuations in the UK market make equity income very attractive, with the yields still very appealing despite the obvious risks from Brexit and a wider slowdown.\n\n'It would be rash to abandon the UK at the moment as for income it looks exceptional value. However, if you are in need of income then the most important thing is to diversify your income streams to reduce volatility and dividend risks.\n\n'A global fund will achieve that, however there is likely to be some impact to returns if the pound rallies on an improved Brexit scenario.'\n\nDarius McDermott of Chelsea Financial Services, said there are good opportunities to be found in the more domestic parts of the market despite it being so unloved, while recommending some funds and trusts that could give investors a boost.\n\n'Dividend cover might be low but it isn't a disaster,' he said. 'UK equity income managers Job Curtis, of Janus Henderson, and Rathbone's Carl Stick say there will always be some parts of the market cutting their dividends but also others raising theirs.'\n\nDarius McDermott said dividend cover might be low but it is not a 'disaster'\n\n'Both managers run good UK income options with Stick's Rathbone Income fund yielding 4.3 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the closed-ended City of London investment trust is a good choice because trusts are able to keep revenue reserves in their income account should there be issues raising its dividend.'\n\nMcDermott also recommended Montanaro UK Income which is yielding 3.4 per cent and Man GLG UK Income with a yield just shy of 5 per cent.\n\nHe added: 'Yes cover is important but starting yields are higher and the UK has been so unloved that if we get some form of Brexit resolvement, we could see UK equities returning to a more global focus which could benefit the UK market.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "A report flashed warning signs that UK dividend growth is facing a 'fundamental slowdown', while a separate study said investors looking overseas could be hit by falling cover for payouts.", "authors": ["Jayna Rana For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
