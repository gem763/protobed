REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nUganda\u2019s Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo last Thursday said the government planned to re-introduce an anti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the spread of homosexuality in the east African nation.\n\nLokodo\u2019s statement was widely reported across the world and international donors such as the European Union, World Bank, the United States and the Global Fund said they were monitoring the situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people.\n\nA spokesperson for President Yoweri Museveni on Monday said the government has no plans to introduce the legislation that would impose the death penalty for gay sex.\n\n\u201cThere are no plans by the government to introduce a law like that,\u201d Don Wanyama, President Museveni\u2019s senior press secretary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe have the penal code that already handles issues of unnatural sexual behaviour so there is no law coming up.\u201d\n\nLokodo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation and local press last week that the bill was about to be tabled in the largely conservative Christian country where gay sex is currently punishable with life imprisonment under British colonial law.\n\nThis prompted major aid donors on Friday to voice concerns, and a government spokesman took to Twitter on Saturday to deny any such plan.\n\nIt was not possible to confirm any link between the donors\u2019 concerns and the government spokesman\u2019s statement on Saturday.\n\nVIOLENCE AND PREJUDICE\n\nWhen asked why Lokodo had made the statement, Wanyama said: \u201cAsk him. I don\u2019t know where he got this idea from. There is no plan by government to introduce a law of that nature.\u201d\n\nLokodo said the bill - that was nullified five years ago on a technicality - was being resurrected and would be voted on by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOur current penal law is limited. It only criminalises the act,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe want it made clear that anyone who is even involved in promotion and recruitment has to be criminalised. Those that do grave acts will be given the death sentence.\u201d\n\nLokodo did not immediately respond to calls and messages from the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Monday.\n\nEarlier this year, Brunei in Southeast Asia sparked international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only after intense criticism.\n\nAfrican countries have some of the world\u2019s most prohibitive laws governing homosexuality with same-sex relationships considered taboo and gay sex deemed a crime across most of the continent, with punishments ranging from imprisonment to death.\n\nUganda is seen as one of the most difficult countries in Africa to be in a sexual minority with members of the LGBT community facing prejudice in getting jobs, renting housing or seeking medical care or education.\n\nLGBT+ rights groups report that three gay men and one transgender woman had been killed in homophobic attacks in Uganda this year - the latest on Oct. 4 when a gay man was bludgeoned to death.\n\nRejected by their families and fearful for their lives, hundreds of LGBT+ Ugandans have fled over the last five years to seek refuge to countries such as neighbouring Kenya.\n\nHuman rights groups said Lokodo\u2019s comments would inflame homophobic attitudes further.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of how Uganda\u2019s politicians are stoking dangerous intolerance and bias against LGBTI people,\u201d said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International\u2019s director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, in a statement.", "description": "NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda will not impose the death penalty for gay sex, a presidential spokesman said on Monday, after major aid donors said they were monitoring a plan by the African nation to reintroduce a bill colloquially known as \"Kill the Gays\".", "authors": ["Nita Bhalla", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441047324&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0K4-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
