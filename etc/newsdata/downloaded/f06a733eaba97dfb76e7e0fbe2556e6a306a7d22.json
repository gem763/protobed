They were all laughing, that was one of the scariest things about it. Right away they were trying to get me in the head\u2019.\n\nMr Power, who is in his early 50s, said he believed the teens were trying to murder him.\n\nMarc Power thought he was meeting a date but instead was attacked by teens (Picture: Marc Power)\n\nThe teens fled when bystanders noticed the attack, and the victim was taken to hospital.\n\nHe said his car was destroyed in the attack and shared graphic images of his injuries on Facebook.\n\nHe described himself as a \u2018private person\u2019 but said he wanted to speak out about the attack to prevent something similar to happening to someone else.\n\nHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve lived abroad most of my life and never had any problems. Back in Ireland I\u2019ve had about three incidents. It makes me think about my own home city, and has it changed much. I\u2019ve no issues with my sexuality; other people do.\u2019\n\nGarda (Police) arrived at the scene about 10 minutes after the attack.\n\nMr Power was given an appointment for Wednesday next week to give a full statement and said he was disappointed it wasn\u2019t treated with more urgency.\n\nA spokesperson from Garda said investigations were ongoing.\n\nHe thought the teens were trying to murder him (Picture: Marc Power)\n\nMr Power said the incident would make him wearier of meeting up with people in the future, but he insisted he would not allow the assault to \u2018change who I am\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he criticised Gridnr for allowing people to open fake accounts.\n\nA spokesperson from the dating app said they were \u2018heartbroken\u2019 to hear about the incident and insisted they take measures to protect their users.\n\nThey added: \u2018We consistently look for ways to strengthen how we protect our users.\u2019\n\nThe Irish government are facing mounting pressure from LGBTQ+ organisations to introduce legislation making attacks motivated by homophobia or racism a hate crime.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Justice told the Irish Times research was being undertaken to look at how other countries had legislated for hate crimes.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
