Police responded for the most part with tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannon.\n\nAs criticism rose, police launched a spirited defence of their colleague saying he feared for his life and the safety of his colleagues.\n\n\"He only had one option, that is to fire the gun to immediately resolve the danger,\" deputy commissioner Tang Ping-keung told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe Junior Police Officer's Association also called on authorities to use colonial-era emergency regulations and impose a curfew as it launched a stinging attack on the city's pro-Beijing leaders.\n\n\"The Police force has been fighting alone,\" JPOA chairman Lam Chi-wai said, lamenting the lack of a political solution to the chaos.\n\n- 'Sick and tired' -\n\nOpinion towards Tuesday's shooting has largely cemented along ideological divides with pro-democracy activists condemning the police and establishment figures calling it a justified use of force.\n\nProtest groups said the officer charged into the melee with his firearm drawn and failed to fire a warning shot as they condemned the increasing use of live rounds.\n\n\"The people of Hong Kong are sick and tired of having mere words of condemnation as their only shields against lethal bullets and rifles,\" a masked protester said at a press conference near Tsang's school.\n\nMeanwhile lawyers acting for an Indonesian journalist who was shot in the face by a police rubber bullet on Sunday said doctors confirmed she would be at least partially blind in her right eye.\n\nTsang, who was filmed trying to strike the officer with a pole as he was shot, was taken to a nearby hospital in a critical condition but authorities said his condition had since improved.\n\nA friend and classmate of Tsang, who gave his first name Marco, said the 18-year-old was a keen basketballer who was infuriated by sliding freedoms in Hong Kong and the police response to the protests.\n\n\"If he sees any problems or anything unjust, he would face it bravely, speak up against it, instead of bearing it silently,\" Marco told AFP.\n\nPolice said 30 officers were injured in the National Day clashes, including some who suffered chemical burns from a corrosive liquid that was thrown at them by protesters. The liquid also wounded some journalists.\n\nHospital authorities said more than 70 people were admitted on Tuesday.\n\n- Record arrests and tear gas -\n\nOutlining the extent of Tuesday's clashes, police revealed that they arrested 269 people, ranging from 12 to 71 years old -- the largest daily toll since protests began.\n\nThey also unleashed a record 1,400 rounds of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets, 230 sponge rounds, 190 bean bag rounds and five live rounds as warning shots.\n\nPolice fired 1,000 tear gas canisters in the first two months of the protests.\n\nOn Wednesday, 96 protesters arrested on Sunday -- mostly students but also including a teacher, a doctor, and an advertising executive -- appeared in court charged with rioting.", "description": "Flash-mob rallies broke out in Hong Kong Wednesday as anger mounted over police shooting a teenage protester who attacked officers in a dramatic escalation of the violent unrest that has engulfed the territory for months.
