Is there any way I can get it for free?\n\nA: One of the simplest ways to get a bargain on Microsoft Office is to be a student at an accredited school. You can also open a Microsoft account and use their tools online, as long as you connect to Wi-Fi. Using this technique, you have the same access to Office that Gmail users have to Google Docs and other programs. The downside is that you won't be able to export a Word or Excel file, and you will run into several other roadblocks as well; in a way, your experience will be very similar to using a Chromebook. But you can\u2019t beat the price. Tap or click here for all the ways you can get Microsoft Office for free.\n\nRecord Calls\n\nQ: I would like to save individual phone calls. I looked in my Settings, but there is no option. How can I record calls on my smartphone?\n\nA: You have hit upon a common problem: recording calls on your cell phone is pretty tricky, and it has nothing to do with technology. The issue is legal; tech companies don\u2019t want to get involved in everyday users recording each other. Luckily, several third-party apps enable this very basic function, which is useful for interviews or other professional needs. Just remember, depending on your state\u2019s laws, you may need to alert the person at the other end that you\u2019re recording.

Keep in mind, though, that some regions have fewer stations, and if you live in a remote location, the signal may not be great. You may also struggle with an inferior antenna, which could require an upgrade to reach your TV\u2019s full potential. Much of the time, your most significant setback is the placement of your hardware.
