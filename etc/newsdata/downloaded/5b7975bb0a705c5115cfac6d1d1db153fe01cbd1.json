She left Britain claiming diplomatic immunity before she was interviewed by police.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, have urged US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to extradite Sacoolas to Britain, to no avail.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing claims against both Mrs. Sacoolas in the USA for civil damages as well as the Trump administration for their lawless misconduct and attempt to cover that up,\u201d family spokesman Radd Seiger said.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is not only hellbent on breaking international laws, rules and conventions on diplomatic immunity,\u201d he added, \u201cbut they have no care or concern for the welfare of Harry\u2019s family or any real intent on finding a solution.\u201d\n\nThe accident took place near a British airbase used by the US military as a communications hub and where 42-year-old Sacoolas\u2019s husband was stationed.\n\nThe case, which has generated huge public interest in Britain, has fueled tensions between London and Washington.\n\nTrump called the crash a \u201cterrible accident,\u201d saying it was common for Americans in Britain to have a hard time driving on the left side of the road.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents visited the White House October 15. They called Trump warm and welcoming but criticized the White House\u2019s attempts to engineer a snap meeting with Sacoolas, who was in a room next door with photographers.\n\nTim Dunn told Sky News the family were \u201cdisgusted\u201d and \u201cappalled\u201d at the suspect\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m angry that someone could do this and then get on a plane and go,\u201d he said.\n\nThe family has already filed a lawsuit against the British government for letting Sacoolas leave the country in the first place.\n\nBritish police announced last week that investigators will travel to the US to interview Sacoolas.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The family of a motorcyclist killed in a crash involving the wife of an American diplomat have announced they are planning to sue", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/d855d8_charlotte-charles-tim-dunn-asked-us-extradite-britain-american-suspected-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
