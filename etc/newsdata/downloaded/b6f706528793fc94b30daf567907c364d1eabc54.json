(Getty)\n\nAccording to the report, James expressed concern with Silver about players being put in a position of answering questions and representing the league overseas prior to the league making clear its stance on the controversy.\n\n\u201cBeing in China, where there was no way of knowing what the Chinese government was thinking or going to do next and the high stakes between the U.S. and China politically, it was almost impossible for these young players to manage through that situation,\u201d a source told Charania.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeBron supports united front on China: Report\n\nJames also told Silver he believed the teams and players were in this together and should present a united public front.\n\nHe did so while speaking to Silver in front of everybody in the room that included Lakers and Nets players, according to the report. A source told Charania that Silver \u201cworked with everyone in the room and heard them out.\u201d\n\nCharania also reports that Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma and Nets guard Kyrie Irving joined James in leading a players-only meeting after the initial meeting with Silver.\n\nESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols initially reported on the meeting with Silver last week. She reported that players in the meeting asked Silver if there would be repercussions for Morey, arguing that if a player\u2019s tweet had cost the league millions of dollars, that player would pay a price.\n\nChina questions have since been shut down\n\nSince that meeting, Rockets public relations shut down CNN\u2019s Christina Macfarlane when she asked Harden and Russell Westbrook at a news conference their thoughts on the China issue and players\u2019 freedom to speak about it.\n\nJournalist gets quickly shut down when she asked James Harden, Russell Westbrook if they would refrain from speaking out on politics/social justice after China debacle... pic.twitter.com/VkXSWo0N0s \u2014 gifdsports (@gifdsports) October 10, 2019\n\nA Rockets staffer announced that the news conference was for \u201cbasketball questions only.\u201d Harden and Westbrook did not respond when Macfarlane pressed. But the league said later the Rockets mishandled the situation.\n\nUPDATE: LeBron speaks\n\nBack in Los Angeles for a preseason game against the Golden State Warriors Monday, James spoke publicly about the subject for the first time.\n\nLeBron James on how he felt the NBA handled the situation in China and why he didn\u2019t speak out pic.twitter.com/6DYCAs96IW \u2014 Mark Medina (@MarkG_Medina) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cI think when we talk about the political side, I think it\u2019s a very delicate situation, a very sensitive situation,\u201d James said. \u201cMe personally ... when I speak about something, I speak about something I\u2019m very knowledgable about, something that hits home for me, something I\u2019m very passionate about. \u201cI felt like with this particular situation, there was something not only was I not informed enough about. I just felt like it was something that not only myself or my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time, and we still feel the same way.\u201d\n\nAsked about how the NBA handled the situation, James saved his criticism for Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to judge how the league handled the situation. I just think that when you\u2019re misinformed or you\u2019re not educated about something \u2014 I\u2019m just talking about the tweet itself \u2014 you never know the ramifications that can happen. We all see what that did \u2014 not only did for our league but for all of us in America and people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through the things that you say and may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. And I think that\u2019s just a prime example.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "LeBron James reportedly confronted Adam Silver over the China issue during a meeting among the Nets and Lakers.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UnIR1xL0l7m7211mF0EoJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/egvwz8sa278rBncW.FoS9g--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/253aaee0-eecd-11e9-95fe-1a17ebbbe191", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
