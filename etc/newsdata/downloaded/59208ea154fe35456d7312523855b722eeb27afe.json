Despite this, they confirmed Ms Von der Leyen, though by a narrow margin.\n\nOther than the French candidate, the parliament has also asserted itself in recent weeks by blocking the Hungarian and Romanian candidates for EU commissioner.\n\nRovana Plumb, nominated for the transport portfolio, and Laszlo Trocsanyi, nominated to be enlargement commissioner, were barred at the first stage by the parliament's legal affairs committee in late September over alleged conflicts of interest.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen's new Commission is due to take office on 1 November (EPA) More\n\nFrance, Romania, and Hungary now have to pick replacement candidates to be their commissioner who are more amenable to MEPs. MEPs are directly elected by the 28 member states every five years at the EU elections, the most recent of which were in May.\n\nEach EU member state gets to appoint one commissioner, though once they are in office they are bound serve the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home member states.\n\nThe Commissioners are allocated policy portfolios and meet collectively as the college of commissioners, effectively the Commission's cabinet.\n\nThe latest decision is not the first major blow Emmanuel Macron has faced this year in Brussels.\n\nIn June his pick to lead the new liberal group in the European Parliament, Nathalie Loiseau, was forced to quit the race after she insulted and alienated her allies in an off-the-record briefing.\n\nBoris Johnson has said the UK will not be nominating a commissioner to replace its current one, Julian King, who manages the security portfolio.\n\nRead more\n\nEU Commission rejects Brexit deadline set by Emmanuel Macron\n\nMacron may veto new Brexit extension because \u2018trust is missing\u2019\n\nMacron says France will block trade deal with Brazil over Amazon fires", "description": "France's pick for EU commissioner has been blocked by MEPs, dealing a major blow to Emmanuel Macron's political ambitions in Brussels.Sylvie Goulard was rejected in a secret ballot by the European Parliament's internal market and industry committees by 82 votes to 29, with one abstention.", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I9iWlmMVzDs0f32m5vdvZw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/035c422cdb2099f5812e630368ec9278", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
