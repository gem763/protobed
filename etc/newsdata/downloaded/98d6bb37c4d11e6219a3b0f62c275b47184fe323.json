In a letter to shareholders ahead of the earnings call, CEO Matt Maloney and CFO Adam DeWitt noted that the company would be boosting efforts to add non-partnered restaurants to the Grubhub platform.\n\nAt the end of the call, Maloney responded to an analyst\u2019s question on reasons as to why restaurants might want to be up-sold to pay to partner with Grubhub rather than selling through the platform as a non-partner.\n\n\u201cWhy would a restaurant choose to partner when they have a non-partner option? It\u2019s because the diner experience sucks,\u201d Maloney said, immediately eliciting laughter from a non-muted analyst. \u201cThe volume is going to be way lower, the food\u2019s not going to be as accurate \u2026 there\u2019s no way to fix the issues, it\u2019s less accurate delivery times, they\u2019re not going to have promotion on our platform.\u201d\n\nMaloney provided an example illuminating that by explaining that a Grubhub diner looking to order a cheeseburger would be directed to a paying partner restaurant instead of a non-partner restaurant.\n\n\u201cWe're going to do whatever we can to route demand to partnered restaurants where the economics are not so miserable and the experience is way better,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Maloney conceded the need to add non-partnered restaurants to its platform to offer choice to customers in an increasingly competitive environment, as Grubhub sees an increasingly large number of \u201cpromiscuous\u201d diners that are less loyal to just one food delivery platform. The company said that trend led to a 300 basis point impact to third-quarter growth, though it would be investing in loyalty programs in an effort to offset the drain.\n\nThird-party analytics platform Edison Trends has been documenting that trend for a while, with delivery competitor DoorDash accelerating its marketshare lead this year. As of October, the firm\u2019s data shows DoorDash growing its share of the delivery market from 28% in February to about 35% while Grubhub has retreated from 27% to 23% over the same time period.\n\nGrubhub has been losing delivery marketshare to delivery competitors Uber and DoorDash, according to Edison Trends. More\n\nWall Street was largely skeptical that Grubhub\u2019s plan might stop the bleeding, with analysts at Oppenheimer and Bank of America Merrill Lynch delivering rare double-downgrades on the stock to Underperform, the same day the stock closed lower by 43%.\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
