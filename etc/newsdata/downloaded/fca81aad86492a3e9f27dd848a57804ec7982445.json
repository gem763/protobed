And his refusal to play dirty politics \u2013 in contrast to the veteran politicians he was facing off against \u2013 inspired young voters to come out in record numbers.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for a leader that would be our person,\u201d said Aisha Pedican, a Toronto-based film-maker who was in her mid-20s the last time Canada went to the polls. \u201cI just remember thinking, \u2018Oh, this guy has a younger voice, I can relate to this.\u2019\u201d\n\nJagmeet Singh: pioneering party leader could be the Trudeau Canada hoped for Read more\n\nPedican recalls an electricity surrounding Trudeau\u2019s 2015 candidacy; he was a proudly progressive candidate who promised to fight climate change, repair a broken relationship with Indigenous people, resettle Syrian refugees \u2013 and do politics differently.\n\nBut four years later, the excitement surrounding the prime minister has matured into frustration and apathy. Ahead of Canada\u2019s general election on Monday, Trudeau has been robbed of the many tools he effectively deployed in his last campaign.\n\nAs the incumbent prime minister, he\u2019s no longer the underdog promising to shake up Canada for the better, nor is he even the youngest party leader. And the stunning rise of Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, threatens to steal away young voters at a time when Trudeau needs them most.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s progressive shine is looking tarnished and shop-worn, and \u2013 despite a surprise last-minute endorsement from Barack Obama \u2013 the prime minister is now in the fight of his political life.\n\nPolling shows Trudeau essentially tied with his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer. Despite spending weeks criss-crossing the country to pitch their vision of the country, neither party has successfully swayed voters.\n\nFacing the prospect of losing his parliamentary majority, the prime minister has been forced into attack mode, trading barbs with both Scheer and Singh. But the strategy \u2013 a far cry from his previous \u201csunny ways\u201d campaign \u2013 could alienate the young voters, warned Shachi Kurl, executive director at the polling firm Angus Reid.\n\nIf Trudeau hopes to emerge victorious on 21 October, he desperately needs to excite millennials, such as Pedican, who came out in record numbers for the prime minister in 2015.\n\n\u201cNegative campaigns can have the effect of increasing cynicism \u2013 and can have the effect of suppressing voter turnout,\u201d said Kurl, who argued that Trudeau\u2019s previous optimism had clouded over in an election defined by personal attacks and an absence of any bold policy discussions.\n\n\u201cMost devastatingly, [Trudeau] has failed to live up to his own standards around ethics and around doing politics differently,\u201d said Kurl \u2013 a reference to both the recent blackface scandal and a damning ethics commissioner report which found Trudeau had broken the law when he tried to prevent a large engineering company from facing criminal prosecution.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, greets supporters at a campaign rally.

The first person of color to lead a federal party, Singh\u2019s early candidacy was marred by a series of stumbles, including the exodus of several senior lawmakers from the party.\n\nBut after successful debate performances, he has surged in the polls and achieved something which now seems out of reach for Trudeau: inspiring young voters with the prospect of change.\n\nAt a recent campaign visit in Toronto, Singh posed for photos as he danced his way through the crowd to an impromptu stage.\n\n\u201cTogether, we can build a brighter future. We\u2019re not stuck with choosing between bad or worse. We\u2019re not stuck having to settle for less,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cAsk your friends, ask your neighbour, ask your family to dream big. Because you deserve it.\u201d\n\nSpooky Rexdale Mans (@andraydomise) I'm not a big believer in the political utility of memeing, but if I was, I'd tell you there's not a single political leader in the western world who understands Gen Z semiotics like this guy does. https://t.co/22jVR9NiYD\n\nMeanwhile, Trudeau has been forced to swap his lofty rhetoric of 2015 for centrist pleas to voters \u2013 disheartening those who supported his first bid.\n\n\u201cA lot of us really saw him as like a different kind of politician and then ended up being very disappointed \u2013 almost lied to by \u2013 how he turned out\u201d said Rayne Fisher-Quann, a youth activist in Vancouver who, at 18, will be voting in her first federal election. \u201cHe seems very performative, especially when you look at the huge discrepancies between his words and his actions.\u201d\n\nJustin Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand Read more\n\nShe points to a string of disappointments: Trudeau\u2019s nationalisation of the controversial TransMountain pipeline to ensure its construction despite opposition from environmentalists and some First Nations groups; his decision to boot out two high-profile women from his caucus; and his failure to meaningfully improve the country\u2019s the fraught relationship with Indigenous peoples.\n\nThese unfulfilled promises, she said, made it feel as though Trudeau was \u201cputting on a show of being progressive\u201d for younger voters.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, the prime minister has relied heavily on the slogan \u201cChoose Forward\u201d, warning that a vote for anyone but his party clears a path for a Conservative government.\n\nFor voters like Pedican, the strategy has resonated. \u201cI get that change is slow and takes time,\u201d she said. \u201c[Trudeau\u2019s] not the ideal candidate. But I would prefer to see him in office than Andrew Scheer.\u201d\n\nIf, as predicted, neither the Liberals or the Conservatives win enough votes to command a majority of the House of Commons, all parties \u2013 including the Greens and the separatist Bloc Quebecois \u2013 could emerge as kingmakers in post-electoral negotiations.\n\nWhile pollsters caution that a split on the left could open a path for the Conservatives to emerge victorious, the idea of voting strategically is often anathema to a generation that rejects the status quo of politics.\n\nAnd for those unwilling to forgive the prime minister for broken campaign promises, Singh and the New Democrats \u2013 who could wield immense power in a minority government situation \u2013 are seen as an attractive alternative.\n\n\u201cRight now a lot of people \u2013 especially young people \u2013 don\u2019t have a whole lot of hope,\u201d said Fisher-Quann. \u201cIt\u2019s always very heartening to see when a candidate is able to tap into hope \u2013 and make people feel like their voices can matter.\u201d", "description": "Four years on, frustration and apathy could alienate young people in a campaign marked by sniping, absence of bold policy and the blackface scandal", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1bbd2eb0c5eafb8c340d31dc27617d1a6f9b049/0_121_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95c43623ca35ed2a5103622d48104900", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
