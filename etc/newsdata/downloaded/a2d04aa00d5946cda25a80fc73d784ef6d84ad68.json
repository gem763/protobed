Health officials are investigating 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung illnesses in the U.S. related to e-cigarettes. Eight people have died. Many teenagers use e-cigarettes: 27.5% of high school students used them in the last 30 days, according to preliminary data from the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey released earlier this month. That is up from 20.8% in 2018.\n\nVaping\u2019s new dangers and ubiquity at high schools\u2014and even middle schools\u2014is causing understandable parental concern. But parents need to be strategic when talking to their children about e-cigarettes, psychologists and pediatricians say. Here are some tips:\n\nDon\u2019t Be Direct\n\nA parent\u2019s first instinct may be to blurt out: \u201cAre you vaping?\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019d better not be vaping.\u201d Starting the conversation that way, however, is not likely to be successful or yield the information you\u2019re after.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that they are going to deny it\u201d if they are using e-cigarettes, says Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University and founder and executive director of its Tobacco Prevention Toolkit. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t want to disappoint their parents and they are afraid of getting into trouble.\u201d\n\nInstead, Dr. Halpern-Felsher suggests that parents begin with what\u2019s in the news and use it to launch a back and forth with their child. \u201cNow is a really good time for parents to say, \u2018I\u2019ve been hearing about all the deaths and illnesses related to e-cigarettes. I\u2019m really concerned. Have you heard about this? What do you know?,\u2019 \u201d she says. And make sure you\u2019re not doing all the talking.\n\nTeens may be more likely to open up if parents ask what\u2019s going on in school and among their friends. \u201cThey are more likely to talk about them versus themselves,\u201d says Sarper Taskiran, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Child Mind Institute in New York. When parents take a more curious, nonjudgmental stance, kids will be more willing to talk\u2014and even reveal if they have tried e-cigarettes, he says.\n\nMeredith Berkman, Dorian Fuhrman and Dina Alessi founded the group Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes because they were concerned about the marketing of flavored e-cigarettes to children, including their own teenage sons.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a good resource. That way they can calmly give children accurate information\u2014and clear up any misinformation teens have picked up.\n\nOne message that particularly resonates with kids is how they are being targeted by e-cigarette companies, with candy-like flavors and promotion by cool-looking influencers, says Dr. Taskiran from the Child Mind Institute. \u201cTeens are at an age that they want control and they want to be autonomous. Pointing out that [those who vape] are being controlled by a multibillion-dollar company is something that is very upsetting to them,\u201d he says.\n\nBe Persistent\n\nThis isn\u2019t a one-time conversation. Keep the lines of communication open, says Dr. Halpern-Felsher. She also recommends that parents encourage children to talk to another adult\u2014a favorite aunt, a teacher, an older sibling\u2014if they feel like they can\u2019t share concerns with parents. \u201cYou are giving them permission to reach out,\u201d she says. And with more middle schoolers trying e-cigarettes, Dr. Avery says to start the conversation with your kids early, by age 9.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How can parents persuade their children not to use e-cigarettes? Join the conversation below.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the risk-takers who are using e-cigarettes. \u201cThere\u2019s no parent in America who can say with certainty that their kid is not using these devices,\u201d says Meredith Berkman, a founder of the advocacy and education group Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes.\n\nStay Calm\n\nWhat do you do if you find out your child is vaping? If this is a first offense, stay calm and resist the urge to punish, says Mary Alvord, a psychologist in Rockville, Md., and the author of \u201cConquer Negative Thinking for Teens.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay, \u2018I\u2019m so glad that you trust me enough to tell me this\u2019 instead of being judgmental and critical. Because we know if that\u2019s how you respond, are they going to come back to you and share anything? Not likely,\u201d she says. Punishment pushes kids to \u201cget sneakier.\u201d\n\nThen ask questions to try to find out why teens might be vaping. Is it because their friends are doing it and they want to fit in? Are they anxious or depressed and using e-cigarettes to try to ease those feelings? Knowing their motivation can help parents and teens think of other, healthier ways to address those needs, Dr. Alvord says.\n\nIt is best for parents and teens to work together to come up with an appropriate consequence\u2014losing car privileges, for example\u2014if the teen vapes again, says Karen Wilson, division chief of pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Tobacco Consortium. \u201cMake them help decide,\u201d the consequences for using. \u201cThey will have some more self-efficacy.\u201d\n\nDoctors recommend that parents educate themselves on vaping terminology and health risks so they can give teens accurate information.

Teens may be addicted to nicotine. While the FDA has not approved nicotine patches or gums for children under age 18, some doctors are using them with kids who have developed a physical dependence.\n\nTalk therapy, like motivational interviewing or cognitive behavioral therapy, can address addiction, anxiety and depression.\n\nDr. Avery at Weill Cornell says more clinicians and families are using regular urine screens (which you do at a lab or buy over the counter) to test for nicotine. He says that parents can sell the idea as a replacement for more intrusive monitoring, like searching a teen\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cIt takes the conflict out of the home,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go through their backpack, you have the data.\u201d The testing also gives kids an easy out when their friends are vaping. \u201cWhen parents are on your case, everyone understands that,\u201d he says.\n\nTalking to Your Kids\n\nDon\u2019t be confrontational. Asking your kid directly whether they are vaping can trigger denial and make them clam up.\n\nAsk about their friends. Teens may be more willing to talk about friends\u2019 habits, which might open the door to talk about their own.\n\nDon\u2019t exaggerate. The dangers are real, but exaggerating them can make kids tune out.\n\nKeep talking. Be persistent\u2014this isn\u2019t a one-time conversation.\n\nStay calm. If it\u2019s a first-time offense, resist the urge to punish. Build trust instead.\n\nStart early. With more middle schoolers trying e-cigarettes, experts recommend broaching the subject by age 9.\n\nWrite to Andrea Petersen at andrea.petersen@wsj.com", "description": "As vaping-related illnesses and deaths mount, it\u2019s even more important for parents to talk with their kids.
