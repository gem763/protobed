During the meeting, diplomats had a \u201cpessimistic assessment, but we have not reached a breaking point,\u201d a second diplomat said.\n\nThe diplomats said that Barnier is now tasked with exploring the possibilities of bridging the gap between the EU red lines and the British proposals. Talks will become more formal and intensive only if he considers that is possible. \u201cOnly then we can get back into the tunnel,\u201d said the second diplomat.\n\n\u201cThe current new red lines of the U.K. are seriously complicating matters, both the Stormont lock and customs proposals are a no-go in its current shape,\u201d said the first diplomat, referring firstly to the British proposal requirement that the Northern Ireland Assembly, commonly referred to as Stormont, approves the special arrangements to remain aligned with the EU before the end of the transition period and every four years after that. The second reference was to the British proposal on customs still requiring border checks, although not close to the border.\n\nEven if Barnier's assessment of Britain's intentions is positive, a big problem remains in terms of timing, since EU leaders will meet in two weeks and a new Political Declaration would need to be ready in time for a meeting of EU ministers a few days before.\n\n\u201cWe're open and ready to listen, they have to be ready for changes,\u201d said a third diplomat. \u201cAt the end of next week, we'll have to make assessment again to see if it's possible to have a deal in time for the [European] Council or not.\u201d EU leaders meet in Brussels on October 17-18.", "description": "EU27 ready to listen to Boris Johnson, but wary that\u2019s preparing for a blame game.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "James Randerson", "Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173266923-1200x628.jpg"}
