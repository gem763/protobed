For Kilian Jornet, three people within 10 minutes of him probably constitutes a bottleneck.\n\nBut for us mere mortals, nose-to-tail crowds on trail races are just part of the experience.\n\nIt can be frustrating as you are left with no option but to move at the crowd\u2019s pace. It can be liberating as you get a chance to chat to those around you, tapping into trail running\u2019s famous community spirit.\n\nHere are a few things you can do to make sure you are a conscientious runner, so you have the best time possible and do not ruin someone else\u2019s day.\n\nBe mindful of your poles\n\nPoles are a great tool for runners. But be aware, in the mid-pack crowd you could poke someone else. Particularly on a steep hill, the head of the person behind you is at the same level as the bottom of your poles. If you are not using your poles, do not just carry them. Fold them up and put them away. If you are using them, be extra careful not to swing and plant them like you are claiming a new-found island \u2013 there are others around who you may end up claiming instead.\n\nBe aware of runners coming up behind you\n\nOn narrow paths, it is hard to overtake people. Try to remain aware of who is coming up behind you, so you can step to the side and make more room if someone is storming past. You never know, you may unwittingly be causing a bottleneck. Absolutely do not try and block someone\u2019s way \u2013 the battle for 189th place is not a thing.\n\nBe patient\n\nConversely, if you are behind a runner who is going slowly, be patient. They might be struggling and fail to notice you desperately trying to get past. A polite \u201cexcuse me\u201d should suffice, but it is dangerous and rude to bustle past people. We all have our own goals on the trail, but aggressive overtaking is unnecessary in the mid-pack.\n\nBe careful about when you plug into your music\n\nTrail tunes are a great way to give you a boost. But when you are on a particularly busy part of the trail, with lots of other mid-pack runners jostling for time, consider taking one of the headphones out. Others might be right behind you politely asking \u201cexcuse me\u201d, and as you blast ABBA on repeat, you are unable to respond and let them past causing a bottleneck. When you have a bit more space, by all means, get those headphones in and be the dancing queen you know you can be.\n\nNever play your tunes on a loudspeaker\n\nThere is a special place in hell for trail runners who play music on a loudspeaker. In Dante\u2019s seventh circle, you are blindfolded, put on a treadmill and forced to listen to other peoples\u2019 worst favourite songs forever.\n\nIt can be particularly frustrating for a mid-pack runner because the whole group moves at the same speed, so you may be stuck with one of the outdoor boom boxes for hours unable to break away from the culprit. There is no reason to force your music on everyone around you. It\u2019s just selfish. If you are so desperate to feel like you\u2019re in a YouTube video, make a YouTube video.", "description": "Mid-pack runners face unique challenges as they battle down narrow paths surrounded by fellow racers", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/08/3fb5b246-e8ca-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_152322.JPG?itok=E7mc6iNA&v=1570519411", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
