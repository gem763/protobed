During an appearance on Dallas\u2013Fort Worth radio station Hot 93.3 on Friday to promote The Fanatic (more on that in a minute), Travolta told host Bret Mega that he \u201ckinda loved\u201d his mix-up at the VMAs, in which he appeared to mistake Jade Jolie in Taylor Swift drag for Swift herself onstage.\n\n\u201cI thought it was so funny, the way it was interpreted. And it was cool, I didn\u2019t care. You know if I wear a polka-dot tie, if I shave my head, it\u2019s headlines. If I mispronounce something, it\u2019s headlines. I know that about me. My whole life, for whatever reason, it\u2019s the Liz Taylor club, you know? You wear a different dress, you wear a different hairstyle, you\u2019re headline news. So I don\u2019t mind that. As a matter of fact, I sometimes fantasize, what if I had given it to her? Wouldn\u2019t that have been awesome?\u201d\n\nConsidering Swift\u2019s history with VMA award interceptions, maybe handing it off to Jade Jolie to save face wouldn\u2019t have been the most awesome. Also, you can\u2019t help but be charmed by Travolta comparing himself to Elizabeth Taylor over a hypothetical situation where he scandalizes Hollywood by wearing a polka-dot tie.\n\nHopefully, Travolta can apply his good-natured attitude to another setback: his new Fred Durst-directed thriller The Fanatic bombed when it premiered on Friday, earning roughly $60 per screen, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNormally, it gives us no pleasure to report this level of bomb, but Travolta helped put things into perspective in that Hot 93.3 interview about the VMAs, saying, \u201cLook. We\u2019re in pretty good shape on the day, any given day, that that kind of thing can make headlines.\u201d He added: \u201cI shaved my head, it went viral. It was a good day [\u2026] we\u2019re so used to this inundation of bad news, the idea that something so light, so insignificant as those items would do that, means at least for today, there\u2019s no bad news.\u201d Maybe, just maybe, by generating headlines with his blunders, John Travolta is doing the lord\u2019s Xenu\u2019s work. Can Travolta\u2019s awards-show blunders and shaved head save us from the news cycle? They might be the best chance we\u2019ve got. As Jade Jolie herself once sang: \u201cGirl, that\u2019s okay. Just keep shavin\u2019.\u201d", "description": "In an interview on Friday, actor John Travolta addressed his VMA flub where he almost presented the award to a drag impersonator instead of Taylor Swift. He doesn\u2019t mind these viral moments. Good thing too, because his film The Fanatic just bombed.", "authors": ["Rebecca Alter"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/02/2-john-2-travolta.w1200.h630.jpg"}
