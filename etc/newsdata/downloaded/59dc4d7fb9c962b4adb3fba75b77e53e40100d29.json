Turmoil Is Coming to the Oil Markets.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nA major Saudi Arabian oil field was attacked on Saturday, and it\u2019s safe to say that no one saw this coming. Oil futures aren\u2019t trading just yet, but the Saudi Arabian stock market is open for trading on Sundays and the Tadawul All Share Index is down more than 1%. Expect a big jump in oil prices. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, settled Friday at $54.82 a barrel.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know. On Saturday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq facility and the Khurais oil field were attacked. The oil field produces about 1.5 million barrels of crude a day, while the facility processes more than 7 million barrels, according to RBC\u2019s Helima Croft. She estimates that some 5 million barrels of oil exports won\u2019t be happening in the near term, though Saudi officials say that exports will resume in a few days.\n\nThe bigger problem is what this means for the region. Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack\u2014they supposedly used drones\u2014and if true, \u201cthe attacks marked the most effective and far-reaching drone strikes carried out by outgunned Houthi forces in neighboring Yemen,\u201d as The Wall Street Journal described it. The U.S. has already said that there is no evidence of the attacks emanating from Yemen, and raised the possibility of the attack having come from Iran or Iraq. Iran denied involvement.\n\nEither way it\u2019s a big deal. \u201cSaturday\u2019s twin drone attacks mark the most dramatic escalation in the ongoing Iran standoff and have put the region more squarely on the path to a military conflict,\u201d Croft writes.\n\nExpect a big spike in oil prices when trading begins. Oil prices have been stuck in a range recently, with WTI Crude, the U.S. benchmark, trading between $50 and $60. There\u2019s a good chance that the trading range will be broken given the sheer scale of the attack. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major U.S. market indexes, which sit near all-time highs, respond.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been preparing for a second crack at an initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, and it\u2019s safe to say that the attacks could lower the valuation it might be able to get, if the IPO isn\u2019t derailed completely.\n\nWrite to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com", "description": "A major Saudi Arabian oil field was attacked on Saturday, and it\u2019s safe to say that no one saw this coming.
