Conduct such as his has no place in our society.\"\n\nThe review found donations by Epstein from 1998 to 2007, predating his conviction as a sex offender in Florida in 2008. \"To date, we have uncovered no gifts received from Epstein or his foundation following his guilty plea,\" Bacow wrote.\n\n\"The largest of these was a $6.5 million gift in 2003 to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics,\" he wrote. \"The University received other gifts, which totaled approximately $2.4 million, based on current information.\"\n\nRead more: Jeffrey Epstein had a 'Frankenstein'-like plan to analyze human DNA in the US Virgin Islands\n\nBacow said in the letter that most of the funds had already been used as they weren't endowed funds, but he added that there was \"one current use fund and one small endowment designated to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with a total unspent balance of $186,000.\"\n\nThe university plans to redirect the unspent funds toward organizations that help victims of sexual assault and human trafficking, he said.\n\nEpstein died from suicide in a federal jail cell while awaiting trial on one count of sex trafficking and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, related to an investigation into allegations that he abused dozens of girls, some as young as 14. Epstein pleaded not guilty to the charges. Facing similar allegations in 2008, he pleaded guilty to two state counts of soliciting prostitution and spent 13 months in a Florida county jail where he was granted work release for six days a week.\n\n\"This is an unusual step for the University, but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein's egregiously repugnant crimes,\" Bacow wrote.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology faced scrutiny recently for accepting donations from the disgraced financier. The MIT Media Lab was in contact with Epstein following his 2008 guilty plea and tried to conceal its connections, according to a report from The New Yorker. Joi Ito, who served as the director of the MIT Media Lab, resigned last week after the report.\n\nNOW WATCH: Nxivm leader Keith Raniere has been convicted.
