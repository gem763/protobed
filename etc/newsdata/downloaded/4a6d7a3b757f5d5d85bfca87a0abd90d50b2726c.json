As training camps get underway Trysta Krick digests, debriefs and explains all the crazy moves made with a map. Take notes and get ready. USA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Any time Anthony Davis touched the ball, he seemingly could do whatever he wanted.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers star grabbed rebounds over his opponents. He dunked on them almost any time he could. Even when defenders forced him to take a jump shot, Davis often made those, too.\n\nIt does not take someone of Davis\u2019 skill to understand why the Lakers became so relentless last season and during the summer to acquire the six-time NBA All-Star. In his first game wearing a Lakers uniform, he fully explained why. In the Lakers\u2019 123-101 preseason win over the Golden State Warriors in the first game ever at Chase Center, Davis finished with 22 points while shooting 9-of-16 from the field and grabbing 10 rebounds.\n\n\"He\u2019s a monster,\" Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of Davis. \"It\u2019s going to be very difficult to slow him down with what we have around him. I\u2019m excited about what he\u2019s going to do. Lakers fans should be, too.\"\n\nIt often looked like the Lakers simply handed the ball to Davis and got out of his way. Davis flourished for much deeper reasons. Beyond his talent, Davis has taken various steps to accelerate his adjustment with the Lakers. That started with cementing chemistry immediately with star LeBron James.\n\nMORE NBA\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever easy to build. But I think it\u2019s been very good because of the relationship we had before and we\u2019re good teammates,\" James said. \"We\u2019re able to be straightforward with one another, not sugarcoat anything and not take anything personal. We\u2019re being able to take the criticism. He gets in my ear. I get in his ear. It\u2019s all about trying to make each other better and accountable for each other. That is ultimately better for our team.\"\n\nThis mindset began well before Davis stepped on the floor against the Warriors. Shortly after the Lakers acquired Davis from New Orleans for Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart and the No. 4 pick before the draft, Davis and James spoke constantly about X\u2019s and O\u2019s. Once the Lakers finalized their roster, Davis and his teammates often communicated via group texts and phone calls. Davis spearheaded a mini-camp in Las Vegas a week before training camp started. Vogel then often paired James and Davis together in scrimmages.\n\nSo once the game started, Davis spoke to his teammates both on the bench and on the court about various adjustments all parties could make. Davis relied on the Lakers\u2019 various point-guard options to call plays, including James, Rajon Rondo, Alex Caruso and Avery Bradley. In related news, Davis finished with 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting and seven rebounds in the first quarter. That marked only three points shy of the Warriors, who struggled with 20 first-quarter points on a 9-of-27 clip.\n\nCLOSE Just before the season, NBA Rookies predict their stats and give their pick for Rookie of the Year. USA TODAY\n\n\"The more we can do that, the easier the game will be for us and our teammates,\" Davis said. \"Any time we have an opportunity to learn, it\u2019s always good for us.\"\n\nDavis learned fairly quickly. He finished with five first-quarter dunks that all had their own story. Davis stole a rebound from Warriors forward Alfonzo McKinnie and converted on a putback. Rondo threw two lobs to Davis. James one-timed a bounce pass to Davis for an open dunk. Davis made another putback off a Dwight Howard miss.\n\n\"They\u2019re great players. They make things look easy,\" Lakers guard Danny Green said of Davis and James. \"It\u2019s a natural instinct to them and natural bond between them. Really good things open up for all parties. So it\u2019s easier for them to connect because of how good they are.\"\n\nThe necessary caveats: The Warriors are adjusting amid Kevin Durant\u2019s departure, Klay Thompson\u2019s knee injury and Andre Iguodala\u2019s absence. The Warriors are currently decimated at center with Willie Cauley-Stein sidelined through training camp (left foot) and Kevon Looney out day-to-day (right hamstring). Davis (18 minutes) simply played in a preseason game where both he and James (17) sat in the entire second half.\n\nJames did not view the Lakers\u2019 preseason opener in those terms. He missed 27 games last season because of a strained left groin. He originally suffered the injury in a Christmas Day matchup against the Warriors. Lastly, he wanted to cement a foundation by both making Davis feel comfortable and building productive habits.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t even think about being a preseason game,\" James said. \"I thought about it being a game and how we can get better. I didn\u2019t want to take it lightly because it was a preseason game.\"\n\nNeither did Davis, though he maintained he did not feel nervous despite wearing his Lakers uniform in an actual game. He also downplayed having any extra nerves after being sidelined since March 21 with New Orleans because of various left finger and back injuries.\n\n\"I was ready to get back on the floor again,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis will get on the floor again soon. The Lakers will depart Monday for a week-long trip to China with exhibitions against the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai (Thursday) and Shenzhen (Saturday). Then, Vogel sounded open-ended on either keeping the same workload for James and Davis, or slightly increasing it. Either way, Davis appears ready. His talent aside, Davis made all the necessary steps to minimize the major adjustments that could await him on a new team.\n\n\"I got that out the way the first day of training camp,\" Davis said. \"It\u2019s about time we played against someone else other than ourselves.\"\n\nFollow Mark Medina on Twitter, on Facebook and on Instagram.", "description": "Davis had 22 points and 10 rebounds in 18 minutes, while showing instant chemistry with his new Lakers teammates in a 123-101 win over the Warriors.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published A.M.
