But there is no water flowing through the channel of one of the world\u2019s mightiest waterways. The pair run down the river bank and cheerfully splash through stagnant puddles dotted about the riverbed.\n\n\u201cWe wish we had a river, so we could swim, and jump and sail my cousin\u2019s boat,\u201d said Daniel, 12. \u201cAt least we have puddles to make mud balls, that can be fun.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dilan Rodr\u00edguez, 8, fishing in the canal that runs adjacent to the dry Colorado River at the border of Mexico and the US on 6 September 2019. Photograph: Meghan Dhaliwal/The Guardian\n\nThe Colorado originates in the Rocky mountains and traverses seven US states, watering cities and farmland, before reaching Mexico, where it is supposed to flow onwards to the Sea of Cortez.\n\nInstead, the river is dammed at the US-Mexico border, and on the other side the river channel is empty. Locals are now battling to bring it back to life.\n\nThere are few more striking examples of what has come to be known as \u201cenvironmental injustice\u201d \u2013 the inequitable access to clean land, air and water, and disproportionate exposure to hazards and climate disasters. Water in particular has emerged as a flash point as global heating renders vast swaths of the planet ever drier.\n\nToday the Guardian is launching a year-long series, Our Unequal Earth, to investigate environmental inequalities and discrimination in the US and beyond. It will also reveal how the climate crisis is making things worse for activists and scientists on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard stories from my mum about how she used to play and swim in the Colorado River when she was little, but we\u2019ve never experienced it,\u201d said Evelin Bautista, 14, who is a member of an indigenous tribe, the Cucap\u00e1, which means the River People. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that over the border, the water is so clear that they can even see the fish.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a mere 30 miles north, over the border at Gateway park in Yuma, Arizona, siblings Damien Navarro, 12, and Dariana, eight, spent the day fishing, diving and swimming in the free flowing river.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hot, we come here all the time, the kids love the water, and we often catch catfish, bass and bluegill,\u201d said their father, David Barraga. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there\u2019s no river in Mexico. Wow, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt school in science we\u2019ve been learning about drought, that the planet is getting hotter,\u201d said his son, Damien. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never been told about the dam or the river in Mexico, maybe when we\u2019re older. It\u2019s really too bad for those kids.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Barraga plays ball with his daughter Dariana and his step-son Damien in the Colorado River in Gateway Park, Yuma, Arizona on 7 September 2019.

The loss of the river in Mexico has has been devastating.\n\nNancy Saldano, 54, an architect and activist in the Sonoran town of San Luis Rio Colorado, recalls boat rides and fishing with her family during the 1980s, when the US occasionally released \u201cextra\u201d water to deal with heavy snow and rain that risked overwhelming its dams. Her mother, an evangelical pastor, conducted baptisms in the river until it disappeared.\n\n\u201cTaking away the river had a huge impact on us, it took away part of our identity. I felt anger, sadness, and grief. My children had never seen the river flow.\u201d\n\nThe disparities on both sides of the border are stark.\n\nIn the US, the Colorado serves over 35 million people, including several native tribes, seven national wildlife refuges, 11 national parks, and, supports $26m tourism and recreational industries, as well as farming. California has rights to the largest quantity with 4.4m acre-feet per year \u2013 or 29% of the total \u2013 while Utah is allocated 1.7m and Nevada 0.3m.\n\nAt the Morelos dam, located between Los Algodones, Baja California and Yuma, Arizona, the river is diverted to a complex system of irrigation canals which nourish fields of cotton, wheat, alfalfa, asparagus, watermelons and date palms in the vast surrounding desert valley. This is good for farmers \u2013 and less so for ordinary Mexicans.\n\nFollowing the dry riverbed south towards the Gulf of California evokes an eerie sadness. The sound of gunfire in one wide, dusty section led to a couple from San Diego hunting wild pigeons, and a bucketful of feathered corpses. A few miles west along dirt farm roads, dozens of herons, egrets and ducks were staking out a wonderfully lush wetland \u2013 though it is only an accidental byproduct created by agricultural runoff from surrounding wheat and alfalfa fields.\n\nProlonged drought and global heating\n\nThe Colorado basin is one of 276 watersheds that cross international borders and Mexican supporters of the binational treaty argue that it resolved long-standing diplomatic disputes and enabled the region\u2019s economic development, even if there is mostly no longer a river in the channel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only place in Mexico with a secure water supply, that is a privilege,\u201d said Francisco Bernal, the International Boundary and Water Commission (Cila) representative in Mexicali.\n\nBut the treaty didn\u2019t foresee prolonged drought, global heating, and, mounting demands. Now, water is running out, and things must change.\n\nThe population of Baja California grew from 1.67 million in 1990 to 3.5 million in 2018. Most of the river water still goes to farmers. Groundwater reserves are dwindling, pollution goes unchecked, and urban neighborhoods face shortages.\n\n\u201cIf agriculture was forced to be more efficient there would be enough for everyone else,\u201d said Dr Jorge Ram\u00edrez, a leading water scientist at the Autonomous University of Baja California. \u201cWe have enough water, what we lack is planning. Water is the currency here and politics always wins.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, protests have erupted in response to allegations of corruption and poorly policed pollution standards that favor big landowners and water guzzling industries, such as a controversial US brewery under construction in the Mexicali valley.\n\nIn 2020, both countries will for the first time implement rationing. Mexico must cut usage by 3%. The US must save 247m cubic metres. The plan would have been much stricter if not for record snowfall in parts of the Colorado basin last year. The reductions can only be accomplished if farmers waste less and participate in reforestation efforts.\n\nEven so, scientists are optimistic that the delta can partially recover.\n\n\u2018The Gabachos [Americans] should leave some water for us\u2019\n\nIn the scorched and barren delta, visitors may encounter an incongruous sight: 700 acres of flourishing native trees and shrubs in three reforestation sites.\n\nThey are the product of what is called a \u201cpulse flow\u201d.\n\nIn 2014, an environmental experiment driven by not-for-profits on both sides of the border resulted in 105,392 acres-feet of extra water being released into Mexico over two months, simulating the natural spring floods of yesteryear.\n\nThe pulse flow bolstered parched wetlands and reforestation zones where native cottonwood and willow trees naturally germinated. And for a few days, for the first time in years, the river reconnected to the Sea of Cortez: fish stocks increased, dolphins returned, and the number of migratory birds rocketed by 43%.\n\nBut for some scientists, the community response was perhaps the most surprising and satisfying. Thousands flocked to the river as it returned, briefly, to its former glory.\n\n\u201cI grew up with my mum\u2019s stories about the river in the old days, but couldn\u2019t believe it until I saw it myself,\u201d said Ulises Monroy Salda\u00f1a, 13. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget putting my hand in the water for the first time: it was cold, but it felt so nice because it was so hot here.\u201d\n\nDaniel Rodr\u00edguez was just seven years old, but still remembers the excitement of watching the river fill with water. \u201cWe\u2019d come every day after school and keep jumping off the bridge until the police chased us away.\u201d\n\nHis grandmother, Lupe Aderete, 53, set up portable toilets for the massive influx of visitors. \u201cIt was beautiful to see the river alive again, everyone was so happy, and I made some extra money.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, the Gabachos [Americans] should leave some water for us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lupe Aderete at home in the neighborhood of Miguel Aleman, Baja California on 6 September 2019. Photograph: Meghan Dhaliwal/The Guardian\n\nThe restoration site at Laguna Grande is a shady oasis of gangly cottonwood and willow trees surrounded by desert and farmland, visited by over 2,000 people last year.\n\n\u201cFor most children, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen a forest, and for the adults it brings back memories. Connecting to nature is emotional, and visitors cry all the time,\u201d said Gabriela Gonz\u00e1lez, education coordinator at the Sonora Institute which runs Laguna Grande.\n\nThere\u2019s little or no chance that the river will ever flow freely again, but plans are afoot to repeat the pulse flow, this time flooding only the spots which most benefited last time. And there is hope of expanding native forests to create a green corridor with wetlands and lagoons channelling into the sea.\n\nAn indigenous community, the Cucap\u00e1, has been involved in dredging efforts, paid to shovel out thick mud to create connectivity channels that are crucial to sustainable ecosystems. Patches of native salty grass and flocks of raucous brown and white pelicans at the lower part of the estuary indicate that plentiful fish were swept in by recent high tides.\n\nThe next pulse flow should take place in 2021 or 2022. Regardless, this region will remain more desert than delta.\n\nAt home in Miguel Alem\u00e1n, a poor makeshift neighbourhood with little shade, the Rodr\u00edguez brothers ditch their school stuff, grab a plastic bucket and rush back across the parched terrain to the concrete drainage canal running parallel to the littered riverbed.\n\nThey fearlessly dive into the polluted waterway, which emerges under the metal border wall, to cool down and catch some fish for dinner.\n\nTo contact Nina Lakhani, the Guardian\u2019s new environmental justice reporter, e-mail nina.lakhani@theguardian.com", "description": "The Colorado River serves over 35 million Americans before reaching Mexico \u2013 but it is dammed at the border, leaving locals on the other side with a dry delta", "authors": ["Nina Lakhani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e934d4e178468212c831c7fcee05764b5daf1878/238_328_2475_1486/master/2475.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5b28c0eb6944b337c1eb30aa6997c654", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
