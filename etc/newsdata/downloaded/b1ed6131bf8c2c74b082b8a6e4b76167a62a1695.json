More than 200 million people visited the museum and Zhongjie last year, according to Shenyang's cultural and tourism bureau.\n\nDue to its abundant resources, Zhongjie was listed as one of 11 national projects that aim to renovate and upgrade pedestrian streets by the Ministry of Commerce earlier this year.\n\nShenyang's night-economy activities top nine major cities in China, according to a recent central government report on consumption patterns of residents in China.\n\nJiang Wei, a professor of finance at Shenyang University, said the night economy is vital for commerce. The local government should strengthen its guidance to make the night economy a new growth point, Jiang said.\n\nWang said: \"The night economy can help to stimulate the local economy with an increase in consumption. We are making every effort to make use of the chance.\"\n\nHe added that the local government is upgrading the Shenyang Imperial Palace Museum into a national 5A scenic spot and building the Zhongjie area into a high-quality commercial and shopping location with support from the central government.\n\nYang Zhongtian, the founder of Zhongjie Bingdian, an ice-cream producer in Shenhe district, said his business had benefited from the local authorities' efforts to develop the night economy.\n\n\"Thanks to the night economy, our revenue has increased dramatically in the past months as more young people come here to relax after work,\" he said.", "description": "Zhongjie, a commercial area in the center of Shenyang, Liaoning province, is trying to build a night economy as a new engine of growth by combining its geographic and cultural advantages.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d3ec4a310cf3e97a03a47.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
