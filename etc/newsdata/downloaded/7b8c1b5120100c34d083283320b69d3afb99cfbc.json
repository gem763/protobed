And what a time to be here..always remember,\" Cavallari wrote in the post, posted the morning of the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the nation including NYC.\n\nLess than 40 minutes after she uploaded the photograph, the post had garnered hundreds of negative responses. It also had more than 57,000 likes, including one from Victoria's Secret supermodel Lily Aldridge.\n\n\"Poor taste,\" one Instagram user responded on Wednesday.\n\n\"Wrong picture for the sentiment in the post,\" another one of her followers wrote.\n\n\"Big fan of both you and your product, even visited your store when I was in Nashville this past year. But wrong photo with your message,\" another followers posted. \"A low cut black dress with a smile shouldn\u2019t be your look for today. Maybe throw on jeans and a t shirt and go visit one of those fire stations. Pay your respects..\"\n\nAnother post reads, \"You\u2019re gorgeous, but maybe this picture is not the right one for today. All those people that lost their loved ones don\u2019t care how hot you look, today.\"\n\nCavallari (\"The Hills\") soon changed the caption to simply, \"NYC for 24hrs.\"\n\nCavallari owns jewelry business Uncommon James in Nashville, and lives in the city with her former-NFL quarterback husband, Jay Cutler.\n\nBells tolled across New York City and moments of silence were being observed across the nation Wednesday as America remembered the Sept. 11 terror attacks.\n\nA moment of silence was observed at 8:46 a.m. EDT to mark the time the first plane hit \u2013 American Airlines Flight 11, flying from Boston to Los Angeles, had been hijacked before slamming into the north face of the North Tower.\n\nIn New York, the names of the almost 3,000 victims were being solemnly read at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. Intermittent moments of silence marked the impact times for the second Ground Zero plane, the moments when each tower collapsed, and the impact times for the planes that struck the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\n\nReach Natalie Neysa Alund at nalund@tennessean.com and follow her on Twitter @nataliealund.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Kristin Cavallari Instagram post on Sept. 11 anniversary criticized", "description": "\"A low cut black dress with a smile shouldn\u2019t be your look for today,\" an Instagram user commented on Kristin Cavallari's Sept. 11 post.", "authors": ["Natalie Neysa Alund", "Nashville Tennessean"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XrjjObDmAqB_LQxvb7x6pQ--~B/aD00MzM5O3c9NTc4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/3c3d0e8eb1ea84f7c33e3635314d5c44", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
