Little did she know, she was breaking the law.\n\nEarlier that year, Griffin, 42, came off probation for delivering less than a hundred grams of cocaine. When she was convicted in 2008, she lost her right to vote.\n\nFelonies in Iowa are \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d that immediately result in voting restrictions because they involve offenses of \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d Currently 56,500 felons are unable to vote in Iowa; only 7,400 of those are still in prison.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a low-level felon, my crime was not against a person,\u201d Griffin told Watchdog.\n\nGriffin\u2019s lawyer informed her in 2008 that under the policy in place at that time, she would be able to vote again in 2013 upon completion of her probation.\n\nAn executive order issued on July 4, 2005, by Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack restored voting rights to disenfranchised felons who had completed their sentences and been discharged from parole. Over the next six years, 115,000 felons regained the right to vote in the Hawkeye State.\n\nVilsack\u2019s Republican successor, Terry Branstad, rescinded the order on his first day back in office in 2011. He had previously served as governor from 1983 to 1999.\n\nOn average, about 20 applications a year have been approved since Branstad reclaimed the governor\u2019s office. In 2015, 25 people applied for restoration of voting rights in the first three and a half months alone, but he only granted 17 requests the entire year. (A request for the full year\u2019s number of requests went unanswered by the governor\u2019s office.)\n\nGriffin said she did not know about the changed policy when she walked into her local voting center in Montrose, Iowa, tucked into the southeast corner of Iowa, across the Mississippi River from the onetime Mormon Zion of Nauvoo. A few weeks after the election, police arrested her for voter fraud and charged her with perjury. A jury later acquitted her of the charges, but she decided to challenge the law that a nonviolent crime could be considered \u201cinfamous,\u201d a designation that carries with it \u2014 among other things \u2014 loss of the right to vote.\n\nThe ACLU took the issue to court on behalf of Griffin in 2014.\n\nIn Griffin v. Pate, the Iowa Supreme Court decided in a 4-3 decision that under the Iowa Constitution, a non-violent felony is an infamous crime.\n\nThe loss disheartened Griffin and 20,000 other felons whose voting rights hung in the balance. Griffin said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the decision. \u201cI thought I had a good chance of winning. I appreciate the judges for hearing my case.\u201d\n\nGriffin said she voted in elections before her arrest, and growing up with a father in law enforcement gave her an appreciation of how elections can affect her family\u2019s livelihood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re parents picking out school board members,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to give up that right because of my past. I should be able to vote for people who govern my children\u2019s school.\u201d\n\nBack to the legislature\n\nIn his 44 page majority decision, Chief Justice Mark Cady explained that it is up to the legislature to amend the current law to allow non-violent felons to vote.\n\n\u201cA new definition will be up to the future evolution of our understanding of voter disqualification as a society, revealed through the voices of our democracy,\u201d Cady wrote.\n\nThe ACLU plans to push for that, according to Veronica Fowler, the communications director for the Iowa ACLU, told Watchdog.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the majority ruling seems to invite the General Assembly to amend current Iowa Code to redefine \u2018infamous crime\u2019 for purposes of disenfranchisement as something other than all felonies,\u201d state Rep. Mary Wolfe, D-Clinton, told the Des Moines Register. \u201cI certainly think the average Iowan would not agree that all felonies, every category of felonies, reaches the level of infamous crimes.\u201d\n\nWolfe argues that felonies such as repeated drunk-driving arrests and drug-possession should not be considered infamous crimes.\n\nArlene Victor, a 31 year volunteer for the Dubuque, Iowa Chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, takes exception to that, at least as far as drunk driving is concerned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious crime. It should be taken seriously,\u201d Victor told Watchdog.org. \u201cA time period should be considered [for voting]. They are [potential] murderers, and their weapon is a vehicle instead of a gun.\u201d\n\nWolfe and other legislators are making the issue a priority, and mothers like Victor and Griffin will both be watching.\n\n\u201cPeople who complete probation should have a right to vote,\u201d Griffin told Watchdog. \u201cI think that if you do all that is required of you should have your right to vote restored. Once I completed my probation they told me I was a productive member of society. Voting is being a productive member of society.\u201d", "description": "Kelli Jo Griffin took her four children to the voting .09/02/2019 3:04:56AM EST.", "authors": ["Byron Solomon", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/08/0-4yTZ3FZPngoTc5fS-1-300x207.jpg"}
