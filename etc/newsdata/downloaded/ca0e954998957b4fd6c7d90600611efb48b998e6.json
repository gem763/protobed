This school year, skip the packaged ramen and blue-boxed mac and cheese, instead turning to more wholesome, real food options that provide more nutrition, more servings (hello, leftovers!) and more flavour without breaking the budget.\n\nThis guide is for the first big shop while your parents are still in town, and offers a version for those on a school meal plan and those on their own. The ultimate, healthy student pantry is here to do the heavy lifting on your meals this year so you can spend less time at the grocery store and more time on what's important to you \u2014 all without sacrificing the flavours you love.\n\nHow to build your pantry shopping list for students on \u2014 and not on \u2014 a meal plan\n\nBelow are a list of 'basics' \u2014 ingredients that are tried, true and deemed essential, as well as ingredients under a category called 'extra credit', which are a little more out there and aren't crucial to the healthy pantry, but really fun to have. Mix and match the ingredients that you personally enjoy.\n\nStudents on a meal plan will likely only need to stick to the 'basics' category, while those who are cooking all meals on their own can glean inspiration from the 'extra credit' category (add the 'basics' plus 'extra credit' to create your list).\n\nAnd don't forget about your refrigerator and freezer. These two 'cold pantries' hold a number of long-lasting items that can make complete meals from scratch or add sparkle to bland ones, so you'll find foodstuffs you can store in those areas, too.\n\nThe ultimate healthy pantry shopping list for students\n\nSalt, pepper, herbs and spices\n\nSeasonings are the backbone of cooking, bringing out the best in everything from a bowl of oatmeal to spaghetti bolognese. These ingredients turn everyday student meals into brilliant feasts. To keep costs down and get a wider selection, shop for this section at a bulk store.\n\nBasics\n\nKosher salt\n\nWhole peppercorns (don't forget a pepper grinder)\n\nCrushed red pepper flakes\n\nDried thyme or Italian herb blend\n\nGround cinnamon\n\nExtra credit\n\nCurry powder\n\nChili powder\n\nGaram masala\n\nOils, vinegars and condiments\n\nStart off saut\u00e9s and stir-fries; pan-fry meat, poultry, fish and tofu; make a salad dressing or dip for veggies; spice up a bowl of soup; amp up your avocado toast; marinate a tough or bland cut of protein; and so much more \u2014 it's all possible with these transformers.\n\nBasics\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil (for low/medium-temperature cooking and raw use)\n\nAvocado oil (for high-temperature cooking)\n\nButter (refrigerator or freezer)\n\nBalsamic vinegar\n\nSoy sauce or gluten-free tamari\n\nDijon mustard (refrigerator)\n\nMayonnaise (refrigerator)\n\nSriracha (refrigerator)\n\nNatural peanut butter (refrigerator)\n\nJam (refrigerator)\n\nNatural ketchup (free from corn syrup or liquid sugar)\n\nExtra credit\n\nSesame oil\n\nRice vinegar\n\nApple cider vinegar\n\nNatural almond butter (refrigerator)\n\nPure maple syrup or honey (perfect for taking plain yogurt to the next level)\n\nGrains, pasta and breads\n\nFor students on a meal plan, do a halfway-to-homemade grain bowl with cafeteria items, like chopped fresh or cooked vegetables, falafel and hummus, and add them on top of homemade cooked brown rice or quinoa. Students cooking without a meal plan can take store-bought helpers, like prepared hummus, and cook their own vegetables (roast a big batch for the week!) to pair with a quick-cooking grain.\n\nBasics\n\nLarge-flake or quick-cooking steel-cut oatmeal\n\nQuick-cooking brown rice or basmati rice\n\nQuinoa\n\nWhole grain or gluten-free pasta (stock up on a few different shapes and sizes)\n\nSliced whole grain or sourdough bread (freezer)\n\nExtra credit\n\nWhole wheat couscous\n\nFrozen pizza dough (freezer)\n\nWhole wheat wraps (freezer)\n\nWhole wheat flour (hello, weekend pancakes)\n\nNuts, seeds and dried fruits\n\nSnack happy with these protein and healthy fat-filled ingredients. Top your morning oatmeal (at the cafeteria or at home) with a handful of nuts for additional staying power, or keep satiated in between meals with a handful of almonds (and maybe some dark chocolate chips thrown in). These boosters offer crunch to meal hall or homemade salads, soups and yogurt cups, all while delivering brain health benefits. It's recommended that you store nuts and seeds in the freezer or refrigerator as they can go rancid quickly.\n\nBasics\n\nRoasted or raw almonds or walnuts (freezer)\n\nSunflower seeds (freezer)\n\nExtra credit\n\nChia seeds\n\nMedjool dates (for a tasty snack or healthy dessert, stuff a pitted date with a spoonful of peanut butter or almond butter)\n\nCanned and dried beans, legumes and proteins\n\nThese storecupboard proteins are good additions to soups and stews, can be mashed with mayonnaise and lemon juice to make a wrap or sandwich filling, stewed and served on toast or tossed with pasta for a cheap and simple warm dinner or salad.\n\nBasics\n\nCanned chickpeas\n\nCanned tuna\n\nExtra credit\n\nCanned black beans\n\nDried red lentils (for a delicious, budget-friendly big batch dal)\n\nTofu (available shelf-stable or refrigerated)\n\nCanned salmon\n\nFalafel (freezer)\n\nVegetables, fruits and milks\n\nFrom pasta sauce to soup bases, stews to granola toppers, canned vegetables, fruits and milks are must-have student kitchen ingredients filled with flavour. Turn a can of tomatoes into a rich spaghetti sauce or chana masala (just add chickpeas and garam masala), make a creamy soup dairy-free with the helping hand of coconut milk or warm up with a mug of cinnamon-and-honey-spiced almond milk while studying.\n\nBasics\n\nCanned whole or diced tomatoes\n\nUnsweetened almond milk (tetra packs; refrigerate after opening)\n\nExtra credit\n\nJarred pesto (refrigerator)\n\nSun dried tomatoes (sun dried tomatoes plus pesto is a quick and satisfying pasta sauce)\n\nCanned coconut milk (add dairy-free decadence to sweet potato soup)\n\nFrozen berries (freezer)\n\nThroughout the coming weeks, stay creative with your meals, shop your pantry before your hit the store again and keep it simple. A year of healthy meals is easier than ever with this solid pantry plan.\n\nAllison Day is the cookbook author of Modern Lunch.
