We believe that's the way we can get best out of the team,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a bit horses for courses, but we also believe it's also our most fit in-form, best available and best combination team.\"\n\nErasmus insisted there were no mind games in revealing a potentially little-changed match-day 23 or in his comments on tactics.\n\n\"No, no bluffing!\" the former Munster coach said.\n\n\"It's probably exactly the same 23, with Cheslin Kolbe being one of the guys who comes into the match-day 23.\"\n\nAs for tactics, he said that the team would only train twice, for a maximum of 160 minutes.\n\n\"There's not a hell of a lot you can change in your tactics in two training sessions on a six-day turnaround. So you can expect pretty much the same from us on Saturday.\"\n\nErasmus expected England to be \"brimming with confidence\" after their 19-7 semi-final win over defending champions New Zealand.\n\nHe highlighted England's outstanding line speed in defence, which cuts down on time and space, and deprived the All Blacks any access to their free-flowing, off-loading game.\n\n\"We've played England four times in the last two years and the score is 2-2,\" he said.\n\n\"Both teams have definitely improved since then.\"", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has promised more of the same tactics in the Rugby World Cup final against England.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7721/be2c159c31674c82b301ceb87cbe67ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
