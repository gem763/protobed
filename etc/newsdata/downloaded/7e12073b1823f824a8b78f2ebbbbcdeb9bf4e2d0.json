Lebanon could end up further under the sway of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, making it even harder to attract badly-needed foreign investment.\n\nIt also defies Hezbollah, which was part of his coalition and wanted him and the government to stay on. Hariri is seen as the focal point for Western and Gulf Arab aid to Lebanon, which is in dire need of financial support promised by these allies.\n\nLebanon has been paralyzed by the unprecedented wave of protests against the rampant corruption of the political class.\n\n\u201cFor 13 days the Lebanese people have waited for a decision for a political solution that stops the deterioration (of the economy). And I have tried, during this period, to find a way out, through which to listen to the voice of the people,\u201d Hariri said.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to have a big shock to face the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cTo all partners in political life, our responsibility today is how we protect Lebanon and revive its economy.\u201d\n\nUnder Lebanon\u2019s constitution, the government will stay on in a caretaker capacity as talks begin on forming a new one. It took nine months to form the Hariri coalition cabinet that took office in January.\n\nAs night fell, protesters returned to central Beirut waving Lebanese flags, seemingly unfazed by the violence.\n\nSome described Hariri\u2019s resignation as a victory for the \u201cOct. 17 uprising\u201d and said the attack on the protest camp had redoubled their determination.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is a point of strength for us ... If the thugs come in bigger numbers, so will we,\u201d said Kamal Rida, a protester in central Beirut. \u201cThe tents that are broken can be rebuilt, easy.\u201d\n\nThe turmoil has worsened Lebanon\u2019s acute economic crisis, with financial strains leading to a scarcity of hard currency and a weakening of the pegged Lebanese pound. Lebanese government bonds tumbled on the turmoil.\n\nTENTS ON FIRE\n\nOn the streets of Beirut, black-clad men wielding sticks and pipes attacked the protest camp that has been the focal point of countrywide rallies against the elite.\n\nSayyed Hassan Nasrallah, head of the heavily armed, Iran-backed Hezbollah, said last week that roads closed by protesters should be reopened and suggested the demonstrators were financed by its foreign enemies and implementing their agenda.\n\nSmoke rose as some of the protester tents were set ablaze by Hezbollah and Amal supporters, who earlier fanned out in the downtown area of the capital shouting \u201cShia, Shia\u201d in reference to themselves and cursing anti-government demonstrators.\n\n\u201cWith our blood and lives we offer ourselves as a sacrifice for you Nabih!\u201d they chanted in reference to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, head of the Amal Movement. \u201cWe heed your call, we heed your call, Nasrallah!\u201d they chanted.\n\nSecurity forces did not initially intervene to stop the assault, in which protesters were hit with sticks and were seen appealing for help as they ran, witnesses said. Tear gas was eventually fired to disperse the crowds.\n\nHariri did not refer to the violence in his address but urged all Lebanese to \u201cprotect civil peace and prevent economic deterioration, before anything else\u201d.\n\nFrance, which has supported Hariri, called on all Lebanese to help guarantee national unity.\n\nLebanon's Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri speaks during a news conference in Beirut, Lebanon October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the formation of a new government responsive to the needs of the Lebanese people.\n\n\u201cThe Lebanese people want an efficient and effective government, economic reform, and an end to endemic corruption,\u201d Pompeo said in a statement.\n\nLEBANESE POUND UNDER PRESSURE\n\nLebanon\u2019s allies last year pledged $11 billion in financing to help it revive its economy, conditional on reforms that Hariri\u2019s coalition government has largely failed to implement.\n\nBut there has been no sign of a rush to help.\n\nA senior U.S. State Department official said last week this was not a situation where the Lebanese government should necessarily get a bailout, saying they should reform first.\n\nBanks were closed for a 10th day along with schools and businesses.\n\nHariri last week sought to defuse popular discontent through a batch of reform measures agreed with other groups in his coalition government, including Hezbollah, to - among other things - tackle corruption and long-delayed economic reforms.\n\nBut with no immediate steps towards enacting these steps, they did not placate the demonstrators.\n\nCentral bank governor Riad Salameh called on Monday for a solution to the crisis in just days to restore confidence and avoid a future economic meltdown.\n\nA black market for U.S. dollars has emerged in the last month or so. Three foreign currency dealers said a dollar cost 1,800 pounds on Tuesday, weakening from levels of 1,700 and 1,740 cited on Monday.\n\nThe official pegged rate is 1,507.5 pounds to the dollar.\n\nSlideshow (30 Images)\n\n\u201cEven if the protesters leave the streets the real problem facing them is what they are going to do with the devaluation of the pound,\u201d said Toufic Gaspard, an economist who has worked as an adviser to the IMF and to the Lebanese finance minister.\n\n\u201cA very large majority of the Lebanese income is in the Lebanese pound, their savings are in the Lebanese pound and their pension is in Lebanese, and it is certain it has already started to devalue,\u201d he said.", "description": "Saad al-Hariri resigned as Lebanon's prime minister on Tuesday, declaring he had hit a \"dead end\" in trying to resolve a crisis unleashed by huge protests against the ruling elite and plunging the country deeper into turmoil.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446203882&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S166", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
