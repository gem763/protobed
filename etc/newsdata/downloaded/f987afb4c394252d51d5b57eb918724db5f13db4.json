Qahtani was also an architect of the kingdom\u2019s online propaganda efforts and a central player in Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to rein in overseas critics like Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post.\n\nKhashoggi was killed Oct. 2, 2018, in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by a team of Saudi agents. His body, which was dismembered after he was killed, has never been recovered.\n\n\u201cOver the past 18 months, MBS\u2019s communications team within the Royal court publicly has chastised, and worse, intimidated anyone who disagrees,\u201d Khashoggi wrote in a column in The Post in February 2018, referring to the crown prince by his initials. \u201cSaud al-Qahtani, leader of that unit, has a blacklist and calls for Saudis to add names to it.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Twitter profile photo of Saud al-Qahtani, a former strategist for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nA few weeks after Khashoggi\u2019s death, the Saudi government said Qahtani and several other senior officials had been fired from their posts. Saudi prosecutors said in November 2018 that they were investigating Qahtani\u2019s role in Khashoggi\u2019s killing and that he had been forbidden to leave the kingdom. At the same time, the Trump administration said it was imposing sanctions on Qahtani for his part in the \u201cplanning and execution of the operation that led to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nQahtani has also been accused of overseeing the abuse and torture of jailed Saudi women\u2019s rights activists.\n\nOver the last year, the Saudi government has refused to clarify Qahtani\u2019s legal status, leading to speculation about his whereabouts and rumors that he continues to advise the royal court from behind the scenes. He was not among 11 people indicted by Saudi authorities in Khashoggi\u2019s killing, even after Saudi prosecutors detailed his prominent role in the operation.\n\nQahtani did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on the accusations and the Twitter suspension. Saudi officials have denied that prisoners in the kingdom are tortured.\n\nTwitter said Friday that it also has suspended six Saudi accounts that had presented themselves as independent media outlets. The company\u2019s investigations found they were actually \u201clinked to Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-run media apparatus which were engaged in coordinated efforts to amplify messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the company removed 267 accounts from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt that were agitating primarily against Qatar, as well as Iran, the statement said. The network of accounts \u201calso amplified messaging supportive of the Saudi government,\u201d Twitter said.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was sanctioned by the United States last year for his role in the operation that killed Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi.", "authors": ["Kareem Fahim", "Istanbul Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/u3G7DcQ600whTLinjD6kOxkzjnc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2YTUO7SRQII6TCFB5U2G6DWJJ4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
