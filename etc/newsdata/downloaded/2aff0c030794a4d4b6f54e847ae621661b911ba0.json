He was Miami\u2019s opening day starter this year.\n\nPittsburgh had gone in front in the eighth as Jason Martin scored on Jarlin Garcia\u2019s wild pitch with two outs and the bases loaded.\n\nFrazier led off the first inning with a home run, drove in three runs and had three of the Pirates\u2019 four hits. Pittsburgh lost for just the third time in 11 games.\n\nMiami All-Star Sandy Alcantara remained winless since June 21, a span of 12 starts, as he allowed four runs and three hits in seven-plus innings with seven strikeouts and four walks.\n\nPirates rookie right-hander Mitch Keller left the game in the second inning when he sustained a bruised right wrist when struck by Cooper\u2019s line comebacker.\n\nConsidered the organization\u2019s top prospect coming into the season, Keller retired all five batters he faced in his eighth major league start.\n\nKeller was struck flush on the outer part of the wrist. The Pirates said initial imaging revealed only a bruise.\n\nFrazier\u2019s two-run single to right field in the bottom of the fifth tied the game at 3-3. The Marlins had pulled ahead in the top of the inning on Cooper\u2019s RBI double to deep center field.\n\nAfter Frazier staked the Pirates to a quick lead, the Marlins moved ahead 2-1 in the third inning as a throwing error by third baseman Colin Moran on Cooper\u2019s two-out grounder allowed two runs to score.\n\nINSTANT OFFENSE\n\nFrazier\u2019s leadoff blast marked the fourth time in five games the Pirates started a game with a home run. The second baseman had one and SS Kevin Newman hit two during a four-game sweep last weekend at Colorado.\n\nOH BROTHER\n\nLHP Brian Moran was called up by the Marlins from Class AAA New Orleans along with C Tyler Heineman and OF Magneuris Sierra. Moran is the older brother of Colin Moran and reached the major leagues for the first time after spending 10 years in the minors.\n\nThe Morans are nephews of longtime major leaguer B.J. Surhoff.\n\nThe Marlins designated C Wilkin Castillo for assignment and transferred 3B/OF Brian Anderson (fractured right hand) to the 60-day injured list from the 10-day IL to open spots on the 40-man roster.\n\nNEW OLD PIRATE\n\nLHP Wei-Chung Wang was added to the Pirates\u2019 active roster three days after being claimed off waivers from the Oakland Athletics. The Pirates signed Wang from Taiwan as an amateur international free agent in 2011 then lost him two years later to the Milwaukee Brewers in the Rule 5 Draft\n\nMartin, an outfielder, was called up from Triple-A Indianapolis as were RHP Yacksel Rios, C Steven Barron and INF Cole Tucker.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: RHP Robert Dugger (0-1, 4.50 ERA) is scheduled to make his third major league start on Wednesday night in the middle game of the three-game series.\n\nPirates: RHP Trevor Williams (7-6, 5.26) has won back-to-back starts, allowing three runs in 13 innings.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Miguel Rojas hit a tying home run with two outs in the ninth inning and Garrett Cooper connected in the 10th as the Miami Marlins rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night, ending their franchise-record 15-game road losing streak.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Perrotto"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/aptopix_marlins_pirates_baseball_87869_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416"}
