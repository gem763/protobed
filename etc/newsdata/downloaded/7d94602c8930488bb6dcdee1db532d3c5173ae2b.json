The swing away from Labor between 2007 and 2019 was a full third of the electorate.\n\nIt\u2019s the pointy end of a bigger problem. Since the 1970s, Labor\u2019s primary vote has bounced around a bit. But the trend has been a slow, persistent decline of almost 1 per cent per election.\n\nPost the 2019 election, there has been discussion of whether Labor should move right or left. I wonder if that framework, implying that every voter and viewpoint can be neatly plotted on a linear plane, is relevant or useful.\n\nToday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Steve Bannon are two of the most vocal critics of globalisation. Jeremy Corbyn and Donald Trump have advocated similar policies on trade, re-industrialisation and criminal justice reform.\n\nAnd we see it here too. Friedrich Hayek would have a heart attack if he saw the level of state intervention and spending Australia's conservatives have signed up to. On climate, Labor has advocated a market-based solution, and the Liberals direct intervention.\n\nI do not see right and left as our community's defining political division. I see new fault lines that are increasingly important at the ballot box.\n\nNot everyone with a concern about the immigration rate is a bigot. Not everyone with a hesitation about changing gender roles is sexist.\n\nFault lines between winners and losers in a digital economy, and between those who relish economic change and those who resist it. Between Australians who cherish the past, and those who relish change. Between those worried about global interdependence and those who see opportunity for global influence. Between open and closed, authoritarian and decentralised, elites and masses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think of Australian society as a Venn diagram where big circles are breaking into smaller ones and moving from the centre to the edge of the page. The overlap of those circles - the views, values and life experiences we share - feels smaller. As new divisions open up, society is fragmenting into smaller and more zealous groups, more susceptible to populism.\n\nAll this makes political leadership much tougher, and much more important. Political allegiances aren\u2019t static. If politics is different, we need to do things differently.\n\nOn policy, we need to articulate a new narrative on the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d isn\u2019t quite a thing of the past, but it seems cultural issues are the preferred shorthand for who speaks for voters and not to them.\n\nOne of the most upsetting things I've heard people say after the election, especially in the regions, is how we sounded on the doorstep. Many felt that progressives were talking down to them. I know this is not what was intended, but if our voters hear sanctimony, that is what matters.\n\nThat\u2019s why we need to engage in the conversation about political correctness. Some people claim political correctness has gone too far as cheap cover for racism and bigotry. But when our own people - lifelong Labor voters - tell us that they feel they are not allowed to question new social standards that seem to be reset every other week, I think we need to listen.\n\nThis is not about content. It\u2019s about tone. Not everyone with a concern about the immigration rate is a bigot. Not everyone with a hesitation about changing gender roles is sexist. Not every social change is inarguably a good one. If Australians feel they can\u2019t question assumptions and positions in conversation with us, they will find someone else to talk to about it.\n\nI raise these issues not to create trouble, but because this loss is an opportunity for us to ask ourselves some fundamental questions: if politics is changing, who do we seek to represent in Parliament? What are we fighting for on their behalf? And how should we talk with them about their lives in this new era?", "description": "To win back the quiet Australians, Labor must stop talking down and end the political correctness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1757%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_112%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/624b1e08618fa243039ccd0c800c301bd058f81a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
