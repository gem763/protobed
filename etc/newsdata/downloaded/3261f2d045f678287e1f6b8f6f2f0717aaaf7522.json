China punished Norway with years-long, unofficial restrictions on salmon imports and visas after a Norwegian committee awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to the writer Liu Xiaobo, who died in Chinese government custody in 2017.\n\nOver the past year, Beijing has bristled at Western criticism of its sprawling internment network in western Xinjiang, which it defends as a cultural integration and job training campaign for Muslim Uighurs.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Xinjiang has been struck by militant separatist attacks and racial violence in the past, international human rights groups say the Chinese internment program is vastly disproportionate to the threat and tantamount to a wholesale effort to erase the religion and culture of more than 10 million Uighurs.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a fax seeking comment after working hours Thursday. When Tohti was nominated for the prize earlier this month, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang denounced the university lecturer as \u201ca separatist in support of extreme terrorism\u201d who recruited students into militant causes.\n\nGeng called the European Parliament\u2019s consideration of Tohti for the Sakharov Prize \u201can insult on and a travesty to human rights.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Sakharov Prize is named for the late Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov, who was feted by the Soviet system as a star physicist before he became one of its fiercest critics and a staunch human rights campaigner.\n\nFormer winners of the Sakharov Prize include South African leader Nelson Mandela, Pakistani women\u2019s rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai and Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov. Since its inception in 1988, the prize has been given twice to Chinese citizens: veteran pro-democracy activists Hu Jia, in 2008, and Wei Jingsheng, in 1996.\n\nIn a message to The Washington Post late Thursday, Hu, who has spent most of the past two decades in prison and house arrest, said he supported Tohti for the Sakharov Prize in 2016 \u2014 before China ramped up its detention program in Xinjiang \u2014 but he was not chosen.\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The E.U. called Ilham Tohti a \u201cvoice of moderation\u201d; China calls him a supporter of terrorism.", "authors": ["Gerry Shih", "China Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YwTyPIIbKqu-CkYfsCo-bMAdddU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OHVMLDHWLMI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
