The firm also designed original pieces for the Christian Dior fashion show in Marrakech last spring.\n\nA family business now in its third generation, the owners, cousins Soufiane and Ismail Zarib, turned an old riad\u2014a traditional Moroccan courtyard home\u2014in the city\u2019s market district into a store with an international reputation, thanks to its focus on expertly sourced vintage rugs.\n\nFour years ago, the company opened a large showroom in the Medina. Today the firm produces its own carpets, as well as clothing, accessories, and furniture. Here, you\u2019ll find arguably the best rugs in Marrakech, and in a modern, haggle-free environment. \u201cWe like to give people a serious price, and that\u2019s it,\u201d says the 30-year-old Ismail Zarib. \u201cWe do this because we pay more for them.\u201d\n\nNext month, Soufiane Zarib will open a clubhouse next door to the showroom, where international guests will be invited to exclusive dinners and performances. The space will also be used to showcase items of the company\u2019s non-carpet business, with collaborations with local artists exhibited in the space.\n\n\u201cWe want to move away from the bazaar mentality,\u201d Zarib says. \u201cOur main business is carpets, but we don\u2019t want to be just a carpet dealer.\u201d\n\nPENTA : Tell me the company\u2019s backstory. What sets you apart from the hundreds of other carpet dealers in the souk?\n\nIsmail Zarib: It\u2019s a family business. My grandfather used to sell old djellaba [long, unisex robes]. My uncle, which is Soufiane\u2019s father, used to sell carpets, but only to Moroccan people. He used to be very traditional.\n\nWe moved to [the flagship showroom] four years ago. Before that we were in the market, in the souk. We were the first people to take an old riad and turn it into a shop\u2026 When we came to this place, we built it ourselves, designed it ourselves.\n\nWhat happened was, when we started visiting trade shows, it opened our eyes to a different world of carpet business. We started to produce the carpet by ourselves. We started to hire the women [carpet weavers; virtually all carpet weavers in Morocco are women], we started to buy the wool, we buy the colors, we give them the design we want. At the beginning it was very difficult, but then later they started understanding what we want. It took us three to four years of working with them until we got to what we want exactly.\n\nAll the carpets we produce ourselves, we want them to be one-of-a-kind. We don\u2019t want to do mass production.\n\nSoufiane Zarib's showroom in Marrakech. Michael Magers\n\nWhat percentage of carpets that you sell are vintage, and what percentage are of your own design?\n\nFifteen years [ago] everyone wanted to have vintage carpets. But the problem with the vintage carpets\u2026[is] you have to go through a hundred carpets, and you\u2019d pick only five or 10 pieces that are amazing\u2014by colors, by design, by quality. This is what we buy.\n\nBut now they are everywhere. So we still buy the vintage pieces, but only the really, really special ones... It used to be we would sell 90% vintage and 10% new ones. Now it\u2019s almost the opposite. People buy 95% new carpet, and 5% and 10% vintage carpet.\n\nHow many carpets do you have in your collection, total?\n\nWe have almost 50,000 or 60,000 vintage carpets in stock. We know that [many of them] are not sellable right now, but believe that one day people will come back to it. They keep going up in value.\n\nWhat do you look for when you\u2019re sourcing vintage rugs?\n\nThe design is the most important thing you should see in the carpet. Then the quality comes second. Then the condition of the carpet.\n\nOur carpets are really expensive, because we go with the higher quality of the wool. Because there\u2019s many, many, many kids of different type of the wool.\n\nWhat\u2019s the price range?\n\nFor the vintage ones, the price is up or down\u2026it depends on quality. For the new ones, there\u2019s a balance. The prices for lower quality, 10 feet by 14 feet, it\u2019s going to cost you US$1,000. Very good quality will cost you US$3,000-US$3,500. It\u2019s not going to go over that, it\u2019s not going to go lower than that. In between, there\u2019s always something.\n\nYou see a lot about Moroccan carpets recently. Why is that? Is it because they look good on Instagram?\n\nMoroccan carpets are [growing in popularity] in the last 10 years because now there\u2019s a community of people who come to Morocco\u2014especially French people, Spanish people, some American people\u2014they come to Morocco, and most of them, they create an account on Instagram. So what they do, they go to shops, they take several pictures, and they say, \u2018OK, this carpet, it\u2019s mine. I want to sell it.\u2019 Everyone wants to do this now.\n\nIs traditional carpet weaving a dying trade in Morocco?\n\nThe new generation\u2014kids\u2014they don\u2019t work in carpets\u2026 [But for the women in the villages] it creates jobs. We create jobs for these people. Sometimes I go to the places and I found women who have 21, 22, 23 years experience making carpets. And this is a good thing, because she\u2019s making a living now from what she\u2019s doing. Before she used to make it just for her house. Who was going to pay her?\n\nAlso, she\u2019s creating. I give her three or four colors, and I tell her you can do something from your imagination. And sometimes you end up having a nice piece, and this is what we want. We want them to be more creative. We don\u2019t want them to live [the same way] their grandparents or parents used to live.", "description": "The co-owner of the firm Soufiane Zarib on the enduring appeal of Moroccan design", "authors": ["Mitch Moxley"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-110002/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
