Then on Saturday morning, Brown took to Instagram to ask for his release and call his bosses fake. Together, the video and post were the final straw for Gruden and the Raiders, who put an end to the Antonio Brown era by releasing him.\n\nAnd while the decision puts the final touch on an ordeal that clearly represents a complete and total failure on the part of the Raiders\u2019 organization \u2014 which is the biggest loser in this whole ordeal, and we\u2019ll get to it in a bit \u2014 the thing that was so striking about the video was hearing Gruden, a cocksure coach if there ever was one, basically pleading with Brown to knock it off with the antics.\n\nJon Gruden, left, may come to regret the Antonio Brown debacle more than anyone in the Raiders organization. (Reuters)\n\nI mean, here was Gruden, a man whose cursing and sneering and preening for the cameras has made him one of the NFL\u2019s most well-known and popular coaches, clearly at his wits\u2019 end with Brown, a man in whom he had put so much faith.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd it makes sense! Not only did Gruden presumably lead the charge to trade for Brown following the diva wideout\u2019s divorce from the Steelers, one of the few things this year\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks\u201d taught us was how much Gruden was looking forward to calling all those sweet plays he\u2019d drawn up for one of the NFL\u2019s most dynamic players. Only Brown couldn\u2019t get out of his own way enough to ever see the field, instead choosing to make himself the center of attention over the last month in the NFL world with ridiculous controversy after controversy.\n\nIt\u2019s a choice that should cost Brown the $30 million the Raiders guaranteed him in a new deal shortly after they traded for him \u2014 by the way, even Louis Tully from \u201cGhostbusters\u201d could prove in a court of law that Brown\u2019s conduct over the month was detrimental to the team \u2014 but Brown might not even be the biggest loser in all this.\n\n[Watch NFL games live in the Yahoo Sports app, all season long. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nNo, that would be Gruden, who repeatedly said \u201csorry\u201d to Raiders fans in his regularly scheduled Saturday afternoon press conference leading up to their Monday night showdown against Denver.\n\n\u201cWe just have exhausted everything, we\u2019ve tried every way possible to make it work,\u201d Gruden told reporters. \u201cAll I\u2019m gonna say is it\u2019s disappointing. I\u2019m really proud of our coaches, our players, our owner, our front office, we did everything we could to make this work, and I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t. I apologize \u2026 I wish Antonio nothing but the best. I\u2019m sorry we never got a chance to see him in silver and black \u2014 it\u2019s very disappointing in my career as a coach. I really looked forward to coaching him. But it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d\n\nAnd as the man in charge of the Raiders \u2014 which Gruden is, considering he\u2019s entering the second year of a 10-year contract \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what he should have done. This entire ordeal has made the entire organization look bad, starting with the fact they let Brown miss practices and do all sorts of things that would have gotten other players cut faster than you can say \u201cknock on wood if you\u2019re with me.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the very fact that Brown wasn\u2019t cut after his insubordinate blowup with general manager Mike Mayock, which came in front of the entire team, is an embarrassment, one that goes against Raider tradition. Remember, while Al Davis was all for having outlaws, he wasn\u2019t OK with players making themselves bigger than the Raiders. He supposedly benched a Super Bowl MVP, Marcus Allen, during the prime of his career for that very reason.\n\nNo doubt, Al Davis would not have stood for this. But that didn\u2019t keep Gruden from dying on the \u201cA.B. is misunderstood\u201d hill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll yell ya, he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s misunderstood by a lot of people, but he is a good guy, he\u2019s a great player. I hope he gets what he\u2019s looking for.\u201d\n\nJon Gruden (center) might have an accountability problem with his locker room after the Antonio Brown saga. (AP)\n\nBut Gruden may have a bigger problem on his hands, especially if the Raiders get off to another slow start this season. The point of trading away talented cornerstones in Khalil Mack (a team captain) and Amari Cooper a year ago was to bring in his old guys and establish a new culture, but everything about the way they handled Brown undermines the concept of teamwork and accountability that all good football teams embrace.\n\nThe Raiders, point blank, made exceptions for Brown, and while Gruden\u2019s players may never verbalize it, it\u2019s something I suspect they\u2019ll grumble about if and when Gruden tries to rip them or hold them accountable individually. Pro athletes are very perceptive when it comes to figuring out if coaches are practicing what they\u2019re preaching; when a coach isn\u2019t, respect is harder to come by.\n\nI suspect Gruden knows that, because in his address to the media, he also shouted out his remaining players many times.\n\n\u201cI will tell you I am very proud of what we did as an organization,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 12 rookies \u2026 we\u2019ve got a lot to be excited about as we build our team. Unfortunately this has overshadowed a lot of great performances by young people who have put themselves in position to start their career on Monday Night Football.\u201d\n\nAnd if the Raiders lose Monday night, you just know Gruden will continue to get questions about the Brown ordeal and whether it had an affect on the result. It will be poetic, in a way.\n\n\u201cAt least I got to meet Antonio,\u201d Gruden said Saturday, trying to lighten the mood. \u201cI never got to meet Khalil.\u201d\n\nBut if things go sideways for the Raiders this season, no one may come to regret that more than Gruden.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Raiders' head coach put as much faith as anyone in the talented but beleaguered star wideout.
