Rather than own the small mistake and move on - we all make mistakes - Trump has turned this into a five-day story. He\u2019s tweeted nine times and posted five maps about the subject. Last night, he even directed the National Security Council to release a 225-word statement from a rear admiral defending him.\n\nThe Sharpie has long been one of Trump\u2019s blunt instruments of choice, but this week it\u2019s become a symbol just as potent as the MAGA hat. It\u2019s louder, bolder and less delicate than the classier and more conventionally elegant pens that have historically occupied the White House. Just like Trump.\n\nHis Sharpie squiggles on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map are worth more than 1,000 words. Trump seems unable to admit mistakes, no matter how trivial, because he appears to see such concessions as a sign of weakness. He becomes easily distracted by detritus at the expense of tackling the existential challenges facing our country, from climate change to the national debt.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a minor episode, but I hope that doctored map makes its way into the Smithsonian someday. Like Washington\u2019s uniform or Jefferson\u2019s desk, Trump\u2019s bogus map embodies the man,\u201d writes columnist Eugene Robinson. \u201cAs smooth moves go, it was lamer than trying to forge a $100 bill by taking a Monopoly $1 bill and writing a couple of extra zeros on it.\u201d\n\nForcing senior aides to contort themselves in defense of his false statements is a feature, not a bug, of the Trump administration. This dates to Sean Spicer\u2019s monologue on crowd sizes after the inauguration, which set the tone for everything that\u2019s followed. Aides have tried to substantiate Trump\u2019s specious claims that he was wiretapped, that millions of votes were illegally cast by undocumented immigrants and that Middle Easterners had joined the caravans approaching the southern border. He said that right before the midterm elections during the same speeches in which he claimed that a plan was in the works to cut middle-class taxes by 10 percent. It hadn\u2019t been, but then staff scrambled to make it seem like an idea that was actually under consideration. The list goes on and on.\n\n\u201cEven when Trump mistakenly tweeted the nonsensical word \u2018covfefe\u2019 late one night, the president, instead of owning up to a typo or errant message, later sent Spicer to declare, \u2018I think the president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,\u2019\u201d recalls the AP\u2019s Jonathan Lemire.\n\nAs Trump put it in 2016, \u201cI think apologizing\u2019s a great thing, but you have to be wrong. I will absolutely apologize, sometime in the hopefully distant future, if I\u2019m ever wrong.\u201d\n\nOr, as George Orwell wrote in \u201c1984,\u201d 2+2=5.\n\nTrump has a notorious history of struggling to let certain things go once he becomes fixated on them. In April 1988, Spy magazine mockingly referred to Trump as a \u201cshort-fingered vulgarian\u201d in a satirical advertisement for \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which was on the bestseller list at the time. The co-founder of that magazine was Graydon Carter, who would go on to lead Vanity Fair for a quarter of a century. In October 2015, Carter said that the insult still got under Trump\u2019s skin. \u201cTo this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is always a photo of him - generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers. I almost feel sorry for the poor fellow because, to me, the fingers still look abnormally stubby.\u201d\n\nThursday afternoon, Trump beckoned Fox News correspondent John Roberts to the Oval Office after a 3 p.m. live shot to make the case that he was correct about Dorian - because Alabama had been in the potential path early on - and to complain about anchor Shepard Smith\u2019s coverage on his show, according to internal Fox emails leaked to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n\nSharpies have played a starring role in several of the most memorable moments from this epoch. In his tell-all book, former West Wing communications aide Cliff Sims recounts in detail a private huddle in which he and Keith Schiller, the president\u2019s longtime bodyguard and confidant, helped Trump draw up an enemies list with a Sharpie on White House stationery. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get rid of all the snakes, even the bottom-feeders,\u201d Trump told the men, according to Sims\u2019s account in \u201cTeam of Vipers,\u201d released in January.\n\nDuring a listening session after the massacre last year at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Trump held a note card in his hand with a basic reminder of emotional empathy. \u201cI hear you\u201d was written out in Sharpie.\n\nWhen an outbreak of tornados killed 23 people in Alabama this March, Trump visited the state. He used his Sharpie to sign several Bibles at a Baptist church that had been converted into a relief center.\n\nTwo days before he became president, Trump tweeted a picture of himself holding a legal pad at Mar-a-Lago while looking earnestly into a camera. He wrote that it was an image of himself composing his inaugural address. He was upset at that time about stories on which aides were drafting the speech, and he wanted to insist that he wrote it himself. In that picture, Trump is holding a closed Sharpie. The pad looks brand new.\n\nAn auction house sold a doodle this spring that Trump once drew in gold Sharpie of the Manhattan skyline. In it, Trump Tower dominates neighboring skyscrapers. In real life, it doesn\u2019t. Trump has long claimed that the building he named after himself has 68 stories. In fact, it has 58.\n\nWhen Trump started using Twitter, he didn\u2019t post the tweets himself. He\u2019d write them down in Sharpie on a piece of paper, and a 20-something staffer named Justin McConney would type them up. Eventually, Trump got an Android phone and started typing his own tweets one night in February 2013. \u201cThe moment I found out Trump could tweet himself was comparable to the moment in \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 when Dr. Grant realized that velociraptors could open doors,\u201d McConney told Politico last year. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh no.\u2019\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["The Washington", "James Hohmann", "The Washington Post"], "top_image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/rs6fChwgLa-GXXdh5W4v7RpgJ8o=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LZPFQKQWHFE7BAHNCCUZT7NC64.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
