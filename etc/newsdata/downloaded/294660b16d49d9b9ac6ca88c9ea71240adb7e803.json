We must admit we failed to reach consensus because three states refused to invite both countries to start negotiations,\u201d Lithuania\u2019s President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters.\n\n\u201cEverybody admits that North Macedonia did a lot: it changed the country\u2019s name, it changed its constitution and did everything to receive an invitation, so I think the absence of decision will have serious political consequences.\u201d\n\n\u2013 France stands firm \u2013\n\nFrance \u2014 where EU enlargement is a sensitive topic among the public \u2014 agues that the accession process needs reform and Skopje and Tirana should wait until this has happened.\n\nAhead of the summit, incoming European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned the \u201csigns were not good\u201d for the two countries, but urged leaders not to shut the door on them.\n\n\u201cI am utterly convinced that these two countries have made enormous efforts to meet European norms and I would very much like them to receive a positive signal,\u201d she said Thursday.\n\nCritics have warned that dashing the hopes of the Balkan states risks fuelling nationalist movements in a volatile region and driving them closer to Moscow.\n\nThe summit deadlock also comes as a blow to von der Leyen\u2019s hopes of building a more \u201cgeopolitical\u201d EU capable of imposing itself on assertive powers like Russia and China.\n\nAt an EU foreign ministers\u2019 meeting this week before the summit, France blocked attempts to treat the two cases separately.\n\nFrench intransigence on the issue is infuriating some other EU countries who warn the bloc will lose credibility in the Balkans if it does not live up to its promises, opening the door to Russia and China to boost their influence.\n\nParis is reluctant to open the door to new members while problems with corruption or rule of law in existing eastern members such as Romania and Hungary gnaw away at EU unity.\n\nVon der Leyen and the current commission chief she is to replace, Jean-Claude Juncker, have been vocal about starting the accession talks, while pointing out that the process does not guarantee EU membership.", "description": "Brussels (AFP) \u2013 Bitterly divided EU leaders failed Friday to reach agreement on allowing Albania and North Macedonia to start talks to join the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/d150d0_french-president-emmanuel-macron-has-led-opposition-north-macedonia-albania-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
