Wasabi bubble tea with wasabi pearls (left) and cocoa milk tea with mala pearls by Playmade and Singtel\u2019s Gomo. Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nDoes liquid wasabi sound in anyway enticing to you?\n\nBecause if it does, boy, do we have good news for you.\n\nTaiwanese bubble tea chain Playmade \u2013 known for making fresh tapioca pearls in various original flavours \u2013 is selling wasabi milk tea complete with wasabi pearls from now till October 14.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not stopping there.\n\nThe brand will also launch a cocoa milk tea with mala (yes, just like the spicy hotpot soup) pearls from October 15 to 31, thanks to a month-long Halloween collaboration with Singtel\u2019s digital-only brand Gomo.\n\nImagine this in your bubble tea. The New Paper\n\nAccording to Singtel\u2019s spokesman, the wasabi-flavoured pearls are made with pure wasabi powder imported from Japan, while the mala-flavoured pearls are created from a special homemade mala sauce from Taiwan.\n\nAnd like all Playmade pearls, they are freshly prepared at Playmade stores in Singapore daily.\n\nAll that sounds impressive, although we\u2019re still not sure why anyone would think of the concoction in the first place. But the truth is that someone did and even turned it into reality \u2013 so here we are, again pushing the boundaries of what bubble tea can be.\n\nThe taste test: Trick or treat?\n\nWe did it for you. Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nI\u2019ll be honest \u2013 I was scared to try either of the flavours, especially after a Singtel representative likened the wasabi flavour to \u201cdrinking liquid wasabi\u201d.\n\ncaption The mala pearls (left) come served in a cocoa drink, while the wasabi is added to a wasabi milk tea. source Singtel\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the two pearl flavours after rinsing out the tea.\n\ncaption They look completely harmless, don\u2019t they? source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nFirst up: cocoa milk tea with mala pearls\n\nThe cocoa milk tea was actually very pleasant. It can be quite difficult to find good cocoa drinks in Singapore, so I was very happy to find Playmade\u2019s version had a rich and dark intensity and a balanced amount of sweetness.\n\nDepending on your tolerance to spice, the mala pearls may or may not give you a fright. One of my colleagues bit into five pearls at once and felt nothing, but another felt it was too spicy.\n\nAs for me, I found the spice of one single pearl just about right, but I did not dare to chew into more than one at the same time. The mala taste was quite well-delivered, and the drink as a whole reminded me of gourmet chilli chocolates made by high-end chocolatiers.\n\ncaption Cocoa milk tea with mala pearls \u2013 available from Oct 15 to 31 \u2013 is priced at S$4.50 for a medium, and S$6.50 for a large. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nNext up: wasabi milk tea with wasabi pearls\n\nAfter a not-too-shocking experience with the mala pearls, I took a deep breath before inhaling a huge gulp of wasabi milk tea.\n\nAnd just as promised, it tasted exactly like wasabi in drink form. In fact, the taste of wasabi was so strong that I could not taste much wasabi in the pearls themselves. Later on, I separated the pearls from the tea to taste them on their own, and found them slightly spicy, though not as much as the mala ones.\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has a low-tolerance to spice, found both the drink and the wasabi pearls too spicy for her liking. As for me, while the drink was not that spicy, I still don\u2019t get the idea of putting wasabi in milk tea.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying this, I\u2019d suggest having a bottle of water on standby to wash the flavour down because a whole cup of wasabi milk tea quickly becomes overwhelming after just a couple of sips.\n\ncaption Wasabi pearls in wasabi milk tea \u2013 available only till Oct 14 \u2013 costs S$4.20 for a medium and S$6.10 for a large. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nFor now, the jury\u2019s still out on whether these \u201cGomoween\u201d drinks are a trick or a treat. But I can safely say I wouldn\u2019t go back for seconds.\n\nThe drinks are available for all adventurous bubble tea lovers to buy, but Gomo customers get a S$2 discount on large-sized drinks.\n\nThose who post their reactions to the bubble tea flavours on Instagram Stories can also get a free upsize on their next Playmade drink.\n\ncaption Posting one\u2019s reaction to the drinks will score them a free upgrade on the next order, but they must tag @singtel and @playmadeonezo and show the Instagram story to Playmade\u2019s staff within 24 hours to get it. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Do you consider wasabi milk tea and mala pearls a trick or a treat?.
