But you know what? No. I am not your dancing monkey, not anymore.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNia and their peers watching from backstage and seriously did not appreciate Ronda\u2019s attitude.\n\nThe WWE crowd, on the other hand, were losing their minds.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t just take one person to make you a star,\u2019 Nia said during a confessional. \u2018You are not the only person in this world. But, for some reason, you think that you can just walk on water and that nobody can touch you.\n\nNia has no time for haters (Picture: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images)\n\nRonda has been feeling like she doesn\u2019t belong in WWE (Picture: Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018At the WWE, we\u2019re a family. How dare you disrespect all the women who have laid the groundwork for you. No. I\u2019m not gonna frickin\u2019 stand for this.\u2019\n\nNia didn\u2019t just use the confessional, she made sure her feelings were heard by the former UFC fighter.\n\nShe told Ronda: \u2018Uh, that\u2019s like disrespectful though,\u2019 to which the fighter replied: \u2018I didn\u2019t mean any disrespect.\u2019\n\nIn the world of WWE, dramatic clashes like this are expected, but especially when Nia isn\u2019t shy about making sure her opinions are heard.\n\n\u2018It just seems like I\u2019m constantly offending people because I\u2019m not living by rules that I don\u2019t even know,\u2019 Ronda later said to her husband Travis Browne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf WWE turns out to be the wrong decision for Ronda, at least she has her great gig going on with FOX\u2019s 9-1-1.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
