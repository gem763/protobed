(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nFor decades when there was news, there was Cokie Roberts.\n\nThe Emmy-winning mainstay reporter for NPR and ABC News died at 75 on Tuesday, ABC said, after a long and storied career that began in the 1960s.\n\nAlmost instantly, her death prompted a wave of condolences across social media, particularly from women in the industry who regarded Roberts as a role model when the voice and names of men crowded newspaper bylines and radio waves.\n\n\u201cSad news about one of our founding mothers,\u201d wrote Michele Kelemen, an NPR correspondent who has been with the outlet for more than two decades.\n\nFor many women, Roberts was the reason they pursued a career in journalism.\n\n\u201cA legend has passed,\u201d NPR\u2019s Rachel Martin said. \u201cWhen I was in high school I wanted to grow up to be Cokie Roberts.\u201d\n\nCokie Roberts inspired me to become a journalist (and go to \u2066@Wellesley\u2069) She was one of the few women on Sunday talks shows when I was growing up. She was always smart, fierce and insightful.\n\n\n\nI was fortunate to meet her a few times at CNN. #RIPCokie #thankyou pic.twitter.com/gLez9qSbKo \u2014 Heather Long (@byHeatherLong) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cCokie Roberts inspired me to become a journalist (and go to Wellesley),\u201d Washington Post reporter Heather Long said on Twitter. \u201cShe was one of the few women on Sunday talks shows when I was growing up. She was always smart, fierce and insightful.\u201d\n\nFarrah Fazal, an investigative reporter, said the death of Roberts was a \u201ccomplete, irreplaceable loss\u201d to the field. \u201cShe was a pioneer, a mentor, committed to integrity and truth, a driving force in trying to change the system that held women back.\u201d\n\nOther reporters recalled Roberts\u2019s career wisdom.\n\n\u201cThe advice from @CokieRoberts was consistent,\u201d journalist and former NPR host Michele Norris tweeted. \u201cForget the office politics. Just do the work \u2026 She read my copy and pushed me to write in my own voice.\u201d\n\nThe advice from @CokieRoberts was consistent. Forget the office politics. Just do the work. She knew I was a writer and told me that was the ace in my deck. She advocated for me to get assignments. She read my copy and pushed me to write in my own voice \u2014 Michele Norris (@michele_norris) September 17, 2019\n\nNina Totenberg, an NPR legal affairs reporter, said she bid Roberts farewell Monday evening.\n\n\u201cThe world will be a lesser place without my darling friend, Cokie Roberts,\u201d Totenberg said. \u201cTold her I\u2019d see her on the other side some day, where I know she will still be a star.\u201d\n\nTotenberg praised Roberts\u2019s reporting and writing prowess in a longer tribute posted by NPR, where Totenberg says her friend\u2019s death left the newsroom in tears. But she also remembered a woman who was \u201cthe personification of human decency\u201d \u2014 the kind of person who spoke often at funerals, visited casual friends in the hospital and helped those in need.\n\nRoberts did not let her cancer keep her from giving speeches, making media appearances and doing her work, Totenberg said. She had planned to attend last week\u2019s Democratic primary debate until \u201cher disease finally trumped her grit,\u201d as Totenberg put it. And she went out to the movies with Totenberg and others 10 days ago despite her pain and the fact she could hardly eat.\n\n\u201cThere was not a chance she was going to cancel commitments, no matter how rotten she felt,\u201d Totenberg wrote. \u201cThere was not a chance she would just lie in bed.\u201d\n\nThis was always my fav photo to come across in the communication department's files at @NPR. These 3 women really shaped how I viewed a workplace and journalism in general. I always wanted to know what they were laughing about & wish I had been in on the joke. RIP #Cokie. pic.twitter.com/S8hO64bi3A \u2014 andy danyo kubis (@andykubis) September 17, 2019\n\nSo so sad. Cokie and Steve helped guide me in countless ways as a young journalist on Capitol Hill. She was both a mentor and a friend. Her work will continue in the generations of journalists whose careers she helped to shape. https://t.co/5dGxojWG20 \u2014 julie rovner (@jrovner) September 17, 2019\n\nI never had the honor of meeting Cokie Roberts, but I loved hearing her voice and her reporting and analysis over the decades. The fact that I\u2019ll never hear her on Wednesday mornings during her \u201cAsk Cokie\u201d segment breaks my heart. \ud83d\udc94 https://t.co/JqbzEz75fv \u2014 Julia Ioffe (@juliaioffe) September 17, 2019\n\nheartbreaking. Cokie was one of the women I looked up to as a young girl who wanted to be a journalist, and as an adult, I loved her weekly segments on NPR \u2014 they were refreshing. https://t.co/hMiw7AcISX \u2014 Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) September 17, 2019\n\nCokie Roberts was an icon and treasure in American political reporting. She was - and is - an absolute role model for women in this field. https://t.co/PCWcNXf96B \u2014 Jessica Huseman (@JessicaHuseman) September 17, 2019\n\nThe world will be a lesser place without my darling friend, Cokie Roberts, who died early this morning. I said good-bye last night. Told her I'd see her on the other side some day, where I know she will still be a star. pic.twitter.com/Ei8d2zkHAb \u2014 Nina Totenberg (@NinaTotenberg) September 17, 2019\n\nCokie Roberts was gracious and elegant, smart and funny. Just last week, she spoke at the home of a friend of mine to raise money for cancer research. She gave of her time and her heart. May her memory be a blessing. https://t.co/xAWvpMyJjR \u2014 Sheryl Gay Stolberg (@SherylNYT) September 17, 2019\n\nRoberts joined CBS on the radio as a foreign correspondent soon after her 1964 graduation from Wellesley College. She covered Capitol Hill for NPR beginning in 1978, when she reported on the Panama Canal Treaty, then served as congressional correspondent for more than a decade, according to ABC News.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Roberts \u201ca trailblazer who forever transformed the role of women in the newsroom and in our history books.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver five decades of celebrated journalism, Cokie shone a powerful light on the unsung women heroes who built our nation, but whose stories had long gone untold,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cAs she helped tell the full story of America\u2019s history, she helped shape its future \u2014 inspiring countless young women and girls to follow in her groundbreaking footsteps.\u201d\n\nHarrison Smith contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nCokie Roberts, Emmy-winning journalist and political commentator, dies at 75", "description": "\"Cokie was one of the women I looked up to as a young girl who wanted to be a journalist,\" a CNN reporter said.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm", "Alex Horton Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
