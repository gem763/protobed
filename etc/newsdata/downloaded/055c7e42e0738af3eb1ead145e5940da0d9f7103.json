NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrotet has been marshalling support for the scheme, which would help fund large infrastructure projects designed to fire-up the economy. But Josh Frydenberg dismised the idea on Friday, maintaining there were other ways the states could fuel growth - like changes to tax arrangements and making public departments more efficient. Treasurer Frydenberg told Sky News on Friday he would not put any sweeteners on the table. \u201cThey don\u2019t need any financial incentives to recycle their assets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown both a willingness and an ability to do that in the past and we\u2019ll leave them to do that into the future.\u201d Image: News Corp Australia", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
