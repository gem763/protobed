Just how fast can a human run? Success for Kipchoge will open a new chapter in that particular book.\n\nFor the sports fans, the run is, admittedly, of limited value in the sense that it is not an actual race. But they will be well aware that once a door on achievement is nudged ajar then it isn\u2019t long before it is barged wide open.\n\nFor them Kipchoge is the pacemaker who will drag the rest of the road-running world with him.\n\n\u201cAny human being can go beyond their limits,\u201d says the marathon world record holder.\n\n\u201cNo human being should be limited in their thoughts, in what he or she should be doing.\u201d\n\nIn that he is following in a rich tradition of people who pushed the limits and broke new ground in the process.\n\n\u2013 Jim Hines \u2013\n\nAt some point in the early 1870s \u2013 the official date is not recorded \u2013 a young Pennsylvania student Walter Halben Butler, who would later make it into the US House of Representatives, became the first person to be credited with running the 100-yard dash in under 10 seconds.\n\nIt would be almost 100 years before the 10-second mark fell in the 100 metres.\n\nCharlie Paddock could not do it, nor could Jackson Schultz and Harold Abrams. Not even the legendary Jesse Owens.\n\nInstead, Bob Hayes is credited with running the first unofficial sub-10 \u2014 a 9.9 in 1963. He lowered the official world record a year later when he won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 10.06.\n\nIt was Arkansas runner Jim Hines who officially cracked the mythic mark, with a gold medal winning time of 9.95s at altitude in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico.\n\nToday, the record belongs to Usain Bolt who broke the record three times, lowering it from 9.74s to 9.58s, which he ran at the world championships in Berlin in 2009.\n\nWomen have yet to crash through the mark. Florence Griffith-Joyner\u2019s record of 10.49s was set over 30 years ago in 1988.\n\n\u2013 Roger Bannister \u2013\n\nThe passage of time has gilded the quest to break the four-minute barrier for the mile, a distance not seen often in today\u2019s metric athletics world.\n\nIt was a big deal back in the 1950s as the Australian John Landy and Briton Roger Bannister competed to be the first.\n\nBannister, who had come fourth in the 1952 Olympic 1500m, got there first. The medical student ran 3:59.4 seconds to break the world record at Iffley Road in Oxford and shatter the psychological ceiling.\n\nSix weeks later Landy brought it down to 3:58.0. By the end of the decade it was down to 3:54.5 \u2014 the current record stands at 3:43.13, set by Hicham El Guerrouj in 1999.\n\nThe four-minute mark remains a barrier for the women \u2013 world 1500m champion Sifan Hassan took Svetlana Masterkova\u2019s record in July with a run of 4:12.33 in Monaco.\n\n\u2013 Jacques Mayol \u2013\n\nThe Mediterranean has long been the source of stories of divers plunging into Poseidon\u2019s kitchen in the search of treasure, usually in the shape of sponge and pearl or perhaps to pilfer the wreck of an unfortunate ship.\n\nIt was in the Med, just off the island of Elba that a free diver descended for the first time to a depth of 100 metres. No breathing apparatus, just a powerful set of human lungs and the desire to push the limits.\n\nFrenchman Jacques Mayol was fascinated with diving and dolphins since growing up in Japan. He developed a mix of relaxation and yoga breathing to enable him to hold his breath for up to five minutes. His pulse would drop from 70 to 20 beats per minute.\n\nHe developed a friendship and rivalry with the Italian Enzo Maiorca as they pushed each other to go deeper \u2013 the basis for Luc Besson\u2019s 1988 film \u201cThe Big Blue\u201d.\n\nOn November 23, 1976 the 56-year-old Mayol hit the 100m mark.\n\nHe later went down to 105m and predicted that people would be able to go to 200m \u2013 today\u2019s record is held by Herbert Nitsch who went to a depth of 253m in 2012.\n\n\u2013 Felix Baumgartner \u2013\n\nThe idea of descent is not centred solely on water. As soon as flight was made possible thanks to the invention of the hot-air balloon, people begin to imagine the fun to be had from climbing out of the balloon and floating down to earth.\n\nFrenchman Andre-Jacques Garnerin is credited with the first parachute jump from approximately 1,000 metres in Parc Monceau in Paris.\n\nIt developed into a means of warfare but continued as a sport with driven individuals looking to go higher than anyone else. Could anyone parachute from space?\n\nUS Air Force Colonel Joseph Kittinger jumped from 31 kilometres in 1960, freefalling at Mach 0.91, but it was the Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner who shattered the world\u2019s idea on how high and how fast a person could go.\n\nIn 1999, Baumgartner served notice of his daring when he claimed the world record for making a parachute jump from a building, leaping from the 450-metre Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn October 2012, with 84-year-old Kittinger as part of his team, Baumgartner went for something even more spectacular \u2013 he jumped from the edge of the earth\u2019s atmosphere, a height of 39,035 metres, using a pressure suit and a parachute.\n\nHe reached a maximum velocity of 373 metres per second and became the first man (outside an aeroplane) to break the sound barrier, his speed reaching Mach 1.24.\n\nThe huge publicity \u2013 more than eight million people watched live on YouTube \u2013 meant the world knew his name.\n\nFew people are aware that Baumgartner\u2019s altitude record fell just two years later when American computer scientist Alan Eustace fell from 41,419 metres. It is only a matter of time before the record goes again.\n\n\u2013 Sarah Thomas \u2013\n\nThere has been plenty of traffic between the coasts of England and France since Britain was separated from continental Europe around 8,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, but it was only in 1875 that Matthew Webb became the first person recorded to have swum between the two coasts.\n\nThe straight line distance is approximately 36 kilometres through one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.\n\nSwimmers, though, are slaves to the tides and often have to swim much further while coping with the cold and the jellyfish \u2013 Webb complained of being stung when he made his crossing.\n\nAlthough it remains an impressive feat, it is no longer a headline moment \u2013 unless you push the limits ever further as American breast cancer survivor Sarah Thomas did last month.\n\nThe 37-year-old received the cancer diagnosis four months after an unprecedented August 2017 non-stop solo swim of 104.6 miles in Lake Champlain on the US-Canada border and underwent treatment in the summer of 2018.\n\nThat did not stop her tackling the English Channel for a third time. Twice before she had made single crossings, this time she went a bit further, becoming the first person to swim the Channel four times non-stop.\n\nHer swim, which took her a remarkable 54 hours, covered around 209 kilometres.\n\nHer achievement and, indeed, those of all the barrier breakers, was summed up in a tweet from fellow-swimmer Lewis Pugh.\n\n\u201cJust when we think we\u2019ve reached the limit of human endurance, someone shatters the records,\u201d he said.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s bid on Saturday to become the first person to run a marathon in under two hours will excite scientists and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/49d5ea_eliud-kipchoge-is-bidding-person-run-marathon-in-two-hours-pushing-boundaries-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
