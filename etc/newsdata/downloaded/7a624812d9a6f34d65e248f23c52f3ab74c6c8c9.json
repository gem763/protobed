Graham rallies to Trump's defense", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Four years ago, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was so infuriated by fellow primary contender Sen. Lindsey Graham calling him \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest jackass\u201d that he gave out the senior South Carolina senator\u2019s phone number in public, making sure to call him an \u201cidiot\u201d as he did so.\n\nGraham was not amused. \u201cI think the beginning of the end has come\u201d for the Trump campaign, he predicted.\n\nNow, in 2019, Trump is the president of the United States, while Graham is his frequent golfing partner \u2014 and, more to the point, one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders in Congress.\n\nThat loyalty was on display on Thursday afternoon, when Graham held a press conference at the U.S. Capitol to denounce the impeachment inquiry that now threatens Trump\u2019s presidency. That inquiry is based on allegations that Trump attempted to pressure authorities in Ukraine to investigate the business affairs of Hunter Biden, whose father, former Vice President Joe Biden, is running for president.\n\nThe stated purpose of the press conference was the introduction of a resolution co-sponsored with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and endorsed by more than 40 other Republicans, calling on the House to vote on opening a formal impeachment inquiry, something House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has resisted doing so far.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a former prosecutor who heads the House Intelligence Committee, has handled the inquiry, in particular by what they see as his undue emphasis on secrecy. They have tried to censure Schiff; on Wednesday, Republican House members stormed the secure basement room in the Capitol, where the hearings have been taking place, demanding Schiff make witness testimony public.\n\nTrump praised the stunt. \u201cThank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart,\u201d he wrote in a Twitter message, \u201cand understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History.\u201d\n\nGraham seemed intent on reminding Trump that Republicans in the upper chamber of Congress were behind him too. In the press conference, Graham criticized the impeachment inquiry as procedurally flawed, without bothering to dispute the charges of political interference in foreign affairs that have informed that inquiry.\n\nIn his press conference, Graham compared the impeachment inquiry to the Star Chamber, the notorious closed court of medieval England, calling it a \u201crogue action.\u201d He said the proceedings were a \u201cdanger to the future of the presidency,\u201d decrying in particular what he described as efforts to \u201cdrive down a president\u2019s poll numbers\u201d through damaging leaks of the kind that have emerged from the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the first time leaks were weaponized for polls. During the inquiry into the killing of four Americans at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy admitted that driving down the approval rating for Hillary Clinton, who\u2019d been secretary of state at the time and would subsequently run for president, had been one of the goals.\n\n\u201cGod help future presidents,\u201d Graham said.\n\nGraham is among the Senate\u2019s most skilled operators and knows full well that a Senate resolution has no power over Schiff and House Democrats. Instead, the resolution is intended to counter the growing sense that even the president\u2019s staunchest allies are having a difficult time defending him, as evidence piles up that he attempted to engage in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.", "description": "Sen.
