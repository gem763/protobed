And their plans may have been in the works for a while.\n\nWith U.S. forces opening the gates for Turkey to take over northeast Syria, Trump administration officials are now drawing up plans to keep several hundred U.S. troops alongside Arab rebel groups in the country\u2019s oil-rich southeast. Trump has said, \u201cwe have secured the oil.\u201d And Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) diplomats have said they\u2019re willing to work with such a plan.\n\nThe National Interest has learned that the Trump administration\u2019s anti-ISIS team, led by Ambassador James Jeffrey, has floated the idea of a counter-Iran presence in Deir ez-Zor for some time now.\n\n\u201cEvery day, the [U.S.-led] coalition has been very strong against [Syrian ruler] Assad,\u201d said Omar Abu Layla, CEO of Deirezzor24, who said that he has seen U.S. helicopters and F-35 fighter jets increase their presence against Iranian-backed forces in the region.\n\nAbu Layla told the National Interest that he spoke to Jeffrey\u2019s team three or four months ago. \u201cThey promised, \u2018we will not leave Syria before we kick Iran out of Syria,\u2019\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey will not leave our province easily.\u201d\n\n\"Since December, President Trump has been clear that American forces would be withdrawing from Syria. At the President\u2019s directive, the State Department, including Ambassador Jeffrey, has been working with the Department of Defense on a deliberate and coordinated withdrawal of American forces overtime, while also working with our partners on the ground to maintain consistent pressure to ensure ISIS\u2019s enduring defeat,\" a State Department spokesperson told the National Interest. \"We do not discuss details of our diplomatic engagements but our message on this has been consistent with all of our partners in Syria.\"\n\n\u201cI can assure you that the effort to push back against Iran are real and continuous, unlike what the last administration did that picked Iran as its strategic security partner in the Middle East,\u201d said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on October 20.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear how feasible a long-term U.S. presence will be without the Kurdish core of the SDF.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a Fort Apache scenario,\u201d former Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk, who ran the anti-ISIS team at the end of the Obama administration and beginning of the Trump administration, told the National Interest. \u201cVery difficult to resupply.\u201d\n\nMcGurk was describing the difficulty of supplying a military outpost in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\u201cTrying to do more, we\u2019re going to dig a hole deeper\u201d for the Syrian Kurds, McGurk had said at an event earlier today at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nJeffrey has made no secret of his desire to use the U.S. presence in Syria for a counter-Iran mission, even if he is uneasy with his Syrian Kurdish partners. He told the Atlantic Council on December 17 that the United States \u201cdoes not have permanent relationships with substate entities,\u201d referring to the Syrian Kurdish forces, but emphasized that U.S. forces will not leave Syria until all Iranian forces are gone. A few months later, Jeffrey took over McGurk\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI know Jeffrey and others, they have real passion on Syria. They want to do something on Syria. They want to kick Assad out,\u201d said former Syrian diplomat Bassam Barabandi. \u201cThey want the Syrian people to have the chance to elect their leader.\u201d\n\nBarabandi says that he has talked to Jeffrey \u201cmany times\u201d after defecting to America in 2013.\n\nThe end result of Jeffrey\u2019s goals may be a plan to cultivate the Arab branch of the SDF as an independent counter-ISIS, counter-Assad force.\n\n\u201cIt had been under consideration,\u201d said Brian Katz, a former CIA military analyst who served as the Secretary of Defense\u2019s country director for Syria in 2016 and 2017. \u201cSome of these efforts were underway.\u201d\n\nKatz also said there were efforts to tone down the ideological bent of the SDF, which reveres the imprisoned left-wing Kurdish leader Abdullah \u00d6calan. Such a move could reduce the influence of the SDF\u2019s core Kurdish leadership over other factions.\n\nTrump announced after an October 6 phone call with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria.\u201d The announcement kicked off a Turkish attack on the SDF, which Turkey sees as a branch of the Kurdish separatist movement within Turkey.\n\nThe Trump administration brokered a shaky cease-fire solution between the SDF and Turkey, giving U.S. troops time to retreat even as the Turkish offensive resumed in full force. Without U.S. support, the SDF cut deals with the Russian- and Iranian-backed government of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad.\n\nBut the White House\u2019s October 14 statement noted that U.S. forces will remain at al-Tanf, a key outpost in southeastern Syria outside the SDF-controlled zone.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that \u201cwe have secured the oil.\u201d. He is likely referring to al-Omar, the largest oil field in Syria, and a key SDF fortress bordering Assad-controlled territories in Deir ez-Zor.\n\n\u201cDeir ez-Zor specifically is a pure Arab area, and they suffered a lot from ISIS. They lost thousands of people. They suffered from Iranian militias, from Assad,\u201d said Barabandi, who has family ties to Deir ez-Zor. \u201cWe hope that the Americans can benefit from the dynamics on the ground, because these people are anti-ISIS, they are anti-Iran, they are local, and they are hoping to find some formula to work with the United States even after the United States leaves Syria.\u201d\n\nBut Katz emphasized to the National Interest that Arab elements of the SDF \u201clack the capability of the YPG,\u201d the Kurdish core of the SDF. In order to leave an Arab stay-behind force in Deir ez-Zor, the United States would need to \u201ctrain the trainer,\u201d using the YPG to build the capacity of Arab fighters.\n\nNow that the YPG is busy fighting Turkey\u2014and working on a deal with Assad that would likely exclude a U.S. presence\u2014U.S. forces would have to be directly involved in supporting the fighters in Deir ez-Zor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a difficult and intense train and assist mission,\u201d Katz said.\n\nU.S. forces in the area would need a \u201cland bridge\u201d of their own. While the garrison in al-Tanf is connected to Jordan, a U.S. partner, the Faysh Khabur border crossing with Iraq and the Rmeilan military airfield are the only U.S.-friendly links between Deir ez-Zor and the outside world.\n\nBoth are within the twenty-mile strip of land that Erdo\u011fan has claimed for his \u201csafe zone.\u201d Keeping a U.S. presence there requires Turkish cooperation.\n\nThe counter-Iran, pro-Turkey hawks who now have Trump\u2019s ear seem to believe such cooperation is possible.\n\n\u201cI am one of those who would have liked to have seen us leverage the position in northern Syria to become a position of power that we would use to prevent the Iranians from creating a corridor from Baghdad to Beirut,\u201d Hudson Institute fellow Michael Doran said on October 17. \u201cI think when Americans are looking at this crisis, they should say to themselves, when the dust all settles, we want the Turks working within our framework.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope we have divorced [\u00d6calan\u2019s party] the PKK,\u201d he continued, speaking at SETA, a think tank in Washington close to Turkey\u2019s ruling party.\n\nTrump retweeted a statement by Doran denouncing the PKK, and has since then repeated Doran\u2019s talking points, calling the party \u201cmore of a terrorist threat in many ways than ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeir ez-Zor is not an area that means much to Turkey,\u201d claimed Barabandi. \u201cI would not be surprised if Turkey said to the Americans, we will work with you in that part.\u201d\n\nBut even with Turkey\u2019s cooperation, the U.S. presence in southeastern Syria may not be sustainable in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe'll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money, so that they have some cash flow,\u201d Trump said at a cabinet meeting today. \u201cMaybe we'll get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really possible for us to exploit those oil resources unless we want to be oil smugglers,\u201d McGurk said. He said that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a long-time oil industry executive, had looked into helping the SDF sell Syrian oil, but could not find a legal path for American involvement without Assad\u2019s permission.\n\n\u201cThe Assad government is going to want to control oil resources, so U.S. bases that are in close proximity to oil resources will become a real geopolitical boiling point,\u201d said Center for a New American Security fellow Nicholas Heras.\n\n\u201cOver the long term, the pro-regime forces see that the U.S. wants out, and they\u2019ll be willing to take more risks,\u201d Katz added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in competition for the same kind of proxies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to counter an insurgency remotely,\u201d Katz emphasized.\n\nMatthew Petti is a national security reporter at the National Interest and a former Foreign Language Area Studies Fellow at Columbia University.
