Federal judges are being asked to block a new Trump administration policy scheduled to take effect next week that would deny legal permanent residency to many immigrants over the use of public benefits.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Federal judges in three states on Friday temporarily blocked Donald Trump's policy to deny green cards to many immigrants who use Medicaid, food stamps and other government benefits, dealing a setback to one of the president's most aggressive moves yet to cut legal immigration and make it more based on employment skills than family ties.\n\nThe rulings in California, New York and Washington came in quick succession four days before the new rules were set to take effect. The judges ruled in favor of 21 states and the District of Columbia, which challenged the policy almost immediately after it was announced in August.\n\nU.S. District Judge George Daniels in New York said the policy redefined longstanding immigration laws with a new framework that had \"no logic.\" Allowing the policy to go into effect now, he said, would have a significant impact on \"law-abiding residents who have come to this country to seek a better life.\"\n\n\"Overnight, the rule will expose individuals to economic insecurity, health instability, denial of their path to citizenship and potential deportation,\" Daniels wrote. \"It is a rule that will punish individuals for their receipt of benefits provided by our government, and discourages them from lawfully receiving available assistance intended to aid them in becoming contributing members of society.\"\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, expressed confidence that the administration would eventually prevail and framed the policy as a legal attempt to ensure that those who settle in the United States can support themselves financially.\n\n\"An objective judiciary will see that this rule lies squarely within long-held existing law,\" Cuccinelli wrote on Twitter. \"Long-standing federal law requires aliens to rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, sponsors, and private organizations in their communities to succeed.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham added that the rulings were \"extremely disappointing\" and \"the latest inexplicable example of the administration being ordered to comply with the flawed or lawless guidance of a previous administration instead of the actual laws passed by Congress.\"\n\nWhile Trump has focused much of his attention on illegal immigration \u2014 including his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border \u2014 he has also trained his sights on curbing legal immigration by moving away from a system that is largely based on family ties. He outlined his plans early in his administration in discussions with Congress to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, turning to executive actions after those efforts failed.\n\nJust last week, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that says immigrants will be barred from the country unless they are covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to pay for any medical costs. The measure, which is scheduled to take effect Nov. 3, could prohibit the entry of about 375,000 people a year, mainly family members who account for a majority of people getting green cards from abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\nFriday's rulings put the policy to deny green cards to more immigrants on government aid on hold while lawsuits proceed. Federal law already requires immigrants seeking to become permanent U.S. residents to prove they will not be a burden on the country \u2014 a \"public charge,\" in legal terms \u2014but the new rules detail a broader range of programs that could disqualify applicants.\n\nOn average, 544,000 people apply for green cards every year, with about 382,000 falling into categories that would be subject to the new review, according to the government. Guidelines in use since 1999 refer to a \"public charge\" as someone primarily dependent on cash assistance, income maintenance or government support.\n\nUnder the new rules, the Department of Homeland Security has redefined a public charge as someone who is \"more likely than not\" to receive public benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period. If someone uses two benefits, that is counted as two months. And the definition has been broadened to include Medicaid, housing assistance and food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.", "description": "A federal judge in New York on Friday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from implementing a plan to deny green cards to many immigrants who use Medicaid, food stamps and other government benefits.
