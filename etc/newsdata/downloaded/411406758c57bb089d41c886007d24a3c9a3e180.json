It remains a mix of the complex and the simple.\n\nThe industry it works in is inherently complex, a global sector underpinned by a labyrinth of local laws and rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWiseTech\u2019s key product, the CargoWise One freight-forwarding platform, is complex. White describes it as more Bloomberg than CommSec, due to the nature of the logistics sector.\n\nAnd WiseTech\u2019s business has an inherent level of complexity, having been built around 33 acquisitions, worth $400 million, over the last five years.\n\nWhite made a strong case as to why WiseTech\u2019s acquisition drive was actually less risky, cheaper and faster than trying to build out offices across a global network. Gaining the local knowledge, systems and processes required to operate inside a specific country\u2019s logistics sector would have been impossible without making this long series of relatively small deals, he argues.\n\n\u201cThere is no organics strategy \u2013 none \u2013 that would actually function in those circumstances,\u201d White told investors.\n\nNatural scepticism\n\n\u201cThe entire business is deep and powerful and complex. If you want us to be an average business, we don\u2019t do any of these things.\u201d\n\nWhite also argues the simple outputs of this complexity \u2013 high levels of recurring revenue, good organic growth, low customer attrition and strong profitability \u2013 show the model works.\n\nBut as White told Chanticleer, WiseTech is trying to do something that no one else has done in the logistics sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPioneering strategies create competitive advantage, as WiseTech\u2019s growth shows. But they also raise natural scepticism among investors.\n\nWhether you agree with JCap\u2019s approach or not \u2013 and White\u2019s revelation that the firm didn\u2019t ask WiseTech to clarify any issues before it launched its attack is not a point in JCap\u2019s favour \u2013 it is reasonable that investors would look closely at the acquisition strategy on which the WiseTech empire was built.\n\nIndeed, it was notable that White pointed to a slowdown in the pace of acquisitions in recent months, as the company beds down recent deals and refines its growth plans.\n\nWhite\u2019s final message for investors was pointed.\n\n\u201cRest assured we are going to be running this business as hard as we were before JCap and after JCap.\u201d", "description": "WiseTech's response to JCap should get it back to what all listed companies face: genuine, sensible and factual debate about business model and strategy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8745%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_975%2C$y_212/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/52e2ef197ab19b2ee04b405c35a52438bb34d95b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
