Because the golden toilet had been connected to the palace\u2019s plumbing system, police said its removal caused \u201csignificant damage and flooding\u201d to the building, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture.\n\nA 66-year-old man was arrested. The man has not been identified or charged.\n\nThames Valley Police Detective Inspector Jess Milne said: \u201cThe artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice.\u201d\n\nBlenheim Palace said in a statement that officials are \u201csaddened\u201d by the theft but \u201crelieved no one was hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe knew there was huge interest in the Maurizio Cattelan contemporary art exhibition, with many set to come and enjoy the installations,\u201d the palace said in a tweet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s therefore a great shame an item so precious has been taken, but we still have so many fascinating treasures in the Palace and the remaining items of the exhibition to share.\u201d\n\nA statement on the Palace website said the building was closed to the public Saturday because of \u201can unforeseen incident.\u201d The grounds remained open.\n\nThe Palace said normal operations will resume Sunday.\n\nPrior to the theft, visitors to the Cattelan exhibition could book a three-minute appointment to use the toilet.\n\nThe magnificent stately home is extremely popular with visitors and is occasionally used for special events including high end fashion shows and art exhibits. It is located in Oxfordshire, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of London.", "description": "Thieves have stolen a unique solid gold toilet worth up to 1 million pounds ($1.25 million) from the birthplace of British wartime leader Winston Churchill.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR311_toilet_ZG_20190914101746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
