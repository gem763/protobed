Earlier this month, regulators announced a firm timetable to fully open its futures, brokerage and mutual fund sectors to foreign investors in 2020.\n\nWong said relaxed foreign ownership rules are very important for HSBC, which, in addition to its banking business, also owns insurance, asset management and brokerage ventures in China.\n\nBut other regulations also need to be relaxed, he said, for example to allow HSBC to expand its insurance business more easily into new cities and provinces in China.\n\nAnother obstacle, Wong said, is that \"it's very difficult for foreign banks to get deposits in China\" due to very stringent requirements, so China should \"figure out a way\" to help them.\n\n\"We've been trying for a number of years. Now we're developing, we're increasing our share, but the journey is not easy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Ben Blanchard.
