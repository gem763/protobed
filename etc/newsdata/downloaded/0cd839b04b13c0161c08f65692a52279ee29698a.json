The jury is still out on that because you can train as much as you want and be as fit as you can, but until you play in a World Cup with something on the line, you do not know.\n\nIreland top rankings after Wales are worn down and suffer fly-half blow Read more\n\n\u201cThe tournament is special because it only comes around every four years, but it is still about winning games. My World Cup experience is a smorgasbord: not great in 2007, the semi\u2011final in 2011 when, on another night, we would have made the final, and while everyone talks about us beating England four years ago, we did not capitalise when Australia went down to 13 men and [we] failed to make position count against South Africa in the quarter-final.\u201d\n\nJones is the only player in the squad who has played under a Wales head coach other than Warren Gatland. The New Zealander is leaving when his side\u2019s involvement in the World Cup ends having overseen the greatest period of success since the 1970s.\n\n\u201cHis legacy is cast, but there is still a job to do,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis is potentially my last World Cup chance and we will be judged on this competition, not the last 18 months.\n\n\u201cFor the neutral, it is an open tournament in an exciting country that is going to put on one hell of a show. I am just concerned, given decisions that have been made on the field, that it is becoming increasingly difficult for referees. We will talk about the tackle laws because it is an issue. You do not want it to become a talking point that overshadows the tournament.\u201d", "description": "Alun Wyn Jones, who is getting ready for his fourth World Cup, said referees will have a tough time in Japan: \u2018We will talk about tackle laws because it is an issue\u2019", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8301c6a18bf80a771fe37b26b5c6c38a2dca2c64/173_0_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6f9fca2ddefee1dfa18d96a893bcd40d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
