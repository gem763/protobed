Thanks @polinlove ! \u2014 Harry Harris (@USAmbROK) October 19, 2019\n\nThe Korea Herald, an English-language newspaper based in Seoul, said Friday\u2019s demonstration was a surprise protest by what it characterized as a \u201cprogressive civic group\u201d of students.\n\nAD\n\nThe United States and South Korea have a burden-sharing agreement stemming from a 1953 mutual defense treaty after the halt of the Korean War. As part of the agreement, roughly 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.\n\nThe cost of maintaining an American military presence to aid in South Korea\u2019s defense against North Korea has been a point of tension in recent months, particularly after President Trump inaccurately claimed during a February Cabinet meeting that \u201cSouth Korea is costing us $5 billion a year. And they pay \u2014 they were paying about $500 million for $5 billion worth of protection.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a previous analysis by The Washington Post, South Korea\u2019s payment to the U.S. last year was around $830 million, which covered approximately 40 percent of the cost of the U.S. deployment; the total cost for the United States is closer to $1.25 billion, not the $5 billion figure Trump stated.\n\nAD\n\nU.S. military bases have a complex history in South Korea, due to politics as well as their association at times with prostitution, black markets and other vices. Yet even if hostilities were defused between North and South Korea, many South Koreans support an ongoing U.S. presence.\n\nBy the end of the year, the United States will complete the move of its largest foreign military base from Seoul, where it\u2019s been for 70 years, to the massive new Camp Humphreys facility roughly 45 miles to the south.\n\nAD\n\nIn August, Trump called for South Korea to pay more for military protection by U.S. forces. Officials from Seoul and Washington are scheduled to meet in Hawaii next week for another round of negotiations on the burden-sharing agreement.\n\nJoyce Lee contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: an earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the location of the breach as the U.S. Embassy.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Students used extension ladders to scale the walls of the secure embassy and unfurled banners demanding U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris leave the country.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/k1EHU_mZh2O-dFbl8_ZRQh4J8Qk=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-19-2019/t_d3a62e31c5be401cb9d66c0b47c85ed0_name_20191019_Seol_protests_students_still_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
