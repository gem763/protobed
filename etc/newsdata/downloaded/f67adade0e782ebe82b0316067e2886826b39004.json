It doesn\u2019t really matter on what, it\u2019s already gone. Of course, your tax money is already spent, as is that of your children and a good chunk of what your grandchildren will earn; that\u2019s what happens when you have a national debt surpassing $22 trillion. So what\u2019s a few tens of trillions more?\n\nIn the last debate, most of the candidates on the stage came out in favor of a wealth tax, under the banner of the rich needing to \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d What they never say is what a \u201cfair share\u201d is. How much of what someone earns is the government entitled to? The only answer is \u201cmore.\u201d\n\nThe thing about a wealth tax is just because someone has a high net worth, it doesn\u2019t mean they are sleeping on piles of cash they can break off a wad of to give Uncle Sam what he\u2019s demanding. Jeff Bezos is worth about $110 billion, but it\u2019s largely tied up in Amazon stock. He\u2019d have to sell a bunch of it to come up with the cash to cover his bill. Then he\u2019d have to repeat it every year to satisfy the Democratic Party\u2019s lust for cash.\n\nHowever, if you took everything he\u2019s worth you couldn\u2019t fund the government for 2 weeks. Then what would you do? You can\u2019t go back to him for more, he\u2019s broke. You\u2019d have to work your way down the list of billionaires, but there still wouldn\u2019t be enough money to cover the nearly $5 trillion the government is fast approaching as an annual budget. And that\u2019s before Democrats add their $3-plus trillion per year on health care, student loan \u201cforgiveness,\u201d \u201cfree\u201d college, and massive increases in existing subsidies.\n\nIn other words, the rich aren\u2019t rich enough to keep the promises Democrats are making.\n\nThen again, neither is the country.\n\nDoesn\u2019t make sense? That\u2019s likely because the numbers we\u2019re dealing with here have no meaning to you. No one, not even billionaires, can wrap their minds around a billion dollars, let alone a trillion. As a kid, my best friend\u2019s mother taught me a way to put it into some kind of perspective. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s better than anything else I\u2019ve learned.\n\nA million seconds is about 12 days. A billion seconds is about 32 years. If you\u2019re reading this you have lived several million seconds, and possibly more than a billion seconds. But a trillion seconds is roughly 32,000 years, significantly longer than known human history.\n\nIn addition to the nearly $5 trillion per year we\u2019re already spending, Democrats are looking to spend almost that much over again in new programs and giveaways. How do you pay for that when you can\u2019t cover what you\u2019re already spending?\n\nYou can\u2019t. Even after raising taxes on everyone, there still won\u2019t be enough to cover the tab. But the people who\u2019d vote to spend the money will be long since gone by the time the bill comes due, so they don\u2019t care.\n\nOur government has turned into a game of chicken, in which politicians spend freely hoping they\u2019ll be retired or dead by the time the economy can no longer bear the weight of deficit spending.\n\nOf course, raising taxes will only slow economic growth, making everything worse.\n\nWe\u2019re essentially in a death spiral no one wants to acknowledge.\n\nThen along comes the 849 Democrats running for president, every one of them with trillions of dollars in promises in the back pocket, and you see how much worse it could get.\n\nSo yes, Democrats are going to raise your taxes. They are going to take from you and your family to give to someone else, someone whose vote they want to buy.\n\nBut whether they get their way or not, there is no serious plan to stop the real problem of government spending. Neither party wants to address it because realism doesn\u2019t win votes.\n\nIf it sounds hopeless, that\u2019s only because it is. There is no constituency for fiscal sanity, at least not one big enough to win more than a House seat or two. So if Republicans win, it will keep getting worse, if Democrats win, it will keep getting worse faster. Until, that is, people stop looking to the government to provide them with \u201cfree\u201d things. And we all know there isn\u2019t much chance of that.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "There isn\u2019t a dollar in existence that one or more .10/22/2019 9:22:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/e97ac8d2-18a8-49df-9312-218cd6fc3114.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
