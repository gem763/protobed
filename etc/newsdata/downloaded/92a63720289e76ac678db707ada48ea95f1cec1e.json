But the defendant came up to her and heard her breathing as she lay on the floor, and he started hitting her again.\n\n\"He told her to stop struggling and relax and that he was going to kill her.\n\n\"She was determined not to lose consciousness but she did think her life was going to end.\"\n\n(Image: Teesside Live)\n\nNott only stopped the brutal beating because he was so exhausted from the effort of pummelling the defenceless victim in her living room.\n\nThen he grabbed her throat and choked her, forcing her on to her knees to do so as she slipped in and out of consciousness.\n\nHe stopped throttling her when she kicked over a table with a vase on it, making a noise.\n\nShe pleaded with him to call an ambulance because she felt she was dying.\n\nHe made the 999 call under a false name, pretending she had been attacked by an unknown man, then left.\n\nThe horrific ordeal lasted more than two-and-a-half hours at her Hartlepool home.\n\nShe staggered downstairs where paramedics found her at 7.40am, her hair soaked in blood.\n\nShe had two swollen black eyes, a broken nose, 15 cuts and numerous bruises, with wounds to her face and head leaving permanent scars.\n\nShe was in hospital for six days and later said she was too scared to return to her flat and thought she would be killed.\n\nIn her statements, she said she felt frightened and hopeless during the \"unbelievable\" and life-changing assault.\n\nShe since had to wear a wig due to her injuries, her epilepsy worsened and she struggled with anxiety, flashbacks, poor sleep and daily panic attacks.\n\nShe still pictured the savage assault, felt isolated and was scared to leave her home.\n\nShe had known Nott as a friend for 10 years, and said she only wanted to be his friend, but now never wants to see him again.\n\nHe said something about text messages during the attack, but she had no idea why he did it.\n\nWhile she was taken to hospital, Nott sent a message to one of her relatives falsely claiming he acted in self-defence.\n\nHe was arrested in bloodied clothing getting off a train in Lincoln on New Year's Eve.\n\nNott, of Hartlepool, later admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and appeared for sentence via prison video link.\n\nThe third-strike burglar also admitted breaking into an empty home under renovation in Hartlepool last November, leaving his blood on the walls.\n\nHis 54 previous offences included robbery and assaults, including a one-year jail term in 2017 for an assault echoing his most recent crime.\n\nHe grabbed another woman's throat, headbutted her and lunged at her with a mop handle until she pretended to pass out.\n\nIt did not stop him as he kicked her several times and walked away, only to return and choke her again.\n\nThe latest offences breached a suspended sentence for breaching a restraining order, where he was found asleep in a woman's home.\n\nAndrew Teate, defending, said: \"There is no rational explanation for the defendant's actions.\"\n\nHe said Nott - who was once stabbed 13 times - had dependence syndrome and had been taking large amount of diazepam.\n\nNott was also taking \"copious amounts of other drugs\" and was on a cocktail of drugs when he burgled the unoccupied house.\n\n\"This is by far and away the most serious matter that has ever brought him before the court,\" added Mr Teate.\n\n\"He's under no illusion that a lengthy custodial term will follow. He pleaded guilty at a very early opportunity.\"\n\nJudge Howard Crowson told Nott, of the assault: \"She was your host and you were her guest. She was entitled to feel safe.\n\n\"It was clearly a wholly motiveless attack. It was a ferocious attack. She thought she would die. That's hardly surprising.\n\n\"It was an attack on a very vulnerable woman asleep in her own home.\n\n\"The injuries are truly awful.\"\n\nThe judge passed a sentence totalling 14-and-a-half years, a 10-and-a-half-year prison term plus four years' extended licence.\n\nHe was given an indefinite restraining order banning him from contacting the victim or going within 50m of her or her home.\n\nDetective Sergeant Mark Hanson from Hartlepool CID said: \u201cThis sentence reflects the fact that the victim was subject to a sustained and violent attack, disturbingly begun when she was sleeping.\n\n\"Clearly this will have a lasting impact on her life. We welcome today\u2019s sentence which will mean a dangerous offender will serve a lengthy jail term.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Nott, 33, only stopped the brutal beating because he was so exhausted from the effort of pummelling the defenceless victim in her living room", "authors": ["Gareth Lightfoot", "Image", "Cleveland Police", "Teesside Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555588.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gareth-Nott.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
