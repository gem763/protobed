Until now.\n\nRBC Capital Markets has risen to the No. 10 ranking for advising on announced U.S. mergers and acquisitions this year, its highest standing ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm has 9.9 per cent market share, with 72 deals valued at about US$179 billion as of Oct. 21. Its U.S. investment banking co-head, Matthew Stopnik, anticipates more gains ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scratching the surface,\u201d Stopnik said in an interview at the firm\u2019s Lower Manhattan office. \u201cWe see an opportunity to continue to chip away and do higher quality, more meaningful transactions and build market share.\u201d\n\nRBC Capital Markets in 2010 targeted a Top 10 U.S. ranking within three years. It expanded New York operations by hiring star bankers, and boosted lending to win bigger clients. While the efforts paid off years ago in equity financings and debt deals, the Top 10 for M&A remained out of reach.\n\nThe firm has the biggest U.S. investment-banking operations of its Canadian peers including Toronto-Dominion Bank, after taking advantage of the financial crisis a decade ago to expand and recruit talent while other firms scaled back. Bank of Montreal is now aiming to take advantage of the more-recent retreat by European firms to expand its U.S. investment bank.\n\nRBC Capital Markets today has about 560 investment bankers in the U.S. \u2014 more than double from a decade earlier, and almost three times more than in Canada. That\u2019s helped the firm move up the league tables.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re gaining greater traction working on larger deals,\u201d said Stopnik, 47. \u201cA lot of it has to do with the hires and investments we\u2019ve made over the years.\u201d\n\nRBC advised Raytheon Co. this year on a US$90-billion takeover by United Technologies Corp. It also was BB&T Corp.\u2019s sole adviser on its US$27.9-billion merger with SunTrust Banks Inc. and advised Broadcom Inc. on the US$10.7-billion acquisition of Symantec Corp.\u2019s enterprise security business.\n\nThe firm was sole adviser and provided debt financing to Permira Holdings LLP for its US$2.5-billion takeover of life-sciences company Cambrex Corp., and is advising Apollo Global Management Inc and leading financing for a purchase of radio stations owned by Cox Enterprises Inc.\n\n\u201cIn a difficult fee environment overall, we\u2019ve made significant progress on the M&A side,\u201d said Jim Wolfe, RBC\u2019s other co-head of U.S. investment banking. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be up roughly 20 per cent year-over-year in terms of U.S. advisory fees.\u201d\n\nThis year isn\u2019t a one-off, according to Wolfe.\n\nSince becoming co-heads in June 2018, Wolfe and Stopnik have expanded the advisory business and leveraged-finance platform. They\u2019re pushing to build equity capital markets and gain expertise in technology and health care. They plan to add about three senior bankers to the 40-person health care group.\n\n\u201cAs we come into 2020 we\u2019ve got the best pipeline that we\u2019ve had in quite some time across all products, but particularly M&A,\u201d Wolfe, 54, said in an interview. \u201cWe feel good about the ability to keep the momentum we achieved in 2019 as it relates to our advisory business.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "RBC Capital Markets has risen to the No. 10 ranking for advising on announced U.S. mergers and acquisitions this year, its highest standing ever", "authors": ["Doug Alexander", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/rbc-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
