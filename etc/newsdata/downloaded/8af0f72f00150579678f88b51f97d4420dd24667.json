As business confidence starts to wane [...] two of the corporate expenditure lines which are traditionally sacrificed first in an effort to curb costs tend to be advertising and business travel.\n\n'The latter has clear implications for Whitbread, even within its home market, and especially in its regional presence, where business stays are an important part of its model.'\n\nWhitbread shares, which have declined by 13 per cent in the past six months, are down 0.1 per cent in early trading today at around \u00a342.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Whitbread, the FTSE-listed conglomerate behind Premier Inn hotels, said today that its profits were dented in the past six months amid  'challenging' UK trading conditions.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
