But with each uptick, and each unsettling headline, there seems to be an increasing call for caution.\n\nTD Ameritrade\u2019s Oliver Renick just joined the chorus.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s disconcerting is that it\u2019s remarkably easy to imagine a series of events that by nature should not necessarily pose great risk, but taken together could cause some major shocks to the S&P 500 due to current investor positioning,\u201d he explained in a post on LinkedIn this week.\n\nHe pointed to this SocGen chart, in which he marked up (not with a Sharpie) to show what he considers the most troubling for investors:\n\n\u201cA sharp market repricing should be the fattest swan on that diagram,\u201d Renick continued. \u201cThe greatest risk to investors, the economy, and the tenuous state of geopolitics, is the price of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.72% . That does not mean it is the most likely risk \u2014 what it means is that the ripple effect of a sizable selloff in stocks right now is monstrous.\u201d\n\nWhat could cause such a ripple?\n\nRenick painted this bearish scenario: The economy improves enough so that the Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates, investors get spooked, assets pull back in a highly-correlated march, no cash pours in from the sidelines and the bottom falls out. \u201cIf no one\u2019s there to buy because they\u2019ve already bought, hedges don\u2019t work because they\u2019re all tied to the same events, liquidity exacerbates swings and the president realizes his cow-prod is on the verge of breaking, watch out below,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNothing like that this week. The Dow was up triple digits at last check, while the S&P and Nasdaq COMP, +1.06% were also logging solid gains.", "description": "The market\u2019s been looking fairly strong lately, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying for the sixth session in a row.
