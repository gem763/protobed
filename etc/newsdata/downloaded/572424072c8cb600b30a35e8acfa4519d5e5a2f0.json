(AP) - Fabrice-Jean Picault scored and assisted on Marco Fabi\u00e1n\u2019s goal in extra time to help the Philadelphia Union beat New York 4-3 on Sunday and eliminate the Red Bulls from the playoffs.\n\nFabi\u00e1n came on in the 103rd minute and scored in the 105th when his shot from the left side deflected high off New York\u2019s Marc Rzatkowski into the net.\n\nThird-seeded Philadelphia, which earned the first MLS playoff win in franchise history, will play at No. 2 seed Atlanta in the second round Thursday night.\n\nJosh Sims blasted a right-footer from outside the top of the box to open the scoring in the sixth minute and Tim Parker\u2019s header in the 24th gave the Red Bulls a 2-0 lead. It was the 22-year-old Sims\u2019 first MLS goal.\n\nAlejandro Bedoya side-netted a first-timer in the 30th minute to cut Philadelphia\u2019s deficit in half but Tom Barlow scored in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time to make it 3-1.\n\nSergio Santos\u2019 header deflected off the crossbar and Jack Elliott headed home the rebound for Philadelphia in the 52nd minute. Picault, who came on in the 72nd, scored in the 78th to make it 3-3.\n\nKacper Przybylko, whose 15 goals this season are more than twice as many as any other Union player, did not play (foot stress reaction). Philadelphia had 62% possession and outshot the Red Bulls 32-11.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fabrice-Jean Picault scored and assisted on Marco Fabi\u00e1n's goal in extra time to help the Philadelphia Union beat New York 4-3 on Sunday and eliminate the Red Bulls from the playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
