Fruman is a real estate investor. Both, according to various media accounts, helped introduce Giuliani into top Ukrainian political circles.\n\n191002171637752\n\nThe arrests come as the Democratic-led US House of Representatives has launched an impeachment inquiry into the Republican president. The investigation concerns Trump's request in a July telephone call for Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic rival in the 2020 presidential election, and his son. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nTrump has labelled the impeachment inquiry a \"witch-hunt\" and maintained he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that favours campaign finance regulation, had urged a US government agency in a July 2018 complaint to investigate whether Parnas and Fruman had broken the law by using a shell company to disguise the source of a $325,000 donation to a pro-Trump political action committee.\n\nThe CLC later supplemented its complaint to the US Federal Election Commission to include evidence of wire transfers showing the movement of the funds.", "description": "Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman are accused of conspiring to 'funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/80d95b6e85a2479ea741129e7c7564d1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
