And they failed there, too\u2014at least, until April 2017. That marked the first time ever that a federal appellate court ruled that the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nPrior to that ruling, all 11 appellate courts that had addressed the issue had ruled that \u201csex\u201d does not mean \u201csexual orientation.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t until March 2018 that, for the first time ever, an appellate court ruled that Title VII banned discrimination based on transgender status.\n\nActivists would like to see the Supreme Court affirm these novel\u2014indeed, activist\u2014appellate court rulings, redefining the term \u201csex\u201d in the Civil Rights Act and embracing a simplistic account of \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s why it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nWhat Is Sex Discrimination?\n\nIn 1998, the Supreme Court explained in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., that Title VII requires \u201cneither asexuality nor androgyny.\u201d It requires equality and neutrality.\n\nIt does not exclude all sex-conscious standards, but it does exclude double standards for men and women\u2014policies that disfavor at least some individuals of one sex compared to similarly situated members of the other.\n\nThat was the explicit position of the unanimous court in Oncale, which quoted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: \u201cThe critical issue, Title VII\u2019s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d\n\nThe unanimous court in Oncale echoed what a plurality opinion had said several years earlier, in the 1989 case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins: that sex may not be used to create \u201cdisparate treatment of men and women.\u201d\n\nUnder Oncale and Price Waterhouse, courts applying Title VII must ask whether some women are subject to disadvantageous terms not faced by men in a similar position, or vice versa. Courts must look, in short, for unfairness due to sex. Mere consideration of sex is not enough.\n\nThis is why bans on sex discrimination didn\u2019t abolish sex-specific private facilities (like bathrooms), sex-specific fitness standards (for police and firefighters, for example), or sex-specific athletic competitions (like the NBA and WNBA).\n\nAfter all, sex-specific bathrooms, fitness standards, and sports leagues don\u2019t create disadvantageous conditions. On the contrary, they prevent disadvantageous treatment. That\u2019s because they take sex differences seriously where they make a difference, for the sake of privacy and equality.\n\nYet LGBT activists effectively urge the court to adopt a theory of sex discrimination that would rule out any policies that refer to sex, judging them to be inherently discriminatory.\n\nThat would lead to asexuality and androgyny\u2014precisely what the court has said Title VII does not require.\n\nTitle VII Does Not Simply Forbid Any Action \u2018Causally Linked\u2019 to Sex\n\nThe oral arguments this week center on whether the ban on \u201csex\u201d discrimination extends to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender status.\n\nThe only way for the lawyers arguing this position to make their case is to reject the Ginsburg reading of Title VII\u2014where it prohibits double standards for men and women\u2014and to advance a novel theory where any reference to sex constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nWhile this new approach is increasingly hailed as providing a knockdown textualist argument, it suffers from a fatal flaw.\n\nAccording to the version proposed by lawyers for the employee in the gender identity case (Stephens), \u201cany time the same decision would not have been made had the employee\u2019s sex been different, an employer discriminates \u2018because of sex.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, law professors Andy Koppelman and Bill Eskridge, amici on the side of the employees, propose that \u201can employer violates the law if it (1) takes negative employment action (2) that is causally linked to (3) the sex of the employee.\u201d\n\nThis theory fails, because not every employment policy \u201ccausally linked\u201d to sex imposes a disadvantage on individuals of one sex compared to similarly situated members of the other sex.\n\nSo the theory doesn\u2019t isolate sex discrimination. It flouts the Ginsburg reading\u2014on which Title VII forbids only double standards for the sexes. Contrary to Oncale, it requires asexuality and androgyny.\n\nTo see why, let\u2019s look at what embracing this theory would require.\n\nSuppose a male employee at a fitness center repeatedly goes into the women\u2019s locker room and is fired. Had his \u201csex been different\u201d he would not have been fired. In that sense, his termination was \u201ccausally linked\u201d to his sex.\n\nBut the termination was not sex discrimination, because it reflected no double standard for men and women. Female employees who went into the men\u2019s locker room would be fired too. The employer was simply enforcing a locker room policy that imposed the same \u201cburden\u201d on men and women: restriction to one specific locker room, based on sex.\n\nOr suppose a female lifeguard is fired because she wears swimsuit bottoms but refuses to wear tops. Had her \u201csex been different,\u201d she would not have been fired.\n\nThe decision to fire her was \u201ccausally linked\u201d to her sex. Yet her termination was not sex discrimination under Title VII, because a male lifeguard who exposed his private parts would have similarly been fired.\n\nThe attire policy did not create a disadvantage for women that it did not impose on men: Both are required to dress in ways that cover private parts.\n\nThe test put forth by the LGBT advocates is too simplistic. It does not test for sex-based discrimination. In both of the above examples, the employees were fired because they violated policies that do not disadvantage women compared to analogous men, or vice versa.\n\nFar from being an instance of sex discrimination, preventing males from entering women-only private facilities is actually required to avoid sex discrimination.\n\nGinsburg took this point for granted in her majority opinion in United States v. Virginia, when she explained that, for the all-male Virginia Military Institute to become co-ed, it \u201cwould undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.\u201d\n\nMoreover, in 1975, when critics argued that the Equal Rights Amendment would require unisex intimate facilities, then-professor Ginsburg explained that a ban on sex discrimination would not require such an outcome: \u201cSeparate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy.\u201d\n\nSo it isn\u2019t sex discrimination to act in a way \u201ccausally linked\u201d to sex when sex is a relevant factor and you don\u2019t disadvantage individuals of one sex compared to similarly situated members of the other sex. By contrast, an employer who allowed males to enter private women-only facilities would be guilty of sex discrimination under Title VII, because doing so would foster a hostile work environment.\n\nYet the activists would hold such an employer guilty if he prevented males from entering. Their theory requires asexuality and androgyny, but Title VII does not\u2014it forbids double standards and protects sensible workplace privacy policies.\n\nDouble Standards Based on Sex Are at the Heart of Sex Discrimination\n\nThe simplistic account of discrimination is easy to see when you look at concrete examples. Lawyers for Stephens, the employee in the gender identity case, claim:\n\nMuch as Ms. Phillips [the employee in a 1971 Title VII case, Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp.] was discriminated against for being a woman and for having young children, so Ms. Stephens was fired for having a male sex assigned at birth and for living openly as a woman. That is sex discrimination.\n\nBut this assertion ignores the actual structure of the discrimination in Phillips.\n\nPhillips was discriminated against on the basis of sex because men with young children were not held to the same terms as women with young children. Had both men and women been held to the same standard, there would have been no disparate impact on men and women and hence no double standard.\n\nNor is there any double standard here. Both males and females who refused to abide by the dress code would be treated in the same way.\n\nThe same is true in the sexual orientation cases. Yet lawyers for one of the employees there (Zarda) argue:\n\nHad Martin Marietta articulated its policy as a refusal to hire \u201cmothers,\u201d rather than not hiring \u201cwomen with young children,\u201d the result would have been the same. Phillips\u2019s sex (plus her parental status) is why she did not get the job. \u2026 The same logic applies to Zarda. Were he not a man, he would not have been fired for his attraction to men. Conversely, persons who shared his attraction to men but not his sex (i.e., \u201cheterosexual women\u201d) were not denied job opportunities. Saying he was fired for being \u201cgay\u201d does not change the analysis. Thus, Zarda has properly alleged discrimination \u201cbecause of [his] sex.\u201d\n\nBut the reason Martin Marietta was guilty of discrimination based on sex was not that it used certain magical words (\u201cwomen with young children,\u201d rather than \u201cmothers\u201d), but that it went easier on \u201cmen with young children\u201d and \u201cfathers.\u201d\n\nIf it had had an evenhanded policy regarding all \u201cpeople with young children\u201d and \u201cparents,\u201d there would have been no sex discrimination. So, too, an evenhanded policy against same-sex relationships does not discriminate on the basis of sex.\n\nThe lawyers obscure this dispositive point by picking the wrong comparator. Comparing Zarda to \u201cpersons who shared his attraction to men but not his sex (i.e., \u2018heterosexual women\u2019)\u201d changes two factors\u2014sex and sexual orientation\u2014and so fails to ferret out the basis for the employment decision.\n\nComparing a homosexual man to a heterosexual woman will not tell us whether the employment decision was driven by sex or by sexual orientation. In determining the basis of an employment decision, we should hold orientation constant and vary just the employee\u2019s sex: the question is whether men and women attracted to their own sex are treated differently from each other.\n\nStephens\u2019 argument, too, changes two factors\u2014sex and transgender status. Stephens argues that Harris Homes \u201cwould not have fired Ms. Stephens for identifying and living openly as a woman if she were assigned a female sex at birth.\u201d\n\nWell, yes, Harris Homes would not fire a woman who followed the women\u2019s dress code. But that\u2019s not an apt comparison to Stephens\u2014a man who sought to follow the women\u2019s dress code.\n\nComparing Stephens to a cisgender woman changes two factors\u2014sex and transgender status\u2014and thus fails to hold constant all factors but sex.\n\nThe proper comparison would be a woman who sought to dress according to the men\u2019s dress code. That way both employees identify as transgender, and all that is changed is their sex.\n\nComparing a transgender male to a cisgender female will not tell us whether the employment decision was driven by sex or by transgender status. The question is whether men and women who identify as the opposite sex are treated differently from each other.\n\nHarris Homes reports it would dismiss a female employee who sought to abide by the male dress code. In other words, there\u2019s no double standard for men and women, so there\u2019s no discrimination on the basis of sex. Both males and females who identify as transgender are held to the same standard.\n\n3 Different Forms of Discrimination\n\nImagine an employer who won\u2019t employ women but will employ men, or who won\u2019t employ women with kids but will employ men with kids.\n\nThis would be discrimination on the basis of sex, because \u201cmembers of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\u201d It\u2019s a double standard for men and women.\n\nBy contrast, consider an employer who will hire straight men and women, but not men and women who identify as gay. Men and women are exposed to the same exact terms and conditions, so this wouldn\u2019t be discrimination based on sex. The employment action doesn\u2019t hinge on male or female, but on gay or straight.\n\nAnd lastly, consider an employer who will hire cisgender men and women, but not transgender men and women. Here, too, men and women are exposed to the same exact terms and conditions, so this wouldn\u2019t be discrimination based on sex. The employment action here isn\u2019t concerned fundamentally with male or female, but with cisgender or transgender.\n\nNow, whatever you may think about these three cases as a matter of ethics or public policy, Congress acted in 1964 to address only the first case\u2014and it has explicitly rejected policies to address the latter two.\n\nPeople can debate whether that is or is not a good thing. But, as a legal matter, the issue is clear. Discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited, but discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is not.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s good reason why Congress has rejected calls to legally prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d on the basis of \u201csexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d Much of what the activists claim is \u201cdiscrimination\u201d is simply disagreement about human sexuality, where acting based on true beliefs about human sexuality is re-described as discriminatory.\n\nRedefining Sex and Embracing a Simplistic Account of Discrimination Will Have Drastic Consequences\n\nIf the Supreme Court were to adopt the activists\u2019 theory, it would not simply distort the statutory text but would also cause serious practical harms\u2014and unsurprisingly so.\n\nAfter all, the court would be rewriting the law Congress passed\u2014but with no opportunity for legislators to add to the definitions, qualifications, and limits they might have included if they had actually decided to address sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nFor instance, the activists\u2019 position would either require the elimination of all sex-specific programs and facilities or allow access based on an individual\u2019s subjective identity rather than his or her objective biology.\n\nIt is telling that the activists are evasive about which of these outcomes is required by their theory. Making the theory\u2019s implications explicit would prove decisively that their reading is unsound.\n\nIt would also highlight the severe consequences for privacy, safety, and equality. Employers would be prevented from protecting their employees\u2019 privacy and would be exposed to ruinous liability. They would have to cover objectionable medical treatments. Physicians would have to perform them against conscience.\n\nAnd the consequences would not be limited to the employment context. If this new theory of sex and of discrimination is imposed on Title VII, then why not Title IX? Yet an activist reading of sex discrimination would spell the end of girls\u2019 and women\u2019s athletics, and of private facilities at school.\n\nIn short, activists ask the court to rewrite our nation\u2019s civil rights laws in a way that would directly undermine one of their main purposes: protecting the equal rights of girls and women.\n\nCongress did not legislate such an outcome, and the court should not usurp Congress\u2019 authority by imposing such an extreme policy on the nation.\n\nBiology is not bigotry, and the court should not conclude otherwise. Only Congress, not the court, can craft policy to address sexual orientation and gender identity\u2014distinct concepts from sex\u2014with attention to all the competing considerations.", "description": "This week, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in cases that ask whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans employment discrimination on the basis of sex, extends to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender status.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd legal argument, given that\u00a0the public meaning of the word \u201csex\u201d in 1964\u2014and today, for that matter\u2014refers to our status as male or female, not our sexual attractions, desires, actions, or identity.", "authors": ["Ryan Anderson", "Senior Research Fellow In American Principles", "Public Policy", "Ryan T.
