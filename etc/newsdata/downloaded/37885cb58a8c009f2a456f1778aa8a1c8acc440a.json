REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nThere was a standoff as dusk began to fall in the Chinese-ruled city, with pro-democracy protesters and bemused tourists gathered on the pavements of the shopping and hotel artery of Nathan Road, which police had earlier cleared in slow-moving cordons.\n\nRiot police stood by outside the Chungking Mansions high-rise warren of South Asian restaurants and backpacker hostels, shields and batons at the ready. Protesters shouted obscenities in colorful Cantonese at \u201cblack police\u201d, referring to perceived over-use of force.\n\n\u201cFight for Hong Kong!\u201d protesters shouted, \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d, a reference to demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police actions, among other things.\n\nPolice later moved away, leaving protesters, pedestrians and tourists alike to take over the street under the neon lights. Then one water cannon moved in, firing high into the air and down side-streets.\n\nThe number of protesters had grown by the minute earlier in the afternoon, streaming down Nathan Road to the water\u2019s edge, in front of the dramatic backdrop of Hong Kong island, but many fled after the tear gas and pepper spray were fired.\n\nAmbulances took one man away on a stretcher. The need for treatment was not immediately clear.\n\nPolice detained some protesters as they gathered, many yelling profanities while police used loud-hailers to warn others away. The crowds at the waterfront had largely dispersed after a couple of hours and headed north up Nathan Road, where many luxury brand shops closed their shutters.\n\nThe rallying cry of the protesters was also for the protection of \u201cMuslims, journalists and the people\u201d.\n\nA police water cannon fired bursts of blue-dyed water at a small group of people outside a Nathan Road mosque during protests last weekend, drawing criticism from some in the Muslim community.

They are disturbing the Hong Kong people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what for? What authority do they have to do that?

Police have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds, wounding several protesters and a few journalists.\n\nPolice deny accusations of brutality, saying they have shown restraint in life-threatening situations. There had been a week-long lull in clashes.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they view as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling.
