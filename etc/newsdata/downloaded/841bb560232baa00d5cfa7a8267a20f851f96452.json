As The New York Times reported, after Trump recalled the U.S. ambassador, Lutsenko gloated to the head of AntAC that he had \u201celiminated your roof,\u201d using Russian mafia slang for guardian.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been exporting our corruption to them, rather than trying to export good governance,\u201d said Fukuyama.\n\nWhen he said that, Fukuyama may not have known how right he was. A few hours after I met Leshchenko, news broke that two Ukrainian-born clients of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had been arrested on charges of campaign finance crimes as they were preparing to leave the United States with one-way tickets.\n\nAccording to an indictment, the two \u201csought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.\u201d (In one of those preposterously on-the-nose details that make the Trump era feel like a computer simulation on the fritz, Parnas had a company called Fraud Guarantee.)\n\nAs soon as news of the indictment broke, I messaged Leshchenko, who guessed that the unnamed Ukrainian official was Lutsenko. It was a natural assumption; it had already been reported that Parnas and Fruman connected Giuliani with Lutsenko, who had been feeding Trump\u2019s lawyer conspiracy theories about the journalist, the former American ambassador and Joe Biden.\n\nSure enough, on Saturday NBC News reported that Lutsenko was the official in the indictment. Yovanovitch might have been referring to Lutsenko when she said, in her Friday congressional testimony, that \u201cindividuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThanks to Giuliani\u2019s escapades, the domestic grudges of a crooked Ukrainian prosecutor have blossomed into a scandal that\u2019s likely to lead to the impeachment of an American president. Federal prosecutors are now investigating whether Giuliani himself broke the law.", "description": "Once upon a time, we spread ideals of democracy and rule of law. Now?
