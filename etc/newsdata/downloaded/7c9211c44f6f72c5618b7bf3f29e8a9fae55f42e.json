In October 2017, mayors in the central Creuse region turned Macron\u2019s picture round so that he faced the wall, in protest at cuts to local government budgets and job losses.\n\nThe first trial over the thefts of presidential portraits took place at the end of May in the eastern town of Bourg-en-Bresse.\n\nAn environmental campaigner was fined \u20ac250 (\u00a3222) and five others received suspended fines.", "description": "Official portraits of French president stolen from public buildings by protesters", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40e5b7c4a78e109c5bc1835ebd96ef45317dcbc2/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5919be22c669975c3253036a12ff3242", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
