The film, set to be released Dec. 9 suggests the two were killed by Glen Rogers and not O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted of the murders in 1995 but deemed liable for both of them two years later (awarding the families $33.5 million). Rogers, a well-known serial killer dubbed \u201cCasanova Killer\u201d and \u201cCross Country Killer,\u201d was arrested one year after Brown Simpson\u2019s death for two unrelated murders.\n\nThe premise of the film stems from a highly controversial 2012 TV documentary titled My Brother the Serial Killer in which Rogers\u2019s brother, Clay, claims that he confessed to killing Brown Simpson and Goldman. Clay said his brother told him he was hired by Brown Simpson to work on her home in 1994. While he initially bragged about \u201cpartying\u201d with Brown Simpson, he says he went on to make threats about hurting her.\n\nThe 2012 documentary received pushback from many, including the Los Angeles Police Department, who told CNN at the time that they were \u201cquite confident\u201d that they know who killed Brown Simpson and Goldman and have \u201cno reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved.\u201d They added that they would look into the validity of the claims, but no arrests have been made since.\n\nWhile Yahoo Entertainment has not heard back from reps for the Brown or Goldman families about this new film, when the documentary came out seven years ago it was slammed by the Goldmans. Fred Goldman told CNN at the time, \"The overwhelming evidence at the criminal trial proved that one, and only one, person murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. That person is O.J. Simpson and not Glen Rogers.\u201d Goldman\u2019s sister Kim, who is the voice behind the Confronting: O.J. Simpson podcast, was similarly dismissive saying, \u201cI am appalled at the level of irresponsibility demonstrated by the network and producers of this so-called documentary.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of evidence supporting it, the film claims to tell the story from Brown Simpson\u2019s point of view, as Mena Suvari (playing Brown Simpson) opens the trailer with the line: \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking but it wasn\u2019t O.J.\u201d Suvari continues talking about hiring Rogers (played by Nick Stahl) to do housework on her condo \u2014 and then says that they had an intimate relationship that eventually turned dangerous. Various scenes depict Brown Simpson being intimate with the serial killer but then ultimately trying to escape him. The double-murder is also recreated for the film.\n\nBrown Simpson\u2019s friends Kris Jenner and Faye Resnick are both portrayed in the movie by Agnes Bruckner and Taryn Manning, respectively. In one scene, Brown Simpson and Resnick seemingly have a sexual relationship.\n\nSimpson is played by actor Gene Freeman, who has appeared in Power and Chernobyl: Zone of Exclusion.\n\nView photos Agnes Bruckner and Mena Suvari as Kris Jenner and Nicole Brown Simpson in The Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.

More than one person has asked, \u201cDid O.J. write this script?\u201d Another wanted to know if the 72-year-old former football star funded it.\n\nDid OJ write this script? \u2014 Isaac Olson (@isaacthegrreat) October 17, 2019\n\ncannot believe this is REAL pic.twitter.com/BbFcZRCSv8 \u2014 brendan mcgowan (@brendanjmcgowan) October 17, 2019\n\nPlease boycott this ridiculous and disrespectful POS !\n\n\n\nMena Suvari Plays Nicole Brown Simpson in New Film About Her Murder \u2014 But with a Strange Twist https://t.co/jG45VWEmUY via @people \u2014 Nikki Hamm.
