For further background on the fund ratings, see the appendix at the end of this article.\n\nOn balance, the three ratings systems have performed pretty well. The star rating appears to point investors toward funds that are more likely to survive and outperform, and away from those likelier to fail. The Analyst Rating and Quantitative Rating look to sort funds effectively based on future risk-adjusted returns, though that's less evident by some other measures.", "description": "The ratings have performed pretty well, but there are opportunities for improvement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt9ffcf2cb4f14980f/5cd438a108e4032f59d1a9e0/JeffreyPtak_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-18"}
