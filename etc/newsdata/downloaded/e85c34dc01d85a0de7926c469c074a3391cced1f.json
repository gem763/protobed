Mitt Romney says he\u2019s open to removing President Donald Trump from office, but is trying to stay as impartial as he can until he hears all the evidence.\n\n\u201cWe certainly can\u2019t have presidents asking foreign countries to provide something of political value. That is, after all, against the law.\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney\n\nIn an interview airing Sunday night on \u201cAxios on HBO,\u201d the Utah Republican said \u201cit was shocking\u201d for the president to ask Ukraine and China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nRomney is among the most outspoken Republican lawmakers willing to publicly criticize Trump, though he said many share his concerns but are too afraid of voter backlash if they speak out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no upside in going on out and attacking the leader of your party, \u2019cause that\u2019s just gonna let someone come in and primary you on the right. So people want to hang onto their job,\u201d he told Axios. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t want to do something which makes it more likely for Elizabeth Warren to become president or for us to lose the Senate.\u201d\n\nRomney criticized Trump\u2019s sense of honor and said he most disagrees with how, on divisive issues, the president appears to appeal to racism and misogyny. \u201cThose are the kinds of things I think that have been most, most harmful long term to the foundation of America\u2019s virtuous character,\u201d he said.\n\nRomney said that if impeachment went before the Senate, it would have a high bar to pass and the evidence would need to be compelling, noting that past presidents have done unethical or possibly illegal things and not been removed from office. \u201cI\u2019d like to learn the full background of who all was involved in communications with Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to get as much information as we can, make an assessment consistent with the law and the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn a separate profile published Sunday by The Atlantic, Romney was described as preparing for an impeachment. \u201cRomney is taking the prospect of a Senate trial seriously \u2014 he\u2019s reviewing \u2018The Federalist Papers,\u2019 brushing up on parliamentary procedure, and staying open to the idea that the president may need to be evicted from the Oval Office,\u201d The Atlantic\u2018s McKay Coppins wrote.\n\n\u201cI do think people will view this as an inflection point in American history,\u201d Romney told The Atlantic. \u201cAt this stage, I am strenuously avoiding trying to make any judgment.\u201d", "description": "Sen.
