That's what we're aiming towards, not a congestion tax.'", "description": "In a new scheme proposed by the Grattan Institute, drivers commuting through Sydney and Melbourne's CBDs could be slugged with a $10 fee.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/01/19972400-0-image-a-5_1571618499128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
