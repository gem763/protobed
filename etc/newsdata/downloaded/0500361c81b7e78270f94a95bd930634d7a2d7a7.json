Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) made remarks in the Democratic debate Tuesday night that harked back to President Obama\u2019s \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d line, which became fodder for Republican attacks in the 2012 presidential election.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d Warren said at the debate, arguing for higher taxes on the ultra-wealthy. \u201cMy problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you, but you built that fortune in America, I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us help pay to educate.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s debate argument was the latest iteration of a line she pioneered during her 2012 campaign for a Massachusetts Senate seat.

Somebody else made that happen.\u201d\n\nObama rival Mitt Romney soon brought up the \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d line in a speech, claiming that it was akin to saying that \u201cSteve Jobs didn't build Apple.\u201d", "description": "The former president was hounded in 2012 for saying, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that.
