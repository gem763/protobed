It includes its own Dutch cabinet doll's house which is on a tiny 1:144 scale\n\nThe National Trust enthusiast has spent over 30 years building his own miniature stately home with every feature having been inspired by actual historic properties. Pictured: Jon peeks through the main door into the entrance hall\n\nHe decided that during his lifetime he wanted to build an entire castle in the style of a National Trust property.\n\nSo far the professional actor has built eight rooms as part of the project which he has named Hordle Castle.\n\nIt boasts a stunning Turkish bathroom, a wine cellar, a chapel, a great hall, entrance hall, staircase, an attic room, escape tunnel and its very own set of battlements.\n\nEach and every feature of it has been inspired by a room or item from an actual historic properties and Jon says that he has spent thousands of hours intricately crafting his creations.\n\nJon created each item by hand using only recycled materials or existing furniture from dolls' houses. Pictured: The great hall is crammed full of 'artifacts' from across the globe including Egypt and China\n\nThe model also boasts an elaborate Turkish bathroom complete with intricate tiling and a hunting trophy rug of a tiger sprawled across the floor\n\nThe castle has its own well stocked wine and beer cellar which has hoards of dust-covered bottles and kegs\n\nThe castle's attic room is inspired by the nursery at Kingston Lacy in Dorset and its staircase, which took over a year to complete, is based on that in the Jacobean manor Hatfield House in Hertfordshire.\n\nJon has not always seen these features in person, however, and will instead often loosely base his additions off of book illustrations or online photographs.\n\nThe 42-year-old believes that has at least a dozen more rooms to complete and even wants to install miniature visitor signs, ropes and a cafe.\n\nHe believes that it could take him the rest of his life to finish as it is only around one third done at the moment.\n\nJon said: 'My friends think I'm mad and to be honest I think I'm a bit bonkers too.\n\n'Getting into miniatures was kind of inevitable, my dad was into model railways and my mum was into dolls' houses.\n\n'As a kid they always took me to National Trust properties.\n\n'Growing up I thought I would always want my own stately home and I thought working as an actor I probably wouldn't be able to afford one so I thought why not build one myself.\n\n'The idea kind of began from there.\n\n'Even when I was young I used to pick up scraps of paper and plot how I'd design the castle.'\n\nJon spent hundreds of hours drawing out stunning stained glass windows for the castle's chapel using only a sharpie and a few sheets of transparent plastic sheeting\n\nHe crafted the highly detailed fireplace in the entrance hall from an old cereal packet before he adorned it with a range of colourful coats of arms\n\nThe castle also comes with its very own chapel complete with an altar and a bible. He decorated the outside of the chapel roof with foliage which he made from scratch by cutting each individual leaf detail out of card\n\nJon says that he hopes to one day write a guide book to the castle in the style of a conventional stately home.\n\nEach of the minute features he has installed so far have been made by hand which means that the rooms have often taken years to complete.\n\nJon relies on using recycled materials from old cereal packets to egg boxes, which his neighbours often donate, to make the different parts of his beloved castle.\n\nHe also collects small items of doll's house furniture to add to the model which is where most of the cost for the project comes from.\n\nFor example, in the attic room he has a Dutch cabinet doll's house, which is on a 1:144 scale, and paid \u00a3300 for it because it was too intricate for him to make himself.\n\nJon said he has never kept a record or receipts of the whole cost of the project but estimates that it is around \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000.\n\nThe main staircase in the project took over a year to complete using seven layers of card. It is based on the staircase in the Jacobean manor Hatfield House in Hertfordshire\n\nHidden away underneath the staircase are the crowns and sceptres of monarchs resting on red and gold-detailed cushions which were also fashioned by Jon out of recycled materials\n\nThe intricate columns found throughout the castle were crafted from cardboard before being painted grey with yellow flecks to create a weathered stone effect\n\nJon said: 'I've worked on it whenever I've been able to.\n\n'It's tough to pinpoint my favourite part of the castle because each feature is taken from my favourite parts of real country houses so it's full of pleasure for me.\n\n'I think the joy of the project is that I can make everything in the way I like.'\n\nJon estimates that if he ever finishes Hordle it will span four feet square and three feet high.\n\nHe said: 'It's taken most of my life to complete.\n\n'It all began with the great hall when I was a boy. My dad cut the frames out in plywood and I built it from there.\n\n'I went to dolls house fairs and collected items over time.\n\n'When I was at university the hall just lay in my brother's shed pretty much unloved.\n\n'I did bits and pieces on it but it all changed eleven years ago when I moved into my current flat. At last I had some space!\n\nThe professional actor is proud of his achievements so far but believes that he has at least a dozen more rooms to complete. He even wants to install miniature visitor signs, ropes and a cafe\n\nJon believes that it could take him the rest of his life to complete but hopes that when it is finished it will span four feet square and three feet high. Pictured: The view from the entrance hall into the great hall\n\n'A lot of the model had become damp so I had to put the paint on again across most of it. I thought the best way to make it damp proof was to put a roof over it.\n\n'Miniaturists say nothing is ever finished.\n\n'In the pipeline I have the designs for the rest of the castle which is another ten rooms at least so I just hope I live long enough to complete it.\n\n'I also need to do the walls and the exteriors. That could take me a few years at least.\n\n'There'll be a library, a kitchen and a billiard room.\n\n'My dream is that I'll be able to leave the castle to the National Trust when I die. Hopefully it might even be complete.'", "description": "Jon Trenchard, from Forest Hill, South London,  has so far created eight rooms for the project which he has named Hordle Castle, including a great hall and a wine cellar.", "authors": ["Raven Saunt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/19834106-0-image-a-2_1571311916303.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
