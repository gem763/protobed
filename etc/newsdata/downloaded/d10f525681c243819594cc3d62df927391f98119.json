Have all the athletes been investigated who have been training in this centre? Does the report address the whole period of the existence of this project or only part of it? Could any Olympic results directly or indirectly be affected?\n\n\u201cWe learned from the report that the athletes would not have known what happened to them \u2013 this is an important factor when looking at sanctions but disqualification is mandatory whether the athlete knows or not.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Wada said it could not comment publicly until it had reviewed the case in full. Salazar has said he will appeal against the judgment. This week Farah, who has never failed a drugs test, said he had \u201cno tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile Coe has vowed to clamp down on athletes using prescription medicines for performance enhancement in the wake of Usada\u2019s investigation into Salazar \u2013 including the use of asthma and thyroid medication. The use of such medication is not illegal under the World Anti-Doping Code, but many in the sport believe using drugs such as thyroxin is unethical because it could damage an athlete\u2019s health.\n\nOn Wednesday one leading coach asked UK Athletics to set up an inquiry into whether Salazar\u2019s methods were ever used by British coaches and athletes. Coe admitted the issue was also a concern for him.\n\n\u201cWe are looking into this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that medical conditions are genuine \u2013 and that prescription-only drugs are not aiding human performance. However when it comes to therapeutic use exemptions, they have already been tightened up dramatically since when I first came on to the IAAF\u2019s council. I think we were in the thousands for TUEs. Now it is literally a handful in real terms. So we\u2019re much tougher about that sort of stuff.\u201d\n\nCoe was also asked about comments made by the US 1500m legend Jenny Simpson, who said on Wednesday that a \u201cblack cloud\u201d had hung over Salazar\u2019s training group.\n\nAlberto Salazar\u2019s ban leaves Mo Farah and UK Athletics with questions to answer | Sean Ingle Read more\n\n\u201cJenny\u2019s a very thoughtful athlete,\u201d said Coe. The only point I would make is that if athletes feel that they\u2019ve got something to tell us, they really must. Because they are the prime source of intelligence.\u201d\n\nCoe also denied taking a swipe at the BBC and its presenter Gabby Logan, who was seen laughing when the pundit Michael Johnson told her off camera that the IAAF president was \u201cfull of shit\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe BBC is a great broadcaster,\u201d Coe said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a fabulous history with our sport. I just made an observation about the comparison between what is easily concluded in a studio over a few days, and the bigger picture that I have to be thinking about.\u201d", "description": "The IOC president, Thomas Bach, has asked the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate all athletes coached by Alberto Salazar", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db71f88beddc559fce310b4855cb354bdaa23bb/0_197_3774_2264/master/3774.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=10ac0647807a876e8d9b01de66aa1dae", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
