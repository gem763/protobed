It\u2019s one thing to try and go at defenders quickly and try to break quickly.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s another thing to do it in some sort of\u2026 it\u2019s like manic the way they do it.\n\n\u201cIf they can just slow it down a little bit, take a little bit more time and think about it a little more then I think the goals will start coming more for those two, if they do that.\u201d\n\nJoel Matip Virgil van Dijk Liverpool 2019-20\n\nNicol has also admitted to seeing Joel Matip as a \u201cflaw\u201d in Liverpool\u2019s system, but concedes that the Cameroonian has impressed alongside Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe Scot added: \u201cThat [understanding with Van Dijk] comes with time.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve, not just the start of the season but the end of last season, spent a lot of time playing together.\n\n\u201cAgain, Matip, I think if there was a flaw in the back it would be around the Matip area, but the last couple of weeks he\u2019s been fantastic.\n\n\u201cSo yeah at the back that\u2019s a real good partnership right now.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nVan Dijk and Matip helped Liverpool to another clean sheet in their latest outing, with a fortuitous goal from Georginio Wijnaldum seeing Klopp\u2019s side dig out a 1-0 win at Sheffield United.\n\n\u201cIt shows a strength,\u201d Nicol said of that success at Bramall Lane, which was a 16th successive Premier League victory for the Reds.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks, Chelsea last weekend and Sheffield United this weekend, they haven\u2019t been at their best.\n\n\u201cBut do you know what, sometimes you\u2019ve got to dig it out and dig the result out and that\u2019s what pretty much they\u2019ve ended up doing both weekends.\n\n\u201cIf you can win a game by a street and score loads of goals and play silky soccer, then that\u2019s fantastic. But sometimes you\u2019ve got to fight it and tough it out, and they did it.\u201d", "description": "Ex-Reds defender Steve Nicol believes the man calling the shots at Anfield needs to find a way of getting two forwards to slow down in the final third", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Rd4fddtAuSro_3Co.SnVhg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IbVo_7izV8QNz1Be_1RmXQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/c418bb58d62ec8427891eb281e202d95", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
