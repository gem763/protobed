The most talked-about dishes at USA TODAY and IndyStar's Wine & Food Experience", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Wagyu steak, baby lamb chops, dumplings, pie and more were served with fine wine at the IndyStar Wine & Food Experience at Clay Terrace in Carmel. Michelle Pemberton, michelle.pemberton@indystar.com\n\nMore USA Today Wine & Food Experiences are coming this fall to Cincinnati, Louisville and Chicago\n\nCARMEL, Indiana \u2013 I can still hear the sizzle of lamb chops on the griddle. Their aroma was a magnet at the USA TODAY and IndyStar Wine & Food Experience Saturday. Fans lined up for a taste as quickly as Tony's steakhouse chefs pulled the chops off the griddle and laid them over ratatouille.\n\nEveryone was talking about those lamb chops, until they tried the Australian Wagyu tomahawk rib-eye Hyde Park Prime chefs were slicing a few tents away. Then it was a hit, until people dug into spicy peanut sauce on duck at Oakley's Bistro or the cheese popcorn bisque at Just Pop In! popcorn cafe. And the salmon-packed dumplings with smoked shoyu at Late Harvest Kitchen.\n\nLamb chops over ratatouille were one of the most popular dishes at the 2019 IndyStar Wine & Food Experience Sept. 28 at Clay Terrace in Carmel.

Hardly anyone one could resist the crab cake sliders on the menu at Anthony's Chophouse.\n\nI think I'm safe to say none of the 1,000 people who attended the IndyStar Wine and Food Experience at Clay Terrace in Carmel went home hungry or thirsty. More than 30 restaurants and food and drink purveyors served generous samples, including fine wines, local beer and lattes made with coffee roasted in Indianapolis. There was even dairy-free chocolate.\n\nBetween noshing on shrimp ceviche at Blue Sushi Sake Grill and velvety chocolate mousse at Gallery Pastry Shop, crowds hit cooking demonstrations by Food Network star chef Alex Guarnaschelli and local chefs Ryan Nelson of Late Harvest Kitchen and Steven Oakley of Oakley's Kitchen.\n\nIndianapolis chefs gather with Food Network star chef Alex Guarnaschelli at the 2019 IndyStar Wine & Food Experience Sept. 28 at Clay Terrace in Carmel.

She dished up fun facts like how she first turned down the offer to appear on the show \"Chopped.\"\n\n\"I just didn't think it would be that good,\" she said, rolling her eyes to lots of laughs.\n\nFood Network chef Alex Guarnaschelli prepares a corn salad during a cooking class at the 2019 IndyStar Wine & Food Experience Sept. 28 at Clay Terrace in Carmel.

The Bella twins talked about how they went from professional wrestlers to E! reality stars on the show \"Total Bellas\" and now winemakers whose highly rated Bella Radici vintages are selling quickly.\n\nBrie and Nikki Bella of the E! reality show \"Total Bellas\" talk about their Bella Radici wines at the 2019 IndyStar Wine & Food Experience Sept. 28 at Clay Terrace in Carmel. (Photo: Liz Biro/IndyStar)\n\n\"I used to be made fun of so much by everyone at WWE and all my friends because I was that girl who would go to a dive bar and be like, 'So what kind of wine do you have?' \" Nikki Bella said. \"I'd drink my Two Buck Chucks and be so proud.\"\n\nHer sister, Brie, chuckled. \"Yeah, a lot of boxed wine there.\"\n\nIf you missed the IndyStar Wine & Food Experience, don\u2019t worry. The all-you-can-eat festival is part of the USA Today Wine and Food event series, which has upcoming dates worth the drive from Indianapolis.\n\nShoefly Public House served currywurst meatballs in zero-waste edible cups at the 2019 IndyStar Wine & Food Experience Sept. 28 at Clay Terrace in Carmel.

Conant and Antoni Porowski, food and wine connoisseur of the Netflix series \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d join the Bellas in Chicago Nov. 15. The series also has upcoming dates in Las Vegas and Naples, Fla.\n\nVisit wineandfood.usatoday.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food-dining/2019/09/29/best-food-drinks-usa-today-indystar-wine-food-experience/3813680002/", "description": "If you thought the IndyStar eats sound great, there are more USA TODAY Wine & Food Experiences this fall in Cincinnati, Louisville and Chicago.", "authors": ["Liz Biro", "Published P.M.
