Ordinarily we'd be proud of our possession stats and build-up play in this tournament but we have to convert this possession into goals.\n\nThree Lions manager Roy Hodgson is under pressure to get his selection right against Iceland\n\nEngland (4-1-2-3): Hart; Walker, Cahill, Smalling, Rose; Dier; Alli, Rooney; Sterling, Kane, Sturridge.\n\nIceland (4-4-2): Halldorsson; Saevarsson, Arnason, R Sigurdsson, Skulason; J Gudmundsson, Gunnarsson, G Sigurdsson, B Bjarnason; Bodvarsson, Sigthorsson.\n\nVerdict: England win 1-0.\n\nBrian Lee's big-match bet: Wayne Rooney to score in an England win is 7-2.\n\nItaly v Spain 5pm Stade de France, LIVE on BBC1\n\nA repeat of the 2012 final might have come too soon for the teams but it will really announce that the tournament is getting serious.\n\nThe Italians have fine-tuned their system beautifully and I like seeing them playing with two strikers.\n\nSergio Ramos and Gerard Pique face a big test looking after Graziano Pelle and Eder instead of one lone centre forward.\n\nSpain captain Sergio Ramos (right) shares a joke with goalkeeper Iker Casillas ahead of the Italy game\n\nItaly boss Antonio Conte made eight changes for the Ireland game so I expect them to be fresher, which could prove pivotal as they're certain to be chasing the ball a fair bit.\n\nItaly (3-5-2): Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Florenzi, Parolo, De Rossi, Giaccherini, Candreva; Eder, Pelle.\n\nSpain (4-3-3): De Gea; Juanfran, Pique, Ramos, Jordi Alba; Fabregas, Busquets, Iniesta; Silva, Morata, Nolito.\n\nVerdict: Italy win on penalties (1-1 aet).", "description": "Euro 2016's underwhelming group-stage is over and we're well underway with the knockout ties, which have so far proved a little more lively.
