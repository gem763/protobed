Successive governments, which provide the bulk of the budget through the culture ministry, have failed to make good on vague promises to replace the main 4,000-seat Sala Palatului hall, which was built in 1960 for communist party meetings and has poor acoustics.\n\n\u201cI wish someday that Bucharest can have a great concert hall, this must be possible somehow, but we have to wait,\u201d said Lawrence Foster, who conducted the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra to great acclaim.\n\n\u201cStill, it\u2019s a great honour to be asked here, it\u2019s an incredible festival.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s edition is the largest, conductor and the festival\u2019s artistic director Vladimir Jurowski said, with concerts in the capital Bucharest and across the country, as well as in six other countries, including Italy and Germany.\n\nClassical music will play in bookstores and petrol stations, while children\u2019s choirs will sing in corporate offices and parks. Fans can tour the old city haunts of Enescu.\n\n\u201cIt is a way for the public to understand the festival is not only for the Sala Palatului or concert halls,\u201d said Anita Sterea, organiser of the walking tour. \u201cThe festival is everywhere and we can all enjoy it.\u201d", "description": "Floating above the turbulent politics of modern-day Romania, the biennial George Enescu Festival is a welcome relief for Bucharest's classical music fans, with performances not just in the main concert hall but on street corners and in bookstores.", "authors": ["Luiza Ilie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427584619&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870HF", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
