Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in third quarter, campaign says", "language": "en", "text": "The third-quarter figures announced by the campaign rival his $26 million haul at this point in the primary campaign in 2015, when he stunned the Democratic field by nearly matching the total of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, with an infusion of money from donors giving less than $200. Yet this time, he is facing more than a dozen opponents.\n\nAD\n\nOne of them, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, announced early Tuesday that his campaign raised more than $19.1 million in the third quarter \u2014 less than Sanders did but an amount that gives him staying power in a crowded field.\n\nAD\n\nSanders campaign officials have expressed confidence in recent weeks about their fundraising. In September, the campaign announced it had amassed 1 million donors faster than any campaign in history \u2014 a milestone that officials said reflected enduring excitement surrounding the campaign.\n\nThe massive third-quarter haul is welcome news for Sanders supporters, who have seen their candidate fall behind former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in some recent polls. The Sanders campaign has also been dealing with staff turmoil in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nAD\n\nBernie Sanders has a problem. Her name is Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019s formidable fundraising email list, which has been without an equal in recent years, could help him weather those challenges into a crucial fall stretch.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s reported third-quarter contributions were less than what his campaign raised in the second quarter \u2014 when he surpassed all of his Democratic opponents with $24.8 million. But they were far greater than his first-quarter total of $7.1 million, when he entered the race as a relative unknown.\n\nAD\n\nHis campaign has spent the past quarter aggressively building out its operation and investing in early states, notably rolling out television ads in Iowa that seek to differentiate Buttigieg from Warren and Sanders when it comes to health care.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, Buttigieg has more than doubled his staff members in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada over the past several months, from 107 to 227. The campaign also now has 42 field offices throughout the country, 20 of which were opened in Iowa in September.\n\nWhile Sanders\u2019s support in the polls has fluctuated in his second run for president, his fundraising ability has been a reliable asset that has continued to stun some Democrats. He raised $6 million in the 24 hours after launching his campaign in February, prompting some leading Democrats to express surprise at his quick early pace.\n\nAD\n\nSo far, Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign has raised $61.5 million. Campaign officials declined Tuesday to specify how much he had in cash on hand by the end of the quarter.\n\nAD\n\nCandidates have until Oct. 15 to file fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission, but those with noteworthy numbers typically share their totals soon after a quarter ends. Monday was the final day of the third quarter, which began July 1.\n\nAs the midnight deadline loomed Monday, Democratic campaigns peppered supporters with appeals.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the truth: We\u2019ve sent a number of fundraising emails about tonight\u2019s deadline because, quite honestly, these messages are how we fund this campaign,\u201d read a Sanders campaign email Monday night, sent just hours before the close of quarter.\n\nThe final day of the third quarter was the second-biggest fundraising day of the Sanders campaign, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe average contribution since the Sanders campaign launched was $19, officials said.\n\nCandidates dash for cash, seeking money to sustain presidential campaigns and avoid a death spiral\n\nIn a statement, campaign manager Faiz Shakir compared Sanders\u2019s appeal to small-dollar donors to President Trump, who has consistently drawn donations from individuals giving less than $200.\n\nTheir contributions can fuel campaigns for a longer period of time, because it takes longer for such donors to reach the $2,800 maximum they can donate to a primary campaign.\n\nThe Democratic nominee will eventually face off against Trump\u2019s successful small-dollar fundraising operation.\n\n\u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution,\u201d Shakir said in the statement.\n\nAD\n\nSanders and Warren have opted not to host private fundraisers catering to wealthy campaign donors.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Sanders has supplemented his online fundraising with occasional in-person events his campaign has dubbed \u201cgrass-roots fundraisers.\u201d These unique gatherings, held in big cities such as San Francisco and New York, have featured far lower entry fees than candidates catering to wealthier donors typically charge.\n\nOne such event in Hollywood in late July included opening musical performers. Actor Danny Glover appeared at a San Francisco fundraiser in June.\n\nThe events have been built into Sanders\u2019s campaign schedule when it makes sense, officials said. Sanders has kept up a busy campaign pace in recent weeks, often making multiple stops a day and sometimes swinging through more than one state in a day.\n\nDemocratic donors responding to a flurry of appeals fueled campaigns and groups with a record-breaking amount of small-dollar donations on the last day of the third quarter, according to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform.\n\nActBlue announced that the platform on Monday had recorded the largest number of individual contributions in a day since its founding in 2004.\n\nAD", "description": "Sanders posted the largest quarterly haul to date in the Democratic presidential primaries, fueled by an army of low-dollar donors.", "authors": ["Michelle Ye Hee Lee", "National Political Enterprise", "Accountability Reporter Covering Money", "Influence In Politics", "Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mnK9lmo9Od-HB_Dq2S1l9m1BuM4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K3HVXPHECUI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
