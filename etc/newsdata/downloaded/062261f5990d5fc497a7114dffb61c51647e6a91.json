The data of 6 million Canadians was also included in the breach, with some Social Security and credit card numbers among the compromised data.\n\nFormer Amazon employee Paige Thompson was subsequently arrested and indicted by a federal grand jury in August for allegedly breaching servers containing customer data from Capital One and approximately 30 other companies.\n\nThompson was arrested after she posted about her theft of the data on GitHub and another user reported her to Capital One, which then alerted the FBI.\n\nWyden, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Warren, who serves on the Senate Banking Committee, made the case that Amazon may have broken the law through its failure to secure its servers against server side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, the method allegedly used by Thompson to gain access to the data.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHANDLE WITH CARE: Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) is asking the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies for sharing Americans' personal information with contractors, citing recent data breaches that exposed the information.\n\nHassan in a letter to Comptroller General Gene Dodaro zeroed in on the access contractors have to personally identifiable information, or PII, collected by DHS.\n\nThe senator, who serves on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked GAO to examine DHS requirements for contractors that have access to the information, along with any steps the agency takes if a data breach involving PII occurs.\n\n\"In many cases, DHS leverages the capabilities and expertise of contractors to assist it in its mission, and these contractors also have access to millions of Americans' PII,\" Hassan wrote. \"While the department's functions are essential, it is also essential that it protect the PII that is collected on the department's behalf from improper access or use.\"\n\nHassan cited three data breaches of DHS contractors over the past year that have exposed personal information, including a June incident involving a U.S. Customs and Border Protection contractor's network that led to the theft of photos of travelers at the border.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP: The United States and South Korea on Thursday launched a bilateral partnership focused on deepening technological collaboration, aiming to find solutions for security issues, natural disasters and infectious diseases.\n\nThe agreement between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate and South Korea's Ministry of Science and Information Communication Technologies was confirmed in a memorandum of understanding.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity to discuss mutual challenges, shared priorities, and joint opportunities that will yield benefits and positive impact to our citizens,\" William Bryan, a DHS senior official performing the duties of the under secretary for science and technology, said in a statement.\n\n\"Both of us bring a wealth of technical expertise and creative insights, which collectively can help achieve better informed decisions on where research and development investments can and should be made.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nHIDE AND SEEK: A senior Facebook official says Russian operatives trying to spread misinformation ahead of next year's presidential election are adopting new tactics to try and remain undetected, according to a report in Reuters on Thursday.\n\nNathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, told Reuters that the company has taken steps that are leaving those with fake accounts struggling. In turn, Russian accounts are cutting back on their followers and being more careful in introducing new content to avoid detection.\n\n\"If you are very, very loud, if you go viral very, very fast that's exactly the sort of thing that our automated systems will detect and flag,\" Gleicher told the news source. \"So when actors have really diligent, deliberate and effective operational security it weakens their ability to build an audience.\"\n\nGleicher's comments come after a network of Instagram accounts that was targeting U.S. users and was linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency was disbanded by Facebook on Monday.\n\nIn total, the network of accounts had about 246,000 followers, with 60 percent of those followers being Americans. However, according to Facebook, that number is well short of the 126 million Americans who possibly saw Russian-made content regarding the 2016 election.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTAKING THE PLUNGE: Twitter shares plunged on Thursday after the company reported third-quarter sales that missed expectations and said fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than projected.\n\nThe social media giant reported that sales in latest quarter increased 8.6 percent to $823.7 million, below predictions of $876 million. It also said revenue for the three months ending in December would top out at $1.01 billion rather than the projected $1.06 billion.\n\nIts shares fell 15 percent after the market opened.\n\n\"Greater-than-expected advertising seasonality\" and \"revenue product issues\" were to blame for the disappointing results, the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nTwitter earlier this year outlined settings issues that had allowed it to access users' data without their permission to display targeted advertisements and measure their effectiveness for marketers. Its letter indicated that removing that data adversely affected the company.\n\nRead more here.\n\nI'LL BE WATCHING YOU: Google employees are reportedly accusing leaders at the company of creating a surveillance tool critics think will be used on worker attempts to organize or talk about labor rights.\n\nBloomberg News obtained a memo written by an employee that discussed workers' concerns. Workers reportedly said they found a team at the company making a tool for workers' Google Chrome browser that would search internal systems.\n\nThe tool would flag staffers who create calendar events with more than 10 rooms or 100 people, the memo said, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIt reportedly claimed that the most likely reason is that \"this is an attempt of leadership to immediately learn about any workers organization attempts.\"\n\nGoogle denied the allegation in a tweet.\n\n\"These claims about the operation and purpose of this extension are categorically false. This is a pop-up reminder that asks people to be mindful before auto-adding a meeting to the calendars of large numbers of employees,\" the company said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCALLED OUT: CNN President Jeff Zucker on Thursday denounced Facebook for what he called its \"absolutely ludicrous\" policy that exempts political advertisements from fact-checking.\n\n\"[Facebook] took so much heat, rightly so, for what happened in 2016 and for the political advertising that aired on there,\" Zucker said during a CNN Citizen conference. \"And now they say that political advertising is just a tiny part of their business, but that they're not going to fact-check anything and they're going to take all political advertising whether it is true or not. I think that is absolutely ludicrous and I think that they should be called out.\"\n\nZucker went on to cite his network's policy surrounding advertisements, saying that CNN has already turned down two ads from President Trump Donald John TrumpSchedule for additional depositions in impeachment inquiry revealed Sondland attorney disputes key portions of Taylor testimony: report Impeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report MORE's reelection campaign because they didn't meet its standards.\n\n\"We have an obligation at CNN, if a political ad comes along and it's not true, we're not going to take it,\" he said. \"We've turned down I think two ads from the Trump campaign.

But we're only going to take them when they're truthful.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nA LIGHTER CLICK: What's his name again?\n\nAN OP-ED TO CHEW ON: Congress must confront online extremism\n\nNOTABLE LINKS FROM AROUND THE WEB:\n\nWhy scientists are so excited about \"quantum supremacy.\" (Vox)\n\nRupert Murdoch wanted Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHillicon Valley: Lawmakers unleash on Zuckerberg | House passes third election interference bill | Online extremism legislation advances in House | Google claims quantum computing breakthrough Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 Trump official declines to detail plans if ObamaCare struck down | DEA unveils rule for opioid manufacturers | Republican tells Zuckerberg to allow anti-vax content On The Money: Lawmakers hammer Zuckerberg over Facebook controversies | GOP chair expects another funding stopgap | Senate rejects Dem measure on SALT deduction cap workarounds MORE to pay him for news stories -- and now Facebook is going to do just that.
