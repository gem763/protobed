(AP) - Arizona played without its starting quarterback and its most productive running back, a combination that would have likely led to disaster last season.\n\nThis year\u2019s Wildcats have a different kind of swagger to them.\n\nBack-up quarterback, multiple running backs having to carry the load, young players in key positions - doesn\u2019t matter to them.\n\nGrant Gunnell threw for 352 yards and a touchdown in his first career start and Arizona held on to beat UCLA 20-17 Saturday night after JJ Molson missed a 39-yard field goal in the closing seconds.\n\n\u201cThese guys are learning on the run, they\u2019re growing up,\u201d Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. \u201cTo play in the last two games the way they\u2019ve played down the stretch, for a young football team (it\u2019s big)\u201d\n\nArizona (3-1, 1-0 Pac-12) played without its two best offensive players with quarterback Khalil Tate and running back J.J. Taylor out due to leg injuries.\n\nGunnell had seen spot action earlier this season, but was making his first collegiate start. The freshman played like he had been the starter all along, keeping his poise while completing 29 of 44 passes.\n\n\u201cI have full confidence in Grant,\u201d Arizona linebacker Tony Fields said. \u201cHe deals with us in practice every day and somehow, some finds a way to make plays like he did tonight.\u201d\n\nUCLA (1-4, 1-1) pulled off an epic comeback last week, rallying from 35 points down to beat Washington State. The Bruins needed another, not-so-monumental comeback after Gary Brightwell scored on a 10-yard run to put Arizona up 20-17.\n\nDorian Thompson-Robinson led the comeback against the Cougars, but left late in the third quarter after Arizona defensive end Jalen Harris fell on his left leg from behind.\n\nHis replacement, sophomore Austin Burton, had a chance when UCLA forced a punt and got the ball at its 9-yard line with 2:52 left.\n\nBurton worked the Bruins down the field quickly to Arizona\u2019s 21-yard line, but Molson pushed his field goal attempt wide right with 34 seconds left.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a lot of big kicks for us,\u201d UCLA coach Chip Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate it comes down to a kick at the end of the game. There\u2019s a lot of other plays you could make where it doesn\u2019t come down to a kick.\u201d\n\nUCLA saved its season and potentially Kelly\u2019s job last week with its 67-63 comeback win over then-No. 19 Washington State.\n\nThompson-Robinson had a school-record 564 yards of offense while accounting for seven touchdowns and looked like he was going to slice right through Arizona\u2019s defense as well.\n\nUCLA went 85 yards - 40 on Thompson-Robinson runs - in 12 plays on its opening drive and scored on Matt Lynch\u2019s 2-yard touchdown catch.\n\nThe Bruins sputtered after that, managing 100 yards the rest of the half.\n\nArizona was a little better at moving the ball - well, until it got to the red zone. The Wildcats crossed UCLA\u2019s 20-yard line three times in the first half and stalled each time, settling for two Lucas Havrisik field goals and another he missed.\n\nArizona didn\u2019t take long to get going in the second half, scoring on its first play when Darrius Smith took advantage of a breakdown in coverage by UCLA and streaked along the sideline alone for a 75-yard touchdown.\n\n\u201cYou rush three, drop eight into zone and they throw the ball over your head,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of a backbreaker.\u201d\n\nUCLA answered after Thompson-Robinson went down, scoring on a 3-yard run by Joshua Kelly after he broke off a 36-yard run to put UCLA up 17-13. Arizona again had its own answer, scoring on Brightwell\u2019s run and surviving the potential game-tying kick.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUCLA lost its starting quarterback and another chance at a comeback victory when Molson missed his kick.\n\nArizona pulled out a gritty win without two of its best players and may be hitting its stride after a disappointing season-opening loss to Hawaii.\n\nREVERSED TD\n\nArizona appeared to have a game-clinching touchdown midway through the fourth quarter when Brian Casteel caught a screen pass, broke a couple of tackles and raced into the end zone.\n\nOne problem: His knee was down when he caught Gunnell\u2019s pass.\n\nSo instead of a 42-yard score, Arizona took a two-yard loss and ended up punting the ball away after failing on a third-down try.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUCLA hosts Oregon State next Saturday.\n\nArizona plays at Colorado next Saturday.\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona played without its starting quarterback and its most productive running back, a combination that would have likely led to disaster last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/ucla_arizona_football_42485_c0-113-2713-1694_s1770x1032.jpg?c79769cb8d39f8a8415515b372f7f0756d53472c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
