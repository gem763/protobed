REUTERS/David Gray\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Macquarie-owned Green Investment Group (GIG) has invested more than 2.4 billion pounds ($3 billion) globally in low-carbon projects over the past year, it said in its second annual report on Thursday.\n\nThe GIG was bought by Australia\u2019s Macquarie Group (MQG.AX) in 2017 from the British government and invests in low-carbon energy and infrastructure projects.\n\nMacquarie, which had assets under management of $376.6 billion as of March 31, 2019, says it is using the GIG as its primary vehicle for principal investment in green projects in Britain and Europe.\n\nOver the period August 2018 to September 2019, the GIG invested and arranged more than 2.4 billion pounds of green capital and nearly 4 billion pounds over the past two years, it said.\n\nThe GIG now supports nearly half of Britain\u2019s total offshore wind capacity in operation or construction, it added.\n\nLast month, Macquarie said it would develop a 20-gigawatt portfolio of new renewable energy projects through the GIG, many of which will be backed by corporate power purchase agreements.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to develop a pipeline of 20 GW over the next five years is a central part of our efforts to help deliver a rapid increase in the pace and scale of renewable energy developments coming forward, particularly in emerging markets,\u201d said Mark Dooley, global head of the GIG.", "description": "Macquarie-owned Green Investment Group (GIG) has invested more than 2.4 billion pounds ($3 billion) globally in low-carbon projects over the past year, it said in its second annual report on Thursday.", "authors": ["Nina Chestney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436579762&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920ML"}
