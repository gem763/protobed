Swiss financial blog Inside Paradeplatz first reported the man\u2019s death, identifying him only as T. The man took his own life last Tuesday, according to Thomas Fingerhuth, a lawyer for the private investigative firm Investigo.\n\nAt a hastily organised press conference in Zurich, the Credit Suisse chairman, Urs Rohner, said he was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by Bou\u00e9e\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d decision to hire detectives to track the movements of Iqbal Khan, its outgoing head of wealth management.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner at a press conference on the spying scandal on Tuesday.

Khan had attempted to lose the tail by driving fast and erratically through the sleepy streets of Zurich\u2019s financial capital.\n\nAs he turned into B\u00f6rsenstrasse he leapt out of the car shouting \u201cpolice, police\u201d and whipped out his phone to take photos of the car number plate and three occupants, who were later revealed to be detectives from Investigo. Swiss police confirmed they had opened \u201ca criminal investigation into coercion/threat\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Iqbal Khan, former head of wealth management at Credit Suisse, was tailed by private investigators.

The bank has said there is no evidence to suggest Khan was seeking to poach clients. Khan\u2019s first day at UBS following garden leaving is Tuesday.\n\nCredit Suisse cleared its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, of ordering Bou\u00e9e to organise the spying, despite a long history of personal animosity between Thiam and Khan.\n\n\u201cThe chief operating officer assumed responsibility for this matter and submitted his resignation to the board of directors, which has been accepted with immediate effect,\u201d bank said. \u201cThe Homburger investigation did not identify any indication that the chief executive had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to 18 September 2019, after the observation had been aborted.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nKhan, 43, was born in Pakistan and immigrated to Switzerland aged 12. He had long wanted to rise further up the ranks at Credit Suisse but had been frustrated by Thiam, 57.\n\nPersonal relations between Thiam, the former head of British insurer Prudential, soured further when Khan bought the house immediately next door to his boss in the village of Herrliberg on the so-called \u201cgold coast\u201d of Lake Zurich. Khan had the house levelled to the ground, and rebuilt over two years with contractors often working early mornings and at weekends, leading Thiam to complain to the bank\u2019s chairman.\n\nIn an attempt at a rapprochement, in January Thiam invited Khan and his wife to a cocktail party for top colleagues and friends in the ultra-wealthy neighbourhood. But the pair had a heated argument about a row of trees Thiam had planted on his property that partially blocked Khan\u2019s view of the lake. Khan\u2019s wife had to stand between the two men to stop the dispute escalating further, according to a report by Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bank rules surveillance of outgoing head of wealth management Iqbal Khan was \u2018wrong and disproportionate\u2019", "authors": ["Rupert Neate", "Julia Kollewe", "Larry Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b41ce101d2933e038728c81b80d9383942ff697/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de2917846d3afeb97ad106a5dd71c750", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
