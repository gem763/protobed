But Byrd and others voting for the bill might have been shocked by what eighth-graders in Portland, Oregon, (and in other districts) are learning from the book assigned to them, a young people\u2019s version of A People\u2019s History of the United States by Howard Zinn, the late communist history professor. Zinn\u2019s book, in publication since 1980, has sold over a record-breaking 2.6 million, with popularity increasing. A flourishing Zinn industry spins off titles (A People\u2019s History of Sports, A People\u2019s History of Art History, etc.), produces curricular materials, documentaries, and fodder for other far-left textbooks.\n\nEighth-graders reading the adapted A Young People\u2019s History will first get an introduction from Zinn himself addressing them as \u201cmature enough to look at their nation\u2019s policies honestly\u201d before getting the Charles Beard 1935 version of the history of the Constitution. They will not, however, be told that Beard has been debunked by several historians\u2014only that he \u201cangered some people\u201d because he presented the writers of the Constitution as fearing that \u201cthe poor would demand a share of the rich people\u2019s property,\u201d including that of the 55 writers of the Constitution, all white men, most wealthy, according to Zinn. They denied the vote to women, Indians, slaves, and many property-less men. Yet, the \u201cproblem of democracy went deeper than the Constitution\u2019s limits on voting. It lay in the division of society into rich and poor.\u201d What with those with \u201cgreat wealth and power\u201d owning and controlling \u201cthe land, the money, the newspapers, the churches, and the educational system\u201d\u2014\u201cHow could voting cut into such power?\u201d\n\nAlexander Hamilton through selective quotation is cast as an elitist. James Madison in a Federalist Paper argues for a federal government because it is better able than a state government to keep down \u201criots, revolts, and civil disorder\u201d and \u201cPeople\u2019s desire for such \u2018wicked\u2019 things as \u2018an equal division of property.\u2019\u201d The Bill of Rights also is a cynical attempt to stop the rebellion of the oppressed, evidenced in the Sedition Act seven years later.\n\nEighth-graders might as well be reading the 1951 Outline Political History of the Americas by William Z. Foster, the General Secretary of the CPUSA from 1945 to 1956, who, pointing to the denial of franchise to Indians, \u201cNegroes,\u201d and women, wrote, \u201cThe aim of the capitalistic constitution writers . . . was to keep the franchise from the broad masses of toilers and to restrict it to the propertied classes, those who had a distinct interest in the exploitation of the workers.\u201d (In 1951, Zinn, according to his FBI file, was teaching Marxism at the Communist Party headquarters in Brooklyn.)\n\nZinn, in the adult version of his book, called the idea that \u201cthere really is such a thing as \u2018the United States\u2019\u201d or \u201ca \u2018national interest\u2019 represented by the Constitution, in territorial expansion, in the laws passed by Congress, the decisions of the courts. . .\u201d a \u201cpretense.\u201d The point is also made quite clear in the young people\u2019s version.\n\nIn his first Constitution Day proclamation, President Trump referred to \u201cthe enduring brilliance of our Founding Charter,\u201d a constitution \u201colder than any other written constitution in use today\u201d and \u201cfounded on a fundamental trust in America\u2019s citizens.\u201d He vowed to return government to the people, restore the three branches to their rightful functions, and reduce the size and impact of federal agencies.\n\nBut it is no wonder that the message does not resonate with young people. Their ears have been filled with Zinn\u2019s siren song of communism.", "description": "In 2004 Congress passed a law requiring that all publicly .09/17/2019 19:26:27PM EST.", "authors": ["Mary Grabar", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/274/2ef4ea91-0e0d-4cbe-b70f-46a51a59a6aa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
