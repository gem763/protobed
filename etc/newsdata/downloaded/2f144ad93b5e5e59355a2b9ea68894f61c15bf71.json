We are living longer than ever before, but face the challenge of population explosions, which has led to housing crises in urbanised areas.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Beautiful white dream homes\n\n- Fashion 20 years from now\n\n- The extraordinary unfolding homes\n\nWhat does this all mean for us as we hunch over our phones, shuffling into the increasingly digital days ahead? For the weary city commuter, the home\u2019s function has shifted more than ever into becoming a healing space \u2013 a place to rest after surviving the daily melee of the metropolis.\n\nIt\u2019s a theme that pervades a series of immersive installations in Welcome Home at Elephant West, London. Inviting a group of artists and designers to imagine a room for a future home, gallery curator Becca Pelly-Fry asked them to consider the functions they would want them to serve in order to address concerns about where our future is heading.\n\n\u201cI think the way that we are living in urban environments is really cheek-by-jowl. Our cities are getting busier and busier,\u201d Pelly-Fry tells BBC Designed. \u201cPersonally, I feel my home is a sanctuary space where I can escape from the city and find some calm and peace, rest and restoration before going back out into the fray the next day.\u201d\n\nThe idea of the nuclear family of the 1950s feels like an old-fashioned concept to today\u2019s city dweller. The paradigm where people would traditionally live in single-family homes in stable two-parent families, with children who spent mealtimes together around the dining table, feels like something that Britain lost after the 1960s. Recently the idea that this was ever the predominant way of living has been questioned by academics.\n\nPelly-Fry says exploring the idea of home feels urgent during these times: \u201cNow it\u2019s becoming much more fractured, I suppose the idea of family is changing, shifting as well from that to all these other questions around society setup,\u201d she explains. \u201cAlso the price of living has changed the dynamic, like [the increase in] shared living spaces.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I think about my own flat for example, we don\u2019t have a dining room, we don\u2019t have a place to sit around a table. I work from home [and] so does my brother who I live with, which is also an interesting thing,\u201d she laughs: \u201cI\u2019m in my late-30s and living with my brother \u2013 because we live in London!\u201d\n\nAlong with the blurring of the line between informal and formal rooms in the home, in a lifetime we\u2019ve witnessed the death of the dining room, as mealtimes became informal events where we sprawl in front of screens. Although our love affair with our phones isn\u2019t showing any sign of abating, perhaps our future selves will reflect on this behaviour.\n\nIn an increasingly nomadic society an inflatable lilo is perhaps the ideal place to relax\n\nIt\u2019s a concern shared by artist David Rickard who considers the future of the bedroom within what he calls \u201cour interconnected culture of sharing and self-surveillance, through our devices always connected to the omnipresent Internet of things\u201d.\n\nIn his installation Adrift, a surrounding copper Faraday mesh (a material used to block electromagnetic fields) calls attention to the issue of digital privacy in data sharing, and protection against what some call \u2018electromagnetic smog\u2019: magnetic fields from laptops, wi-fi routers, and phones that we carry with us every day.\n\nPelly-Fry explains: \u201cDavid Rickard is particularly interested in ideas of safety, security and boundaries that we draw. What [the boundaries] are and why we draw them... we are thinking of the bedroom as a boundary we draw ourselves [and] that we withdraw our bodies into for rest and privacy, in particular for all those things you don\u2019t want other people to see.\n\n\u201cAnd now [Rickard] is reimagining that, especially in a world where we might be looking at much more shared living space, where instead of hot-desking, you hot-rest on a large memory-foam floor, so you can sleep anywhere on it.\u201d Rickard suggests that in an increasingly nomadic society an inflatable lilo is perhaps the ideal place to relax, staying afloat as sea levels rise.\n\n\u2018Messy antidote\u2019\n\nSomewhere between a garden and a bathroom medicine cabinet, Amanda Baum and Rose Leahy\u2019s installation Host aims to address the concern of the increasing sanitisation of modern domestic spaces. According to the artists, this could trigger a \u201csilent microbiome crisis\u201d in which the loss of diverse microbial communities puts our overall health at risk.\n\nIn response, they created what they call \u201ca messy antidote\u201d, a space that you go to in order to heal your body cell by cell, from the inside out. Through collaborations with scientists and designers, the pair aim to translate complex ecological dynamics into experiences that engage all of the senses \u2013 in this case, they invite visitors to immerse themselves into a future of microbiophilic living.\n\nIn the future our surrounding surfaces could be designed to host different forms of life\n\nGlass vessels are suspended over soft, gut-like cushions that host live microbial communities. The cultures flow between the vessels, distributed via mist and reside on the surrounding surfaces. Porous tiles, developed with architect Richard Beckett, imagine how in the future our surrounding surfaces could be designed to host different forms of life through regenerative architecture.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really concerned with the state of our microbiome,\u201d explains Pelly-Fry. \u201cThere is research to indicate the health of our collective gut is massively in decline. For a number of different reasons the toxins we\u2019re ingesting, even the water that we drink is not really pure and clean anymore. It\u2019s gradually degrading the quality and health of our internal world \u2013 which is terrifying.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 imagine a room in your home where you go to replenish your microbe, so a bit like you might go do some meditation to replenish your mind\u201d\n\nOur bodies require essential nutrients like the sodium in salt, but not too much. Research has found that too much salt can cause high blood pressure, but a recent study has suggested a low-salt diet could be just as dangerous. So maybe we need to re-evaluate the ubiquitous kitchen staple?\n\nThe experiential food-based events company Bompas and Parr landed on the map a few years ago for their architectural jelly, but for Welcome Home, they have created a highly ornate Rococo-style salt cave, based on the kind used as a healing space in what is known as halotherapy, particularly in eastern Europe where they can be naturally found as subterranean environments.\n\nVisitors are invited to walk through an illuminated temple, feel their way among a bed of salt and savour common and rare salts in a choreographed tasting experience. One might even reflect on an altar of precious 'salts' from The Worshipful Company of Salters \u2013 including a solid silver Georgian ladle and Sheffield plate salts from the 1800s. The Salters are one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, whose motto is: Sal Sapit Omnia, Latin for \u2018Salt Savours All\u2019.\n\nBombas and Parr\u2019s Temple is informative about what salt has meant through the years \u2013 wars have been fought over salt, trade routes formed for it, vocabulary and tradition developed alongside it \u2013 but it suggests that its intake should not be demonised as much as we think. However, like all the other visionary ideas behind rooms we could see in a future home, it\u2019s one that should be taken with a pinch of, well, you know.\n\nWelcome Home is at Elephant West, London until 6 October\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
