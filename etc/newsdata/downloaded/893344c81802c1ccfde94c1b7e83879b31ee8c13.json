On The Goldbergs! Photo: ABC\n\nABC is planning a Throwback Thursday stunt big enough to last seven nights. During the week of October 7, nearly a dozen Alphabet comedies and dramas will feature retro reunions of casts from various movies and TV shows, including key cast members from Cheers, The Drew Carey Show, Charmed, Think Like a Man, and Wet Hot American Summer. While broadcast networks once made regular use of themed weeks and nights, they\u2019ve become less common in recent years, as linear viewing has declined and audiences have started watching on their own timetables. What ABC is calling \u201cCast From the Past Week\u201d seems designed to fight back against that trend, while also helping the network keep a spotlight on its shows as the glow of fall premiere week starts to fade.\n\nFor \u201980s and \u201990s kids, the most notable previously unannounced reunions of ABC\u2019s stunt will take place on American Housewife and The Goldbergs. The latter has recruited former Cheers barmates Kirstie Alley, Rhea Perlman, George Wendt, and John Ratzenberger to get back together for an episode (airing October 9) in which the foursome ends up sharing a beer with each other at Bev Goldberg\u2019s house. Two nights later, Drew Carey, Kathy Kinney, and Ryan Styles will reunite with Diedrich Bader, their former castmate from Carey\u2019s eponymous ABC sitcom, on Bader\u2019s current comedy American Housewife.\n\nAlso on tap for ABC\u2019s themed week:\n\n\u2022 Dan Aykroyd will appear on the October 8 episode of The Conners, reuniting him with his Blues Brothers 2000 co-star John Goodman.\n\n\u2022 The same night, Michael Ian Black stops by Bless This Mess, which stars his fellow Wet Hot American Summer alum Lake Bell, while Girlfriends stars Golden Brooks, Jill Marie Jones, and Persia White visit Tracee Ellis Ross on Black-ish.\n\n\u2022 On October 10, Charmed vets Alyssa Milano and Holly Marie Combs will conjure up a visit to Grey\u2019s Anatomy (the ABC hit doesn\u2019t feature any actors from Charmed, but showrunner Krista Vernoff and exec producer Andy Reaser were writers on the WB fantasy drama). The same night, Jerry Ferrara guests on A Million Little Things, putting him on set with his Think Like a Man castmate Romany Malco.\n\n\u2022 Seamus Deaver and Jon Huertas reunite with their Castle star Nathan Fillion on the latter\u2019s current show, The Rookie, on October 13.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s unlikely these casting stunts will result in any ABC show getting a massive surge in viewership. But in this era of limited attention spans and yearly audience erosion, \u201cCast From the Past Week\u201d is an attempt to keep audiences engaged with the broadcast ecosystem and help generate some much-needed promotional buzz with both traditional and social media. The retro theme is also smart, since it leans into nostalgia among the older viewers who now make up the bulk of the broadcast audience. ABC execs saw firsthand how retro done right can pay off when last May\u2019s Live in Front of a Studio Audience drew over 20 million viewers by serving up live recreations of All in the Family and The Jeffersons. If \u201cCast From the Past Week\u201d is a success, maybe it\u2019s not too late for NBC to try a 25th anniversary salute in November to 1994\u2019s \u201cBlackout Thursday,\u201d using the network\u2019s current sitcom lineup.", "description": "The programming stunt will turn ABC shows into retro reunions of Cheers, The Drew Carey Show, Charmed, and other beloved \u201880s and \u201890s TV and movies.", "authors": ["Josef Adalian"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/16/16-cheers-abc-the-goldbergs.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
