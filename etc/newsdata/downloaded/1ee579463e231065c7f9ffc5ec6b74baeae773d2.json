The campaign will involve participating businesses publicly supporting the strikes and allowing employees to take part if they choose to.\n\nAs the former leader of influential left-wing group GetUp, Sheikh is no stranger to environmental activism and has recruited a strong celebrity endorsement from the business world in Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes.\n\nCannon-Brookes issued a media statement paying homage to teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg \u2014 who will attend the New York City strike \u2014 and pledging support to Future Super\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cHumanity faces a climate change emergency \u2014 it\u2019s a crisis that demands leadership and action,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTens of thousands of schoolkids joined the cause and turned out in force at a series of school strikes. Now, we want Atlassians to have the opportunity to add their voices, if they choose.\u201d\n\nCannon-Brookes himself plans to attend one of the strikes depending on his travel schedule, an Atlassian spokesperson told Business Insider Australia.\n\nAnd with more than 150 events already being planned in locations around the world, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for the environmentally-conscious billionaire \u2014 or his 3,000 employees across nine offices \u2014 to get to one of them.\n\nThe spokesperson clarified that Atlassian will not technically be closing down for the day, but instead is offering public and internal support for the event without hurting business.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure our people can attend with no impact to our many customers,\u201d Cannon-Brookes said in the statement.\n\n\u201cAnd those in critical functions will be encouraged to have their say in other ways. The bottom line is this: our staff who attend will have Atlassian\u2019s full support.\u201d\n\nThose Atlassian employees who can\u2019t strike because they are \u201con shift in any critical capacity\u201d are being encouraged to volunteer for climate-organisations at another time, Atlassian HR executive Jess Hyman is telling employees, Business Insider Australia understands.\n\nAll Atlassian employees are entitled to one week\u2019s leave to do volunteer charity work \u2014 a work perk that hasn\u2019t stopped the company plummeting on the list of Australia\u2019s 50 Best Places to Work this year.\n\nFuture Super is going a step further, officially shutting up shop on 20 September \u2014 although admittedly Australia\u2019s self-described \u201cfirst 100% fossil free super fund\u201d is not a $1 billion revenue organisation just yet.\n\nBut even those who can\u2019t go the whole hog can do something, Sheikh said.\n\n\u201cBusinesses who support their employees will be sending out a powerful message that this is not business as usual,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to put boots on the ground and help solve the climate crisis, and by coming together we all have the power to be part of the solution to solve the moral challenge of our generation.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s lucky that at least two of those boots belong to one of Australia\u2019s most high-profile businesspeople.\n\nHere are the 16 organisations signed up the the \u2018Not Business as Usual\u2019 campaign\n\nKeepCup\n\nDumbo Feather\n\nImpact Investment Groups\n\nSmall Giants\n\nAmber\n\nAtlassian\n\nEnergy Lab\n\nStartmate\n\nCodeBarrel\n\nDovetail\n\nGrok Ventures\n\nBrand Crush\n\nTech Sydney\n\nMotherhood App\n\nACCR\n\nFuture Super\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
