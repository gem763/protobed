TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe debate in Australia over climbing Uluru has raged for decades, and has been further inflamed by visitors acting particularly insensitively -- including a French tourist who stripped down to a bikini in 2010.\n\n\"Over the years Anangu have felt a sense of intimidation, as if someone is holding a gun to our heads to keep it open,\" Wilson said.\n\nIn 2009, the park released a draft proposal recommending a blanket ban on climbing. It failed to get government backing, with opponents of the ban claiming it would hurt Australia's tourism industry.\n\nNonetheless, the number of climbers has been in steady decline -- which may be partly attributed to safety concerns. Conditions are steep and temperatures often sweltering. Thirty-six people have died while climbing since records began in 1958, with the most recent death recorded in 2010.\n\nAccording to the park's data, in the 1990s the number of visitors who climbed Uluru was 74%, which fell to 28% in 2010 and just 16.2% in 2015. In 2015, 300,000 people visited Uluru, which was formerly known by its colonial name of Ayers Rock.\n\nA significant date\n\nUluru is not \"Disnyeland,\" say officials.

Their calls to end the climbing of Uluru began that same year and signs asking people to reconsider climbing were first erected in 1992.\n\nIn 1985, the Commonwealth Government of Australia returned Uluru to the traditional custodians of the land (also known as traditional or community owners), the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people, who are also known as Anangu.\n\nUluru is sacred to Australia's indigenous peoples because it's believed to have been formed during the Dreamtime, which is the ancient period when all living things were created, and whose spirits continue into the present.\n\nThe massive rock is thought to have once been a Dreamtime ancestor who roamed the Earth and created the features of the landscape, before turning into the distinctive landform it is today. Archaeological findings indicate that humans settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago. Uluru is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\"It is an extremely important place, not a playground or theme park like Disneyland. We've been thinking about this for a very long time,\" Wilson said.\n\nWhat does it mean for tourism?\n\nUluru is visited by thousands of people a year. Mark Kolbe/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nIn 2010, the board said it would give the tourism industry a minimum of 18 months' notice to accommodate the change into itineraries and marketing campaigns. Visitors will therefore be able to climb Uluru for another two years, though it will be discouraged.\n\nWilson said in his speech that tourists will continue to be welcomed to the area, saying: \"We are not stopping tourism, just this activity.\"\n\nJohn O'Sullivan, managing director of Tourism Australia, told CNN he welcomed the decision.\n\n\"It's always been the wishes of the traditional owners that visitors to the park don't climb to the top of Uluru, and I think that's something both domestic and international tourists will understand and respect,\" he said.\n\nVisitors will still be able to enjoy the area, without climbing the monolith.

It is a truly beautiful and spiritual place: you don't need to climb it to experience that.\"\n\nAmerican events organizer and writer Theresa Winters, who is a Sydney resident, said she chose not to climb it, but her friend did.", "description": "The long debate over Australia's sacred Uluru is over.
