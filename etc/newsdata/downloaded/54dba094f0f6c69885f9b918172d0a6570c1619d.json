Oil prices edge up, supported by Iran ship attack, U.S.-China trade detente * Prices rise 2% on Friday after Iran tanker attack\n\n* Traders eye U.S.-China pact, details of phase 1 agreement\n\n\n\nBy Florence Tan\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed\n\non Monday, holding onto 2% gains from Friday amid renewed\n\ngeopolitical tensions in the Middle East, while a detente in the\n\nU.S.-China trade war buoyed market sentiment.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 9 cents to $60.60 a barrel\n\nby 1208 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude\n\nfutures was at $54.79 a barrel, up 9 cents.\n\nBoth contracts rose more than 3% last week, their first\n\nweekly gain in three weeks.\n\nMost of the gains were posted on Friday after an Iranian oil\n\ntanker was attacked off Saudi Arabia's coast in the Red Sea.\n\nInvestigations are under way to determine if the tanker was hit\n\nby missiles, which could ratchet up tensions between Tehran and\n\nRiyadh if confirmed. The emergence of a phase 1 trade deal between the United\n\nStates and China and a goodwill move by Washington to suspend\n\nthreatened tariffs on Chinese products also lifted global\n\nfinancial markets. Investors remained cautious given that few details emerged\n\nfrom the talks, while it may take another five weeks for the two\n\ncountries to sign a pact.\n\n\"Traders view the deal in a tentative light as a tariff\n\ndetente falls well short of bridging the critical trust gap\n\nwhich is an implicit removal of a significant chunk of existing\n\ntariff,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader in a note.\n\n\"This baby-step agreement could take weeks to iron out.\"\n\n\n\nOil prices edge up, supported by Iran ship attack, U.S.-China trade detente", "description": "Oil prices edge up, supported by Iran ship attack, U.S.-China trade detente", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6604O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
