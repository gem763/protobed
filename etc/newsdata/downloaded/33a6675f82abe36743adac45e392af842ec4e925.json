Gen. Howell on Sunday for leading the mission.\n\n'We salute our military members and special forces, led by KY-1 Cadiz native Lieutenant General Scott Howell, for their distinguished service in bringing down ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. America is grateful for their bravery,' he said.\n\nIt is not clear if Lt. Gen. Howell was on the ground in Syria.\n\nLt. Gen. Howell is a command pilot with more than 2,600 flight hours.\n\nHe is the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command in Fort Bragg, North Carolina - the home of Delta Force.\n\nHowell, pictured in Afghanistan, is a career helicopter pilot who is now the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command in Fort Bragg North Carolina\n\nISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi blew himself up after being cornered by U.S forces in a dead-end underground tunnel in his Syrian compound\n\nPrior to assuming the command last year, Lt. Gen. Howell was vice commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command in Washington D.C.\n\nLt. Gen. Howell, who was commissioned through the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1987, earned his wings at Fort Rucker in Alabama.\n\nHe is a career helicopter pilot whose rescue and special operations include assignments in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe daring raid on the compound where al-Baghdadi was hiding was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work - and 48 hours of hurry-up planning once Washington got word on where he would be.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said three previous attempts to capture the ISIS leader had been canceled because al-Baghdadi, who was under surveillance, had changed his mind about where he was going.\n\nTrump watched the raid in real time from the Situation Room via a video link as troops blasted into the hideout and sent the most-wanted militant running the last steps of his life.\n\nAn aerial view of the site taken today shows the damage the helicopter caused on the site where al-Baghdadi was thought to have lived\n\nU.S. troops obliterated the compound where ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died on Saturday before they retreated\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning. His lair was in a village known for smuggling, and he arrived there 48 hours before the raid\n\nThe raid was named after Kayla Mueller, a US aid worker, who was captured by the jihadists in 2013 and repeatedly raped and tortured by Baghdadi until she was murdered in 2015.\n\nTrump said soldiers blasted a hole in the side of a building because they feared the entrance might have been booby-trapped. Al-Baghdadi fled into a network of underground bunkers and tunnels that snaked through the compound.\n\nThe stout, bearded militant leader wore a suicide vest and dragged along three children as he fled from the American troops.\n\nTrump, happy to play up the drama, said that as U.S. troops and their dogs closed in, the militant went 'whimpering and crying and screaming all the way' to his death.\n\n'He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down,' Trump said. 'He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.'\n\nAl-Baghdadi's body was mutilated in the blast and the tunnel caved in on him. To get to his corpse, troops had to dig through debris.\n\nNot much of al-Baghdadi was left \u2013 but enough for a DNA test using a small field kit.\n\nOnce al-Baghdadi was confirmed dead, U.S. forces grabbed every computer, every phone, every bit of paper they could find before retreating.\n\nThe last action was to call in an airstrike by US drones, reducing Baghdadi's hideout to rubble, wiping it from the face of the Earth and covering their tracks.", "description": "Lieutenant General Scott Howell, of Cadiz, Kentucky, has been credited with helping plan and lead the dramatic raid to kill\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u00a0in Syria on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/14/20283668-0-image-a-3_1572274580695.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
