When you\u2019re picking players from Barca, Juve and Liverpool you can play a certain way. If we were so terrible why were we difficult to beat?\u201d #GAWA pic.twitter.com/YtpcBlc3cy \u2014 Ian Parker (@iparkysport) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t go there to entertain Ronald Koeman, that wasn\u2019t the purpose of what we did,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant to me. You give respect to the opponent and how they play.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re picking players from Barcelona, Juventus and Liverpool you can play a certain way. If we were so terrible why were we so difficult to beat? And clearly we were extremely difficult to beat.\n\nMichael O\u00b4Neill was unimpressed by Ronald Koeman\u00b4s criticism of his side (Niall Carson/PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that a manager of that class feels the need to say that. It\u2019s not something we need to dwell on.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude14 After a massive effort from our lads it finishes 3-1 to @OnsOranje in Rotterdam #GAWA pic.twitter.com/El4tlbQLYH \u2014 Northern Ireland (@NorthernIreland) October 10, 2019\n\nO\u2019Neill said he was yet to watch Thursday\u2019s defeat back, which had left some raw emotions as Northern Ireland watched their Euro 2020 qualification hopes all but disappear in the space of 15 minutes.\n\nA win would have left Northern Ireland needing a draw against the Dutch in Belfast next month while a draw would have kept them very much alive.\n\nBut the defeat now means they have only the faintest of hopes of escaping Group C and are instead looking to the play-offs.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t watched the game back,\u201d O\u2019Neill said ahead of Monday\u2019s friendly against the Czech Republic in Prague.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ll do that for November but it\u2019s not relevant for this game.\n\n\u201cThe nature of how we lost, not only the timing but the nature of the goal, it was a very fortunate goal for (Luuk) De Jong, to get a second opportunity and put the ball in the net when he mishit his first touch\u2026it was very cruel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we deserved it but we have to accept it, move on and make sure we do well in the game tomorrow to be ready for November.\u201d\n\nThe process begins with a friendly against the Czech Republic, a side buoyed by Friday\u2019s upset of England. Gareth Southgate\u2019s side lost 2-1 in Prague to suffer their first qualifying defeat in a decade.\n\n\u201cThey are obviously more experienced and we very impressed by what we saw in the game on Friday night, having watched it back last night,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good, it will be a stiff test for us, their coach may make changes and do things as well. The main thing is that both teams get what they want from the game.\u201d\n\nThe odds will perhaps be against Northern Ireland, without an away win in a friendly since 2006, but O\u2019Neill is expected to field a strong side having initially indicated he could make sweeping changes.\n\nCardiff defender Ciaron Brown and Linfield striker Shayne Lavery flew to Romania to join up with Ian Baraclough\u2019s under-21s side, leaving 21 players in Prague.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good decision to let them to go the under-21s as opposed to possibly playing a tiny part of this game,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\n\u201cIt will strengthen Ian\u2019s hand as he\u2019s had one or two injury problems.\n\n\u201cThe mood is good. We took the players out for dinner in Rotterdam on Friday night and that was good and it lifted the mood.\u201d", "description": "O\u00b4Neill\u00b4s men were minutes away from a draw in Holland before conceding two stoppage-time goals.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/19/wire-19662538-1570990153-693_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
