The film\u2014set during a time when the moon has been colonized and humankind is trying to explore the outer reaches of space\u2014begins with a mysterious global catastrophe in which most of Earth loses power. The source is an unspecified surge of energy from Neptune, which is where Roy\u2019s father was last heard from. So Roy is sent in search of his Clifford, hopping on a rocket to the moon, then making his way to Mars and the planets beyond, switching between private enterprises and military operations.\n\nGray, who co-wrote the film with Ethan Gross, quietly crafts a rotting world overrun with cheap commercialism. This is not the apocalyptic dust-bowl landscape of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Interstellar, and only a smidgen of time is spent on our planet before Roy blasts off. But there are plenty of mundane and depressing details to ponder, including that expensive spaceflight pillow and the prevalence of chains such as Subway and Applebee\u2019s on the moon. Pitt\u2019s performance is taciturn, but it\u2019s a thoughtful piece of characterization. Even though Roy monologues in voice-over about the glory of exploration, his public persona has the kind of unemotional disposition demanded by his military career.\n\nFOX\n\nRoy clearly inherited that coolheadedness from his dad, and as Roy travels farther away from home, the underlying tension of Ad Astra\u2019s plot comes into focus. Was the professional but aloof father that Roy knew just a facade? Was there something darker churning underneath, or did space somehow change Clifford for the worse? Gray uses those unanswered questions to push his narrative along, but as in The Lost City of Z, Roy\u2019s relationships with the people around him prove to be just as crucial as the bigger, scarier themes of man\u2019s relationship to the great unknown.\n\nAd Astra shares some superficial similarities with Interstellar, including its cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema (who has a special gift for galactic-size canvases), and its premise of parents and children working out their feelings in spaceships. But this is more of a character-driven genre film than Nolan\u2019s existential epic. Roy is something of a Man With No Name, a lonesome cowboy on a wagon train through the stars who runs into an assortment of intriguing people along the way. Among the scene-stealers are a steely Ruth Negga as a stressed-out Martian colonist, a sorrowful Donald Sutherland as a former colleague of Clifford\u2019s, and Liv Tyler in a largely undercooked role as Roy\u2019s estranged wife.\n\nEach of the film\u2019s set pieces is softly spectacular: a buggy chase across the sandy craters of the moon, a creepy encounter with another distressed ship in deep space, and a particularly dramatic spacewalking sequence. But each scene functions as a building block in the tale Gray is telling about Roy, whose dispassionate professionalism saves his life on many occasions, but who might not have enough empathy for the world around him. In the tremendous final act, Gray fleshes out all those dilemmas, gently but powerfully. The lesson of the film is a straightforward one\u2014that in the future, people will still need to rely on one another\u2014but Ad Astra communicates it with staggering profundity.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
