Katie Hill admits to \u2018inappropriate relationship\u2019 with campaign aide as Ethics Committee announces investigation", "language": "en", "text": "Freshmen Democrat Rep. Katie Hill has admitted to having a relationship with a young campaign aide but continues to deny an affair with her current Legislative Director:\n\n/2 Hill: \u201cDuring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign. I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment.\u201d \u2014 John Bresnahan (@BresPolitico) October 23, 2019\n\n/4 Hill says she is \u201cfully and proactively cooperating with the Ethics Committee.\u201d \u2014 John Bresnahan (@BresPolitico) October 23, 2019\n\nLast week RedState published allegations, including photos and text messages, that Hill had been involved in a \u201cthrouple\u201d relationship with her husband and a 22-year-old campaign aide up until the start of 2019 when Hill came to Washington DC. That story was a follow-up to earlier claims that Hill\u2019s husband was seeking a divorce after she engaged in an affair with her former finance director and current Legislative Director. House ethics rules prohibit Members of Congress from having sexual relationships with their subordinates. Today the House Ethics Committee announced it was looking into the allegations:\n\n\u201cThe Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Katie Hill may have engaged in a sexual relationship with an individual on her congressional staff, in violation of House Rule XXIII, clause 18 (a),\u201d Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), the committee\u2019s chairman, and Rep. Kenny Marchant (Texas), the top Republican on the panel, said in a statement.\n\nSo, at this point, Hill has admitted the allegations involving the campaign aide. She really had no choice since those claims were backed up by photos. She admits that relationship was unwise but it wouldn\u2019t get in hot water with the House Ethics committee because it happened before she became a member of congress. However, Hill is still denying the affair within her office which would be covered by ethics rules.\n\n\u201cAllegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false,\u201d Hill said Tuesday. \u201cI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties.\u201d\n\nThis CBS Los Angeles news story says there is no evidence to support the allegation about the affair with her legislative director. That\u2019s not quite true as Red State did publish a text message in which Hill\u2019s husband asked a friend if he knew about the affair. The friend replied, \u201cI do know yes, but I didn\u2019t know until recently.\u201d", "description": "\"...I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Katie-Hill.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
