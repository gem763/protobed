If it happens, it would be Britain\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nThe UK had been keen for discussions to continue through the weekend, but they were set to restart on Monday.\n\n\u2013 A week\u2019s window \u2013\n\nJohnson\u2019s proposals, submitted Wednesday, \u201cdo not provide a basis for concluding an agreement,\u201d a European Commission spokeswoman underlined on Friday.\n\nThe EU refuses to characterise the talks held so far as negotiations, preferring to resurrect a Brexit withdrawal agreement struck with Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May that has been rejected three times by British MPs.\n\nThe main sticking point is a \u201cbackstop\u201d for Northern Ireland that under the May agreement would have seen all the UK, or at least Northern Ireland, remaining in the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nIt is meant to guarantee that no border springs up between the British territory and EU member Ireland \u2014 which would threaten the hard-won Good Friday peace accord \u2014 while also maintaining the integrity of the EU\u2019s single market.\n\nBritain\u2019s current idea for an alternative is for untried technology to remove the need for most but not all border checks, and for EU standards on goods to continue to apply in Northern Ireland to facilitate trade.\n\nThis border plan is not acceptable for the EU. It sees the potential for rampant smuggling \u2014 especially as Johnson intends for the rest of the UK to diverge from EU labour, environmental and tax norms to aim for a regulation-lite economy on Europe\u2019s doorstep.\n\nJohnson on Saturday called his plan \u201ca practical compromise that gives ground where necessary\u201d but has also previously suggested it was a broad \u201clanding zone\u201d \u2014 which to Brussels suggests he might yet budge on issues it finds unacceptable.\n\nBut in identical articles for the Brexit-backing British tabloids the Sunday Express and the Sun on Sunday, Johnson said the bloc now needed to show \u201cits own willingness to do a deal that the UK Parliament can support\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey should be under no illusions or misapprehensions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere will be no more dither or delay. On October 31 we are going to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s leader Leo Varadkar said that while Britain\u2019s current proposals do not yet \u201cform the basis for deeper negotiations\u201d, there is \u201cplenty of time\u201d to put forward alternatives and he was trying to arrange a meeting with Johnson next week, reported Irish broadcaster RTE.\n\n\u2013 Early UK elections possible \u2013\n\nNor does the EU agree with a proposal giving Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly an effective veto over the post-Brexit customs arrangement.\n\nIf Johnson does not alter those points, it is hard to see the EU moving talks into the negotiation phase.\n\nYet if he bends on them, Johnson risks losing tenuous support in the UK parliament to maybe pass a Brexit deal, reliant on 10 Democratic Unionist MPs from Northern Ireland and hard-core Brexit MPs in his Conservative Party.\n\nIf thwarted, Johnson\u2019s best bet may lie with early elections \u2014 but those could only happen after the date he has said Brexit would happen.\n\nThere he also faces a challenge, with the UK parliament having passed a law requiring him to seek a Brexit extension from the EU by October 19 if he has not reached a deal by then.", "description": "Brussels (AFP) \u2013 With the resumption of crunch Brexit talks on Monday looming large, European leaders piled pressure on British Prime Minister Boris", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/f4e790_time-is-running-short-britain-eu-close-big-gaps-uk-proposals-managed-brexit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
