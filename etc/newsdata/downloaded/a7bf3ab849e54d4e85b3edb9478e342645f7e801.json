As I noted previously:\n\nOne of the reasons given for the push to new highs was the \u2018better than expected\u2019 earnings reports coming in. As noted by FactSet:\n\n\u201c78% have reported actual EPS above the mean EPS estimate\u2026The percentage of companies reporting EPS above the mean EPS estimate is above the 1-year (76%) average and above the 5-year (72%) average.\u201d\n\nThe problem is the \u201cbeat rate\u201d was simply due to the consistent \u2018lowering of the bar\u2019 as shown in the chart below:\n\nEPS Estimates\n\nBeginning in mid-October last year, estimates for both 2019 and 2020 crashed.\n\nThis is why I call it \u2018Millennial Soccer.\u2019\n\nEarnings season is now a \u2018game\u2019 where scores aren\u2019t kept, the media cheers, and everyone gets a \u2018participation trophy\u2019 just for showing up.\n\nYou also can\u2019t turn on financial television, or read a financial website, without the continual droning from a Wall Street analyst about why the markets are destined to go higher, or why you should be buying XYZ stock.\n\nThe mainstream press, most financial advisers, and the average investor, unfortunately take this information as \u201cfact,\u201d and use it as a basis for portfolio investment decisions.\n\nBut why wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nAfter all, Carl Gugasian of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe just rated Bianchi Corp. a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d That rating is surely something that you can \u201ctake to the bank,\u201dright?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nFor many years, I have counseled individuals to disregard mainstream analysts, Wall Street recommendations, and even MorningStar ratings, due to the inherent conflict of interest between the firms and their particular client\u00e8le. Here is the point:\n\nYOU, are NOT Wall Street\u2019s client.\n\nYOU are the CONSUMER of the products sold FOR Wall Street\u2019s clients.\n\nMajor brokerage firms are big business. I mean REALLY big business. As in $1.8 Trillion a year in revenue big. The table below shows the annual revenue of 40 of the largest financial firms in the S&P 500.\n\nAnnual Revenue Of 40 Of The Largest Financial Firms In The S&P 500\n\n(The revenue of the 40 largest firms was in excess of $1.65 Trillion, or 88% of the total revenue generated by all 98 financial firms comprising the S&P 500 financial sector.)\n\nLike all businesses, these companies are driven by the needs of increasing corporate profitability, on an annual basis, regardless of market conditions.\n\nThe Conflict Arises\n\nWhen it comes to Wall Street profitability, the most lucrative transactions are not coming from servicing \u201cMom and Pop\u201d retail clients trying to save their way into retirement.\n\nWall Street is not \u201cinvested\u201d along with you, but \u201cuses you\u201d to generate income.\n\nThis is why \u201cbuy and hold\u201d investment strategies are so widely promoted. As long as your dollars are invested the mutual funds, stocks, ETF\u2019s, etc, brokerage firms collect fees regardless of what happens in the market. These strategies are certainly in their best interest \u2013 just not necessarily yours.\n\nHowever, those retail management fees are a \u201crounding error\u201d compared to the really big money.\n\nWall Street\u2019s real clients are multi-million, and billion, dollar investment banking transactions, such as public offerings, mergers, acquisitions and bond offerings which generate hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in fees for Wall Street each year.\n\nYou know, companies like Uber (NYSE: ), Lyft (NASDAQ: ), Snapchat, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and WeWork.\n\nFor Wall Street firms to \u201cwin\u201d that very lucrative business, they must cater to their prospective clients. Not surprisingly, it is difficult for a firm to gain investment banking business from a company they have a \u201csell\u201d rating on. This is why \u201cbuy\u201d ratings are so prevalent versus \u201chold\u201d or \u201csell,\u201d as it keeps the client happy. I have compiled a chart of 4642 rated stocks ranked by the number of \u201cBuy\u201d, \u201cHold\u201d or \u201cSell.\u201d\n\nAverage Broker Rating On 4642 Issues\n\nThere are just 2.8% of all stocks with a \u201csell\u201d rating.\n\nDo you believe that out of 4642 rated companies, only 129 should be \u201csold?\u201d\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t.\n\nBut for Wall Street, a \u201csell\u201d rating is not good for business.\n\nThe conflict doesn\u2019t end just at Wall Street\u2019s pocketbook. Companies depend on their stock prices rising as it is a huge part of executive compensation packages.\n\nCorporations apply pressure on Wall Street firms, and their analysts, to ensure positive research reports on their companies with the threat that they will take their business to another \u201cfriendlier\u201d firm. This is also why up to 40% of corporate earnings reports are \u201cfudged\u201d to produce better outcomes.\n\nAs the Associated Press exposed in \u201cExperts Worry That Phony Numbers Are Misleading Investors:\u201d\n\n\u201cThose record profits that companies are reporting may not be all they\u2019re cracked up to be.\n\nAs the stock market climbs ever higher, professional investors are warning that companies are presenting misleading versions of their results that ignore a wide variety of normal costs of running a business to make it seem like they\u2019re doing better than they really are.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, the financial analysts who are supposed to fight corporate spin are often playing along. Instead of challenging the companies, they\u2019re largely passing along the rosy numbers in reports recommending stocks to investors.\u201c\n\nWhere Do You Rank\n\nStill think Wall Street might be looking out for you?\n\nIn a study by Lawrence Brown, Andrew Call, Michael Clement, and Nathan Sharp it is clear that Wall Street analysts are not that interested in you. The study surveyed analysts from the major Wall Street firms to try and understand what went on behind closed doors when research reports were being put together. In an interview with the researchers John Reeves and Llan Moscovitz wrote:\n\n\u201cCountless studies have shown that the forecasts and stock recommendations of sell-side analysts are of questionable value to investors. As it turns out, Wall Street sell-side analysts aren\u2019t primarily interested in making accurate stock picks and earnings forecasts. Despite the attention lavished on their forecasts and recommendations, predictive accuracy just isn\u2019t their main job.\u201d\n\nThe chart below is from the survey conducted by the researchers which shows the main factors that play into analysts compensation. It is quite clear that what analysts are \u201cpaid\u201d to do is quite different than what retail investors \u201cthink\u201d they do.\n\nMain Factors That Play Into Analysts Compensation\n\n\u201cSharp and Call told us that ordinary investors, who may be relying on analysts\u2019 stock recommendations to make decisions, need to know that accuracy in these areas is \u2018not a priority.\u2019 One analyst told the researchers:\n\n\u2018The part to me that\u2019s shocking about the industry is that I came into the industry thinking [success] would be based on how well my stock picks do. But a lot of it ends up being \u201cWhat are your broker votes?\u201d\u2018\n\nA \u2018broker vote\u2019 is an internal process whereby clients of the sell-side analysts\u2019 firms assess the value of their research and decide which firms\u2019 services they wish to buy. This process is crucial to analysts because good broker votes result in revenue for their firm. One analyst noted that broker votes \u2018directly impact my compensation and directly impact the compensation of my firm.'\u201d\n\nThe question really becomes then \u201cIf the retail client is not the focus of the firm then who is?\u201d The survey table below clearly answers that question.\n\nSurvey\n\nYep, there you are.\n\nAt the bottom of the list.\n\nThe incestuous relationship between companies, institutional clients, and Wall Street is the root cause of the ongoing problems within the financial system. It is a closed loop that is portrayed to be a fair and functional system; however, in reality, it has become a \u201cmoney grab\u201d that has corrupted not only the system but the regulatory agencies that are supposed to oversee it.\n\nWhy You Need Independence\n\nSo, where can you go to get \u201creal investment advice\u201dand a true consideration of the value of YOUR money?\n\nThankfully, starting at the turn of the century, the rise of independent, fee-only, financial advisers, private investment analysts, research, and rating firms began to infiltrate the system.\n\nHere is an example of the difference.\n\nAs an independent money manager, I use valuation analysis to determine what equities should be bought, sold or held in client\u2019s portfolios. While there are many measures of valuation, two of my favorites are Price to Sales and the Piotroski f-score among others. I then sorted the entire Zacks Research equity universe of 4867 issues and ranked them by these two measures.\n\nValuation Ranking On 4867 Issues\n\nSee the difference. Not surprisingly, there are far fewer \u201cbuy\u201d rated, and far more \u201csell\u201d rated, companies than what is suggested by Wall Street analysts.\n\nHere is something even more alarming.\n\nJust after the \u201cdot.com\u201d bust, I wrote a valuation article quoting Scott McNeely, who was the CEO of Sun Microsystems at the time. At its peak the stock was trading at 10x its sales. (Price-to-Sales ratio) In a Bloomberg interview Scott made the following point.\n\n\u201cAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company.\n\nThat assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees.That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate.\n\nNow, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes.\n\nWhat were you thinking?\n\nHow many of the following \u201cBuy\u201d rated companies do you own that are carrying price-to-sales valuations in excess of 10x?\n\nPrice-To-Sales Valuations In Excess Of 10x\n\nSo, what are you thinking?\n\nAs more and more \u201cbaby boomers\u201d head into retirement the need for firms that can do organic research, analysis, and make investment decisions free from \u201cconflict,\u201d which are also in the client\u2019s best interest, will continue to be in high demand in the years to come.\n\nThis is particularly the case when the next downturn occurs and the dangers of passive ETF indexing and robo-advisors are readily exposed.\n\nIndependent advice can help remove those emotional biases from the investing process that lead to poor investment outcomes over time. There are a raft of advisers with the right team, tools, and data, who can spend the time necessary to manage portfolios, monitor trends, adjust allocations, and protect capital through risk management.\n\nThe next time someone tells you that you can\u2019t \u201crisk manage\u201d your portfolio and just have to \u201cride things out,\u201d just remember, you don\u2019t.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Lance Roberts covering: Tesla Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, LYFT Inc.
