Today, the Trump administration will move to ease rules designed three decades ago to prevent fraud and bribery by doctors, but which now can hinder their efforts to improve patient care.\n\nIn a move long sought by doctors and hospitals, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will propose updates to two longstanding statutes banning physicians from referring patients for other medical services if it would financially benefit them. Officials say the laws are still important but were designed with the 1990s medical system in mind \u2013 not today\u2019s system, where health providers are increasingly being paid for the quality of their care and how well they coordinate a patient\u2019s care with other providers.\n\nAzar and other top health officials said they plan to loosen a heavy web of regulations on doctors and hospitals resulting from the federal \u201cStark\u201d law and the Anti-Kickback Statute. These regulations are getting in the way of health providers trying to work more closely together to provide better, more coordinated care for Medicare patients. Health providers currently get paid for each test they order or service they perform.\n\n\u201cOur goal here is for patients to have a sense of ease in health care, where they know providers have the right incentive to move them through the system,\u201d Azar said.\n\nThese proposed rules are highly technical \u2013 but they underscore a broader effort by the Trump administration to improve how health providers in the United States are paid for medical care. This was a top priority under the Obama administration, and Azar has stressed he is also keeping payment reform at the top of his to-do list.\n\nIt\u2019s also an effort with strong bipartisan support at a time when the administration is seen as overtly political when it comes to health-care policy. Any day now, a federal appeals court is expected to rule on a lawsuit trying to dismantle all of Obamacare. Democrat-led states have stepped up to defend the law, because the administration won\u2019t.\n\nAdministration officials are instead trying to draw attention to other steps they\u2019re taking to improve health care in the United States, including reforming Medicare payments for dialysis patients and boosting popular private plans that provide Medicare benefits.\n\n\u201cThe president and his administration are committed to fixing broken systems that don\u2019t work for the American people,\u201d said Joe Grogan, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. \u201cThe president\u2019s health vision for America is comprehensive and goes far beyond reforms for the individual market.\n\nPresident Trump speaks to the press before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on October 4. (Photo by Tom Brenner for The Washington Post)\n\nBut even as Grogan and other officials detailed the proposed wonky Stark and anti-kickback changes, they threw in several jabs at Medicare-for-all ideas pushed by Democratic presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cWhile many Democrats are focused on Medicare-for-all \u2013 which will ultimately end up becoming Medicare for none, the president is focused on protecting care for our nation\u2019s seniors,\u201d Grogan said.\n\nThe proposals the administration is releasing apply only to the Medicare program. But, like all of Medicare policy, they would likely have ripple effects throughout the entire health-care system.\n\nIt\u2019s been 30 years since Congress passed the Stark law. Its aim was to halt self-serving behavior by physicians by banning them from referring patients for tests, specialty care or other procedures that could financially benefit the doctors or their families.\n\nThis practice of self-referral can result in unnecessay testing and procedures for patients, raise overall health-care spending and compromise the trust patients place in their doctors to provide them with unbiased advice.\n\nBut things have changed since then. Many doctors and hospitals are entering into special financial arrangements where they get rewarded for working together and cutting down on unnecessary procedures. In this environment, extremely strict Stark and anti-trust regulations are viewed as unnecessary, since the providers in these arrangements don't get extra compensation anymore for providing extra services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely time for an update,\u201d Mark McClellan, who led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under former President George W. Bush, told me.\n\nAzar and Grogan gave some examples of services that could currently be considered violations of Stark and anti-kickback regulations:\n\n--A diabetes patient is admitted to the hospital for an emergency related to their disease. When they\u2019re discharged, the hospital wants to provide them with remote monitoring of their blood sugar \u2013 provided by a diabetes care company \u2013 to help prevent another hospitalization.\n\n--A doctor wants to give a patient with many different medical conditions a \u201csmart pillbox\u201d \u2013 provided by a medical device manufacturer -- that notifies them of when to take various medications.\n\nIn both examples, the providers would be viewed as benefiting financially from the provision of medical devices or services for the patients\n\nAzar said the regulations \u2013 which won\u2019t be finalized until after a public comment period \u2013 will create new exemptions from these laws for doctors and hospitals who are being paid based on quality not quantity. He said the regulations will also update existing exemptions and clarify the rules \u201cso providers can spend less time and money on compliance.\u201d\n\nCMS Administrator Seema Verma said the changes will encourage more doctors and hospitals to participate in Medicare\u2019s experiments to improve payments (she previewed this effort in a speech last spring).\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the looming threat of liability under the Stark law has discouraged many providers from entering into value-based arrangements in the first place,\u201d she said. \u201cTimes have changed and so must our approach.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he was \u201cdumb\u201d to ignore his symptoms before the heart attack he suffered a week ago. He acknowledged he will have to pull back on what has been a breakneck campaign pace because of his health, our Post colleague Chelsea Janes reports.\n\n\u201cDuring this campaign, I\u2019ve been doing in some cases three or four rallies a day, running all over the state \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever,\u201d Sanders said, speaking outside his home in Burglinton, Vt. \u201cAnd yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d he told reporters after returning from a visit to a cardiologist.\n\nIt was the first time the Vermont senator has been candid about the experience. He has spent the last few days at his Burlington home, recovering from his heart attack. Last Tuesday, he was taken to a hospital after feeling chest pains, and doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery.\n\n\u201cSanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at \u2018the appropriate time,\u2019\u201d Chelsea writes. \u201cFormer vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls \u2014 have also committed to releasing their medical records.\u201d\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention logo at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta.

The number of reported syphilis cases is climbing after being largely on the decline since 1941, and gonorrhea rates are now increasing.\u201d\n\n(iStock)\n\nOUCH: New data from the CDC found a large percentage of pregnant women are not getting two vaccines that public health officials encourage: the flu vaccine and pertussis-containing vaccine, called Tdap, which is packaged with tetanus and diptheria vaccines, Stat\u2019s Helen Branswell reports.\n\nAn online survey taken over a two-week period last spring found 55 percent of pregnant women received a Tdap vaccine during pregnancy and 54 percent got a flu shot. It also found just 35 percent received both.\n\n\u201cGetting these vaccines protects pregnant women. But the antibodies that are passed to the developing fetus protect their babies after birth as well, when they are too young to be vaccinated,\u201d Helen writes. \u201cBabies get their first shot of pertussis-containing vaccine at 2 months and can\u2019t be vaccinated against flu until they are 6 months old.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CDC report, between the 2010 and 2018 flu seasons, pregnant women were between a quarter and third of flu-related hospitalizations for women of childbearing ages.\n\nAnne Schuchat, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said health care providers can encourage vaccinations. \u201cI do think it\u2019s pretty common in pregnancy for women to wonder \u2018Well, should I do that? Is that OK? I thought I wasn\u2019t supposed to do anything,\u2019\u201d she told Helen. \u201cSo the voice of the clinician can be very powerful: \u2018Yes, I do think it\u2019s important to do, it\u2019s safe to do, it\u2019s effective.\u2019\u201d\n\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\n\n\u2014 Four school systems have sued e-cigarette company Juul for allegedly targeting teenagers and contributing to a vaping crisis that is now leaching resources from schools and educators, our Post colleague Moriah Balingit reports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tired of companies that just want to make money at children\u2019s expense,\u201d said Whitney Meissner, superintendent of the tiny La Conner School District north of Seattle. The district filed a lawsuit on Monday. Three other districts that have sued Juul are Olathe Public Schools in Kansas, Three Village Central School District in New York and Francis Howell School District in Missouri.\n\n\u201cThe lawsuits come as officials struggle to contain an outbreak of mysterious illnesses and deaths linked to vaping \u2014 although most cases involved patients who vaped THC, the active ingredient in marijuana,\u201d Moriah writes. The school districts argue the company purposefully marketed to teenagers by making products that would be popular among youth.\n\nShe adds: \u201cJuul did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits, but in the past it has defended its products by saying they were designed to help adult smokers quit. The company also has shut down social media accounts and stopped sales of flavored products to retail outlets in an effort to curb teen use.\u201d\n\nA Dick's Sporting Goods store in Daly City, Calif.

In the past year and a half, Dick\u2019s has overhauled its gun sales policies, most recently pulling all guns out of 125 stores,\u201d she writes. He also said the company\u2019s firearms category is under \u201cstrategic review.\u201d\n\nCurrently, 200 of its 730 stores don\u2019t sell any firearms at all.\n\nIn an interview with Rachel, Stack also criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for inaction on House-passed legislation to require background checks on gun purchases. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he seems afraid to take it up,\" he said.\n\nCars pass Purdue Pharma headquarters in Stamford, Conn. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File)\n\n\u2014 Arizona is now raising objections after initially supporting a nationwide opioid settlement with OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma. It's alleging the company looked to \u201cundermine material terms of the deal,\u201d our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports.\n\nLast month, Purdue reached a tentative agreement proposal that 24 states accepted \u2014 but 24 states and the District of Columbia had opposed the deal.\n\n\u201cArizona did not declare its opposition to the deal. But in objecting to a stay of opioid litigation against Purdue Pharma and the billionaire Sackler family, which owns the company, the state\u2019s attorney general is throwing a monkey wrench into a key element of the proposal,\u201d Christopher writes. \u201c \u2026 If Arizona were to withdraw its support, that would mean a majority of states oppose the tentative pact. Oklahoma and Kentucky have settled with Purdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt nearly every turn during the course of subsequent negotiations, debtors have sought to undermine material terms of the deal,\u2019\u2019 Arizona wrote in a motion filed this week.\n\n\u2014 And here are a few more good reads:\n\nJ&J Hit With $8 Billion Jury Award Over Antipsychotic Drug A Philadelphia jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $8 billion in damages to a man who said his use of J&J\u2019s antipsychotic Risperdal caused enlarged breasts.
