The end of the world was near. Very near. Today, there is a new religious narrative, especially among young people, with a new \u201cend of the world\u201d scenario. But this one is depressing and grim, with nothing redemptive about it.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the new religion of manmade global warning.\n\nIt has it unique gods (like Mother Earth).\n\nIt deifies the created world (with seminarians confessing to plants in a chapel service).\n\nIt has its high priests and religious leaders (the climate change gurus and radical environmentalists).\n\nIt has its patron saints (like Sweden\u2019s Greta Thunberg).\n\nAnd it has its own doomsday scenario: The end of the world is near. Very near.\n\nTo be clear, I do not have the credentials to comment on scientific questions related to global warming.\n\nBut I do have the credentials to comment on the effect that environmental activists are having on our culture, especially the younger generation.\n\nAn Australian website offers counsel to help people (especially young people) deal with stress and anxiety related to climate change. It notes that, \u201cThere are lots of reasons why young people might feel stressed about climate change.\u201d\n\nThese reasons include: 1) They feel like planning for the future is hopeless. 2) They are angry that the people around them aren\u2019t doing anything to help. 3) They are frustrated that there\u2019s nothing they can do now to change things. 4) They are worried about whether it\u2019s responsible to have children. 5) They feel like everything is out of their control.\n\nA May 2 headline on Science News for Students states, \u201cClimate change poses mental health risks to children and teens.\u201d\n\nAnd a September 19 article on Conversation.com warned that, \u201cIgnoring young people\u2019s climate change fears is a recipe for anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as far back as 2016, the American Psychological Association (APA) claimed that, \u201cClimate change is threatening mental health. A federal report that tapped psychologists' expertise outlines the ways climate change affects us all.\u201d\n\nBut herein lies the rub. It is not \u201cclimate change\u201d that is \u201cthreatening mental health.\u201d It is the apocalyptic way it is being reported that is threatening mental health.\n\nAfter all, when I was told in 1971 that Jesus was coming back soon, it was an exciting prospect. The end of the age is fast approaching and we will be with the Lord forever! This world is falling apart, but God will come to redeem us!\n\nBut there is no such hope in today\u2019s gloom and doom climate change reporting. Instead, it produces fear and provokes frustration, especially for young people: \u201cOur world is being destroyed, and you\u2019re not doing anything about it! Don\u2019t you care?\u201d\n\nTo quote Greta Thunberg directly, \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. . . . We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth - how dare you!\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason for her fears.\n\nAn October, 2018 headline proclaimed: \u201cWe have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, warns UN.\u201d\n\nSix months later, in March, 2019, the UN website echoed these sentiments: \u201cOnly 11 Years Left to Prevent Irreversible Damage from Climate Change, Speakers Warn during General Assembly High-Level Meeting. Ambition, Urgency Needed to Address Global Emergency, Secretary-General Says.\u201d\n\nNo wonder teenaged Greta and her generation are up in arms. No wonder they are so stressed. No wonder they are angry. \u201cIt is your policies and your greed and your selfishness that have stolen our future!\u201d\n\nAs reported on September 26, \u201cAround climate-change protests, tears linger. Youthful activists cite all-too depressing science and develop angst. They grieve for a future they worry they\u2019ll never have.\n\n\u201cMany young climate activists say they feel hopeless and overwhelmed. . . . \u2018It's really hard to grow up on a planet full of ifs,\u2019 said This is Zero Hour co-founder Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old from Seattle, who is finding hard to buckle down and apply to colleges. \u2018There's always been a sense that everything beautiful in this world is temporary for my generation.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow very, very sad \u2013 but not because it\u2019s all true.\n\nInstead, as John Nolte pointed out, \u201cFor more than 50 years Climate Alarmists in the scientific community and environmental movement have not gotten even one prediction correct, but they do have a perfect record of getting 41 predictions wrong.\n\n\u201cIn other words, on at least 41 occasions, these so-called experts have predicted some terrible environmental catastrophe was imminent \u2026 and it never happened.\u201d\n\nConsequently, he asks, \u201cWhy would we completely restructure our economy and sacrifice our personal freedom for \u2018experts\u2019 who are 0-41, who have never once gotten it right?\u201d\n\nSo, young people are being stressed about something that may never happen. They are growing up waiting for the shoe to drop, not being able to enjoy because of fear for tomorrow.\n\nThe innocence of youth is being robbed from them, and everyone is to blame. Yet an article on the Teaching Tolerance website urges that, \u201cTeachers\u2019 Silence on Climate Change Violates Students\u2019 Rights.\u201d\n\nI would urge instead that there needs to be a lot of soul searching and circumspection, from our children\u2019s educators to the popular media. Are you sure the information you are sharing is accurate? Are you positive the fears you are instilling are warranted? Are you certain that you are not playing with the emotions of impressionable young people?\n\nFrom my perspective (and leaning into my areas of expertise), I would rather say this: It\u2019s true that this world will not endure forever. One day, Jesus will return and make a new heaven and earth. So, live your life here with passion, in expectation of His return, making every moment count. That way, whether you live to be 100 or if He comes back in 10 years, your life will be full and blessed.\n\nI challenge a climate change religionist to come up with a better message than that.", "description": "When I came to faith as a 16-year-old, drug-using, hippie .10/03/2019 3:18:45AM EST.", "authors": ["Michael Brown", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/1061e122-f92b-48c0-897f-ebbda402fb55.png"}
