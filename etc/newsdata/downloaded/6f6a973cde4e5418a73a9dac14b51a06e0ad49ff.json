The Nationals\u2019 veteran right-hander is making the biggest start of his life one year removed from one of the worst seasons of his career. Strasburg rebounded from a difficult, injury-riddled 2018 to become the most dominant and durable he\u2019s ever been this year. His dominant Game 2 performance \u2014 six innings, no walks, 10 strikeouts, one earned run \u2014 nosed down his postseason ERA to 0.64, the best mark in MLB history for anyone with four or more postseason starts.\n\nBuehler will not be easy to out-duel. The 25-year-old right-hander has not allowed a run in his last 17\u2154 postseason innings. He blanked the Nationals in Game 1 over six innings and allowed just one hit. The Nationals will tell you they chased pitches out of the zone and took a questionable offensive approach in Game 1, but they need actualize those adjustments in Game 5 to escape with their first-ever playoff series win.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGame information\n\nWashington Nationals at Los Angeles Dodgers (series tied 2-2)\n\nWhen: Wednesday, 8:37 p.m.\n\nWhere: Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles\n\nStarting pitchers: Stephen Strasburg (18-6, 3.32 ERA) vs. Walker Buehler (14-4, 3.26 ERA)\n\nLineups\n\nNationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nKurt Suzuki C\n\nMichael A.

In his second season, Soto relies less and less on interpreters. He always responds in English. He does one-on-one interviews on his own, usually with familiar reporters, and once joked: \u201cIf you\u2019re okay with rephrasing your questions, I\u2019m okay with doing my best to answer.\u201d (Read more)\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Los Angeles ended Washington's season in Game 5 of the NLDS in 2016.
