But what exactly is it?\n\nWhat we are witnessing is another round in the same historic struggle that powered the English civil war of the 17th century: the contest between the executive and the legislature. At its simplest, the House of Commons has voted \u2013 once again \u2013 to take control of the Brexit process, in order to prevent the UK crashing out of the European Union with no deal on 31 October. That\u2019s the substance of the bill that MPs will vote on, and are likely to pass, today, having cleared the procedural hurdle in dramatic fashion last night. The comparisons with the 17th century are not hyperbolic, because what this move represents is a bid by the legislature \u2013 parliament \u2013 to grab powers that have traditionally been the preserve of the executive.\n\nBoris Johnson's blustering strategy has fallen at the first hurdle | Tom Kibasi Read more\n\nThat contest is not over. If MPs succeed today, they will have decided \u2013 against the wishes of Boris Johnson \u2013 to seek an extension of Britain\u2019s EU membership until 31 January 2020, if no exit agreement has been secured before then.\n\nJohnson has said he will refuse to act on MPs\u2019 wishes, that he will simply not request such an extension from Brussels. To avoid the MPs\u2019 instruction, he would rather empty out the current House of Commons and have a general election to fill a new one, one more sympathetic to his aims. But that can only happen if MPs allow it, by voting for it. Under the current rules, he needs two-thirds of the Commons to agree to an early election and Labour has said it won\u2019t do it \u2013 fearing a ruse that would allow Johnson to crash out of the EU during an election campaign.\n\nIn other words, parliament is asserting itself and its rights, refusing to be pushed around by an overmighty executive (in the form of Johnson this time, rather than Charles I). Indeed, I\u2019m told that MPs are pondering a means to ensure their will is done over the head of the prime minister: one senior opposition figure has a bill ready that would mandate the Speaker, John Bercow, to apply to Brussels himself for that extension on behalf of the British parliament.\n\nThere\u2019s a deep paradox here. It was the champions of Brexit who back in 2016 posed as the defenders of parliamentary sovereignty, determined to reassert the supremacy and independence of the Commons from the supposed encroachments of Brussels. Yet here they are now, fighting parliament at every turn: first proroguing, or suspending, parliament for five weeks; then expelling MPs from their party, even those with decades of devoted service; now seeking to defy parliament\u2019s will. It\u2019s quite a reverse, one captured well by that photograph of the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, stretching out contemptuously on the Commons frontbench.\n\nThis is not the only revolutionary upheaval under way. Something of that order is currently convulsing the Tory party. A purge that expels two former chancellors and a man who a matter of weeks ago was a candidate for the leadership is an epochal event for the Conservative party. It is changing shape, refashioned by Johnson into the Brexit party by another name \u2013 a nationalist, populist party of the hard right.\n\nThere is some debate over whether all this \u2013 the prorogation, the expulsions \u2013 is a series of improvised moves born of panic or, on the contrary, a cunning plan. Within that question is a related one: is the PM\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, an evil genius or what Marina Hyde calls a \u201ccrap svengali\u201d? One of the victims of the Tory purge \u2013 Tory grandee and Churchill\u2019s grandson Nicholas Soames \u2013 told BBC Newsnight he believes this is all very deliberate. The assumption is that Cummings is intentionally baiting MPs so that he can trigger an election that Johnson will then cast as a populist battle of \u201cpeople v parliament\u201d.\n\nIf that\u2019s right, it is surely the most high-risk electoral strategy ever attempted in this country. It knowingly alienates moderate Tory voters who have always quite liked, say, Ken Clarke, thereby writing off a string of seats \u2013 in the south and the West Country \u2013 that are likely to fall to the Liberal Democrats. It similarly dooms the Tories in Scotland. So Johnson will begin the next election campaign with that immediate handicap. The Cummings plan is to make up for those lost seats, and gain many more, by winning pro-leave seats in the Midlands and north of England, many of them Labour-held, chiefly by neutralising the Brexit party. Why vote for Nigel Farage when you can get a no-deal, full-monty Brexit with Johnson?\n\nThe Brexit ultras cheer him, but the Boris Johnson pantomime will end | Rafael Behr Read more\n\nThe trouble with that is, there are plenty of onetime Labour voters who were happy to vote leave in 2016, happy even to vote for Farage in May\u2019s European elections, who may nevertheless balk at voting Tory. Still, Cummings and Johnson are gambling on the belief that they can burn down every other plank of historic Tory support, but win power by delighting the hardcore Brexit base. Win the 35%, enrage everyone else.\n\nA few weeks from now we might be watching a triumphant Johnson returned to Downing Street with a healthy majority, forced to applaud the strategic genius of Dominic Cummings. Or we might marvel that a man who inherited a precarious political situation went on a rampage of revolutionary destruction, thereby making that situation much, much worse.\n\n\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Proroguing parliament, expelling MPs: are these moves born of panic or all part of a cunning plan, asks Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland", "authors": ["Jonathan Freedland"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14378ad42fb731858f9d04d77001a56f3715c91a/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9cd943a7c86490445647fb1c3f2ccbe6"}
