In a fiery back-and-forth with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd, Johnson reversed the stance he held at a constituent event in his home state on Friday.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Trump blocked Johnson in August from telling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that US aid was on its way, at the same time that the president was appealing to Zelensky to investigate his potential 2020 contender Joe Biden.\n\nSen.

Now, I didn't succeed.\"\n\nOn \"Meet the Press,\" Johnson instead pushed a conspiracy theory that members of the FBI and CIA are conspiring to bring down Trump with investigations into his conduct and that the press was pushing a false narrative that Trump was digging up dirt on his 2020 opponent.\n\nRead more: There's a second Trump-Ukraine whistleblower and this one has first-hand knowledge of the allegations\n\nIn a heated exchange, Todd called Johnson's arguments \"Fox News conspiracy theories\" and said \"Please answer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you're not criticizing him [...] What made you wince?\"\n\n\"Because I didn't want those connected,\" Johnson replied, referring to the withholding of military aid and the appeal to investigate the 2016 election. \"But here's the salient point of why I came forward. When I asked the president about that, he completely denied it. He adamantly denied it, he vehemently, angrily denied it.\"\n\nJohnson also previously told The Wall Street Journal that a US ambassador to the EU said Trump's withholding of aid to Ukraine was directly connected to his interest in having Kiev, Ukraine's capital, investigate certain matters \u2013 which Trump denied.\n\nWatch the full exchange below:", "description": "Senator Ron Johnson initially added to the speculation about whether Trump engaged in a quid pro quo concerning Ukraine, then reversed his stance.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9a2b575d21aa280420ae3c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
