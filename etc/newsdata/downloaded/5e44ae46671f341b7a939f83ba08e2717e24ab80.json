The pain becomes worse and worse. It makes even walking painful. Afterwards I get so itchy.\n\n'It's difficult because you feel aroused and you want to do something about it, but when you do the pain is so intense.\n\n'If I tried to masturbate, I would get sharp stabbing pains around my clitoris, and if I would try to walk I would be in so much pain. I would have to hold an ice bag down there.\n\nThe former care assistant's condition leaves her with agonizing muscle spasms in her pelvis that can last up to four days\n\n'My relationship with my husband has been difficult and I have a lot of insecurities. Because we don't have intercourse often, I do have insecurities about whether or not he would cheat on me.\n\n'He's a good man, he married me knowing the issues I have and the barriers that creates for sex.\n\n'We have sex once or twice a year, but I do it for my husband, I have to have a couple of drinks to get through it. It hurts, it feels like I've been hit by a truck.'\n\nNatalie believes her condition stems from a car accident in 2002, during which she she injured her pudendal nerve, which is responsible for carrying messages from the external genitalia.\n\nAlthough she appeared uninjured, Natalie experienced recurrent thrush and sex with Robert, who was then her boyfriend, began to cause pain.\n\nNatalie suffered with the condition's symptoms for more than a decade before she was officially diagnosed with pudendal neuralgia in 2014.\n\nNatalie said that her relationship with her husband has been difficult and she has a lot of insecurities due to her condition\n\nIn 2017, Natalie gave up her career as a care assistant for people with special needs as the pain became too unbearable and she was unable to get through a working day\n\nShe said: 'I was involved in a car accident in 2002 where I believe all my issues began. I think I pinched a nerve and a month later I began suffering persistent urinary tract infections and intercourse started to hurt. I couldn't do it without pain.\n\n'I could no longer even wear a tampon without pain.\n\n'I was in a relationship at the time with my boyfriend, who is now my husband. But after this accident, I couldn't have intercourse which put pressure on my relationship with him.\n\n'My chronic pain has been progressive. Over the last four or five years it has become worse.\n\n'During that time my dog knocked me over onto my butt and I began experiencing rectal pains.\n\nNatalie believes her condition stems from a car accident she has in 2002. During the accident she injured her pudendal nerve, which is linked to the bladder, the rectum and vagina\n\n'Now after every bowel movement I experience pain. I have seen many doctors about this. I have seen pelvic pain specialists to psychiatrists. It makes you feel really horrible when people suggest it is all in your mind.\n\n'I didn't get officially diagnosed with PGAD until last year.'\n\nIn 2017, Natalie was forced to give up her career as a care assistant for people with special needs as she could no longer adequately manage her pain to get through the work day.\n\n'I was so fatigued and I would have intense pain every time I had a bowel movement,' she said.\n\nThe former care assistant (pictured at her high school graduation) said her chronic pain has been progressive over the last four or five years\n\n'I was taking a strong painkiller at work to deal with it and if I had to go, the pain and the anxiety would set in.\n\n'I began to have panic attacks. It was a very rewarding role and I was devastated to leave my job but I couldn't do it anymore.'\n\nSince her diagnosis, Natalie has undergone several treatments to help relieve her pain, including pudendal Botox injections and an injection to block messages to the pudendal nerve which have provided minor relief.\n\nNatalie(pictured with ice on her genitals during one of her episodes) now takes injections for her condition\n\nNatalie now works with a pelvic floor specialist to help work through her condition and build up new coping mechanisms for pain.\n\nShe continued: 'The pudendal nerve is linked to the bladder, the rectum, and vagina so when you block it, it can provide minor relief. My attacks are about 48 hours now, rather than four days.\n\n'Since the injections my life has gotten better. I can live my life without a fear of an attack.\n\n'I can go for a daily walk. I can actually leave the house and run errands.\n\n'I've been working on retraining my mind and body which has had a positive effect on me.\n\n'I have been working with a psychotherapist and journaling has been really helpful for me. I've been trying to get my repressed emotions from my childhood down on paper.'\n\nNatalie, who dreams of having a family with her supportive husband Robert, says her chronic condition has made their path to parenthood more difficult.\n\nShe added: 'I always wanted children with my husband and have been through IVF. But my condition has meant it's been more difficult. My husband has a condition also which means we can only conceive through IVF, but because I've been unwell we haven't tried again.\n\nNatalie, who now works with a pelvic floor specialist to help work through her condition, and Robert both go to marriage counselling to help them through their difficulties\n\n'If it doesn't work out we might consider fostering or adopting.'\n\nWhile Natalie's condition has been tough on her marriage, she says she is extremely lucky to have such a supportive partner in Robert.\n\nShe said: 'He's such a good man, he married me knowing the issues I have and the barriers that creates for sex and I love him for that.\n\n'We go to marriage counselling and it's the only reason we are still together.\n\n'I feel like I'm missing out on a part of my life and I just have to hope that things will one day get better.'\n\nRobert added: 'I married Natalie when I knew we would have these issues because I am an eternal optimist.\n\n'I love her so much and I didn't want to give up the opportunity to be with her forever, when this is something that might be resolved or managed at some point in our lives. I have hope that we're always one doctor away.'", "description": "Natalie Bricker, 35, of Newark, Delaware, who was diagnosed with persistent genital arousal disorder in 2018, avoids sex with her husband Robert Bricker, 38, due to her painful condition.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/10/19650296-0-image-a-17_1570958359250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
