During that call, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential political rival in the 2020 campaign.\n\nGiuliani was served with a subpoena earlier this week, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is under subpoena to produce documents about State Department officials\u2019 communications with Giuliani.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pompeo sent a letter to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) accusing House Democrats of trying to bully and intimidate him and other senior State Department officials with a broad request for information related to Trump\u2019s efforts to solicit foreign help in investigating Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nPompeo indicated that he would not comply with Engel\u2019s subpoena, which has a Friday deadline and was issued in conjunction with the Intelligence and Oversight panels.\n\nPompeo also said a proposed schedule of depositions with current and former State Department officials was \u201cnot feasible.\u201d But at least two of them \u2014 former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and former U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker \u2014 will appear for their depositions, according to a congressional aide. Volker\u2019s interview is still scheduled for Thursday, while Yovanovitch will appear on Oct. 11.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Pompeo confirmed news reports that he listened in on Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky. The conversation is the subject of a whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration initially withheld from the congressional intelligence committees.\n\nThe timing of Pelosi\u2019s news conference was unusual given that it came during a scheduled two-week congressional recess. But it reflects an effort by Democratic leaders to help rank-and-file lawmakers \u2014 in particular, moderates and those who come from GOP-leaning districts \u2014 craft a consistent message as House investigators press forward with an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi and her leadership team have promised regular caucus calls over the break to ensure Democrats are kept in the loop about ongoing developments. There\u2019s a caucus call planned for Wednesday afternoon at the same time Trump is scheduled to hold a press conference at the White House.\n\nOn a call with the caucus on Sunday, Pelosi and other senior Democrats laid out their strategy to win the impeachment messaging war: repeatedly hammer Trump\u2019s alleged misdeeds and avoid getting distracted by trying to refute GOP talking points.\n\nHouse investigators could glean also new information related to their Ukraine probe later Wednesday when Steve Linick, the State Department\u2019s inspector general, briefs House and Senate committee staffers. Linick requested the briefing shortly after Pompeo\u2019s letter was released on Tuesday, saying it was an \u201curgent\u201d matter.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/21/7c/8491b38149a7b788f6df9ce44516/191002-cummings-gty-773.jpg"}
