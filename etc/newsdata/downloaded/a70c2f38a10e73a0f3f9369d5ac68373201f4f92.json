Now she's an advocate for debunking the wellness myths she fell for on social ", "language": "en", "text": "Pixie Turner once snuck out of her university lectures early to go and eat a plate of vegetables alone because she couldn't face the idea of her friends taking her out to a Chinese buffet for her birthday lunch. It was one of the stand-out moments she remembers from her time battling orthorexia, the unhealthy obsession with eating \"pure\" or \"clean\" food.\n\nAnother year, when she turned 22, her mother picked up a raw vegan birthday cake especially from London.\n\n\"I think we ate maybe half of it because we paid a lot of money for it and we felt like we had to, but it didn't taste good,\" Turner told Insider. \"It didn't taste like a chocolate cake and looking back I do wish I had a really beautiful indulgent chocolate fudge cake. That would have been so much more wonderful.\"\n\nTurner got caught up in the exponential rise of the wellness bloggersphere\n\nAbout six years ago, Turner became immersed in the world of wellness bloggers on Instagram. This was when trends like clean eating \u2014 eating predominantly raw vegetables and cutting out or dramatically restricting almost everything else \u2014 were at their peak.\n\nBefore she knew it, her Instagram account Plant Based Pixie had thousands of followers relying on her for health and nutrition advice. She was fully cemented in the elite group of wellness gurus who were taking over social media.\n\nIt started off as a trend of towards eating more fresh fruit and vegetables and less fast and junk food \u2014 so far, so healthy. It was popularized by many social media bloggers, but some of the most prominent included Ella Mills of Deliciously Ella, the Hemsley sisters, Amelia Freer, and Madeleine Shaw, who urged readers of their Instagram captions and recipe books to subscribe to a vague, desirable \"lifestyle\" of self-love and \"finding your glow.\"\n\nBut while it should have been a positive change for followers to embrace, critics of the wellness fad soon started to speak up. They said behind the dewy, envious appearance of many Instagrammers were promotions of an unhealthy, unattainable body image and masses of false information about food: gluten is bad for your gut, detox tea is your savior, and acidic food causes diseases.\n\nRead more: 5 things people get wrong about eating healthy\n\nTurner was once one of the people spreading these myths and growing a following. But while she enjoyed the comments from those who were impressed by her new health kick, she was anything but happy in real life.\n\nShe told Insider she now looks back on some of the places she used to go to eat and can't believe what she was doing.\n\n\"We used to go to these cafes in Notting Hill and Covent Garden and order these \u00a310 smoothies that had moss in them,\" she said. \"Why the fuck would I want to drink moss? It sounds absolutely disgusting. And it was. It was so unbearably disgusting but we all pretended that it was all great and we all loved it.\"\n\nAll her friends were in on the facade and would take photos for their Instagram profiles with captions about how delicious raw vegan pancakes were.\n\nA typical Instagram shot Turner would upload during her clean eating phase. Pixie Turner\n\nNow her Instagram is very different, promoting science-backed information thanks to her degree in nutrition. As she says in one post, if we were to follow every piece of ill-advised health advice on the internet, we wouldn't eat or drink anything. Including water.\n\nShe said she feels a certain level guilt towards her followers \u2014 the majority of whom have stayed despite her change of direction \u2014 because posting about healthy green juices and maca powder was misleading them.\n\n\"They were the people who needed to hear what I have to say now the most,\" she said. \"Because I felt partly responsible potentially for them believing things I told them were true that weren't.\"\n\nTurner first stopped eating meat and fish when she started her diet, then she cut out dairy and eggs, gluten, soy, and refined sugar. She was so obsessed with eating \"clean\" without any real idea of what she was, and wasn't, actually allowing into her body.\n\nShe said she had the \"wrong intentions\" right from the beginning, but she kept going because of all the time and money she had invested in it. A lot of her friends were also in the same world, so giving up the clean lifestyle would potentially mean the severing of some friendships.\n\n\"It would be letting go of that part of yourself, and it would almost be saying to yourself that all this wasn't worth it,\" she said. \"And that felt impossible at the time.\"\n\nOrthorexia comes from dramatic diet restriction under the guise of health\n\nAccording to author, therapist, and YouTuber Kati Morton, who specializes in treating people with eating disorders, orthorexia isn't a diagnosis in the DSM \u2014 one of the most widely used catalogues for defining and diagnosing mental disorders. However, it can be placed under anorexia nervosa because people who have it tend to restrict themselves so severely.\n\nSome, like Turner, limit what they eat and drink out of concern over whether it's healthy, according to fad diets or bogus studies. Others may stop themselves from eating certain foods for reasons like being incredibly environmentally aware.\n\n\"Eating disorders are just coping skills, so I don't think that it ever comes from a healthy place,\" Morton told Insider. \"Because I have loads of friends who are very eco-conscious and that doesn't stop them from eating.\"\n\nRead more: Instagram posts encouraging eating disorders are 'spiraling out of control,' psychiatrists warn\n\nBut it's not necessarily about the food, as one of the most common themes in developing an eating disorder is the inability to deal with some sort of trauma.\n\n\"It's like 'I'm going to focus so much of my energy on this I can't focus on anything else that's really upsetting me,'\" Morton said. \"It's an emotional upset we haven't given ourself time to process.\"\n\nSome people choose drinking or gambling as a way to numb themselves from what they're feeling. Some act out or go on shopping sprees. For those with eating disorders, they control their body in whatever way they can.\n\nPixie Turner when she was struggling with orthorexia. Pixie Turner\n\nFor Turner, it was a health scare that led her down the road of changing her diet.\n\n\"I was already in a vulnerable place in the sense I was worried about my health,\" she said. \"Plus I am a lifelong perfectionist, and that always makes things a little bit more difficult because you have extremely high standards and everything is black and white and if you aren't doing it perfectly you're a failure.\"\n\nIn a sense, it was a perfect storm of her heightened anxiety about her health, the exploding wellness industry, and her tendency to be a bit pedantic that sucked her in and kept her there for so long.\n\nEating disorders can be identified by how many hours a day you spend thinking about food\n\nWhat makes orthorexia particularly complicated is that there is nothing wrong with eating healthy on paper. To help decipher the difference, Morton always asks her clients: \"How much of your day are you thinking about food?\"\n\n\"Because it really shouldn't be that much,\" she said. \"You or I would say maybe one. It's very minimal. But people with eating disorders it's like 90% of their brain space.\"\n\nIf most of your thoughts throughout the day are filled with food, it starts to get in the way of your functioning, which is a major sign something is diagnostically wrong.\n\nRead more: More evidence that no best diet exists: A study of 1,100 people shows how everyone responds differently to common foods\n\n\"What I tell people to look out for is if their response to an issue with food is larger than the issue warrants,\" Morton said. \"Like if they can't know where something came from, or if it's gluten free, and they fly off the handle.\"\n\nPeople with eating disorders can get really angry if they lose that control over their food, because their way of coping is being taken away from them.\n\n\"All of the hurt or upset or whatever is going on that they're trying to mask with this is going to come out,\" she said. \"It will erupt if you don't allow them to do exactly what the eating disorder wants ... It's about control, their rituals around food, and if something isn't what they want.\"\n\nIt took a shock for Turner to realize what was going on\n\nEverything started to change for Turner when she went travelling after getting her first university degree. At home in the UK she was used to a supply of superfood powders various wellness brands had sponsored her with, but she had to rein in her expectations when backpacking around India.\n\nThis planted the seed to make her rethink whether all the foods she cut out really were as poisonous as she believed. When she reached Australia, although plenty of \"clean\" foods were readily available, she was more open to hearing another point of view.\n\n\"The big turning point, the big lightbulb moment, was when I was in a car with a bunch of wellness bloggers and one of them said, 'I would never dream of vaccinating my kids,'\" she said. \"I was so shocked they were so convinced by this, that this just seemed normal and okay, and I knew it was just so wrong and so damaging.\"\n\nRead more: An app developer claimed her diet cured her brain cancer and sold the nutrition plan to tons of consumers \u2014 now, she admits she was never sick\n\nAround the same time, Belle Gibson, the pseudoscience advocate who said she had cured her cancer through her diet, was found out to be a fraud.\n\nHearing her friends support Gibson despite the news stories first made Turner think she couldn't be associated with people who were spreading dangerous ideas. Secondly, if these were their beliefs, what else had they been wrong about?\n\n\"I started reexamining everything I thought I knew about food and about health and my diet,\" Turner said. \"And one by one all my different ideas started to fall by the wayside and I started abandoning them.\"\n\nIn 2016, Turner wrote a blog post titled \"I was wrong, and that's ok.\" She picked apart some of her old statements, like how sugar is evil and the existence of \"superfoods,\" and said her blog posts would be going in a different direction from then on.\n\nShe also thought: \"If I'm going to keep writing about this I need to have a qualification that sets me apart from these wellness bloggers.\" So she earned a masters degree in nutrition. She's also written a book called \" The Wellness Rebel.\"\n\nTurner now works with other people struggling with orthorexia, and helps them examine their views of food with exposure therapy. But she knows how difficult it can be to recognize it, especially if someone is hiding behind the veil of being hugely into wellness and health.\n\n\"When I was in the midst of it, there was nothing that would have got me out of it,\" she said. \"I couldn't say anything to 22-year-old me, she would just ignore it. There was absolutely no point in saying anything because I even thought I knew more than my GP. The audacity is just unbelievable.\"\n\nIn the end, orthorexia is obsessive, rigid, and dogmatic, she said. So if she could go back and tell her 22-year-old self anything, it would be to just go full speed in the other direction when she realized the truth.\n\nPixie Turner now has a very different relationship with food. Pixie Turner / Instagram\n\nKeep your social media healthy by purging it every 6 months\n\nIn a way, Turner is grateful for what she went through because she's ended up in a job she loves and has a real sense of purpose. But she also doesn't want anyone to think this excuses the pain she may have caused anyone who was sucked into the clean eating world as a result of her Instagram.\n\n\"I don't want people to think you have to go through something like that in order to come out the other side, because you absolutely don't have to,\" she said. \"Because it was shit, and I said some really stupid things, and that shouldn't be glamorized and made to seem like a good thing in any way.\"\n\nThe first thing Turner gets her clients to do is to remove anyone from their feeds who makes them feel bad about themselves, and replaces them with pictures of nature and animals. In fact, she recommends everyone do this at least twice a year.\n\n\"Because it's literally impossible to feel bad about yourself when you're looking at pictures of puppies,\" she said. \"Most of my Instagram has absolutely nothing to do with food any more. I follow some food magazines that post photos of beautiful cakes and things, but health-wise, not that much.\"\n\nIf you, or anyone you know, might be affected by an eating disorder, you can find help and information on the Mind or Rethink Mental Health websites.\n\nRead more: 14 of the biggest myths about nutrition and dieting, debunked", "description": "Pixie Turner is now a certified nutritionist, but a few years ago, she was sucked into the online world of wellness bloggers and restricted dieting.", "authors": ["Lindsay Dodgson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89fe2df4fc2433bd223b7a-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
