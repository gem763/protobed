REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n\nAlmost all the firms in the monthly Reuters Corporate Survey said the world\u2019s third-biggest economy will level off or fall into recession in coming months, which would mark an end to the \u201cAbenomics\u201d expansion that the premier launched in late 2012.\n\nAnd while most of the firms still don\u2019t want the Bank of Japan to increase its stimulus, that opposition has weakened sharply over the past quarter as the U.S-China trade war has clouded prospects for global growth and export-reliant Japan.\n\nAbe says the increase in the national sales tax, which he had twice delayed, is crucial to reining in the industrial world\u2019s heaviest debt burden - more than twice Japan\u2019s annual $5 trillion output. But the higher levy could cool consumer spending, triggering a recession, analysts fear.\n\nThe Reuters survey found 69% of firms expect the tax hike to weigh on growth, 26% see no impact and 5% think it could boost the economy.\n\n\u201cThe tax hike will hurt consumer sentiment considerably, which will exert an unpredictable impact on the Japanese economy,\u201d a manager at a food-processing company wrote in the survey.\n\nSome 58% expect the economy to level off heading into next year, while 41% predict a recession, the survey found. Just 1% see the economy growing after the tax increase.\n\nEconomists in a Reuters poll last month forecast the economy will grow 0.8% in the fiscal year to March, up from the 0.5% predicted a month earlier.\n\n\u201cA combination of a post-tax hike decline in demand and a sputtering global economy will clearly exert downward pressure on Japan\u2019s economy,\u201d said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.\n\nHe forecasts a recession for Japan, with the economy contracting for the two quarters through March.\n\nCompanies in the Reuters survey that expected a recession largely think it will last at least a year, with a quarter expecting it to hit bottom late next year and 56% seeing the slump dragging into 2021 or beyond.\n\nJapan\u2019s coincident economic indicator fell in August, the Cabinet Office said this week, downgrading its assessment of the key gauge to \u201cworsening,\u201d which can presage a recession. Last month the office maintained its overall assessment that the economy continues to recover moderately.\n\nThe Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted Sept. 26-Oct. 7 for Reuters by Nikkei Research, canvassed 504 big and midsize nonfinancial companies, of which 230-240 firms responded to the various questions, on condition of anonymity.\n\nBOJ STIMULUS\n\nAs the economic outlook clouds, opposition to further easing from the central bank is waning, the survey found.\n\nHaruhiko Kuroda, installed by Abe as BOJ governor six and a half years ago to spur growth and end decades of deflation, has driven the most aggressive asset purchases among major central banks, pushing some interest rates below zero.\n\nBut while Kuroda vowed to stoke inflation to 2% in two years, the BOJ has generated price rises of less than half of that, while ultra-low interest rates are hurting banks by crimping lending margins.\n\nFifty-seven percent of the companies in the survey said the BOJ should not expand its massive easing, with many concerned it could weaken financial institutions. But this response was down from 88% to a similar question in July.\n\nSome 42% of respondents said additional easing would have no effect on the economy, while the rest were split on whether more stimulus would on balance help or hurt growth.\n\n\u201cThe harmful effects of the prolonged easing are becoming clear. Going too far would cause the banking system to collapse and the negatives would become larger,\u201d wrote a manager at a machinery maker.\n\nOf those who said additional easing would be a net positive, the biggest reason, at 43%, was that lower inflation-adjusted interest rates would encourage more capital spending.\n\nIn a potentially positive development for the BOJ\u2019s aim of boosting prices, more than two-thirds of firms said they have been able to pass on the sales-tax hike to consumers in the prices of their goods and services.\n\nBut unless wages rise enough to offset the higher prices, the tax hike could erode consumer purchasing power, hurting private consumption, which makes up about 60% of the economy, analysts say.", "description": "Japanese companies overwhelmingly think the nation's longest postwar expansion is peaking, with two-thirds expecting a tax hike imposed this month by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to hurt the economy, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439479458&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A00B", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
