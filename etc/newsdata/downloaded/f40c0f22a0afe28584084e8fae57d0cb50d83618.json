But now it is fundamental to our survival and we must overcome greed, apathy and selfishness if we are to make real progress,\u201d Harry told Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph newspaper.\n\n\u201cThis may well sound hippy to some, but we cannot afford to have a \u2018them or us\u2019 mentality. Humans and animals and their habitats fundamentally need to co-exist or within the next 10 years our problems across the globe will become even more unmanageable.\u201d\n\nHarry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth, also guest-edited National Geographic magazine\u2019s Instagram account on Monday to encourage people worldwide to appreciate the value of trees, Buckingham Palace said.\n\nIn a campaign entitled \u2018Looking Up\u2019, the Duke of Sussex posted pictures taken by National Geographic\u2019s photographers - among them images from the Liwonde National Park that he was visiting - to raise awareness of trees\u2019 vital role in the Earth\u2019s eco-system.\n\nHarry has launched a number of projects under the \u201cQueen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy\u201d initiative, which has, among other things, involved planting of millions of trees in dozens of Commonwealth countries to help combat climate change.\n\nIn a speech to welcome Liwonde National Park and Mangochi Forest to the initiative, Harry praised cooperation between Malawi\u2019s rangers and British soldiers.\n\nBritain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, makes a speech during an event dedicating the Liwonde National Park and Mangochi Forest to the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy conservation initiative at Liwonde National Park, Malawi, September 30, 2019.

It also highlighted a number of local organizations that support marginalized youth and women.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harry will visit a health center, pharmacy and youth reproductive health program in Malawi. He will then rejoin Meghan and Archie in South Africa for a township visit on Wednesday near Johannesburg.\n\nThey will also meet Graca Machel, widow of South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, and President Cyril Ramaphosa before returning to London.", "description": "Britain's Prince Harry appealed on Monday in a national park in Malawi for increased global efforts to protect the environment against \"greed, apathy and selfishness\".", "authors": ["Frank Phiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435675114&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1HV", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
