Laurent Brossoit was outstanding in making 35 saves, including three in the shootout, including one by Hughes.\n\nWATCH | Jets comeback to beat Devils in a shootout\n\nWinnipeg came all the way back from a 4-0 deficit to take out New Jersey in the shootout. 1:37\n\nBlake Coleman had two goals for New Jersey, including a spectacular one-handed shot while falling down. Nilita Gusev also tallied in his first NHL game and Sami Vatanen added a goal for the Devils, while defenceman P.K. Subban had two assists.\n\nWheeler, who hit the post with the net wide open in the closing seconds of regulation, got the game winner with a backhander into the top of the net against Mackenzie Blackwood, who replaced an injured Cory Schneider early in the Jets' three-goal third period.\n\nBlake Coleman split the defence and with a man draped all over him somehow one-handed the puck into the back of the net while falling down for a spectacular goal. 0:58\n\nTrailing 4-0 in the final minute of the second period, the Jets started their comeback with 11 seconds left when Kulikov beat Schneider on a shot from the point.\n\nIt didn't seem like much until the Jets turned it on in the third period despite playing their second game in 24 hours.\n\nCory Schneider leaves game with injury\n\nRoslovic cut the lead in half, scoring on a rebound at 2:41.
