Inquiry Into Clinton Emails Finds No Deliberate Mishandling of Classified Information", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A yearslong State Department investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server found that while the use of the system for official business increased the risk of compromising classified information, there was no systemic or deliberate mishandling of classified information.\n\nThe inquiry, started more than three years ago, found that 38 current or former State Department officials were \u201cculpable\u201d of violating security procedures in a review of about 33,000 individual emails sent to or from the server that Ms. Clinton turned over to investigators.\n\nThe nine-page unclassified report, completed last month and shared with Congress this week, appears to bookend a controversy that dogged Ms. Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign against Donald J. Trump. Ms. Clinton blamed the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the inquiry for crippling her campaign after James B. Comey, then the bureau\u2019s director, reopened his investigation into the server days before the general election after initially declining to bring charges.\n\n\u201cWhile there were some instances of classified information being inappropriately introduced into an unclassified system in furtherance of expedience,\u201d the report said, \u201cby and large, the individuals interviewed were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them in their operations.\u201d", "description": "The report appears to bookend a controversy that dogged Ms. Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Catie Edmondson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/us/politics/18dc-clinton/18dc-clinton-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
