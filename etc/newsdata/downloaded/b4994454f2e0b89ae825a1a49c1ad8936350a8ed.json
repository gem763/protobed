Editors decided to send radio journalist Christine Kamikazi, political reporter Agn\u00e8s Ndirubusa, English-language journalist Egide Harerimana, photographer T\u00e9rence Mpozenzi and driver Adolphe Masabarakiza to check on the situation.\n\nThey were arrested while interviewing civilians, Iwacu said on its website.\n\nNow the group has been formally charged with \u201ccomplicity in undermining the internal security of state,\u201d tweeted Pierre Emmanuel, an editor at the website.\n\nHundreds of Burundians have been killed in clashes with security forces since 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza ran for a third, disputed term in office. The opposition said his candidacy violated the terms of the peace deal that ended the east African nation\u2019s civil war.\n\nIn the last few years, Nkurunziza has clamped down on civil rights by withdrawing from the International Criminal Court, expelling U.N. human rights investigators, shutting down rights groups and forcing journalists into exile. Schoolgirls who scribbled on his portrait were arrested.\n\nBurundi is due to hold elections next year after Nkurunziza won a referendum last year that could allow him to stay in office until 2034.\n\n\u201cCharging journalists doing their jobs with state security crimes is an assault on all journalists in Burundi trying to uncover the truth about what is going on in Burundi. This is an attempt to intimidate and silence the few remaining independent journalists left in the country,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa Director at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: in the run up to the electoral period, do your job and you will be punished.\u201d\n\nLast month the U.N. released a report saying police, security forces and the ruling party\u2019s youth league, the Imbonerakure, carried out killings, disappearances, torture and gang rape of people perceived to be opposed to the president.", "description": "Four Burundian journalists arrested this week were charged on Saturday with undermining state security, an editor at their newspaper tweeted, as Burundi's government clamps down on journalists and human rights groups ahead of elections in 2020.", "authors": ["Katharine Houreld", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
