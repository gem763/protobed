Isabel Infantes/PA Wire\n\nBenoliel, who goes by the stage name Marie S\u2019Infiltre, has gatecrashed several fashion shows in the past, having infiltrated the Etam runway just days earlier.\n\nThe 28-year-old YouTuber revealed she had borrowed a vintage Chanel suit from her mother for Monday\u2019s prank, which saw her talk her way into the French label\u2019s show before slowly approaching the catwalk, climbing onto it, and walking among the other models for the finale procession.\n\nBenoliel explained she had intended to smoke a cigarette on the catwalk, but model Gigi Hadid intervened before she could light up and escorted her off the runway.\n\n\u201cShe was rude,\u201d Benoliel said of Hadid. \u201cThen, after, there were three models that wanted to fight. I didn\u2019t understand why she was like this, so aggressive. Of course she doesn\u2019t know me. I can understand that she wanted to protect her friends.\u201d\n\nDespite her comments, Benoliel added that she is a fan of Gigi. \u201cI think now we can be close friends,\u201d the prankster said. \u201cShe thought I was a crazy girl. But she\u2019s right. She\u2019s right actually.\u201d\n\nIn response to the incident, Chanel provided the following statement confirming that Benoliel\u2019s appearance was unplanned.\n\n\u201cThis person is a comedian known for this type of prank,\u201d the label said. \u201cShe had crashed another runway recently. Her presence on the catwalk was not planned.\u201d", "description": "The prankster who clambered onto Chanel\u2019s runway at Paris Fashion Week has revealed her only intention behind the stunt was to \u201cmake people happy\u201d. \u00a0In an interview with The New York Times, Marie Benoliel argued that the fashion industry takes itself too seriously.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/12/gigi-hadid-chanel-crasher-main-0.jpg"}
