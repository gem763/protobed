Hot-stepping winger Cheslin Kolbe picked up an ankle injury against Japan and is not yet fit to play, so Sbu Nkosi takes his place.\n\n'It is a big blow,' said Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus.\n\n'Everybody knows the quality of player he is and the contributions he has made. Cheslin's top end speed and agility are his strengths and he is probably one of the best players in the world in those. He is up there with Shane Williams and Damian McKenzie.\n\n'So it is something we will miss. If you compare a 70 per cent Cheslin is not better than a 100 per cent Sbu.\n\n'It is a blow but we have full confidence in Sbu and the way he has been playing. He deserves his chance.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Wales have been dealt a crushing blow to their World Cup hopes with the news that star full-back Liam Williams is not only out of their semi-final against South Africa but of the final too if they make it.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/15/20136246-0-image-a-90_1571926851622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
