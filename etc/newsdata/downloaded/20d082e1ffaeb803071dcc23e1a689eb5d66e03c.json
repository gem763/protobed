PETERSBURG, Fla. (Reuters) - Ellen Kirschner is no cheerleader for Donald Trump, but the retired Florida letter carrier also feels unsure about voting for a Democrat in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nVolunteer Diana Fitser carries a clipboard with a list of some of the top election issues while canvassing voters for the Democratic Party of Pinellas County in St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S., August 24, 2019. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nHer independence makes her a rare breed in the American electorate - and a critical early target of both parties\u2019 campaigns in battleground states that are expected to decide the November 2020 contest.\n\nDemocrats are already out knocking on doors looking for voters like Kirschner. The leading Democratic super PAC is spending up to $450,000 per week to reach her with digital ads debunking the president\u2019s record. Republicans are ramping up a data-driven campaign to win her vote.\n\nVoters declaring themselves as independent of a major political party rose nationally by 6 percentage points to 28 percent of the U.S. electorate between 2000 and last year\u2019s congressional midterm contest in states with party registration, analyst Rhodes Cook wrote in Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball political newsletter at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.\n\nBut as few as 19 percent of Americans identifying as independent truly have no leaning to a party, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe Deciders Meet the voters defining American politics\n\n\u201cA lot of money is going to be spent on a relatively small number of persuadable voters,\u201d said Cook. Trump\u2019s polarizing leadership means there are fewer undecideds than usual, he said.\n\nKirschner lives at the epicenter of battleground state politics in Florida\u2019s sun-soaked Pinellas County, the largest swing county in the largest of the states that pivot between parties in presidential elections.\n\nIn 2016, she and her neighbors living in largely working- and middle-class ranch style homes in Pinellas\u2019 precinct No. 212 split their ballots evenly between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, with 335 votes each.\n\nShe said her views often transcend partisan divides.\n\nShe wants more gun control, but not an outright weapons ban. She agrees with Trump that illegal immigration is a problem, but disagrees with his administration on separating children and parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nKirschner voted for Trump and leans toward doing so again in 2020, but will not decide until she knows who the Democratic candidate will be.\n\n\u201cEnvironmentally, he is not good. Business-wise, he is not that bad,\u201d said Kirschner, 61, whose New York accent remains strong almost four decades after she moved to Florida.\n\nOnce a supporter of former Democratic President Barack Obama, Kirschner distrusts the party\u2019s present leftward lunge.\n\n\u201cGiving away this, and giving away that,\u201d she scoffs at promises to expand social entitlements and healthcare for illegal immigrants.\n\n\u2018A DIFFERENCE MAKER\u2019\n\nIndependents moved away from the major parties in the last presidential election while doubling support for third-party candidates, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.\n\nTrump secured the electoral votes of Florida and other close swing states with one percent of the vote or less. With the question of which of the many voter segments made the difference still up for debate, independents are seen as key.\n\nRepublicans won the independent vote by 7 percentage points in 2016. They say they can win them over again, citing internal Republican National Committee (RNC) data showing Trump\u2019s trade policies with Canada and Mexico, for example, popular among independents in Pinellas and across Florida.\n\nThe RNC figures also show independents are not impressed with Democratic proposals for government-run healthcare for all and are opposed to giving free care to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt always comes down to who can convince the independent voter,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesman Rick Gorka. \u201cThat is how you win the election.\u201d\n\nDemocratic groups are working to chip away at Trump\u2019s advantages. Priorities USA, a liberal super PAC, has launched an early digital ad campaign in battleground states including Florida to argue that economic growth under Trump is not benefiting all Americans.\n\nThe group\u2019s research shows Florida\u2019s independents favor Democrats over Republicans by 45 percent to 28 percent. One in four could be persuaded to vote for either party\u2019s candidate, according to its analysis.\n\nIn a state with tight elections, Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil told reporters last month that winning even half of these voters could be \u201ca difference maker.\u201d\n\nIndependents are most concentrated in the Tampa Bay media market, including Pinellas, and throughout the central state east to the Orlando area, according to an analysis by Susan MacManus, a political science professor emeritus at the University of South Florida. This is the state\u2019s so-called Interstate 4 corridor, an often decisive battleground.\n\nLocal Democrats in Pinellas are already canvassing for like-minded independents, as well as Democrats who do not vote regularly.\n\nOn a recent steamy Saturday, Anne Ferrante Ghosh and another volunteer hopped in and out of their cars for three hours along twisting residential roads to learn these voters\u2019 top concerns.\n\nReuters/Ipsos polling shows independent voters nationally rank healthcare and jobs as their top issues. Democrats are closest to sharing their priorities, although they consider climate most important. Republicans are most concerned about border security and government-funded services for illegal immigrants.\n\nFerrante Ghosh spoke to some half dozen voters - all Democrats, in the end, with none of the independents on her list answering their doors. She left handwritten notes with a party pamphlet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a box of chocolates,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you will get when you ring the doorbell.\u201d\n\nIn deadlocked precinct 212, located between St. Petersburg\u2019s Democratic city core and Pinellas\u2019 Republican suburbs and beach towns, Drew Pomeroy has not yet seen campaign activity.\n\nHe and his wife, Angie, live in a tucked-away neighborhood that calls itself Munchkinland for its low-slung homes. On their fence, a rainbow-colored sign welcomes visitors: \u201call cultures, all colors, all sizes, all beliefs, all people, all religions, all genders, all abilities, all ages, all sexualities.\u201d\n\nBoth consider themselves independent, despite registering as Democrats to participate in Florida\u2019s closed primary elections. In 2016, they voted for third-party candidates, unwilling to support either Trump or Clinton.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nDrew, 48, worries about the cost of healthcare. The small business owner is careful about how many pills he takes for his rheumatoid arthritis, given that they can cost as much as $2,500 per month.\n\nA vote for Trump is out of the question next year, the couple said. \u201cNot in a million years,\u201d Drew said.\n\nBut Angie, 38, said they would not blindly support the Democratic ticket. \u201cI vote with my heart,\u201d she said.", "description": "Ellen Kirschner is no cheerleader for Donald Trump, but the retired Florida letter carrier also feels unsure about voting for a Democrat in next year's presidential election.", "authors": ["Letitia Stein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424369663&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7T0SS"}
