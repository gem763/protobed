We can make cell phone IEDs in the style of the Afghans. I can teach you that.\"\n\nPHOTO: Craig Lane in an undated photo. (Department of Justice) More\n\nSmith was arrested on Sept. 21, and he allegedly admitted to the FBI that he provided people online with instructions for building bombs.\n\nAccording to charging documents, at least one of the instructions he allegedly provided in recent days would not have resulted in a viable explosive device.\n\nHe has been charged in Kansas with distributing information relating to weapons of mass destruction.\n\nLang, meanwhile, is currently facing federal charges in Florida, North Carolina and Arizona in separate cases with alleged ties to -- among other things -- a murdered couple in Florida, the terrorist group al-Shabab in East Africa and groups fighting against the Venezuelan government.\n\nAccording to court documents filed in those cases, in 2017 Lang met another Army veteran, Alex Jared Zwiefelhofer, in Ukraine, where they both fought with the Right Sector. And then in June 2017, Lang and Zwiefelhofer traveled to Kenya because they wanted to fight the al-Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab there, Zwiefelhofer allegedly told authorities. But when the pair then allegedly tried to enter South Sudan, they were stopped and sent back to the United States.", "description": "The FBI has arrested a U.S. soldier who allegedly discussed plans to bomb a major American news network, planned to travel to Ukraine to fight with violent far-right group Azov Battalion and allegedly distributed information online on how to build bombs.
