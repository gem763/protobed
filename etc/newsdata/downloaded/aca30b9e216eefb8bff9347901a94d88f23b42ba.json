It's definitely intentional,\" one netizen posted on Weibo.\n\nA number of companies and international airlines have edited their websites to refer to the democratic island of Taiwan as \"Taiwan, China\" or \"Chinese Taipei\".\n\nHotel chain Marriott's website in China was shut down by the authorities for a week in 2018 after a customer questionnaire listed Taiwan, Tibet and Hong Kong as separate countries, prompting the hotel chain to apologise and change the wording.\n\nBrands that appear to support the unrest in Hong Kong have also faced consumer ire, including the territory's flagship carrier Cathay.\n\nJewellery brand Tiffany removed an advert showing a woman covering one eye earlier this month, after Chinese consumers accused the company of supporting protesters by referencing a well known injury.", "description": "Luxury brand Dior has become the latest company to apologise to China over a perceived insult to national sovereignty, saying Thursday it", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/wire-19825464-1571298471-201_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
