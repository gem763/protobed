(He then waited for her at the train station and followed her home.) This got us wondering: how easy is it to get clues about somebody\u2019s location from their selfies?\n\nBefore we dive into eyeball reflections, it\u2019s important to note that phones and cameras save extra information in the photo file, including what kind of camera was used to take the photo, whether the flash fired, and (depending on your phone\u2019s settings) a GPS location for where the photo was taken. Some social media platforms may remove location data, but if you\u2019re concerned about privacy, you may want to check your settings to be sure you\u2019re not giving this information away too easily.\n\nTo test out the eyeball reflection strategy, fellow Lifehacker staffer Nick Douglas and I took a look at each other\u2019s selfies. We each chose a few that were taken outdoors or in a public place, and stared deeply into each other\u2019s eyes, digitally. It was kind of creepy.\n\nMy eyes.\n\nThe first thing we learned is that, depending on the lighting and the photo\u2019s resolution, this is not an easy task. Nick summed up the experience pretty well:\n\n1. Zooming into your eyes and staring for clues felt creepy, which will be good to remember next time I worry I\u2019m a psychopath. 2. I can\u2019t see a goddamn thing.\n\nBut there are a few clues. In one of Nick\u2019s photos, I thought I saw a reflection of a tree. However, there were also trees behind him in the photo, so \u201che\u2019s in a wooded area\u201d was not exactly a groundbreaking discovery.\n\nWith clearer photos, and a bit of luck, I could see how reflections might give the viewer a clue to where a person is, or in what context they were taking the photo. In one photo where Nick was wearing mirrored sunglasses (too easy, I know) I could tell that he was taking the photo himself, arm raised, and that he was standing on a not-too-busy footpath.\n\nNick\u2019s eyes in sunglasses.\n\nBesides context clues about a person\u2019s surroundings, it seems possible to pick up other information from eye reflections. If the photo was taken by another person, research on high-resolution photos shows that it is possible to identify people from eyeball reflections.\n\nYou can also sometimes pick out the shape of light sources \u2014 whether there\u2019s a window, or a single light on the ceiling, or a series of them like you\u2019d find in a store.\n\nSo, should you worry about how much information you\u2019re revealing in a selfie? Probably not too much... but maybe just a little.", "description": "Recently, a stalker found and attacked a Japanese pop star, in part by using an eye reflection to figure out what train station she uses.
