The hurricane season typically starts in June and lasts through November during a year, gathering strength in August and September. Colorado State University (CSU) estimates \u2018near average Atlantic hurricane season in 2019\u2019. There will be 14 named storms, including six hurricanes and two major hurricanes per CSU.\n\n\n\nThe third quarter of a year generally bears the brunt of unprecedented catastrophes, which cause mass devastation. The second half of last year was marred by the hurricane season that weighed on the profits of insurers. Hurricanes Lane, Florence and Michael, and other catastrophes like Typhoon Jebi and California wildfires took a toll on insurers\u2019 results last year. Per Munich RE, catastrophe losses in 2018 amounted to $160 billion, of which half was insured.\n\n\n\nNational Hurricane Center had categorized Hurricane Dorian as a category 5 storm. However, it has lost intensity and is a category 3 hurricane now. After battering the Bahamas, Dorian is expected to hit Florida's east coast and then coastlines of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\n\n\nPer media reports, analysts at UBS Group AG estimate Hurricane Dorian to cause about $25 billion in losses in Bahamas while the amount might touch $40 billion if it hits Florida. AccuWeather estimates the total damage and economic loss stemming from Hurricane Dorian to be in the range of $8-10 billion.\n\n\n\nFurther Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analysts stated \u201cthe storm could cause sizable losses for insurers if the current forecast remains. Given generally low Florida primary insurer retentions and increased YTD reinsurance purchases, a major Florida catastrophe event will significantly impact the reinsurers; domestic primary insurers remain exposed up to their reinsurance attachment points.\u201d The analysts also stated that \u201cYTD loss creep and potentially significant Dorian losses mean that catastrophe reinsurance rate increases and elevated reinsurance demand will persist into 2020\u201d per media reports.\n\n\n\nThough catastrophes are a concern for insurers, due to the high degree of losses incurred, they implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. After witnessing 19 back-to-back quarters of soft pricing market, insurers increased prices from the fourth quarter of 2018. Per Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: ) plc\u2019s Commercial Lines Insurance Pricing Survey in 2019, most of the commercial insurance lines should witness rate increase.\n\n\n\nProperty and casualty insurers are also taking reinsurance covers to safeguard their profits. As such shares of reinsurers like RenaissanceRe Holdings (NYSE: ) and Everest Re Group (NYSE: ) witnessed a decline in the last trading session.\n\n\n\nInsurers need to arrange sufficient funds to address huge claims arising due to calamities. The main challenge lies in settling claims smoothly without affecting their own financials. Due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment, insurers could build reserves over the last several quarters.\n\n\n\nNotably, share price of insurers having exposure to Florida like Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE: ) , United Insurance Holdings (NASDAQ: ) , HCI Group (NYSE: ) gained in the last trading session while shares of Heritage Insurance Holdings (NYSE: ) declined.\n\n\n\nLegalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than Marijuana\n\n\n\nAmericans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year\u2026 more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.\n\n\n\nNow that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as \u201cmind-blowing\u201d \u2013 and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.\n\nSee these 5 \u201csin stocks\u201d now >>", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Zacks Investment Research covering: Progressive Corp, HCI Group Inc, Renaissancere Holdings Ltd, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
