Later, three more deputies showed symptoms and were hospitalized as well.\n\nAt 5.33pm on Tuesday, a sheriff's deputy found an inmate at San Francisco County Jail No 4 (pictured) unresponsive\n\nThe inmates were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital while the deputies were taken to three different area hospitals.\n\nNancy Hayden Crowley, director of communications for the Sheriff's Department, told DailyMail.com that all the deputies have since been released as well as at least three of the inmates.\n\nThe status of the other two inmates was not immediately clear as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe inmates are all male and the deputy who first discovered the unresponsive innate is male as well.\n\nHowever, the sexes of the other deputies are currently unknown.\n\nHayden Crowley says an investigation has been opened and that a hazmat clean-up is needed.\n\n'The area where the [inmate] was discovered, people were moved out because that has to be cleared,' she said.\n\n'The Fire Department was in there and indicated that...the contamination didn't spread so that's good news.'\n\nHayden Crowley estimates clean-up will take about a day or two.\n\nFentanyl was originally developed, and approved, as cancer pain reliever and an anesthetic for surgery.\n\nIt often gets mixed into other drugs and is extremely potent. Just 0.25 milligrams can kill somebody.\n\nAccording to a report released last year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals, fentanyl accounted for a 45 percent increase in drug overdose deaths between 2016 and 2017.", "description": "At 5.33pm on Tuesday, a deputy found an inmate at San Francisco County Jail No 4 unresponsive.
