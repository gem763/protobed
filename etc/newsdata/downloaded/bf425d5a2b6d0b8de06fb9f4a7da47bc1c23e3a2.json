If only the same could be said for the viewing public\n\nSean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, shimmied his way on to Dancing with the Stars on Monday night in a shiny fluorescent green ruffled shirt and white trousers, brushing off criticism of his casting in the reality TV show by saying it was \u201cfinally time to enjoy myself\u201d.\n\nIn his attempt to dance the salsa to the Spice Girls hit Spice Up Your Life \u2013 highlights of which included some out-of-time clapping and a jubilant knee-slide finale \u2013 it was clear that the controversial former Trump aide was not holding back.\n\nSpicer\u2019s inclusion has prompted criticism, with the show\u2019s own host, Tom Bergeron, saying the competition is meant to offer \u201cjoyful respite from our exhausting political climate\u201d free from \u201cparty affiliations\u201d.\n\nDancing with the Stars (@DancingABC) Triple the spice in this Salsa! \ud83c\udf36 #DWTS @seanspicer pic.twitter.com/L85aPYVGt0\n\nBut when the judges\u2019 comments came, there were no bushes for Spicer, 47, to take cover in.\n\nBruno Tonioli said Spicer looked like he was being \u201cattacked by a swarm of wasps\u201d on the bongos and that his hips \u201clooked like they were set in cement\u201d. But, he conceded, \u201cI have to say it was strangely entertaining.\u201d\n\nCarrie Ann Inaba said: \u201cYou were off beat most of the dance, but you had fun.\u201d Len Goodman commended his \u201ccourage coming on this show\u201d.\n\nEach judge gave him four points, leaving him with an overall score of 12 out of 30.\n\nBut online, critics were not so kind:\n\nFull Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) We can\u2019t wait to see how flexible Sean Spicer is on Dancing with the Stars since he had his spine removed years ago. #DWTS\n\nAna Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas (@ananavarro) Happy Hispanic Heritage Month, peeps.\n\n\n\nThis fool failing at dancing Salsa while dressed like a neon parakeet with ruffles (obviously, the #DWTS wardrobe people are part of The Resistance), just made the argument of why this country needs Hispanics. https://t.co/AINUnSWvgQ\n\nJon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) Would I be a bad person if I secretly hoped that @seanspicer broke both of his legs competing on #DWTS? pic.twitter.com/GY6xTOIX5u\n\nMany mocked his costume, suggesting it was the work of a Democrat.\n\nNancy Lee Grahn (@NancyLeeGrahn) Clearly the Costume designer on #dwts is a Democrat. #nicelydone #SeanSpicer https://t.co/s2VVDoKzoa\n\nSome were already looking forward to the response of Melissa McCarthy, who has parodied Spicer on Saturday Night Live.\n\nBonnie Burton (@bonniegrrl) I can't wait until @MelissaMcCarthy wins an Emmy for her #SNL performance of @seanspicer on #DWTS! pic.twitter.com/AgIXNQrgwv\n\nAt least he could take comfort in the kindness of former colleagues. The former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus posted a photo and the comment: \u201cFantastic time cheering on Sean Spicer live from #DWTS!\u201d\n\nThe former Republican governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee also tweeted his support, encouraging viewers to vote for Spicer.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s tweet elicited a self-pitying response from Spicer, who appeared to take aim at the judges.\n\n\u201cClearly the judges aren\u2019t going to be with me. Let\u2019s send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won\u2019t be discounted. May God bless you,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nDuring Spicer\u2019s tenure in the White House, he was criticized over a number of misleading statements, including the size of Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd. He was also condemned for claiming that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against the German people.\n\nAfter he resigned in July 2017, he made a cameo at the Emmy awards and wrote a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President, in which he referred to Trump as \u201cunicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow\u201d.\n\nSpicer follows in the post-White House reality show footsteps of fellow Trump staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother after working for the president.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this report", "description": "The former White House press secretary said it was \u2018finally time to enjoy myself\u2019.
