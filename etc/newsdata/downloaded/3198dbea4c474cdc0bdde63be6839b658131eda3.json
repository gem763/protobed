I don't think there's a lot of things that would have happened if my last name wasn't Biden,\" he said.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has repeatedly denied speaking to his son about business dealings in foreign countries. Hunter Biden admitted during the same interview he had in fact talked to his father.\n\nSure sounds like trading money for political influence. Quite swampy.\n\nIn the meantime, Joe Biden isn't interested in answering any questions about his son's influence peddling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a conflict of interest. There\u2019s been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period. I'm not going to respond to that,\" Biden raged during a press event earlier this month when pressed by a reporter.\n\nWATCH: Joe Biden explodes when a reporter asks a very simple question:\n\n\n\n\"How was your role as Vice President in charge of policy in Ukraine and your son's job in Ukraine, how is that not a conflict of interest?\"\n\n\n\nBiden: \"I'm not going to respond to that!\"\n\n\n\nWhat is he hiding? pic.twitter.com/jbycKLARhE \u2014 Trump War Room (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@TrumpWarRoom) October 4, 2019\n\nThe Biden campaign has also publicly berated news outlets for reporting on Hunter Biden's questionable income.", "description": ".10/15/2019 12:20:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/277/dfaba410-115a-4b40-8fe0-1d50c845e967.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
