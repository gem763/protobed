He has tried to block administration officials from cooperating with the investigation and this week said he was the victim of a \"lynching,\" a racially charged description that was quickly condemned by many legislators.\n\nThe president also ordered US troops to withdraw from northern Syria two weeks ago before Turkey's cross-border offensive against the Kurds.\n\nThe Turkish offensive displaced hundreds of thousands of people and raised concerns that it would allow prisoners from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) group to escape.\n\nTrump's decision drew a sharp bipartisan rebuke in Congress and the poll shows it may have hurt his standing among rank-and-file Republicans.\n\nOverall, the poll found that Americans were more critical of Trump's handling of US foreign policy and ISIL than they were in a similar poll in April.\n\nAmong Republicans, 73 percent said they approved of the president's handling of US foreign policy and 75 percent said they approved of his handling of ISIL, down six points and eight points respectively from April.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States.\n\nIt gathered responses from 4,083 adults, including 1,773 Democrats, 1,542 Republicans and 447 independents. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of five percentage points.", "description": "Overall, 46 percent of Americans say they support impeachment and 40 percent say they oppose it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/b7fe6b833c194db2bfc6d153590351da_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
