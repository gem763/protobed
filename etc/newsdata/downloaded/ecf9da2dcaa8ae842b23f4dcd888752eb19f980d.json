They also will consider whether to signal a timeout on additional cuts in part because of the improvements they have seen so far.\n\nThe Fed's moves appear to be giving a lift to household spending in areas most responsive to interest rates, such as housing, autos and long-lasting big-ticket items such as appliances. This has helped offset a slump in manufacturing that is due to slowing global growth and business investment.\n\n\"Insurance cuts are working,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"When you dig into the details, the effect has been quite notable.\"\n\nAn analysis by Morgan Stanley found consumer spending on interest-sensitive durable goods such as cars and appliances rose at a 14.6% annualized pace over the six months through August. Contributions from durable-goods spending have accounted for 40% of the gains in consumer spending over those six months, up from 16% of the monthly increases last year.\n\nApplications for mortgages to purchase homes are up nearly 9% this month from a year earlier, after declining 2% last November from a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen this month to 4% from a recent high of 5.2% last November.\n\n\"I know there's a lot of questions about upcoming potential recession and things like that. Our customers don't seem to be viewing it that way, \" said Stuart Miller, executive chairman of home builder Lennar Corp., on a call with analysts earlier this month.\n\nSales of newly constructed homes are up more than 7% for the January-to-September period after rising less than 1% last year, according to the Commerce Department.\n\n\"It will come as no surprise...when I say that\" interest rates have been \"the catalyst for this most recent rise in housing demand,\" said Ryan Marshall, chief executive of PulteGroup Inc., on an earnings call last week. The Atlanta-based home builder reported its highest third-quarter order volumes since 2006.\n\nChanges in the Fed's benchmark rate, currently in a range of between 1.75% and 2%, influence a broad swath of financial conditions, including stocks, long-term interest rates and corporate bonds.\n\nAfter the central bank raised its benchmark rate four times last year, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in January shelved plans for further increases. By June, he began leading his colleagues toward cutting rates -- despite the economy's generally good health -- because of rising risks to growth.\n\nThe Fed's U-turn on rates this year has delivered \"the ultimate soft landing for the housing market,\" said Jim Klinge, a real-estate agent in Carlsbad, Calif. Housing markets in the second half of last year felt \"like a ghost town.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, heady home-price gains in recent years have dulled the potential boost from a decline in borrowing costs.\n\nFalling interest rates extend buyers' purchasing power. A general rule of thumb holds that a one-percentage-point drop in interest rates is equivalent to a 10% reduction in the costs of purchasing a home.\n\n\"If you are thinking about buying a home, that drop in rates is very important,\" said Brian Wickert, president of Accunet Mortgage in Waukesha, Wis. \"But the drop in rates has been gobbled up by the increases in price caused by higher demand and lower inventories.\"\n\nHeidi Matera made four offers since January before closing in June on a $170,000 two-bedroom home in Fox Point, Wis. Over that time, the rate for which she was preapproved fell to 4% from 4.75%, helping her to make a slightly more competitive offer.\n\n\"It was excellent in terms of the numbers,\" said Ms. Matera, 43 years old, who works in administration at a public university. She said her monthly mortgage payment is about one-third less than what she had been paying in rent for the prior three years.\n\nInterest-rate cuts have delivered less of a boost to companies. Business investment has been soft this year because of weak global growth and trade-related policy uncertainty.\n\n\"The current growth backdrop is more fragile because there's only so much lift easier monetary policy can give,\" said Ms. Zentner of Morgan Stanley. \"More certainty is the only thing that can provide a more lasting lift on the business-investment side.\"\n\nOther executives echoed her sentiments.\n\n\"I don't really feel like we've seen the cost of capital go down any,\" said Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oil-field services company Canary LLC, which relies heavily on imported products from China. \"A clear and resolute end to the trade war would make the clouds go away tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nCaterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, last week cut its profit forecast for the year, citing global economic uncertainty that had led customers to pull back on big purchases.\n\n\"Our sense is that customers are just far more cautious than they were certainly a year ago but even 90 days ago,\" said Rafael Lizardi, finance chief at chip maker Texas Instruments Inc., on an earnings call last week.\n\nIf the Fed does put further rate reductions on hold after this week, it would still have the option of resuming cuts down the road if the economy falters. Officials could act if recent economic gains are swamped by a sharp downswing in growth, such as an extended chill in business investment that leads to hiring cutbacks.\n\n\"When there's tension in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious and they pull back,\" said Mr. Lizardi. \"We are at the very end of a long supply chain, and when the ones at the very front pull back, it becomes a traffic jam.\"\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 05:44 ET (09:44 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
