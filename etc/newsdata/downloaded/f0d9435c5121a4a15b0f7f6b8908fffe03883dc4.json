And, just yesterday, more evidence of this booming economy with 3.5 percent unemployment rate,\" he touted. \"The economy is booming. Democrats don't want to talk about that, and so they've been focused on impeachment.\"\n\nThe president has resisted Democratic attempts to produce documents and administration witnesses for the inquiry, although acknowledging that Democrats \"have the votes\" to proceed.\n\nThe White House was expected to send a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as early as Monday arguing that Congress could not mount its impeachment inquiry without having a vote to authorize it. The speaker has said such a vote is unnecessary.\n\nIn the chairmen's Friday letter, they warned the White House that \"Speaker Pelosi has confirmed that an impeachment inquiry is underway, and it is not for the White House to say otherwise.\"\n\nTurning to the letter, Short told Hegseth that the chairmen's source in the letter -- a report in \"The Washington Post\" - was distorted.\n\n\"I don't know about Volker's exchanges. I saw those same news reports. But you know what, President Zelenskiy himself said he felt no pressure. From the President or the Vice President. That should have ended a lot of these inquiries at that point,\" said Short.\n\n\"The reality is that we're going to continue to focus on what we think is most important to the American people,\" he concluded.\n\n\"There [are] 21 Democrats who are residing in districts where Donald Trump won in 2016. And those members have to be put on notice and say, 'are you actually going to help your constituents to do things that are beneficial for the American people or are you siding with Nancy Pelosi and these endless investigations?\" he asked.", "description": "A letter sent from\u00a0House Democrats\u00a0to\u00a0Vice President\u00a0Mike Pence requesting documents as part of the impeachment inquiry was based on \"fake news,\" Chief of Staff Marc Short said Saturday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/cummings-short-schiff-AP-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
