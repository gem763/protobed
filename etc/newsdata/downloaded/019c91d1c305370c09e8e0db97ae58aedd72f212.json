He is owner of the unlicensed Nessma TV channel, which he has used to promote his political ambitions. He was detained in August on suspicion of tax evasion and money laundering, charges that his supporters say are politically motivated.\n\nHis detention is a wild card in the long-running struggle for political supremacy in the young democracy, which has pitted the moderate Islamist Ennahda party against the increasingly splintered anti-Islamist opposition.\n\nKaroui\u2019s appeal has been pitched against a sense of growing disillusionment with the country\u2019s main political leaders, who have failed to improve the lives of ordinary citizens since the country launched the Arab spring in 2011 by toppling of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nabil Karoui on trial in 2012 for screening the Franco-Iranian film Persepolis on his TV channel. Photograph: Hassene Dridi/AP\n\nKaroui is sometimes depicted as Tunisia\u2019s equivalent of Silvio Berlusconi. In reality, however, he is more like the wealthy paterfamilias in a Middle Eastern soap opera, a man touched by both tragedy and success \u2013 an image he has skilfully communicated to a key impoverished section of Tunisian society that has until now been detached from the main political trends.\n\nHe has used his TV channel to air images of himself delivering aid from a family charity to the poor, a slick and sometimes populist figure in comparison with his rivals.\n\nThe wealthy secular political elite, which he once backed, now see him as a threat, while some on the Islamist side have still not forgiven him for screening Marjane Satrapi\u2019s Franco-Iranian film Persepolis in 2011.\n\nChief among Karoui\u2019s rivals is Youssef Chahed, the current prime minister. Karoui\u2019s supporters blame him for putting their man behind bars in an effort to hobble his campaign.\n\nIn his campaign offices in Tunis, Karoui\u2019s team believe the moves against him may have benefited their candidate, not least the constant attacks on him on social media which have kept his name in the public eye.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Youssef Chahed arrives to file his candidacy for the presidential election.

In some cities it is more than 30%, leading some voters to express nostalgia for the pre-revolution regime.\n\nTunisia\u2019s electoral body has declared that Karoui is entitled to run, but it is unclear is what would happen if he won the runoff for president, which would pose constitutional questions if he was still in jail.\n\nCommenting on the importance of the current round of elections, Djordje Todorovic, a spokesperson for a joint election observation mission by the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, said that this time round Tunisians were more focused on day-to-day issues.\n\n\u201cThe elections in 2011 were to punish the old regime and celebrate freedom. In 2015 it was an issue of identity \u2013 who was Islamist and who was not. Now the question voters are asking of politicians is: \u2018What are you going to do for me?\u2019 with the economy a priority.\u201d", "description": "Jailed Nabil Karoui hopes to appeal to voters disillusioned by lack of progress since Arab spring", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88af6382fecd2c62dc17c54d37c5a42f185ca207/0_184_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b709d62ae8aba3e618e6370b9090ea2", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
