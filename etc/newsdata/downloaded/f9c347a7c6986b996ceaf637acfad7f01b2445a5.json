Can he coach? Can he manage people? Has he won anything?\u2019\n\n\u201cI got my pro license in England, I have proved I can manage people, I\u2019ve won small tournaments at international level and I qualified for the Asian Cup with India, the equivalent of Iceland getting to the World Cup.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cWe won our first game 4-1, the first time they\u2019d ever won a match in the Asian Cup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for chairmen because I understand it can be better the devil you know.\n\n\u201cWould a chairman sit down and consider all that when someone else has been at Portsmouth, Liverpool , here or there?\n\n\u201cBut I hope one of them will take a chance. I am less of a risk than anyone else because I haven\u2019t failed here yet and I will only get one shot.\n\n\u201cIf I fail in my first job here then I won\u2019t get another chance.\u201d", "description": "Stephen Constantine fired India up the FIFA rankings and has also managed Sudan and Rwanda in tough situations", "authors": ["Tom Hopkinson", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13860085.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AFC-Asian-Cup-India-v-United-Arab-Emirates-Group-A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
