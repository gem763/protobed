Both were released on bail.\n\nOutside the court, demonstrators queued to get in, some chanting slogans such as \"wearing a face mask isn't a crime\" and \"the law is unjust\".\n\nMany said they feared the mask ban was just the first of more emergency orders to come.\n\n\"It's an excuse to just introduce other totalitarian laws, next is martial law,\" one protester outside the court, who gave his surname Lo.\n\nInternet next?\n\nIn a radio interview, a government cabinet member suggested internet curbs could be introduced, a move that would have profound repercussions for the city.\n\nA man wearing a face mask arrives in a police vehicle to the Eastern District Courts on Monday [Mohd Rasfan/AFP]\n\n\"At this stage, the government will consider all legal means to stop the riots,\" Executive Council member Ip Kwok-him told Commercial Radio. \"We would not rule out a ban on the internet.\"\n\nProtesters use online forums and encrypted messaging apps to mobilise and organise.\n\nHong Kong has been battered by 18 consecutive weekends of unrest, fanned by widespread public anger over Chinese rule and the police response to protests.\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland, which fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under the 50-year \"one country, two systems\" model China agreed to ahead of the 1997 handover by Britain.\n\nAfter Beijing and local leaders took a hard stance, the demonstrations snowballed into a wider movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\nLam has refused major concessions, but struggled to come up with any political solution.\n\nOn Friday, Lam announced the face mask ban, sparking renewed protests.\n\nThroughout the weekend largely peaceful flash mob rallies and marches featuring people wearing masks broke out across the city.\n\nBut more hardcore protesters went on the rampage, trashing multiple subway stations, ransacking government offices, and vandalising businesses with mainland ties.\n\nPLA warning\n\nSunday witnessed the largest protests, with police firing tear gas to disperse tens of thousands of people marching on the main island. Clashes broke out at multiple other locations throughout the day, with dozens injured.\n\nA warning flag was raised on the roof of a People's Liberation Army barracks after protesters shone laser pens at the building, the first time Chinese troops in the city have made such a move.\n\nThe city's subway system - which carries up to four million people a day - has been largely out of action since Friday night.\n\nMany major supermarket and convenience store chains closed down or operated limited hours, sparking panic buying and long lines.", "description": "A university student and a 38-year-old woman face years in jail for 'unlawful assembly' and wearing masks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/7/98e2920f1913403b8263125fd6da3550_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
