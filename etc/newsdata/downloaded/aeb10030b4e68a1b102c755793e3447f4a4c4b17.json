Jackie Walorski (R-IN), who represents South Bend, has called for an investigation into the events. She's also looking into federal legislation to address the issue:\n\n\u201cReports that more than 2,000 fetal remains were found on the property of longtime South Bend abortion doctor Ulrich Klopfer are sickening beyond words. He was responsible for thousands of abortions in Indiana, and his careless treatment of human remains is an outrage. \u201cEvery human life is precious, and every woman and baby deserves care and respect. This tragic case shows why abortion providers must be held to strict guidelines and face rigorous oversight. I will be looking into federal legislation to ensure the remains of aborted babies are always treated with dignity, including in the case of chemical abortions. \u201cState and federal authorities should conduct a full investigation into this case and take any steps necessary to protect Hoosiers, including the unborn, from unsafe practitioners.\u201d\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nThe remains of 2,246 unborn children were discovered on Thursday at the home of the late Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, a former abortionist, who died earlier this month. Family members were going through belongings on his property when they made the discovery.\n\nThe family's attorney called Will County, Illinois Sheriff's Office to report the findings, at which point sheriff's detectives, crime scene investigators and representatives from the coroner\u2019s office were dispatched to the rural home. The Coroner's Office took possession of the fetal remains and removed them from the property.\n\nAccording to the Coroner's Offie, there was no evidence to suggest that any abortions had taken place in home. The family is fully cooperating as officials continue to investigate.\n\nKlopfer was an abortion provider in South Bend, Indiana at the Women\u2019s Pavilion until his medical license was suspended in 2015, WNDU-TV reported. He had 1,833 abortion-related complaints filed against him by Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller, primarily relating to record keeping and informed consent violations.\n\nFrom National Right to Life News:", "description": "Disgusting..09/14/2019 19:59:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/257/69d2a9fc-86a6-4396-bcbb-67d630cb84bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
