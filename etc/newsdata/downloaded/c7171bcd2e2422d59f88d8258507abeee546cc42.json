USA TODAY\n\nSYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Australia\u2019s Qantas on Sunday completed the first non-stop commercial flight from New York to Sydney, which was used to run a series of tests to assess the effects of ultra long-haul flights on crew fatigue and passenger jetlag.\n\nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner touched down in Sydney early Sunday morning after a flight of 19 hours and 16 minutes \u2014 the world\u2019s longest.\n\nQantas said tests ranged from monitoring pilot brain waves, melatonin levels and alertness to exercise classes for passengers. A total of 49 people were on board, in order to minimize weight and give the necessary fuel range.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re really happy with how the flight went and it\u2019s great to have some of the data we need to help assess turning this into a regular service,\u201d said Capt. Sean Golding, who led the four pilots.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Qantas on Sunday completed the first non-stop commercial flight from New York to Sydney.

Two more research flights are planned as part of the project evaluations - London to Sydney in November and another New York to Sydney in December.\n\n\u201cWe know ultra long-haul flights pose some extra challenges but that\u2019s been true every time technology has allowed us to fly farther. The research we\u2019re doing should give us better strategies for improving comfort and wellbeing along the way,\u201d said Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce.\n\nNight flights usually start with dinner and then lights off, but he said that for this flight, \u201cwe started with lunch and kept the lights on for the first six hours, to match the time of day at our destination. It means you start reducing the jetlag straight away.\u201d\n\nProfessor Marie Carroll from the University of Sydney said she and fellow passengers did a lot of stretching and group exercises at prescribed intervals.\n\n\u201cWe did the Macarena in the economy cabin,\u201d she said.\n\nMore: Qantas' nearly 20-hour flight from New York to Sydney to hit the skies.
