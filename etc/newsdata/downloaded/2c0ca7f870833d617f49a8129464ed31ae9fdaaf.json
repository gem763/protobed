There the family erects their quintessentially British-style house and we follow whatever funny situations that may arise.\n\nStraightaway we are on shaky ground.\n\nWhile the show offers viewers an opportunity to look outside their own living room and national borders, it is wasting any potential it (arguably) might have to enlighten us or prompt reflection. It simplifies the Himba culture as an \u2018exotic other\u2019 next to the \u2018normal\u2019 British family \u2013 and as such reinforces dangerous, racist stereotypes.\n\nFor several years, SAIH, an organisation of students and academics in Norway the I work for, has run the Radi-Aid project, urging media and NGOs to avoid stereotypical portrayals of the global south.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur project also promotes a more nuanced approach as an antidote to an \u2013 already simplified \u2013 image of Africa and \u2018poor countries\u2019 in Western media.\n\nSometimes we come across creative and informative presentations of African contexts and feel that the world is moving in the right direction. Then, suddenly, a show like The British Tribe Next Door pops up and we are reminded that we all still have a long way to go.\n\nThe star of the show is TV-celebrity Scarlett Moffatt. The show puts her and the Moffatt family at the centre, while the Himba tribe serves as the show\u2019s \u2018entertainment\u2019 factor.\n\nAn emotional moment is presented when Scarlett Moffatt starts to cry because of a Himba woman\u2019s first encounter with a mirror. To the woman, it looks like \u2018water on the wall\u2019 and she is fascinated by her own reflection. The British TV star finds this thought-provoking, but mainly because it reminds her of her own insecurities connected to body image.\n\nThe Himba tribe is there only so the Moffatts can tell their story, not the other way around.\n\nA replica of Scarlett\u2019s family home was rebuilt in Namibia (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nOne might argue that it\u2019s good to give the British audience a peek into the world of a secluded people in Namibia. If only the show had used this opportunity to expand our world view.\n\nBut the information provided about the tribe is basic and generic. As the first segment outlines: \u2018The Himba are semi-nomadic\u2026 some have moved to towns and cities, but in this village they seldom see the outside world.\u2019 That\u2019s about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it is not the entertainment industry\u2019s responsibility to educate the public on international relations, do we really need another stereotypical and clich\u00e9d portrayal of an African tribe?\n\nOne of the wonders of the modern world is that we have so much access to information and that people all around the globe can communicate their own reality.\n\nThis is also about combating our Western legacy of being exposed to images of Africa as a continent of primitive people with a lack of agency \u2013 the capacity of someone to act of their own free will. Even in aid commercials from Africa, it is rare to see doctors and nurses from the actual countries.\n\nWe still maintain the divide between the modern white man and the savage black African, even though we know that the image is more complex.\n\nIn this sense, The British Tribe Next Door nurtures an old-fashioned view of the global south, and, quite frankly, we should be further down the road by now.\n\nMORE: The British Tribe Next Door review: Scarlett Moffatt\u2019s documentary is every bit as painful as it is problematic\n\nMORE: Black women are too often overlooked by white privileged men.
