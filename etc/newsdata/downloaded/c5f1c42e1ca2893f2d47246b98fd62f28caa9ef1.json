The decision will be taken later,\u201d she told reporters at her residence in New Delhi on Sunday, adding that there was no plan to cut spending currently.\n\nSitharaman also said the government would decide on additional market borrowings for the second half of 2019/20 later.\n\nRatings firm S&P Global said on Friday India\u2019s move to cut corporate tax rates was a \u201ccredit negative development\u201d despite potentially boosting the economy as it will widen its fiscal deficit.\n\nGovernment sources told Reuters this month that India is likely to miss its fiscal deficit target for the current financial year and, toward the end of 2019, be forced to raise it to 3.5% of GDP from 3.3% after economic growth fell to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter.", "description": "India will not revise its fiscal deficit target immediately and is not planning any spending cuts at this stage, the finance minister said on Sunday, after slashing corporate tax rates to boost a flagging economy.", "authors": ["Manoj Kumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432616870&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0CV", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
