When I was young, Bonfire Night was the big occasion to look forward to at this time of year, while Hallowe\u2019en went almost unnoticed. Every high street would have at least one gaggle of children demanding a \u201cpenny for the guy\u201d, and we all learnt the rhyme encouraging us to \u201cremember, remember the fifth of November; gunpowder, treason and plot\u201d.\n\nI was surprised, then, to discover how prominent an event Hallowe\u2019en was at the time of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605. All Hallow\u2019s Eve had been well celebrated back in the Middle Ages, as can be seen in the stained-glass windows of the \u201cdanse macabre\u201d still visible in churches today. These skeletons \u201cdancing\u201d in the graveyard were the souls in purgatory awaiting their chance to ascend to heaven \u2013 a very Catholic concept that didn\u2019t sit well after the Reformation in a country worried about attack from the powerful nations of Catholic Europe.\n\nThe Gunpowder Plot had only just been uncovered when a law was passed in Parliament which demanded that the people of England celebrate its failure. This was a great way to flush out more Catholics, since suspicions would be raised if you didn\u2019t celebrate with everyone else. The law remained until it was repealed in 1859, and as a result the worryingly \u201cCatholic\u201d Hallowe\u2019en was usurped as a seasonal celebration by the more suitably \u201cProtestant\u201d Bonfire Night.\n\nIn modern times both festivals can be considered part of a winter season of feasting \u2013 a concept which I really like, and first came across in Gizzi Erskine\u2019s cookbook Season\u2019s Eatings. Rather like the summer season of Wimbledon, Henley, Ascot and so on, this book offered recipe ideas for Hallowe\u2019en, Bonfire Night, the build-up to Christmas, New Year celebrations and finally Twelfth Night.", "description": "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in feeling that Hallowe\u2019en is now more celebrated than Bonfire Night and that this is due to the growing American influence on our culture.", "authors": ["Stephen Harris", "Chef", "Owner Of The Sportsman"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2016/11/03/bonfire-night-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqeo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2016-11-03"}
