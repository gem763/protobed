One man appeared to get in a way of the filming during one video, forcing the couple to film the shot again\n\nThis behind-the-scenes footage was shocking to some fans, who had know idea just how produced the reality show was before seeing the video.\n\n'Ugh just shows how produced this is,' one commenter wrote.\n\nAnother person wanted to understand how someone could genuinely find love in the overly produced environment of the reality show.\n\n'Do they actually get to enjoy each other's company, or is it all \"getting the right shot\"? How can you even form a connection with someone with you can't even get to know them because you're always making the shots \"correct\",' the person questioned.\n\nAnother person wrote: 'That\u2019s pathetic that they even need to stage ppl walking out naturally. Someone needs to write a book about everything else going on behind the scenes.'\n\nLooking for love: Peter was on the date with Kelsey (right). He started filming his season last month, which will air in January\n\nThe release of this footage comes as it was revealed last week that Peter was taken to the hospital in Costa Rica after suffering an injury that resulted in 22 stitches on the man's head.\n\nHe was reportedly carrying two cocktail glasses when he had a 'freak accident' and fell, Radar Online first reported.\n\n'Peter suffered a freak accident. He got a cut on his head, he did get stitches but he\u2019s 100 per cent OK and production is already back underway,' franchise host Chris Harrison said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n'He\u2019s still the dashing, handsome pilot we\u2019ve all dreamed of.'\n\nPeter continued filming with stitches in his head for the last week, all of which viewers will probably get to see once the season airs in January.", "description": "The Bachelor started filming its upcoming season last month with Peter Weber.
