Regional parties will need 4,000 signatures, up from 750.\n\nThe opposition was also unhappy at another change requiring civil servants running for office to take leave without pay.\n\n\u201cThe law was approved in a rush without addressing our demands,\u201d said Girma Bekele, vice chairman of the Joint Council of Political Parties representing 107 opposition groups.\n\n\u201cIf (the law) is going to be applied without addressing our concerns, it will be repeating what has happened in the previous elections where the ruling party won by 100 percent. We don\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Girma said.\n\nThe vote is also under threat from ethnic rivalries.\n\nThe election board in June said that violence, which has driven 2.4 million people out of their homes according to the United Nations, could delay the vote.\n\nA national census has already been postponed twice.\n\n\u201cHaving all our reservations (about the law) puts the upcoming election in question,\u201d Mulatu Gemech, deputy chairman of the opposition Oromo Federalist Congress which is a member of the coalition, told Reuters.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the election board or EPRDF.\n\nDespite the opposition\u2019s disquiet over the electoral law, Ethiopia\u2019s 100 million citizens are seeing unprecedented political change. Abiy has freed journalists and activists, lifted bans on political parties, and prosecuted officials accused of gross human rights abuses.", "description": "A coalition of Ethiopian opposition parties on Tuesday threatened to boycott a national vote next year without changes to an electoral law they view as biased towards the ruling party.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
