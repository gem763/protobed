Her nominees from Romania and Hungary have already been shot down by lawmakers.\n\nWhile Wojciechowski's hopes are still alive, he has a grueling climb ahead after a hearing in which he struggled to give answers on topics such as big land investments, glyphosate and his own financial affairs, which have been the subject of an investigation by the EU's anti-fraud unit.\n\nParliamentarians across the political spectrum lined up to slate the nominee for his vagueness, with European People's Party coordinator Herbert Dorfmann telling POLITICO that the \u201chearing was too weak. He needs to come back. This is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAsked if that was the collective view of group coordinators, Dorfmann replied: \u201cSeems so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can say that they would have confidence in him as a commissioner based on today\u2019s hearing\" \u2014 Seb Dance, S&D vice chair of the environment committee\n\nPeople close to the proceedings said that the first step would be for the main parties to put more written questions to Wojciechowski, who at times strained to find the right words in English. If his next batch of written responses are unsatisfactory, the parliamentarians will demand a second hearing.\n\nSome from the Socialists and Democrats echoed Dorfmann's complaints, saying that the group was \u201cnot satisfied at all\u201d with the Polish candidate.\n\nSeb Dance, the S&D vice chair of Parliament\u2019s environment committee, told POLITICO: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can say that they would have confidence in him as a commissioner based on today\u2019s hearing. The goal should be to impress sufficiently on the first go and I don\u2019t think that has happened.\u201d\n\nAccepting that Wojciechowski could be \u201cin trouble,\u201d Dance added that a second hearing \u201cis not an unusual request.\u201d\n\nA call for applause by agriculture committee chair Norbert Lins at the end of the session was greeted with silence.\n\nThe nominee\u2019s two-and-a-half hour appearance was peppered with bland comments, emphasis on dialogue and a weak response to the sole question about his financial tangles with OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office.\n\nA call for applause by Agriculture Committee Chair Norbert Lins at the end of the session was greeted with silence.\n\nLins later tweeted that \u201cWojciechowski\u2019s answers unfortunately lacked clarity in my opinion. I do not just want to discuss. I want to see action for our farmers.\u201d\n\nKnives may now be out for the Pole from the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists grouping, in part because of his views on the European Green Deal and animal welfare \u2014 positions singled out in a critical statement by Dorfmann after the hearing.\n\nFor Renew Europe, coordinator Ulrike M\u00fcller said: \u201cWe think we need a second hearing! This presentation was not satisfactory!\u201d She qualified that by saying that first he should answer written questions and then the coordinators should decide during a second hearing.\n\nFinnish MEP Petri Sarvamaa summed up the mood of many when he tweeted: \u201cHearing over for #Wojciechowski and I hear grumbling around the room. Too many ambiguities heard, too little specifics and not enough decisiveness in his answers. I still want to believe in him but my prediction is that he has to come back for another appearance.\u201d", "description": "Parliamentarians were disappointed with Janusz Wojciechowski\u2019s replies on topics from trade to his own finances.", "authors": ["Arthur Neslen", "Eddy Wax", "Zosia Wanat", "Lili Bayer", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172719582-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
