Further tests suggested people specifically disliked the bearers of bad tidings, not others who happened to be around at the time.\n\nThe findings were especially unnerving for doctors, who must regularly deliver awful news. When participants had to imagine being told the results of a skin biopsy, those who were told they had cancer liked the doctor a lot less than people given the all-clear. Worse, they were more likely to say they thought the doctor was actively hoping they had cancer.\n\nThe impulse to blame the hapless messenger is so ingrained that the study\u2019s authors had just two ideas for dealing with it: try to preface bad news by suggesting you have the recipient\u2019s best interests at heart, or get someone else to do it.\n\nI doubt either strategy would have helped people I have known over the years who delivered bad news to a manager in their firm only to get their heads bitten off. Yet you do not need to be a management guru to understand it is far better for bosses to know about trouble afoot.\n\nAndy Grove, the late former head of Intel, the computer chipmaker, used to advise chief executives to cultivate company \u2018\u2018Cassandras\u2019\u2019 who could deliver early warnings about important industry changes, even if they were relatively junior.\n\nStephen Schwarzman, co-founder of the Blackstone private equity giant, tells another revealing story about the importance of hearing bad news in his new memoir, What it Takes. In 1989, a young partner at his firm championed the purchase of a Philadelphia steel company that an older partner said would be disastrous. The deal went ahead, the company imploded and Mr Schwarzman was duly summoned to the New York office of an investor, where he received a terrific bollocking.\n\n\u2018\u2018He asked me to sit down and started screaming at me,\u2019\u2019 he writes. \u2018\u2018Was I a complete incompetent or just stupid?\u2019\u2019 As the tirade went on, \u2018\u2018I had to force myself not to cry.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe experience led him to rethink the way the firm made decisions. Never again would one person be allowed to approve a deal single-handedly. New proposals would be thrashed out in a big meeting at which everyone had to focus on potential pitfalls and ask questions that the proponent then had to answer.\n\nFinally, having later learnt that at least one analyst had also quietly opposed the steel deal, Mr Schwarzman resolved to talk to junior people working on a potential investment, not just their bosses.\n\nThat is a lesson that applies far beyond big Wall Street financial firms.\n\nIf you are lucky, you work for a boss who has learnt it.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Delivering unwelcome truths to power often backfires for the messenger \u2014 that has to change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4599%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_363/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/96483ffabe47d6622141451947f576cd53855428", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
