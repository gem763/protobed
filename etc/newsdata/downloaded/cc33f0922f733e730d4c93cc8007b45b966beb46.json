The news was first reported by Nick Ismail of Information Age.\n\nMarie Myers, the company's chief financial officer, who joined in January, is also leaving at the end of the year, UiPath Chief Marketing Officer Bobby Patrick told Business Insider.\n\nToni Iafrate, UiPath's vice president of global communications, said Myers was leaving \"to pursue other opportunities.\"\n\nPatrick said the changes were part of the company's \"desire to move more investment from back-office to customer-facing operations.\"\n\n\"We need to be more customer-focused,\" he said. \"We're too slow to respond on tactical customer needs.\"\n\nUiPath provides software that helps businesses automate repetitive tasks across a patchwork of applications, a field also known as robotic process automation.

Toni Iafrate, UiPath's vice president of global communications, said that even with the job cuts, the company's workforce was still about 50% bigger than at the beginning of the year.\n\nUiPath was founded in Bucharest, Romania, in 2005 and created automation scripts for the IT industry.
