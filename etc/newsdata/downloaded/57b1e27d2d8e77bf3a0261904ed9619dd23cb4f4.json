I expect him to cause some issues for the Australian batters.\u201d\n\nThe only other change to the England side that chased down their record fourth-innings target of 359 by one wicket in Leeds is one of position rather than personnel.\n\nJason Roy will move down to four after an unsuccessful trial at the top of the order, swapping places with Joe Denly followed the latter\u2019s gritty half-century last time out. Root had previously backed Roy as an opener but admitted the returns were simply not enough to justify a continuation of the experiment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not gone exactly how we\u2019d have liked and he hasn\u2019t scored the runs he would have liked,\u201d said the skipper. \u201cAs before we\u2019re trying to find a formula at the top of the order that works for us. Jason is a high quality player and could be better suited to four. We all know what he can do when he gets himself in and hopefully batting a little lower down helps him to do that.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s played some good cricket throughout the summer, he\u2019s got himself in, so it\u2019s a great opportunity for him to go and get us off to a good start.\u201d\n\nRoot knows better than most how close England came to surrendering the urn on home soil for the first time since 2001 and appreciates the stage his side have been given by Stokes\u2019 brilliance. Vast swathes of the country have become gripped by the series and the team are hoping to ride that feelgood factor through the next two games.\n\n\u201cIt makes this a very special week and a great opportunity for us to build on what was a fantastic win and carry that forward,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come off a back win like that and it\u2019s a big lift for the whole squad, for that game to unravel how it did and for us to turn up here full of confidence and very much alive in this series. I feel that everyone has really got behind both teams, especially off the back of last week in Test cricket. It\u2019s great to see Test cricket seen in that light in this country, and globally as well.\n\n\u201cEvery ground we\u2019ve been to we\u2019ve been blessed with brilliant support. To see a full house at Headingley and on day four was probably the first time I\u2019ve seen that for a long time, and to hear more than 15,000 tickets here have already been sold for day five...it\u2019s a great place to be.
