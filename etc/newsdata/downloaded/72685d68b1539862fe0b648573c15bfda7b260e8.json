USA TODAY\n\nOklahoma is down four spots to No. 9 while the top four teams held serve in the latest USA TODAY Sports Re-Rank 1-130.\n\nReplacing the Sooners at No. 5 is Penn State, which moved to 8-0 with a 28-7 win in the rain against Michigan State. While No. 4 LSU put together another impressive win, this time against No. 13 Auburn, Clemson remained at No. 3 after trouncing Boston College.\n\nThe Sooners were leapfrogged by No. 6 Oregon, No. 7 Florida and No. 8 Baylor.\n\nWhile the Re-Rank is not necessarily a primer for how the College Football Playoff selection committee will approach seeding the top teams in the country come November and December, that Oklahoma is only down to No. 9 speaks to the lack of diversity in the championship race.\n\nOklahoma receiver CeeDee Lamb is pushed out of bounds by Kansas State defenders Wesley Burris (49) and linebacker Nick Allen during the first quarter at Bill Snyder Family Stadium.

But the teams just behind Oklahoma aren't worthy of the bump: No. 10 Georgia has scuffled, No. 11 Utah similarly has just one win against a team with a winning record and No. 12 SMU doesn't have the strength of schedule to move ahead of the Sooners even as one of the Bowl Subdivision's few undefeated teams.\n\nTIGERS MOVE UP: LSU now No. 2 behind Alabama in Amway Coaches poll\n\nFOOTBALL FOUR: Alabama, LSU ready for showdown as Oklahoma falls\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 9 in college football\n\nThis week's Re-Rank is noteworthy for the heavy presence of teams from the American in the Top 25. In addition to SMU, the league has No. 20 Cincinnati, No. 23 Memphis, No. 24 Central Florida and No. 25 Navy. The conference is better than the ACC and in terms of its top third can easily rival the Pac-12.\n\nNew to the Top 25: No. 24 UCF, No. 25 Navy.\n\nOut of the Top 25: No. 30 Iowa State, No. 31 Texas.", "description": "There's another change at the top of  NCAA Re-Rank with Oklahoma falling to No. 9 after a loss.
