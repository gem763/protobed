Legal processes are long in their nature, and that is why I am steadfast in taking the matter to its logical conclusion to avoid any mistakes and to respect the views of members,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an letter responding to Ngcobo\u2019s demands, Luyanda Gidini, Abasa\u2019s secretary and one of those being threatened with the lawsuit, said the R500 000 would not be paid because they regarded the claim to be frivolous.\n\n\u201cGiven the scourge of gender-based violence in the country, calling out a man in a position of authority for being implicated in such is a public interest matter on its own,\u201d Gidini said.\n\n\u201cWe would also like to categorically state that the R500 000 will not be paid as it is a frivolous claim with no legal or factual merit,\u201d read part of the letter that Gidini wrote on behalf of the entire group.\n\nThe other members of the group are Jeridah Makgae, Robyn Vilakazi, Zokhanyo Pikashe, Moagi Mpshe, Sibusiso Nduna and Ashley Dicken, who has since taken over as acting president.\n\nGidini said the decision to oust Ngcobo was taken by a board resolution, which is under review by the high court.\n\nHe declined to answer further questions sent by City Press, including whether a criminal case was opened over the alleged manhandling.\n\n\u201cThe board resolution taken to dismiss Mbusiswa Ngcobo from Abasa is subject to review in the high court and is pending possible litigation. Therefore, we are not in any position to comment on the matter at this juncture,\u201d Gidini said.\n\nCandy confirmed that the court papers for the lawsuit would be issued soon.\n\n\u201cThe papers are being finalised by counsel and we should be in a position to issue it to the high court within the next few days,\u201d Candy said.\n\nAbout the court review application, Ngcobo said he was of the view that the issue of leadership should always be left to members.\n\n\u201cNo single individual within Abasa should ever think they are above the membership, so I am respecting that.\n\n\u201cIn due course, I will consult the membership as to whether they think I should resign or wait for the end of my term of office, which is in just under 12 months\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cEven if certain members are aggrieved, as they are, by the factional behaviour of certain individuals, it will be important to allow them to decide on what should happen to my role at the organisation over the next 12 months. The members and their wishes and desires must be respected by all leaders,\u201d Ngcobo said.", "description": "The axed president of the Advancement of Black Accountants in SA (Abasa), Mbusiswa Ngcobo, has threatened to sue the organisation\u2019s leaders for R500 000 for allegedly lying to oust him.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8715/d6ea9a37ae7447e6ac50e6729619b8b9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
