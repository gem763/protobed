They had complained of being overworked, and when their request for more lenient schedule was denied, they took matters into their own hands \u2013 spending an entire day admiring the view from the windows and doing little else.\n\n\u201cWe had been overscheduled,\u201d astronaut William Pogue later wrote. \u201cWe were just hustling the whole day. The work could be tiresome and tedious, though the view was spectacular.\u201d\n\nTheir defiance came just over halfway through an 84-day mission. The astronauts later referred to the incident as their \u201cstrike\u201d, others called it a \u201cmutiny\u201d. Either way, it was one of the first indications that prolonged trips into space were going to bring extra challenges that hadn\u2019t surfaced in the relatively quick visits astronauts had previously undertaken.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nAs humans get more serious about going to Mars, one of the biggest threats to such a mission could come from the psychological state of the crewmembers themselves.\n\nResearchers are looking to Antarctica to test how our mental health will respond to long-haul space travel. It\u2019s a good analogue for several reasons: it\u2019s dark, with the South Pole having several months of total night over winter, taking away the day-night cycle we\u2019re used to; it\u2019s bitterly cold, with temperatures reaching -80C (-112F) so going outside is difficult. Then there\u2019s the isolation. It\u2019s physically isolated \u2013 depending on where exactly you are, evacuation over winter might be impossible. And it\u2019s socially isolated \u2013 you live in close quarters with the same few people day-in, day-out.\n\nThe Skylab mutiny could have been an example of the \u201cthird quarter phenomenon\u201d reported by polar explorers and others. This occurs when people realise they have as long left in their inescapable situation as they have already lived through, and lose motivation. Though not everyone agrees it exists, the phenomenon does appear to show up in various situations, including simulated space missions.", "description": "If we are to settle the Solar System astronauts will have to travel for months and years.
