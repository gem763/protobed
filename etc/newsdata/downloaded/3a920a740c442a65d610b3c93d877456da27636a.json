It was his third goal in four matches for France, but his header was cancelled out late on by Kaan Ayhan in a 1-1 draw.\n\nGiroud had scored an important winner against Iceland on Friday but Deschamps did not feel he could manage two starts in four days, having managed just 187 minutes for his club this season.\n\nOlivier Giroud scored off the bench for France but could not inspire a victory against Turkey\n\nHis Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has left him on the bench for a majority of the season so far, with striker Tammy Abraham the joint-top scorer in the Premier League with eight goals.\n\nBut Deschamps wants to see Giroud playing more minutes for his club, and hinted he may have to ply his trade elsewhere.\n\n'You know, Olivier suffers his situation. Before January, nothing will move,' Deschamps told a press conference.\n\n'After, it will be up to him to see. I hope he will have more playing time.\n\n'But we cannot take away his goals, his good performances. He scores, he makes others play well.\n\n'He knows he is under pressure, but he always responds.'\n\nFrance boss Didier Deschamps has praised Giroud's goal-scoring consistency on the pitch\n\nFrance laboured at home to Turkey, who remain Group H leaders ahead of their opponents on 19 points because of a superior head-to-head record after a 2-0 win in Konya in June.\n\nThey had 23 shots but only nine were on target, producing only one goal.\n\n'We did everything we needed to win that game,' Deschamps said. 'We had the chances, they didn't, but it is what it is. It's a good point. We'll have to finish the job in November.\n\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard has opted for Tammy Abraham over Giroud as his main striker\n\n'We are the two best teams in the group. Qualifiers are always complicated, it's a long road.\n\n'We should have been more efficient. They defended a lot and they deserve to be where they are.'\n\nFrance face Moldova next month while Turkey host third-placed Iceland.", "description": "Giroud came off the bench in France's Euro 2020 qualifier against Turkey and scored within four minutes, but his header was cancelled out by Kaan Ayhan in a 1-1 draw.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19716138-0-image-a-80_1571096133680.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
