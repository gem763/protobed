(CVE:FMS) Insiders Buy Up More Shares?", "language": "en", "text": "We've lost count of how many times insiders have accumulated shares in a company that goes on to improve markedly. The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Focus Graphite Inc. (CVE:FMS).\n\nWhat Is Insider Selling?\n\nIt is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, rules govern insider transactions, and certain disclosures are required.\n\nWe don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.'\n\nSee our latest analysis for Focus Graphite\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Focus Graphite\n\nChairman of the Board Jeffrey York made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for CA$100k worth of shares at a price of CA$0.05 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being CA$0.025). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Jeffrey York was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.\n\nYou can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.
