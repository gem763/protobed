It was followed by Harvard, Columbia, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale.\n\nThe analysis looks at 1,400 colleges and universities and ranks them on student outcomes such as graduation rates; faculty resources like class sizes; expert opinion from fellow educators; alumni giving and student excellence such as incoming student SAT and ACT scores.\n\nPrinceton scored highly on a number of measures, including a student-faculty ratio of just 5-to-1, a high graduation rate of 98%, and a high alumni giving rate of 59%. But it also comes with a high sticker price: upwards of $73,450 a year, which could \u2014 if you graduate in the expected four years \u2014 hit over $293,000 total. (Harvard\u2019s sticker price is very similar, as are many other top-tier schools).\n\nThe good news: Many students and their families don\u2019t have to pay full sticker price. One reason: \u201cPrinceton has a generous financial aid policy,\u201d U.S. News\u2019 chief data strategist Robert Morse tells MarketWatch. What\u2019s more, Princeton has one of the lowest levels of debt for graduates of any university, with just 4% of graduates graduating with debt at a median level of just $7,500.\n\n10 best national universities\n\n1.

Indeed, according to Federal Reserve data from 2018, \u201cover half of young adults who went to college took on some debt, including student loans, for their education\u201d with the typical amount of debt being between $20,000 and $25,000. Americans now collectively owe an estimated $1.5 trillion in student-loan debt.", "description": "Princeton, Harvard, Columbia, MIT, Yale are among the top schools in U.S. News\u2019 new ranking.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GI888_colleg_ZG_20180509163425.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
