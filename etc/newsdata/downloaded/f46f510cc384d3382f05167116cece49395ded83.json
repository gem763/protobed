The Israeli prime minister\u2019s page had called on voters to prevent the establishment of a government composed of \u201cArabs who want to destroy us all \u2013 women, children and men\u201d, provoking uproar among opposition politicians.\n\nIn an interview with Kan Reshet Bet radio, Netanyahu denied writing the post, which was subsequently removed, saying it was a staffer\u2019s mistake.\n\nNetanyahu is fighting for his political survival ahead of elections next week and has been shoring up nationalist votes with incendiary language and hardline promises.\n\nOn Tuesday he announced he would annex large swaths of occupied Palestinian territories if he was re-elected, a move that for decades has been considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians\u2019 aspirations of statehood.\n\nRussia denounces Netanyahu's West Bank annexation plan Read more\n\nLast week he drew outrage from opposition parties with a push for last-minute legislation that would allow party officials to bring cameras to polling stations.\n\nHis critics labelled it a naked attempt to depress turnout among Israel\u2019s Arab population, as it could intimidate many into staying away. They also pointed out that it could serve to energise Netanyahu\u2019s base of rightwing voters due to his warnings \u2013 so far unfounded \u2013 that the election could be stolen.\n\nNetanyahu insisted that he was only interested in protecting the integrity of the vote and preventing fraud. On Wednesday a bill allowing parties to place cameras in polling stations failed in the Knesset.\n\nHe has used similar tactics in the past, including warning on election day in 2015 that Israeli Arabs were voting in \u201cdroves\u201d, a comment for which he later apologised.", "description": "Israeli PM has denied writing inflammatory post about \u2018Arabs who want to destroy us all\u2019", "authors": ["Agencies In Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a572fce1b0f2daa04fcb4a357ae4bee274949815/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=18afbfad98a2f4dd045ccb4e6396610d", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
