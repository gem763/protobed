In response, Trump posted a tweet claiming to support reform and attacked Legend for not backing his plan last year. Then, the president took a shot at the EGOT winner\u2019s wife, Teigen, but without using her name:\n\n....musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\n.....the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it...And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t lost on Teigen that Trump tagged Legend in his tweet, but not her. And she let him have it:\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nLuna, remember the night before your first day of school? When mommy was making your sign and the pussy ass bitch president had his 9th meltdown of the day pic.twitter.com/ZFZHJYrDPG \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nthe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I'm cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a bitch pic.twitter.com/9ZkV7bh4FA \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nMinutes later, Legend also fired back:\n\nImagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody--ANYBODY--will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nYour country needs you, Melania \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nTeigen has been a constant critic of Trump and his policies, to the point of being blocked by him on Twitter.\n\nTeigen and Legend began trending almost immediately after Trump\u2019s attack. But the couple tried to get another term trending instead:\n\nno guys no please do not make this trend, for it is my fight with #PresidentPussyAssBitch, not yours!!!!!! https://t.co/hSJ0UxjbaO \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nPlease don't make this foul mouthed hashtag trend #PresidentPussyAssBitch https://t.co/TMaq58hzIx \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nThe president\u2019s critics were only too happy to play along, even if the NSFW nature of the nickname made it unlikely to trend:\n\nThis exchange between Chrissy Teigen and #PresidentPussyAssBitch should be placed in the Smithsonian because it's a very important part of our history as a people. pic.twitter.com/O0gwa8w1YM \u2014 Marie Connor (@thistallawkgirl) September 9, 2019\n\nDonald Trump vs. Chrissy Teigen (sound up) pic.twitter.com/RMQi12VFID \u2014 ElElegante101 (@skolanach) September 9, 2019\n\nMe walking around with @chrissyteigen from now on. pic.twitter.com/6R3vhgwqgt \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) September 9, 2019\n\nIf @johnlegend & @chrissyteigen don't want #PresidentPussyAssBitch to trend then we must respect their wishes during this difficult time. https://t.co/bf2bEfrUeV \u2014 W.

Whatever Trump is really hiding to distract us with all this stuff must be huge. \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 9, 2019\n\nNo American president should ever call anyone \u201cfilthy-mouthed,\u201d like Trump just did to Chrissy Teigen. It\u2019s beneath the office of the presidency, like everything Trump does. Trump is an international disgrace. Chrissy is a patriot. Anyone who says anything different is a liar. \u2014 Scott Dworkin (@funder) September 9, 2019\n\nChrissy Teigen\u2019s \u201cpussy ass bitch\u201d reply is the only thing will ever top Lebron\u2019s \u201cU Bum\u201d! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 very legal & very cool (@Msaderhold) September 9, 2019\n\nOh, I\u2019ve lived this game.
