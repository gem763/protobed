The Popeyes phenomenon kicked off social media debates over whose spicy chicken \u2014 Popeyes or Chick-fil-A, even Wendy\u2019s \u2014 ruled the roost.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s entry seems to be an amalgamation of various spare parts lying around the company garage: the same buttermilk chicken fillet as in its standard crispy chicken sandwich, a sesame-dotted bun that could alternatively house a Big Mac and a lightly spicy barbecue sauce, onions and pickles that instantly bring to mind a McRib.\n\n[Yes, the Popeyes chicken sandwich is great. Here\u2019s how it stacks up against the competition.]\n\nEven if it instantly seems familiar, the McDonald\u2019s sandwich also feels a little tardy to the party. It comes not only on the heels (or should it be tail feathers?) of the viral Popeyes offering, but after franchisees pushed the company to come up with a premium chicken sandwich to rival Chick-fil-A\u2019s, CNBC reported in July.\n\n\n\n(Matt Brooks/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the sandwich is not exactly a direct clap-back to Popeyes. \u201cThis has been in the works for some time as McDonald\u2019s is always looking for ways to innovate and meet customer demands,\u201d a McDonald\u2019s rep wrote in an email. Still, it looks like the chain\u2019s future is very chicken-y. A news release this month announcing the upcoming new spicy options called them \u201cjust the latest evolution in McDonald\u2019s chicken offerings\u201d and offered a tease: \u201cAnd we can\u2019t wait to show you what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nPeter Saleh, a managing director and restaurants analyst at financial services firm BTIG, says talk about a chicken sandwich war is overblown. \u201cIt\u2019s just a chicken sandwich. It\u2019s nothing new,\u201d he says, referring to the Popeyes-prompted chicken obsession. There\u2019s long been an overall trend away from beef and toward chicken, he notes, and McDonald\u2019s has introduced and discontinued many chicken offerings.\n\nBasically, Saleh thinks this all might just be a flash in the frying pan. \u201cThe takeaway is that the viral nature of some of these marketing tactics is very powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd traditional means of marketing might not be as effective.\u201d\n\nIn a new TV ad and on its menu, McDonald\u2019s describes the new sandwich, along with its new spicy barbecue-sauce-glazed tenders, as having \u201cthe flavor that makes you go \u2018woo!\u2019 \u201d But that\u2019s not exactly the reaction it\u2019s prompting. \u201cYou\u2019re better off just bringing a bun to Popeyes,\u201d food site Eater tweeted, a reference to Popeyes\u2019 suggestion that people make a DIY version of the chicken chain\u2019s sold-out sandwich. Concluded one online reviewer: \u201cmediocre.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d rank it higher than that, though it doesn\u2019t approach the Popeyes spicy chicken\u2019s holy-grail deliciousness. The patty was incredibly juicy (just like with Kylie Jenner\u2019s pillowy lips, I wonder whether injections are involved) and the sauce pleasantly smoky. Underwhelming pickles didn\u2019t provide the tangy counterpoint I\u2019d hope for, but after thinking I would just nibble for taste-testing purposes, I wound up eating the whole dang thing.\n\nAll of which is to say the new sandwich didn\u2019t make me say \u201cwoo!\u201d so much as simply \u201coverdue.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nKFC\u2019s Cheetos chicken sandwich looks toxic and tastes like a missed opportunity\n\nThe key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world\n\nWe did it, America. We ate Popeyes out of chicken sandwiches.", "description": "The fast-food chain claims it's a \u201cflavor that will make you go 'woo!'\"", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Co-Author Of The Reliable Source", "September At Am", "Emily Heil Is A Reporter Covering National Food News", "Trends.
