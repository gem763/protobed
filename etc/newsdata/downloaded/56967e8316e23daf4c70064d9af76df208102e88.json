Gen X, which includes former and current prime ministers Boris Johnson, David Cameron and Scott Morrison, have flown under the radar \u2013 as millennials and boomers engage in decades of tedious generational warfare.\n\nThis invisibility has so far meant that blame for the climate emergency has not been directed at Xers. But that is changing. Gen X is in power and it is obvious that this cohort has squandered 30 years where they could have taken action \u2013 at a structural and personal level.\n\nThe question is why?\n\nPart of it is the underlying DNA of a generation that came of age in a time of high irony and profound nihilism, and partly it is because of good old-fashioned self-interest. Just like boomers, it turns out that Gen X also wants all the things.\n\nProtest movements were neutered\n\nIt\u2019s not that Gen X didn\u2019t take the streets and protest \u2013 it\u2019s just that when they did, the protests were either cannibalised or cauterised.\n\nAnti-globalisation protests raged throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, bringing attention to global human rights issues and systems that needed structural reform. But these protests were interrupted by 9/11, the so-called war on terror, and never really got back on track.\n\nGen X has survived its gloomy formative years. Now we will have to deal with climate change | Jason Wilson Read more\n\nAnd in more subtle ways, the protests and Gen X culture were cannibalised by the market. Brands started interacting with the counterculture \u2013 sponsoring music festivals and working with street artists, Nike marketed environmentally friendly shoes and CK One with its low-key packaging and downbeat models was the choice of fragrance for the No Logo generation.\n\nThen there was Iraq.\n\nWhen millions took to the streets around the world, something curious and unsettling happened \u2013 leaders discovered they could dismiss the protesters without any significant electoral blowback.\n\nAs hundreds of thousands of people gathered in central Sydney in 2003 to protest Australia\u2019s involvement in the Iraq war, the Greens senator Bob Brown told the Sydney Morning Herald: \u201cThis is going to send a message to our Prime Minister (John Howard) that he cannot ignore.\u201d\n\nBut he \u2013 like governments around the world \u2013 did ignore it, saying at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t know that you can measure public opinion just by the number of people that turn up at demonstrations.\u201d\n\nHe was re-elected for a fourth term in 2004.\n\nIt would be 16 years until the climate strikes \u2013 led by Gen Z \u2013 eclipsed the number of people marching against the Iraq war, an indicator that a generation that should have maintained their rage had lost its steam, or perhaps had just lost heart.\n\nAddiction to cheap flights\n\nPublished in 1996, the ultimate Gen X novel was Alex Garland\u2019s The Beach. There was something allegorical in the story, like a 1990s Lord of the Flies. In it, a British backpacker in south-east Asia tries to find somewhere unspoilt, not tainted by that ultimate boomer invention: The Lonely Planet Guide.\n\nOf course what happens is when he does find a hidden tropical paradise, it is inevitably spoilt by selfish humans.\n\nIn a way, that is what Gen X did to the world \u2013 taking pride in exploring and being an independent traveller rather than a tourist \u2013 but in the end, wrecking what they loved.\n\nThe decade following the publication of The Beach would see an explosion of cheap travel that Gen Xers quickly took up without question.\n\nRyanair\u2019s profits over this time tell the story: rising from \u20ac231m in 1998 to \u20ac1.8bn in 2003 and to \u20ac3bn in 2010.\n\nGen Xers became and remained addicted to cheap travel even when we were made aware of the damage that emissions from flights did to the environment. Personal escapism remains more highly prized than collective responsibility. Alex Garland summed up the mindset in The Beach: \u201cEscape through travel works.\u201d\n\n\u2026 and big houses\n\nTravel around the outer edge of any city to the newer estates and you\u2019ll see housing that is in a way representative of the mess we have found ourselves in.\n\nThese houses are built right up to the hilt of the block, with no trees, little green space or shade and sometimes overlapping gutters with their neighbours. They rely on air conditioning rather than smart design to keep cool. In the quest for ownership, personal space and comfort (all individual quests) Gen X have continued an ignoble boomer tradition of squandering an opportunity not only to make housing more equitable and affordable for all \u2013 but to embrace building sustainability in a way that lessens the contribution to climate change and ameliorates some of its effects.\n\nRob Sindel, the managing director of construction materials provider CSR, told the Sydney Morning Herald in 2018 he estimates most of Australia\u2019s 9m homes would have just an environmental one-star rating.\n\nGen X can\u2019t claim ignorance on environmental destruction \u2013 we grew up worried about CFCs and the hole in the ozone layer. The climate emergency has been a long time coming, yet rather than act in our younger years to reform systems that cause the problems we have followed the baby boomers into an unsustainable way of life that prioritises personal comfort and personal wealth creation (often through the acquisition of private property) over the collective good and the health of the planet.\n\nAddicted to distraction\n\nGen X fell asleep at the wheel during the last decade or so when structural change could and should have happened, in part because of the surge in distraction. The internet became mainstream in the 1990s and smartphones and social media in the mid-2000s. Like everyone, Gen X lost their shit. After all this is the generation that still had a lived experience of using telephone boxes.\n\nThe focus and drive that is needed to fight for and implement major structural reforms to prevent a climate emergency were dulled through weapons of mass distraction and box sets followed by streaming culture.\n\nBut then again, Gen Xer\u2019s martyred saint, Kurt Cobain, gloomily predicted this for our generation \u2013 \u201cHere we are now entertain us.\u201d", "description": "Cheap travel, big houses, neutered protest movements \u2013 Gen X like to think they are nihilistic but they have followed the boomers", "authors": ["Brigid Delaney"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cfa16a3b43047d6595dd22b4f747ac3f907b8e9/0_97_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d7363bd9d5d49974ab7595c2e5725a9e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
