(Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)\n\nMy guess is that President Donald Trump did Attorney General William Barr a grave disservice by conflating two distinct inquiries in his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBarr is looking into the origins of the Russian collusion investigation, to see if U.S. law enforcement officials got ahead of the evidence and, if so, why. There are threads to that story that lead to Ukraine.\n\nThis is an official inquiry. It is legitimate and important. There is nothing untoward about the president of this country asking the president of Ukraine to cooperate with than inquiry.\n\nAs recently released text messages suggest, the second inquiry appears to be spearheaded by Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. The subject of this inquiry is the Bidens, and whether there was anything other than the self-evident personal enrichment involved in the appointment of Joe Biden\u2019s son to the board of a Ukrainian energy company at the same time that Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s point man for the country.\n\nRudy Giuliani's inquiry is suspect\n\nAsking the Ukrainian president to cooperate with his personal lawyer in an investigation of a political rival, as Trump did, is wholly inappropriate.\n\nNow, I believe these were actually two separate tracks. Thus far, there is no evidence that Barr has been involved in the effort to investigate the activities of the Bidens in Ukraine. The Department of Justice issued a statement that Barr hadn\u2019t been asked by Trump to contact anyone in Ukraine.\n\nBut in the conversation with Zelensky, Trump treated Barr and Giuliani interchangeably. In fact, in Trump\u2019s part of the dialogue dealing with the Bidens, he specifically refers to working with the attorney general.\n\nExcuse after excuse: Republicans should be ashamed of their silence on Trump's call for China to go after Biden\n\nTrump is not known as a master of detail or nuance. He routinely conflates the official with the personal. It would not be a surprise if he treated, and regarded, all inquiries involving Ukraine as related and interchangeable.\n\nIf I\u2019m right, then Barr has been wrongly dragged into this controversy.\n\nThe key to understanding the full context of Trump\u2019s use of the presidency to induce a foreign government to investigate a political rival lies with Giuliani and his interactions with Ukrainian officials. That\u2019s where the congressional investigative focus should be.\n\nWhat Trump did, even in his own account of it, is a troubling misuse of the office of the president.\n\nYet the import of this continues to be lost in the overreaction of the traditional media and Democrats to all other things Trump.\n\nWilliam Barr's inquiry is legit\n\nAs mentioned, Barr is conducting an inquiry into the origins of the Russian collusion investigation. This is an official governmental endeavor and entirely legitimate.\n\nTrump asked Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to cooperate with Barr\u2019s inquiry.\n\nThis was breathlessly reported as Trump asking another foreign leader to do something that would benefit him politically.\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board: Impeachment 'a manufactured crisis'? Yes, Donald Trump faces a storm of his own making\n\nJust because something will benefit Trump politically doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t legitimate government business or an appropriate exercise of his presidential prerogatives. All politicians hope that their official actions benefit them politically and endeavor mightily to make it so.\n\nAustralia\u2019s cooperation with Barr\u2019s inquiry is important. One of the early sources that led to the Russian collusion investigation was an Australian diplomat.\n\nBarr has asked Trump to contact the heads of other governments to open doors for his inquiry. That\u2019s an appropriate, and useful, protocol.\n\nThe important distinction we're not making\n\nNow, if Barr\u2019s inquiry establishes that U.S. law enforcement, particularly the FBI, deployed investigative techniques unwarranted by the evidence in hand, that would bolster Trump\u2019s political claim that the Russian collusion investigation was a witch hunt.\n\nThat the inquiry may end up helping Trump politically doesn\u2019t render it unnecessary or illegitimate.\n\nThere is a world of difference between Trump asking foreign leaders to help Barr, a government officer, with an official inquiry into official action by the U.S. government, and Trump asking a foreign leader to work with his private attorney on an investigation into one of his political opponents.\n\nThe failure of the traditional media and Democrats to make such distinctions is one of the reasons the inappropriateness of the Ukrainian request hasn\u2019t had the impact it should, at least as of yet.\n\nThis really is the fable of the boy crying wolf coming to life.\n\nRobert Robb is a columnist at the Arizona Republic, where this column originally appeared.
