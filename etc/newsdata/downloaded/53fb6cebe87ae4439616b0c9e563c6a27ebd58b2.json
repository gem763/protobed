The chaotic scene was one of many across the city, as some protesters battled with police, vandalized mainland-linked businesses and train stations, and set fire to at least one train.\n\nMany businesses were closed on Saturday, the start of a three-day weekend, as the city mopped up after the violence. Supermarkets that were open had long queues as shoppers stocked up on supplies. The protests followed warnings from opposition leaders that Lam\u2019s decision to invoke a colonial-era emergency law to impose the ban would only further anger critics.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest (all times local):\n\nHKMA dismisses speculation (6:20 p.m.)\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city\u2019s de facto central bank, dismissed speculation in social media on Saturday, which it described as a \u201cmalicious attempt to cause panic among the public.\u201d\n\nThe city has a \u201crobust and sound\u201d banking system with ample liquidity, the HKMA said in a statement. It is well positioned to withstand any market volatilities and has sufficient supply of banknotes to meet the needs of the public, it said.\n\nPolice detain two (5:15 p.m.)\n\nPolice detained two people with face masks in a square in Central, RTHK reported. At least one other person was arrested after a peaceful procession by demonstrators. Riot police started appearing on the streets after marchers split up when they reached Chater Garden, their destination in Central. Some linked up in a human chain while others sang and chanted slogans in parks and squares.\n\nBank group apologizes (5 p.m.)\n\nThe Hong Kong Association of Banks said some banks had shut branches and suspended services to repair damage, and to ensure the safety of customers and staff.\n\nThe association expressed regret over the situation and apologized for the inconvenience. It said in a statement that it condemns the violent acts across the city and and hopes social order will be restored quickly \u201cfollowing the introduction of the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation.\u201d\n\nTrain services suspended (3:15 p.m.)\n\nThe city\u2019s train services will be suspended for the rest of Saturday, with the exception of the Airport Express, according to operator MTR Corp. Train services had been halted Friday night. This was the first time the service has been shut down since 2007, when the company merged with Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway Corporation, MTR said.\n\nMasked marchers (2 p.m)\n\nHundreds of Hong Kong protesters defied the ban on masks as they marched from Victoria Park, Causeway Bay, to Central. Fewer people took part in the procession than recent demonstrations after one of the most violent weeks since the unrest began in June.\n\n\u2018Everyone is scared\u2019: Lam (1 p.m.)\n\nHong Kong leader Lam said \u201ceveryone is worried and scared\u201d after Friday\u2019s clashes, which was \u201ca very dark day.\u201d The chief executive said in a recorded televised address that the city was experiencing unprecedented violence and that she cannot allow a small minority to destroy people\u2019s freedoms.\n\nThe government will \u201ccurb the violence with the greatest determination,\u201d she said, calling on people to support it and to condemn the violence.\n\nBanks, stores shut (7 a.m.)\n\nThe ParknShop supermarket and Watsons retail chains, as well as some of China\u2019s biggest state-owned lenders shut almost all their locations for the day. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. closed their branches in Hong Kong, while Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. said it would only keep one open. Even 7-Eleven, known to be open around the clock, announced on its website that all stores will close at 5 p.m., as did the Wellcome supermarket chain.\n\nOne person shot (2:45 a.m.)\n\nA plain-clothes policeman fired a shot that injured a person at about 9 p.m. on Friday after the officer was attacked and beaten by protesters, Yolanda Yu, a police senior superintendent, said a press conference early Saturday morning.
