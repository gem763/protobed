(Credit: Daryn Sturch)\n\nA video of nearly 30 bikers in jeans and leather vests queuing up at a young girl\u2019s lemonade stand is a pretty remarkable sight on its own. But the heartwarming story behind this seemingly dichotomous moment is what\u2019s pushed the footage to go viral. It involves the girl and her mother helping several of the motorcyclists out after an accident last year, and the resulting, enduring bond.\n\n\u201cBest lemonade in the state! Last year my daughter and granddaughter pulled up on a motorcycle accident that involved several of the men and women of this group,\u201d reads a Facebook post of the video, from Denver, Ind. \u201cEver since then they\u2019ve been so wonderful to my family. Today they came by for lemonade to surprise my granddaughter.\u201d\n\nIt was Sept. 2, 2018, when Daryn Sturch, a nurse, and her daughter Bryanne, came upon an accident involving several motorcyclist from a crew called the Milwaukee Iron. Sturch quickly jumped into action, likely saving lives in the process.\n\n\u201cI stayed with them and did the best I could to triage them and keep them awake and calm,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle, adding that all five bikers involved in the crash had sustained fairly \u201cgruesome\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d injuries.\n\nAfter the accident, Sturch, 37, began receiving an outpouring of thank you messages from some of the bikers associated with the Milwaukee Iron. The bikers sent Sturch updates on the recovery of those who had been injured, and have kept in touch with her ever since.\n\nFast forward to nearly a year later, when Bryanne, 8, decided to set up a lemonade stand to raise money to buy equipment for her horse. Her mom announced the sale on Facebook,.\n\nA biker saw the post and commented, asking if there would be a good place to park motorcycles if some of the club members were to stop by. But Sturch never expected to see the crew of nearly 30 bikers rumble over to the stand.\n\n\u201cMy daughter could not believe it and was over-the-moon excited,\u201d she says. \u201cShe thinks they are the nicest people in the world.\u201d\n\nThe stand also provided a place for reunion between Sturch and the motorcyclists she\u2019d aided, some of whom she had not seen since the accident.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the bikers who I\u2019d helped would be at the stand, so seeing them again was extremely overwhelming,\u201d she says, noting that the moment she reconnected with a rider called Lumpy brought tears to her eyes.\n\n\u201cI remember trying to help him and him telling me \u2018I\u2019m fine hun, I want you to go check on and take care of the girls.\u2019 He was more worried about the girls who were injured than anyone else,\u201d Sturch recalls. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful they are doing so well.\u201d\n\nView photos Daryn Sturch reunited with some of the very bikers whose lives she saved at her daughter's lemonade stand. (Daryn Sturch) More\n\nAs the video of the bikers at Bryanne\u2019s stand racks up thousands of views on Facebook, Sturch has high hopes for a meaningful takeaway.\n\n\u201cIt is important to me that people understand that good people are all around us,\u201d she says, \u201cand that just because someone doesn\u2019t look or dress the way you do doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have the same core values.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\u2022 Cops called to shut down kid's lemonade stand buy drinks instead\n\n\u2022 Boy, 6, donates money he saved for Disney trip to help feed Dorian evacuees\n\n\u2022 Heartwarming video shows customer leaving employees $200 tip at local frozen custard stand\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "But the heartwarming story behind this seemingly dichotomous moment is what\u2019s pushed the footage to go viral.", "authors": ["Paulina Cachero"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/itni5CKNooplN2TljqpixQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a1138ae0-da42-11e9-bfab-cfe992d583ac", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
