The chairmen said any resistance would be considered evidence of obstruction of justice, a threat they\u2019ve levied on the rest of the Trump administration this week.\n\nWith the inquiry centered on the Ukrainian incident, House Democrats have subpoenaed the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the White House itself.\n\nMr. Pence is sticking with the president, defending his requests to have foreign government investigate the Biden family.\n\n\u201cThe American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
