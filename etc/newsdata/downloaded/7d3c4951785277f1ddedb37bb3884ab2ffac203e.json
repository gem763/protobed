Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPerhaps that is why she calls herself \u201can older young player.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t call myself a veteran. I just call myself... a player that maybe has some experience probably, a little bit more than for my age,\u201d the Swiss told reporters at Flushing Meadows, after downing her quarter-final opponent Donna Vekic 7-6(5) 6-3 on Wednesday.\n\nBencic, ranked 12 in the world, burst onto the scene at the U.S. Open five years ago as a protege of compatriot Hingis\u2019 mother, Melanie Molitor, and captured the imagination of tennis\u2019 fickle fanbase eager to spot the sport\u2019s next big thing.\n\nYet after becoming the youngest player to reach the tournament\u2019s quarters since Hingis, who went on to win five Grand Slam singles titles, a series of injuries in subsequent years saw her fall out of the spotlight.\n\nHaving climbed to number seven in the world rankings in 2016, she dropped to 165 at the end of the following year.\n\n\u201cPeople always think I\u2019m a little bit older than I actually am, because I\u2019ve been here since 16, 17,\u201d Bencic said after beating holder and top seed Naomi Osaka earlier this week.\n\n\u201cEveryone expected (me) to go just up. That\u2019s not how tennis goes.\n\n\u201cI think all true athletes have to overcome obstacles, injuries, just tough times.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, Bencic is enjoying the view after an arduous climb back to the top.\n\n\u201cI was dreaming, of course, about this day coming, but you never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about it. You\u2019re just right in the moment.\u201d\n\nWhile her win against Vekic was relatively straightforward, there were still some nervy moments for her father Ivan, a former pro hockey player who serves as her coach.\n\n\u201cEven in the tough times he\u2019s still my father,\u201d said Bencic. \u201cI think he almost died today by heart attack.\u201d", "description": "From a 17-year-old U.S. Open quarter-finalist and heir apparent to Martina Hingis to a battled-hardened 22-year-old poised to enter her first-ever Grand Slam semi-final, Belinda Bencic has packed a wealth of experience into her deceptively short career.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426315040&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832F0"}
