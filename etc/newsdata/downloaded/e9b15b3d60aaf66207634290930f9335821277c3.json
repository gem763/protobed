There certainly were some hiccups along the way, but most of those who participated seemed satisfied with the experience.\n\n\u201cI was talking to people all throughout the day, and everyone sort of had the same reaction, where they were like, \u2018It's such a historic moment to be able to vote early for the first time and on the very first day,\u201d said Jennifer Wilson, state deputy director for the League of Women Voters.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of our people that things were going pretty well,\u201d said Dustin Czarny, the chair of the New York State Election Commissioners Association\u2019s Democratic caucus. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re putting new technologies into the field, you\u2019re going to run into some snags. But that\u2019s another reason for doing early voting; you have nine days, and if you have a problem, people can come back. Getting this first day out of the way, I think things are going to go much smoother after this.\u201d\n\nPolls are open at a select number of locations in each county until Sunday, Nov. 3. They\u2019ll reopen for the regularly scheduled general election on Nov. 5.\n\nPOLITICO visited six polling sites spread throughout the eastern half of the state. Here\u2019s what we saw.\n\nCrown Heights, 10 a.m.\n\nAs the sponsor of the bill that created early voting, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie (D-Brooklyn) was a logical candidate to be the first person to cast a ballot in his corner of the city. Myrie showed up before the polls opened, and became the first voter to enter the school cafeteria where the election was being conducted. He signed his name on one of the new electronic poll books, which are designed to create and print custom ballots for voters based on their specific district.\n\nNothing came out of the printer.\n\nA swarm of election workers scrambled to fix the flashy new device. The other nine machines were working seamlessly, so numerous other voters were able to cast their ballots while Myrie spent about 15 minutes chatting with constituents.\n\nThe solution turned out to be simple: The ballot had been printed, but was sent to a printer on the other side of the room.\n\nDespite the speed bump, Myrie was heartened by the experience, particularly the fact that there were 18 people ready to vote before the doors opened.\n\n\u201cI was so excited to see so many of our neighbors coming out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting for me, because \u2026 we passed this bill in January and it gets signed into law in January, and I get to see the effects of what that means for our community right now.\u201d\n\nMichael Ryan, executive director of the New York City Board of Elections, was at the same polling site, and echoed those sentiments.\n\n\u201cAs with any first-time implementation there are challenges, but I\u2019m impressed with the number of people that have shown up,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a positive development for voters in the city of New York.\u201d\n\nPark Slope, 10:52 a.m.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, no stranger to YMCAs in Brooklyn, cast his ballot with first lady Chirlane McCray at the Park Slope Armory YMCA. He lauded the experience and encouraged his constituents to similarly head to the polls.\n\n\u201cIt's amazing. Everyone needs to vote early,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go in, there's no lines. It's easy. It's a whole new world.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio wore a blue \u201cI voted early\u201d bracelet that was distributed by poll workers to supplement the traditional stickers. He predicted the new practice will bring an end to the dysfunction that usually surrounds voting in New York City.\n\n\u201cI feel like we finally stepped into the 21st century in New York,\u201d he said. \u201c[For] years and years we've been frustrated that people got turned away from poll sites, that they found voting to be a bad experience instead of a good experience, that the long lines discouraged people. Those days are over. It's a whole new day here in New York City, in New York State. And it's wonderful and it's easy.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman Felix Ortiz (D-Brooklyn) coincidentally showed up to the YMCA at the same time. He predicted the new practice will result in higher turnout.\n\n\u201cThis is a first step in the right direction,\u201d Oritz said. \u201cFinally we\u2019ve seen people coming out and I hope that the next eight days will show that early voting will continue to empower our community and our people.\u201d\n\nCo-op City, 12:25 p.m.\n\nA reporter and a hopeful voter who identified himself only as Mr. Adams showed up at the same time at an address for Truman High School provided by the Board of Elections. They followed a series of arrows and signs that took them on a circuitous route around a series of adjacent schools, and at one point, led them to a dead end.\n\nThe school\u2019s gym \u2014 which would have been found much quicker had the first signs pointed in the opposite direction \u2014 was relatively quiet during the midday voting hours. Two voters gave drastically different reviews about their experiences.\n\n\u201cSo great, so good,\u201d said a woman who said her name was Sandra. \u201cIt\u2019s simpler.\n\nBut Mr. Adams\u2019 travails didn\u2019t end once he finally found the entrance.\n\n\u201cAll the mailings they sent me a couple of weeks ago said that I should come to the high school for early voting,\u201d he said. \u201cYet now they told me that I do not belong at this site. I have to go to 190 Hollywood Ave. in Throgs Neck. I have to get in my car and drive there. That's ridiculous.\u201d\n\nDoes that leave him optimistic for the future of early voting?\n\n\u201cIt depends on who down at the Board of Elections [is] responsible for this,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cYou're going to have a lot of early voters very disenchanted with the process because they're sending wrong information to the voters.\u201d\n\nWhite Plains, 1:25 p.m.\n\n\u201cLike anything else, it will have a little hiccup but overall, it's been good,\u201d said Reginald Lafayette, Westchester\u2019s Democratic Board of Elections commissioner and the county party\u2019s chair.\n\n\u201cYou all find the experience has been good, right?\u201d he asked some voters.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d one of them replied.\n\n\u201cIt was excellent,\u201d Lafayette said.\n\nThe commissioner estimated that about 60 people had shown up to the White Plains site about 90 minutes after the county\u2019s polls opened at noon, but stressed that it was too soon to know if early voting would increase turnout.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s one of the big selling points, [but] it\u2019s super hard to know,\u201d he said.\n\nMonroe, 2:30 p.m.\n\nPolls in Orange County were open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Turnout was low at Monroe Town Hall, seemingly numbering in the low dozens as operations were wrapping up.\n\nLike in much of the state, the low number may have been related to the lack of competitive elections. There were a handful of judicial and town offices on the ballots, but several weren\u2019t even contested.\n\nThe lack of activity may also have been particular to this polling site: It covered residents of Monroe as well as the new town of Palm Tree, created out of the Hasidic enclave of Kiryas Joel. It\u2019s highly unlikely members of that community would cast a ballot on a Saturday.\n\nThe one voter who did show up during the final half hour of balloting was happy with the experience.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make it during the week because of my work hours at this time of the year,\u201d said the voter, who identified himself as Bruce. \u201cSo this is great [and] very convenient.\u201d\n\nRhinebeck, 4:16 p.m.\n\nNorthern Dutchess County, in contrast, was a hive of activity at the end of the day, with a constant stream of voters coming in before polls closed at 5 p.m.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there's been steady traffic through [and] pretty good turnouts,\u201d said Jacob Palmer, who works for the county\u2019s board of elections and spent his day going between its five polling sites. \u201cIt's a little bit higher than we thought it was. We won't have an idea of the numbers until later on, but right but it's definitely around where we thought it would be and maybe a little bit higher than that. When we first opened all the places, it seemed like there was a lot of people waiting outside, which was pretty exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has made our life easier because we're both retired and we travel a lot,\u201d said voter Barb Maple, who came to the polls with Bill Maple. \u201cWe were going to be away for the election. So it saved us a trip down to the board of elections in Poughkeepsie to cast a ballot. I think anything that makes it easier for people to vote is critical. I really do. And they sound like they have a good turnout \u2026\n\n\u201cIt was very easy,\u201d she said of her experience casting an early ballot.\n\n\u201cVery easy, very straightforward,\u201d added Bill. \u201cThe personnel were very friendly and helpful. And it\u2019s a super idea.\u201d", "description": "Polls are open at a select number of locations in each county until Sunday, Nov. 3.", "authors": ["Bill Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/de/8b/071a35804d4dac3247f4da49ff68/ive-voted-stickers.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
