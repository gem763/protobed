Solskjaer pinning his hopes on Martial\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nSolskjaer couldn't make it more plain after Martial scored on his return to the starting lineup in Belgrade that he sees the Frenchman as his No.9.\n\nHe even took a little pop at predecessors Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal for playing him out wide.\n\n\u201cAnthony got put out on the wing by other managers and I understand why because he is so quick. But, for me, he is a proper No.9. He needs to be connected to the game.\"\n\nDuly, despite a draw with Liverpool and the win against Partizan, Solskjaer changed formation to bring Martial into his attack, returning to the 4-2-3-1 formation with which he started the season.\n\nAnd Martial certainly did his bit to help inspire United's attack. Yes, he missed a penalty but his overall display was good, linking those around him and he did get his goal, with a classy dinked finish.\n\n2. More penalty problems\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nRashford (2), Martial and Paul Pogba have all missed from the penalty spot now this season for Solskjaer's men, who have missed four of six from the spot.\n\nIt didn't cost them here, but they need to really nail it down because it turned a win at Wolves into a draw and a draw with Palace into a defeat.\n\n3. Aarons impresses\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nWhile Norwich may be falling somewhat short, finding themselves in the relegation zone, young England under-21 full-back Max Aarons is really stepping up to the plate.\n\nDefensively he still has to learn a fair bit - he can be naive with his positioning, as shown on Rashford's goal - but going forwards he's a real threat from deep.\n\nAt the beginning of both halves he created two standout chances, both time driving down the right and smartly pulling the ball back for a teammate; unfortunately the finishes couldn't match his approach play.\n\nCertainly Ashley Young will be happy to be away from him; the United skipper was booked for a crude challenge on the youngster, having been skinned a couple of times by Aarons.\n\n4. McTominay and James stepping up\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIf it is to be a youth revolution at Old Trafford under Solskjaer, then McTominay and James are both showing themselves to be the examples to follow, and again they showed here why the Norwegian trusts them.\n\nThe Scotland international was excellent for the most part here, commanding at the heart of midfield, using the ball well, initiating attacks and also protecting his defence. He wouldn't have been a regular under Ferguson - think more Wes Brown and John O'Shea - but this isn't that United and you can't knock him for that.\n\nJames is adapting to life on the right wing, where he offers a direct threat with his speed. That won United a penalty and launched a number of counters, with Jamal Lewis struggling to deal with him.\n\nBut he also produced a number of real quality deliveries and passes - most notably for Rashford's strike. The Welshman continues to grow and add more depth to his all-round game.\n\n5. 2000 just done it\n\nMcTominay's opener meant the Scot carved out his own slice of history at Carrow Road.\n\nHis strike was United's 2000th in the Premier League.\n\nIt also meant United are the first team to score 2000 Premier League goals.\n\nMcTominay joins illustrious company in reaching his milestone; Dimitar Berbatov notched number 1500, Crisiano Ronaldo the 1000th, Andy Cole number 500 and Andrei Kanchelskis the 100th.", "description": "Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial all scored - despite the latter pair both missing penalties", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Joe Toth Bpi Rex", "Getty Images", "Empics Sport", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737510.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ENG-PR-NORWICH-MAN-UTD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
