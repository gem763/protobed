Coming in the midst of the #MeToo movement and backed by her brother, reporter Ronan Farrow, Dylan\u2019s story caused some Hollywood stars to apologize for having worked with Allen over the years. But in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Wednesday, actress Scarlett Johansson stuck up for Allen:\n\n\u201cHow do I feel about Woody Allen?\u201d Johansson lets the question hang for a moment. Ever since the #MeToo movement caused Dylan Farrow\u2019s sexual abuse allegations against her father to be re-examined, much of Hollywood has distanced itself from Allen. The filmmaker long has denied the claims, but many actors who have worked with him, including Michael Caine, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Greta Gerwig, have publicly expressed regret about doing so, and Allen has been unable to find a U.S. distributor for his movies since Amazon canceled his deal in 2018. Allen directed Johansson in Match Point (2005), Scoop (2006) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) and played a key role in shaping her career as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after leading ladies. After a beat, Johansson makes it clear that she disagrees with many of her peers. \u201cI love Woody,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe him, and I would work with him anytime.\u201d Johansson continues: \u201cI see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it. I have been very direct with him, and he\u2019s very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him.\u201d Asked if this position feels fraught to express in a cultural environment where there is a new and powerful emphasis on believing women\u2019s allegations, Johansson says, \u201cIt\u2019s hard because it\u2019s a time where people are very fired up, and understandably. Things needed to be stirred up, and so people have a lot of passion and a lot of strong feelings and are angry, and rightfully so. It\u2019s an intense time.\u201d\n\nThe story notes that Johansson is one of the early members of Time\u2019s Up, a Hollywood movement focused on sexual harassment. She was also a speaker at the Women\u2019s March and has been a public supporter of Planned Parenthood. In other words, she\u2019s definitely not a conservative. That said, this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s cut against the Hollywood grain in a way that few actresses are willing to do.\n\nLast July, Johansson dropped out of a film in which she was set to play a transgender man after a backlash from a group of transgender activists and actors. She said after dropping out of the film, \u201cYou know, as an actor I should be allowed to play any person, or any tree, or any animal because that is my job and the requirements of my job.\u201d She added, \u201cI think society would be more connected if we just allowed others to have their own feelings and not expect everyone to feel the way we do.\u201d That\u2019s pretty brave as far as Hollywood goes these days.\n\nDylan Farrow responded to Johansson\u2019s comments via Twitter Wednesday evening:\n\nBecause if we\u2019ve learned anything from the past two years it\u2019s that you definitely should believe male predators who \u201cmaintain their innocence\u201d without question. Scarlett has a long way to go in understanding the issue she claims to champion. https://t.co/S1NmttL9tJ \u2014 Dylan Farrow (@RealDylanFarrow) September 5, 2019\n\nWhether or not Woody Allen is a \u201cmale predator\u201d is not as clear cut as Farrow and her brother Ronan would like the world to think. Last year, after Dylan\u2019s interview on CBS, Moses Farrow wrote a lengthy blog post saying he was there the day and doesn\u2019t recall any odd behavior. Moses claims his sister\u2019s story of the alleged molestation just doesn\u2019t add up.", "description": "\"I have had a lot of conversations with him about it.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Scarlett-Johansson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
