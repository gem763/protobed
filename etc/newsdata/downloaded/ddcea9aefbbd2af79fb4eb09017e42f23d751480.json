But now scientists fear the climate crisis may be disrupting the ability of corals to synchronise this marine phenomenon, threatening them with extinction.\n\nA Tel Aviv university study, published in Science, has found the release of eggs and sperm in certain reef-building corals in the Gulf of Eilat in the Red Sea have changed over time and have lost their synchronicity. For a coral, reliant on a chance encounter, timing is everything. But researchers have found some are spawning \u201cout of tune\u201d with normal patterns, with the result that fewer baby corals are forming.\n\n\u201cCoral spawning \u2026 is one of the greatest examples of synchronised phenomena in nature,\u201d said Professor Yossi Loya, of the university\u2019s School of Zoology. \u201cOnce a year, thousands of corals along hundreds of kilometres of a coral reef release their eggs and sperm simultaneously into the open water, where fertilisation will later take place. Since both the eggs and the sperm of corals can persist only a few hours in the water, the timing of this event is critical.\u201d\n\nAlthough visually, the coral reefs seemed healthy, the corals suffering a breakdown in spawning synchrony produced fewer baby corals, creating circumstances for extinction. While it is not yet fully understood exactly how spawning synchrony works, scientists say it relies on environmental cues, including sea temperature, solar irradiance, wind, the phase of the moon and the time of sunset.\n\nThe researchers began monitoring corals in the Gulf of Eilat in 2015 and, over four years, recorded the number of spawning individuals during the annual coral reproductive season, between June and September. They compared spawning timings of five coral species between 2015 and 2018 to results from two other studies conducted on the same species in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWe found that, in some of the most abundant coral species, the spawning synchrony had become erratic, contrasting both the widely accepted paradigm of highly synchronous coral spawning and studies performed on the exact same reefs decades ago,\u201d said Tom Shlesinger, a PhD student and co-author of the study.\n\n'They eat everything in their path': Spain's shellfish farmers turn on starfish | Stephen Burgen Read more\n\nTo find out whether this failure in spawning synchrony translated into reproductive failure, they mapped thousands of corals within permanent reef plots, revisiting the plots every year to see how many corals of a given species had died, compared to new juveniles.\n\n\u201cAlthough it appeared that the overall state of the coral reefs at Eilat was quite good and every year we found many new corals recruiting to the reefs, for those species that are suffering from the breakdown in spawning synchrony, there was a clear lack of recruitment of new juvenile generations, meaning that some species that currently appear to be abundant may actually be nearing extinction through reproductive failure,\u201d said Shlesinger.\n\nIt is not yet known what was causing the loss of synchrony. However, the researchers found temperature had a \u201cstrong influence\u201d on coral reproductive cycles. In the study region, temperatures are rising \u201cfast\u201d, at rate of 0.31C a decade. Another plausible cause could be endocrine or hormonal disrupting pollutants, accumulating in marine environments, they said. The study was based on five corals; however, the researchers believe their findings could be a warning to other species.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the exact cause leading to these declines in spawning synchrony, our findings serve as a timely wake-up call to start considering these subtler challenges to coral survival, which are very likely also impacting additional species in other regions,\u201d said Shlesinger. \u201cOn a positive note, identifying early warning signs of such reproductive mismatches will contribute to directing our future research and conservation efforts toward the very species that are at potential risk of decline, long before they even display any visible signs of stress or mortality.\u201d", "description": "Study finds breakdown in annual spawning synchrony in Red Sea, threatening some species with extinction", "authors": ["Karen Mcveigh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c13f3f283015e97fdff5dc6877a9506d4f48968c/0_24_1612_967/master/1612.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26b6577fb09d24a8c3062076656164d6", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
