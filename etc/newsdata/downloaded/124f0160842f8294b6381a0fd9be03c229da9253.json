Yet in her hands was her latest victim: a chubby sea cucumber the color of burnt umber. Bright cleaved the slippery echinoderm down the middle, then removed several white slivers of meat and cooked them over a fire she\u2019d built. It was time for breakfast. All around her, on the rocky gray beach, 19 of Bright\u2019s classmates were performing similar drills. In total, the Coast Guard had dropped 103 Schoenbar Middle School students\u2014the majority of Ketchikan, Alaska\u2019s eighth graders\u2014on six nearby uninhabited islands to survive for two days and nights last May. I\u2019d accompanied Bright\u2019s group to Back Island, where, like the rest of their classmates, students had each brought nothing more than a 10-by-15-foot sheet of plastic, a sleeping bag, clothing, and whatever additional supplies (rice, knives, foil, twine, matches) they could fit into a 12-ounce metal coffee can.\n\n\u201cThe survival trip,\u201d as it\u2019s known in this isolated island community, has occurred annually for 45 years. It serves not only as the students\u2019 final science exam but also, more importantly, as preparation for growing up in the unforgiving wilderness they call home. Sitting at a square table in Schoenbar\u2019s library last year, Stephen Kinney, the mind behind the trip, told me that he had no idea it would become such a long-standing tradition. The amiable retired educator said his main goal had simply been for students to enjoy school (because growing up, he never had). \u201cLearning should be fun,\u201d Kinney, 77, explained. (He and everyone else in this story are identified with their age as of last year\u2019s survival trip.) \u201cThere needs to be some kind of a hook. [Students] need to be involved in their education.\u201d He recalled the time he found a dead sea lion and brought it to his science class for dissection; decades later, students still mention it when they see him around town. \u201cThat\u2019s a really critical piece of education: to catch students\u2019 imagination, to grab them,\u201d he said. Kinney, who grew up in Maine, moved to Ketchikan in 1965 to teach eighth-grade science at the brand-new Schoenbar Middle School. The lifelong outdoorsman was surprised by how many of his students didn\u2019t know basic survival skills, such as how to build a shelter or start a fire. So in 1973, along with a fellow teacher, Don Knapp, he brought a group of eighth graders to Settlers Cove, a state recreation area 18 miles north of Ketchikan. \u201cOur goal was to have them live off the land,\u201d Kinney said. \u201cTo realize that the land provides if you understand it.\u201d\n\nThat was the Ketchikan students\u2019 very first survival trip. In the years that followed, more students and teachers joined. When Kinney and Lyle Huntley, another eighth-grade teacher who\u2019d become the trip\u2019s co-organizer, both transferred to the seventh grade, they brought the concept with them. They launched an annual two-night camping trip that taught basic outdoor education in preparation for the big eighth-grade trip the following year. Today, both grades spend the last six to eight weeks of the school year on a Southeast Alaskan science unit\u2014environmental science in seventh grade, and safety and survival in eighth grade\u2014that culminates with each grade\u2019s much-anticipated overnight adventure. (While students aren\u2019t required to go on the trips, the majority do. The school does not allow students who have significant behavioral issues or who are failing three or more classes to attend.) Other teachers integrate the themes into their curriculum at the end of the school year, too: For their final English project, for example, the eighth graders must choose a book set in Alaska. \u201cIt\u2019s so Ketchikan,\u201d Kinney says. \u201cI mean, Ketchikan is living outdoors, is hiking, is fishing, is boating, is being out there. And so learning to do it safely makes a lot of logical sense, but also was a lot of fun.\u201d On a crisp sunny day last spring, the U.S. Coast Guard ferried Ketchikan\u2019s eighth graders to their respective islands. Each group consisted of approximately 20 students (separated by gender), one teacher leader, and three or four parent chaperones. (For safety, the adults had access to cellphones and radios\u2014the kids did not.)\n\nOn Back Island, the leader was 29-year-old Jamie Karlson, a sprightly music teacher with a pixie cut and a quick laugh. Right away, she directed the students to find shelter. In groups of four, they headed to the woods and employed techniques they\u2019d learned in class: draping plastic sheets over twine strung between evergreens, and wrapping rocks along the edges to weight them down. Shelter secured, they played cards, gossiped, and hid from one another during a round of sardines, exhilarated with the freedom of being outdoors on a school day. Later in the afternoon, Karlson blew her whistle three times, signaling the students to assemble on the beach. \u201cYou have 10 minutes to collect tinder, kindling, and fuel, and then it\u2019s time to gather food,\u201d she said. Karlson wanted the students to begin searching for food several hours before that evening\u2019s 8:08 p.m. low tide, explaining that \u201cit\u2019s best to forage things as they're getting uncovered.\u201d Since Southeast Alaska has some of the biggest tides in the world, changing as much as 25 feet in six hours, each year\u2019s survival trip is timed around lower-than-average \u201cminus tides,\u201d which provide the best opportunities for foraging. The girls scattered, gathering wood and old-man\u2019s beard, a pale-green lichen that makes a good fire starter. One of the chaperones, Tony Yeisley, approached his daughter Savannah. In his hands was an unruly clump of dried moss, cedar, and seagrass. \u201cThat\u2019s going to light up like a Roman candle,\u201d he told his daughter with a grin. An easygoing plumber who plays the electric guitar, Yeisley had already been on four survival trips: his own, 34 years prior, and three of his four older children\u2019s. This trip, with his youngest, could be his last.\n\nWhen it came time to forage, the students seemed unsure how to begin. They cautiously fanned toward the tideline, scanning for anything that looked edible. Gabriella Mas decided to look for limpets, tiny marine snails that cling to intertidal rocks. But about 15 seconds into her hunt, she shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s none!\u201d Karlson called out, \u201cThey\u2019re tricky; look closer to the water.\u201d A few moments later, Mas exclaimed to her partner, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s so many here. There\u2019s like a million\u2014use your knife!\u201d Limpets, easy to spot and pry from their perches, turned out to be the protein of choice for many students\u2019 first meal. Most of the girls boiled them with rice and bouillon cubes from their coffee cans, along with a variety of sea lettuces salvaged from the shore. (One lettuce called \u201csugar rack\u201d was unanimously declared to sound better than it tasted.) On the horizon, seals peeked out of the water, and a humpback whale swam by with her calf. Enormous bald eagles skirred overhead. The girls relaxed quietly around the fire, or in their shelters, before tucking into their sleeping bags at 10 p.m., just as the last rays of light faded from the sky. The first Alaskan city along the famed Inside Passage, Ketchikan is known for several things: commercial fishing (77 million pounds of salmon, halibut, and other seafood passed through its docks in 2017, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service), rich Native American culture (it\u2019s home to the biggest collection of totem poles in the state), and cruise ships (more than 1 million passengers visit each summer).\n\nIt\u2019s also famous for its \u201cliquid sunshine.\u201d Located in the 16.8 million acre Tongass National Forest, the largest remaining temperate rain forest in the world, the region\u2019s lush mountains and streams are fed by an average of 152 inches of rain each year. (By comparison, neighboring Seattle averages 37 inches.) Strong winds are common too; in 2018, a winter storm clocked gusts of 112 mph. While the land area of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough (Alaska\u2019s administrative equivalent of a county) is larger than Connecticut, it has just 13,754 residents. When considering both land and water, a mere 0.1 percent of the borough is inhabited, according to Jonathan Lappin, an associate planner for the borough. Read: Travel Monday: A photo trip to Southeast Alaska This combination of extreme weather and extreme remoteness is why many view survival education as a vital part of Ketchikan\u2019s curriculum. Sam Pflaum, a 29-year-old electrical worker and commercial fisherman, told me that the eighth-grade trip was \u201cthe most useful thing\u201d he did in school, saying: \u201cIt probably has saved my life.\u201d He cited the night of December 27, 2012, as an example. While he was on his way home to Ketchikan, the pull cord snapped off his boat\u2019s engine. It was nearly dark, so Pflaum and his companion decided to spend the night on the beach. In the 15 minutes of daylight that remained, buffeted by wind, rain, and snow, they managed to light a fire and set up a shelter\u2014skills Pflaum had learned a decade prior. Despite experiencing 50-mile-per-hour gusts, a foot of snow, and hypothermia, they made it through the night.\n\nTo Pflaum, the survival trip is an indispensable part of growing up in Ketchikan. The skills acquired, he explained, are \u201cnot something that just grows dust in the back of your brain\u201d; they\u2019re something many residents use. \u201c[In] a lot of places, the wilderness is somewhat canned\u2014it\u2019s in a park or whatever\u2014but up here this place is still pretty wild,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful place on Earth, but it will kill you.\u201d The sun rose at 4:30 a.m. on the survival trip\u2019s second day. At 7:30 a.m., Karlson roused the students; low tide was a little more than an hour away, and they needed to scavenge their breakfast. Hungrier and more confident than they\u2019d been the day before, the girls were ready to expand their boundaries beyond limpets. The husky sea cucumbers were tempting, but the young survivalists had no idea how to turn them into food. The chaperone Brett Summers took charge. Summers, a lifelong Ketchikan resident who was there with his daughter Piper, wore Dickies jeans under his Xtratufs and a baseball cap over his black ponytail. As several students gathered around, he pulled a knife from his belt loop and cut a six-inch cucumber open. A gush of seawater poured out, revealing its spindly guts. The girls peppered Summers with questions and concerns: \u201cUgh, why is that happening?\u201d \u201cIs that his butthole?\u201d \u201cIt looks like spaghetti!\u201d \u201cDoes that hurt?\u201d His response: \u201cEat it\u2014it won\u2019t kill you.\u201d\n\nHunger, indeed, soon vanquished squeamishness. Pairs of girls ventured off to different parts of the island; within 10 minutes, they pranced back to camp with their prey draped across their arms.\n\nKarlson, who jokingly referred to the cucumbers as her \u201cbreakfast bacon,\u201d fluttered between groups, answering questions and observing dynamics. She would, eventually, have to grade each student in 10 categories, including fire building, shelter arrangement, staying dry, cooking food, common sense, and attitude. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to see them out here in a totally different environment,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey have to work together in ways they probably never would in a classroom.\u201d All told, the morning\u2019s haul was impressive: In addition to limpets and sea cucumbers, the girls tracked down gumboots, rock scallops, urchins, red rock crab, and tiny shrimp. They had also grown more adventurous with their recipes; one group even created seaweed \u201cwraps\u201d filled with rice and sea cucumber. One student, Makena Johansen, admitted that foraging was easier than she thought it would be, and that the sea cucumbers tasted better than she\u2019d imagined. \u201cYeah,\u201d added Wileena Baghoomian, another student; \u201cAt first they were gross, but now they\u2019re kinda good.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the day was spent on a fire-building contest, a hand-built stretcher race, a talent show, and, of course, more foraging. Despite their growling stomachs, the students\u2019 morale remained high. Many conversations centered around food\u2014one student, Julia Spigai, said she\u2019d never again forgo a box of leftovers at a restaurant\u2014but they didn\u2019t complain much. They seemed to understand that the discomfort was part of the 45-year-old rite of passage their friends, siblings, and parents had all completed. \u201cThey\u2019re preparing you for living in Alaska so you know you\u2019re not gonna die,\u201d Savannah Yeisley said matter-of-factly. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t think they could get stranded, but it happens.\u201d Around the campfire that night, the chaperones actually lamented the unusual abundance of sun; they worried the good weather was making the trip less challenging for the kids. \u201cIt\u2019s not as much of a survival trip in this weather,\u201d said Todd Bright, a stay-at-home dad who had been on two prior trips (his own, in 1987, and his older son\u2019s). \u201cOut here you\u2019re not going to starve\u2014it\u2019s the rain and cold you\u2019ve got to worry about.\u201d Read: When wilderness boot camps take tough love too far That tough Alaskan attitude permeates the culture of the survival trip, and is shared by students, parents, and even those responsible for orchestrating the event. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but think of all the things that could go wrong\u2014but they haven\u2019t,\u201d says Sherilynn Boehlert, the principal of Schoenbar Middle School. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be hungry, and they\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d", "description": "For 45 years, eighth graders in Ketchikan, Alaska, have gone on an overnight survival trip to a remote island.", "authors": ["Susan Shain"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/survival_school_1/facebook.jpg?1559672852"}
