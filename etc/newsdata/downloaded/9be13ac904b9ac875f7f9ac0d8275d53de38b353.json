I'm just speechless. I'm just so proud of myself.\n\n\"I couldn't have asked more of myself than to do that.\n\n\"If I can run that sort of time off the amount of training I've done, if I'm 100 per cent fit I'm going to be so confident going into next year.\"\n\nEarlier, Shara Proctor and Abigail Irozuru qualified for Sunday's long jump final, but Jazmin Sawyers missed out.\n\nProctor said: \"The runway feels amazing. Regardless of the crowd, lack of numbers, the atmosphere is electric.\n\n\"I enjoyed being out there. I really had to contain myself as I knew I had a job out there.\n\n\"It's the first part of the job done, I had one job and that was to come here today and make the final.\"\n\nCindy Ofili came through the 100m hurdles heats, finishing third in 12.97s.\n\nShe said: \"Things have started clicking for me towards the end of this season and I am so ready.\n\n\"I haven't competed in three years at a championship so this is a dust-buster and the jitters are out now.\"\n\nIn the women's 4x400m relay heats Zoey Clark, Jodie Williams, Jessica Turner and Laviai Nielsen reached Sunday's final in 3:24.99.\n\nBut the men's team of Cameron Chambers, Rabah Yousif, Martyn Rooney and Lee Thompson failed to qualify.", "description": "Laura Muir suffered more World Championship heartbreak as she missed out on a medal despite a hugely gutsy run in a remarkable 1500 metres final.
