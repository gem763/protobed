From its role in lowering the levels of trust in media, to inciting online violence, and amplifying political disinformation in elections\u2014 Facebook isn\u2019t just a space to share \u201cwhat\u2019s on your mind,\u201d and you\u2019d be naive to believe so.\n\nWith just over a year left until the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, Facebook updated its policies on the spread of misinformation and released a bunch of new tools to better \u201cprotect the democratic process\u201d in a post published yesterday. Now, Facebook will clearly label false posts and state-controlled media, and will invest $2 million in media literacy projects to help people understand the information they\u2019re seeing online.\n\nOver the next month, content published on Facebook and Instagram that has been rated false or partly false by a third-party fact-checker will be more prominently labeled so people can better decide for themselves what to read, trust, and share. A pop-up will also appear when users attempt to share posts on Instagram that include content that\u2019s been debunked by its fact-checkers.\n\nScreenshots of the fact-checking features to be rolled out over the next month.

Despite there being more social media platforms than ever, Facebook remains the most popular choice for online manipulation with propaganda campaigns found on the platform in 56 countries.\n\nTo fight this, Facebook revealed it has removed four networks found to be fake, state-backed misinformation-spreading accounts based in Iran and Russia \u2014 countries that have recently been found to cross borders to spread misinformation on not just their in-apps but on a global scale too.\n\nAlongside these updates to protect voters in the states, the tech giant introduced a security tool for elected officials and candidates that monitors their accounts to detect hacking such as login attempts in unusual locations or on unverified devices.\n\nAlthough Facebook is increasing its transparency on the content it hosts, questions still linger as to why the platform allows such ads to circulate online in the first place. Earlier this year, during the Australian election, Facebook said it\u2019s not \u201cour role to remove content that one side of a political debate considers to be false,\u201d adding it only removes content that violates their community standards.\n\nAs the face of election campaigns change as technology advances, social platforms like Facebook must take responsibility in preventing the spread of misinformation. But there\u2019s no denying that Facebook\u2019s latest steps to curb this issue are promising.\n\nRead next: 5 reasons why Amsterdam is great for blockchain tech development", "description": "Facebook updated its policies on the spread of misinformation and released a bunch of new tools to better \u201cprotect the democratic process.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fpic-2.png&signature=80295fae640f9124388dfff6c4c03991", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
