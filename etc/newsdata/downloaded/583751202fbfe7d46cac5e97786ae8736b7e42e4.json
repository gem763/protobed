Now it\u2019s time for the EU to do the same,\u201d Barclay said.\n\nBut Barnier struck a downbeat tone Wednesday, telling the European Parliament that \u201cwe\u2019re not on the point of envisioning and finding a deal\u201d.\n\nJohnson and Varadkar are expected to focus their discussions on the contentious Northern Irish border, which has proved the key sticking point in the three years of tortuous Brexit negotiations.\n\nJohnson claims his proposals provide a new way to avoid a hard border between British province Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit.\n\nIt would take the province out of the EU\u2019s customs union but keep it largely aligned with the bloc\u2019s \u201csingle market\u201d standards and regulations.\n\nThe British leader\u2019s plans would also see Northern Irish politicians given a vote every four years on maintaining the agreed arrangements.\n\nBrussels is adamant it will not agree to any plan that undermines the single market or leaves Ireland exposed, and that hands hardline unionists in the north a veto.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will on Thursday meet his Irish counterpart for last-ditch Brexit talks, with just days left to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/39e692_leo-varadkar-boris-johnson-month-in-dublin-meet-as-time-runs-out-sign-off-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
