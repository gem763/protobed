Here\u2019s how you can do it too", "language": "en", "text": "Here\u2019s how an over-indebted young woman turned her finances around in just six months.\n\nWhen 26-year-old Samke started on her Money Makeover journey her goal was to be debt-free by the age of 30. Once an energetic and happy woman with a strong sense of helping others, Samke admitted that her financial burden had sucked the life out of her.\n\n\u201cI was on anti-depressants and had stopped looking after my body. I had even stopped doing the things I enjoy, like reading.\u201d\n\nIt seemed like an ambitious target as Samke was already swamped in debt, living off her credit card, juggling living expenses and family demands by taking on expensive, short-term loans.\n\nYet just a few months after celebrating her 27th birthday Samke had achieved her goal and was living the life of financial freedom. This is the story of her six-month Absa/City Press Money Makeover Challenge.\n\n\u201cThe financial pressure came when I started working. My first job used to pay me R3500 and transport was R800, I used to give my parents R1000 and I had to take care of my needs as well.\n\n\u201cNot having any financial education or awareness made me vulnerable to all the offers I would get from financial institutions. No one offered to teach me about different investments or savings plans, but I was always offered loans. In a way it made me think that I could afford the \u2018new\u2019 lifestyle I was living as I had been a student and money to me was a dream.\n\n\u201cInstead of that habit stopping when I got a new job with more money, it just escalated, and I was offered more loans. One day I just found myself deep in debt, not being able to pay and not coping. It just felt like I never had enough money.\n\n\u201cThings got worse when I got retrenched. I was in and out of jobs that offered me half of what I used to earn. Now the lifestyle I was used too become too much... since I work in finance it hindered me from getting jobs because no one wants to hire a finance person who has a bad credit record.\n\n\u201cI also had family obligations since I come from a disadvantaged background, I needed to take care of things and make sure that the family has enough to through the month.\u201d\n\nWhen Samke entered the Absa/City Press Money Makeover Challenge she had just started a new job with a better salary and wanted to use this opportunity to start making better financial decisions. She worked with Absa financial adviser Steve Williamson, who helped her draw up a proper budget and form a repayment plan. By sticking to her new budget Samke found an extra R1000 a month that she could use to target those debts. With the support of Steve and the motivation to stay on money bootcamp, Samke experienced both a financial and emotional transition.\n\nWithin the six months she settled her short-term debt and built up an emergency fund. Her goal of being debt-free by 30 was fast-tracked to being debt-free by 27. Samke also experienced a significant personal shift.\n\n\u201cI am no longer depressed, and I am much happier and more open. Towards the end of the six months my partner said, \u2018there is something different about you, you are so alive and happy\u2019 and every day that is how I feel. I now go to the gym and I have changed my look completely.\u201d\n\nSamke also laid down boundaries for her family commitments. She set an amount in her budget to support her family and learnt to say \u2018no\u2019 to additional financial requests. She also had to review the amount she was giving to her church. As someone who believes in giving, she had to realise that the only sustainable way to give is to make sure your own finances are stable. You cannot give to charity using your credit card. Due to her more robust budget she was able to manage a financial setback when her mother needed to be hospitalised without tapping into credit or her savings.\n\nDuring her financial journey she calculated exactly how much a car would cost her each month and realised that she was not yet ready to buy a new car. She is now actively saving towards a deposit to reduce the monthly instalments.\n\nIf Samke\u2019s story resonates with you and you are ready to commit and take the challenge, the Absa/City Press Money Makeover Challenge is once again open for applications.
