While the old policy allowed the district to enforce this rule, officials told the newspaper that it was never enforced.\n\nCherry Hill East, a high school in the Cherry Hill, New Jersey school district, is pictured above.

Elementary students can also face repercussions for a large lunch debt, and may not be allowed to participate in after-school events or go on class trips.\n\nRead more: Students will reportedly face 'severe consequences' for a racist promposal sign\n\nOne resident in the room said the policy unfairly penalizes children for their parents' responsibilities.\n\n\"It is an elitist assumption on the part of this school board that parents are not paying this bill because they don't want to,\" resident Vibiana Cvetkovic said, according to the Courier Post.\n\nAccording to the Courier Post, Elizabeth Idler said that if parents are \"flat out refusing\" to pay the bill, \"why will stopping the children from going to activities entice them to pay further?\"\n\nAnd student board member Jacob Graff expressed concern that missing out on extracurricular activities would impact students' chances of getting into college.\n\nBoard president Eric Goodwin brushed away concerns, saying the policy was designed to help the district identify which students are in need. It was also pointed out that principals will have discretion on whether to enforce the rule.", "description": "The Cherry Hill, New Jersey school board passed a new policy Tuesday night which could allow schools to ban students from prom over lunch debt.", "authors": ["Ashley Collman"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da77022e94e866a01370d88?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
