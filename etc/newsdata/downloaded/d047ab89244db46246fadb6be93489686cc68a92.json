You only start paying once the development is complete, therefore getting capital appreciation on the property while it is being built.\n\nAnother advantage \u2013 from a buy-to-let perspective \u2013 is that many tenants like to rent brand-new properties that have never been lived in before, which means owners may be able to charge a slightly higher rental.\n\nHowever, before you dive in, Kohler also suggests a few key questions to ask.\n\n1. How many years have you been in business?\n\nEnsure the developer has a good track record, says Kohler.\n\n2. How many developments have you completed?\n\nIs the list long or short? Also compare the length of time they have been in business to the number of successfully completed projects.\n\n3. Could I have a list of your completed developments?\n\nLook at previous completed developments and make sure they were built well, on time, and actually look like the architectural drawings promised in the brochures, Kohler suggests.\n\n4. In your previous developments, does transfer and occupation generally occur at the same time?\n\nFind out if you should anticipate any long lag times, or if there is any fine print you should be aware of regarding the practicalities.\n\n5. Are your renderings a true reflection of what the development is going to look like?\n\nLooking at their previous work should also give you an indication of how reliable their delivery is.\n\n6. Who is the managing agent who prepared the budget and levies for this development?\n\nLook at the track record of who they are working with, and see if you can find reliable feedback or testimonials from past customers.\n\n7. Do your levies include provision for maintenance, or are there generally special levies imposed for major maintenance?\n\nEnsure you are aware of any potential hidden costs coming up ahead \u2013 you don't want any nasty shocks to your budget.", "description": "Buying property off-plan means you will depend on the developer and builder to complete your home properly, within your requirements and on time, explains a property expert.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4353/8d9612f9f125477394d191859346d735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
