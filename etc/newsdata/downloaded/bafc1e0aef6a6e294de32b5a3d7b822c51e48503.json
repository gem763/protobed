That's why we test.\"\n\nSome of the technical challenges SpaceX is working on include concerns about the parachutes and the propulsion system.\n\n\"It's a pretty arduous engineering job to get the parachutes right,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Parachutes, they look easy but they are definitely not easy,\" he added. \"We want to get at least something on the order of 10 successful tests in a row before launching astronauts.\"\n\nSince retiring its space shuttle program, NASA has had to rely on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station at a cost of $85m a seat. It is now counting on SpaceX and Boeing to carry out that task.\n\nSpaceX was founded in 2002 by Musk to help reduce space transportation costs - and with an ultimate goal of helping colonise Mars.\n\nThe first manned flight to the space station was due to take place last year but SpaceX suffered a major setback in April when its Crew Dragon spacecraft exploded during testing, prompting delays and renewed tests.\n\n\"You know, honestly, if there's a test program and nothing happens in that test programme, I would say that test program is insufficiently rigorous,\" Musk said on Thursday.\n\n\"Space is hard,\" he added.", "description": "SpaceX could launch US astronauts to the International Space Station as early as next year if tests on the company's long-delayed Crew Dragon capsule prove conclusive, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9337/3d922ae037c14530a4e334d14e4a5b75.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
