All were decked out in red.\n\nFederer, who failed to win a Grand Slam this year, said their backing had been key to his revival.\n\n\"It's definitely very special here because they all sit in one block, sort of like in football to some extent, which is highly unusual for tennis and a tennis tournament,\" he said.\n\nFederer, fondly nicknamed \"cow\" in China, will play an exhibition tournament at the end of the year in the nearby city of Hangzhou.\n\n\"Hangzhou was just something I thought would be this year good preparation for the Australian Open and also something that would be very exciting for me to go and play,\" he said.\n\n- Perfect Djokovic -\n\nStory continues\n\nWorld number one Novak Djokovic made light work of American John Isner and plays promising 21-year-old Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece in the last eight.\n\nThe defending champion from Serbia dismissed the 16th seed Isner 7-5, 6-3 in 74 minutes after taming Isner's booming serve.\n\n\"It's always a big challenge returning the serve of Isner,\" said Djokovic, who is over the shoulder problem that curtailed his US Open defence.\n\n\"He's got one of the biggest serves of all time, he's one of the tallest guys ever to play tennis.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old Djokovic is looking imperious, having not dropped a set in claiming the title in Tokyo last week and continuing that perfect record in Shanghai.\n\nAlso in the last eight on Friday, colourful Italian Fabio Fognini faces red-hot Russian Daniil Medvedev.\n\nThe fourth-ranked Medvedev was forced to sweat -- and not just because of the Shanghai heat -- after being 5-2 down in the first set to Canadian qualifier Vasek Pospisil.\n\nThe 23-year-old Medvedev eventually squeezed through 7-6 (9/7), 7-5.\n\n\"I was down five set points and 5-2 also,\" said the US Open finalist, fast making a big name for himself as the man most likely to challenge Federer, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.\n\n\"Usually the set is finished when it's like this, so just try to win every point I had to face, and finally it worked out.\"\n\nMedvedev, who has been in eight finals this year, winning three of them, smashed his racquet as the frustration built and he threatened to boil over in the Shanghai sun.\n\n\"I usually don't like to break racquets because it's never beautiful,\" he said.\n\nThe Spaniard Nadal is not in Shanghai because of a wrist injury.", "description": "Roger Federer said that his devoted band of Chinese supporters helped pull him through a tough first set and into the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals on Thursday.
