The lessons from this anniversary will end mass shootings.\n\nSix years ago, on Sept. 16, 2013, the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard was under attack. On that Monday, more than 3,000 Navy Yard employees would report as normal to work with a desire to make the Navy stronger, and in turn make America safer. Yet, on that day there would be a shooter in the building that threatened the lives of each of them.\n\nJennifer Bennett was one of them.\n\nAs she was evacuating the building down a stairwell, she walked into the shooter and was shot point blank with the sawed-off shotgun. That event caused time to slow down into a super slow motion that she calls her \u201cmatrix\u201d moment. When the shooter lowered his weapon, Jennifer says that she saw every move of the shooter \u2014 frame by frame, millisecond by millisecond.\n\nShe saw the \u201cshot\u201d leave the end of the barrel and head straight for her. As it flew threw the air, she watched it come closer, then strike her left shoulder. She next heard the familiar sound of a shotgun blast, as if to congratulate the shot for hitting its target.\n\nThe shooter left his post thinking he had another kill and went down the stairs. Jennifer was able to escape by going up and then out to the roof. After an hour and 10 minutes, Jennifer was dramatically rescued by helicopter and flown to safety. Within minutes she would be in surgery to repair the hole in her left shoulder. (Yes a hole, think Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny.)\n\nHer incredible recovery would last months, including subsequent surgeries and painful physical therapy.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with her and she believes her insights just might lead to the end of all mass shootings.\n\nQ: Jennifer, how are you doing?\n\nIt is well with my soul. I have pain every day, but the days are getting better. I am thankful for all who kept me alive. From those on the roof with me, to the helicopter team that rescued me, to the surgeons that put my shoulder back together. They are real heroes to me.\n\nQ: There\u2019s a lot of discussion about ending mass shootings, please comment?\n\nThe discussions today identifies the \u201cwhat\u201d that causes them. Many are talking about the gun, the size of the magazine, and background checks. Although mass shootings by definition require a gun, it is not the gun that commits them, it\u2019s today\u2019s culture that creates them. It\u2019s not the gun\u2019s fault, it never has been and never will be. It\u2019s the culture America has created that allow mass shootings.\n\nQ: What do you mean by today\u2019s culture?\n\nAmericans have always had access to firearms. In fact, without them, we never could have won our independence from England. However, when I was going to school in the 1960s, we still had guns, but we didn\u2019t have the culture of mass shootings that we have today.\n\nQ: You have mentioned \u201cculture\u201d a couple of times. What about our culture are you talking about?\n\nIf we want to end mass shootings, we must change the culture that facilitates mass shootings.\n\nQ: Can you be more specific?\n\nAmerican culture was founded on Christian principles that are literally enshrined in our founding documents. Today, our culture has eliminated any reference of Christianity. And in some cases, personal religious beliefs actually land the faithful afoul of the law. The last few decades have witnessed an increased hostility toward Christians. When government can punish an individual for not baking a cake, or selling flowers, or paying for abortion, then the culture has shifted away from religious freedom to something else.\n\nQ: What else?\n\nAmerican culture no longer values life. With abortion on-demand up until the moment of birth, our culture has shifted away from a culture of life to a culture of death. Politicians now openly discuss and pass legislation that remove life\u2019s value, starting from the beginning of life (conception) to after the child is born (infanticide), to the end (assisted suicide).\n\nEvery person today knows that their mother had a \u2018choice\u2019 to kill them or to let them live. Let\u2019s be honest. If a mom can kill her own baby, then it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that years later, that same baby could choose to go into a school, a movie theater or dance club and kill someone? A culture that allows the killing of innocent children facilitates the killing of innocent students, movie goers or dancers.\n\nQ: I can tell you have something else that is on your mind.\n\nYes, our culture no longer allows our children to fail, or to face the consequences of their actions. The way we grow up has an unshakable influence and impact on the way we live as adults. Today, if a child doesn\u2019t pass a class, then it\u2019s the teachers\u2019 fault. Everyone who tries out for the cheerleading squad makes it, and at the end of the season, everyone gets a trophy. But this isn\u2019t how the world works.\n\nSo, when that child grows into adulthood having never failed at anything, it\u2019s no wonder that life\u2019s ordinary challenges can turn into huge events that these adults are simply not prepared to handle. And when there is no God to answer to, and no value for innocent life, it is not too implausible to think this adult just might go out and buy a gun to punish the person(s) who made them fail.\n\nQ: As we approach the sixth anniversary of you being shot, what final thoughts do you have?\n\nIn short, there needs to be a shift from the discussion of the \u201cmechanics\u201d of gun violence to \u201cwhy\u201d we have a culture of mass shootings. When our culture values life once again, mass shootings will end. When our children grow up in a culture that rewards hard work, achievement and excellence, then mass shootings will end. And when our culture again embraces a higher authority, then mass shootings will end.\n\nJennifer Bennett is the only Navy Yard employee to be shot and survive. Her book, \u201cStanding Still in A Culture of Mass Shootings,\u201d explores in greater detail her beliefs about mass shootings and how to shift the culture back to a culture without them.
