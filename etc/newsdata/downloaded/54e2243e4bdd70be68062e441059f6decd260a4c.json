At least, that\u2019s what it wants you to think. The service, set to debut in the US on 12 November, has been billed as a one-stop-shop for all of the studio\u2019s existing content \u2013 from Marvel to Star Wars, National Geographic to Frozen. Add to that a whole host of new films and TV shows, boasting A-list stars and blockbuster-sized budgets. There\u2019s zero subtlety about this. Disney+ has no ambitions to start small and grow steadily in size. It\u2019s here to conquer. Yet there\u2019s been a lot of big talk for a service that still has much to prove, especially when it comes to challenging the current king of the streamers, Netflix, and its base of over 150 million subscribers worldwide (and growing). It\u2019ll also have to fend off the likes of Amazon Prime, alongside several yet-to-debut services from Disney\u2019s biggest competitors at the box office \u2013 Universal and Warner Bros.\n\nThe boldest of Disney+\u2019s strategies here is its pricing. Crucially, there\u2019s been no official announcement of when the service will become available in the UK, due to several existing agreements that allow Sky to air the studio\u2019s properties. In the US, however, subscriptions will cost just $6.99 (\u00a35.70) a month, with access to four simultaneous streams, alongside 4K and Ultra HD picture quality. Those are options you\u2019d normally only get by signing up to Netflix\u2019s premium plan, which costs $15.99 per month, while its basic package is still $12.99 per month \u2013 the exact same price as the Disney+ bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+, both owned by the studio.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a bit of aggressive marketing, though. Disney CEO Robert Iger has been very upfront about the fact that the Disney+ library will initially be much smaller than its competitors. In the first year of launch, the service will feature 500 films and 7,500 episodes of TV, in comparison to Netflix\u2019s estimated 4,000 films and 47,000 episodes (according to Ampere Analysis). That number will surely only grow and, for now, the studio can offer such cut-throat prices because it doesn\u2019t have to worry about expensive licensing deals. Netflix, meanwhile, is in a very different boat. Its library is about to take some major hits now that Disney, Universal, and Warner Bros are starting to pull their product in order to place it on their own streaming services.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWill Netflix have the same appeal when it\u2019s no longer the place to binge endless episodes of The Office and Friends? It\u2019s hard to tell. The service has been so reluctant to release any kind of viewing data that it\u2019s almost impossible to figure out how successful its original content is in comparison to what it licenses from other companies. A handful of shows have managed to enter the cultural mainstream, certainly, and even won a few awards along the way, including Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, and Making a Murderer. In more recent months, Netflix appears to have narrowed its focus and started snatching up more experienced talent, landing deals with Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss, Patty Jenkins, Scandal\u2019s Shonda Rhimes, and Ryan Murphy.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar approach to how Netflix releases its films, where there\u2019s been a focus on handing over creative control to filmmakers with a certain cultural capital and seeing what they cook up. It\u2019s helped a number of them realise their dream projects. And, for every misstep (think Bright or Duncan Jones\u2019s Mute), there\u2019s something like Roma, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s personal masterpiece and the winner of three Academy Awards. Next month, we\u2019ll finally get to see The Irishman, Martin Scorsese\u2019s long-gestating project starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Inc\n\nDisney can\u2019t realistically function this way. At least, it can\u2019t outside of its smaller, more independent offshoots (formerly Miramax and now, presumably, Fox Searchlight). It\u2019s simply not in its DNA, since the entire company bases itself around a single, cohesive vision that can be traced all the way back to Walt Disney himself. Its streaming service, then, is destined to play heavily into the familiar. In the first year after launch, you\u2019ll be able to watch every Star Wars and Pixar film in existence, alongside 5,000 episodes of Disney Channel and Disney Jr shows. They\u2019ll be nicely accompanied by new releases, including a Monsters Inc series and a Lizzie McGuire revival (featuring the triumphant return of Hilary Duff).\n\nAt the centre of it all is The Mandalorian, the jewel in Disney+\u2019s crown and the very first live-action Star Wars series. With December\u2019s The Rise of Skywalker bringing the latest trilogy to an end, and with nothing else locked in the release schedule, Lucasfilm is now looking towards television for its future. It gives the films a little breathing room, at least, if you\u2019re inclined to believe that Solo: A Star Wars Story\u2019s mediocre box office returns were the result of oversaturation. Set five years after Return of the Jedi, The Mandalorian stars Pedro Pascal as a bounty hunter navigating the outer reaches of the galaxy, home to the last gasps of a defeated empire. The trailers have so far lived up to Kathleen Kennedy\u2019s promise that the show would maintain the same quality as the films. It\u2019s gorgeous-looking, with echoes of the grittier aesthetics of 2016\u2019s Rogue One and plenty of nods to the samurai films and westerns that inspired it. The Mandalorian will be followed up by a series based on Rogue One characters Cassian Andor and K-2SO, with Ewan McGregor then stepping back into Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s shoes for his own spin-off.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off \u20ac2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show\u2019s 15 episodes than there are hostages. Netflix 2/20 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u20132018) Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It\u2019s been cancelled now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email. Netflix 3/20 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV \u2013 the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh \u2013 One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn\u2019t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran / nurse / single mother \u2013 who suffers from PTSD and depression \u2013 would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process. Netflix 4/20 Private Life (Film, 2018) Based on writer / director Tamara Jenkins\u2019s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie\u2019s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It\u2019s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised. Netflix 5/20 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep dive into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show\u2019s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly \u2013 and seemingly disastrously \u2013 changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones; Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig\u2019s wonderful turn as a talking vagina. Netflix 6/20 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016\u2013) Joe Swanberg\u2019s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you\u2019ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams \u2013 who you might remember from Todd Solondz\u2019s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness \u2013 is the show\u2019s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul. Netflix 7/20 Love (TV series, three seasons, 2016\u20132018) Community\u2019s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely \u2013 and arguably deeply unwise \u2013 relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus\u2019s pathological need to be the nice guy, we\u2019re never quite sure who or what we\u2019re rooting for \u2013 which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing. Netflix 8/20 Patton Oswalt: Annihilation (stand-up special, 2017) In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cstand-up special\u201d, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone. Netflix 9/20 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Granted, this horror-comedy \u2013 which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh \u2013 is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it\u2019s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila\u2019s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair\u2019s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn\u2019t quite like anything else on TV right now. Netflix 10/20 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is \u2013 in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he\u2019s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier\u2019s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world\u2019s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier\u2019s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims. Netflix 11/20 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) Based on Vikram Chandra\u2019s epic 2006 novel, Netflix\u2019s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games \u2013 which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster \u2013 only covered one quarter of Chandra\u2019s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d. Netflix 12/20 Dumplin\u2019 (Film, 2018) When the trailer for Dumplin\u2019 first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin\u2019 such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described \u201cfat girl\u201d who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin\u2019 is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist \u2013 and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot. Netflix 13/20 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) This sci-fi thriller \u2013 which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties \u2013 has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things. Netflix 14/20 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017) Though it\u2019s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015\u2019s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992. Netflix 15/20 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 \u2013 meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward\u2019s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life. John O Flexor/Netflix 16/20 Set It Up (Film, 2018) Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term \u201cover-dicking\u201d (it\u2019s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre. Netflix 17/20 Cargo (Film, 2017) Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable spanners in the works. Netflix 18/20 3% (TV series, two season, 2016\u2013) Like a cross between The Hunger Games and CW series The 100, this Brazilian dystopian thriller, set in an unspecified future, revolves largely around an impoverished community known as the Inland. Every year, each 20-year-old takes part in a series of tests; the highest scoring 3% will be chosen to live in paradise in the Offshore. It is an intriguing and addictive commentary on class and privilege. Netflix 19/20 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) With shades of John Ford's The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it's about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws\u2019 pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O\u2019Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O\u2019Connell, are on brilliant form. Netflix 20/20 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness \u2013 as too many shows tend to do \u2013 it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season. Netflix 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show.

Netflix 15/20 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 \u2013 meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward\u2019s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life. John O Flexor/Netflix 16/20 Set It Up (Film, 2018) Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term \u201cover-dicking\u201d (it\u2019s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre. Netflix 17/20 Cargo (Film, 2017) Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable spanners in the works. Netflix 18/20 3% (TV series, two season, 2016\u2013) Like a cross between The Hunger Games and CW series The 100, this Brazilian dystopian thriller, set in an unspecified future, revolves largely around an impoverished community known as the Inland. Every year, each 20-year-old takes part in a series of tests; the highest scoring 3% will be chosen to live in paradise in the Offshore. It is an intriguing and addictive commentary on class and privilege. Netflix 19/20 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) With shades of John Ford's The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it's about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws\u2019 pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O\u2019Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O\u2019Connell, are on brilliant form. Netflix 20/20 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness \u2013 as too many shows tend to do \u2013 it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season. Netflix\n\nMarvel is also making a big splash on the service, with shows such as Loki, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Hawkeye. An obvious tactic here is that Disney+ is trying to guarantee subscribers by teasing that certain characters introduced in its shows (namely Kamala Khan, who will get her own Ms Marvel series) will later appear in the films. Hand over your hard-earned dollars or risk getting Fomo, Marvel fans. What\u2019s most intriguing, however, is how risky some of these projects seem to be. Take What If\u2026?, an animated series based around alternate timelines, including one where Hayley Atwell\u2019s Peggy Carter gets injected with Captain America\u2019s supersoldier serum and starts wielding a Union Jack-emblazoned shield. Or what about WandaVision, which traps Elizabeth Olsen\u2019s Scarlet Witch and Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision in a 1950s sitcom?\n\nMuch like Netflix, Disney+ will almost certainly be keeping its viewing numbers tightly under wraps. Which, for them, might actually be a good thing, since they\u2019ll be less obsessively fixated on every release becoming a record-breaking hit. For example, it\u2019s given them the room to essentially resurrect the kind of mid-budget family fare that\u2019s been near impossible to make in the blockbuster age. Although Lady and the Tramp, on the surface, is just the latest in the studio\u2019s long line of live-action remakes, its use of real dogs \u2013 made to talk with a little CGI magic \u2013 feels reminiscent of the animal flicks that reigned supreme in the Nineties, including Homeward Bound and Babe. Add to that Togo, a film about a scrappy sled dog that, for some reason, stars Willem Dafoe. There\u2019s also some traditional Christmas fare in the form of Noelle, which sees Anna Kendrick play a member of the North Pole\u2019s own Kringle family, who heads off on the search for her missing brother, recently promoted as the new Santa Claus.\n\nYet the service is always going to be severely limited in what it can provide, since it\u2019s perpetually stuck inside the Disney mould. Disney+ will be a strictly family-friendly platform, with reports suggesting that Hulu will be developed in tandem as the home of more mature fare. Presumably, this is where some of the more valuable content that Disney acquired in the Fox merger will sit, although the studio\u2019s stayed very quiet on how it\u2019ll be handling franchises such as Alien. Even then, it\u2019s lacking the range Netflix can provide: they\u2019ve got their indie darlings and award winners, but they\u2019re also providing an absolute bounty of binge-ready nonsense, from property shows to low-budget horrors. It\u2019s the stuff we never like to admit that we watch, but still crave on occasion. Disney+ will have a small selection of reality programming, including Be Our Chef, a cooking competition, and Pixar in Real Life, a prank show. But it\u2019s all so achingly on-brand for Disney that it\u2019s hardly going to hit the same impulses as all of Netflix\u2019s glorious trash.\n\nIn short, Disney+\u2019s dominance isn\u2019t guaranteed. Its flashy line-up of properties is bound to attract big numbers at first but, in the long run, how well will it actually integrate into the average TV viewer\u2019s lifestyle? Does it have everything we could ever want from a streaming service? In truth, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interests that Disney+ faces a bit of an uphill battle and, maybe, even takes a few hits. Unchecked growth has been a major concern across many US industries, and the fact that Disney was behind five of this year\u2019s six highest-grossing films simply isn\u2019t healthy for the state of the industry. There\u2019s nothing compelling the studio to try anything new. The streaming world, however, is a younger, less-established market where the rules of success haven\u2019t quite been laid out yet. Netflix may be king for now, but its future isn\u2019t so secure \u2013 with more than 100 million subscribers, Amazon Prime is catching up fast. It\u2019s exactly as it should be. Competition is what breeds smart risks and bright ideas, as companies attempt to outmatch each other and grab our attention. And Disney could do with a little competition right now.", "description": "Disney+ is set to enter the streaming wars like a wrecking ball.
