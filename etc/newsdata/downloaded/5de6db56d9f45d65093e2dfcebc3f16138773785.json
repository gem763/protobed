Kids grow up fast, of course, and soon they\u2019re out in the real world trying to figure out what to do with real money. As a parent, how will you ensure that, when they begin \u201cadulting,\u201d they do it armed with the best financial advice available?\n\n\u201cChildren should be taught financial literacy at an early age to help put them on a path to health, happiness, and prosperity as adults,\u201d said Viraj Desai, senior manager, portfolio construction at TD Ameritrade. \u201cDropping a few coins into a piggy bank every day is good, but there\u2019s much more to it than that.\u201d\n\nAlthough parents are role models for their children, \u201cmany adults struggle to manage a budget, build up emergency funds, or maintain discipline when it comes to impulse purchases,\u201d Desai added.\n\nSpending money can be therapeutic and a bonding experience with your kids, but it\u2019s important to note that children learn by watching their parents. \u201cPoor financial behavior on the part of parents can often lead to children who grow up with similar habits,\u201d Desai said. New investors also need basics on financial advice, including budgeting and saving, and an understanding of how markets function. Desai pointed to three straightforward, easy-to-learn principles of financial literacy that can apply to both kids and adults.\n\nPrinciple #1: Delayed Gratification\n\nThis principle is about establishing long-term savings and getting familiar with banks and other financial institutions. \u201cBy opening a savings account, not only do you start developing a relationship with your local bank, you also build trust in the institution,\u201d Desai said. \u201cA relationship with a bank often leads to financial freedom and independence.\u201d\n\nBy becoming comfortable managing a checking account, you gain an entryway into wealth management and other financial services, because there\u2019s already an established base of trust.\n\nAnother key component: behavioral impulse control. Everyone has things they want. However, you may not be able to afford everything you want. Spending part of an income or allowance on something for short-term enjoyment is fine, but you\u2019d be wise to save the rest for the long term.\n\n\u201cInevitably, there will be something down the line you want,\u201d Desai said. \u201cWith delayed gratification, you\u2019re establishing financial discipline to save more and more over time as you prioritize purchases that are most meaningful to you.\u201d\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of impulse, credit cards are another aspect of personal finance and financial literacy where everyone must exercise caution and discipline. There\u2019s nothing wrong with teaching kids how to use a credit card, but they should be aware of the risks\u2014higher interest rates and the potential for huge balances to pile up quickly. Pay off that balance every month.\n\nPrinciple #2: Goal Planning\u2014Short and Long Term\n\nFor kids, this can be a difficult concept to unpack. Maybe a child wants a bike, scooter, or something that could cost a few hundred dollars. Is making a quick trip to your local sporting goods store and buying the thing really the best course of action for a parent? Instead, consider suggesting the child puts, say, $5 or $10 away each week, with the goal to save enough to eventually buy the item. This is the essence of goal planning\u2014an important step on the road to financial security and stability.\n\nAs Desai pointed out, this principle transfers into adulthood when you save for big-ticket items such as homes, cars, boats, and vacations.\n\n\u201cLearning how to stagger your goals also applies to retirement planning and to transferring assets to your kids,\u201d Desai said. \u201cBeing able to manage more complicated goal planning starts with managing simpler goal planning at a younger age.\u201d\n\nPrinciple #3: Emotional Maturity and Spending Discipline\n\nA child or young adult may not have the experience or frame of reference to envision the potential for a small amount of savings to gain greater value months or years ahead. They may need some help learning the concept of compound interest or how savings accounts, CDs, bonds, and other similar vehicles work.\n\n\u201cBy learning financial literacy earlier, a child can develop emotional maturity and discipline toward money that you can apply through the course of your life,\u201d Desai said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "For many adults, their first exposure to financial literacy was a dear old piggy bank, or perhaps a toy cash register that made a \u201cka-ching\u201d noise as it dispensed play money.
