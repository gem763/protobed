The public has a right to know. https://t.co/YV4UoxrPHI \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) August 31, 2019\n\nIt seems that wouldn\u2019t do a lot of harm, given that the public are the ones who elected him.\n\nRegardless, Debra\u2019s co-star affirmed his likemindedness:\n\nHey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with. Thx. https://t.co/7W3xPG3bI2 \u2014 Eric McCormack (@EricMcCormack) August 30, 2019\n\nSuch an attitude doesn\u2019t seem to be an anomaly in Tinseltown, but it\u2019s not the only game in town.\n\nSo conveyed Seinfeld\u2019s fantastic J. Peterman \u2014 actor John O\u2019Hurley \u2014 on Fox News program America\u2019s News HQ Monday.\n\nJohn explained there\u2019s more diversity in the land of the beautiful people than you might think. But conservatives tend to be lone wolves:\n\n\u201cI think they have the bully pulpit right now to say it out loud. I don\u2019t think it permeates Hollywood to the degree that you think it is. I think there is a nature among liberal thinkers to form packs, to form groups, whereas the conservative mind is basically an individual, and they\u2019re tougher to find.\u201d\n\nAs for Eric\u2019s and Debra\u2019s tweets, John spoke well of the two while characterizing their doxxing disposition as silly:\n\n\u201cLet me just say I\u2019m embarrassed for both of them because I know them both. I\u2019ve worked with Debra before. They\u2019re both smart people\u2026they do wonderful work. But they\u2019re pushing a case that falls apart from the sheer weight of its lunacy, as though the Hollywood community needs to be purged of this social and intellectual hygiene problem called conservative thinking. It underscores the fact that \u2018We aren\u2019t receptive to a diversity of thought,\u2019 which is the exact opposite of what you feel the liberal way would be. And I find that obscene.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s seen it firsthand:\n\n\u201cEvery time I have mentioned that I supported Trump in this election, people get vicariously angry at me, and they don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s possible that someone might think differently than they do. There is a band of conservatism in Hollywood, but it leans so much to one side that it doesn\u2019t allow for free discussion.\u201d\n\nDiversity of thought can be enriching, as the hilarious actor noted in his recollection of the good ol\u2019 Seinfeld days:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be a conservative in Hollywood. Even though there are many of us, you do feel you are an island fighting the storm\u2026 all viewpoints must be observed and respected. At the same time we are supporting free thinking, we also have to support free receptors \u2013 people that will allow other ideas to infect them. Some of the best convos I\u2019ve ever had on Seinfeld\u2026were with Michael Richards, who thinks totally different than I do. I couldn\u2019t wait to present him with an issue because I was always interested in his perspective. Brian Cranston\u2026is the complete opposite of me. We can sit for hours and discuss an idea\u2026not with the premise of trying to convince each other.\u201d\n\nThere it is \u2014 the open, respectful, civil discussion of ideas. That can be a wonderful thing. It\u2019s something we could use much more of, in this climate of closed ears mimicking the minds in between them.\n\nAs for Debra, I think she deserves some, well, Grace. The actress has previously suffered her own dealings with the mob:\n\nDebra Messing Celebrates Women Having Vaginas; The Woke Attack; She Admits Women Don\u2019t Have Vaginas\n\n-ALEX\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nTV Anchor Compares Her Black Co-Host To A Gorilla, But It Doesn\u2019t End The Way You\u2019d Expect.
