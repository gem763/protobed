There is only one working ambulance on Grand Bahama, floodwaters severely damaged the Rand Memorial Hospital in Freeport, and local nurses and physicians are among those who have lost their homes and loved ones, the minister said. Meanwhile, vehicles capable of moving supplies to victims are in short supply, even when roads to affected areas are passable.\n\nTo date, 44 deaths in the Bahamas have been attributed to Dorian, the strongest hurricane on modern record to hit the northwestern Bahamas. Officials expect that number to rise significantly as search-and-recovery teams make their way through the rubble on Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n\n\u201cThe human loss of life could be staggering or unimaginable,\u201d Mr. Sands said. \u201cThis is our Katrina moment.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said it has now rescued 308 people in the Bahamas since its response to Hurricane Dorian began.\n\nDorian, now categorized as a posttropical cyclone, is slowly weakening as it moves through the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canadian territory but still is producing high winds and heavy rains, according to the Canadian Hurricane Centre. The storm, with top sustained winds of 80 miles an hour, will continue to produce strong rain in parts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, it said.\n\nIn North Carolina, about 8,400 homes and businesses remain without power. Some 200 people were in shelters though Saturday and the numbers were falling, according to Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s office.\n\nMr. Cooper visited Morehead City and Ocracoke Island on Saturday to view storm damage as state and local emergency officials assessed preliminary damage from the storm. Search-and-rescue teams went house-to-house Saturday on Ocracoke Island to check on residents following a storm surge that brought catastrophic flooding to the island. Emergency crews are transporting gas trucks, generators, and food and water to the island.\n\nMr. Sands toured Grand Bahama on Saturday, and flew over Abacos shortly after the all-clear was given.\n\nHe said walking around the Mudd, which a recent government report described as the Bahamas\u2019 most densely populated shantytown, was something he won\u2019t easily forget. Dorian leveled the community in South Abaco.\n\n\u201cYou realize that this is where people once lived and there\u2019s just overturned cars and overturned trailers and mounds and mounds of splintered wood and clothing items, and an unimaginable smell,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com and Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "description": "Days after Hurricane Dorian deluged the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama with rain and massive storm surges, the logistical challenges of getting aid where it is needed are staggering, a top health official in the Bahamas said.", "authors": ["Erin Ailworth", "Joseph De Avila", "Erin.Ailworth Wsj.Com", "Joseph.Deavila Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105091/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
