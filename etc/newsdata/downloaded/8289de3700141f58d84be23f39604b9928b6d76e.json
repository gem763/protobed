It\u2019s thought that the ice was deposited over the course of billions of years by comets and asteroids hitting the moon.\n\nBut NASA hasn\u2019t yet had a chance to sample lunar soil on the ground and assess the extractability of that ice. And although China has landed two rovers on the moon over the past six years, they\u2019re not equipped with the necessary soil sampling tools.\n\nHow deep is the ice? How fine-grained is it? That\u2019s what VIPER aims to find out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly exciting to have a rover going to the new and unique environment of the south pole to discover where exactly we can harvest that water,\u201d Anthony Colaprete, VIPER\u2019s project scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, said in a news release. \u201cVIPER will tell us which locations have the highest concentrations and how deep below the surface to go to get access to water.\u201d\n\nAmes is managing the rover project, and the hardware is being designed by NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center. Four science instruments will be provided by Ames, Kennedy Space Center and Honeybee Robotics:\n\nThe Neutron Spectrometer System , or NSS, developed at Ames, will detect \u201cwet\u201d areas below the lunar surface for further investigation.\n\n, or NSS, developed at Ames, will detect \u201cwet\u201d areas below the lunar surface for further investigation.

The Near Infrared Volatiles Spectrometer System, known as NIRVSS, was developed by Ames and will use near-infrared readings to focus in on water content as well as concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane.\n\nNASA\u2019s plan calls for launching VIPER on a commercial rocket and putting it on the moon with a commercial lander, as part of its Commercial Lunar Payload Services arrangement with nine companies. Delivery to the moon is set for December 2022.\n\nThe rover will collect data on different kinds of soil environments affected by light and temperature \u2013 in areas of the south polar region that lie in complete darkness, areas that get occasional light, and areas that are exposed to direct sunlight.\n\nBy collecting data on the amount of water and other materials in each of those types of areas, NASA can map out where else water is likely to be accessible across the entire moon.\n\nVIPER\u2019s findings should be available by the time NASA sends its first astronauts to the moon\u2019s south polar region in the 2024 time frame, and they could guide decisions on where the Artemis program\u2019s follow-up missions go. Bridenstine said he would love to see a habitat placed on the moon\u2019s surface, and that habitat is going to need water, oxygen and fuel.\n\nOther highlights from Bridenstine\u2019s talk:\n\nBridenstine was asked whether SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy or future Starship rocket could contribute to the Artemis program. Bridenstine said he couldn\u2019t discuss that topic because SpaceX was likely to propose a lunar lander for NASA\u2019s use. \u201cWe want to go to the moon with commercial landers, and Starship of course is a commercial lander that we anticipate will be competing in this program,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we know that? No, but certainly it looks like they will be.\u201d Such a proposal would have to be submitted by Nov. 1.\n\nAnother question related to the potential for cooperation with China\u2019s space program. Bridenstine noted that bilateral cooperation was currently prohibited by U.S. legislation. \u201cCertainly in the future, depending on conditions, we would be open to that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just, \u2018Hey, sign up and you get to come with us.\u2019 \u201d China\u2019s U.S. visa problems relating to the International Astronautical Congress stirred a controversy this week.\n\nDuring a discussion of NASA space exploration, Bridenstine took note of the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt \u2014 and then took a controversial political stand. Noting that Pluto has a several moons, a thin atmosphere and probably a subsurface ocean as well, he said \u201cI believe Pluto is a planet.\u201d He said he thought the International Astronautical Union\u2019s 2006 planet definition, which included a clause on orbit-clearing, was poorly worded.\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "NASA says it'll send a rover to the moon's south pole by the end of 2022 to answer one of the biggest questions surrounding its Artemis moon program: Just how accessible is the water ice that's mixed in with moon dirt?
