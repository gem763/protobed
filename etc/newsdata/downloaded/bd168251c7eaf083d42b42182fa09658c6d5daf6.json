This fuels hurricanes, kills coral reefs, and threatens the safety and livelihoods of the 40% of the world\u2019s population who lives within 60 miles of the coast,\u201d Miriam Goldstein, a director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement this week. \u201cTo protect the ocean\u2019s natural ability to store carbon, to feed billions of people across the world, and to save ocean ecosystems, we must substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe report, which focuses on the ocean and the cryosphere, or the frozen parts of the planet, comes a little more than three weeks after Hurricane Dorian slammed into the northern Bahamas as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, obliterating entire communities and flooding 70% of Grand Bahama, an island of some 50,000 people. It also comes amid worldwide calls for dramatic climate action. More than 4 million people around the globe staged mass climate strikes in thousands of cities last Friday, spurred by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, and many more are expected to step out again on Sept. 27.\n\nSwedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, center, takes part during the Climate Strike, on Sept. 20, 2019 in New York.

In fact, global carbon emissions reached a record high in 2018, which was also the fourth hottest year ever recorded. Within the United States, the federal government under President Donald Trump has eviscerated many of the nation\u2019s premier environmental laws and withdrawn the country from the Paris deal in favor of a rapid expansion in fossil fuels and development.\n\nThe IPCC noted that while some of the most dire impacts of climate change may not come for several decades, many are already being felt in the oceans and ice caps and are almost sure to take place by 2100 if global emissions remain unchecked. Researchers said they were \u201cvirtually certain\u201d the oceans had warmed unabated since the 1970s, spurring acidification that has impacted biodiversity and harmed coral reefs. A widespread shrinking of the cryosphere has left large stretches of land uncovered by ice for the first time in millennia. And sea level rise is accelerating dramatically as all that ice melts.", "description": "Hundreds of millions of people in coastal areas would be threatened if climate change continues unabated, the UN's climate body warned.", "authors": ["Nick Visser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ijhQq_2uNpS7pGQRQy8eUQ--~B/aD0xNjY2O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8b057721000034005c600e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
