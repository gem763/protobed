Fellow airlines easyJet and Tui also saw shares rise today, by 8 and 9 per cent respectively in morning trading.\n\nHowever, the company said it remained 'very cautious' as the travel industry continues to face ongoing problems, including rising costs and waning consumer confidence in the face of a weaker pound and Brexit uncertainty.\n\nDart Group share price jumped following the trading update, to close 16% higher at \u00a310.90\n\nA weaker pound means higher costs for companies based in the UK, and also undermines the purchasing power of UK holidaymakers heading abroad.\n\n'In our leisure travel business we have continued to receive encouraging levels of later season bookings, with overall demand for both our flight-only offering and package holiday products continuing to strengthen,' Dart Group said.\n\n'We have also experienced increased levels of customer demand since Thomas Cook Group entered into compulsory liquidation in late September 2019 and we continue to assess the impact this will have for our business in the coming months.'\n\nBut it added: '[...] Given the cost pressures the travel industry is facing in general, which will intensify given the weakness in sterling, plus the deepening Brexit uncertainty and the impact this may have on consumer confidence, we remain very cautious in our outlook.'\n\nIn April, the Jet2 owner said its bookings for the summer had reflected uncertainty among consumers due to the volatile economic and political backdrop.\n\nRuss Mould at AJ Bell said Dart was always going to profit from the demise of Thomas Cook because it offers both flights and package holidays.\n\n'In particular, Jet2 was well placed to strengthen its market leading positions on the Iberian Peninsula given that the region represented a third of Thomas Cook\u2019s capacity,' he added.", "description": "Dart Group share price jumped 15 per cent to \u00a310.78 following the trading update.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
