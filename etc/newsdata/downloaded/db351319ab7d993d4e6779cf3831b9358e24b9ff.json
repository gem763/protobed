The single currency slipped to a fresh two-year low pressured by an increasingly weak outlook for the euro zone.\n\nThe greenback also steadied against the Australian dollar, near its strongest in three weeks, while it regained some ground handed to the New Zealand dollar on Thursday.\n\n\"The positive U.S. dollar trend, with lots of noise in between it, remains intact,\" said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer in Auckland.\n\nHe added that risk aversion driven by trade war fears, a resilient U.S. economy and increasingly less-dovish-than-expected language from U.S. Federal Reserve board members were supporting the greenback.\n\n\"There's a bit of political risk thrown in there as well via the Middle East and Brexit,\" he said.\n\nThe pound wallowed at $1.2325, close to a two-week low hit on Thursday after the European Union's Brexit negotiator said Britain had yet to provide \"legal and operational\" proposals for an agreement on exiting the bloc.\n\nBroader sentiment was fickle across markets.
