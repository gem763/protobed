I don\u2019t think he means to imply that he\u2019s weighing whether to cut Rudy loose. I think he means to say, \u201cWhy, do you people know something I don\u2019t?\u201d As if he\u2019s been caught off-guard and wondering if Giuliani said something to the media about no longer being Trump\u2019s attorney. Which he did not.\n\n#NEW: When asked if Rudy Giuliani is still his personal attorney, Pres. Trump says he doesn't know:pic.twitter.com/WV90eohc9X \u2014 Alex Salvi (@alexsalvinews) October 11, 2019\n\nAre you still Trump\u2019s lawyer? reporters asked Rudy afterward. Uh, yeah, Giuliani replied. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\n\nSo Trump says he hasn\u2019t spoken to Rudy. But Rudy tells me he spoke to Trump yesterday. Trump says he doesn\u2019t know if Rudy is his attorney. Rudy tells me he is and he has no reason to think he\u2019s not. \u2014 Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) October 11, 2019\n\nThe media invented a Trump/Rudy rift out of nothing, by aggressively misinterpreting Trump\u2019s answer! Fake news!\n\nOr is it?\n\nAs the career ambassador ousted by President Donald Trump was describing to lawmakers Friday the shadow diplomacy carried out by Rudy Giuliani, the President was across town beginning to doubt his attorney\u2019s continued ability to defend him. The skepticism, which is shared by many of Trump\u2019s allies, comes after two of Giuliani\u2019s clients were arrested boarding an international flight and charged for violating campaign finance laws. As the drama unfolded on television \u2014 complete with scowling mug shots paired with photos of the two men posing alongside the President \u2014 Trump began expressing concerns about Giuliani\u2019s involvement with the individuals, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAll I want from this season\u2019s remaining episodes of \u201cPresident Trump\u201d is a plot arc where Trump and Rudy turn on each other.\n\nMedia-watchers have noticed a bit of skepticism about Giuliani creeping into pro-Trump media today. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post devoted its front page this morning to Rudy\u2019s connections to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the two men arrested yesterday by the FBI for campaign-finance crimes hours before they left the country. This exchange about Giuliani popped up today on Trump TV as well:\n\nFox News is now openly pondering on the air: \"Is Rudy Giuliani becoming a liability for the White House?\" pic.twitter.com/pTscpY7SDx \u2014 Eric Kleefeld (@EricKleefeld) October 11, 2019\n\nNone of this is to suggest that Trump or the White House has instigated an anti-Rudy messaging campaign in Trump-friendly in order to gin up support on the right for throwing Giuliani under the bus. The message could be coming from the opposite direction, a communique from Murdoch World to Fox News\u2019s most loyal viewer that he should maybe start thinking of shedding his Rudy baggage. Especially as House Democrats start sniffing around the question of who, exactly, is paying Rudy Giuliani for all of his Ukraine work.\n\nBecause TrumpWorld is a realm of total chaos at all times, Giuliani isn\u2019t even the biggest personnel headache plaguing Trump\u2019s legal allies today. Apparently Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova hate Trey Gowdy, who\u2019s just joined the impeachment defense effort as outside counsel:\n\n\u201cTrey Gowdy doesn\u2019t know s***,\u201d she said\u2026 \u201cHe screwed up the Benghazi hearings, and he came out with the advice to Trump, \u2018Well, if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, just talk to Bob Mueller.\u2019\u201d\u2026 \u201cHe\u2019s not on the team. Trey Gowdy is not on the team. Who told you Trey Gowdy? Not to my knowledge, not to Rudy\u2019s knowledge, not Joe\u2019s knowledge,\u201d said Toensing, who had not heard of the move at the time of her interview with Yahoo News on Wednesday morning. \u201cI have to check that with Rudy because that would be a joke, because we all don\u2019t think much of him,\u201d she said of Gowdy, adding, \u201cAre you kidding? \u2026 Trey is a joke among us.\u201d\n\nThe joke\u2019s on her: Trump himself ended up announcing that Gowdy is joining the team, albeit not until January. (Which is almost certainly after impeachment will have happened.) What the hell is Gowdy doing working on this matter anyway, though? He spent his last months in Congress giving mopey interviews about how sick he was of partisan politics and how eager he was to get back to trying cases as a prosecutor. Fast-forward nine months and he\u2019s on Fox News every three days again and gearing up for the ultimate political clusterfark in impeachment.\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, here\u2019s Trump fresh off announcing a tentative \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with China declaring that Beijing\u2019s dispute with Hong Kong is going to \u201ctake care of itself.\u201d We\u2019ve spent a lot of virtual ink this week goofing on the NBA\u2019s social-justice warriors for looking the other way at Chinese oppression in the name of making a buck, but it\u2019s abundantly clear that the White House will keep its own mouth shut if the ChiComs end up cracking down hard on Hong Kong. Especially if a trade deal to answer Trump\u2019s economic prayers is in the process of being finalized and at risk of imploding if the U.S. says something \u201cproblematic\u201d about democracy and human rights.", "description": "Under the bus?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-14.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
