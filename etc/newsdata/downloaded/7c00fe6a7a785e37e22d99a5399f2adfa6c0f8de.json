U.S. gold futures GCv1 fell 0.4% to $1,493.\n\n\u201cConsidering the present uncertainties around the U.S.-China trade war and other geopolitical risks, gold still has potential upside,\u201d said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services, attributing the slight price dip to profit-taking.\n\nThe European Union backed a new Brexit deal with Britain on Thursday, prompting an uptick in Asian shares in early trade. However, gains were capped by disappointing economic growth data from China.\n\nWhile markets cheered progress on Brexit, doubts will resurface if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unable to secure UK parliament backing for the agreement to take Britain out of Europe on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cGold will be range-bound until and unless we have some clarity on Brexit and other geopolitical risks,\u201d said Brian Lan, of Singapore dealer GoldSilver Central, adding that he expects gold to trade around $1,475 to $1,503 per ounce over the short term.\n\nWorries surrounding a trade war between the United States and China continue to linger, with China\u2019s third-quarter economic growth slowing more than expected to its weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY at a near eight-week low has also supported gold.\n\nANZ Bank said it expects gold to be supported by elevated macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, with prices for under-supplied platinum group metals likely to push higher.\n\n\u201cThe palladium market is still structurally tight, keeping prices resilient, with intermittent volatility.\u201d\n\nAmong other precious metals, palladium XPD= rose 0.2% to $1,762.91 an ounce, a day after hitting a record high of $1,783.21. The autocatalyst metal was up 3.7% on the week and set for its best since the week of Sept. 13.\n\nPlatinum XPT= was down 0.2% at $885.40 while silver XAG= fell 0.1% to $17.51.", "description": "Gold prices dipped on Friday as investors booked profit after the European Union forged a new Brexit deal with Britain, though a floor was kept under prices by uncertainties over trade negotiations and the global economy.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442146401&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H03A", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
