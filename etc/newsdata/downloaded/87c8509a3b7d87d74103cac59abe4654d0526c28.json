from bad anxiety and my father was a cautious man who had a routine as regular as clockwork.\n\nHe\u2019d wake up at 7am and have poached eggs by 8am, arriving everywhere early and never late.\n\nIn my household we adopted the same traits.\n\nI was always good at sports and liked to socialise, but I was held back by stress and anxiety.\n\nI always worked hard, but when I got my first marketing job in my 20s, I realised that kind of environment was increasing my anxiety.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert, but the company was full of extroverts and I found it slightly painful.\n\nAs the lowest of the low in the company, I had a lot on my plate.\n\nOne day I remember looking at my to-do list and my brain just froze.\n\nI couldn\u2019t do anything and I couldn\u2019t understand it.\n\nI plucked up the courage to tell my boss and he was very kind and told me to take a week off, he wouldn\u2019t mention it to anyone, and to come back when I felt better.\n\nI went away and got help from the doctor.\n\nIt was put down to nothing more than a panic attack, so I got some short-term medication and hobbled through the next few years.\n\nA few years later, I moved on to work as a management trainer \u2013 I loved it.\n\nYes, I had to stand up and speak in front of huge crowds, but for most of the job I enjoyed hours of solitude.\n\nI could prepare work and travel to places in my own company.\n\nIt was at that point life got really good.\n\nI was successful at work, I married my long-term partner Mel and we had three children.\n\nEverything was blissful, but there was part of me that just wanted to do better.\n\nI was striving for the next good thing, so I joined forces with two other like-minded businessmen and the three of us formed our own company.\n\nWe were really successful together, travelling the world, but I quickly started to feel like a hamster on a wheel.\n\nI just couldn\u2019t cope or keep up \u2013 but I had waited for this opportunity for years and I wasn\u2019t going to give it up without a fight.\n\nSo I kept going, but it felt like Chinese water torture, every day just a drip more and it was getting worse and worse.\n\nAfter about nine months of this I just broke down.\n\nI remembered what had happened previously and I spoke to the doctor who suggested having two weeks off.\n\nMy mind was racing so much that the time off was uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I returned to work I took on a reduced work load, but I still struggled.\n\nI constantly wanted to speak to Mel about how I was feeling and wanted her full attention all the time \u2013 I was like a child.\n\nWill was seven, Emily, five, and Jack, two, all at the age they need their mum, but I was the most demanding of them all.\n\nI couldn\u2019t perform my normal dad duties and completely isolated myself from all the kids.\n\nI had no relationship with them whatsoever.\n\nI was on endless medication and after months of feeling low, in and out of work, I woke up one morning and the future just seemed completely bleak.\n\nI realistically couldn\u2019t go back to that job, but I had mortgage commitments and was the breadwinner.\n\nIt was July, the start of the school holidays, and I couldn\u2019t imagine six weeks at home with the kids.\n\nI felt so suicidal that I was convinced me dying would do everyone a favour.\n\nMel had taken the children to a friend\u2019s house so I remember clearly thinking, \u2018It\u2019s got to be now really\u2019.\n\nI had no thoughts about my family, no fear.\n\nMy mind wasn\u2019t working normally.\n\nI remember nothing else.\n\nI was airlifted to hospital and miraculously only suffered a collapsed lung and a nasty head injury.\n\nThe police had informed Mel and when I came round she was sat there with one of her more outspoken friends, Sally.\n\nI made a joke and they smiled.\n\nI hadn\u2019t done that in months.\n\nI felt the fog lift off me.\n\nI was gravely aware of the impact my suicide attempt had on my family, but I also felt instantly better.\n\nI felt like a kid who had been given a new toy.\n\nI woke up like a newborn foal, full of the joys of spring.\n\nIt felt like a second chance.\n\nI saw everything differently and didn\u2019t want to go to sleep at night and looked forward to waking up in the morning.\n\nIt was a wonderful feeling.\n\nPerhaps it felt like that because I knew I\u2019d hit rock bottom.\n\nThe only way was up.\n\nI was in hospital for two weeks and caught a few infections along the way.\n\nThe list of drugs I was on was silly: anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, sleeping tablets, anti-psychotic drugs, antibiotics\u2026\n\nI was diagnosed with agitated depression, which is when you get so stressed you can no longer operate.\n\nMy wife asked them to take me off anything that wasn\u2019t essential and just give me a mild anti-depressant to keep things at bay.\n\nIt worked.\n\nBreakdown and Repair, A Father's Tale of Stress and Success\n\nAs the weeks passed and I recovered at home, I had periods where I was fragile and tearful as the shock of the incident sunk in.\n\nBut I had good times too \u2013 in fact, I had the best holiday I\u2019ve ever been on in my life.\n\nWe went to Bournemouth with the kids, and I had ice cream, was able to play with them and do ridiculously simple things that had previously seemed impossible.\n\nThen ever so slowly, I got ready to sell my shares to my business partners and instead I started working freelance for them.\n\nI was so relieved I was able to turn on a computer and not feel overwhelmed.\n\nI had a second chance to make things right.\n\nI\u2019d spent years busting a gut, but now I\u2019m confident I\u2019ve been a good husband and dad.\n\nHitting rock bottom made me realise that I am not a sharp businessman.\n\nI can still be creative, but need to enjoy my family life too.\n\nI never reached out to the driver of the lorry, but I want to apologise to him for any distress I might have caused.\n\nI want to make a point that it was not any fault of his, but all mine.\n\nI\u2019ve had years of therapy, I have no qualms in saying I still take anti-depressants and I adhere to all the basics of looking after myself: eating right, sleeping, exercising and socialising.\n\nI\u2019ve written a book about my experiences and I hope to speak out further about mental health.\n\nTo come out of my experience alive and happy is a miracle.\n\nIf my story helps just one person, that would make me so happy.\n\nI refuse to let anxiety define my life any longer.\n\nThursday 10 October marks World Mental Health Day, and stress at work affects so many of us nationwide\u2026\n\n\u25cf Last year, work-related stress and mental illness accounted for over half of the UK\u2019s work absences.\n\n\u25cf 15.4 million working days were lost last year to stress.\n\n\u25cf Workers in the education industry suffered the highest, with 2,100 new and long-standing cases per 100,000 workers in 2018. Social workers are the next most at risk with 2,080 cases per 100,000.\n\n\u25cf Yorkshire and the Humber has the highest self-reported rates, with an average of 1,830 individuals per 100,000 workers reporting high levels of work stress.\n\n- If you\u2019re feeling anxious or stressed at work, speak to your manager or HR department.
