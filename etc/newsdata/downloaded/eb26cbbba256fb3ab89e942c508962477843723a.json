Trump administration officials have said it is effective at keeping people out of the US and is improving due process \u2013 the opposite of what advocates on the border have reported.\n\nThis month, Human Rights First revealed at least 340 reports of rape, kidnapping, torture and other violent attacks against people returned to Mexico while they wait for their case to be heard in US immigration court\n\nMargaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said people they visited in camps in Matamoros, where more than 2,000 people are staying in squalid conditions, expect to be kidnapped and many had been kidnapped more than once.\n\n\u201cThis expectation is part of the daily life waiting for their asylum cases to be considered,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that they all know will happen and it adds incredible stress to the already existing trauma these people have experienced.\u201d\n\nKate Allen, executive director of Amnesty International UK, said \u201cpeople\u2019s lives are absolutely being ruined\u201d by the Remain in Mexico policy.\n\n\u201cThis chaos of 50,000 people is completely self-inflected and unnecessary,\u201d Allen said.\n\nLike the other leaders, she commended the work of shelter operators in Mexico, legal aid providers, teachers and other volunteers trying to help refugees at the border. Allen said: \u201cIn all this what is quite wonderful is to see the way that civil society on both sides of the border is doing absolutely everything it can do, so ordinary people, who are taking action.\u201d", "description": "Leaders from US, UK, Kenya, Mexico, Greece and Canada said immigration program manufactured a crisis at border", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bee714ce6a208f7fd1154714036c633eb69de00/0_0_5631_3379/master/5631.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=055b93eb1d235b76913a562ce05f2dc3", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
