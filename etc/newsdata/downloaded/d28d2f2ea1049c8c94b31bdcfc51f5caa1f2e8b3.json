Daniel Jones couldn't do much with Saquon Barkley, Evan Engram and Sterling Shepard all inactive for the Giants (2-4).\n\nTom Brady shockingly rushed for two touchdowns in an up-and-down day leading the Patriots offense. It was enough to improve to 6-0 on the season, moving two wins clear of everyone else in the NFL.\n\nNotable Fantasy Stats\n\nTom Brady, QB, Patriots: 31-of-41, 334 passing yards, 1 INT, 5 carries, 6 rushing yards, 2 rushing TDs\n\nSony Michel, RB, Patriots: 22 carries, 86 rushing yards, 2 catches, 27 receiving yards\n\nJames White, RB, Patriots: 9 catches, 46 receiving yards\n\nJulian Edelman , WR, Patriots: 9 catches, 113 receiving yards\n\n, WR, Patriots: 9 catches, 113 receiving yards Daniel Jones, QB, Giants: 15-of-31, 161 passing yards, 1 TD, 3 INTs\n\nJonathan Hilliman , RB, Giants: 11 carries, 38 rushing yards\n\n, RB, Giants: 11 carries, 38 rushing yards Golden Tate, WR, Giants: 6 catches, 102 receiving yards, 1 TD\n\nDefense and Special Teams Again Lead Patriots\n\nFor a team that has one of the best quarterbacks of all time, the Patriots defense has been the bigger story this season.\n\nEntering the day allowing just 6.8 points per game with 12 takeaways in five games, the defense was on point once again with several game-changing turnovers:\n\nDaniel Jones struggled with his accuracy, but the defense was there to capitalize every time.\n\nThe special teams also took advantage of mistakes, especially with a touchdown off a \"blocked\" punt:\n\nThese types of plays took the pressure off the offense, which was needed with Tom Brady not looking like himself early:\n\nThe Patriots offense also gave up a touchdown off a strip-sack, which helped keep the game close.\n\nBrady and the offense eventually did enough to pull out the win, but it was the defense that carried the Patriots to victory Thursday.\n\nTurnovers Kill Giants Dreams of Upset\n\nIt was an uphill battle trying to move the football against an elite defense without his best weapons, but Jones hurt his own cause with three interceptions.\n\nA fumble by Jonathan Hilliman in the fourth quarter that was returned for a touchdown then helped seal the Giants' fate.\n\nThis ruined an impressive night from the Giant defense, which made Brady uncomfortable all night and had several key stops on its own end.\n\nThe unit also followed up a big touchdown from Golden Tate with a Markus Golden return for a touchdown:\n\nWhile this raised the Giants' hopes Thursday night, it's nearly impossible to win on the road when you commit four turnovers. If New York wants to find more success in the future, it will need to cut down on the mistakes.\n\nStill, the defense, in particular, can hold its head up high after a strong performance against the defending champions.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nThe Patriots have a long gap until their next game on Monday, Oct. 22 against the 0-4 New York Jets. The 11-day break nearly gives the squad a second bye week.\n\nThe Giants will return home for a winnable game against the 1-3-1 Arizona Cardinals.", "description": "The New England Patriots put more separation between themselves and the rest of the  NFL  with a 35-14 Thursday night win over the New York Giants.
