TRU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nForkner\u2019s lawyer David Gerger told Reuters: \u201cThe simulator was not reading right and had to be fixed to fly like the real plane.\u201d\n\nEarlier in their conversation, Gustavsson asks Forkner whether he could get anything done in the simulator or if he experienced the \u201cnormal chaos.\u201d That likely refers to general software issues, the former Boeing employees said.\n\nForkner then says MCAS was \u201crunning rampant in the sim on me\u201d. He describes what he experienced: \u201cI\u2019m leveling off at like 4000 ft, 230 knots and the plane is trimming itself like craxy (sic). I\u2019m like, WHAT?\u201d\n\nGustavsson responds that he experienced similar patterns with MCAS, \u201cbut on approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn approach\u201d is when pilots line up the aircraft to land. At a certain elevation, pilots typically extend the aircraft\u2019s flaps, the former Boeing employees said.\n\nBoeing has said MCAS only operates when the flaps are retracted, so it would be unusual that Gustavsson would have experienced the same behavior on approach, with flaps extended, the former Boeing employees said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An aerial photo shows Boeing 737 MAX aircraft at Boeing facilities at the Grant County International Airport in Moses Lake, Washington, September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if he is describing glitches in the simulation, or if it\u2019s actually an MCAS misbehavior,\u201d Ludtke said.\n\nPilots have complained they did not know about the existence of MCAS before the Lion Air crash in October 2018. In a separate set of emails released by the FAA on Friday, Forkner told the agency in January 2017 that the company would delete references to MCAS from the flight operator\u2019s manual \u201cbecause it is outside the normal operating envelope.\u201d\n\nIn marketing the 737 MAX, Boeing said current 737 pilots would only need computer-based training on the new narrowbody model rather than simulator training, which is more costly. The FAA approved the training requirements when it certified the aircraft in 2017.", "description": "In newly released instant messages from 2016, a top Boeing Co 737 MAX test pilot tells a colleague that the jet's MCAS flight control system - the same one linked to two fatal crashes - was \"running rampant in the (simulator) on me.\"", "authors": ["Eric M.
