That will only be possible if and when the U.K. parliament and the European Parliament ratify the deal reached between London and Brussels last week which was endorsed by EU leaders on Thursday at the European Council.\n\nOne Commission official confirmed that the Commission chose the name \"U.K. Task Force,\" because the acronym for Task Force U.K. (TFUK) sounds like an expletive.\n\nThe new group led by Barnier \u2014 a former French minister and two-time commissioner \u2014 would be effective once the Commission officially starts its work, which is likely to happen on December 1, a month later than expected. One diplomat said the task force would not sit within any one directorate general (notably DG Trade.) Rather it will coordinate the work of several DGs. Since June, Sabine Weyand, a trusted deputy of Barnier's, has been DG Trade's director general.\n\nBarnier is widely regarded as having done a good job since 2016 as Brexit negotiator. He has, by and large, maintained the unity of the 27 remaining EU countries and managed to negotiate not one, but two Brexit deals with two different U.K. governments. He had been mooted as a potential candidate for French commissioner after Emmanuel Macron's nominee, Sylvie Goulard, was rejected by the European Parliament.", "description": "The EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator is widely regarded as having done a good job after maintaining EU unity and striking 2 deals with the UK.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "David M.
