Many investors fear that we are heading towards a recession as a result of the inversion of the yield curve, a key recession indicator, as well as the ongoing trade war with China\n\nAccording to CFO\u2019s polled by Duke University, these fears are justified. Based on the survey, 53% of U.S. CFOs believe the market will enter into a recession by the 2020 elections. Two thirds predict a recession will come by year-end 2020.\n\n\u201cBusiness optimism has not been this low since September 2016, a time when the unemployment rate was 5%. Optimism is low in all regions of the world, which exacerbates any slowdown occurring in the US,\u201d John Graham, a finance professor at Duke University who directed the study, stated.\n\nThat being said, large-cap med tech stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date while small and mid-cap stocks have surpassed the Russell 2000 over the same time period. With this in mind, Needham\u2019s Michael Matson stated on September 24 that he believes 3 med tech stocks have earned a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating despite the rising recession risk. This is a rating Needham gives to stocks that have especially strong long-term growth narratives.\n\nUsing data from TipRanks, we wanted to dig a little deeper to determine if the five-star analyst\u2019s picks really are poised to outperform.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nBoston Scientific Corporation\n\nDespite some recent shakiness, Boston Scientific (BSX- Get Report) has gained 19% year-to-date, with Matson expecting even more growth regardless of the economic climate.\n\nThe med tech company manufactures medical devices such as defibrillators and pacemakers to provide patients with less invasive medical solutions. However, Matson does point out that one of BSX\u2019s strengths is its structural heart products which could fuel significant sales for the company.\n\nBack in April, BSX received FDA approval for its LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System that uses transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) technology to treat severe aortic stenosis, or the narrowing of the aortic valve opening. Adding to the good news, its WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device reached 100,000 patient implants globally as of September 18.\n\nThe company has also made significant progress in terms of its efforts to expand its interventional oncology, arterial and venous therapy product offerings. BSX completed its $4.2 billion acquisition of BTG plc on August 26 in order to expand its reach in these areas.\n\n\u201cOver the longer-term, we think that the BTG deal has the potential to be accretive to BSX\u2019s revenue growth and margins,\u201d Matson commented. He adds that its limited capital equipment sales exposure makes it less vulnerable in a recession. As a result, the five-star analyst rated BSX a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and maintained the $53 price target. He believes share prices could surge 26% over the next twelve months, which is the highest upside predicted out of all other analysts covering the stock.\n\nAll in all, Wall Street echoes the analyst\u2019s sentiment. 15 Buy ratings vs 2 Holds assigned in the last three months add up to a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus. Its $49 average price target indicates 15% upside potential.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The recession alarm bells have been sounded.
