The whole circus has become too choreographed in recent years and the All Blacks' opponents should be able to respond, within reason, rather than just stand passively. World Rugby are considering fining England for their actions. Here's a tip: don't. It was gold.\n\nFLUSH THE SPIDER OUT\n\nThere had been much fanfare at this World Cup about the revolutionary 'spider-cam' footage transforming the viewing experience. It is also drawing complaints, however, and with good reason. The overhead angles are being used too often for 'live' sequences and you lose perspective. Save the new aerial shots for replays.\n\nWHISTLE BLOWN\n\nSpare a thought for one unfortunate Englishman this week. Wayne Barnes is regarded by many as the world's finest referee, but will now miss out on taking charge of the final after his compatriots made it there. Barnes was not chosen for either of the semi-finals, and the suspicion was that he was being saved for the final. Not now.\n\nEnglish referee Wayne Barnes will not referee next week's final due to his countrymen's win\n\nTEAR UP THE SCRIPT\n\nNew Zealand face a dilemma now their empire has collapsed. With head coach Steve Hansen leaving, the country's union must decide whether to stick to the plan \u2014 assistant coach Ian Foster taking over. They surely now need an experienced figurehead; a Warren Gatland or Joe Schmidt, for instance.\n\nNew Zealand chiefs now have a big decision to make on how they wish to rebuild their empire\n\nTHE TURNING TIDE\n\nYokohama Stadium was not full for either semi-final and was eerily quiet at times yesterday, whereas at least the atmosphere was good for the England v New Zealand game.\n\nWhile the majority of Japanese spectactors present sided with the All Blacks to start with, it was noticeable how the support for England grew louder \u2014 deservedly.\n\nThe Yokohama Stadium was eerily quiet for both semi final games and was not at full capacity\n\nBALANCE REDRESSED\n\nThe north-south divide has gone, and not before time. For too long, the balance of power lay in the southern hemisphere.\n\nSeven of the eight World Cups have been won by teams from the south and in 2015 they locked out the semi-finals. Now, it has evened up. Expect a French revival on home soil in 2023 to tip the balance to the north.", "description": "CHRIS FOY'S WEEKEND VERDICT: England's 'V' formation to face the Haka added to the sense of occasion and anticipation.
