This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.\"\n\nThe removal of the \"will act as appropriate\" phrase is viewed by some as hawkish, but it is likely that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will reiterate that the Fed remains \"data dependent.\"\n\nThere is no great surprise here, and the market reaction is fairly mild so far. There will be more reaction to Powell when he holds the standard press conference in a few minutes.\n\nOverall, the door is still open for another cut this year, and that is enough to satisfy for the market for now.\n\nThe market won't have much time to digest the interest rate news, as the focus is going to quickly shift to earnings from Apple (AAPL) . Apple has had a decent two-day pullback after a strong run, so that changes the dynamics, but it is still an extended chart and many traders will be looking for a sell the news reaction.", "description": "The Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates a quarter-point as expected, but some view statement as more hawkish....AAPL", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Door Cracked Open For Additional Rate Cut In", "The Federal Open Market Committee Cut Interest Rates A Quarter-Point As Expected", "But Some View Fed Statement As More Hawkish.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Tom Graff", "Bruce Kamich", "Timothy Collins", "Real Money"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1580c893-b3d8-11e9-b14e-cfd1c24a79c0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
