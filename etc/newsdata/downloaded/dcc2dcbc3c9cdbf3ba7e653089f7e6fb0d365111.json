There was also 100 bonus points on the purchase of a porridge pot costing 50p.\n\nKaren added: 'I don't even like bananas \u2013 I was donating them to hostels and the homeless.\n\n'A pot of hot porridge and a banana makes a really good breakfast for someone in need.\n\n'I would quite happily stand at a self-service till with a basket of fifty bananas and pay for them all individually.'\n\nShe said the checkout supervisors at Sainsbury's asked her what she was doing when she was buying the bananas and porridge and she told them.\n\n'They were happy to hear about what I was doing, even downloading the app to use themselves and they let me get on with it, even giving me keyboard shortcuts on the till to help me go a bit quicker.'\n\nWhilst Karen believes this is a potential loophole in the system, staff at Sainsbury's never advised it was against any rules and if this was the case, she says she should have been told by the team, rather than just having her card blocked.\n\nSince This is Money contacted Nectar regarding the issue, Karen's card has been unblocked with all \u00a3370 of her points still available as well as an extra thousand points as initially promised to her by a member of the Nectar team.\n\nA Nectar spokesperson said: 'We have apologised to Karen for the delay and reactivated her card.'\n\nSince receiving the news, Karen has said that she is going to try and cash out the funds as soon as possible, just in case something like this happens again.\n\nThis isn't the first time This is Money has reported on customers having issues with their Nectar card.\n\nA number of Nectar users complained last year about having points go missing from their Nectar account with no explanation.", "description": "Karen Matthews, 47, first found that her card had been blocked when she received a notification on her Nectar app that stated her points balance was currently unavailable at the beginning of August.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
