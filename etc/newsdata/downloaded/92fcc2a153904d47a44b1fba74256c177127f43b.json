(Jekesai Njikizana, AFP)\n\nThe body of Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe was buried on Saturday in his rural village of Kutama, an AFP reporter at the scene said.\n\nThe family of Mugabe gathered in his rural homestead, three weeks after his death, to attend a much-awaited burial ceremony.\n\nMugabe died in a Singapore hospital on September 6, aged 95, almost two years after a military coup ended his despotic 37-year rule.\n\nHis remains will be laid to rest in the courtyard of his home in the district of Zvimba, about 90 kilometres west of the capital Harare.\n\nHundreds of mourners assembled for the low-key event, which was initially intended to be a private family ceremony.\n\nMany wore white Mugabe-emblazoned T-shirts with the slogans \"founding father\", \"liberator\" and \"torch bearer\".\n\nSome were singing and dancing. Others sat quietly under two white tents set up for the occasion.\n\nMugabe's widow Grace and his children accompanied the casket - drapped in Zimbabwe's green, yellow, red and black flag.\n\nThe coffin of former president of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe arrives for his burial at his home village in Kutama, on 28 September 2019.

(Jekesai Njikizana, AFP)\n\nNo senior government officials were among the audience.\n\nThe Mugabe family opted to bury Zimbabwe's founding father in Kutama after weeks of wrangling with the government, who wanted the body to rest at the National Heroes Acre in Harare.\n\nA mausoleum was being constructed at the site, which is reserved for heroes of Zimbabwe's liberation struggle.\n\n\"What we have done is his wish,\" said Grace's older sister Shuvai Gumbochuma, addressing mourners in Shona.\n\n... he didn't want to be buried at the heroes acre\n\n\"He (Mugabe) said with his own mouth that he didn't want to be buried at the heroes acre.\"\n\nRuling ZANU-PF party described the family's decision as \"most unfortunate\".\n\n\"All patriotic Zimbabweans were shocked to learn that the remains of the former president had been surreptitiously taken yesterday to Zvimba for a private burial,\" said spokesperson Simon Khaya-Moyo in a statement on Friday.\n\nFormer guerilla leader Mugabe took power after independence from white minority rule in 1980.\n\nInitially hailed as a pan-African liberator, Mugabe's rule became increasingly repressive as he cracked down on his political opponents.\n\nThis combined with a series of disastrous economic policies that drove millions of Zimbabweans abroad.\n\nMugabe was eventually toppled by his formerly loyal military generals in 2017.\n\nMany in the family are bitter over his ouster and the role played by his deputy and successor Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was elected president in 2018.\n\nThe army turned against Mugabe after he sacked Mnangagwa, a move many saw as an attempt to position Grace to succeed him.\n\nZimbabwe remains deeply split over his legacy.\n\n\"I was very comfortable that he be buried at the heroes acre,\" said local official Christopher Ndlovu before the ceremony.\n\n\"That's what we wanted as local villagers. But since it's a family decision to bury him here, we will respect it.\"", "description": "The family of former Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe gathered in his rural homestead on Saturday, three weeks after his death, to attend a much-awaited burial ceremony in the village of Kutama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9276/b240d994c90a4d1cb62095e2b6b5af6e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
