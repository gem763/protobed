[nL3N26G11O]\n\nIt boasts four runways and is expected to handle up to 72 million passengers a year by 2025, eventually reaching 100 million.\n\nChina Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines will be the main domestic carriers at Daxing, though Air China will provide a small number of flights too.\n\nAn Air China flight to Bangkok was the first international flight to leave on Sunday, while British Airways will operate the first transcontinental flight, to London.\n\nAbout 50 foreign airlines, including Finnair, plan to move all or part of their China operations to the airport in the coming quarters.\n\nThe relocation of all the airlines which will use Daxing is to due to be completed by the winter of 2021. Air China and its Star Alliance partners will remain mostly at Capital airport.\n\nThe airport, roughly the size of 100 football fields and expected to become one of the world's busiest, has come in for some criticism due to its distance from central Beijing.\n\nBy public transport it takes over an hour to reach it from Beijing's central business district, more than double the time needed to reach Capital airport, which strains at the seams and is often hit by delays.\n\nOfficials say Daxing airport is not only designed to serve Beijing, but also the surrounding province of Hebei and next-door city of Tianjin, to boost regional development.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard.
