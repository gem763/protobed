I got here at 7am... to give my voice to our new leader who must protect our democracy,\u201d said Lilia Amri, 36, a bank worker.\n\nTunisia threw off autocratic rule eight years ago in a revolution that inspired \u201cArab Spring\u201d revolts in Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Syria, but it alone has enjoyed a peaceful transition to democracy.\n\nHowever, a perceived decline in living standards since the 2011 uprising, with higher unemployment and inflation, has frustrated many voters and turnout for local elections last year was only 34%.\n\nIn the central Lafayette district of Tunis, dozens of people stood patiently queuing in the Rue de l\u2019Inde primary school in a whitewashed stucco courtyard under sky blue wooden shutters.\n\nKholoud Alwi, 27, said none of the candidates had convinced her. \u201cBut I have to vote. It\u2019s important for the country,\u201d she said.\n\nHeavily indebted, Tunisia\u2019s next government, like its last, will have to navigate popular demands to relax public purse strings while foreign lenders push for spending cuts.\n\nMany voters are disillusioned. In the poor Ettadamen district, Mouaz Chneifiya, a 42-year-old unemployed man, was sitting in a cafe and said he would not vote.\n\n\u201cSince the election we\u2019ve been getting promises and nothing is done on the ground, so why vote? The elections will end and the promises will be dropped as soon as they get into office like in past elections,\u201d he said.\n\nA man reads his ballot paper at a polling station during presidential election in Tunis, Tunisia, September 15, 2019. REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed\n\nWhile foreign attention, especially in Arab countries, is focused on the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, Tunisians have been engrossed by the fate of media mogul Nabil Karoui, running from behind bars.\n\nA court on Friday ruled he must stay in detention after his arrest last month on suspicion of money laundering and tax evasion, which he denies. His supporters say he has been silenced.\n\nPrime Minister Youssef Chahed, as well as two former prime ministers, a former president and the defense minister are also standing. Two of the 26 candidates have withdrawn in recent days to support a rival, though their names still appear on the ballots.\n\nCROWDED FIELD\n\nWith so many in the race, Sunday\u2019s vote could produce a very close outcome, with few votes separating the two candidates who make the second-round run-off, due by Oct. 13, from the others.\n\nThe election was brought forward after the death in July of the incumbent Beji Caid Essebsi.\n\nAnalysts have warned that a close outcome, with several candidates near the cut-off point to make the second round, could make appeals likely.\n\nTunisia\u2019s president has direct control over foreign and defense policy while most other portfolios are handled by a prime minister chosen by parliament, for which an election will be held on October 6.\n\nWith that limited role, many candidates have emphasized their policies on security - an area in which Tunisia has improved since two jihadist attacks in 2015 killed scores of tourists, devastating the country\u2019s tourism sector.\n\nA pair of armed soldiers stood outside each polling station Reuters visited.\n\nDespite economic frustrations, many voters said they were proud of Tunisia\u2019s march to democracy.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nOutside the capital, in the village of Sidi Thabet, six middle-aged men sat debating the merits of rival campaigns in a field under the shade of a gum tree, having pulled chairs over from the cafe opposite.\n\nThey each had the inky forefinger that showed they had voted, and were united in concern at the poor level of public services in a local economy based on growing olives, vegetables and fruit, though they supported different candidates.\n\n\u201cWe all voted for different candidates but despite our differences, we are discussing it peacefully,\u201d said Noureddine Dridi, a service manager at a company.", "description": "Tunisians lined up to choose from a diverse field of candidates on Sunday, in an unpredictable election for a new president at a time of economic pain in the young democracy.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430096781&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0AT", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
