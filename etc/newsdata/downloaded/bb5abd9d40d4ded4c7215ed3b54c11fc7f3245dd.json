I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nOn Friday, Morey took to Twitter to show solidarity with a months-long anti-government protest in the Chinese territory. He sent a tweet that read: \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nIt was quickly deleted, but not before it attracted notice in both China and the U.S.\n\nSoon after, the Rockets' owner, Tilman Fertitta, sought to distance the team from the controversy, tweeting that Morley \"does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets\" and that the team is \"NOT a political organization.\"\n\nListen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd on Sunday, the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 headed by former Rockets center and Hall of Famer Yao Ming, announced that it was suspending cooperation with the Houston team. Tencent, a media partner of the NBA in China with a five-year streaming deal worth $1.5 billion, and China's state television also said they wouldn't be airing Rockets games.\n\nNBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement late Sunday that Morey's original tweet was \"regrettable.\"\n\n\"We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the N.B.A. can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\" he said.\n\nTexas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz took exception to the apology, tweeting, \"As a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protesters,\" adding in a separate tweet, \"We're better than this; human rights shouldn't be assisting Chinese communist censorship.\"", "description": "On Friday, Daryl Morey tweeted: \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\" But he issued an apology after receiving backlash from the Chinese Basketball Association and others.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/07/ap_19280110763077_wide-91252ff29206edfe19bad92f1d07c6c472a94bd5.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
