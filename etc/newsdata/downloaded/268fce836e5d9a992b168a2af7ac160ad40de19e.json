They did not look at invertebrates or marine animals.\n\nAccording to their analysis, 5,579 animals - 18% of vertebrates - are currently being traded globally.\n\nAn additional 3,196 species are considered at risk - making a total of 8,775 species, or about one in three.\n\nImpacts of trade appeared to be higher in threatened species, among certain groups - birds and mammals - and concentrated in specific parts of the globe.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "description": "At least one in five vertebrate species on Earth are bought and sold on the wildlife market.", "authors": ["Helen Briggs", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14D4E/production/_109062358_gettyimages-1140241817.jpg"}
