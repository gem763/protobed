She ignored Mr Salvini's order to keep her charity ship out of Italian waters.\n\nAnd a mayor who defied Mr Salvini by sheltering migrants in the southern town of Riace saw his ban lifted.\n\nAn independent has replaced Mr Salvini.\n\nShe is Luciana Lamorgese, a career civil servant and immigration specialist. She is expected to bring Italy closer to its EU partners on immigration, ending Mr Salvini's strident campaign against the charity ships rescuing migrants off Libya.\n\nThe new government has 10 ministers from populist party Five Star (M5S) and nine from the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), with independent Giuseppe Conte remaining prime minister.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Three of the seven women ministers (L-R): Paola Pisano (technological innovation); Paola De Micheli (transport); Luciana Lamorgese (interior)\n\nWith an average age of 47, the government is the youngest in Italian history. And seven of the 21 ministers are women.\n\nFive Star and the PD have long been political rivals, but agreed on a coalition after Mr Salvini's League tried to force a snap election, clashing with Mr Conte.\n\n'Avoid quarrel with Brussels'\n\nThe coalition must still win confidence votes in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) and Senate (upper house) on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. It is expected to win both, though it has only a slim majority in the Senate.\n\nMr Salvini is bitterly critical of the EU, accusing the bloc of letting Italy become \"Europe's refugee camp\". But the new EU Affairs Minister, Vincenzo Amendola, said \"the parties in this government will do their utmost not to quarrel with Brussels, not to have pointless fights or rows\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Carola Rackete: People are terrified on these boats\n\nIn recent years Italy, like Greece, has struggled to cope with migrant boats sailing from North Africa or Turkey.\n\nThey are on the front line of the crisis, as people-smuggling gangs exploit migrants desperately fleeing war or dire poverty.\n\nCase against Salvini\n\nProsecutors in Rome are acting on a complaint by Carola Rackete accusing Mr Salvini of conducting a smear campaign against her German non-governmental organisation, Sea-Watch.\n\nThe prosecutors are requesting seizure of Mr Salvini's social media accounts. He is a prolific user of Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe lawsuit concerns Salvini phrases such as \"illegal and outlawed organisation\", \"pirate ship\", \"accomplices of smugglers and traffickers\", and \"delinquents\".\n\nMr Salvini hit back on Twitter, saying (in Italian): \"Denounced by a German communist, a trafficker of immigrants, who rammed a finance guards motor launch: a medal for me! I'll never give up.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Salvini poses for a selfie with a supporter in Taormina, Sicily\n\nItalian media report that by mid-May Mr Salvini had spent just 17 days at the interior ministry since the start of the year.\n\nA court in Locri meanwhile revoked the ban imposed on Riace mayor Domenico Lucano, famous throughout Italy for having welcomed migrants to his town.\n\nHe was put under house arrest and then expelled in October 2018, but now he can return to Riace.", "description": "One-third of the ministers are women in the most youthful government in the country's history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5909/production/_108639722_italygovtepa5sep19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
