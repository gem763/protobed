Cheering onlookers crowd behind metal barriers. Organizer Barry O\u2019Brien calls out the rules.\n\n\u201cYou must first throw the turnip before you reach me. Pick up the turnip and throw it again,\u201d he yells. \u201cReady. Steady. Go!\u201d\n\nThe final round of the 2019 World Championship Turnip Races has begun.\n\nRural Ireland is home to a growing proliferation of festivals, as a way to attract visitors to towns still struggling to recover from the country\u2019s recession a decade ago. Tourists and locals can have conversations with sound artists at the HearSay audio festival in Kilfinane, listen to traditional Irish music at F\u00e9ile na T\u00e1na in Carlingford and check out contemporary art in vacant shops turned galleries at K-FEST in Killorglin, all begun in the past six years. New this year is the Halloween-themed P\u00faca festival, including light shows at a 12th-century castle.\n\nBallydehob\u2019s turnip race is older, launched in the 1990s as part of a festival that includes a charades competition, a dog show and a procession of traditional wooden sailboats. The town added a bluegrass festival in 2017 and a \u201cSecret Song\u201d music festival, where patrons buy tickets without knowing who the acts will be, in 2015.\n\nBarry O'Brien, who organizes the turnip races, in front of his pub, the Irish Whip.

In 2010, new legislation lowered legal blood alcohol limits while driving and, in 2018, a mandatory driving ban was enacted for anyone caught with alcohol levels over the limits.\n\nWhen people do go out\u2014perhaps springing for a taxi to do so\u2014they want it to be special, says Joe O\u2019Leary, manager of Levis Corner House, a more than century-old pub on Ballydehob\u2019s main drag. People say, \u201cIt has to be a big event. You almost need something else to attract people.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Leary runs the town\u2019s jazz festival and started the newer music festivals.\n\nThe participants in the turnip race have to run about 250 yards up a hill on the main road of Ballydehob (population 274), hurling their vegetable projectiles underhand along the way. The first one to cross the finish line with turnip in hand wins.\n\nA contestant in the under 6 race, with his turnip.

In the turnip version, children run in their own rounds, divided by age. There\u2019s usually a women\u2019s race (though no women entered this year) and then a men\u2019s, run in heats. The contest ends with the men\u2019s final championship round. About 80 people ran this year.\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien, 71 years old, says the turnips he gets for the race from a local farmer are special. \u201cThey are as hard as flint,\u201d he says, and durable enough to stay intact after being repeatedly bounced off asphalt. The ones for this year\u2019s race were the size of coconuts.\n\nYears ago, one spectator landed in the hospital for two days after a wayward turnip hit her in the shin. \u201cIt burst a blood vessel,\u201d says Mr. O\u2019Brien, who owns a local pub, The Irish Whip. He noted one irony: \u201cShe was a vegetarian.\u201d Before the town began putting up the metal barriers to keep the crowd back from the road, some onlookers wore shin guards.\n\nOne year, about a decade ago, Mr. O\u2019Brien used onions instead when the turnip harvest was bad. \u201cThey were big Spanish onions, rock solid,\u201d he says. But midway through the various rounds, the outer skins began to peel off. \u201cFellows were coming back after winning with tears in their eyes,\u201d he says.\n\nMartin O\u2019Sullivan, 63, who was born in Ballydehob and won the race several years ago, has one tip: \u201cYou pick the roundest turnip you can.\u201d As for strategy, \u201cYou have to throw it straight up the middle of the road.\u201d\n\nThat is easier said than done. During the races last month, turnips veered right. They veered left. They bounced wildly and rolled under the metal barriers.\n\nIn the children\u2019s races, each of the roughly 10 contestants in the under 6 category blew past the finishing line and kept running up the street. One boy lost sight of his turnip, wandered backward and picked up someone else\u2019s. A girl in the under 8 round forgot to toss her turnip, clutching it closely while she ran.\n\nBarry O\u2019Brien gives World Champion Benedikt Martin his trophy. Mr. Martin ran the race barefoot.

Join the discussion below.\n\nBallydehob, with buildings painted in jaunty blues, pinks and yellows, attracted hippies and artists from around Europe in the 1970s. Now, it is home to the Michelin-starred Restaurant Chestnut and this year\u2019s Google Science Fair Grand Prize winner, 18-year-old Fionn Ferreira. Its Main Street is lined with quirky shops, pubs and restaurants. There are also several empty storefronts.\n\nIts turnip race is part of what appears to be a world-wide fascination with throwing food. There\u2019s the decades-old La Tomatina festival in Bu\u00f1ol, Spain, when thousands of people gather to throw tomatoes at each other. At the Battle of the Oranges in Ivrea, Italy, participants hurl citrus.\n\nBrockworth, England has an annual cheese-rolling festival where contestants chase an eight pound wheel of Double Gloucester down a steep hill. \u201cYou\u2019ll never catch the cheese. It is going 80 miles an hour,\u201d says Sara Stevens, the festival\u2019s organizer. The winner is the first one down the hill. The prize is the cheese.\n\nChildren run in their round of the turnip race. Contestants must throw their turnip, run after it, pick it up and throw it again.

And Denis O\u2019Brien, Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s 40-year-old son, comes in third, slowed down by a dramatic tumble near the end of the race.\n\n\u201cI went down to grab my turnip and I tripped,\u201d said the younger Mr. O\u2019Brien.\n\nWhile the World Championship title is a bit of hubris\u2014Mr. O\u2019Brien says he doesn\u2019t know of any other turnip races\u2014this is an international winner\u2019s circle. Mr. Martin is from Germany. Mr. Shaw is from Manchester, England. He and his family were on vacation in the area and were simply driving by when they saw the crowd. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why not\u2019? I used to play football,\u201d Mr. Shaw says.\n\nMr. Martin is modest about his win. \u201cI think it was luck,\u201d he says. Alas, he is too young to claim the grand prize: A pewter trophy filled with Irish whiskey.\n\nWrite to Andrea Petersen at andrea.petersen@wsj.com", "description": "Turnips are perfect for rolling and throwing.
