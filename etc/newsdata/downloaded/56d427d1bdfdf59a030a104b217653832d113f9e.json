Throwing back shots, sipping a beer or indulging in a Champagne-soaked brunch in this city-state technically remains illegal without a drinker holding a permit, though no bartender ever asks to see one before pouring a drink.\n\nDubai, pictured, has loosened its liquor laws to allow tourists to purchase alcohol in state-controlled stores\n\nDubai, home to the long-haul carrier Emirates, draws visitors from around the world to the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, as well as to resorts on beaches along the Persian Gulf.\n\nTourists wander through miles of air-conditioned malls, travel by SUVs into its rolling deserts and enjoy its many restaurants.\n\nMany also have a drink while here. The United Arab Emirates dominates other countries around the Middle East when it comes to drinking, with a per-capita alcohol consumption of 3.8 litres (1 gallon) per person per year, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThat's even with Sharjah, one of the UAE's seven emirates, banning alcohol.\n\nAlcohol means big business, especially for the state. There's a 50 per cent import tax on a bottle of alcohol, as well as an additional 30 per cent tax in Dubai on buying from liquor stores.\n\nDubai Duty Free, which is also government-owned, sold over $2 billion of goods last year alone to those passing through its airport terminals, including nine million cans of beer, three million whiskey bottles and 1.5 million bottles of wine. Duty-free sales, while limited, never required an alcohol licence.\n\nThe country's two major liquor store chains are Maritime and Mercantile International, a subsidiary of the government-owned Emirates airline, and African & Eastern. African & Eastern, which did not respond to a request for comment, is believed to be at least partially held by the state or affiliated firms.\n\nBars and nightclubs in Dubai are almost entirely limited to operating inside of or connected to hotels - even drink receipts at the Dubai International Airport show up as coming from a hotel attached to the airport.\n\nPeople enjoy alcoholic drinks at a restaurant overlooking Dubai's marina. Authorities have taken steps in recent years to loosen drinking regulations\n\nBut even with those restrictions, alcohol-serving establishments always seem full on Thursday nights, the start of the Emirati weekend.\n\nSlowly, however, that has begun to change. Lower global energy prices, a 30 per cent drop in Dubai's real estate market value and trade war fears have seen employers in the city-state shed jobs. Parking lots don't appear quite as full as they once were as sale signs plaster shop windows.\n\nThat downturn appears to have even extended to alcohol. Overall sales of alcohol dropped to 161.5 million litres (42.6 million gallons) in 2018, down from 163.7 million litres (43.2 million gallons) in 2017, according to market research firm Euromonitor.\n\nHowever, tourism helped keep retail prices high overall as some consumers also sought higher-priced liquors, it said.\n\n'Travel and tourism will continue to play an important role in the development of alcoholic drinks in the United Arab Emirates, at least until Expo 2020,' Euromonitor said, referring to Dubai's hosting of the world's fair next year.\n\n'After Expo 2020, sales will be more influenced by in-country demographics and dynamics.\n\n'The United Arab Emirates is facing tough challenges, as changes in both consumers' buying behaviour and demographics started to have an effect.'\n\nThe hereditarily ruled government's Dubai Media Office and the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing did not respond to requests for comment on the new licence programme.\n\nHowever, regarding tourists, authorities have taken steps in recent years to loosen drinking regulations.\n\nIn 2016, Dubai eased rules prohibiting day-time alcohol sales during the holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast from dawn to dusk and abstain from anything perceived as sinful behaviour.\n\nIn the next few years, the Islamic lunar calendar will draw Ramadan closer to early spring and winter months, a tourist-packed time in the city before the heat takes hold.\n\nIn Dubai, driving after consuming any amount of alcohol remains illegal as does drinking in public\n\nThe new procedure on alcohol permits allows tourists to obtain one for free at either African & Eastern or MMI stores after showing their passports and signing a pledge that they aren't Muslim and will follow local law.\n\nThe process finally ends the Catch-22 that tourists here found themselves in if they drank.\n\nLocal newspaper stories involving alcohol and mayhem routinely included police charging tourists for drinking without a licence when they wouldn't be able to legally register for one.\n\nMeanwhile, driving after consuming any amount of alcohol remains illegal as does drinking in public.\n\nRecently published guidelines say any alcohol purchased in stores can only be drunk 'within your hotel room/apartment.'\n\nA longtime critic of Dubai's legal system says the new laws can mislead tourists about the still-stringent laws on drinking.\n\nRadha Stirling of the for-hire advocacy group Detained in Dubai explained: 'What the new law does is create potential revenue through the granting of licences, and further mislead people into thinking that they can buy and consume alcohol without any risks.\n\n'But the same risks remain as before.'", "description": "The new laws let visitors to Dubai obtain liquor permits for the first time.
