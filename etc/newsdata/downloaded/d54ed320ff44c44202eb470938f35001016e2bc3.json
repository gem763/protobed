Now 22, Griego faces up to 120 years in prison or as little as probation and treatment.\n\nGriego pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and child abuse resulting in death in the January 2013 shootings of his family.\n\nProsecutors say he had methodically plotted the killings when he was 15.\n\nHis remaining sisters spoke before Judge Alisa Hart Tuesday, with one of then saying she moves often for fear her brother will find her.\n\n'My family and my parents deserve to be remembered for the incredible people they were and not for the lies that Nehemiah has created to justify his crimes against them,' said Annette Griego.\n\nNehemiah Griego, 22, murdered his parents, brother and two sisters in 2013 when he was 15\n\nHe will be resentenced Tuesday in state district court in Albuquerque and could face up to 120 years\n\nNehemiah shot his father Greg, his mother, Sarah, his nine-year-old brother, Zephania and sisters Jael, five , and Angelina, two, at their home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in January 2013\n\nAfter the shooting, Nehemiah told police he was planning to kill more people and wanted to die in a shootout with officers\n\nA judge decided in August that Griego would be sentenced as an adult after finding he wasn't amenable for treatment as a juvenile.\n\nGriego's lawyers say he had an abusive home life.\n\nThey also have said he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nWhen Griego was 15 he first shot his mother, Sarah, in her bed as she slept, then he woke up his brother Zephania to show the boy their mother's body before shooting him as well.\n\nGriego then walked into his sisters' bedroom and fatally shot five-year-old Jael and two-year-old Angelina.\n\nHours later, his father, Greg, returned home from his shift at a homeless shelter, and the teen \u2014 who had been waiting in a bathroom \u2014 ambushed him, authorities said.\n\nHe later told a deputy that he had anger issues and had been annoyed with his mother before carrying out the shootings, according to sheriff's documents.\n\nHe was taken into juvenile custody and was diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder but was told he would be released on his 21st birthday on March 20, 2018 under the state's laws.\n\nA judge decided in March not to let him out, however, after attorneys filed a last minute appeal of his juvenile sentencing.\n\nIn December, a judge determined that he has not been rehabilitated during the last five years, he will be sentenced as an adult and faces a maximum of 120 years behind bars.\n\nHis attorneys have maintained in his defense that he had been abused at home and likely suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of beatings at the hands of his father, who was a gang member-turned-pastor.\n\nNehemiah Griego, 22, is shown in a recent mugshot. He has been in jail since January 2013 for killing five members of his family but may be released in days\n\nProsecutors had argued for Griego to be sentenced as an adult and sent to state prison after he pleaded guilty, saying that the crime was premeditated and that he has not expressed remorse for it. Pato again made those two points in her filing Monday.\n\nShe also said Griego's older sisters, Vanessa Lightbourne and Annette Verreault, remained in fear for their safety based on his past acts and statements.\n\nBoth told state police that they had been aware of reported threats made by their younger brother, but that neither of them had been threatened directly.\n\nThey did not testify at a hearing two years ago where Griego was found to have made progress toward rehabilitation.\n\nGriego told investigators that he had learned to work through his emotions. He had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, but he said he no longer takes medication for either.\n\nHe planned to continue therapy after his release, he said.\n\n'He told me there is nobody out there that is worth his time and that he does not want to start his time over, that it is pointless to start over [in prison],' wrote State Police Agent Marcus Lopez.", "description": "Nehemiah Griego, 22, murdered his parents, brother and two sisters in 2013 and will be resentenced as an adult Tuesday.
