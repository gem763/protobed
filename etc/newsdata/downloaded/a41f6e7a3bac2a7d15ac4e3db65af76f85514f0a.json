The book is like a spy novel because he gets on the wrong side of Putin. It's total chaos. What resonated with me was that Bill's fund was up eight times and then down 90% and then up 12 times. It's good to have a strong stomach and not get complacent about stocks and markets. It definitely will keep you on your toes.\"\n\nBuy it here.", "description": "Looking for a new book?
