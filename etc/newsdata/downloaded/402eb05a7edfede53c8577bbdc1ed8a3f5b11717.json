Which, given that she\u2019s now 69, is wonderfully encouraging for the rest of us.\n\nBut leather jumpsuits are not without their challenges and, according to Suzi\u2019s extremely twinkly husband, Rainer Haas, the main problem is getting them off. \u2018They get so sweaty, I have to peel her out at the end of each concert,\u2019 he says in his husky German accent. \u2018And this is sometimes not always so easy.\u2019\n\nOr terribly dignified. Because, as Suzi points out: \u2018Of course you can\u2019t wear anything underneath. So afterwards, you just turn them inside out and hang them out to dry and well . . .\u2019\n\nIt is 46 years and 55 million records since Suzi stormed onto Top Of The Pops with her song Can The Can and changed the face of rock music, Suzi is still touring\n\n\u2018Disinfectant!\u2019 cries Rainer. \u2018You need disinfectant and to give them a Polish shower! [the term for spraying them with perfume]. Ha, ha, ha! And then let them dry.\u2019\n\nHe should know. While his contemporaries are playing golf, birdwatching or just sipping gin and tonics in their conservatories, Rainer, a former concert promoter, is still involved in this leathery tussle on a regular basis.\n\nSuited and booted: Suzi with a stuffed leopard in 1973\n\nBecause amazingly, 46 years and 55 million records after she stormed onto Top Of The Pops with her song Can The Can and changed the face of rock music, Suzi is still touring. Night after night, in cities all round the world, she stomps about on stage \u2014 singing, yelling, swearing, thumping away on an electric bass almost as big as her and driving men (and quite a few women) of a certain age wild. \u2018She\u2019s jumping about for two hours in the leather, in the hot lights with her heavy bass,\u2019 says Rainer, proudly. \u2018But most of the audience can\u2019t even stand up properly any more!\u2019\n\nWe meet part-way through what surely must be her millionth tour \u2014 she has squeezed me in between the German and Australian legs \u2014 just as a documentary about her rock \u2019n\u2019 roll life, Suzi Q, is released.\n\nAt first it\u2019s a bit disappointing to find she doesn\u2019t look anything like an ageing hellcat \u2014 teeny-weeny with size-three feet, artfully shaggy hair, plump skin, perfect teeth and far more concerned about her cream carpets \u2014 \u2018Shoes off, shoes off, no exceptions!\u2019 \u2014 than anything else. \u2018I am very particular about my carpets,\u2019 she says. \u2018They\u2019re really nice carpets.\u2019\n\nTurns out there are two Suzis. One is this obsessively tidy granny (yes, really!) who likes nothing more than a game of Scrabble, a glass of fine wine, the sound of the vacuum and the smell of polish being rubbed liberally into her centuries-old wood-panelling by her housekeeper Alison.\n\nThe other is her rock chick alter ego. \u2018As soon as I zip up the suit, I\u2019m gone and the other Suzi\u2019s there!\u2019 she cries.\n\n\u2018And the minute I come off stage, I can feel her leaving me. Once, when I was being filmed, I could actually see her go.\u2019\n\nSo, presumably, it was the stage Suzi who once shot pal Alice Cooper in the face with a dart gun. And deliberately smashed her bass into the face of a fan doing unsavoury things with his tongue at her during a concert.\n\nPoster for Suzi Q with the title: 'The Queen has come to claim her crown' (left). Suzi with her guitar dressed head to toe in leather (right)\n\nWhile one Suzi is an obsessively tidy Granny the other is her rock chick alter ego. \u2018As soon as I zip up the suit, I\u2019m gone and the other Suzi\u2019s there!\u2019 she cries (pictured in her younger years)\n\nAnd who played on despite a broken arm at a concert in Australia, is best friends with Iggy Pop and Debbie Harry and fought back at all the men who couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to her Rear of the Year (she won the competition in 1982). \u2018I\u2019ve kneed men in the balls,\u2019 she grins. \u2018I\u2019ve punched and I\u2019ve also slapped a few men, very hard.\u2019\n\nOne of the few times she was rendered speechless was at a Prince\u2019s Trust event in the mid-Eighties when Prince Charles told her she had \u2018the best legs since Tina Turner\u2019.\n\n\u2018I just stood there with my mouth hanging open. I just didn\u2019t expect Prince Charles to say that\u2019, she says. \u2018I didn\u2019t even say thank you! He caught me completely off guard.\u2019\n\nSuzi Quatro wearing a neckerchief and leather jacket at the Festival Hall Melbourne in 1974\n\nElvis had also left her speechless when, in 1974, he called to compliment her on her version of All Shook Up and invited her to his home, Graceland.\n\nShe replied tartly: \u2018No, thank you. I\u2019m very busy.\u2019\n\nBritish guitarist Len Tuckey, Suzi's first husband, on their wedding day in December 1976\n\n\u2018How dumb could you be?\u2019 she says today, slapping her forehead. \u2018But he was my hero and I wasn\u2019t quite ready to meet him. I wanted to be on a more equal plane. I didn\u2019t know there wouldn\u2019t be another chance!\u2019\n\nNo wonder her life has just been made into a documentary. It\u2019s a huge story of grit, determination and relentless focus.\n\nHow a teeny girl from a musical family in Detroit pursued her dream to be a rock star with a single-mindedness that left her four ambitious sisters, parents, first husband (British guitarist Len Tuckey) \u2014 and, occasionally, their two children \u2014 trailing in her wake.\n\n\u2018I realised from a very young age that I didn\u2019t fit with the rest of my family. I was different. The loner. The odd one out \u2014 maybe I\u2019m not even their kid!\u2019 she jokes. \u2018So I concentrated on finding my voice. On being the one-off person that I am. And I am a one-off!\u2019\n\nShe found her path when she saw Elvis on TV when she was six. \u2018I just wanted to be him and it didn\u2019t occur to me that I couldn\u2019t be. From then on, that was my purpose. My point.\u2019\n\nSuzi at her Essex manor houe with her bass and collection of guitars. When Elvis invited her to his home in Graceland in 1974 she replied tartly: \u2018No, thank you. I\u2019m very busy'\n\nSo when her elder sister suggested they form an all-girl band, she jumped at it and taught herself the bass guitar.\n\nThe Pleasure Seekers took off immediately. They were soon touring and 14-year-old Suzi was the star of the show.\n\nAs such, when their success waned, she was the one plucked out for a recording deal in London while, at home, resentment festered.\n\nWhen Suiz's older sister suggested they form an all-girl band, she jumped at it and taught herself the bass guitar\n\n\u2018Nothing could hold me back,\u2019 she says. \u2018I am the least selfish person you could imagine. But I had a purpose and I had a path and nothing could stop me from following it.\u2019 The first two years were hard and lonely \u2014 she knew no one and lived alone in a bedsit writing songs her new producer Mickie Most hated.\n\nSuccess finally came in 1973, after her first snarling appearance on Top Of The Pops in platform boots and what were to become her signature leathers.\n\nShe allowed herself just 24 hours to go bonkers before coming back down to earth and getting back to work.\n\nAmerican sitcom Happy Days with Suzi Quatro as bass player Leather Tuscadero pictured with Henry Winkler as Fonzie\n\nFor while onstage she was ballsy, outspoken in interviews, an angry, sneering wild woman of rock and very, very sexy, off-stage she was almost shockingly calm. \u2018I call her the \u201cmild woman of rock\u201d,\u2019 says husband Rainer.\n\nEven back in the day, there were hardly any drugs \u2014 \u2018I smoked marijuana as a teenager but it sped me up \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stop talking!\u2019 \u2014 no orgies with groupies, despite plenty of propositions \u2018from both sexes\u2019 and the odd sweaty jockstrap hurled on stage.\n\n\u2018Some people want [me] to be the rock legend off stage as well and that\u2019s dangerous. Dangerous and unhealthy,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I am my mother\u2019s daughter and she was very religious. I never allowed any of that crazy behaviour to come into my sphere.\u2019\n\nWhat, not even the occasional drug-fuelled bender, or a TV or two hurled out of the window?\n\n\u2018I am quite square. I have Catholic guilt. I believe in fidelity and I had a partner in the band,\u2019 she says firmly. \u2018I met Len in the band and he and I were in love in two weeks. I was aware of temptation, I never got into a situation where anything might be out of hand.\n\n\u2018I was very strict about that. So if a party looked crazy, we were gone off home to bed.\u2019\n\nNothing has changed. Housekeeper Alison \u2014 who clearly adores her \u2014 has been working for her for decades. \u2018I was expecting excitement. I said to my husband: \u201cOh God, it\u2019s going to be crazy parties!\u201d But nothing. Just endless juicing. I was so disappointed. She has never been wild at home, ever.\u2019\n\nSuzi did (just once) wreck a hotel room in Melbourne, at the end of an eight-month tour. But instead of it happening at some crazy party, she planned it \u2014 \u2018It\u2019s not very rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, but I do like to plan things,\u2019 she says.\n\nShe carefully selected feather pillows from her room to make the most mess when she sliced them open with a knife, then blew up the TV \u2014 \u2018you just pour water in when it\u2019s plugged in and that does it.\u2019\n\nAnd there was a Christmas party here at the manor a couple of years ago, but instead of vodka shots, guests were greeted with a stern notice from the hostess: \u2018Shoes off, or f*** off.\u2019\n\nSuzi always has to be in charge. So she proposed to both husbands within weeks of meeting them \u2014 in 1973 and 1993 respectively. \u2018If I want to marry you, I ask,\u2019 she explains firmly. \u2018I had 25 marriage proposals, but the answer was always no, because they asked. I wanna be in charge, so I ask.\u2019\n\nEqually when, after five years of trying, she and Len finally had their children, Laura and Richard, she insisted on taking them on the road until they were old enough for school. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t give up my life to join theirs, so we were all doing it together\u2019, she said.\n\nThe Pleasure Seekers took off immediately. They were soon touring and 14-year-old Suzi was the star of the show\n\nHowever hard she tried to separate the two Suzis, it can\u2019t always have been easy being the offspring of someone so energetic, so driven and focused and so lusted after.\n\nParticularly when her star began to fade after a string of hits in just seven years, instead of sitting back and enjoying the spoils, Suzi was obsessively adapting and changing tack \u2014 doing anything to keep her name in lights.\n\nThere were three years as bass player Leather Tuscadero, on TV\u2019s Happy Days. She starred in Annie Get Your Gun in the West End, did panto, was on numerous TV panel shows and even Midsomer Murders (as a rock diva electrocuted on stage) \u2014 while all the time writing music, poetry and books. \u2018My biggest priority in life is creation \u2014 always moving forward,\u2019 she says. \u2018And my biggest achievement is keeping my feet on the ground.\u2019\n\nThough of course, there\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018rock star normal\u2019.\n\nSo, naturally, Suzi has a tendency to refer to herself in the third person and mention \u2014 quite a few times \u2014 what a \u2018one-off\u2019 she is and admits she adores being famous and recognised. But she is also warm, funny, sweary, has astonishingly muscly arms (and I feel them) from all that bass playing, and is very good company.\n\nNot least when Rainer\u2019s about. \u2018He says he\u2019s a lion-tamer and I\u2019m the lion,\u2019 she says, and explains that, soon after they married, he told her he had to be the man in the relationship or it wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nHe interjects. \u2018From first kiss to being married was three months. People gave us six months. She tries to be bossy, but I\u2019m her husband, not her fan.\u2019\n\nAt first it\u2019s a bit disappointing to find she doesn\u2019t look anything like an ageing hellcat \u2014 teeny-weeny with size-three feet, artfully shaggy hair, plump skin, perfect teeth (Suzi pictured at home with Jane Fryer)\n\nSuzi and Rainer have been married for 26 years, but have never lived together. Perhaps that\u2019s the secret. The manor house \u2014 which is full of gold discs, awards and photos of Suzi \u2014 is her home. His is in Hamburg while they have a house in Majorca that she calls their \u2018mutual space\u2019.\n\nSo he is just visiting today. They laugh and joke and are wonderfully glinty with each other \u2014 to the extent that, when I mention her age, he giggles: \u2018That\u2019s not an age, that\u2019s a position . . .\u2019 and she shrieks \u2014 \u2018Rainer!\u2019 \u2014 but clearly doesn\u2019t give a fig.\n\nShe\u2019s far too busy finishing off her next album with KT Tunstall, planning the one after that \u2014 she will write it with her son in the new studio she\u2019s just had built in the garden \u2014 and working on the screenplay of her life story. \u2018Miley Cyrus has been mentioned [to play her] but it\u2019s hard because of course I\u2019m a one-off,\u2019 she says, again.\n\nIn the meantime, she\u2019s back on stage next week playing to sell-out audiences in Australia.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not ready to stop and why should I?\u2019 she says.\n\nWhy indeed? Particularly if her handsome Rainer will be hovering in the wings, ready to strip her of her sweaty leathers and join her afterwards for a soothing game of Scrabble.\n\nSuzi Q is in selected cinemas until December, or available on DVD.
