If I had a dollar for every time I told my family\u2019s dogs that a certain food is \u201cnot for puppies,\u201d I would have enough money to buy a whole other dog.\n\nA really big one.\n\nBut no matter how many times I say it, they\u2019re always sticking their nose into my food. I almost guarantee that if my brother\u2019s staghound puppy Freya was given the option between a delectable feast of her favourite snack (salmon skins) and an unidentifiable glob of gooey grossness, she\u2019d probs still give the goo a go just out of pure curiosity.\n\nWHY MUST THEY OPT FOR THE GOO?\n\nme, at the dogs, constantly.\n\nSo it\u2019s good that there are business folk who see that the puppy culinary market is ready for a shake-up. Take dog snack proprietors Thea Mendes and her son Marcus. They\u2019ve whipped up some snacks that puppies would absolutely turn down goo for.\n\nThe weirdest part is that instead of the dogs clamouring to get a cheeky bite of whatever I\u2019M eating, I\u2019m more interested in what they\u2019ve got. Because the business that Thea and Marcus run, is all about donuts. And I love donuts.\n\nBut the donuts on the market at DOMUTS are a little bit different. Instead of a lovely caramel glaze (not for puppies) or jam-filled centre (not for puppies), they\u2019re like tennis balls (yes for puppies!).\n\n[SHORTCODE HERE]\n\nit\u2019s a puppy party!\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only option on offer, because the Mendes family was given some serious backing from CGU Insurance to take their business and their ambitions to the next level, after essentially having to fold in the early stages. According to Thea herself:\n\n\u201cAs part of the backing I have received to relaunch DOMUTS from CGU, they provided me with advice to rebrand the business. We held a brainstorm to think about the names for the range based on the things dogs love to eat. We then decided on Chewy Tennis Ball, Crunchy Stick, and Tasty Homework.\u201d\n\nokay but now I want one\n\nWondering how the heck they came up with varieties like tennis ball? You aren\u2019t alone.\n\n\u201cMarcus and I researched the ingredients that were safe for dogs to eat, CGU put us in touch with a food technologist and we also consulted with local vets,\u201d said Thea. \u201cFor example, one of the vets we spoke to told us to make the DOMUTS crunchy as that would be better for dog\u2019s teeth.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019re suitable for dogs of all shapes and sizes. Sure, it takes a chihuahua a little longer to finish the DOMUT than it would a Great Dane, but they\u2019re yummy for all.\n\nAnd now I want a donut.\n\nIgnite your ambition today and apply for a CGU Insurance Ambition Grant HERE.\n\nCGU Insuring Ambition.", "description": "If I had a dollar for every time I told my family's dogs that a certain food is \"not for puppies,\" I would have enough money to buy a whole other pup.", "authors": ["Steph Panecasio"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/08/AW-YEAH-DOG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
