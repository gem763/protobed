The move drew criticism from industry rivals but paid off last year when the company made its first operating profit in more than a decade.\n\nPemsel also brings expertise in TV advertising from a former marketing role at broadcaster ITV Plc., said Julian Aquilina of industry consultants Enders Analysis.\n\n\"He understands the value of content, and it's impressive that the Guardian has in three years attracted over 1 million readers to financially support it,\" he said. \"His background proves he understands the media markets.\"\n\nThe Premier League plans to split the leadership between the new CEO and a new chairman to be appointed later.", "description": "Shareholders voted unanimously to appoint David Pemsel as CEO of the Premier League.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/76a070102f334f2e86197446a7f50087_18.jpg"}
