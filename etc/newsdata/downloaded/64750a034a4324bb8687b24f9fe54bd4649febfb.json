Get a better candidate this time, you'll need it!\" he tweeted.\n\n(According to the Federal Election Commission and the Electoral College, Trump actually ended up with 304 electoral votes and Hillary Clinton with 227.)\n\nThe committee chairmen \u2014 Schiff; Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the Oversight Committee; and Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y., chairman of the foreign affairs panel \u2014 say they will issue the subpoena Friday, unless the White House complies with their request, which they say was made more than three weeks ago.\n\nAmong other call-related documents, the chairmen are seeking any records referring to the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and his communication with Ukraine.\n\nThe Democratic leaders have already subpoenaed Giuliani as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said he was on the phone call.\n\nSchiff said he was very concerned about Pompeo's \"efforts to potentially interfere\" in the panel's efforts to obtain documents and testimony from witnesses. After Pompeo raised concerns about lawmakers' requests on Tuesday, Democrats pushed back the first of their series of planned depositions.\n\nSchiff said Wednesday that said any attempt by Pompeo, the president or anyone else to interfere would be considered evidence of obstruction.\n\nTrump zeroed in on a New York Times report that Schiff had learned in advance about the whistleblower complaint over the Ukraine call and the president's alleged abuse of power.\n\n\"I think it's a scandal that he knew before, and I'll go a step further, he probably helped write it,\" Trump said without any evidence.\n\nPelosi made the point that House Democrats were continuing to work on two legislative priorities \u2014 lowering prescription drug prices and a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico.\n\nShe insisted that the legislative efforts were separate from the impeachment probe and that Democrats were still ready to work with the president. As far as the president's attitude about cooperating on legislation, \"that's really up to him,\" she said.", "description": "House Democrats threatened the White House with a subpoena, saying it has refused their requests to voluntarily produce key documents as part of their impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Brian Naylor", "Jessica Taylor"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/02/ap_19275552546063_wide-d45a2fc6539f4517db6db23ae37f10ec857cdb89.jpg?s=1400"}
