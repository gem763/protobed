Ilhan Omar: Trump is welcome in Minnesota, but not his 'campaign of lies and bigotry'", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Ilhan Omar said Thursday that President Trump is welcome to hold a campaign rally next month in her hometown of Minneapolis \u2014 provided he leaves his \u201clies and bigotry\u201d behind.\n\nMs. Omar, Minnesota Democrat, made the remark on Twitter after Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign announced plans this week to hold a rally in the city on Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cOur beautiful state welcomes everyone with open arms,\u201d Mr. Omar tweeted. \u201cBut to be clear: we will continue to reject you and your campaign of lies and bigotry.\u201d\n\nMs. Omar, a former Somali refugee and naturalized U.S. citizen, has found herself repeatedly on the receiving end of attacks from Mr. Trump in recent months that the president\u2019s critics have condemned as racist. Mr. Trump said in July that Ms. Omar and other congresswomen of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries from where they came, and last week he falsely claimed on Twitter that she was partying during the recent anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign announced earlier Thursday that he will hold a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rally at the Target Center, an arena in downtown Minneapolis capable of holding nearly 20,000 people.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s electoral college votes have been awarded exclusively to Democratic presidential candidates dating back to 1972, though Mr. Trump, a Republican, came close to winning the state in 2016.\n\n\u201cPlacing this in Minneapolis at the Target Center, a venue with a significantly larger capacity than past rallies when he\u2019s come into the state, indicates how optimistic the reelection team is, the president is and the Republican Party of Minnesota about our opportunities to flip this state\u2019s 10 electoral votes on Nov. 3 of 2020,\u201d said Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan, Minnesota Public Radio reported.\n\nMs. Omar is hardly the only Minnesota Democrat wary of the event, however.\n\n\u201cUnder ordinary circumstances, it would be an honor to welcome a sitting president of the United States to Minneapolis and to showcase all our city has to offer on the national stage,\u201d Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement Thursday. \u201cBut these aren\u2019t ordinary circumstances. Since taking office President Trump\u2019s actions have been reprehensible and his rhetoric has made it clear that he does not value the perspectives or rights of Minneapolis\u2019 diverse communities.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no legal mechanism to prevent the president from visiting, his message of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis,\u201d Mr. Frey added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
