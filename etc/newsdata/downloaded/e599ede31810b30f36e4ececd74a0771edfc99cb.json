In exchange for receiving these grants, project developers must commit to list and transact their resulting credits on the AirCarbon Exchange.\n\nThe new exchange is a collaboration venture with the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), and supported by Enterprise Singapore.\n\nEdwin Khew, SEAS chairman as well as AirCarbon\u2019s chairman and co-founder, said: \u201cWe aim to make the AirCarbon token the easiest and most streamlined instrument for the trading of CORSIA EEUs globally.\u201d\n\nThis will be the world\u2019s first global blockchain-enabled, multi-stakeholder carbon trading hub, representing carbon trades worth more than US$100 billion, said Mr Khew.\n\nIn setting up the exchange, there had been partnerships and discussions with industry stakeholders which include airlines, green project developers, sustainable technology providers, multilateral institutions, impact investors and regulators, Mr Khew added.\n\nSatvinder Singh, assistant chief executive officer of Enterprise Singapore, noted that international regulations and the increased focus on sustainability will lead to greater demand for carbon offsetting activities globally.\n\n\u201cEnterprise Singapore stands ready to support solutions providers like AirCarbon to grow in Singapore and address the needs of corporates to offset their carbon emissions, starting from the aviation industry,\u201d Mr Singh said.\n\nThe CORSIA regime is a market-based mechanism set up to offset commercial aviation\u2019s growing carbon footprint. The industry accounts for over 2.5 per cent of total CO2 emissions, AirCarbon said.\n\nUK-based First Derivatives designed the front-end trading solution to power the exchange.\n\nAirCarbon also operates the AirCarbon Fund, an investment fund which invests in carbon-mitigating projects such as reforestation, methane capture and carbon emissions reduction. Through these projects, the fund also generates CORSIA-compliant tradable carbon offsets, which are then listed on the exchange.\n\nFintech and financial services group RHT Holdings is an investor in AirCarbon, an RHT spokesman told The Business Times. Jayaprakash Jagateesan, chief executive of RHT Holdings, is an AirCarbon board director. He wrote earlier this month that Singapore businesses need to get creative in reducing their carbon footprint and helping to mitigate climate change.\n\nSenior Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Koh Poh Koon, minted the new exchange\u2019s first AirCarbon digital token at its launch during the Asia Clean Energy Summit 2019, which is part of the Singapore International Energy Week 2019 held at Marina Bay Sands.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Energy & Commodities - A GLOBAL blockchain-based carbon exchange was launched on Wednesday, offering a marketplace for stakeholders in the transportation industry to trade securitised carbon emissions. .
