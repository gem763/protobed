In an Instagram Story video on Tuesday, the \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d star was seen getting her hair done while singing along to the Fugees song \u201cReady or Not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can do what you do ... believe me,\u201d Rodriguez rhymes along with Lauryn Hill\u2019s lyrics. But instead of pausing while Hill says \u201cnigga,\u201d which is expected of non-Black hip-hop fans, Rodriguez goes for it.\n\n\u201cNiggas give me heebie-jeebies,\u201d the non-Black Latina raps, skipping one word and jumping straight to the slur. She giggles at the end of the line.\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing funny \u2014 or excusable \u2014 about the star\u2019s track record of anti-Black actions and history of gaslighting the Black community. While Rodriguez has been outspoken about the need for more diversity in Hollywood, even referencing the influence of Black characters in her own search for representation, she\u2019s separated herself from efforts that embody true inclusion. Her anti-Black attitude has excluded actors who diverge from the typical Hollywood Latinx look. When people seek to hold her accountable, she apologizes, but makes no good-faith effort to learn or stay in her lane. Her attempts to make good with the Black community \u2014 without any intent to repair the damage done \u2014 is a gaslighting tactic she\u2019s found supportive for her career.\n\n\n\nAfter the Instagram video went viral, Rodriguez offered a seemingly disingenuous video apology. \u201cI am sorry. I am sorry if I offended anyone by singing along to The Fugees, to a song I love, that I grew up on,\u201d she said. \u201cI love Lauryn Hill and I really am sorry if I offended you.\u201d While she rapped the lyric with ease, she didn\u2019t specifically direct her apology toward Black people \u2014 those who have ownership over its use and would take offense to her using the word. She also didn\u2019t explain why she, a non-Black woman, felt entitled to use it.\n\nRodriguez later offered another apology via a Notes app message posted on her Instagram feed. \u201cIn song or in real life, the words that I spoke, should not have been spoken. ... I thoughtlessly sang along to the lyrics of a favorite song, and even worse, I posted it. The word I sang, carries with it a legacy of hurt and pain that I cannot even imagine,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWatching my own video playing back at me, has shaken me to my core. It is humiliating that this has to be a public lesson but it is indeed a much deserved lesson.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, Rodriguez is no stranger to this education. In a September 2018 interview with her \u201cSmallfoot\u201d co-star Yara Shahidi, Rodriguez interrupted the interviewer, who was discussing Shahidi\u2019s status as a role model for other young Black women, to say that Shahidi is an inspiration to \u201cso many women,\u201d not just Black women \u2014 minimizing Shahidi\u2019s race. While Rodriguez emerged in this industry championing diversity, it\u2019s clear that she prefers diverse narratives and roles that align with her own identity, rather than overall diversity.\n\nShe favors white and mestizo (or mixed) representation in Latinx roles, at the expense of Black actors. When promotion for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d began in 2017, Rodriguez tweeted, \u201cMarvel and DC are killing it in inclusion and women, but where are the Latinos?! Asking for a friend\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNot only did she call into question the significance of the first superhero movie featuring Black actors in all the leading roles, she ignored the two Afro Latinas who have starred in Marvel films: Tessa Thompson, who played Valkyrie in \u201cThor\u201d and Zoe Saldana in \u201cGuardians of The Galaxy.\u201d Both also appeared in 2019\u2032s box-office hit \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d (Rodriguez has also not publicly recognized the groundbreaking character of Miles Morales, the Afro Latino Spider-Man in the award-winning \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\u201d)\n\n\n\nRodriguez\u2019s erasure of Black people, specifically Black women, first fell under digital scrutiny when she hosted a brunch celebrating Latinas in Hollywood with only one Afro Latina, Rosario Dawson, in attendance. When she was asked about the incident, Rodriguez asked Black Latinas to educate her about Afro Latinas in Hollywood who she should invite to her next gathering. It\u2019s hard to believe she didn\u2019t already have access to this information, and her erasure and dismissal of Blackness was clear.\n\n\n\nDuring a taped roundtable discussion about pay equity and diversity in television in November 2018, where she appeared alongside with Gabrielle Union, Ellen Pompeo and Emma Roberts, Rodriguez inaccurately said Latinas are paid the least in Hollywood.\n\nAnd on a subsequent appearance on the radio show \u201cSway in the Morning,\u201d she described social media backlash after the roundtable as \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Black community was the only community that I looked towards growing up. We didn\u2019t have many Latino shows, and the Black community made me feel like I was seen,\u201d Rodriguez said, adding, through tears, \u201cMy father is dark-skinned, he\u2019s Afro Latino ... If anything, the Black community is my community.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Photos surfaced of her father, who would not be considered Black Latino. Rodriguez had referred to herself as Afro Latina in the past, which she\u2019s since stopped doing.)\n\n\n\nYet again, she offered an apology on Sway\u2019s show.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I have hurt you, I am sorry and I will always be sorry, but you have to know that, until you know my heart, there\u2019s no way that we can live off clickbait, you guys,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cYou are allowed to feel pain and I empathize with your pain, and I\u2019m sorry if I caused your pain because it is the last thing I want to do.\u201d\n\nWhile one might argue that Rodriguez\u2019s proximity to Blackness through her upbringing might have once let her believe she had license to sing along to \u201cnigga,\u201d in 2019, there\u2019s no excuse. She repeatedly makes very public slip ups, is called to task, and apologizes. Months later, she\u2019s trending for another instance of erasure or anti-Blackness.\n\nIf we follow current patterns, this won\u2019t be the last \u201capology\u201d Rodriguez offers.", "description": "The Latina actor has frequently found herself in hot water for statements she's made about the Black community.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da872be2000000210505f9f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
