All but one survived the inferno; the cause of the blaze has yet to be determined.\n\nBoats like the Conception, which caught fire around 3am on 2 September and sank off the coast of Santa Barbara, are required to have a crew member keep watch at night. Federal authorities are conducting a criminal investigation into the deadly fire and could bring charges under a statute known as seaman\u2019s manslaughter.\n\nFive crew members, including the captain, managed to escape by jumping overboard but dozens trapped in the boat\u2019s bunkroom are believed to have died of smoke inhalation.\n\nThe disaster was the worst in California\u2019s recent maritime history and sent shockwaves through the diving community and across the state. The remains of the final victim still unaccounted for were recovered on Wednesday.\n\nThe victims included a family of five, a girl celebrating her 17th birthday with her parents and a friend, and a 26-year-old crewmember who was thrilled by her recent promotion to deckhand. Others included the marine biologist who led the three-day tour and couples who shared a love of the water. So far nine victims have been officially identified, ranging in age from 25 to 62.\n\nCalifornia boat fire: names of nine victims released at end of tragic week Read more\n\nThe report comes as investigators seek to determine the cause and try to recover the wreckage of the Conception from the bottom of the sea amid an ongoing criminal investigation conducted by the FBI, Coast Guard and the US attorney\u2019s office.\n\nThe NTSB says one of the crewmembers on the upper deck awoke to a noise and saw flames rising from the middle deck. He alerted the rest of the crew as the captain issued a panicked mayday call to the Coast Guard.\n\nThe crew, finding the ladder to the main deck on fire, jumped down \u2013 with one breaking a leg in the process. They tried to reach the others through a window but couldn\u2019t open it. They were forced to jump overboard when they became \u201coverwhelmed by smoke\u201d.\n\nThe captain and two crewmembers swam to the vessel\u2019s stern and reboarded the boat, according to the report. They opened the engine room\u2019s hatch but didn\u2019t find any fire. With other access routes blocked, they launched the boat\u2019s skiff, picked up the other two crewmembers and went to a nearby vessel.\n\nOnce onboard, the captain continued to send mayday calls as two crewmembers returned to the Conception to search for survivors near the burning wreckage.\n\nThere were none.\n\nAs crews work to recover the wreckage of the burned-out Conception from the bottom of the sea, the Coast Guard has issued additional safety recommendations in the wake of the tragedy, such as limiting the unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and the use of power strips and extension cords.\n\nThe recommendations also suggest owners and operators of vessels review emergency duties with the crew, identify emergency escapes, check all firefighting and lifesaving equipment onboard, and look at the condition of passenger accommodation spaces for \u201cunsafe practices or other hazardous arrangements\u201d.\n\nCoast Guard records show the Conception passed its two most recent inspections with no safety violations. Previous customers said the company that owns the vessel, Truth Aquatics, and the captains of its three boats, were very safety conscious.\n\nTruth Aquatics filed a lawsuit last week in US district court under a pre-civil war provision of maritime law that allows it to limit its liability.", "description": "Boats like the Conception, which caught fire and sank this month, are required to have a crew member keep watch at night", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbc2b34bdccb7bd392ba1b2e857da266a8519d54/0_64_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a8b7db23a5422cdd68cd8493474bed6"}
