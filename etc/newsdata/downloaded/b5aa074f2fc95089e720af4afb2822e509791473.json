Penney is nearing its death: top retail strategist", "language": "en", "text": "The Grim Reaper\u2019s sickle is about to run roughshod at J.C. Penney (JCP), suggests one veteran retail analyst.\n\n\u201cFor J.C. Penney, it\u2019s too little too late unfortunately,\u201d said SW Retail Advisors President Stacey Widlitz. \u201cI anticipate a significant wave of store closures \u2014 it\u2019s a tough one [J.C. Penney] to salvage.\u201d\n\nHard to argue with Widlitz\u2019s logic.\n\nMr,. Market says J.C. Penney is knocking on death\u2019s door even if it miraculously has a good holiday shopping season. J.C. Penney\u2019s stock is down 25% year-to-date, hovering around a mere 78 cents a share as of Friday. Nothing in J.C. Penney\u2019s financials up to this point suggest a good holiday season is forthcoming.\n\nActually, the complete opposite.\n\nJ.C. Penney\u2019s second quarter same-store sales crashed 9% as it continued to struggle with getting warm bodies into its stores (and online). The company lost $48 million in the quarter.\n\nAshopper heads into a J.C. Penney store in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) More\n\nSo far this year, J.C. Penney has seen a free cash flow outflow of $133 million. The company has racked up $202 million in net losses over that same stretch.\n\nInvestors are still awaiting a clear turnaround plan from J.C. Penney CEO Jill Soltau, who took over in October 2018. Now coming up on her one year anniversary, the veteran retail executive has been assessing J.C. Penney\u2019s store base and overall operations in an effort to save the retailer. Soltau has also been building out her executive team.\n\nPart of that turnaround may reportedly include restructuring some $4 billion in debt coming due in the next few years.\n\nSoltau at least knows she has a ton of work ahead of her to save the company.\n\n\u201cWe must also earn the confidence of our investors and other key stakeholders, so that they know we are riding the business and generating returns,\u201d Soltau told analysts in a mid-August earnings call.\n\nBut if Widlitz is right, Soltau\u2019s efforts may be too little, too late.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
