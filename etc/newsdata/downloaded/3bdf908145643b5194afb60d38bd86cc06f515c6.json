Kelly's federal case in Chicago", "language": "en", "text": "CHICAGO (AP) - A judge Wednesday set an April 27 trial date in R. Kelly\u2019s federal case in Chicago that accuses the R&B; star of child pornography and obstruction of justice.\n\nBut Judge Harry Leinenweber left open the possibility of changing the date later after Kelly attorney Steve Greenberg said having to prepare for trials in three other districts meant the defense may not be ready by April.\n\nIn all, Kelly faces 40 counts of state and federal sexual misconduct charges in Illinois, Minnesota and New York, from sexual assault to heading a racketeering scheme aimed at finding girls for Kelly.\n\nGreenberg told the judge Kelly\u2019s legal team had \u201climited resources\u201d and \u201cvoluminous\u201d potential evidence from four cases to wade through, saying a single disc turned over in the New York case contained 9,000 subfolders.\n\nKelly, 52, stood in court during a Wednesday status hearing in orange jail clothes and slippers, his hands behind his back. Several supporters waved as marshals led him back to jail and he nodded in their direction.\n\nThe hearing came a day after Kelly was transferred from a restrictive unit at a Chicago federal jail into the general inmate population despite earlier concerns inmates might target him because he is a celebrity.\n\nAnother defense attorney, Michael Leonard, told reporters after Wednesday\u2019s hearing that Kelly was in his best emotional state since his detention in July because he was no longer isolated in jail.\n\n\u201cYou can see a kind of unburdening of his spirit now that he is in general population,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nLeinenweber didn\u2019t address a defense motion to reconsider Kelly\u2019s detention and to release him pending trial, saying he\u2019d rule at a Sept. 18 hearing.\n\nLeonard said Kelly, if released, wanted to reside with two women who lived with him before his arrest, Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary. Savage\u2019s parents have alleged she was held against her will by Kelly. She has denied that.\n\nThe 13 federal counts in Chicago accuse Kelly of filming himself having sex with underage girls and of paying off potential witnesses in his 2008 trial - at which he was acquitted - to get them to change their stories. Kelly has pleaded not guilty in all the cases but the one in Minnesota, where he will be arraigned later.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Tarm on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mtarm\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A judge Wednesday set an April 27 trial date in R.
