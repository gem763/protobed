It said there were 'strong' opportunities to boost UK exports to the Middle East after Brexit, but added: 'The main risk facing any closer UK relations with the Middle East and North Africa is a UK government led by Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n'Middle Eastern states are closely observing the political process in the UK and will only make strategic moves once the threat of a Corbyn-led government subsides.\n\n'Should Corbyn become PM, the UK's relations with the region will suffer on the political, economic and security levels.'\n\nCorbyn has been highly critical of several Middle Eastern countries in the past.\n\nHe has repeatedly criticised Saudi Arabia over its human rights record and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCorbyn has accused it of funding terrorist groups and called for UK arms sales to the country to be halted over its bombing campaign against Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, he was criticised in the past for describing terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah as 'friends' and for making a salute linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, angering Arab states who view it as an extremist group.\n\nOn top of this, an Israeli minister this year claimed the Labour leader 'hates the state of Israel and hates the Jewish people' amid concerns about the handling of anti-Semitism allegations that have rocked his party.'\n\nCorbyn has repeatedly denied being anti-Semitic.\n\nCornerstone's report adds: 'A government led by Jeremy Corbyn will not only make it extremely unlikely for most Middle Eastern states to agree on trade deals with the UK, it may also negatively impact existing trade relations.\n\n'The overall impact will be significant potential loss of British jobs, an increase in the security threat and a permanent deterioration in Britain's geopolitical standing in the Middle East, to the benefit of Russia and China.'\n\nIt said 250,000 jobs could be threatened. The UK's biggest trading partner in the Middle East is the United Arab Emirates with exports to the country worth \u00a37.8 billion a year. That is followed by Saudi Arabia, with exports worth \u00a33.4 billion, and Qatar with exports worth \u00a32.4 billion.\n\nExports to Egypt and Israel are next, with both markets worth \u00a31.2 billion to British firms.", "description": "Britain's biggest trading partners in the region, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel, view Corbyn 'negatively' and 'with suspicion', a report by Cornerstone Global has said.", "authors": ["Matt Oliver For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
