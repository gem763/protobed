(NASDAQ: ULH) has seen peak season sentiment move the opposite direction among its customer base in the last couple of weeks.\n\nULH's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Rogers and Chief Financial Officer Jude Beres were on hand today, September 5, at the Cowen and Company 12th Annual Global Transportation Conference to provide an overview of the company and the market.\n\nRogers said that intermodal volumes are still slow and that they haven't seen the seasonal pickup they were anticipating thus far in the third quarter.\n\nULH's intermodal business provides port drayage services. The company focuses on container movements in the ports and isn't directly involved in domestic railroad intermodal movements. Historically, ULH's intermodal business sees the bulk of its revenue in the third and fourth quarters of the year.\n\nRogers said, \"Inbound drayage is typically huge in the third quarter getting ready for the holiday season [supplying all the retail], but we have not seen a pick up yet which is unusual. It's not scary yet because the volumes are still okay, but it's just not what I would call a normal buildup for peak season.\"\n\nWhen asked if ULH's customers are expecting a peak season, Rogers said that their customers hadn't indicated plans to change their positive outlook around peak season as recent as two to three weeks ago. This was similar to the commentary J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.(NASDAQ: JBHT) provided at the same conference the previous day. However, Rogers said that in the last couple of weeks their customers are \"hedging their bets a little bit\" and \"backing off\" of their initial expectations for a \"gangbuster\" peak season.\n\nRogers said that the economy is still \"decent\" along with a \"strong\" consumer. He said that one of its largest customers \u2013 Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) \u2013 is still \"pushing record volumes\" through ULH's distribution centers. Walmart reported its strongest U.S. sales growth in more than a decade in its second quarter earnings report three weeks ago. Rogers contended that the company's drayage comparisons are still favorable to 2017, but not to 2018, which included some inventory pull forward ahead of tariffs.\n\n\n\nAt the same conference, third-party logistics and multimodal transportation services provider, Radiant Logistics, Inc. (NYSE: RLGT) didn't really have a call on expectations for this year's peak season. The company's founder and Chief Executive Officer Bohn Crain said that the company was seeing some freight pull forward, but that coastal warehouse capacity is largely tapped out, making it difficult to pull forward a material amount of goods. Of Radiant's $900 million in total revenue, $200 million is truly exposed to international air and ocean freight forwarding.\n\nDriver market update\n\nRogers provided an update on the current driver market. He said that ULH has the largest pipeline of new hire drayage drivers ever. He believes that most drivers are chasing the freight, leaving the capacity-oversupplied traditional over-the-road market in favor of more consistent freight. He believes that the company is having success seating drivers in its dedicated offering and noted that they are currently looking to hire 300 drivers in Fort Wayne, Indiana for a piece of dedicated business. He said that irregular route, over-the-road, agent-based drivers are \"unicorns.\"\n\nAs far as driver wages are concerned, ULH implemented a large driver pay increase in 2018. Rogers said that this is the new baseline for driver pay and that they aren't able to go back to the driver to reduce pay rates simply due to declining TL rates. Increased driver wages due to multiple rounds of wage increases in tighter TL markets have created a bit of a margin squeeze for many carriers. The squeeze is less of an issue with ULH's owner-operator drivers because they receive the same portion of the freight bill, it's just lower year-over-year. ULH renewed a union contract recently, which allows a modest 2 percent to 2.5 percent increase in driver wages.\n\nULH looking to more than double the side of its drayage unit\n\nStory continues", "description": "While management teams at some of the nation's largest truckload (TL) carriers have been talking up the potential for a solid peak shipping season, Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc.
