This farm is one of the largest. It's growing corn for the number-one beer producer in the country. Business Angola went to meet one international company that is betting on and investing in Malanje Province.\n\nThe French-based Castel Group has started a farm to grow corn in Malanje to save on importing the crop. It's coarsely milled into grits that are used to brew their top-selling Angolan beers.\n\nThey're developing it in stages, having bought a 5,000-hectare concession from the government.\n\nAngola's breadbasket\n\nThe farm\u2019s boss, Sebastien Ducroquet, drove Euronews across the Fazenda Socamia to see the harvest - there are two per year thanks to the warm weather. This year they expect a yield of about 3,000 tonnes.\n\nDucroquet explained why the area is so interesting for agriculture:\n\n\"We are just along the Kwanza River, which borders our property for 5 kilometres. Since we\u2019re going to do irrigation, it\u2019s ideal to have a large river right nearby. Then the soil is of good quality, and we have good access by road to the capital Luanda. So to export the production, that\u2019s really an advantage.\"\n\nMaking use of the Kwanza River, the farm plans to begin installing sprinkler irrigation this year to boost production.\n\nAnd the company has even more plans for investment in the years ahead, Ducroquet says:\n\n\"In 2020 we will install silos for a storage capacity of 20000 tonnes, with a dryer for the corn. In five or six years, we will certainly install a corn mill to produce grits on the farm, to provide grits for our breweries.\"\n\nTo have enough grits for Castel\u2019s nine breweries, they\u2019ll also outsource, supporting the development of the local economy.\n\n\"We will buy corn from other farms of the same kind as ours in Angola, and we will buy some corn as well from small producers around our farm,\" Ducroquet says.\n\nThe Long View\n\nOne of those breweries lies west of Angola's capital, Luanda, and it produces thousands of bottles per hour.\n\nPhilippe Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is the director of Castel Group in Angola head of the Castel Group in Angola, a company that has invested in the country for 25 years and employs some 5,000 people.\n\n\"It's worth it because it's a country that is geographically very large, with a relatively large potential, and a young population. Today, we know well that Angola has enormous agricultural potential for cereal production.\"\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric says that kind of diversification, and import substitution, not only helps the economy but his company as well:\n\n\"It's attractive because today we import most of our raw materials. It's logical that the main industries her try now to domestically produce the raw materials that are possible to make.\"\n\nIf this kind of diversification makes sense for business, and also for financial institutions like Standard Bank.\n\nYonne Castro is an Executive Board Member at Standard Bank, Angola:\n\n\"The potential of Malanje province is immense. It is one of the provinces that have greater agricultural potential, not only for its fertile soils, for having abundant water, and also for its great potential for tourism.\"\n\nThat\u00b4s why, for many, corn is Angola's gold - and Malanje province a great place to invest.", "description": "Mining Angola's golden harvest in Malanje province", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/99/87/56/1000x563_cmsv2_438904a4-12f1-5159-81ce-f8e43d1ea781-3998756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
