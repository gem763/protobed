Here's what you need to know as you start the new day and the new work week ...\n\nTurkey announces incursion of northeast Syria, Kurds vow 'all-out' war as US troops are moved from area\n\nThe White House announced late Sunday that Turkey will soon move forward with its planned military operation in northeast Syria in an area where U.S. troops have been deployed and operating with Kurdish-led forces. The U.S. will not be involved in the operation, the White House said. President Trump spoke with Turkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdogan by telephone. U.S. troops will be moved from the area.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., should be impeached over their handling of the whistleblower investigation. Trump said \"Nervous Nancy\" was aware of \"Shifty Adam Schiff\" and his \"massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people.\u201d Trump pointed to Schiff's recent \u201cparody\u201d speech in Congress where he read a dramatization of the president's July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's hearing.\n\nTrump has been under an impeachment investigation over his interaction Zelensky after it was revealed that he requested that Ukraine government officials investigate the Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, improvised parts of the transcript for effect and framed it as satire. Trump was also apparently eluding to reports that Schiff's false earlier claim that the unnamed whistleblower did not speak to his committee.

A second unidentified whistleblower was confirmed Sunday morning, reportedly with firsthand information to support some of the allegations made by the first whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry on Trump. Graham said that if Democrats follow through on their desire to impeach Trump, he will make sure that the whistleblowers will have to come forward and testify.\n\nGM-UAW talks take turn for worse; settlement not near\n\nIt was a rough weekend for settlement talks in the now four-week-old strike by UAW workers against General Motors. Talks took a turn for the worse, hitting a big snag over product commitments for U.S. factories, a union official wrote in an email to members. The letter from UAW Vice President Terry Dittes casts doubt on whether there will be a quick settlement in the contract dispute, which sent 49,000 workers to the picket lines on Sept. 16, crippling GM's factories.\n\nSupreme Court kicks off election-year agenda with hot-button immigration, guns and abortion cases\n\nU.S. Supreme Court will launch its new term Monday, and a 5-4 conservative majority could be poised to provide the White House with significant legal and political victories -- or setbacks. Such are the unusual dynamics now percolating from the nation's highest court. The justices' election-year agenda includes cases dealing with Trump's executive power over immigration, along with LGBTQ workplace discrimination, gun rights and abortion regulations. All are teed up to be argued this term, with religious liberty and health-care appeals good bets to be added to the docket. All will likely be decided in a presidential election year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTODAY'S MUST-READS\n\n'Joker' sets new box office record.\n\nElton John writes Queen Elizabeth slapped her nephew across the face in front of him in new book.\n\nBeto O'Rourke confronted by woman on illegal immigration, Second Amendment.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX BUSINESS\n\nHSBC to cut up to 10,000 jobs in drive to slash costs.\n\nProtesters charged in violence following Hong Kong's new mask ban.\n\nInvested in you - US economists wrestle with how to help 'left behind' areas.\n\n#TheFlashback: CLICK HERE to find out what happened on \"This Day in History.\"\n\nSOME PARTING WORDS\n\nSteve Hilton gives his take on what impeachment push on President Trump is really about and urges Democrats to stop their obsession with scandal - for America's sake.\n\nNot signed up yet for Fox News First?
