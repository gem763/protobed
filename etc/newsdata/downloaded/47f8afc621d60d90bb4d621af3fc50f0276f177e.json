At the ceremony in Malaysia, the bride wore her Jacob Arabo ring valued at \u00a3203k (above)\n\nSources say cracks began to appear in the marriage between the notoriously private royal and his Russian reality TV star bride shortly after a celebration of their union in December. Oksana says she was left penniless after he left so she had to sell her wedding ring (above) to pay bills\n\nSources close to Oksana told the Kremlin's most loyal newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that the royal, who abdicated the Malaysian throne in January, 'did not pay a dime' towards to cost of 'his son' who she gave birth to in May.\n\nOksana today confirmed to MailOnline that she had sold the ring - which matches one worn by Victoria Beckham - 'just before giving birth to my son.\n\nThe former King of Malaysia and his ex-wife Oksana Voevodina are locked in a bitter divorce after their short-lived marriage\n\n'I wont say the price I sold it for, but it was three times less than its cost,' she said.\n\n'I used this money to cover my medical bills in Switzerland as I was at risk of losing the baby.'\n\nShe had borrowed to pay her Swiss hospital costs for two months and needed the money from the ring to meet her debts.\n\n'He abandoned her and she had to pay medical costs so she did not lose the baby,' said a friend.\n\n'It was a real danger. So she was forced to pawn the ring.'\n\nHer new onslaught against the Malaysian royal came after palace sources portrayed her to MailOnline as a gold-digger seeking an \u00a38 million home in London, \u00a31.2m Moscow apartment and a \u00a324,000-a-month allowance to cover the son conceived in their short-lived one year marriage.\n\nBoth sides agree that the Sultan suddenly left Oksana in December but they are now engaged in a bitter war of words over the breakup.\n\nHe asked: 'Who does she think I am... Bill Gates?.'\n\nThe sultan has blasted his ex-wife Oksana's 'ridiculous' demands after they said she wanted an \u00a38m London home, a flat in Moscow for \u00a31.2m and \u00a324,000 per month for their son, Leon\n\nBut sources close to Oksana say claims he is the poorest sultan in Malaysia do not stand scrutiny.\n\nHe had splashed out 'several million dollars' on yachts and nightclub parties in Ibiza to mark her 25th birthday in 2017, they told KP.\n\nHe had property around the world, a fleet of 90 exclusive cars, and there is documented evidence that he spends \u00a350m million a year, they claimed.\n\nThey denied a claim by palace insiders that her son Leon was named after her former close Russian male friend Leonid Zasukhin.\n\nIn fact, the name Leon was in honour of a friend of her husband's, say her supporters.\n\nHis other name Ismail is after the sultan's father Ismail, who died last month.\n\nThe Moscow newspaper reported: 'Oksana lives in a rented apartment. The ex-King has not bought any housing for her and son.'\n\nThe sultan says he hasn't met Oksana's son Leon (pictured in his pram), who was born in May. He is said to have left her in early December when she was four months pregnant\n\nAides of the ex-king, known to friends as Faris, said a key reason for the breakup was was sale or leaking of pictures of the couple's November 2018 wedding party to the Russian media.\n\nThis revealed the couple's marriage to the but Muhammad V had seen his wedding to Oksana as a private matter and did not want the publicity.\n\nBut KP revealed a letter from wedding guest Madomedsultan Aliyev apologising to both the sultan and Oksana for putting posting the wedding celebrations online, suggesting that the Russian bride had not been behind this.\n\nPalace aides told MailOnline that 'professional' pictures and footage from the wedding also leaked and repeated that she was held responsible for this.", "description": "Russian beauty Oksana Voevodina, 27, says she was so in need of cash to pay her medical bills that she had to sell her ring designed by Jacob Arabo for \u00a3203,000 after her marriage broke down.", "authors": ["Will Stewart For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19399080-0-image-a-6_1570457470114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
