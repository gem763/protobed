And then they said Crown Jewel and I\u2019m like, \u201cthey\u2019re gonna wrestle one on one at Crown Jewel?!\u201d\n\n\u2018Then they said \u2018we\u2019re team captains\u2019 \u2013 smart move.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen WWE returns to Riyadh on 31 October, Hogan and Flair will each be lending their name to a team of current superstars, rather than looking to recapture the glory days by dusting off their trunks and boots themselves.\n\nSo far, WWE Universal Champion Seth Rollins and the Bulgarian Brute Rusev have been chosen to represent the Hulkster, while the Nature Boy\u2019s squad will feature Randy Orton and King Corbin.\n\nFormer UFC star Riddle has been very open about his views on former stars stepping back in the ring, and he was openly critical after Goldberg and The Undertaker\u2019s clash at Super Showdown in Jeddah earlier this year which saw both stars having to redeem themselves in subsequent matches with younger opponents.\n\nMatt Riddle thinks that Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan have made a \u2018smart move\u2019 by not putting themselves on the line (Picture: WWE)\n\nThis time, though, he admitted he has no problems with Hogan and Flair coming back in a non-wrestling role because they still have a lot to offer in that capacity.\n\nHe added: \u2018I love Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan \u2013 they killed it entertaining us for how many years? It\u2019s fine if they\u2019re not wrestling.\u2019\n\nThe Original Bro\u2019s comments are much kinder than those directed at Goldberg, who recently reacted angrily when the NXT star was brought up in a blue carpet interview in Los Angeles and has since admitted his follow-up match with Dolph Ziggler at SummerSlam was a moment of redemption for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite an apparent snub by the former world champion, Riddle told us he totally understands the idea of people saying what they can to make waves in such a competitive industry.\n\n\u2018People like to stir up attention and people react,\u2019 he smirked. \u2018You know me, I like to stir the pot all the time!\u2019\n\nFriday Night SmackDown airs every week at 1am on Sky Sports Arena and Main Event.
