REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint cited a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden, one of the leading Democratic candidates seeking to challenge him in 2020, and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to get dirt on a political rival for personal political gain. Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call came after he froze nearly $400 million in aid intended to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country. The aid was later provided.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee is leading the impeachment inquiry. The inquiry in the Democratic-led House could lead to approval of articles of impeachment against the Republican president and a subsequent trial in the Republican-led Senate on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Sunday he expects the whistleblower to appear before the panel very soon. [nL2N26K04E]\n\nWhile Congress is on a two-week recess, members of the committee will return to the U.S. Capitol this week to carry out an investigation that is likely to produce new subpoenas for documents and other material.\n\nThe committee is scheduled to hold a closed-door hearing on Friday with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who concluded that the whistleblower complaint was of urgent concern and appeared credible.\n\nHouse investigators are set to take the first witness testimony from two people mentioned in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nOn Wednesday, three House committees - Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight - are due to get a deposition from former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who Trump labelled \u201cbad news\u201d during his call with Zelenskiy.\n\nOn Thursday, the committees are set to get a deposition from Trump\u2019s former special representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, who resigned last week after the whistleblower complaint named him as one of two U.S. diplomats who followed up with Ukrainian officials a day after Trump\u2019s call to Zelenskiy. [nW1N25N00T]\n\nThe whistleblower has not been publicly identified. Trump, in a series of Twitter posts on Sunday evening, said he wanted to \u201cmeet\u201d the whistleblower, who he called \u201cmy accuser,\u201d as well as \u201cthe person who illegally gave this information\u201d to the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nSome House Democrats said articles of impeachment against Trump could move to the House floor as soon as next month.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s several weeks,\u201d House Judiciary Committee member David Cicilline told reporters last week. \u201cHe has already admitted that he contacted a foreign leader and discussed with him ginning up a fake story about one of his political opponents.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to the Ukraine scandal. House Democrats also have sought material from the White House and Justice Department. [nL2N26I09M]\n\nSchiff said any effort by Trump to stonewall the probe could be used to impeach him for obstructing Congress.\n\nTrump has withstood repeated scandals since taking office in 2017. House Democrats considered, but never moved ahead with, pursuing articles of impeachment over Trump\u2019s actions relating to Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election aimed at boosting his candidacy.\n\nThe United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014.", "description": "The House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over his request that a foreign power investigate a domestic political rival is set to intensify this week with testimony due from witnesses concerning allegations made by a whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435405699&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T086", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
