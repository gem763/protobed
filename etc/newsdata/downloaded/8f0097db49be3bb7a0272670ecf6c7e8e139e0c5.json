The final 31-15 score against the Chicago Bears didn\u2019t indicate how bad the Redskins were before the Bears eased up. The Redskins didn\u2019t seem to consider that they might want to block Khalil Mack. The defense continued to bleed passing yards, even to struggling Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. Trubisky was 20-of-23 for 173 yards and three touchdowns at halftime. Redskins quarterback Case Keenum threw three interceptions and while he rallied a bit in the second half, it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome a horrendous start.\n\nWith 41 seconds left in the first half, Taylor Gabriel beat $75 million cornerback Josh Norman for a touchdown, somehow getting both feet in bounds on the sideline. That made the score 28-0. If anyone stuck around after that, they were probably wearing blue and orange. At that point, Washington had 36 yards on offense more than 29 minutes into the half. The Redskins are 0-3 after the loss.\n\nIt has been miserable in Washington for a while, and you wonder how much patience Snyder has left. He can\u2019t fire all the players. But Jay Gruden certainly shouldn\u2019t feel safe if things don\u2019t improve soon.\n\nWashington struggles against Chicago\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s practically nothing positive for the Redskins right now. That much seemed clear when left tackle Trent Williams held out and it seemed he\u2019d rather have his career end than play for Washington anymore. And the Redskins still haven\u2019t traded him.\n\nSnyder doesn\u2019t want to lose, but he doesn\u2019t know how to win. He was petulant and impatient for most of his ownership of the team. Then he decided to be patient with Gruden. At the start of this season, 11 NFL head coaches had been with their teams at least five years. Gruden was the only one with a losing record. He was also the only one without a playoff win.\n\nPatience with Gruden isn\u2019t paying off. His offense isn\u2019t stocked with playmakers, but it still looked lost on Monday night, at least before showing some signs of life in the second half. A late rally was stopped when Danny Trevathan met Keenum on a fourth-and-1 jump over the line and knocked the ball loose for a fumble.\n\nKeenum struggled but it wasn\u2019t all his fault. The offensive line did very little to protect him, and Washington often didn\u2019t keep in extra players to compensate. After Keenum\u2019s second interception, with the Bears leading 21-0, ESPN showed the graphic that Keenum had been hit on seven of his 14 dropbacks and sacked twice. It\u2019s hard to play quarterback with Mack in your lap most plays. One of Keenum\u2019s interceptions was returned by Bears safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix for a touchdown.\n\nMaybe first-round pick Dwayne Haskins will get a shot soon. Maybe the Redskins don\u2019t want to expose him in a bad situation.\n\nWhat can Washington do?\n\nIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s much to revitalize the fan base. Cutting a 28-point deficit to 13 points in the fourth quarter isn\u2019t going to sell tickets.\n\nThe Redskins were once a proud franchise with a long waiting list for season tickets. Attendance has plummeted. Fans are disowning the team at a remarkable rate. The losing is a factor. So is the soulless stadium. But it seems the biggest reason is the franchise has become unlikeable under Snyder.\n\nWinning would solve a lot of that. But Washington doesn\u2019t look close to turning that corner.\n\nIt might be time for Washington to try a new plan. Gruden likely won\u2019t be given much more time to turn things around.\n\nChicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack (52) hits Washington Redskins quarterback Case Keenum (8).
