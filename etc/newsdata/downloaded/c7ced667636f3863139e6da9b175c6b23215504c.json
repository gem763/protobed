Anything people can build can also be destroyed\u2026and unfortunately, that includes the civilisation that Rick and so many others worked so hard to establish.\n\n\u201cSilence the Whisperers\u201d is a very thoughtful episode of The Walking Dead, which is not an adjective that normally gets used to describe the show. Obviously, it isn\u2019t close to the level of, say, Breaking Bad or Mad Men, but this time, the major threat to the various colonists isn\u2019t from zombies or the Whisperers, but themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Whisperers and zombies aren\u2019t still threats\u2014when a tree falls just before a surprise zombie attack at Hilltop, the Whisperers are blamed immediately by its angry inhabitants\u2014but it\u2019s the fear of and hate for the Whisperers that starts causing the real damage at Alexandria. It begins when season nine bully Gage, Margo (the new leader of the Highwaypeople), and some other kid who presumably has a name which I can\u2019t remember start hassling Lydia, cruelly teasing her by putting a burlap sack with eyeholes on their heads to mock her origin. There have been plenty of bullies on The Walking Dead before, of course, so what\u2019s most disturbing here is that Whisperer-hating Aaron is there, seeing it all, and just letting it happen.\n\nBetween Lydia and Judith, Negan (Jeffry Dean Morgan) is turning into Gamera, Friend to All Children. (Image: Eliza Morse, AMC)\n\nInstead, it\u2019s the increasingly redeemed Negan who\u2019s there for Lydia, telling her not to fight them, but to \u201ckill\u201d her tormentors with kindness\u2014arguably the most anti-Saviour-era policy he could advise, but one he\u2019s told her on more than one occasion. Of course, when Daryl spots the two of them talking, he breaks them up immediately, more because he knows that fraternizing with Negan will only cause people to hate Lydia rather than his distrust for Negan, although that\u2019s certainly a factor. Lydia tartly replies that Negan gets her, just as she and Daryl come to their shared home and discover someone has graffitied \u201cSilence the Whisperers\u201d on their door.\n\nHate speech is never a good sign, obviously, and Lydia doesn\u2019t even try to the kindness approach. Instead, she plops down next to them at lunch, starts gutting a whole squirrel so that blood sprays on Gage\u2019s face, and gives them a big, whispered \u201cShh.\u201d Again, none of Alexandria\u2019s leaders try to defuse the increasingly tense situation until Daryl pulls her out, and foolishly asks if Lydia can just avoid her tormenters. Lydia justifiably storms off.\n\nThat night, everything goes to hell. After dark, Gage, Margo, and Other Jerk assault Lydia, restraining her and beating her, even as she desperately reminds them she\u2019d abandoned the Whisperers long before Alpha put their friends\u2019 heads on spikes, that she loved Henry, that the Alexandrians are her people now, all of which only infuriates the attackers more. It\u2019s an immensely disturbing scene\u2014certainly more than any graphic death by zombie\u2014and if you were still waiting to get on the Good Negan bandwagon, watching him burst onto the scene, throw Margo to the side, pull Gage off Lydia, and hold and console her then and there, well, hop on board.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: Margo is dead.\n\nAMC has only two official photos of Margo (Jerri Tubbs) and this is one of them. It\u2019s fitting. (Image: Gene Page, AMC)\n\nNegan killed her when he threw her to the side to protect Lydia; by the hefty \u201csquelch\u201d sound effect that accompanies her landing, her head presumably landed on a rock. And now, even though neither Negan nor Lydia was at fault\u2014because Margo was the actual attacker\u2014the two most hated people in Alexandria are seen as killers of one of \u201cthe good guys.\u201d\n\nLydia tries to defend Negan, but the Alexandrians want blood. However, Daryl believes Lydia and later goes to confront Negan in his cell, resulting in what is one of The Walking Dead\u2019s best-written conversations ever. I could honestly quote the whole thing, but here\u2019s a snippet of Negan talking to Daryl, right after he says he\u2019s not at all sorry for killing an arsehole who was beating a kid:\n\n\u201cBut you already know that, don\u2019t you? You came down here to look me in the eye because you don\u2019t know what to do with me. Shit, all that time you spent trying to kill me you spent fantasizing about my death, all that time you actually tried to kill me, and now look at you? You\u2019re not so sure.\u201d\n\nNegan also wryly loves the irony that he started believing in Alexandria\u2019s way of life and moral code, and now he\u2019s going to be executed for actually doing the right thing. When Daryl says he\u2019ll get a fair trial, Negan scoffs. But we\u2019ll never know, because the next morning, when Gabriel goes to the jail to talk to the accused, Negan is gone. This, of course, is only going to make things much, much worse in Alexandria, and Lydia quickly confesses to letting Negan loose and marches right into the cell\u2014even though Daryl knows for a fact Lydia didn\u2019t do it. But when he tries to get Lydia to leave the jail, she won\u2019t because she feels safe there\u2014just as Negan voluntarily returned to his cell after the possibly-Whisperer-caused zombie attack in the season premiere. Negan knew people would start looking to punish an old enemy because they couldn\u2019t fight their new enemy, and Lydia knows that with Negan gone, the Alexandrians will take out their anger and fear on the one scapegoat they have left.\n\nLydia\u2019s safety is paramount, and not just because she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. As Michonne reminds Daryl earlier in the episode, the only thing that has kept Alpha from annihilating them all with her Zombie Bomb is because her daughter is inside Alexandria\u2019s walls. If Lydia leaves or Alpha somehow learns she\u2019s in danger, they are doomed.\n\n\u201cSilence the Whisperers\u201d is an episode about bullies\u2014the arseholes bullying Lydia, Alpha bullying the colonists, and Negan, who used to bully the colonists\u2014and repercussions. On their way to Hilltop, Michonne tells Judith there are some bullies you can live with, but there are others who will never stop taking what\u2019s yours. Negan had to be stopped back in the day, and Alpha needs to be stopped now. And despite Daryl and Negan\u2019s futile suggestions, no matter what Lydia did, Gage, Margo, and Other Jerk were never going to leave her alone. However it played out, it was always going to end in tragedy for somebody. It was true with Negan, and it\u2019s already true with Alpha and the Whisperers, too.\n\nBut the episode is also about those internal fractures that weaken the whole. The fear of the Whisperers is threatening to overcome the civilized society forged in Alexandria. Magda and Yumiko\u2019s relationship has begun fraying because of the latter\u2019s control issues and Siddiq\u2019s PTSD is getting worse\u2014much worse\u2014to the point he may now be useless in an emergency.\n\nKhary Payton does some fantastic work as Ezekiel in this episode. (Image: Gene Page, AMC)\n\nThe most poignant example is Ezekiel, who Michonne spies riding alone as she travels to Hilltop. When she catches up with him, he\u2019s standing on a ledge, dead-eyed and hopeless, not jumping purely because of the inertia of sadness. He\u2019s lost the Kingdom, Carol, Henry, even his tiger Shiva, and all he feels is his loss and his failure. (Kudos to actor Khary Payton, because he captures that faraway, sick look of utter depression perfectly.) But when Michonne reaches out to him, it draws him away from the ledge, literally and metaphorically.\n\nDesperate for connection, Ezekiel impulsively kisses Michonne, who takes more than a few beats to pull back\u2014as she says later, she hasn\u2019t kissed anyone over four feet tall in six years\u2014but it\u2019s her empathy that helps him. It was last mentioned a long, long time ago, but Michonne lost her first child in the zombie outbreak, and for a while, she was attacking zombies primarily in hopes they\u2019d kill her, and she and Ezekiel bond over how much harder it is to recover after losing everything a second time. It\u2019s a pretty clear comparison between the power of coming together in compassion and the danger of coming together in fear and hate.\n\nUnfortunately, the latter is much more prevalent in Alexandria, even as people realise the massive zombie attacks on all three colonies (Oceanside\u2019s occurs off-screen) can\u2019t be a coincidence. As Carol tells Daryl, all the turmoil over Negan and Lydia and Margo is just a distraction, because the real enemy is outside. She\u2019s not wrong, but she\u2019s not exactly right, either. Because there\u2019s a very real enemy inside Alexandria, too, and it\u2019s not Negan or Lydia.\n\nLuke (Dan Folger), wielding the best post-apocalyptic weapon ever.
