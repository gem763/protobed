Now a recent spate of House Republican resignations and optimistic polling has the Democratic Party ready for an all-out electoral assault.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLast night\u2019s Democratic debate in Houston is no coincidence. The decision to spotlight Texas marks a belated acknowledgement by party elites that Texas is not only competitive, but potentially winnable. For the first time in memory, the presidential debate stage featured not just one but two prominent Democrats who call Texas home.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nFor millennial voters, Texas gained its ruby-red reputation after elevating native son and previous youth movement b\u00eate-noir George W Bush to the White House. Bush\u2019s mannerisms and eccentricities became the running Texan stereotype: gun-toting, hyper-religious, contemptuous of the educated and unquestioningly conservative. The state hadn\u2019t voted for a Democratic president since 1976 \u2013 before most millennials were born. Texas was a lost cause.\n\nRumors of Texas\u2019s death as a purple state turned out to be greatly exaggerated. While predominantly white Democratic elites wrote off Texan congressional districts and Senate seats as wastes of party money, grassroots Latinx and LGBTQ coalitions sprang into action in cities like Austin, El Paso and San Antonio. Each electoral cycle narrowed the voter gap between complacent Republicans and upstart, progressive Democrats.\n\nIn 2013, freshman Congressman Joaquin Castro urged Democrats to rethink their Texas playbook. The voters were there, Castro insisted. Adapting the message wouldn\u2019t be enough; Democrats would need better messengers. Six years later, Castro\u2019s brother Julian took the presidential debate stage to introduce Blue Texas to a new generation of voters.\n\nThe most successful of these new political messengers shatter the gloomy stereotypes about Texas Democrats. Earlier this week, presidential contender Elizabeth Warren endorsed Jessica Cisneros in a Justice Democrats-backed primary of pro-NRA Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar. Cisneros is a strong voice for gun safety, the Green New Deal and a host of progressive ideas once considered nonstarters in Texas.\n\nWarren\u2019s endorsement comes with clout: a recent Texas Tribune poll shows Warren in second place there, ahead of Texan Beto O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke nearly unseated Republican Senator Ted Cruz last cycle, a feat impressive enough to make O\u2019Rourke a brief national celebrity.\n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t just mobilizing for federal races. The Texas Democratic Party shocked election analysts by flipping a dozen seats in the state House of Representatives in 2018. That leaves Democrats only nine seats short of the majority \u2013 an unheard-of prospect even five years ago. Texas state legislative races have become so competitive for Democrats that national money, long a fantasy for the Texas Democrats, is finally flowing into party coffers.\n\nRepublicans are so rattled that Texans have coined a term for the flood of retirements and resignations: \u201cTexodus.\u201d Five Republican congressman have announced they will not seek re-election. Congressman Will Hurd, once considered a Republican rising star, bowed out of the race two weeks ago. Democrats are already fielding candidates that look more like Cisneros and O\u2019Rourke than the Blue Dog Democrats of old.\n\nThe wilting of Republican prospects across Texas can be attributed in large part to the ideologically directionless chaos sown by President Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d immigration policy and family separation scandal have created a human rights disaster on America\u2019s southern border, and many Texans are disgusted by the mounting human cost. Latinx communities that once aligned with Republicans on religious issues have now mobilized in defense of their loved ones and communities. These voters have seen the inhumanity of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration disaster. They want it to end.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Republicans are also losing traditionally conservative, suburban whites. Many share the national disgust at Trump\u2019s immigration policies, but a larger number are recent arrivals drawn from other states by Texas\u2019s growing job market. These voters are shaking up the electoral math and driving suburban Republicans to retire instead of facing an uphill political fight.\n\nDonald Trump is still solidly ahead of his Democratic competitors in Texas, but voters are poised to send a stinging rebuke to state Republicans and further reduce Republican hold on the US House of Representatives. The long-held dream of turning Texas into a Democratic stronghold still lingers in the future, but for the first time younger Democrats are optimistic enough to take to the field in force.\n\nWhen Texas finally does flip, one thing is certain: the coalition that carries the day won\u2019t look anything like the stereotypes. Democrats have the opportunity to write a new \u2013 and brighter \u2013 chapter.\n\nMax Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and senior contributor at Millennial Politics.
