Hines, a real-estate investment development firm, will likely take over the project, the people said.\n\nSacramento officials had cheered the pension fund\u2019s decision last year to move forward with CIM\u2019s plan for an office-condominium-retail complex that would have been Sacramento\u2019s tallest tower. The $381 billion pension fund, known by its nickname Calpers, abandoned a previous development plan for the same site in 2007 and it has sat empty for more than a decade. A memo prepared for Calpers by real estate consultant RCLCo was critical of CIM\u2019s performance. The parcel at 301 Capital Mall is located along the road that runs between the California State Capitol building and the city\u2019s iconic Tower Bridge. CIM said in a statement that Calpers approached it in 2007 to help with the parcel after the pension fund parted ways with a previous developer. \u201cWe at CIM believe the project we and CalPERS created is a good solution for the site, albeit not the only solution,\u201d the statement said.
