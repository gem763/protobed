It's called Apple TV Plus, and it's scheduled to launch in November at $5/month.\n\nLike other streaming services, Apple is financing the production of original TV shows and movies.\n\nUnlike those services, it sounds like Apple is looking to release its movies in theatres before they end up on Apple TV Plus, according to a new report in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nVisit BusinessInsider.co.za for more stories.\n\nApple's got a major new streaming service scheduled to launch this November, named Apple TV Plus.\n\nLike Netflix and Hulu, Apple's TV Plus is a subscription-based streaming video service that Apple plans to populate with its own produced content.

Jackson and Anthony Mackie; another, named \"Hala,\" was picked up by Apple after a big debut at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. It tells the story of \"a high school senior struggling to balance being a suburban teenager with her traditional Muslim upbringing.\"\n\nAmazon releases some of its original film productions in theatres before they arrive on Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix is planning to do the same with 10 upcoming films, but the relationship between streaming services and traditional theatres has been hot and cold.\n\nApple has yet to comment on the report, and didn't respond to a request for comment as of publishing.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Apple's new TV Plus streaming service is expected to launch in November \u2014 a direct competitor to services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9414/191abf44076b4881afaf15b2c19ccb30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
