They\u2019re All Wrong", "language": "en", "text": "Claim 2\n\nThe president said that tariffs are \u201ca powerful way to get companies to come back to the USA.\u201d Mr. Trump can\u2019t do much more than point to anecdotes of companies relocating to the United States. But the broader trend tells a different story. Most companies can\u2019t afford to shift their supply chains to use domestically produced parts or move their production back home. Data show that when companies move out of China, they\u2019re relocating to other countries in Southeast Asia.\n\nEven the Commerce Department acknowledges that companies face a tariff-related challenge when thinking about moving back here. Expect this trend to continue because the future of most manufacturing in America \u2014 including the automobile industry \u2014 is in exporting. Rising production costs in the United States means that to stay competitive, an increasingly large number of businesses will shift their production abroad.\n\nThe bottom line: It means fewer manufacturing jobs here than otherwise, not more.\n\nTariffs are just not a good way to sustain a domestic manufacturing revival. After picking up some steam in 2017 and 2018 thanks to deregulation and tax reform, the manufacturing sector is cooling down. The latest jobs report shows that in 2019, manufacturing employment has risen by a monthly average of 5,000 jobs. In 2018, that number was 22,000.\n\nA recent survey by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturing contracting in September and capital investment growth is slowing down, too. Even the heavily protected steel and aluminum sectors have started to see a decline in jobs this year.\n\nClaim 3\n\nOn that same day that Mr. Navarro was talking nonsense, the president tweeted that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d Wrong again. Instead, we found out that they are bad and difficult to wind down. We are nowhere near a trade deal with China. In fact, apart from a deal with South Korea, which required no congressional approval, no comprehensive and better trade deals are yet on the books, and most pending agreements are subpar when compared with what was agreed to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.", "description": "The president and his advisers have been deluded about what big tariff hikes and aggressive negotiating tactics will achieve.", "authors": ["Veronique De Rugy"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/opinion/07derugy1/07derugy1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
