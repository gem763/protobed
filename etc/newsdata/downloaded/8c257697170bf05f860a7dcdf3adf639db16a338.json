Squeezed between million-dollar apartments and Michelin-starred restaurants is a rising tide of homelessness: vagrants begging for scraps from the tech zillionaires on Market Street, families who couldn\u2019t afford the rent after the latest IPO, Uber drivers sleeping in their cars in the Safeway parking lot. The nouveau wealth capital of America is a land of decadence and irony, where Juul (banned from selling e-cigarettes in the county) just bought a $400 million office tower and Vinod Khosla thinks he owns the beach. Further down the 101 in Menlo Park and Sunnyvale, Facebook and Google employees are raising their kids tech-free.\n\nThis is the world the smartphone has built. In 1994, Vanity Fair inaugurated the New Establishment list to celebrate the rise of a new entrepreneurial class that promised\u2014how young we were then!\u2014to \u201cmake the world a better place.\u201d They were digital-age whiz kids challenging the old boys club, rebels and hackers getting their first taste of real power. Twenty-five years later, the upstarts are now the establishment, the undisputed titans of America\u2019s second gilded age.\n\nHow quickly it all changed. Twitter, which aided the Arab Spring, now abets America\u2019s culture civil war, and its cofounder Jack Dorsey is more concerned with going on silent retreats than silencing Nazis. Mark Zuckerberg, who dreamed of bringing free internet to Africa, spends his days dodging questions about the genocide in Myanmar. Dara Khosrowshahi has righted the amoral culture of Uber but is struggling to squeeze profits from its gig-economy workforce. (For SoftBank leader Masayoshi Son, self-driving cars can\u2019t come soon enough.) WeWork, another of SoftBank\u2019s crown jewels, is struggling to right the ship after the exit of CEO Adam Neumann, whose questionable business stratagems prompted investors to turn skittish and ultimately helped sink the company\u2019s IPO. Even Slack, which was going to save us from the drudgery of work, has merely insinuated drudgery deeper into the fiber of our lives.\n\nUnwinding the problems these entrepreneurs have wrought is difficult, as anyone on the 2019 New Establishment list can attest. YouTube\u2019s Susan Wojcicki has spoken passionately of \u201ctrying to strike a balance\u201d between removing hate speech and cultivating free expression but is quick with excuses when pressed on the specifics (\u201cIf we were to take down every video\u2026\u201d). Poor Zuckerberg couldn\u2019t for the life of him figure out how to rid Facebook of anti-vaxxers or Russian bots\u2014at least until regulators began threatening multibillion-dollar fines and high-profile tech insiders (including Tristan Harris and Roger McNamee) began speaking publicly about breaking up the company. \u201cFish don\u2019t see water,\u201d one tech investor explained when I asked how Silicon Valley sees itself in this age of cultural backlash. Another senior-level tech employee, who has worked in the industry for more than a decade, wasn\u2019t so kind. \u201cI don\u2019t think they smell their own shit,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is still a sense of wonder: Elon Musk is planning a Mars colony; Satya Nadella is pouring money into artificial intelligence; Larry Page has invested in flying cars. Wojcicki\u2019s younger sister, Anne, is building a genetic database that is already being used to design new drugs (with a $300 million investment from Glaxo\u00adSmithKline) and fuel cutting-edge academic research. Jeff Bezos has teamed up with titans of the financial industry to lower health care costs, while Brian Armstrong\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, aims to disrupt the financial industry altogether. In Hollywood, technology has forced the studios to compete with Netflix and Amazon, fueling another golden age of video.", "description": "So much for making the world a better place. After years of scandals, our millennial masters of the universe appear just as powerful\u2014and even more ruthless\u2014than the old guard they displaced. Maybe this is why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are so busy trying to move to Mars and the moon. Who would want to live on a planet that looks like San Francisco?", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Nick Bilto", "Keziah Weir", "Vanity Fair", "Laura Bradley", "Bess Levin", "Anthony Breznican", "Abigail Tracy", "Kenzie Bryant"], "top_image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d93ae1c34ce260008d1f54f/16:9/w_2560,c_limit/new-establishment-1119-nick-bilton-tout.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
