Using Kauai's smartphone app you could then claim five free smoothies \u2013 which have a minimum value of R190. From then on out you would save R1 on every smoothie you ordered in store after presenting you cup, as a perpetual discount.\n\nIf saving a minimum of R71 wasn't enough, you would also be saving on single-use plastic containers, as part of what Kauai has branded a \"healthy planet\" initiative.\n\nBut this week Kauai confirmed it was asking customers to return the cups, phoning each of the around 2,000 people who took on the offer, after the plan sprung a leak.\n\n\"It was discovered shortly after launch of our new reusable smoothie cups that in a small percentage of the cups, water droplets can get in between the two walls of the cup when fully immersed in water (usually during washing),\" the company told Business Insider South Africa.\n\nIt yanked the cups from sale, but not before selling a couple of thousand.\n\nSo far it has contacted about a quarter of those who had taken up the offer, and it hopes to have reached everyone by the end of next week, Kauai said.\n\nThe cups, or kups, can be returned at any store for a full refund. While buyers get to keep the vouchers for free smoothies, they will not be getting their R1 discounts \u2013 for now. Kauai accepts bring-your-own containers for smoothies, but at its standard price.\n\nHowever, it hopes to have a new range of smoothie cups available again \"in coming months\".\n\nThe Kauai-branded reusable coffee cups, which also come with R1 off on every use, are not affected by smoothie cup problem, and remain in use.\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Regular customers of Kauai restaurants stood to get a R1 discount on every smoothie they bought \u2013 plus the satisfaction of reducing plastic waste \u2013 by showing up with special, reusable cups.
