Wolf-Ferrari\u2019s Susanna\u2019s Secret, a witty comedy of manners and misunderstanding, is a work that gets more than an occasional outing; the same cannot be said of Pietro Mascagni\u2019s Zanetto, apparently receiving its Scottish premiere here 120 years after its first performance.\n\nZanetto is a melodrama-tinged piece, not so much a rounded one-act opera as a sketch detailing an encounter between its two characters: Silvia, a worldly-wise courtesan, here played by soprano Sin\u00e9ad Campbell-Wallace, and Zanetto, a carefree travelling minstrel (mezzo Hanna Hipp). In best Brief Encounter fashion, they meet, connect and ultimately go their separate ways. It\u2019s an operatic storm in a teacup; nothing really happens to justify Mascagni\u2019s passionate, overwhelming music, at times reminiscent of his more familiar Cavalleria Rusticana. But it\u2019s easy to sit back and let the swooning melodies overwhelm, especially here given the richly sung performances, Campbell-Wallace\u2019s powerful but burnished soprano sinuously intertwining with Hipp\u2019s seductive darker hues.\n\nSusanna\u2019s Secret is a different work altogether, a frothy comedy-farce about a woman so desperate to hide her nicotine habit from her husband that he thinks she\u2019s having an affair. Clare Presland and Richard Burkhard reprised their roles from Opera Holland Park\u2019s summer production with beguiling vivacity and charm, with Piran Legg showing a droll sense of comic timing in the silent role of the family\u2019s factotum.\n\nDirector Rosie Purdie kept the staging in both minimal \u2013 the hint of an orange grove in Zanetto, a table and chairs and a vase of flowers in Susanna\u2019s Secret \u2013 but it added colour to the performances. Conductor David Parry and the Orchestra of Scottish Opera brought the score to life with energy and enthusiasm, although at times the sound risked being a little overwhelming in the spacious acoustic of St Mary\u2019s.", "description": "Scottish Opera returned to the Lammermuir festival in upbeat form with a pair of contrasting one-act operas", "authors": ["Rowena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7f7bad31e34e53864ae6ee7cf562d79726df09/0_669_4787_2872/master/4787.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5f70409a7cd0b5f0d5944912cb8c976d", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
