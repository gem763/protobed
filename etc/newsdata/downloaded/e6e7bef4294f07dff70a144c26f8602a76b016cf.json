These plans come in two flavors: The traditional, tax-deferred kind, which lets you contribute pre-tax dollars, or a Roth 401(k), which is funded with after-tax dollars but lets you realize tax free growth and retirement income. So if you have both options available to you, which should you choose? Both choices can offer tax advantages, but before you invest, it\u2019s important to learn how they compare and how they serve your financial plan and tax situation.\n\nHow Traditional 401(k) Plans Work\n\nA traditional 401(k) is what you may think of when you think of workplace retirement plans. With this type of retirement account, you make elective salary deferrals into the plan. These deferrals come out before income tax is applied to the money; this lowers your taxable income, effectively acting as an instant tax deduction. The money that\u2019s in your traditional 401(k) grows on a tax-deferred basis. At age 59 1/2, you can begin taking qualified distributions from your plan. Those distributions are subject to ordinary income tax but not the 10% early withdrawal tax penalty.\n\nYour employer can also make matching contributions into the plan. If a match is available, you may have to contribute a certain percentage of your income to get the full match.\n\nFor 2019, employees can contribute up to $19,000 to a traditional 401(k). A catch-up contribution of $6,000 is allowed for workers aged 50 and older. The total amount of contributions allowed, including your contributions and employer matching contributions, is $56,000.\n\nThe investments offered through a traditional 401(k) plan are determined by the plan administrator. Typically, investment options include mutual funds, target-date funds, index funds and exchange-traded funds. Each investment in the plan may have an associated management fee and you may pay administrative fees to the plan as well.\n\nSome 401(k) plans allow employees to take loans and/or hardship withdrawals. Loans must be repaid with interest and if you separate from your employer before the loan is paid in full, the entire amount becomes a taxable distribution. Hardship withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) are taxable and you may also owe the 10% early withdrawal penalty.\n\nHow a Roth 401(k) Works\n\nShould you choose a roth or traditional 401k? More\n\nA Roth 401(k) is similar to a traditional 401(k) in several ways. These plans can be offered by employers alongside or in place of traditional 401(k) plans.\n\nYou make contributions to the plan, which your employer can match. The biggest difference, however, is that you\u2019re putting after-tax dollars into a Roth 401(k), versus pre-tax dollars with a traditional 401(k).\n\nWhat that means for you from a tax perspective is that once you begin taking qualified distributions from your Roth account, those withdrawals (including any returns your contributions earned over the years) would be 100% tax-free. So while you don\u2019t get to reduce your taxable income in the year you make the contribution, you get to enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. That\u2019s particularly beneficial to you if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket at retirement and want to minimize your tax liability on your retirement income.\n\nEmployer contributions made on your behalf would still be directed into a pre-tax (tax-deferred) account.\n\nWhat About Required Minimum Distributions?\n\nShould you choose a roth or traditional 401k?
