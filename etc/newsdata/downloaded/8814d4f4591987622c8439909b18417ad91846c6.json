Samsung is making some big changes on these laptops, both inside and out. There are the expected boosts in specs, of course, as well as very welcome redesigns that bring the two models more in line with the modern design language that Samsung introduced earlier this year with the Notebook 9 Pro.\n\nThe new Galaxy Books are Samsung\u2019s first laptops to use QLED displays, which is the same display tech that the company uses on its line of high-end flat-screen TVs. Samsung says they should be brighter (with a maximum of 600 nitts using a special \u201cOutdoor Mode\u201d and up to 400 nitts regularly) and more color accurate than before.\n\nBoth laptops also feature Intel\u2019s latest 10th Gen chips: the convertible Galaxy Book Flex has 10nm Ice Lake processors, while the Galaxy Book Ion will have the 14nm Comet Lake chipsets based on the older architecture. Both laptops (in their 13- and 15-inch sizes) are certified as part of Intel\u2019s Project Athena program, meaning you should get up to nine hours of real-world battery life.\n\nThe touchpad is now a wireless charger\n\nThe third big change is the inclusion of a new Wireless PowerShare touchpad that doubles as a full-fledged Qi wireless charger for any of your wirelessly charging gadgets. It\u2019s an admittedly odd feature: you have to first enable the wireless charging mode with a keyboard combination, so it\u2019s not as simple as just dropping your phone on top of the pad. And when you\u2019re charging a device, you can\u2019t use the touchpad at all, which limits the functionality of your laptop (unless you have an external mouse handy). Given that the rest of the laptops are made out of metal, the glass trackpad was the only place to put it. Plus, if you do desperately need to charge your Galaxy Watch Active 2 or AirPods, you\u2019ll have the option.\n\nLastly, there are some changes to the S Pen that is included with the Galaxy Book Flex. It now has similar Air Action gestures to the Galaxy Note 10, allowing you to control your laptop with motion gestures using the stylus.\n\nAs for the actual designs, they\u2019re big improvements on the old models. Like the Notebook 9 Pro, they\u2019re all-metal designs, but Samsung\u2019s ancient design style has finally been given the axe. Compare the new Galaxy Book Flex against the Notebook 9 Pen from last year, and it\u2019s no contest. The bubbly-looking curved and corners are replaced with the sharper edges that it introduced earlier this year. There\u2019s also far smaller screen bezels, which helps reduce the overall size of the laptop.\n\nBetter yet, Samsung has actually improved on its first attempt with these models. Where the Notebook 9 Pro looked like a MacBook Pro rip-off, the new Galaxy Book Flex, with its striking blue hues, finally looks like its own unique product.\n\nSimilarly, the non-touchscreen Galaxy Book Ion looks to stand out with a cleverly raised design that sees the back of the display prop up the keyboard slightly when opened. There\u2019s also a nice blue accent strip on the back that helps it stand out from the crowd.\n\nAs for the rest of the specs: both laptops will come in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes, with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB NVMe SSDs. (Although, as noted before, the folding Flex laptops will have Intel\u2019s newer 10nm processors.) The 15-inch models will also have optional Nvidia MX250 external GPUs, although Samsung has yet to announce exact configurations for any of the laptops just yet.\n\nGrid View Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Alix Diaconis / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Alix Diaconis / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Alix Diaconis / The Ver\n\nPhoto by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge\n\nThere\u2019s no word on pricing, although Samsung says that prices should be within the same ballpark as the Notebook 9 Pen and Notebook 9 clamshell laptops that the new models will replace.\n\nMore curious is the release date, or lack thereof: Samsung only gave an \u201cearly 2020\u201d window, which is puzzlingly far away from today\u2019s announcement. Samsung also missed another Galaxy Book release date recently: the company\u2019s ARM-powered Galaxy Book S was originally supposed to ship in September, and we still have no release date almost two months later.\n\nPhotography by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge", "description": "Samsung has a pair of new laptops \u2014 the Galaxy Book Flex and Galaxy Book Ion \u2014 that will replace the company\u2019s old Samsung Notebook 9 Pen and Notebook 9 models, respectively.
