China's top trade envoy, Liu He, will lead a delegation to resume trade talks with U.S. officials in Washington on Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged the U.S. to withdraw its move against the Chinese firms, and said, \"China will continue to take firm and strong measures to uphold its national sovereignty, our security and development interests.\"\n\nChina's recent large purchases from the U.S. soybean market had signaled a potential thaw in relations. But China has also sought to narrow the scope of the trade negotiations, putting aside national-security issues and adding to market concerns that an immediate resolution is unlikely.\n\n\"They will not reach an agreement at any price,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at London Capital Group. \"Despite the optimism we see, there's a chance this week ends with another disappointment.\"\n\nShares in Domino's Pizza Inc. lost 4.2% after the chain pizza restaurant said that sales growth may be slower than previously expected.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.8%, with its banking sector down 1.5%. The German DAX fell 0.9%.\n\nShares in London Stock Exchange Group fell 5.6% after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing pulled a $36.6 billion bid for its London rival, a deal that would have united two major trading hubs.\n\nGerman industrial output grew slightly in August, according to official data. The rise was a surprise after a dismal reading on Monday of manufacturing orders for the same month.\n\nIndustrial output increased 0.3% in August over July in adjusted terms, the statistical office said. Despite the better-than-expected output, the industry remains in a downturn, the Ministry of Economics said.\n\nThe British pound also stumbled on political headwinds Tuesday, falling 0.6% against the euro and down 0.5% against the U.S. dollar, amid increased skepticism a Brexit deal could be reached at the European Union Council of State next week, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading firm IG Group.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was trying to win a blame game over Brexit.\n\n\"It seems like the options are a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all, and that's likely to be what the election comes down to,\" said Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG Group.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year German bund edged down to minus 0.594%, according to Tradeweb, from minus 0.572% Monday afternoon. The yield on 10-year Treasurys also edged down to 1.516%, from 1.552% on Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude fell 1% to $57.73 a barrel, and gold gained 0.5%.\n\nThe Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, both viewed as havens, gained 0.3% against the dollar.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 1% and Korea's Kospi gained 1.2%.
