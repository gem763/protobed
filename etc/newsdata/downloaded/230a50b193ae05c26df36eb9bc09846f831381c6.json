A rare 13th century painting by Italian master Cimabue has been found in a French kitchen, and is now expected to fetch millions of euros at an upcoming auction.\n\nA rare painting from the Italian master Cimabue was found hanging in the kitchen of a woman outside Paris, local media reported.\n\n\"Christ Mocked,\" a work by the 13th century pre-Renaissance painter, was part of a larger display and could be valued between $4.4 to 6.6 million, art expert \u00c9ric Turquin told French newspaper Le Figaro.\n\nThe painting was found in the town of Compi\u00e8gne after an auctioneer saw the work, which the woman had hung directly above a hotplate, and told her to have it appraised, said Stephane Pinta, a painting specialist with the Turquin gallery in Paris. The woman had thought the work was just an old religious work, the French news agency AFP reported.\n\nThe painting, about 8 inches by 11 inches, was part of a diptych that was broken up and included eight scenes from the Passsion of the Christ, Le Figaro reported. Two other sections, painted around 1280, are displayed at the Frick Collection in New York and the National Gallery in London.\n\n'Indiana Jones of art': $28 million Picasso, stolen 20 years ago, recovered\n\nTurquin told the AFP that art historians used infrared light to analyze the work and determined that there was \"no disputing that the painting was done by the same hand\" as Cimabue's other work.\n\nThe painting is slated to be auctioned Oct. 27 at the Acteon auction house in Senlis, France.\n\nAccording to Le Figaro, none of Cimabue's paintings have ever been auctioned.\n\nThe Florentine painter, also known as Cenni di Pepo, was hugely influential just before the Italian Renaissance began, and art journal The Art Newspaper described him as \"the father of Western painting.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.
