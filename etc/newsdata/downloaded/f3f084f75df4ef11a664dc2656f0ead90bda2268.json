Tunisia is thought to have the biggest contingent.\n\nOfficials in Paris say 60 to 70 French nationals are among those held.\n\nThe rest are around 4,000 Syrians and roughly the same number of Iraqis.\n\nThe fighters, who were detained mostly in the course of operations led by Kurdish forces and backed by the US-led coalition against IS, are detained in at least seven facilities.\n\nWestern governments such as France have been reluctant to take them back, for lack of a clear legal framework and fears of a public backlash.\n\nLe Drian said Wednesday that the security of Kurdish-run prisons holding suspected jihadists in northern Syria was \u201ccurrently\u201d not threatened by the Turkish military operation.", "description": "France's top diplomat held talks in Baghdad on Thursday about transferring foreign jihadists from northern Syria.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/French-Foreign-Minister-Jean-Yves-Le-Drian.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
