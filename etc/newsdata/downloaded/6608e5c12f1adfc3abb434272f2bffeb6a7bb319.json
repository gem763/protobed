And with no viable challengers to the status quo, incumbent lenders had little reason to overhaul this process.\n\nBut Quicken Loans turned the mortgage industry on its head with the introduction of Rocket Mortgage, an online mortgage application that takes less than 10 minutes to complete, in November 2015. Its product simplified the mortgage process by offering a clean and quick online application form, allowing online information verification, and providing conditional preapproval within minutes. And in Q4 2017, Quicken became the largest US residential mortgage originator by volume, surpassing Wells Fargo for the first time.\n\nRocket Mortgage helped validate the digital mortgage sector and bring a number of other alternative online mortgage lenders to the fore. We've seen players like Lenda (now Reali Loans) move into mortgage purchases around the time Rocket Mortgage was introduced and better.com launch its online mortgage offering early in 2016, for instance.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nAnd while big banks have seen their share of the market shrink since the 2008 financial crisis, they can now unlock the potential of advanced mortgage tech to act against the threat of nonbanks and alt lenders and claw back some of that lost market share.\n\nAnd some large FIs, including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BofA), SunTrust, and TD Bank, have already unveiled their own digital mortgage lending platforms that help them enhance the customer experience, shave down costs \u2014 by cutting labor expenses or reducing the possibility of fraud, for example \u2014 and drive a more significant opportunity in residential mortgages.\n\nIn this report, Business Insider Intelligence will examine the current state of the mortgage lending landscape and how technology has enabled alt lenders to transform the home loan process from application to closing.
