Also on Tuesday, German automaker Daimler AG agreed to pay 870 million euros in fines connected to a separate investigation of diesel emissions cheating.\n\nEmanuele Palma, a senior manager of diesel drivability and emissions at Fiat Chrysler, faces charges of conspiracy, fraud, violating federal environmental law and making false statements stemming from work on Fiat Chrysler's emissions system in U.S. vehicles with diesel engines, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday.\n\nPalma, a 40-year-old Italian citizen, was arrested by the FBI Tuesday morning at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. In the afternoon, he appeared before a federal judge in Detroit in shackles, a hooded sweatshirt and sweatpants. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford released him on a $10,000 unsecured bond and ordered him to surrender his passport.\n\nProsecutors argued Palma represented a \"significant flight risk\" and sought unsuccessfully to have him placed under GPS monitoring. Palma's lawyer, Kenneth Mogill, argued his client has family in the Detroit area and is cooperating with prosecutors.\n\nThe indictment describes what it refers to as a \"scheme\" to use sophisticated software tricks to deceive regulators about the emissions performance of diesel engines offered in Ram pickup trucks and Jeep sport-utility vehicles.\n\nPalma led a team of engineers who developed diesel engines and calibrated them with software allowing the vehicles to pollute less when undergoing government testing and more when driven on roads, U.S. officials said.\n\nAfter the disclosure of Volkswagen's emissions fraud in September 2015, the indictment states that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asked Fiat Chrysler for more testing of its diesel vehicles. In November 2015, the EPA warned Fiat Chrysler that it suspected some of its vehicles were using secret software to defeat emissions tests.\n\nThe indictment charges that months later, in a June 2016 meeting, Palma \"personally provided false and misleading representations\" to regulators.\n\nBefore 2016, Palma worked for VM Motori SpA, a diesel engine manufacturer that was 50% owned by Fiat Chrysler until 2013, when it purchased the remainder of the company.\n\nFiat Chrysler, which has previously denied purposefully attempting to evade emissions requirements, said in a statement it would \"continue to fully cooperate with the authorities, as we have throughout this issue\" and declined to comment further.\n\n\"The indictment in this case should signal to corporations and individuals working for them that there are significant consequences for attempting to bypass U.S. emissions tests and defraud the American people,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Steven M. D'Antuono of the FBI\u2019s Detroit Field Office in statement.\n\nFiat Chrysler's U.S.-listed shares <FCAU.N> lost 3 percent to $13 on Tuesday. Milan-listed shared closed down 2 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSETTLED CIVIL CLAIMS\n\nThe developments in the U.S. criminal probe signal additional scrutiny of Fiat Chrysler's environmental practices on the horizon, despite the automaker's January settlement of civil claims stemming from the alleged emissions violations.\n\nFiat Chrysler agreed to pay about $800 million to resolve civil claims from the Justice Department, state officials and customers alleging the company installed illegal software allowing more than 100,000 diesel-powered vehicles to dupe government emissions tests and then pollute beyond legal limits on the road.\n\nStory continues", "description": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A grand jury indicted a senior manager at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA)  on charges he lied to regulators about diesel emissions, alleging the deception continued even after a scandal over cheating on government environmental tests had engulfed rival Volkswagen AG", "authors": ["Mike Spector", "David Shepardson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fYqIKRjgr72foqyqriyRuw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/40e20100525da7bd750ca4a0ab056488", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
