Sulzberger wrote that in 2017 one of the paper\u2019s reporters, Declan Walsh, was facing \u201cimminent arrest\u201d by government officials in Egypt. While such calls are alarming, Sulzberger said they\u2019re standard for the paper, which has hundreds of reporters working in more than 160 countries. Under President Donald Trump, however, things took a shocking turn when an unnamed diplomat called Times leadership.\n\n\u201cThis particular call took a surprising and distressing turn,\u201d Sulzberger wrote. \u201cWe learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger.\u201d\n\nRead the full editorial over at The New York Times.\n\nThe publisher continued to note that rather than counting on the U.S. government to help protect Walsh from arrest, the Times instead reached out to Irish diplomats, who were at the reporter\u2019s home within an hour and escorted him onto a flight before he could be detained (Walsh is Irish).\n\n\u201cThose of us leading The Times find it hard not to worry, knowing we have colleagues on the ground where war is raging, disease is spreading and conditions deteriorating,\u201d Sulzberger continued. \u201cBut we\u2019ve long taken comfort in knowing that in addition to all our own preparations and all our own safeguards, there has always been another, critical safety net: the United States government, the world\u2019s greatest champion of the free press. Over the last few years, however, something has dramatically changed.\u201d\n\nAfter the editorial was published, many in the media called it \u201cstunning\u201d and \u201cchilling.\u201d\n\nA.G. Sulzberger of @nytimes says \u201clet me tell you a story I\u2019ve never shared publicly before.\u201d That story and one other raise unsettling questions about how the US government might respond when American journalists are under threat overseas. https://t.co/4HvKCq2SCk \u2014 Marty Baron (@PostBaron) September 24, 2019\n\nIt is stunning >>> https://t.co/rU87AmeEBF \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 24, 2019\n\nThe Trump administration has for years waged an information war against the American media, moving to cast the free press as \u201cfake news\u201d as soon as a newspaper or television network releases a story critical of the president. The Times notes Trump has used the phrase \u201cfake news\u201d more than 600 times on Twitter and said many other countries with far fewer protections for the press have since taken up the slogan.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I recently researched the spread of the phrase \u2018fake news,\u2019 and what we found is deeply alarming: In the past few years, more than 50 prime ministers, presidents and other government leaders across five continents have used the term \u2018fake news\u2019 to justify varying levels of anti-press activity,\u201d Sulzberger wrote.\n\nThe shift in terminology has already had real-world consequences, including the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the directive of the Saudi government. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 252 reporters were imprisoned last year for doing their jobs. And 16 have already been killed in 2019.\n\nSulzberger said Turmp\u2019s disregard for the First Amendment has effectively \u201cgiven foreign leaders permission to do the same.\u201d But he issued a call for Americans and those abroad to work to protect journalism at a time when it\u2019s needed most.\n\n\u201cThe true power of a free press is an informed, engaged citizenry. I believe in independent journalism and want it to thrive. I believe in this country and its values, and I want us to live up to them and offer them as a model for a freer and more just world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe United States has done more than any other country to popularize the idea of free expression and to champion the rights of the free press. The time has come for us to fight for those ideals again.\u201d", "description": "A.G.
