(\u201cIBC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V: IB; OTCQB: IAALF) announces its financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended June 30, 2019. Print versions of IBC's financial statements and MD&A can be seen here.\n\nThe Company generated revenue in fiscal year (\u201cFY\u201d) 2019 of $18.7 million, which compares to revenue of $19.4 million in FY 2018. IBC booked a comprehensive loss (net of tax) in FY 2019 of $4.0 million, or $0.11 per share, from a comprehensive loss of $700,000, or $0.02 per share, for FY 2018.\n\nIBC\u2019s loss in 2019 was largely driven by (1) lower-than-expected revenue in fiscal Q2 2019 in the Copper Alloys Division, caused by an industry-wide reduction in demand in copper alloy products in the quarter, and (2) lower-than-normal demand throughout most of 2019 for beryllium-aluminum (\u201cBeAl\u201d) alloy products used by semiconductor equipment manufacturers, which followed several consecutive record-breaking years of sales to that sector.\n\nHowever, customer demand for copper alloy products returned to more normal levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2019, and demand and orders are trending higher so far in fiscal 2020. In the Company\u2019s Engineered Materials Division, demand for BeAl products used in commercial applications also is strengthening from the lows of 2019, as underscored by the Company\u2019s signing in October 2019 of a two-year supply agreement with a leading global manufacturer of semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment and by the fact that the Company has now moved to initial production of BeAl parts for a major satellite manufacturer.\n\nDemand for BeAl products used in defense applications remained steady in 2019 but is expected to strengthen as rates of production for defense programs such as the F-35 Lightning II aircraft begin to accelerate beyond low rates of initial production. For example, according to Lockheed Martin, the annual rate of production of the F-35 aircraft is expected to increase by 65% from 2018, when IBC signed a three-year supply agreement, to 2021.\n\nPlanned F-35 Aircraft Production is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a93373d8-7860-4cb9-b9e3-842fe56422af\n\n\u201c2019 was a challenging year for IBC, largely due to industry-wide downturns in both copper and beryllium-aluminum alloy markets,\u201d said Mark A. Smith, Chairman of the IBC Board. \u201cHowever, we have been pleased to see demand and orders rising in both operating divisions over the past several months and I expect to see those trends continuing into fiscal 2020, particularly as Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 program starts to migrate to higher rates of annual production and we begin production of new components at our Engineered Materials division.\u201d\n\nFISCAL 2019 SEGMENT AND CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS RESULTS\n\nA summary of the Company\u2019s results for FY 2019 and Q4 2019, on a consolidated and segment-by-segment basis, of operations to loss before other items (\u201coperating income (loss)\u201d) follows:\n\nFiscal 2019 Segment and Consolidated Operations Results are available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c81ca868-6b03-4ea5-bdd0-a686be2e36ce\n\nFiscal Q4 2019 Segment and Consolidated Operations Results are available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b770d881-bca1-4336-b0a3-7c7e26851682\n\nSELECTED ANNUAL INFORMATION\n\n($000 except $ per share) June 30 2019 2018 2017 Revenue ($000) 18,668 19,399 15,715 Profit / Loss ($000) (4,043 ) (702 ) (5,362 ) Profit / Loss per share, basic and diluted ($ per share) (0.11 ) (0.02 ) (0.18 ) Total Assets 17,814 20,295 14,897 Long-term Financial Liabilities 1,847 1,769 213\n\nEVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2019\n\nFollowing June 30, 2019, IBC reported these subsequent events:\n\nIn October 2019, we secured a renewal of our existing line of credit and term loan facility with BMO. The renewal of both the BMO line of credit and term loan facility extends until September 30, 2020. Approximately $3 million is available to the Company under the line of credit, and the term loan has a maximum of approximately $1.2 million.\n\n\n\nIn October 2019, we signed a two-year supply agreement with a leading global manufacturer of semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment under which IBC will supply Beralcast\u00ae 363 cast components in multiple design configurations over a two-year period.\n\n\n\nIn August 2019, we received new orders of high-performance beryllium-aluminum alloy parts made from IBC\u2019s proprietary Beralcast \u00ae material from a leading global manufacturer of semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment. Orders for calendar fourth quarter 2019, made under an existing exclusive supply agreement between IBC and the semiconductor assembly equipment manufacturer, were valued at approximately $400,000.\n\n\n\nmaterial from a leading global manufacturer of semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment. Orders for calendar fourth quarter 2019, made under an existing exclusive supply agreement between IBC and the semiconductor assembly equipment manufacturer, were valued at approximately $400,000. On July 22, 2019, we issued 737,059 common shares to debentures holders with an issue-date value of C$161,000 in satisfaction of the June 30, 2019 interest payment in lieu of cash.\n\n\n\nOn July 7, 2019, we issued 304,671 common shares for services to directors of the Company, 101,557 common shares for services to a consultant and 185,000 common shares for options exercised by a director of the Company.\n\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\n\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS, IBC uses \u201coperating income (loss)\u201d and \u201coperating profit,\u201d which are non-IFRS financial measures. IBC believes that operating income and operating profit help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that IBC includes in loss for the period. IBC recently achieved operating profitability for the first time in years and further believes that operating income (loss) and operating profit provide useful information about core operating results, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Operating income (loss) and operating profit should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the period or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of IBC\u2019s operating performance. Operating income (loss) and operating profit presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.\n\nOperating income (loss) represents loss for the period, excluding foreign exchange loss, interest expense, loss on disposal of assets, interest income, other income (expense), arbitration award liability and income taxes that IBC does not believe are reflective of the core operating performance during the periods presented.\n\nOperating income (loss)\n\nA reconciliation of the income (loss) for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 to operating income (loss) follows:\n\nPeriod Ended June 30 2019 2018 $ $ Loss for the period (1,550 ) (240 ) Foreign exchange loss 56 3 Interest expense 217 110 Loss on disposal of assets - - Interest income - (1 ) Other income (expense) (10 ) (6 ) Income taxes (10 ) (1 ) Operating income (loss)1 (1,297 ) 345\n\n1Difference in operating loss for fourth quarter 2019 is due to rounding.\n\nYear Ended June 30 2019 2018 $ $ Loss for the period (4,043 ) (702 ) Foreign exchange loss 49 52 Interest expense 925 286 Loss on disposal of assets 20 - Interest income (7 ) (2 ) Other income (expense) (22 ) (14 ) Income taxes (recovery) expense (4 ) 11 Operating loss (3,082 ) (369 )\n\nFor more information on IBC and its innovative alloy products, go here .\n\n\n\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors:\n\n\"Mark A.
