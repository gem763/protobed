From the health care field to academia, temp workers are a growing segment of the American workforce, often earning lower pay and fewer, if any, benefits compared with colleagues in permanent positions.\n\nWhile a temporary workforce can help boost the corporate bottom line, enabling businesses to cut costs and have more flexibility, it can be a bad deal for workers, according to labor experts, who say it holds back those people who want a permanent slot and are struggling to make ends meet, and those who have secured positions but believe they have less leverage to demand better wages in a changing jobs market.\n\nRobin Gary is an adjunct professor teaching courses in sociology, poverty and social justice class at Elon University in NC.

That was in comparison to 1,758,700 jobs in that category during the same month in 2009.\n\nBut that figure doesn't include the many temporary workers who are hired directly by businesses rather than through agencies. There is no official broader estimate of how many Americans hold temporary jobs, but their numbers include seasonal hires by retailers during the holiday season, and adjunct professors who are typically hired directly by colleges, but lack a track to tenure or a permanent position.\n\nIn 2017, 45% of instructional faculty at colleges nationwide were adjuncts, according to the Service Employees International Union.\n\nThat's in comparison to five decades ago, when more than 78% of college and university faculty had tenure or were on the tenure track, according to William Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College in New York.", "description": "The GM-UAW strike highlights the rise of temp workers, which are also a growing segment of the workforce in health care and academia.", "authors": ["Charisse Jones", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R1tZza6hDCzJrCHWJNfBKw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/86bb5cde06e7074bd3a02acf1f771ad6", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
