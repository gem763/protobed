This year, the extent of Arctic sea ice was the second-lowest ever recorded.\n\nPolar ice melt contributes to sea-level rise and also leads the planet to heat up faster, since ice reflects sunlight back into space.\n\nAn organization called Ice911 has proposed scattering tiny, glass spheres across parts of the Arctic to reflect more sunlight back into space and slow the thaw.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe Arctic is melting at unprecedented rates: Greenland's ice is disappearing six times faster than it was four decades ago. In August, the ice sheet lost 60 billion tons in just 5 days of summer thaw.\n\nOver the last four decades, we've lost 75% of the volume of Arctic ice. The current extent of the sea ice is the second-lowest it's been since scientists started keeping track in 1979.\n\nIn addition to raising sea levels, this melting significantly contributes to climate change because Arctic ice reflects sunlight into space (in part because sea ice is bright and white). So less ice means less heat leaving the planet, which in turn leads more ice to melt. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nA nonprofit called Ice911 offers a potential solution to this ominous feedback loop: The group has proposed blanketing key parts of the Arctic in millions of hollow, glass microspheres to form a protective layer that reflects sunlight and insulates melting ice.\n\n\"We're an awfully creative species, and we need to slow the climate-change clock,\" Leslie Field, the founder of Ice911, told Business Insider. \"Technology like this gives us time to act.\"\n\nTiny silica beads at work\n\nThe tiny spheres Ice911 has developed look more like grains of sand than beads. They're manufactured from silica, a compound made of silicon and oxygen, because the material is abundant in the natural world and harmless to humans and animals.\n\nIce911 More\n\nCourtesy of Susan Kramer/Ice 911\n\nField described the microspheres as \"small, fine, white beach sand\" that floats. In a sense, the material is a lot like snow.\n\nThe reflective beads stick to ice and water on contact, and their chemical composition ensures they don't attract oil-based pollutants. Simulations done by Ice911 suggest that using the technology to restore ice reflectivity could help lower temperatures by 1.5 degrees Celsius over a large part of the northern Arctic.\n\nBut so far, the technology is still in the field-test phase. Field said Ice911 started with \"a very small experiment in buckets\" on the deck of her own home, then conducted small tests at a lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains and a pond in Minnesota.\n\nIn the last two years, Field and her colleagues have brought the microspheres to the Arctic, where they spread the material over a frozen lake near Utqia\u0121vik (Barrow), Alaska. The results, some of which were reported in a May 2018 study, suggest the silica beads did indeed increase ice reflectivity and thickness.", "description": "The Arctic is melting faster than ever.
