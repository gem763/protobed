We have seen a definite increase in the suicide rate and depression in farmers in the U.S.\u201d\n\nFarm help organization Farm Aid reported a 30% increase last year in calls to its hotline last year.\n\nThe calls and \u201cour work with partners around the country confirm that farmers are under incredible financial, legal and emotional stress. Bankruptcies, foreclosures, depression and even suicide are some of the tragic consequences of these pressures,\u201d said a statement from the organization.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s family farmers \u2014 reduced in numbers since the farm crisis of the 1980s \u2014 have approached endangered status. ... anxious farm families ... cannot make ends meet, and ... will not be able to improve their situation simply by working harder. Confusion and lack of resolution on policies like trade, immigration and healthcare accelerate the crisis.\u201d\n\nMatt Rossman, a therapist who helps suicidal farmers, blames the stresses of surviving on the land for farmers who can\u2019t take it any more. Low farm prices, the \u201cprolonged recession in agriculture,\u201d flooding \u2014 and the Trump administration, are all causing problems, he wrote in an April column in The New Republic. \u201cFarmers are becoming dismayed about the tariffs.\u201d\n\nA Morning Consult and American Farm Federation research poll published in April found that 91% of farmers and farmworkers said financial issues are impacting their mental health. About 87% of those surveyed said they fear losing their farms.\n\nEven before the current crisis, a new comprehensive survey published this month covering the years from 1999 to 2016 found that the rate of suicide among Americans ages 25 to 64 rose by 41 percent in that time, researchers reported in JAMA Network Open. Rates among those living in rural counties were 25 percent higher than people in major metropolitan areas.\n\nResearchers link the increase to poverty, lower incomes and underemployment. \u201cThose factors are really bad in rural areas,\u201d study author Danielle Steelesmith, a postdoctoral fellow at Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center, told NBC.\n\nThe study also found that counties with high levels of social fragmentation \u2014 based on the levels of single-person households, unmarried residents and transient residents \u2014 and a high percentage of veterans had higher rates of suicide. All of those factors were more pronounced in rural counties.", "description": "Mounting financial stress is linked to grim tally in rural America.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d74c0702400001b2677c6e5.jpeg?cache=hovg2ronzf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
