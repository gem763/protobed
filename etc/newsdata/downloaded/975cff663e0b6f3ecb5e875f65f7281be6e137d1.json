I\u2019m due to fly in the afternoon, and am feeling upset and stressed about it.\n\nDavid T\n\nA Starting at 3am on Friday 13 September, a group of climate activists intends to fly a swarm of drones within the exclusion zone of Heathrow airport.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

So it is understandable that the 220,000-plus passengers booked to fly to or from Britain\u2019s biggest airport on that day are worried about disruption \u2013 along with travellers booked on subsequent days, because the protesters plan a campaign lasting at least two weeks.\n\nThe protesters, who call themselves Heathrow Pause, say: \u201cThe planned nonviolent direct action \u2026 is designed to highlight the grave risk of airport expansion during the climate and ecological emergency.\u201d They will tell Heathrow an hour in advance that, for example, \u201ca drone might be flown at around head height in a public park in West Drayton\u201d. They anticipate that all departures will be halted, and presumably expect arriving flights to be diverted to other airports.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Heathrow Pause says it will put \u201cstringent safety measures and protocols in place\u201d to prevent causing any actual danger to airline passengers. But the Metropolitan Police is concerned the drone protest could be exploited by a terrorist group. So there will be an extremely heavy security presence in and around the airport on Friday. Heathrow says: \u201cWe will continue to work closely with the police to mitigate the impact of their illegal action and ensure that the airport operates safely.\u201d\n\nNo airline has cancelled flights to or from Heathrow as a result of the drone protest, and I predict that 13 September will prove to be just another busy Friday. If I am wrong, though, bear in mind that Europe\u2019s air passengers\u2019 rights rules mean the airline must provide an alternative flight as soon as possible, and provide meals and, if necessary, accommodation until you can get where you planned to be.\n\nEmail your question to s@hols.tv or tweet @simoncalder", "description": "Q\u00a0How likely is the drone protest on Friday to ground flights?
