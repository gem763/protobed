It allows more width in the team than we\u2019ve had,\u2019 the Norwegian said.\n\n\u2018Of course, it\u2019s a risk when you play with three at the back against their front three, which is a great front three. But it\u2019s a risk we had to take.\n\n\u2018We did it to create chances for ourselves. I thought the goal was the perfect example of how we wanted the game to pan out.\u2019\n\nSolskjaer added: \u2018We\u2019re better when we attack quickly \u2013 no dilly-dallying on the ball. Play the ball forward \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be a counter attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I spoke about it before the game: take more risks, be braver. It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose the ball up there because you can win it back.\n\n\u2018In the Champions League final, Liverpool got a penalty after 40 seconds from hooking the ball in behind [off a player\u2019s arm].\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about playing the right type of football and playing direct helped us.\u2019\n\nMORE: Manchester United chief Ed Woodward slams notion he picks transfers by watching YouTube", "description": "Jesse Lingard has returned to training ahead of Manchester United's Europa League clash with Partizan, but there was no sign of David de Gea during Wednesday's session.
