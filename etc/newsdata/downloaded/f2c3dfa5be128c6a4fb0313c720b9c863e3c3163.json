The average family spends \u00a360.60 a week on their food shop, according to figures from the ONS. Its 'family spending in the UK' report found that households spent \u00a3242.40 on groceries and non-alcoholic drinks each month. This equates to \u00a32,908.80 per year. The ONS collected data from April 2017 to March 2018 from speaking to 11,689 households across the UK.\n\nTesco chief customer officer Alessandra Bellini said: 'New Clubcard Plus is a breakthrough innovation giving customers even more ways to get the best value while shopping at Tesco, for their everyday essentials, weekly shops, mobile and banking.'\n\nTo see if the Clubcard Plus is worth the money, This is Money calculated potential savings for customers purchasing two big shops a month.\n\nIt found that, for those spending \u00a350 or over a month, the savings could be big but for anyone who is likely to spend under that, the card is probably not worth the money.\n\nDetails on the rest of the scheme are fairly limited so those looking to sign up will have to keep their eyes peeled for more information.\n\nTesco first launched Clubcard in 1995 and re-launched it in 2018 with contactless cards, an improved app and more rewards partners.\n\nThe supermarket also launched Faster Vouchers that allows customers to get their vouchers quickly by downloading them into the Clubcard app.\n\nAs part of its centenary celebrations, it then created Clubcard Prices - whereby Clubcard holders are offered lower prices.\n\nTESCO CLUBCARD PLUS SAVINGS Value of shop 10% saving on two shops Annual savings Savings after Clubcard Plus\n\ncost is deducted \u00a325 \u00a35 \u00a360 -\u00a335.88 \u00a350 \u00a310 \u00a3120 \u00a324.12 \u00a375 \u00a315 \u00a3180 \u00a384.12 \u00a3100 \u00a320 \u00a3240 \u00a3144.12 \u00a3125 \u00a325 \u00a3300 \u00a3204.12 \u00a3150 \u00a330 \u00a3360 \u00a3264.12\n\nNectar card changes\n\nTesco Clubcard is not the only loyalty scheme that has undertaken changes recently.\n\nNectar has recently revealed they are also making some alterations, announcing a 'full digitisation' of the scheme.\n\nUnder the changes, card holders will now be sent a range of offers, via the Nectar app and website, which have been tailored to their shopping habits.\n\nThese deals are aimed to boost points, as well as allow shoppers to earn points for pounds spent.\n\nAn all new 'digital Nectar card' will also be available to scan at the till via the app to enable customers to scan their phone in Sainsbury's and at Esso instead of carrying a plastic card.\n\nNectar has updated its scheme to become 'fully digitised' and is already available to customers\n\nThis new scheme has already started so those who want to start reaping the rewards will have to update or download the app as this is where they will be able to view all their points.\n\nJames Moir, managing director of Nectar said: 'We're delighted to be unveiling a new world of Nectar to our customers, making it easier than ever before for them to get the most out of our hundreds of partners and rewards on offer.\n\n'During the trials in Wales and the Isle of Wight, we listened to what our customers wanted and how they like to receive offers, in an increasingly digitised world.\n\n'This led us to a change in direction for the Nectar scheme, enabling our customers to have a much more personalised experience with offers that are completely unique to them.'\n\nPoints can be spent with a wide range of partners and online retailers covering entertainment, travel, food and drink, and experiences.", "description": "Available for new and existing customers, card holders will have to pay \u00a37.99 a month for which they will receive up to four benefits each month, including 10 per cent off two 'big shops' in-store.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
