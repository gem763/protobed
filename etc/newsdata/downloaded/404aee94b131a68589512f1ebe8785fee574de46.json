(Umit Bektas/Reuters)\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government on Wednesday formally pulled the extradition bill that ignited months of violent pro-democracy protests.\n\n\u201cI formally announce the withdrawal of the bill,\u201d Secretary for Security John Lee announced to the Chinese territory\u2019s legislature, citing \u201cconflicts in society\u201d as his justification.\n\nHong Kong has been roiled by protests throughout the summer, originally sparked by outrage over the extradition law, which Hong Kong residents say would allow Chinese authorities to effectively \u201ckidnap\u201d them with little evidence of criminality.\n\nHowever, the concern over the law has ballooned into fear that China plans to throw out its \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d policy regarding Hong Kong \u2014 and the withdrawal of the bill is unlikely to curb the protests.\n\nChina has vowed a \u201csevere\u201d response to the protests and has accused demonstrators of terrorism.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced last month that the extradition bill would be withdrawn. The protesters have since made several other broader demands including enhanced democracy for Hong Kong, an independent investigation into police conduct, and amnesty for protesters who have been arrested.", "description": "Hong Kong residents said the extradition law would allow Chinese authorities to effectively \u201ckidnap\u201d them with little evidence of criminality.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
