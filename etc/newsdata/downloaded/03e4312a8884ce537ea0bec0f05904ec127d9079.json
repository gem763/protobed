The last time Verlander took the bump, he dazzled with 12 strikeouts through six innings against the Angels. Expect nothing more than another quality start with punchout upside and plenty of run support this afternoon.\n\nAlso Consider: Jack Flaherty, Clayton Kershaw\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMitch Garver - Minnesota (at New York Yankees)\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance Garver will man the leadoff spot for Minnesota, as that has been the Twins\u2019 strategy against left-handed pitching throughout most of the season. Either way, the Minnesota catcher finds himself in a position to thrive while facing New York LHP James Paxton, who has been vulnerable against right-handed bats at times this season. Garver has enjoyed a breakout season while hitting .273 with 31 homers alongside an amazing 198 wRC+ and .468 wOBA while facing left-handed pitching.\n\nAlso Consider: Paul Goldschmidt, Gary Sanchez\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nKolten Wong - St. Louis (at Atlanta)\n\nWong should retain a premium lineup spot for the Cardinals, and he came through with a solid 2-4 outing (2B, 2 RBIs) in yesterday\u2019s victory. Atlanta RHP Mike Foltynewicz has been up-and-down throughout most of this season, and St. Louis checks in with the second-highest scoring projection of this slate (only trailing NYY). The opportunity cost at second base is pretty low, and Wong makes for an easy bargain lift within that.\n\nAlso Consider: Jose Altuve, Max Muncy\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nMiguel Sano - Minnesota (at New York Yankees)\n\nThis Twins-Yankees matchup features the two best HR-hitting teams in the history of baseball, so we could have a wildly inflated score tonight. Sano is another Minnesota power bat who feasts on left-handed pitching with a 157 wRC+ and .408 wOBA split in that regard. Sure, the Twins\u2019 third baseman is somewhat expensive, but he\u2019s marginally cheaper than Alex Bregman and Anthony Rendon with just as much (if not more) upside.\n\nAlso consider: Justin Turner, Tommy Edman\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nDidi Gregorius - New York Yankees (vs. Minnesota)\n\nThe Yankees represent the highest run-scoring projection of the night in an offense-heavy meeting with the Twins. Minnesota RHP Jose Berrios is an All-Star pitcher, but he has really struggled through the second half of the season. Those problems could be exposed against the mighty Yankees this evening, and Gregorius is a prime candidate to take advantage of New York\u2019s short porch in right field. The Twins only have one legitimate left-handed relief pitcher as well (Taylor Rogers), so it\u2019s unlikely Gregorius will fall into a lefty-lefty draw multiple times.\n\nAlso Consider: Paul DeJong, Corey Seager\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nDexter Fowler - St. Louis (at Atlanta)\n\nFowler is a steady mid-range pick in this slate. He\u2019s also a switch-hitter who won\u2019t give up the platoon advantage to anyone from Atlanta\u2019s bullpen. That\u2019s a nice bonus considering the unpredictability of individual matchups in the playoffs. As mentioned earlier, the Cardinals have the second-highest scoring projection of the day, and Fowler should hold a premium lineup spot while collecting three hits, one homer, and three RBIs over his past two outings.\n\nBrett Gardner - New York Yankees (vs. Minnesota)\n\nGardner stands to benefit from the same rationale outlined earlier with his teammate, Gregorius. Yes, Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton are more exciting lifts from the NYY outfield, but they also cost a pretty penny. Gardner is a value candidate who will help you allocate cap space to those top-dollar studs. You could argue that he\u2019s one of the best bargain hitters of this slate while potentially holding a premium lineup spot for a Yankee squad that holds the highest scoring projection of the day. Facing a struggling starting pitcher doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nAlso consider: Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Nelson Cruz, Joc Pederson, Matt Joyce", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the four-game playoff slate on Friday, October 4.
