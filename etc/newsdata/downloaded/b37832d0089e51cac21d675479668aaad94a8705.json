The World Bank says these countries typically have online business incorporation processes, electronic tax filing platforms, and online procedures for property transfers.\n\nWhen it comes to starting a business, New Zealand also topped the rankings. It takes just half a day to register a new company in that country \u2013 compared to South Africa, where the process takes 40 days.\n\nWhile New Zealand requires only one step, the World Bank notes that South African entrepreneurs have to complete seven procedures:\n\nReserve the company name at the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) (three days)\n\nRegister at the CIPC (five days)\n\nOpen a bank account (one day)\n\nRegister for income tax and withholding taxes (PAYE, UIF and SDL) with SARS (one day)\n\nRegister for VAT (seven days)\n\nRegister the company with the Unemployment Insurance Fund (five days, simultaneous with previous procedure)\n\nRegister employees with the Compensation Fund (thirty days, simultaneous with previous procedure)\n\nSouth Africa is now ranked 139 (out of 190 countries) on the ease of starting a business.\n\nThe report also found that it takes 155 days to secure a construction permit to build a warehouse in Johannesburg and 23 days to register a property.\n\nWhen it comes to trading across the borders, South Africa was ranked 145th, with documentary compliance taking on average 68 hours, while border compliance takes 92 hours.\n\nThe ten economies where business climates improved the most were Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Togo, Bahrain, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, China, India, and Nigeria, the study found.\n\nHere are South Africa's rankings in different categories:\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "The World Bank found it takes 155 days to secure a construction permit to build a warehouse and 23 days to register a property.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4912/07eb79cccd0a4b9397fc9f1dfbcc7ed1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
