It was one of the first capitals of the Khmer Empire, which controlled large swaths of Southeast Asia from the ninth to 15th centuries. Over the last 150 years, archaeologists have uncovered artifacts that they suspect came from Mahendraparvata, but they didn't have enough evidence to support the link \u2014 until now.\n\nA new paper has confirmed the location of Mahendraparvata in a Cambodian mountain range called Phnom Kulen. From 2012 to 2017, a team of international researchers observed nearly 600 newly discovered remnants of the ancient civilization. These included shrines, a royal palace, and a pyramid-shaped temple.\n\nThe city is arranged in a giant grid, which would make Mahendraparvata one of the first engineered landscapes of the era. But until recently, according to the researchers behind the paper, the area has received \"strikingly little attention.\"\n\n\"It is almost entirely missing from archaeological maps, except as a scatter of points denoting the remains of some brick temples,\" they said.\n\nNow that the civilization has a confirmed location, it could give new insight into how cities were built more than 1,000 years ago.\n\nLaser scanners helped reveal the city beneath the trees\n\nMahendraparvata may not have been a thriving city for long. It served as a capital during the years between the eighth and ninth centuries, but archaeologists believe it may only have functioned that way for decades before the Khmer Empire moved its operations to Angkor.\n\nAfter the city was abandoned, its wooden structures likely disintegrated, leaving scant evidence that it ever existed. What little was known about Mahendraparvata was preserved in ancient inscriptions.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, archaeologists began to speculate that the city was located on an elongated plateau in the region. The suspicion grew stronger in the 1930s, when historian Philippe Stern found temples and water channels in that area that dated back the ninth century.\n\nBut historians still had trouble confirming that the ruins belonged to Mahendraparvata.\n\nAncient city More\n\nJB Chevance\n\nThe site is covered by dense trees that make it hard to observe the forest floor. It's also somewhat dangerous to visit: From the early 1970s to the late 1990s, the area was occupied by the Khmer Rouge, a brutal regime that carried out genocide in Cambodia, and the terrain is still scattered with land mines.", "description": "For centuries, the ancient city of Mahendraparvata has been covered by dense trees that make it hard to observe.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kgFqpE4erdedHnfvQ5iUDQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/03ffd89a1d177276e1291dcf2ac18b83", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
