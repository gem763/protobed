To represent Asia and the two tier countries, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be proud of us as well. Japan is only going to get stronger.\u201d\n\nMakazole Mapimpi bagged a brace and Faf De Klerk also raced in over the course of 80 minutes in the Japanese capital, with Handre Pollard posting 11 points off the tee as South Africa squeezed the life out of their opponents.\n\nThe game was not without controversy, though. South Africa\u2019s Tendai Mtawarira was lucky to escape a red card after upending Keita Inagaki midway through the first-half.\n\nBut referee Wayne Barnes reached immediately for a yellow card, opting not to refer the decision to Television Match Official (TMO) Rowan Kitt, allowing Mtawarira to return to action after 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe stuck to it for 80 minutes, the first half the yellow card killed us,\u201d said Pollard afterwards. \u201cWe still managed to go in with the lead and knew if we kept being able to impose ourselves physically eventually they would break.\n\n\u201cWe knew if we kept hammering away the points would come. It\u2019s always tough playing the host nation, the boys handled that well, but it\u2019s back to the drawing board on Monday.\u201d\n\nThe Boks will now face Warren Gatland\u2019s Wales in Yokohama on Sunday, in a bid to reach their first final since 2007.", "description": "Japan\u00a0head coach Jamie Joseph praised \u201cthe courage and the tenacity\u201d of his men following their quarter-final defeat at the hands of South Africa, adding that he was \u201cproud\u201d of what the side has achieved on home soil.
