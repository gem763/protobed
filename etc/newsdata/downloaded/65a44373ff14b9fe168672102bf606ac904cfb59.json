Harris is founding editor of POLITICO and author of \"The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House.\"\n\nThe surprise attack on Hawaii came on a quiet Sunday morning, and it fell to the president of the United States to rally a confused and stricken nation one day later in a momentous address to Congress:\n\n\u201cYesterday, Dec. 7, 1941\u2014a date which will live as totally fucked up\u2014the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the naval and air forces of Japan.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s the power of language at work. And who can forget the image of an American commander in chief in Berlin on the front lines of the Cold War: \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this fucking wall.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be mature about this. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan both surely dropped a choice word or two in private, even on solemn subjects like Pearl Harbor and Soviet tyranny. Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, meanwhile, has not actually signaled that he will make the F-bomb a central part of his rhetorical arsenal in the unlikely event he becomes the next president.\n\nHe is, however, apparently hoping that vulgarity will be an engine of his political revival in the Democratic presidential contest. In doing so, he is part of a confluence of factors serving to mainstream what once counted as the most forbidden entry in the roster of four-letter words.\n\nNotice to reader: The examples above are just two of 14 profanities in this story. Editors decided to skip the coy dashes and asterisks and more straightforward [expletive deleteds]. How else to handle it when a candidate for president infuses a policy statement after a horrific mass shooting with the phrase, \u201cThis is fucked up\u201d?\n\nOn social media and in interviews, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s profanity has proved to be something of a political Rorschach test.\n\nPro: He has found a searing and even eloquent way of cutting through the madness and violence of the age. The real obscenity, by these lights, is routine mass shootings and the paralytic response they engender from the governing class, to which O\u2019Rourke\u2019s incredulity is a powerfully authentic rejoinder.\n\nCon: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s profanity is risible, a perfect summary of a campaign that even before was mocked for its alleged preening and Wayne\u2019s World affect. Even if the first time he dropped the F-bomb came as a genuine outburst, his repetition on Twitter and now official campaign T-shirts reveals calculation and contrivance\u2014making his vulgarities the opposite of the authenticity they supposedly convey.\n\nEither way, the Texan\u2019s coarse language is a frivolous dimension of a serious question for Democrats: Should progressive leaders confront the rawness and norm-shattering nature of President Donald Trump\u2019s political style with something similar? Or should they stand for a return to standards that used to be assumed for any presidential contender\u2014including language reflecting the gravity of the office, or at a minimum was G-rated?\n\nBefore O\u2019Rourke, the public figure who arguably was most notorious for his prolific use of the F-word was Rahm Emanuel, who kept the salty parlance of a political operative even as he became a member of Congress, White House chief of staff, and mayor of Chicago.\n\nEmanuel, who calls himself \u201ca reformed swearer,\u201d acknowledged in an interview, \u201cI\u2019ve got this notorious reputation and I\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t swear but you\u2019ve never heard me publicly swear. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people are being exhausted by vulgarity and I think [the candidates] should be engaging people on the future\u201d through the power of ideas, Emanuel explained.\n\nBut some other Obama White House veterans were more tolerant of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rhetorical excesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for him to show a little emotion and get angry so that people can see exactly where he stands and that he will fight for what he believes in,\" said Stephanie Cutter, Obama's former 2012 deputy campaign manager and cofounder of Precision Strategies.\n\n\u201cMost candidates do talk like this and they talk like this to their teams and at the bar with reporters, and they get credit for being real people and not engaged in some veneer,\u201d said former Obama press operative Ben LaBolt. \u201cBeto has used it to demonstrate outrage about some really outrageous issues that the United States should have been able to solve many years ago, and so his approach would distinguish himself from somebody who would serve in the Senate and say \u2018my dear friend\u2019 and \u2018my dear colleague.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy so frequently crossing a line that once might have been career-ending, O\u2019Rourke is partly changing the political culture, and partly reflecting changes that are already underway.\n\nAs far back as September 2014, Trump tweeted: \u201cEvery time I speak of the haters and losers I do so with great love and affection. They can not help the fact that they were born fucked up!\u201d More recently, in late March of this year, Trump told a campaign rally that Democrats should stop \u201cdefrauding the public with ridiculous bullshit.\"\n\nIn June 2017, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who recently ended her presidential campaign, tried to stir a conference on technology and democracy by imploring, \u201cIf we are not helping people, we should go the fuck home.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the year, newly elected Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib made a splash by saying of Trump, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna impeach the motherfucker.\u201d\n\nAnother newly elected member of Congress, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, was recently quoted by The Cut noting the annoyance of being asked as a female candidate about her \u201cself-care\u201d on the campaign trail: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t have fucking self-care! I\u2019m running for Congress.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke is the one who has made the word his signature. After making his Texas Senate race surprisingly competitive, before narrowly losing, in 2018, O\u2019Rourke went viral with his concession speech in which he praised supporters, \u201cI\u2019m so fucking proud of you guys.\u201d\n\nWhen he began his bid for president, O\u2019Rourke was scolded at a campaign stop by a voter who urged him to \u201cclean up his act\u201d and not use profanity in ways were children will hear it. \u201cPoint taken, and very strongly made,\u201d O\u2019Rourke replied, promising to \u201ckeep it clean.\u201d\n\nBut last month, meeting with reporters after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, O\u2019Rourke seemed impatient with what he regarded as the naivete of some questions about Trump\u2019s role in inciting violence. \u201cMembers of the press, what the fuck?!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nThere are two facts about the F-word that most people learn early in their teenage years: The reaction it gets depends on context, and its shock value tends to diminish rapidly. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s initial uses of the word did seem a little like a young person at a family dinner: Wonder how the table will respond?\n\nOn balance, O\u2019Rourke seems pleased with the reaction, at least among the people he cares most about. After new shootings in Texas, he went on CNN last Sunday morning to say: \u201cWe\u2019re averaging about 300 mass shootings a year. No other country comes close. So, yes, this is fucked up.\" He also defended his swearing by saying that it was \"just honest\" and important \"to shock the conscience of this country.\"\n\nO'Rourke's campaign also noted that all of the proceeds for his profane T-shirt go to March for Our Lives and Moms Demand.\n\nBrit Hume, the prominent Fox News journalist, commented on Twitter, \u201cAs if his sewermouth will somehow give his argument more power.\u201d\n\nBut Matt Bennett, a Democratic strategist unaffiliated with any presidential campaign and long-time gun control advocate, believes O\u2019Rourke was rightly trying to shake people and signal that conventional politics isn\u2019t adequate in the context of recurring mass murders.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s decided that profanity can help him add emphasis where other language fails,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cIndeed, how else does one underscore their anger with, frustration at, and contempt for public officials who fail to act in the face of such horror? We all have been railing about this for years (decades in my case). How else do we signal that this situation is singularly obscene?\"\n\nGeorge Lakoff, a retired Berkeley linguist who has written extensively on how Democrats sometimes lose political arguments by not effectively employing the power of language, was uncertain on the wisdom of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s shattering of old proprieties. \u201cIt\u2019s basically saying: This is really important. Pay attention.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke may have grabbed attention, but it\u2019s not clear how long he will keep it, at least based on the power of profanity. Forty-five years ago, the country was shocked by the prodigious use of Oval Office profanity\u2014often as part of contemptuous and vindictive rants against opponents\u2014by Richard Nixon and his aides when the White House tapes were released. The news media, reflecting the standards of the time, didn\u2019t print the words but replaced them with \u201c[expletive deleted].\u201d Anticipating Tlaib by several decades, protesters outside the White House gates carried placards saying \u201cImpeach the expletive deleted!\u201d\n\nBut a generation that currently has made a star of Lana Del Ray and her album \u201cNorman Fucking Rockwell\u201d with its hit song \u201cFuck It, I Love you\u201d isn\u2019t likely to stay shocked, or perhaps even interested, for very long by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s language.\n\nBack in 2004, when then-Vice President Dick Cheney told Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy to \u201cGo fuck yourself\u201d on the floor of the Senate, many news organizations debated internally about how to report the obviously newsworthy exchange\u2014since it involved words that were forbidden by their editorial standards.\n\nThose qualms seem irrelevant in the current climate.\n\nVeteran reporter Nicholas Lemann, a former dean of Columbia University\u2019s school of journalism, said these days, as politics grows more openly coarse, the news media should have no compunction about just reporting exactly what public figures say. The old notion of news organizations as a kind of unifying public square, in which editors had to primly enforce rules to ensure that the most sensitive people in the audience weren\u2019t offended, has gone by the wayside now that every online reader is essentially his or her own editor.\n\n\u201cIf they said it, you should quote it,\u201d Lemann advises.\n\nAnother journalist, James Fallows, also served as a stint as a speechwriter for Jimmy Carter, who he recalled sometimes swore in private but very rarely.\n\nHe sees O\u2019Rourke\u2019s language as a sign of the times.\n\n\u201cAs an old guy,\u201d said Fallows, who last month turned 70, \u201cI\u2019ll avoid any decline in civilization, but I guess until recently public figures felt that they had to observe a public-private barrier. ... Politicians have always been earthy people, but we are seeing the time, at least for the moment, the earthiness membrane is being pierced or is permeable.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: 2020", "description": "Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s uncouth language is a pungent sign of the times.", "authors": ["John F.
