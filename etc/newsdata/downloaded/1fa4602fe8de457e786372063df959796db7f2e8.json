As Linz was her 10th tournament, that means she has four events left to play until she turns 16 in March and will be free to enter as many events as she wants when she turns 18.\n\nCori Gauff reached the last 16 at Wimbledon on her debut this summer.\n\nThe best is yet to come\n\nThe more she'll play, the better she'll get, says Gauff, who will finish her year by playing in this week's WTA event in Luxembourg.\n\n\"It's always going to be a continuing process, just because I'm all new to the Tour, I haven't played that many players so my confidence may not be that high, but I think the more matches I play, the more confidence I'll (gain), just because the more experience I'll have,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Gauff played a smart match against the hyper-aggressive Ostapenko, absorbing the power and mixing up the pace, it looked for a moment as if the wheels were coming off at the end of the final set, when the Latvian saved two match points with huge hitting as she trailed 5-0.\n\nAfter Ostapenko held, Gauff played a passive service game and was broken to love. It took a chat with her father and coach, Corey Gauff, during the changeover to help steady her nerves.\n\n'Bright future'\n\n\"You are not going to sprint to the finish line, you are going to walk to the finish line,\" said Corey Gauff, who had flown in from Florida with his wife and Gauff's mother, Candi, the day before.\n\n\"He was trying to calm me down because he knew I was nervous and I was close to the finish line and I needed to close out,\" said Gauff. \"He was telling me to kind of swing for my shots, and go for my shots.\"\n\nShe did just that in the next game, taking the title on her third match point, thanks to a successful Hawk-Eye challenge, before putting her hands on her head in disbelief.\n\n\"You have a bright future, and I am really glad to share the court with you,\" Ostapenko told Gauff at the trophy ceremony.\n\n\"It's been an unbelievable week and definitely one of the biggest accomplishments of my career so far,\" said Gauff.", "description": "Teen tennis sensation Cori 'Coco' Gauff talks exclusively to CNN Sport about winning her first  tournament title in Linz, Austria.", "authors": ["Danielle Rossingh", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191013152710-gauff-title-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
