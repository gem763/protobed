It gave no details but said the two sides wanted to create \u201cfavorable conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is pressing Beijing to roll back plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other industries.\n\nThe United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate China\u2019s market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nBeijing has agreed to narrow its politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States but is reluctant to give up development strategies it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nTalks broke down in May over how to enforce any agreement.\n\nChina insists President Donald Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs must be lifted once a deal takes effect. Washington says at least some must stay to make sure Beijing carries out any promises.\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume talks, but the last round in July in Shanghai ended with no indication of progress. Neither government has given any indication it is ready to break the deadlock by offering concessions.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "U.S. and Chinese envoys will meet in early October for talks aimed at ending a tariff war, later than initially planned, China's Commerce Ministry announced Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/29/china_us_trade_74631_c0-221-5300-3311_s1770x1032.jpg?d26168189c0f880b9fd655ac558d5a462bcdeac6"}
