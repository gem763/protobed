She kept getting stuck on the same question: is it wrong to bring new life into a world that's so chaotic? While she wrestled with the decision, she decided to use art to work though her anxiety.\n\nThe result is her new graphic novel, The Hard Tomorrow, which takes place in a fictional world that's somewhat similar to our own. Trees are dying, Mark Zuckerberg is president, and the main character, Hannah, is trying to figure out what she can do in her own small way to help.\n\nDavis wrote The Hard Tomorrow while she was pregnant with her first child, Daniel. She joined q's Tom Power from Athens, Ga. to tell us more about her work and being a mother.\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link above to hear the full conversation with Eleanor Davis.\n\n\u2014 Produced by Vanessa Greco", "description": "Eleanor Davis discusses how creating her new graphic novel, The Hard Tomorrow, helped her work through her anxiety about bringing new life into a chaotic world.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318493.1571238192!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/eleanor-davis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
