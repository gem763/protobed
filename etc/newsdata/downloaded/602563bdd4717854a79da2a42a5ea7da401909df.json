Days after the decision, Brown tweeted that he \u201cwill not be playing the NFL anymore\u201d and ripped the league\u2019s team owners for voiding guaranteed money in player contracts.\n\n\u201cI believe that Antonio wants to continue his career in the NFL. I have had discussions with a few teams that are very interested in him and want to know about his future and what\u2019s going on with the NFL,\u201d Rosenhaus said during an appearance on Warren Sapp\u2019s \u201c99 Problems\u201d podcast, which was posted online Wednesday. \u201cHopefully, when that is all resolved, Antonio will be able to continue his Hall of Fame career.\u201d\n\nRosenhaus did not specify which NFL teams have expressed interest in Brown, and no NFL team has publicly said it was considering a contract offer. As Brown\u2019s agent, Rosenhaus is responsible for gauging the market for his client and brokering an eventual deal, if available.\n\nThe circumstances behind Brown\u2019s release led some football pundits, including ESPN insider Adam Schefter, to speculate that his NFL career could be over. Brown faces a civil lawsuit from his former personal trainer, who alleges that Brown raped her during a 2018 encounter, as well as a second allegation from an artist who accused him of exposing himself while she painted a mural at his Pittsburgh-area home in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown has denied wrongdoing in both cases.\n\n\"It's my hope, it's Antonio's hope, that he'll be back playing as soon as possible,\" Rosenhaus added.\n\nThe NFL said last week that if Brown were to sign with a team, he could be subject to placement on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list, which functions as a type of paid leave, or disciplinary action pending the results of its investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Brown has been a free agent since Sept. 20, when the New England Patriots released him amid an NFL investigation.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/cc8d73ad-Antonio-Brown-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
