Coincidently, in the coming week we'll also have a couple of important earnings releases from companies within those sectors. This might provide more insight on how consumer and technology companies are weathering the ongoing trade pressure.\n\nWith this theme in mind, here are our three top stocks to focus on in the week ahead.\n\n1. Nike\n\nNike (NYSE: ) will release its first quarter fiscal 2020 financial earnings on Tuesday, Sept. 24, after the market close. Analysts, on average, expect the sportswear giant to make $0.7 a share profit on sales of $10.43 billion.\n\nNKE Weekly TTM\n\nAfter surging to a record high of $90 a share in April, Nike stock has become vulnerable to the U.S.-Sino trade dispute. The stock slipped more than 1% on Friday, closing at $86.68. However, digging a little deeper, it becomes apparent that the risks to the world\u2019s largest sports apparel company aren\u2019t actually that big.\n\nNike has been consistently diversifying its production away from China\u2014a strategy that's made it less exposed to tariffs on Chinese imports. About 26% of Nike\u2019s footwear and apparel were made in China last year. But according to Susquehanna Financial Group, less than 10% of that is imported to the U.S.\n\nDuring its last call, in late June, Nike executives downplayed the China risks by saying the trade war hadn't impacted Nike as yet since the company continues to source products from China. That being said, Nike shares won\u2019t be able to withstand a sharp sell-off in China-exposed stocks should that occur. And weakness in its shares might accelerate if we don\u2019t see a trade resolution soon.\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nChipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) will report fiscal 2019, fourth quarter earnings, on Thursday, Sept. 26, after the close. Analysts are expecting EPS of $0.51 on sales of $4.58 billion.\n\nMU Weekly TTM\n\nSince late June, Micron shares have recovered sharply, surging more than 50% on signs that weakness in the chip market has run its course. The stock closed down 1.32% to $49.16 on Friday.\n\nThe largest U.S. maker of computer memory told investors in June that it resumed some shipments to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., despite the U.S. export ban. Micron said it studied the export restrictions and determined \u201ca subset\u201d of products it sells to Huawei are not subject to the rules, Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said on a conference call that time..\n\nMicron was forced to halt their shipments to one of its largest customers after the Trump administration banned Huawei from buying American technology. Micron makes chips used as the main memory in computers and as storage in mobile devices.\n\nSales to the Chinese telecommunications company generate about 13% of Micron\u2019s annual revenue. Micron\u2019s and conference call will provide further insight into the sector\u2019s demand outlook for the remaining part of the year.\n\n3. Netflix\n\nThe slump in shares of streaming entertainment giant, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is deepening as it biggest rivals, including Disney (NYSE: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), get ready to launch their services in November.\n\nNFLX Weekly TTM\n\nstock fell more than 5% on Friday to close at $270.75 after CEO Reed Hastings said the entrance of Apple, Disney and NBC (NASDAQ: ) to the global streaming market will push content costs higher and will be \u201ca whole new world starting in November.\u201d\n\nShares are down more than 25% since early July. Investors should expect this weak performance to continue until there are clear indications that the giant is holding on to its market share.\n\nIn the , Netflix missed expectations in both domestic and international markets, suggesting that expansion from here is getting tough as subscribers have a broader variety of entertainment options to choose from.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Haris Anwar/Investing.com covering: USD/JPY, S&P 500, Walt Disney Company, Apple Inc.
