Can the group see things through in World Series?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE What I'm Hearing: Bob Nightengale delivers some news that Nationals fans don't wan't to hear about one of their ace pitchers. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 Come Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park, the Washington Nationals will stare down elimination for the fourth time this postseason, trailing by a game in this World Series and tasked with toppling future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander to keep their season alive.\n\nA 3-2 deficit is far from the only way the Nationals are trying to beat the odds, however. In fact, you could suggest they\u2019ve been trying to do it all October with a historically challenging task:\n\nWin a World Series with just six pitchers.\n\nMake no mistake, the Nationals have certainly deployed more pitchers \u2013 12 in all. Yet, as they\u2019ve navigated a harrowing wild-card game, a five-game conquest of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series, a sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series and this back-and-forth battle with the Houston Astros in the World Series, the Nationals\u2019 blueprint has been clear.\n\nWhen at all possible, they want the ball in the hands of starters Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin and Anibal Sanchez \u2013 whether starting or in relief \u2013 as well as top bullpen arms Daniel Hudson and Sean Doolittle.\n\nThe plan worked brilliantly as the Nationals started the postseason on a staggering 10-2 run that gave them a 2-0 World Series lead over the Astros, with the series shifting to Washington for three games.\n\nStephen Strasburg is scheduled to start Game 6 for the Nationals. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAt that point, the Nationals\u2019 Big Six had covered 88.6% of their total innings, more than any sextet in a decade, and included crucial relief outings from starters Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin in the wild card and NLDS.\n\nNot since the 2009 Yankees \u2013 who received 87.4% of their innings from CC Sabathia, Andy Pettitte, A.J. Burnett, Mariano Rivera, Joba Chamberlain and Phil Hughes \u2013 had a World Series club received so many innings from so few arms, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nWith Sabathia, Pettitte and Burnett pitching on three days\u2019 rest \u2013 and benefiting from an AL Division Series sweep \u2013 the Yankees went 11-4 in winning their 27th World Series championship.\n\nThese Nationals are facing an even taller task \u2013 playing their way through a wild card game and then facing a 106-win Dodgers team in the NLDS and the 107-win Astros in the World Series.\n\nIt is a task the team\u2019s top four starters began mentally preparing for as the club put its grip on a wild card berth.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been unbelievable, they really have,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said Monday before his club hopped a flight from Washington to Houston. \u201cI\u2019m proud of them, and this was all based on conversations I\u2019ve had with them since September.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all in. They\u2019re all in and I\u2019m proud of every one of them.\u201d\n\nNow, they will have to finish the task without one of their stalwarts.\n\nScherzer was scratched before his Game 5 start on Sunday with spasms in his neck and right trapezius that rendered him unable to lift his arm. Scherzer received a cortisone shot Sunday and the club is hoping he can beat the odds and contribute in Game 7 should Strasburg carry them to a season-saving Game 6 win.\n\nYet the Astros managed to poke holes in the Nationals\u2019 pitching foundation before Scherzer\u2019s injury.\n\nThey hen-pecked Sanchez in Friday\u2019s Game 3, scoring single runs in four innings as the righty recorded 16 outs. Houston won 4-1 to get back in the Series.\n\nIn Game 4, Corbin made his seventh appearance of the postseason \u2013 four relief outings tucked between three starts. Perhaps it\u2019s just a coincidence, but Corbin\u2019s starts have regressed:\n\nSix innings, one earned run in the NLDS\n\nFive innings, four earned runs in the NLCS.\n\nAnd a 4-0 deficit after four innings of Saturday\u2019s Game 5, though Corbin managed to complete six innings of an 8-1 loss.\n\nStill, the Nationals probably aren\u2019t here without Corbin\u2019s crucial relief work in Game 5 of the NLDS, Game 2 of the NLCS and Game 1 of the World Series.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about in the postseason. Everybody has to have the cleats on every single day,\u201d says Hall of Famer and MLB Network analyst Pedro Martinez, who started and lost Game 6 of the 2009 World Series against the Yankees\u2019 Pettitte. \u201cYou want to have the very best you can possibly have out there against the opposition.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s a mix-and-match strategy the Boston Red Sox used to perfection last year, when Chris Sale, David Price, Nathan Eovaldi and Rick Porcello toggled from starting to relieving as the Red Sox rolled through an 11-3 postseason to capture the 2018 World Series.\n\nStill, even with Eovaldi chipping in an epic six-inning relief outing in an 18-inning World Series Game 3 loss, the Red Sox\u2019s load management was remarkable. Their four starters plus relievers Joe Kelly and Craig Kimbrel accounted for 75% of the Red Sox\u2019s 134 postseason innings.\n\nManager Alex Cora pushed the buttons brilliantly all October \u2013 and had a lot of buttons to push. Lefty Eduardo Rodriguez made one spot start and several key relief outings and right-handers Matt Barnes, Ryan Brasier and Heath Hembree were generally trusted with high-leverage situations in front of closer Kimbrel \u2013 or whichever Red Sox starter might be handling the eighth and ninth on a given night.\n\nMartinez does not have that luxury. The Nationals\u2019 regular-season bullpen ERA of 5.66 was the worst of any postseason qualifier, ever. A late-season makeover that most notably added Hudson improved the group significantly, but right-handers such as Fernando Rodney, rookie Tanner Rainey and Wander Suero fall more into the \u201cif necessary\u201d category rather than a preferred option.\n\nShould they fall short, the Nationals may ultimately wonder how much difference one more reliable arm might have made.\n\nStill, Martinez remains upbeat, lauding the group beyond the Big Six and noting that Rodney gamely took the ball every night in Games 3, 4 and 5.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 0-3 performance in those games not coincidentally came as their Big Six inning percentage dropped to 81.2%. It should tick back up with Strasburg starting Game 6 and Hudson and Doolittle again rested.\n\nMartinez does not expect a lack of volunteers to go above and beyond to win these final games \u2013 and a World Series championship.\n\n\u201cSanchie told me he can throw 150 pitches,\u201d Martinez said of Sanchez, the lone starter yet to appear out of the bullpen this postseason.\n\nThat might be a bit extreme, but the Nationals certainly expect their group to summon their reserves one more time \u2013 no matter how they may feel.\n\nAs for their bodies?\n\n\u201cYou worry about that,\u201d says Martinez, \u201cafter the season is over.\u201d", "description": "The Nationals have navigated through the playoffs using mostly just six pitchers, covering nearly 82% of their total pitches.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
