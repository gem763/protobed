The son of a Muslim and an Orthodox Christian, and of mixed ethnic heritage, he is a symbol of what he would like to achieve in a country of some 80 ethnicities and some 110 million people. That fractious mix could also bring him down.\n\n\u201cNo doubt some people will think this year\u2019s prize is being awarded too early,\u201d the Nobel committee said. But \u201cit is now that Abiy Ahmed\u2019s efforts deserve recognition and need encouragement.\u201d\n\nAbiy seemed to come out of nowhere, taking office in early 2018 after widespread protests pressured Ethiopia\u2019s longtime ruling coalition and hurt one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies. Within weeks, Africa\u2019s youngest leader shocked the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region by fully accepting a peace deal ending a 20-year border war with neighboring Eritrea that saw some 80,000 people killed.\n\nSuddenly, one of the world\u2019s longest-running conflicts was ending.\n\nThe visibly moved Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, soon visited Addis Ababa and diplomatic, communications and transport links were restored. For the first time in two decades, long-divided families made tearful reunions.\n\nThe Nobel committee cited that peacemaking in awarding Abiy the prize and acknowledged that \u201cpeace does not arise from the actions of one party alone.\u201d When Abiy \u201creached out his hand, President Afwerki grasped it.\u201d\n\nThe government of Eritrea, still one of the world\u2019s most closed-off nations, did not immediately comment, and the country has shown no sign of following Ethiopia\u2019s reforms. The Nobel committee said it hoped the award would bring positive change for all in both countries. It also noted Abiy\u2019s other efforts toward reconciliation in the region \u2014 between Eritrea and Djibouti, between Kenya and Somalia, and in Sudan.\n\nAt home, Abiy has offered one surprise after another. He released tens of thousands of prisoners, welcomed home once-banned opposition groups and acknowledged past abuses. People expressed themselves freely on social media, and he announced that Ethiopia would hold free and fair elections in 2020. He named one of the world\u2019s few \u201cgender-balanced\u201d Cabinets and a female president, a rarity in Africa.\n\nAnd for the first time Ethiopia has no journalists in prison, media groups noted last year. The progress has been \u201cincredible,\u201d the United States said Friday.\n\nThe new prime minister also announced the opening-up of Ethiopia\u2019s tightly controlled economy, saying private investment would be welcome in major state-owned sectors \u2014 a process that continues slowly.\n\nBut while Abiy became a global darling, troubles arose at home.\n\nA grenade was thrown at him during an appearance in the capital last year, and weeks later a large group of soldiers confronted him in his office in what he called an attempt to derail his reforms. In a display of the brio that has won Abiy widespread admiration, the former military officer defused the situation by dropping to the floor and joining the troops in push-ups.\n\nMore troubling are Ethiopia\u2019s deadly ethnic tensions as people once stifled by repression now act on long-held grievances. Some 1,200 people have been killed and some 1.2 million displaced in the greatest challenge yet to Abiy\u2019s rule. Some observers warn that the unrest will grow ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s government also has begun reaching for some of the controls it had abandoned. Arbitrary arrests have been reported and internet shutdowns have returned, and the prime minister has defended them in the interest of calming unrest, saying internet service is \u201cneither water nor air.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel committee acknowledged that \u201cmany challenges remain unresolved.\u201d And human rights and humanitarian groups moved quickly to urge Abiy to \u201ccontinue to be brave,\u201d as the Norwegian Refugee Council said.\n\nDespite the concerns, global praise poured in. \u201cI have said often that winds of hope are blowing ever stronger across Africa. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is one of the main reasons why,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.\n\nAt home, some Ethiopians urged their fast-moving young leader to do even more. \u201cThis prize is the begging of him to do much better than now,\u201d said one resident of the capital, Abebe Arega.\n\nSo far this week, 11 Nobel laureates have been named. The others received their awards for their achievements in medicine , physics , chemistry and literature . The economics award is to be announced on Monday.\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma to be awarded at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway, on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel\u2019s death. Even though the peace prize is awarded in Norway, the amount is denominated in Swedish kronor.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on the 2019 Nobel Prizes by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/NobelPrizes\n\n___\n\nAnna reported from Johannesburg.
