(Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: After President Trump initiated a phone call with Vladimir Putin on July 31, the American people found out when the Russian government posted about it on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe White House press office waited several hours to confirm that the call took place and then did so with a two-sentence statement sent to a pool reporter after 10 p.m. Trump \u201cexpressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia,\u201d the 28-word statement read. \u201cThe leaders also discussed trade between the two countries.\u201d\n\nThe 149-word Russian readout went further: \u201cThe President of Russia regards the US President\u2019s offer as a sign that it is possible that full-scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future. The presidents of Russia and the United States agreed to continue contacts in the form of telephone conversations as well as personal meetings.\u201d\n\nThis is one of several newsworthy communications that Trump had with a foreign head of state that first became public because the other side disclosed it. The Trump White House has curtailed the longstanding, bipartisan practice of automatically sending out summaries of presidential communications with other world leaders. That retreat from transparency, which has often allowed adversaries to shape the narrative, merits fresh scrutiny and raises a battery of new questions in the wake of a big scoop overnight by my colleagues.\n\n-- \u201cThe whistleblower complaint that has triggered a tense showdown between the U.S. intelligence community and Congress involves President Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader,\u201d Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Shane Harris report, citing two former U.S. officials familiar with the matter:\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s interaction with the foreign leader included a \u2018promise\u2019 that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community \u2026 It was not immediately clear which foreign leader Trump was speaking with or what he pledged to deliver \u2026 One former official said the communication was a phone call. \u2026\n\n\u201cIntelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson determined that the complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u2018urgent concern,\u2019 a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to share details about Trump\u2019s alleged transgression with lawmakers, touching off a legal and political dispute that has spilled into public view and prompted speculation that the spy chief is improperly protecting the president. \u2026 The complaint was filed with Atkinson\u2019s office on Aug. 12, a date on which Trump was at his golf resort in New Jersey. White House records indicate that Trump had had conversations or interactions with at least five foreign leaders in the preceding five weeks.\u201d\n\n-- One of those five interactions was that July 31 phone call with Putin:\n\nUS President Donald Trump, in phone talks with Vladimir Putin, offered assistance to Moscow in fighting wildfires in Siberia. The Russian president viewed Trump's offer as a sign that fully-fledged bilateral relations could be restored in the future\n\n\ud83d\udd39https://t.co/IUDFt5s6F3 \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/oe3YDbhEyg \u2014 Russia in USA \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa (@RusEmbUSA) July 31, 2019\n\n-- On Aug. 20, Trump reiterated his call for Russia to be allowed to rejoin the Group of Seven industrial nations. \u201cI guess President Obama, because Putin outsmarted him \u2014 President Obama thought it wasn\u2019t a good thing to have Russia in, so he wanted Russia out,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office before flying to France for the G-7, referring to his predecessor\u2019s push for a united stand against Russia after it annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s much more appropriate to have Russia in.\u201d Russia was expelled from the group in 2014 after the annexation, which Obama called a violation of international law. The Kremlin subsequently interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n-- If the whistleblower complaint turns out to be about something Trump said on the Putin call, it would certainly not be the first time the president\u2019s interactions with one of the United States\u2019 biggest geopolitical rivals have caused heartburn for career intelligence professionals.\n\nIn March 2018, Trump ignored specific warnings from his national security advisers when he congratulated Putin on his reelection. \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE,\u201d his briefing materials stated in all-capital letters. Experts said Putin only got 76 percent of the vote because it was a rigged election.\n\nIn May 2017, Trump revealed classified information about espionage operations in Syria to senior Russian officials in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump has gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Putin, including on at least one occasion taking possession of the notes of his own interpreter and instructing the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials. \u201cTrump did so after a meeting with Putin in 2017 in Hamburg that was also attended by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson,\u201d Miller reported in January. \u201cU.S. officials learned of Trump\u2019s actions when a White House adviser and a senior State Department official sought information from the interpreter beyond a readout shared by Tillerson.\u201d\n\n-- The White House decision to restrict private and public readouts of Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders followed a series of leaks that embarrassed Trump. (The Washington Post, you might recall, published full transcripts in the summer of 2017 of Trump\u2019s calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico.)\n\nIn another memorable episode from April 2017, no one at the White House was aware that Trump had spoken on his personal cellphone with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They found out only when Canada issued a readout that said Trudeau complained to Trump of \u201cunfair duties\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d claims about trade by Trump administration officials. \u201cAfter the call, White House aides urged Trump to route all conversations with foreign leaders through the Situation Room, as required under federal records law,\" a senior administration official told The Post at the time.\n\n-- Social media is abuzz with reaction to the latest revelations:\n\nFrom a former CIA spokesman who resigned when Trump took office:\n\nThe White House readout made mention of only Siberian wildfires and trade as topics of discussion. The Russians, as their tweet above suggests, came away think normalization of relations was on the table. \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Ned Price (@nedprice) September 19, 2019\n\nFrom a senior counsel at the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration:\n\nKey point: the Inspector General who is fighting the Acting DNI to transmit this info to Congress WAS APPOINTED BY TRUMP.

(Stringer/Reuters)\n\n\u00ad-- A Taliban suicide bomber attack struck a hospital in southern Afghanistan, leaving more than 15 dead, while a U.S. airstrike killed nine civilians in the country\u2019s east. Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of the Interior said the car bomb in the southern Zabul province also wounded 66 people. U.S. Col. William Leggett said the U.S. airstrike conducted in the Nangahar province was targeting Islamic State group fighters, Susannah George reports.\n\n-- Trudeau apologized for wearing brownface and blackface after a yearbook picture surfaced showing him at an Arabian Nights-themed party in 2001, embroiling the Canadian prime minister in another scandal as he struggles to win a second term. Amanda Coletta, Hannah Knowles and Reis Thebault report: \u201cThe photograph, published Wednesday by Time and taken while Trudeau was a teacher at the private West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver, depicts the then-29-year-old smiling while wearing a feathered turban, his face darkened in a practice with racist roots. \u2026 \u2018I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on,\u2019 Trudeau said at a news conference Wednesday evening. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should\u2019ve known better, but I didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m really sorry.\u2019 Trudeau also admitted to wearing blackface in high school while singing the song 'Day-O' at a talent show. ... Trudeau faces a formidable challenge from Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, who blasted his opponent Wednesday night, calling the brownface photo 'an act of open mockery and racism.'\"\n\nExclusive: Justin Trudeau wore brownface at 2001 \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party while he taught at a private school, Canada's Liberal Party admits https://t.co/j3UobfYNIF \u2014 TIME (@TIME) September 18, 2019\n\n-- Pennsylvania state Sen. Mike Folmer (R) resigned after being charged with possession of child pornography. \u201cThe married grandfather of seven was charged as the result of a tip that the blogging site Tumblr had found that a user had uploaded an image of child pornography using its application,\u201d Lateshia Beachum reports. \u201cFolmer told authorities that he received child pornography images through his Tumblr blog and that he was experiencing \u2018some personal problems,\u2019 according to the Patriot-News\u2019s review of charging documents.\u201d\n\nAttorney General William Barr arrives at the White House on Monday. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- Trump\u2019s leaked plan to expand background checks on firearm sales prompted attacks from the National Rifle Association, which promised to fight it. Seung Min Kim, Paul Kane and Josh Dawsey report: The NRA \u201cimmediately dismissed the plan drafted by the Justice Department as a non-starter. A White House spokesman denied that the document was a White House product \u2014 even though its top legislative official was briefing GOP senators on the plan\u2019s details. Many Republicans who reviewed the specifics of the background checks measure remained lukewarm about it, and a handful of GOP senators who had been directly briefed by Attorney General William P. Barr on the plan acknowledged that the proposal was incomplete \u2014 at best.\u201d\n\n-- Trump claimed a deal on guns has become \u201cmuch harder\u201d because of Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s calls for a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons. O\u2019Rourke, Trump tweeted, \u201cconvinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Congress is still waiting for Trump\u2019s guidance on what gun-related proposals he\u2019s willing to support, per John Wagner.\n\n-- A new report released by Democrats on Congress\u2019s Joint Economic Committee measured the staggering human economic toll of gun violence in all 50 states. Some key findings:\n\nFirearms killed more people than motor vehicle accidents for the first time in 2017.\n\nSixty percent of gun deaths each year are suicides.\n\nGun violence costs the country $229 billion a year, or 1.4 percent of the nation\u2019s GDP.\n\nCompared to other high-income countries, the U.S.\u2019s gun-related fatality rate is nearly 50 times higher for teens and young adults.\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi said she would have held former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in contempt \u201cright then and there\u201d when he showed disrespect to House members during his hearing. Rachael Bade reports: \u201cIn a small huddle with lawmakers from across the caucus, Pelosi (D-Calif.) complained that no witness should be able to treat members of Congress like [Lewandowski] did during a Tuesday hearing before the House Judiciary Committee \u2026 Several lawmakers in the room took her remarks as a dig at House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who chose not to hold Lewandowski in contempt for his defiant behavior on Tuesday.\u201d\n\n-- House Democrats eager to impeach Trump are struggling to galvanize public support. Bade, Mike DeBonis and Josh Dawsey report: While Lewandowski\u2019s \u201cacrimonious testimony drew headlines and attention, even some impeachment proponents said it wouldn\u2019t sway the public. \u2026 The skepticism underscores a problem Democrats face as they weigh whether to draft articles of impeachment this fall: Voters overwhelmingly oppose a move to oust the president \u2014 and some polls even show sentiment moving in the opposite direction. The public, some Democrats fear, is becoming desensitized to Trump-related scandals, making the committee\u2019s job convincing voters even more difficult. \u2026 \u2018Any other president, had they done one of those things [Trump has] \u2014 the public would be screaming,\u2019 said Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.). \u2018The public has become numb, and he gets away with it.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The White House will pull the nomination of Jeffery Byard to lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency, per Politico: \u201cThe official said that Byard withdrew his nomination after an accusation surfaced that he was in an altercation. The official also said that the FBI determined that the accusation was unsubstantiated.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said he\u2019s \u201cdoubtful\u201d he\u2019ll support Trump judicial nominee Steven Mensahi. \u201cMy thought is, look, if he\u2019ll treat a United States senator the way he treated us, I wonder how he would treat the people,\u201d Kennedy told HuffPost, throwing a major blow at an already controversial court pick.\n\n-- Lynne Patton, a senior Housing and Urban Development official, was reprimanded by the Office of Special Counsel for making political statements on the job. Patton \u201cused her official government Twitter account to promote political tweets and displayed a red \u2018USA\u2019 hat sold by the Trump campaign in her office,\u201d Politico reports. She was issued a warning letter determining that both activities violated the Hatch Act, but she was cleared of two other alleged violations, including an appearance at an oversight hearing featuring former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\n-- Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy plan includes special protection for the Sackler family fortune. If lawsuits against the wealthy family aren\u2019t halted, the Sacklers \"may be unwilling\u2014or unable\" to contribute billions to the drugmaker\u2019s bankruptcy as planned, Purdue said in a court filing. (Renae Merle and Lenny Bernstein)\n\n-- Federal authorities are conducting a criminal investigation of the former compliance officer at a McKesson Corp. warehouse in southern central Ohio, alleging he conspired to illegally distribute powerful narcotics over eight years. Bernstein, Matt Zapotosky and Scott Higham report: \u201cWith no announcement, David B. Gustin was indicted in March by a grand jury in eastern Kentucky on one count of conspiracy, a charge that carries a penalty of as much as 20 years in prison \u2026 The court records reveal the charges against Gustin stem from his responsibility to detect whether 13,000 pharmacy customers in 15 states were allowing drugs distributed by McKesson to be diverted to the black market. Two other people have been told they are possible targets of the probe, and subpoenas for information have been issued to McKesson, the largest drug distributor in the United States\u2026\u201d\n\n-- Trump threatened to slap San Francisco with environmental violations over its homeless population. Allyson Chiu reports: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a terrible situation \u2014 that\u2019s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\u2019 Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ... Trump said the [Environmental Protection Agency] should issue a notice in less than a week. It is unclear what laws San Francisco is accused of violating, but the president cited \u2018tremendous pollution\u2019 entering the ocean through storm sewers, specifically expressing a concern about used needles. \u2018They have to clean it up,\u2019 he said. \u2018We can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u2019\u201d\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- While Trump claims his plan to respond to Iran remains \u201cvery fluid,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid the blame on Tehran and labeled the attack an \u201cact of war.\u201d Kareem Fahim, Carol Morello and John Wagner report: \u201cPompeo, who met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday evening, told reporters shortly before arriving in Saudi Arabia that the intelligence community had \u2018high confidence\u2019 that the weapons systems used in the attacks were not in the Houthis\u2019 arsenal. The attacks had also not come from the south, where the Houthis control territory, he added, citing \u2018flight patterns\u2019 that would have explained the location of impact points at the Saudi oil facilities. \u2018This was an Iranian attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018It didn\u2019t come from the Houthis.\u2019 ... A senior administration official familiar with Pompeo\u2019s visit said the U.S. team examined photos and debris, including some intact weaponry.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the United States still has not issued visas for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his delegation to go to New York next week for the United Nations General Assembly, and the Iranians may cancel their trip, state media reported Wednesday. Pompeo declined to discuss visas for Rouhani and Zarif, whom the United States sanctioned in July.\u201d\n\n-- Pompeo said he\u2019s in the Middle East to build a coalition to deter Iran and signaled that the U.S. will use the upcoming U.N. assembly to rally for support for action against Tehran. From CNN: \u201cVice President Mike Pence has suggested a military retaliation is possible ... But the President and US allies are sending conflicting signals. Trump, who campaigned on getting the US out of foreign fights and has been critical of American involvement in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, faces a battle for reelection that would be complicated by a new conflict. And Saudi officials have made clear to the White House that they do not want to be dragged into war either.\u201d\n\n-- Iran\u2019s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned that any attack on his country will result in \u201call-out war,\u201d in an apparent response to Pompeo\u2019s comments. (AP)\n\n-- Trump tapped Robert C. O\u2019Brien, who previously served as the nation\u2019s top hostage negotiator, as his new national security adviser, replacing John Bolton. John Hudson and John Wagner report: O\u2019Brien\u2019s appointment solidifies Pompeo\u2019s status as \u201cthe most influential foreign policy voice in the administration. Pompeo has known O\u2019Brien for years and backed his ascension to the job after battling with Bolton over an array of policy issues on Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea \u2026 Officials said [O\u2019Brien\u2019s] friendly demeanor and experience as a lawyer could bring more stability and collegiality to an often chaotic policymaking process going into the 2020 election.\u201d\n\n-- The new national security chief forged a relationship with Trump while working to secure the freedom of American hostages. Missy Ryan, Shane Harris and John Hudson report: \u201cPeople close to some of the hostages freed and their families say they believe his appointment might bring more attention to their plight. \u2026 Since the beginning of the Trump administration, some 20 Americans have been released from imprisonment or captivity abroad, though it is difficult to say whether O\u2019Brien\u2019s efforts were pivotal in the release of those freed under his watch. \u2026 O\u2019Brien has shown himself to be a skilled bureaucrat, developing a strong channel to top administration officials and securing a role in policy deliberations beyond hostage issues...\u201d\n\n-- From the sidelines, Bolton has made little secret of his disagreements with the president. From Politico's Daniel Lippman: Bolton \u201charshly criticized Trump\u2019s foreign policy on Wednesday at a private lunch, saying that inviting the Taliban to Camp David sent a 'terrible signal' and that it was \u2018disrespectful\u2019 to the victims of 9/11 because the Taliban had harbored al Qaeda. Bolton also said that any negotiations with North Korea and Iran were \u2018doomed to failure,\u2019 according to two attendees. All the North Koreans and Iranians want to do is negotiate for relief from sanctions to support their economies, said Bolton, who was speaking before guests invited by the Gatestone Institute, a conservative think tank. \u2018He ripped Trump, without using his name, several times,\u2019 said one attendee.\u201d\n\n-- O\u2019Brien will inherit a National Security Council struggling to attract talent, current and former U.S. officials told NPR: \u201cIn the Trump administration, some of the government's brightest minds are turning down high-powered NSC assignments, and others are avoiding the place altogether. Career foreign policy professionals increasingly fear that joining the NSC, which is part of the White House, will taint them as political operatives. \u2018There is a school of thought that it can be risky for your career \u2014 sometimes being there puts you in a position where you have to say no to ambassadors and other senior officials, and they may remember that when you return,\u2019 said one senior foreign policy official who turned down an offer to serve at the NSC. \u2026 A senior NSC official dismissed concerns that people don't hold the NSC in the same regard as before. He said Trump has sought to slim down the NSC, so there may not be as many opportunities. The people he knew, though, were proud of their work and extended their assignments.\u201d\n\n-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seeing his chances of outright victory slipping as the final votes from this week\u2019s election were counted, called for a power-sharing agreement with his chief political rival \u2014 who promptly shot him down. Ruth Eglash and Steve Hendrix report: \u201cBenny Gantz, head of the center-left Blue and White party, said he was open to the idea of unity government as long he was at the top of it. Netanyahu had rejected the idea of a unity government throughout the campaign, but he invited Gantz to \u2018meet me today\u2019 soon after Blue and White was shown to have picked up another parliamentary seat, giving it an edge over Netanyahu\u2019s ruling Likud party of 33 seats to 31, with 97 percent of the vote recorded. \u2026\n\n\u201cGantz said his party won the election outright, receiving a larger share of the votes than Likud. He also said he would continue to pursue the creation of a centrist, secular and liberal government. \u2026 The shortest path to a majority for either major party is to turn to the other for a coalition and share the prime minister\u2019s job and other top positions on a rotating basis. Israel has had several such unity governments, including a period in the 1980s when rivals Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir shared power. Netanyahu and Gantz both appeared \u2014 and shook hands \u2014 at a memorial service for Peres on Thursday, and Netanyahu called for the parties to follow his example of power sharing. \u2026 But in today\u2019s Israel \u2014 a polarized country with Netanyahu one of its most polarizing figures \u2014 a unity government would be a tough sell, even if the two party leaders begin to talk.\u201d\n\n-- Trump appeared to give Bibi the cold shoulder after declining to offer the embattled Israeli prime minister encouragement or praise now that he faces potential defeat. Anne Gearan reports: \u201cSpeaking a day after Israeli elections that at best leave Netanyahu weakened, Trump seemed cool to the Israeli conservative who has touted his ideological lockstep with Trump as a chief reelection credential. Trump said he had not spoken to Netanyahu, a man he has described as a close friend. He then noted that the election is close while playing down Netanyahu\u2019s importance to the alliance between the United States and Israel. \u2018Our relations are with Israel, so we\u2019ll see what happens,\u2019 Trump told reporters traveling with him in California.\u201d\n\n-- Avidgor Lieberman\u2019s gamble has paid off: He could now play the role of kingmaker. From the AP: \u201cLieberman took the political gamble of his life when he spurned his mentor [Netanyahu] and forced an unprecedented repeat election. \u2026 Lieberman has emerged as the election\u2019s true winner \u2014 the one most likely to dictate the makeup of the next government. Lieberman passed up the post of defense minister in Netanyahu\u2019s government following April\u2019s election and refused to join the new coalition ... His exit left the prime minister one seat short of a parliamentary majority. Instead of allowing an alternative candidate a chance to form a government, Netanyahu dissolved parliament and called another snap election \u2014 launching a scathing campaign aimed at ending the career of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. But now it may turn out to be the other way around.\u201d\n\n-- Israel is a \u201cRussian-speaking country,\u201d Putin declared in Moscow, adding that the two countries share a common history and extensive family ties. (Moscow Times)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Trump toured a section of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a show of force on immigration ahead of the 2020 election. Philip Rucker, Nick Miroff and David Nakamura report: \u201cTrump\u2019s visit to the Otay Mesa area ... near Tijuana comes as the administration has felt emboldened after winning new legal authority to move forward in funding a border wall and, at least temporarily, gaining additional powers to enforce restrictions on asylum that could help blunt a record surge of Central American families. Capping a three-day road trip that included a campaign rally in New Mexico and several campaign fundraisers in California, Trump touted his team\u2019s progress in completing a 24-mile section of replacement barrier here. \u2018People are hearing about the wall and they\u2019re not coming up nearly as much,\u2019 Trump told reporters while standing near the 30-foot steel bollard fencing, which he called the \u2018Rolls-Royce\u2019 of border walls. \u2018People see this \u2014 it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m doing this \u2014 and they think, \u2018There\u2019s no reason to make that long journey up because we\u2019re not getting into the United States,' Trump added.\u201d\n\n-- The Pentagon warned of dire outcomes unless Congress paid for urgently needed military construction projects nationwide \u2014 the same projects that have now been canceled to fund Trump\u2019s border wall. Aaron Gregg and Erica Werner report: \u201cThe warnings are contained in Defense Department budget requests sent to lawmakers in recent years. They include potentially hazardous living conditions for troops and their families, as well as unsafe schools that would impede learning. In numerous cases, the Defense Department warned that lives would be put at risk if buildings don\u2019t meet the military\u2019s standards for fire safety or management of explosives. Even before $3.6 billion in construction funding was pulled to support a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, military buildings across the country often had been neglected in favor of other priorities. The defense spending limits that took effect after a 2013 budget deal designed to end a government shutdown starved the military\u2019s construction budget for years, officials and analysts say, meaning many construction projects are long overdue.\u201d\n\n\u00ad-- The Interior Department is transferring more than 500 acres of public lands to the Pentagon for construction of the border wall, reports the Wall Street Journal.\n\n-- Meanwhile, the U.S. military spent $184,000 at Trump\u2019s Scotland resort, according to documents released by the House Oversight Committee.
