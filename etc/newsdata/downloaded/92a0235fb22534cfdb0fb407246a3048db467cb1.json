(AP) - A restored edition of a pioneering, enduring American opera put through its paces in Michigan is making its official debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\n\n\u201cThe Gershwins\u2019 Porgy and Bess\u201d is set to premiere Sept. 23. The staging of the \u201cperformance edition\u201d is the culmination of a long-in-the-works project by University of Michigan\u2019s Gershwin Initiative.\n\nThe work with edited and corrected notes and other elements received a test drive last year on the Ann Arbor campus. Organizers say feedback from that performance helped develop a definitive score.\n\nUniversity musicologist Mark Clague says in a release the initiative, a partnership with the Gershwin families, ensures George and Ira Gershwin\u2019s works can \u201cbe heard as the brothers imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cPorgy\u201d is by the Gershwins, as well as DuBose and Dorothy Heyward.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A restored edition of a pioneering, enduring American opera put through its paces in Michigan is making its official debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
