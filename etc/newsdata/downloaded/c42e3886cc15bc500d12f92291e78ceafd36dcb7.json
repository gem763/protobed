It makes exceptions for serious criminal cases and those involving a judicial order.\n\nThe timing of the appeal gives the Supreme Court the ability to add the case to the nine-month term that runs through the end of June. The justices are already considering Trump\u2019s bid to rescind President Barack Obama\u2019s program of deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of people who came into the country illegally as children. The court will hear arguments in that case next month.\n\nCalifornia and the 9th Circuit have drawn Trump\u2019s repeated ire for thwarting his immigration policies. The state is among those challenging the president\u2019s rescission of the deferred-deportation program.\n\nThe new case is United States v. California, 19-532.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Greg Stohr in Washington at gstohr@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump\u2019s administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out a California immigrant-sanctuary law that restricts local police from helping federal authorities round up and deport people who are in the country illegally.In an appeal filed this week, the administration", "authors": ["Greg Stohr"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
