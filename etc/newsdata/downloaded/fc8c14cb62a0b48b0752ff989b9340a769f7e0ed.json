(TechRepublic)\n\nIt breaks its quarterly tracker into three segments: Certified reference systems and integrated infrastructure, integrated platforms, and hyperconverged systems.\n\nImage: IDC\n\nRevenues from hyperconverged systems sales grew 23.7% year over year during 2Q19, generating $1.8 billion-worth of sales.\n\nIDC said this amounted to 46.6% of the total converged systems market.\n\nOnce again Dell Technologies was the front runner with 29% of total market share, generating just over $533 million in revenue for the three-month period. Revenue growth, when compared to the same period in 2018, was just over 27%.\n\nBehind Dell was Nutanix, representing around 14% of the global market and revenue of $259 million. Nutanix's revenue was 6% less than in 2Q18, generating just over $275 million last year.\n\nCisco meanwhile experienced revenue growth of 46.8% -- boasting more than 6% of total market share and producing revenue of $114 million during the quarter.\n\nWhen viewing the statistics from the software ownership view, systems running VMware hyperconverged software represented $694 million in total 2Q19 vendor revenue -- 38% of the total market. This was up almost 40% year over year.\n\nSpecial Feature Special Report: Managing the Multicloud (free PDF) This ebook, based on the latest ZDNet / TechRepublic special feature, examines how to play multiple cloud providers off each other and what vendors and tools can help you manage multiple clouds.

This amounted to 16% of the total converged systems market revenue.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nHyperconverged systems sales surge in Q1, Dell Technologies, VMware, Nutanix lead\n\nDell Technologies portfolio companies dominated the hyperconverged space, according to IDC.\n\nWhat is hyperconvergence?
