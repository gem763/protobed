In 1952, for instance, the Federal Civil Defense Administration released Duck and Cover \u2014 a grainy black-and-white film instructing school-age children on the putative best practices to protect themselves in case of nuclear holocaust. Part animation, part live action \u2014 all of it morbid \u2014 the film, produced in conjunction with the National Education Association, opens with a two-bit jingle sung over a pizzicato bass. The singers introduce an anthropomorphic animated \u201cturtle by the name of Bert,\u201d who, they insist, \u201cwas very alert.\u201d \u201cWhen danger threatened him, he never got hurt,\u201d because \u201che knew just what to do\u201d: \u201cDuck \u2014 and cover!\u201d\n\nThat instruction reflected the then-common belief that \u201cducking and covering\u201d would mitigate the effects of a nuclear weapon, provided one was sufficiently far from ground zero. In subsequent years, nuclear tests rendered the dangers of airborne fallout more apparent. Contra Bert the Turtle, neither ducking nor covering would do a student much good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a wonder that Joel\u2019s \u201cCold War kids\u201d didn\u2019t lose their minds watching the film, which warns of flying shards of glass and a \u201cbright flash, brighter than the sun, brighter than anything you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Groups, reacting to the themes depicted in the film, expressed understandable concern about Duck and Cover at the time of its release. The Levittown (N.Y.) Educational Association and the Committee for the Study of War Tensions in Children, for instance, said that the film presented \u201cterrifying concepts\u201d and did an \u201cactual disservice to children.\u201d\n\nThose who objected to the film were met with predictable opposition. Forrest Corson, a Nassau County, N.Y., civil-defense spokesman, said that the \u201ccritics of Duck and Cover, in their misapprehension over the psychological effect of the film on schoolchildren, are unwittingly following the Communist party line laid down in official publications.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is more or less how you\u2019ll be treated if you question the propriety of mass-shooting drills in American schools in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is less the drills themselves than the gory and senseless manner in which they are conducted. Is it reasonable to prepare students for a natural disaster, an active gunman, or looming nuclear holocaust? Sure. But those reasonable motives don\u2019t guarantee reasonable results if they are not tempered by a sense of caution. Much of the new for-profit industry of school-shooting preparation, along with ideologically motivated members of the press corps, has lost that sense of caution, distorting public perception of the frequency of mass gun violence at schools and giving insufficient regard to the psychological damage that gruesome and frightening drills can cause to children.\n\nA representative example of the hysteria: CNN claimed in a July article that 22 school shootings had occurred in 2019. That is, on its face, a staggering number. Reading past the headline, however, you realize that the figure includes any incident involving a firearm on school grounds in which a student was injured or killed. School shootings, in the common understanding, are something more specific \u2014 mass terror of the kind seen at Sandy Hook and Columbine. Each victim of the 22 shootings CNN referenced represents a tragedy, of course, but the article is clearly meant to evoke a panic \u2014 have 22 Parklands happened this year alone? \u2014 that the facts do not justify.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA more realistic sense of the scope of the problem comes from James Alan Fox, a criminologist with decades of experience tracking violence in schools, who notes that there have been ten mass shootings at schools since Columbine, with a total of 81 fatalities, 64 of whom were students. A Washington Post article from October reports that this figure amounts to three students killed per year \u2014 a figure that is at once too high and, when compared with those for other dangers to a child\u2019s life, very low. More children, to choose one example from the piece, have been killed by lightning in the past 20 years than have been killed in mass shootings in schools. A study done by school-safety expert Stephen C. Satterly Jr. found that approximately 5 percent of education-related fatalities are the result of an active shooter. Thirty-six percent of fatalities, by contrast, are related to transportation to and from school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the parents of those 64 victims, the fact that their child\u2019s fate is relatively rare is no comfort, nor do I present it as one. The loss of those children demands our response \u2014 but it does not demand a response devoid of caution or prudence. If drills effectively minimize the potential carnage of a mass shooting without needlessly damaging students\u2019 psyches \u2014 some experts think they can, while others suggest the harms outweigh any benefits \u2014 then they should, with all expediency, become standard practice in schools nationwide. What we should not abide are the ghastly means by which some schools have seen fit to \u201cprepare\u201d students and teachers for a threat that is, by any metric, exceedingly rare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider an active-shooter drill from earlier this year in which, according to the Indiana State Teachers Association, \u201cfour teachers at a time were taken into a room, told to crouch down and were shot execution style with some sort of projectiles \u2014 resulting in injuries to the extent that welts appeared, and blood was drawn.\u201d\n\nGore likewise characterized a drill in one Missouri school district, which selected a handful of high-school students to act like shooting victims \u2014 lying \u201cdead\u201d on the floor, doused in fake blood, and covered with fake bullet wounds \u2014 as law enforcement \u201csearched\u201d for the \u201csuspect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least the students in the Missouri school knew that what they were seeing was not real. An unannounced active-shooter drill in Henrico County, Va., led one eighth-grade girl, convinced of her impending demise, to text her mother \u201cI love you\u201d as she prepared to face a mass shooter. The mother, rightfully furious with the school for staging the ordeal, later told reporters that her daughter\u2019s \u201cclassmates were crying, praying, and playing dead, believing they were about to be confronted by someone with a gun.\u201d\n\nIn another unannounced drill, fifth-graders at California\u2019s Raisin City Elementary School watched in horror as a masked member of the custodial staff, wielding a fake gun, traipsed about the campus, knocking on doors and windows as kids sat petrified inside. Kim Cooper, a fifth-grade teacher at the school, said, \u201cI had one boy, he was trying to be very quiet about it, but he was sobbing. You can imagine, I was upset, and I\u2019m a 48-year-old adult. But there in the back of my mind, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a drill. I think, \u2018My goodness, this could really be happening.\u2019\u201d One can only imagine what runs through a fifth-grader\u2019s mind when a masked assailant, visibly brandishing a firearm, bangs on a classroom door.\n\nThis is senseless. Why do we visit these spectacles on small children? It isn\u2019t as though reasonable alternatives do not exist: Gathering in a corner and locking the door seems to me a judicious drill, one that avoids these plainly abusive simulations of terror. Teaching adults how to respond to a live shooter \u2014 if the training does not involve mock-shooting them \u201cexecution style with some sort of projectiles\u201d \u2014 is not objectionable in itself. The sheer gore and inordinate realism of many drills, however, betray a tendency borne of panic, one that arises from the breathless calls to do something in the immediate aftermath of mass violence, even if that something abridges a person\u2019s constitutionally protected rights or \u2014 as here \u2014 unduly terrifies the public over a statistically remote possibility.\n\nNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, in the wake of the mass killing in Las Vegas, demanded that we talk about how to deal with the problem of gun violence \u201cnow,\u201d lest \u201cwe wait until cooler heads prevail.\u201d But if making fifth-graders think that gun-wielding custodians are trying to murder them is the fruit of such conversation, we ought to give the cooler heads a try.", "description": "Why are we terrorizing children over an exceptionally remote possibility?", "authors": ["John Hirschauer", "Ramesh Ponnuru", "Jay Nordlinger", "Charles C.
