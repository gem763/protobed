It's unwieldy for families that are trying to navigate through a system at a time when you're expected to make decisions at the worst point in your life, when your mind is like a fog.\"\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption Mr Cowan's body was found at the bottom of a fence by a private villa (left)\n\nItalian authorities concluded his death was an accident after he fell 8m (26ft) from a fence.\n\nBut his family do not believe it was an accident - a UK coroner ruled in 2017 that there may have been third party involvement - and an appeal against the Italian ruling is being heard in Como next month.\n\n'Uphill struggle'\n\nTrudy's case was one of those looked at as part of the report published by the Victims' Commissioner on Wednesday.\n\nDespite the dedicated team the Foreign Office set up four years ago to support people whose loved ones were killed or murdered outside the UK, Dame Vera Baird said it was still an uphill struggle.\n\nHer report cites the case of a bereaved mother who said the Foreign Office would not provide an interpreter for a court hearing in case they made a mistake - the family sued them.\n\nA woman whose partner died in India claimed the Foreign Office advised her to have the body cremated rather than repatriated because it was cheaper.\n\nDame Vera said families should get the same entitlements as they do in the UK.\n\nAmong 17 recommendations, she said families of those murdered abroad should be entitled to financial help under the criminal injuries compensation scheme.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said the proposal would be considered as part of a wider review.\n\nTrudy says she \"fully endorses\" the recommendations, although she says she would not personally have pursued financial compensation.\n\n\"As a family we just want the truth. We want justice for Russell,\" she says.\n\nThe Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, said it helps UK nationals with some of the issues cited by the report and urged anyone who is facing those problems to contact the charity.\n\nThe Foreign Office said it helped more than 22,000 British people overseas last year, including cases involving more than 4,000 deaths.\n\n\"We now have a dedicated team to support families of homicide victims, including funding translation where required,\" it added in a statement.\n\n\"We will look at what more we can do, including implementing many of these recommendations.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office said it had recently conducted a review of consular services and it would set out proposals shortly.", "description": "Support for families of British people murdered abroad can be \"patchy and inadequate\", a report says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CE3E/production/_107989725_file3-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
