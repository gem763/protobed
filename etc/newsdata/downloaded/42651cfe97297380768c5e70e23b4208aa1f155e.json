Due to the hit, Beckham sustained a sprained left ankle which kept him out of the season opener. When he did finally come back from the injury, Beckham played four games before breaking that same ankle, ending his season.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. says current and former #Browns players told him that #Jets DC Gregg Williams would tell them to take him out of the game when possible with hits. Flashback to this hit he took in 2017 preseason. Odell says it \"changed his life.\"pic.twitter.com/EpVykGiblj \u2014 NFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cI had players on this team telling me that\u2019s what he was telling them to do: take me out of the game, and it\u2019s preseason,\u201d Beckham said of Williams. \u201cSo you just know who he is. That\u2019s the man who\u2019s calling the plays. I had people who were here when he was here telling [them], \u2018If you get a chance, take a shot at him. If you can hurt him, I guarantee he\u2019s going to leave the game hurt,\u2019 and stuff like that. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ll never forget. It\u2019s something that changed my life forever.\u201d\n\nJonathan Vilma, a former Jets and Saints linebacker who played under Williams, defended his former coach on Friday on ESPN\u2019s Get Up.\n\n\u201cThere is no truth to (Beckham\u2019s comments),\u201d Vilma said. \u201cI was with Gregg Williams for three years, one of the best defensive coordinators I had. And he teaches physicality. He teaches aggression. And by the way, the hit on Odell Beckham that got him injured was a legal hit. We talk about going low because if a player can\u2019t run, a player can\u2019t score. But when you take those shots that are considered cheap shots by offensive players sometimes, it\u2019s really about going low and taking the legs out.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
