Teenagers use it to reply to cringey YouTube videos, Donald Trump tweets, and basically any person over 30 who says something condescending about young people \u2014 and the issues that matter to them.\n\nTeenagers have scrawled the message in their notebooks and carved it into at least one pumpkin. For senior picture day at one Virginia high school, a group of nine students used duct tape to plaster \u201cOK boomer\u201d across their chests.\n\nThe meme-to-merch cycle is nothing new, but unlike most novelty products, \u201cOK boomer\u201d merch is selling. Shannon O\u2019Connor, 19, designed a T-shirt and hoodie with the phrase \u201cOK boomer\u201d written in the \u201cthank you\u201d style of a plastic shopping bag. She uploaded it to Bonfire, a site for selling custom apparel, with the tagline \u201cOK boomer have a terrible day.\u201d After promoting the shirt on TikTok, she received more than $10,000 in orders.\n\n\u201cThe older generations grew up with a certain mindset, and we have a different perspective,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cA lot of them don\u2019t believe in climate change or don\u2019t believe people can get jobs with dyed hair, and a lot of them are stubborn in that view. Teenagers just respond, \u2018OK, boomer.\u2019 It\u2019s like, we\u2019ll prove you wrong, we\u2019re still going to be successful because the world is changing.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor is far from the only one cashing in. Hundreds of \u201cOK boomer\u201d products are for sale through on-demand shopping sites like Redbubble and Spreadshirt, where many young people are selling \u201cOK boomer\u201d phone cases, bedsheets, stickers, pins and more.\n\nNina Kasman, an 18-year-old college student selling \u201cOK boomer\u201d stickers, socks, shirts, leggings, posters, water bottles, notebooks and greeting cards, said that while older generations have always looked down on younger kids or talked about things \u201cback in their day,\u201d she and other teens believe older people are actively hurting young people. \u201cEverybody in Gen Z is affected by the choices of the boomers, that they made and are still making,\u201d she said. \u201cThose choices are hurting us and our future. Everyone in my generation can relate to that experience and we\u2019re all really frustrated by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGen Z is going to be the first generation to have a lower quality of life than the generation before them,\u201d said Joshua Citarella, 32, a researcher who studies online communities. Teenagers today find themselves, he said, with \u201cthree major crises all coming to a head at the Gen Z moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentials are more expensive than ever before, we pay 50% of our income to rent, no one has health insurance,\u201d Citarella said. \u201cPrevious generations have left Generation Z with the short end of the stick. You see this on both the left, right, up down and sideways.\u201d Citarella added: \u201cThe merch is proof of how much the sentiment resonates with people.\u201d\n\nRising inequality, unaffordable college tuition, political polarization exacerbated by the internet, and the climate crisis all fuel anti-boomer sentiment.\n\nAnd so Kasman and other teenagers selling merch say that monetizing the boomer backlash is their own little form of protest against a system they feel is rigged. \u201cThe reason we make the \u2018OK boomer\u2019 merch is because there\u2019s not a lot that I can personally do to reduce the price of college, for example, which was much cheaper for older generations who then made it more expensive,\u201d Kasman said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I can personally do to restore the environment, which was harmed due to corporate greed of older generations. There\u2019s not much I can personally do to undo political corruption, or fix Congress so it\u2019s not mostly old white men boomers who don\u2019t represent the majority of generations.\u201d\n\nKasman said she plans to use proceeds to pay for college. So do others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll definitely use the money for my student loans, paying my rent. Stuff that will help me survive,\u201d said Everett Solares, 19, who is selling a slew of rainbow \u201cOK boomer\u201d products. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen any gay stuff for \u2018OK boomer,\u2019 so I just chose every product that I could find in case anyone wanted it,\u201d she said.", "description": "In a viral audio clip on TikTok, a white-haired man in a baseball cap and polo shirt declares, \"The millennials and Generation Z have the Peter Pan syndrome, they don't ever want to grow up.\"Thousands of teens have responded through remixed reaction videos and art projects with a simple", "authors": ["Taylor Lorenz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JyEg4qVYN1YFiBlQlMkMkw--~B/aD0zMzAwO3c9MzMwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/1a60ac30-fb1c-11e9-baf4-467b7c8ab25c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
