In the film, Ms. Handler speaks onstage about her own privilege and her desire to have a conversation, but some of the students aren\u2019t as accepting.\n\n\u201cFeel free to edit this out,\u201d one student says in the film. \u201cBecause I\u2019m, like, really embarrassed to be here with you.\u201d\n\nMs. Handler said Wednesday that the students took her to task during the exercise but that she \u201cgets off\u201d on putting herself in uncomfortable situations and that she came out better in the end.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t welcoming, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cThere were black people in that room that were taking me to task saying, \u2018All you do is come in here and take, take, take. You making a documentary about white privilege is an example of your privilege.\u2019 And yes, that is correct, and it was good for me to hear.\n\n\u201cI get it. I am taking,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a lot and I want to give back, and I think it was a necessary conversation. And by the way, the whole problem is that white people don\u2019t want to be uncomfortable talking about these things. They don\u2019t want to ask the wrong questions, they don\u2019t want to offend black people, they don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing. Guess what? It\u2019s OK to be uncomfortable. We can afford to be a little uncomfortable after everything that\u2019s happened and stretch our brains and our bodies to put ourselves in situations that aren\u2019t natural \u2014 that aren\u2019t comfortable.\n\n\u201cWe all have to learn how to be better,\u201d she added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
