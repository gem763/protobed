As soon as comment is received this article will be updated.\n\nThe twins' father, Laurence Qwabe, told the Daily Sun that he advised his daughters not to talk to the media. He further added that both of them were home in KwaZulu-Natal where he has \"kept them in a safe place away from everyone, including the media\".\n\nHe further alleged that the Idols SA voting process was rigged and that the family felt like they were \"wasting money\" by keeping the twins in the competition and voting for them. He said that they decided to remove both sisters from the competition because \"they were going to lose their minds.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Sowetan Live, Laurence also declined to comment on the backstage ruckus.\n\nPhilly Kubheka, the head of publicity for M-Net's local entertainment channels, said \"the Qwabes are not available for interviews as we currently don't have access to them\".\n\nMzansi Magic was asked for comment about the alleged showdown that took place behind-the-scenes and the police's intervention, to which Kubheka responded: \"The Qwabe family and some of the fans were aggressive and demanded to have the twins removed during a live broadcast.\n\n\"The police had to be called as they threatened violence, and this is a public event, and we have to ensure everyone is safe.\"\n\nOn allegations made by the family that Virginia's exit was rigged, Kubheka responded with; \"Mzansi Magic, is satisfied as to the credibility of the Idols SA Season 15 voting process. The vote count and ranking on contestants were independently computed by Deloitte and Touche and confirmed against the vote results determined by M-Net.\n\n\"While the judges provide predictions and commentary on the show, they can in no way alter the computation and outcomes of the public vote. Mzansi Magic is also satisfied that the show is managed in a manner that respects our talent and crew and that no bullying is tolerated.\u201d\n\nALSO READ:\n\n'Idols SA' shocker: Viggy withdraws after her twin sister Virginia gets eliminated\n\n'Idols SA' sets the record straight about twin exit drama\n\nCompiled by: Herman Eloff, Leandra Engelbrecht, Thinus Ferreira", "description": "It turns out there was a lot more to the Qwabe twins' exit from the 15th season of Idols SA than the public was first led to believe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7437/e79b590b6cd64b6c837652aabb714995.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
