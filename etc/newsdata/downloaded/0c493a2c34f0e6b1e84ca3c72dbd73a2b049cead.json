People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier has chided his fellow federal leaders for even talking about something he deems to be entirely Quebec's business.\n\nAll the tip-toeing around Bill 21 is no doubt primarily a reflection of the fact that Bill 21 is overwhelmingly popular in Quebec, a province that will be pivotal to the outcome of the Oct. 21 federal election.\n\nBut it may also reflect the fact that the legal options available after Quebec's use of the notwithstanding clause are untested. As the only federal leader who hasn't slammed the door on intervening, Trudeau may want to see how some of the arguments fare in court before deciding whether to take the plunge.\n\n\"Unless you can persuade courts to breach new legal ground, there really isn't an obvious resolution,\" says University of Ottawa law professor Carissima Mathen.\n\n\"There are some new arguments that have been raised by some scholars but it would be unprecedented so the court would have to be persuaded. I think people agree it would be an uphill climb.\"\n\nThe National's Rosemary Barton takes an in-depth look at how Quebec could play out in the 2019 federal election. 11:26\n\nStill, Leckey says the courts have in the past found creative ways to address laws that judges have deemed \"deeply unjust.\"\n\n\"I think we'll see people trying arguments that have not been used because they've not been needed before,\" he adds.\n\nSection 33 of the charter provides that a legislature may declare that a law will operate notwithstanding certain rights and freedoms otherwise guaranteed in the Charter of Rights.\n\nOne argument now being advanced is based on the fact that the clause applies only to some sections of the charter. Important ones, sections that cover fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of religion, legal rights and equality rights, but not the entire thing.\n\nThe notwithstanding clause cannot be used to shield a law from other provisions of the charter, such as Section 28, which specifies that the rights and freedoms referred to in the charter are \"guaranteed equally to male and female persons.\"\n\nVarying opinions on charter sections\n\nBecause the secularism law affects Muslim women disproportionately, forbidding practically any distinctive clothing such as hijabs, Leckey says the courts might be persuaded that it violates Section 28.\n\nMathen believes that \"would be a tough sell\" because Section 28 has generally been seen as an interpretive guide to the charter, not as conferring a stand-alone right.\n\nAnother argument revives Supreme Court rulings from the middle of the 20th century, in which the top court ruled that provincial laws limiting religious freedom were a matter of criminal law and, as such, could only be enacted by the federal government.\n\nHowever, Mathen notes those rulings were made before the charter was enshrined in the Constitution in 1982. She doubts the courts would consider resurrecting them now.\n\nOther arguments being advanced revolve around two unwritten principles that underlie the Constitution \u2014 the rule of law and protection of minority rights, both of which, Leckey notes, were specifically recognized by the Supreme Court in the 1998 reference on the legality of Quebec secession.\n\nLeckey also argues that even if the notwithstanding clause ultimately prevents the court from striking down Bill 21, the wording of the clause doesn't preclude the court from issuing a judgment on the law. A damning ruling could have an impact on public opinion and dissuade the Quebec government from renewing its use of the notwithstanding clause in five years, as required by the Constitution.\n\nThen there's the nuclear option: the federal government could use its constitutional power of disallowance to invalidate the law, a power that hasn't been used in 75 years. At Confederation, the federal cabinet was given the authority to invalidate provincial laws, typically when they were against the national interest in some way or stepped on federal jurisdiction.\n\nThe power was once used fairly freely but the last time was in 1943, on an Alberta law that forbade land sales to Hutterites and \"enemy aliens\" in the Second World War.\n\nMathen says that would be \"beyond the pale\" and would likely \"provoke a crisis in terms of federal-provincial relations; not just Quebec would object to that.\"", "description": "National party leaders' reluctance to intervene in a court challenge to Quebec's controversial Bill 21 may have left the erroneous impression that there's nothing the federal government can do to try to stop the law that bans teachers, police and certain other public servants from wearing religious symbols at work.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5204145.1562609964!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/que-secularism-bill-20190617.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
