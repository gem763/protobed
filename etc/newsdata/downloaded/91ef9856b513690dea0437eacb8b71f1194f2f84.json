US forces are training and advising Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism operations against armed fighters.\n\nTrump had ordered a troop withdrawal in conjunction with the peace talks that would have left about 8,600 US forces in the country.\n\nLast month, US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad brokered a preliminary peace deal with the Taliban.\n\nBut a surge in Taliban violence and the death of a US soldier prompted Trump to cancel a secret Camp David meeting where the peace deal would have been finalised and declare the tentative agreement \"dead\".", "description": "Multi-pronged attack on checkpoint in Ali Abad district of northern Kunduz province set off hours-long deadly shootout.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2013/3/13/2013313144041635580_20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
