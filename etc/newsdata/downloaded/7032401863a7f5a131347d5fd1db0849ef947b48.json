We had a scan for her last year and she\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n(Image: Barcroft Media)\n\nOn the back of her miscarriage, Elizabeth decided to set up Speciallady, an organisation dedicated to educating women and young girls on gynaecological conditions and menstrual hygiene.\n\nShe said: \u201cI always say that Speciallady is my second baby. I want to be the voice of the voiceless for every woman out there who is going through symptoms like what I went through.\n\n\u201cMy condition means that I am high risk of cervical cancer or ovarian cancer, so I decided I wanted to live out my dreams.\u201d\n\nAs well as advocacy work in her home town, where Elizabeth recently presented to a local youth group, she now travels back to her native Ghana several times a year to share her knowledge with women in communities where talk of gynecological issues can still be taboo.\n\nShe said: \u201cAs an African woman, a lot of mothers die needlessly or people think these conditions are witchcraft.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now seeking Government agencies in Ghana to work with me now, I take sanitary towels and medical essentials in and talk to them about my experiences, and the response has been amazing.\n\n\u201cThese conditions affect girls as young as nine or ten years old, and they keep it to themselves. And by the time they realize what\u2019s going on, it can be too late.\n\n\u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t keep quiet. So my main focus is giving women that courage and that motivation they need for them to come out about their condition.\n\n\u201cDon't be quiet, don't keep it to yourself. Don't feel like you're the only one that's suffering. There are so many women out there in the same position.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the work done by Speciallady, visit www.specialladyawareness .com or find them on Instagram @speciallady8253", "description": "Elizabeth Amoaa also has two cervixes and two wombs and gave birth with doctors unaware she had two vaginas", "authors": ["Tom Midlane", "Jane Lavender", "Image", "Elizabeth Amoaa", "Alan Green", "Barcroft Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20677632.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Elizabeth-Amoaa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
