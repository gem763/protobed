51 Basecamp festival in Hiko, despite claims that \u201ca few thousand tickets\u201d had been sold, and on Saturday morning the rest of the event was cancelled due to \u201clack of attendance\u201d. The alternative \u201cAlienstock\u201d festival was set to continue for the full three days.\n\nThe original \u201cStorm Area 51\u201d Facebook page, which began as a joke, attracted more than two million people who declared they were ready to \u201cto see them aliens\u201d.\n\nIt sparked warnings from the US Air Force, which said it \u201cstands ready to protect America and its interests\u201d from anyone attempting to break into the site.\n\nThe page was taken down last month but police were prepared for around 30,000 people to turn up on Friday. However only a few hundred made it to the gates to the facility, according to officials.\n\nFive people were arrested, including two men who were found in the mountains inside the perimeter of base and a woman in her 60s who trespassed at one of the gates. Another 40 alien-seekers were ordered to disperse from the entrance near the town of Rachel at 3am on Friday.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

One man even performed a naruto run in the background of a live TV report from the Area 51 event.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great sense of community among everyone here,\u201d said John Derryberry, who drove with his girlfriend, Sarah Shore, from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOfficials confirmed there had been no reports of alien sightings or abductions so far.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Paul Oakenfold\u00a0performed for a crowd of just 100 alien hunters at Area 51 after a viral Facebook urging people to converge on the secret base to hunt extra-terrestrials.
