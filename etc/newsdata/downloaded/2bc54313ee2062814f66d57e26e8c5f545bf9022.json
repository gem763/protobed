Shape Created with Sketch. 10 best Nirvana songs 1/10 10. You Know You\u2019re Right (2002) That \u201cYou Know You\u2019re Right\u201d, recorded in January 1994 and not released until 2002, was Kurt Cobain\u2019s final song gives the track a morbid curiosity, and certainly it slips easily into the top end of their canon thanks to a tone of desolation that fits the narrative of a tortured superstar reaching the bottom of their downward spiral. In fact, the song is open to interpretation: a musical suicide note (\u201cI will crawl away for good\u201d) or a man making peace with his demons (\u201cIt\u2019s so warm and calm inside/I no longer have to hide\u201d). An enigma, to the end. 2/10 9. Come As You Are (1992) Nirvana\u2019s quiet/loud homage to the Pixies often verged on Weird Al pastiche, but Nevermind\u2019s second single \u201cCome As You Are\u201d is evidence that Kurt cribbed even further afield. The riff is such a close homage to Killing Joke\u2019s \u201cEighties\u201d there were rumours of a lawsuit, but Nirvana\u2019s wasted, nihilistic reworking helped it embed itself into the Nineties. 3/10 8. Drain You (1991) A Nevermind album track that became a fan favourite, the frantic and askew \u201cDrain You\u201d was written on the spot at Sound Studios, a minor masterpiece of impetuosity. Some have suggested it\u2019s a love song to Courtney Love, whom Kurt had met by this point and, judging by the chorus, they presumably bonded over a bizarre, ritualistic form of meat snogging. 4/10 7. In Bloom (1992) Just as Kurt always envisaged himself as a major creative force in rock music, he also predicted the jock invasion that would result. Hence the sardonic satire of \u201cIn Bloom\u201d, mocking the brainless mainstream rock fan who \u201clikes all our pretty songs\u2026 but he don\u2019t know what it means\u201d, even in a track designed to court them. \u201cIn Bloom\u201d was Nevermind\u2019s prettiest song \u2013 the jocks rightly flocked. 5/10 6. Sliver (1990) Concocted in a practice session between Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic and Mudhoney\u2019s Dan Peters, the febrile clash of grunge noise and indie-pop melody that is \u201cSliver\u201d is as Pixies as Nirvana ever got, and thus worked as a blueprint for their new Nevermind incarnation (as well as Green Day\u2019s entire career). Kurt decided to release it as a non-album warm-up single in 1990, a kind of ultra-pop warning shot for the more hardcore fans of debut album Bleach: \u201cI wanted to write the most ridiculous pop song I had ever written to prepare people for the next album.\u201d Job done. 6/10 5. About A Girl (1989) Even before \u201cSliver\u201d, Kurt had given fans glimpses of his inner pop fan, the kid that had liked The Beatles and ABBA just as much as Black Flag. He was worried about putting what he called \u201ca jangly REM type of pop song\u201d onto Bleach but actually presented one of Nirvana\u2019s most enduring tunes, a song about Kurt\u2019s fractured relationship with then-girlfriend Tracy Marander written after a night spent listening to Meet The Beatles on repeat. 7/10 4. All Apologies (1993) Intended as a gateway into the gnarled undergrowth of third album In Utero for the Nevermind fans that needed their hands held, \u201cAll Apologies\u201d actually acted as a reward. Survive the savagery and the final track unfolded like a comforting old-school treat of just the right flavour: melody and meat, wit (\u201ceveryone is gay\u201d) and weariness (\u201cmarried, buried\u201d) and a shrug of semi-atonement for putting more sensitive listeners through the grunge grinder for 40 minutes: \u201cwhat else could I write?\u201d 8/10 3. Heart-Shaped Box (1993) A song about children suffering with cancer, being trapped in an emotionally stifling relationship or Courtney Love\u2019s vagina, depending on who you believe, \u201cHeart-Shaped Box\u201d introduced In Utero with a brooding blast of surrealist rock therapy as vital as anything on Nevermind and, with all its imagery of internal organs, cancer-eating and umbilical nooses, a whole lot more visceral. 9/10 2. Lithium (1992) Hardcore Cobainistas consider \u201cLithium\u201d his definitive song \u2013 a quiet/loud ricochet of fragility and fury that takes in themes of schizophrenia, loneliness, self-hatred, lethargy and mildly scary sex. It actually concerns a man who turns to God when his girlfriend dies, but in splicing manic-depressive imagery with unstable, spasmodic dynamics, \u201cLithium\u201d is quintessential Nirvana. 10/10 1. Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) You know those hipper-than-thou lists that try to make out it\u2019s shallow, ignorant and predictable to rate a band\u2019s culture-defining behemoth of a track as their best? This isn\u2019t that list. Even removed from its impact and overplay as grunge\u2019s \u201cParadise City\u201d, \u201c\u2026Teen Spirit\u201d remains an elemental force of rock nature, the sound of 15 years of pent-up basement punk anger bursting onto MTV with a riff like a battle cry. Not bad for a song named after a deodorant. 1/10 10. You Know You\u2019re Right (2002) That \u201cYou Know You\u2019re Right\u201d, recorded in January 1994 and not released until 2002, was Kurt Cobain\u2019s final song gives the track a morbid curiosity, and certainly it slips easily into the top end of their canon thanks to a tone of desolation that fits the narrative of a tortured superstar reaching the bottom of their downward spiral.
