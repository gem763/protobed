Last week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said President Trump had ordered additional forces and hardware in response to the Sept. 14 cruise missile and drone attack against two Saudi petroleum facilities. U.S. officials blamed Iran for the attack, but haven't provided specific evidence. The Pentagon also has prepared to send two additional Patriot batteries and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad system, if they are needed in the region, said Mr. Hoffman. A Thaad system is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles before impact and cover a much broader area than a Patriot antimissile system, which is a so-called point defense system and is designed to cover a specific base or facility. U.S. and Saudi missile defenses in operation at the time failed to detect or stop the Sept. 14 attack. Many of Saudi Arabia\u2019s missile batteries were oriented toward its border with Yemen, where a war between Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi-backed government has spilled into the kingdom as Houthis lob missile attacks. But missile experts also said the combination of cruise missiles and drones used in the oil facilities attack also may have made the attack more difficult to detect. The plans for the additional deployments were reported by The Wall Street Journal Sept. 19. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. forces in the Middle East, had requested additional military capabilities in the region. But Mr. Esper and the departing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, have been measured in the U.S. response. The Pentagon over the last few years has been reducing the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East, reducing by tens of thousands the number of troops, as well as ships, antimissile batteries and other capabilities. Last year, then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pulled four Patriot batteries out of Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain, and aircraft carriers, long an enduring staple of the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf region, were withdrawn from the region for months at a time.
