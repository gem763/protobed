The Chinese Communist Party newspaper accused Apple of \u201cguiding Hong Kong thugs\u201d by making the app available. Apple originally pulled the app, but returned it after massive backlash against bowing to the demands of communist China.\n\nThe New York Post reports that tech giant Apple has come under criticism from China over an app that allows users to track the location of Hong Kong protests and police activity. The app, which Breitbart News reported recently was removed from the app store, was returned after a backlash from Apple customers and supporters of free speech, to the displeasure of the communist Chinese government.\n\nWhen the HKmap Live app was removed, Apple told the developers that: \u201cYour app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe company behind the Hong Kong app argued that other apps have taken exception to these rules as they simply provide location data, if these rules were to be applied universally location-based apps such as Waze would also be banned. Apple\u2019s argument was that the app is used solely to track police activity and protest movements. Messages on the app read: \u201cAfter the tear gas was applied, the police officer immediately returned to the police station.\u201d Another read: \u201cFour flashing lights parked at the police station door.\u201d Following backlash against the Silicon Valley giant, the decision was reversed several days later.\n\nNow the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper has criticized Apple with the People\u2019s Daily stating that the was designed by an outside supplier and available on Apple\u2019s online store and that it \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior.\u201d The People\u2019s Daily questioned if Apple was \u201cguiding Hong Kong thugs.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has ramped up efforts to crack down on protests in Hong Kong recently, pressuring Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Airways and the National Basketball Association in the United States to side against protesters. Recently, video game developer Blizzard recently banned Hearthstone eSports champion Ng Wai \u201cblitzchung\u201d Chung, a native of Hong Kong, for making comments in favor of the pro-democracy protests in the city.\n\nApple has a history of bowing to censorship demands from the communist Chinese government. In 2017, the company removed anti-censorship and VPN privacy apps from the Chinese app store at the government\u2019s request.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
