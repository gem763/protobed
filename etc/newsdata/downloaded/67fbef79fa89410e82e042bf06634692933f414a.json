In a rehearsal hall above its stages, Jones and Gardiner have prepared a \u201cChorus Line\u201d destined to look like no other in the musical\u2019s storied history. (Preview performances started Tuesday, and the official opening night is Nov. 5.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe got the chance to talk to the estate and share our knowledge of the piece, and to give them the comfort that we are not out to bastardize what Michael did,\u201d said Gardiner, Signature\u2019s longtime associate artistic director. \u201cWe wanted to look at it with new eyes and celebrate it in a different way.\u201d\n\nThe choreographic visions of such musical theater titans as Agnes de Mille, Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse tend to be fixed in the consciousness of the form\u2019s fans, so much so that any deviation from the norms can feel to purists like heretical departures in the liturgy. Oftentimes the original movement has been inscribed in notation, or recorded on video, or preserved in older dancers\u2019 muscle memory.\n\nOf late, though, a theatrical new guard has been casting aside reverence to put its own aesthetic on the foundational work in shows by the departed masters. Former New York City Ballet star Justin Peck, for example, was recruited to bring a fresh look to the dancing in 2018\u2019s Broadway revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s \u201cCarousel.\u201d Perhaps even more daringly, a Broadway revival early next year of \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d directed by Ivo van Hove, will feature dances by Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa DeKeersmaeker; the revered original musical staging was Robbins\u2019s masterwork.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd in Arlington, the revision is happening to the kick-turn combinations that Bennett and his co-choreographer, Bob Avian, created for the original \u201cA Chorus Line,\u201d which ran on Broadway for 15 years and 6,137 performances.\n\nIn a show with such a vaunted history and almost sacred dance scheme, a choreographer would be ill-advised not to include references to what\u2019s come before, and the Signature team does pay homage to Bennett\u2019s creation.\n\n\u201cYou also have an obligation to satisfy expectations,\u201d said the Broadway-tested Jones, choreographer of the current \u201cTootsie\u201d as well as a stage version of \u201cHoliday Inn,\u201d filled with Irving Berlin tunes, and the stage version of the film comedy \u201cHoneymoon in Vegas.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2018re not setting this up as something on Mars,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cA Chorus Line\u201d is the ultimate ensemble musical, a compilation of autobiographical material about the emotional travails and aspirations of Broadway dancers, as they audition for spots in the singing and dancing chorus of a new musical. The songs tell their personal stories, which were taken from interviews with real dancers, some of whom appeared in the original production. The dancing is an expression of the struggles of their youth and the precariousness of their careers.\n\nAnd so, on a recent weekday in the rehearsal studio, a diverse cadre of actor-dancers in their 20s and 30s was assembled for the \u2014 literally \u2014 step-by-step process of learning to dance an old show in new configurations.\n\n\u201cHeel, around, heel, toe, cross, together,\u201d instructed associate choreographer John T. Wolfe as the company dove into \u201cHello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love,\u201d the show\u2019s kaleidoscopic number about teenage rites of passage. With music director Jon Kalbfleisch at the rehearsal piano, dancers in a variety of familiar get-ups \u2014 tights and heeled shoes, sweatpants and sneakers, shorts and T-shirts \u2014 watched Wolfe dance the sequence, which ended with him collapsing loosely at the waist, arms dangling like a rag doll.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRemarkably, the two dozen dancers in the room picked up the gist of the routine pretty much flawlessly after seeing it just once. What the heck was this ability? To someone who couldn\u2019t even get himself over the pommel horse in phys ed, this looked like a superpower.\n\nIn this room, it\u2019s simply what choreographers expect dancers to be capable of, as they painstakingly construct a scene. \u201cBit by bit,\u201d as Stephen Sondheim would say. \u201c . . . Only way to make a work of art.\u201d\n\nJones paced the room in his stocking feet, studying arm and leg positions, offering tips on emotional context and reminders of the story arc of the song. In this instance, the song tells of the universal tribulations of growing into adulthood, of teenagers\u2019 discovery of sexuality.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Jones said, \u201cthis is another one of these chapters where your body is moving involuntarily, i.e., that something is starting to happen and you\u2019re not in control. So pursue the idea that your foot has a mind of its own.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn three long rows, with understudies, or \u201cswings,\u201d lining up in the back, the actors performed the sequence again. Some studied themselves in the wall-to-wall mirrors; others fixed their gaze on Jones, whose eyes moved from body to body as the dancers executed an arm-swinging gesture imitative of immature gawkiness.\n\nFor this section of the music, Jones gave them an interior narration to work with: \u201cIt\u2019s really just like \u2018I hate the world, everything\u2019s horrible, I\u2019m going to be 14 and I\u2019m miserable.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDenis has a language with his \u2018children,\u2019 \u201d said Vincent Kempski, who plays Al, a dancer auditioning alongside his wife, Kristine (Elise Kowalick), who can\u2019t sing. (Which they sing about, in \u201cSing!\u201d) \u201cWe\u2019re all like a giant unit,\u201d he added, as the cast scattered for lunch.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t take on that huge ego in rehearsals,\u201d said Maria Rizzo, the production\u2019s brassy, world-weary Sheila. \u201cAnd he\u2019s finding new colors in there.\u201d\n\nJones, 49, began his own musical-theater life as a dancer, having grown up in the Bay Area and moved east to attend New York University. He has been in \u201cA Chorus Line\u201d himself and, to get ready for the challenge of putting his stamp on the show alongside Gardiner, gathered a few dancer friends in New York to begin \u201cto discover\u201d the movement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSometimes, they help me understand what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said, adding that a step or a movement doesn\u2019t make full sense until he sees someone perform it.\n\n\u201cHello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love\u201d isn\u2019t sung until about halfway through the intermissionless musical, which builds to the heart-rending climax when Zach (Matthew Risch) makes his final picks and cuts. But it is where Jones began his own choreographic exploration, \u201cbecause of the amount of freedom in it, to dance that adolescent experience.\u201d\n\nGardiner said that he and Signature\u2019s artistic director, Eric Schaeffer, had long wanted to produce a revival of \u201cA Chorus Line.\u201d But they weren\u2019t interested in merely resurrecting the choreography of a show that is almost completely danced.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA lot of it is in the look of the show and my desire to not have actors stand in the same poses,\u201d Gardiner explained of those famous images of each dancer on the \u201cline,\u201d assuming a single characteristic posture. \u201cIt\u2019s also just distancing ourselves and making decisions based on the text. And in terms of Denis, it was the free rein to do this and still work with \u2018step, kick, kick, leap, kick, touch.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs any self-respecting musical-theater obsessive knows, those are the words Zach shouts again and again in \u201cI Hope I Get It,\u201d the opening number that puts the auditioning dancers through their initial paces.\n\n\u201cI want the group to do something that amplifies the lyric being sung,\u201d Jones explained, and in the rehearsal room, he strove to drive home that point. Over and over, like Zach, he drilled the actor-dancers in the combinations he was putting together before our eyes: Ninety percent of the choreography, he confided, is clear in his head before a rehearsal starts. The rest is improvisation, the alchemy in the moment.\n\n\u201cYes! That\u2019s the psychological journey!\u201d Jones declared as he prepared to refine the cast\u2019s work. \u201cSo now let\u2019s see if we can take the excess flippy-floppiness away from it. You can be suspicious of it: \u2018What is happening to my body?\u2019 So let\u2019s just see it slightly tighter.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe dancers got into position. The rehearsal piano struck up. And a choreographer called out for the umpteenth time, \u201cSix, seven, eight!\u201d\n\nA Chorus Line, music by Marvin Hamlisch, lyrics by Edward Kleban, book by James Kirkwood and Nicholas Dante.
