I thought he was going to have a cup of tea and chat.'\n\nJurors took four hours and four minutes to clear Mr Schubert, who broke down in tears and sobbed loudly. He is pictured with his mother\n\nLater in the trial, Mr Schubert took to the witness box so claim the woman 'enjoyed' the intimacy and showed no signs she was not consenting.\n\nJurors took four hours and four minutes to clear the defendant, who broke down in tears and sobbed loudly.\n\nAfter the verdicts were given last week, Mr Schubert broke down in tears and sobbed loudly.\n\nJudge Nigel Daly told jurors: 'As you can see trials with allegations such as these are very emotional affairs.\n\n'It is something which is very difficult to do, we greatly appreciate you have come to this court as members of the public to try other members of the public.\n\n'If you didn't do that then the criminal justice system simply could not continue.'", "description": "Christopher Schubert, who advertised himself online as a 'big cuddly bear looking for his mate', persuaded a jury at Oxford Crown Court the sexual encounter was consensual.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19738202-0-image-a-20_1571139400711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
