The brand\u2019s spring 2020 show opened with Danish model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2014 the \u201cqueen of cool,\u201d who made her Prada debut in 2005, long before Instagram \u2014 wearing a sheer white gauze skirt over a gray ribbed knit top, which buttoned all the way up to the collar. Her hair was slicked into side part, and her makeup was minimal. On the surface, it couldn\u2019t have been simpler, but the audience buzzed with excitement.\n\nAt first, this surprised me. But the buzz wasn\u2019t just about the look. \u201cOmg I was addicted to Freja in high school,\u201d a friend, who was born in 1993, DM\u2019d me after the show. But then I realized that to be obsessed with Freja in a pre-Instagram world meant that my friend actually had to take the time to look her up. She existed as a fully-formed person, not another avatar drifting by in an endless, mind-numbing feed.\n\nPrada\u2019s show was an ode to individuals like Freja. By stripping the collection down to basics \u2014 sharp blazers, slimming skirts, easy dresses \u2014 Mrs. Prada hoped to highlight \u201cthe power of women over clothing, and of style over fashion,\u201d as the show notes explained. In other words, it\u2019s not about how trendy or flashy the piece is, but how the wearer fit it into her personal wardrobe. Raw hems and necklaces made of pearls added to a sense of improvisation. \u201cAn instinct,\u201d as Prada calls it. Some might also call it cool.\n\nThis notion of radical simplicity was a continuation of the ideas Prada expressed at her most recent resort show, which took place in New York this spring. I found this iteration to be much more sophisticated and engaging, though. Instead of relying on the wearer, the clothes had a point of view. They refused to adhere to a time period, or theme, or any sense of neatness.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n\u201cIn this moment where everything is excess \u2014 too much fashion, too many clothes \u2014 I tried to work it so the person is most important,\u201d Mrs. Prada told press afterwards. You could read this \u201cless is more\u201d attitude as a response to our current climate crisis. (The show happened to take place on the same day as Greta Thunberg\u2019s plea to Congress.) And the collection did embrace resourceful craftiness, as well as recycled prints, silhouettes, and accessories from the \u201920s, \u201970s, and the \u201990s, which were combined in a single outfit.\n\nBut I also saw Mrs. Prada\u2019s desire to simplify clothes in order for women to play with them as a critique of influencer culture. It was a challenge to everyone chasing whatever look will scream the loudest on Instagram, as opposed to using their brains to put together an outfit. \u201cI felt so bad for them,\u201d said one editor afterwards, laughing at the expense of all the influencers in the audience who suddenly found last season\u2019s pop-horror, Bride of Frankenstein shirts out of style. As a way of dressing, it is unsustainable.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nAt Jil Sander on Wednesday night, designers Luke and Lucie Meier also offered their own interpretation of artful simplicity. (They opened a new white-wall-gallery-slash-store on Via Sant\u2019Andrea that same day as well.) Of course, minimalism is in the brand\u2019s DNA, but the duo took more risks this season, incorporating swirling prints and crafty embellishments. The collection had a more distinct personality than previous ones; I now have a better sense of the designers\u2019 point of view, and it\u2019s a convincing one. Still, I\u2019m not quite sure who Jil Sander woman is, other than well put-together.\n\nAs Cathy Horyn wrote in her review of Marc Jacobs last week, the best collections this season not only rethink how to dress, \u201cbut also how to be.\u201d Prada was to my wardrobe as Google docs were for Tavi: a step back, and a clean slate.", "description": "At Milan Fashion Week, Prada and Jil Sander offered a clean slate for spring 2020.
