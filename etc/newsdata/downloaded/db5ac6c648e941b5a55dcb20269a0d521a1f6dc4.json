Sometimes it doesn\u2019t match what other people envision, and that\u2019s where problems occur,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the flip side of that, when you are the coach and you don\u2019t have GM responsibilities and don\u2019t have total say, then you have to do the best you can with what you\u2019re given, and I think that\u2019s what we tried to do as a coaching staff.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe did not always see eye to eye about some of the decisions that were made,\u201d Gruden continued, noting that one could say that about the interactions between coaches and front offices at a lot of NFL franchises.\n\nAs for the team\u2019s decision to take Dwayne Haskins with the No. 15 pick of this year\u2019s draft, a move Gruden did not agree with, the former Redskins coach framed the decision around the team\u2019s need for a quarterback of the future with Case Keenum on a one-year caretaker contract and Colt McCoy recovering from a broken fibula.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDwayne is a great prospect, so we chose to take him as an organization,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cUnfortunately, when you take a guy at 15 people want to see him play right away. But it was our professional opinion [Haskins] wasn\u2019t ready to step in and play in the first five games of the season. It will take some time for him. He only played 13 or 14 games as a college player. He\u2019s very raw but he\u2019s very talented.\"\n\nAD\n\nGruden also noted that there were other college quarterbacks whom \u201csome people in that building liked later on in the draft, but we chose Dwayne and tried to make the most of it. He still has a chance to be a great player, without a doubt, he\u2019s just gonna take some time.\"\n\nGruden said he\u2019s going to spend the next month figuring out his next move and that he hopes to continue coaching.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just gotta leave my options open, try to talk to some people and see if there\u2019s anything I can do to help in some capacity somewhere doing something,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "But the team's former coach also would not speak badly of the team's culture in an ESPN Radio interview.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g6NFVPg13b1PN-A5y1jYExeTr9I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CPPRICHJBUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
