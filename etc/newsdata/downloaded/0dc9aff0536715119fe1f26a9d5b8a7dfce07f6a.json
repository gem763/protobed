Other challenges to the Earth\u2019s population\u2014including potential epidemics and an uptick in the number of people facing hunger\u2014were also discussed at the Race to Save World event, in which experts came together to discuss ways to tackle these problems and avoid the most dire of consequences.\n\nChatterjee said she hopes to see a world where she isn\u2019t worried about her son\u2019s future\u2014one without a warming climate and a society that only seems to care about individual well-being.\n\n\u201cCan we take care of each other or is it everyone out for themselves?\u201d she said at a panel discussion led by the Beast\u2019s national security reporter, Spencer Ackerman. \u201cI know in my 9-year-old son\u2019s lifetime that more storms will come... I want him in a society where people kind. There are people that don\u2019t want us to do this, and we need to knock them out of power so we can do it.\u201d\n\nChatterjee credited the grassroots climate movements for putting an emphasis on community and forcing those in power to engage in meaningful discussions about real solutions. Sarah Ladislaw, the director of the energy and national security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also said the \u201crich and powerful can\u2019t not have answers anymore\u201d on climate change.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve made remarkable progress on half-ass effort, what if we really try?\u201d Ladislaw asked. \u201cI think there\u2019s a big shift in people\u2014they didn\u2019t accept the problem before and now they accept the problem. Some of them have accepted their role in the climate problem, but now they have to take the steps to fix it. I still think there\u2019s a problem with this.\u201d\n\nWhile skepticism about \u201cneo-fascist\u201d systems has invigorated efforts to solve climate change, Elaine Kamarck\u2014director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution\u2014also warned at one of the event\u2019s fireside chats that trust in the government will be key to fomenting change worldwide.\n\n\u201cClimate change is the most challenging collective action problem\u2014we have collective action but no trust in government,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do this internationally and it\u2019s really hard when you have no faith in government.\u201d\n\nBut while trust in government may be necessary to bring the Earth back from the brink of devastation, experts warned that that only goes so far, as governments themselves are contributing to global epidemics and pandemics. Ron Klain, a former White House ebola response coordinator, said the current brand of \u201cisolationism\u201d favored by President Trump could mean \u201cdeath.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t engage with the world, the sicknesses will come here for sure,\u201d he said at a panel on epidemics moderated by Jackie Kucinich, the Beast\u2019s White House bureau chief. \u201cThe best way to control these things to help counties out\u2026 no wall we can build that\u2019s high or wide enough to keep infectious diseases out of this country.\u201d\n\nPanelists also spoke about the proliferation of anti-vaccine rhetoric, which has created breeding grounds for highly preventable viruses to spread.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an education issue. The data is there, science was irrefutable, but it\u2019s still a really growing problem,\u201d Justin McCarthy, senior vice president of patient and health impact at Pfizer, said. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to address a disease than to prevent it from happening.\u201d\n\nKlain disagreed, saying that the spread of vaccine misinformation is indicative of a \u201ccultural problem\u201d and a \u201cdeep conspiratorial mood\u201d that has permeated the U.S.\n\nIn a third panel led by national security reporter Erin Banco, experts spoke about the world\u2019s dwindling food and water resources\u2014which have been greatly affected by climate change, violence and conflict, as well as the volatile financial system, according to panelists. Vimlendra Sharan, a director at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, noted that world hunger has only increased in the past four years.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to feed the global population by starving the planet\u2014and if we starve the planet, we\u2019ll have dire consequences down the road,\u201d Sharan said. \u201cIf we do not do anything, we are in for very tough times.\u201d\n\nPete Pearson, the senior director for food loss and waste at World Wildlife Fund, said humanity needs to hold itself accountable for food waste as more people are going to bed hungry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a math equation. We\u2019re running at a deficit and you can\u2019t run spending like that. You\u2019ll hit a resource shortage,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cWe are placing value at food at every point, it has to be unacceptable to waste food from beginning to end.\u201d", "description": "Climate-crisis experts discussed solutions for the warming world, epidemics, and food scarcity at a D.C. event hosted by The Daily Beast and Pfizer.", "authors": ["Julia Arciga"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571946168/191024-race-to-save-the-world-tease_1_wsclu1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
