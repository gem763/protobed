Claudia L\u00f3pez won the race for mayor of Bogota on a platform promising to combat corruption and advance equal rights for minority communities.\n\nThe Alianza Verde candidate captured over 1.1 million votes, or about 35 percent of the vote, defeating runner-up Carlos Gal\u00e1n by 2.7 percentage points.\n\nWith her victory, L\u00f3pez also becomes the first openly lesbian mayor of a capital city in Latin America, a region slowly advancing in improving LGBT rights but where long-standing cultural biases and inequality remain barriers.\n\n\u201cThis is the day of the woman,\u201d she said to a jubilant crowd. \u201cWe knew that only by uniting could we win. We did that. We united, we won and we made history!\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Earlier this year, a man was caught on camera pushing and screaming profanities at two gay men in their early 20s hugging and holding hands at an upscale mall in Colombia\u2019s capital.\n\nBlanca Duran, a former city politician, told the El Espectador newspaper that with L\u00f3pez\u2019s win, Bogota is \u201csetting an example for the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is showing that it is a city with respect, with diversity, in which we can advance rights,\u201d she said.\n\nCentrist and progressive party candidates won several important posts in Colombia\u2019s local elections, the first since the signing of a historic peace accord with leftist rebels. Conservative former President \u00c1lvaro Uribe acknowledged his party\u2019s setback, stating on Twitter that \u201cI recognize the defeat with humility.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Colombia's capital city elected Claudia L\u00f3pez on Sunday in what is being hailed as an important advancement for women and LGBT rights.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bogota-colombia-female-mayor.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
