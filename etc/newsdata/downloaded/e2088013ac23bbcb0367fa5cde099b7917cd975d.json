His brother, Ian, posted on Facebook last night: \u201cAt last, the time has come! Join us tomorrow at the Serowe bus rank at 11am as we delightfully welcome Tshekedi Khama to the Botswana Patriotic Front.\u201d\n\nTo Ian Khama, this was victory. He had recently embarked on a campaign to get his brother to resign from the BDP. He went as far as going to Tshekedi\u2019s constituency in Serowe West, one of the areas that falls under him as the Bangwato chief, asking them if they wanted his brother to remain with BDP.\n\nIt was, however, not clear if Tshekedi\u2019s decision to resign from the governing party was as a result of pressure from his brother and constituency. He has not spoken on the matter and has not responded to messages sent to him by City Press.\n\nTshekedi\u2019s departure from the BDP came just a day before the Botswana Independent Electoral Commission\u2019s deadline today for the submission of candidates\u2019 names by political parties, and few days before he was to be unveiled as the governing party\u2019s member of parliament candidate in his constituency on Saturday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Tshekedi\u2019s name would be submitted to the IEC for the BPF.\n\nHis brother left the BDP more than three months ago following a fall-out with his successor as Botswana president and party leader, Mokgweetsi Masisi.\n\nKhama handpicked Masisi to succeed him but reports suggested that their friendship soured within months of the latter being at the helm and allegedly not toeing the line and taking any advice or orders from the former president.\n\nIan Khama is a former chief of the Botswana army. He was appointed deputy president to Festus Mogae from 1998 to 2008. He then took over from Mogae as the country\u2019s fourth president in 2008 and in 2012 appointed his brother, Tshekedi, as minister of environment, conservation and natural resources and tourism.\n\nMasisi took over from Khama when his term ended last year and moved Tshekedi to the ministry of youth and sports. Tshekedi remained with the BDP after his brother left and has been seen at the party\u2019s rallies campaigning until he suddenly resigned yesterday.\n\nThis, to some extent, can only mean that elections contest is getting even tougher for the BDP which has led the Botswana government for 53 years.\n\nCentral District, where the Khama brothers come from, is a known stronghold of the BDP and home to 19 of Botswana\u2019s 57 constituencies.\n\nThis is the area where Ian Khama\u2019s campaign has been strong with the aim of using his own people to unseat his father\u2019s party.\n\nIt was also his first stop of consultation with his supporters before announcing his resignation from the BDP after the declared their support and to follow him wherever he decides to go. While at it, Khama has not only been working against the BDP but also formed an alliance with his former nemesis, the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), which was an official opposition party during his presidency and very critical of his leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the BDP spokesperson Kentse, said of Tshekedi Khama\u2019s departure last week: \u201cGood riddance \u2026 sometimes it is better for your enemy to be at a distance. He is now a member of the opposition and will be treated as such.\u201d\n\nKentse said one of Masisi\u2019s priorities was to fight corruption. He acknowledged that \u201ccorruption happened under the BDP but who was the head?\u201d\n\nHe asked this rhetorical question whose answer will automatically be Ian Khama as the last leader of BDP and government before Masisi.\n\n\u201cIf a leader is willing to fight corruption then the entire system will fight corruption. People of Botswana understand our agenda \u2026 Masisi deserves a chance to show us what he can do for us,\u201d Kentse said.\n\nMore than 900 000 Botswana voters will determine who they prefer to lead their government in less than a month when the diamond rich country goes to the polls on October 23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The sons of Seretse Khama, Botswana\u2019s first president, will for the first time go to the elections in party colours opposed to the party co-founded by their father 58 years ago.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8608/616a2ae055ad45969d508a7357d795f0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
