The friend said \u201cwhy not? There aren\u2019t many Native American actors.\u201d\n\nInstead of a deterrent, Studi took that as a plus.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018OK, so not a whole lot of competition then,\u2019\u201d Studi, 71, said laughing. \u201cI thought why not take a leap and I did. And things turned out well.\u201d\n\nAlthough there was no way he could have known it at the time, the Tulsa, Oklahoma native came at the perfect time too. Hollywood had started to move beyond its deplorable past of casting white actors for indigenous roles and looking for more authenticity in casting. Some of his first films included \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d \u201dThe Last of the Mohicans\u201d and \u201cGeronimo: An American Legend\u201d that would lead to a fruitful 30-year career that\u2019s still very active.\n\nThis Sunday, Studi will make history as the first ever Native American Oscar recipient at the 11th annual Governors Awards, alongside fellow honorary Oscar honorees David Lynch and Lina Wertm\u00fcller. (In 1982, Cree musician Buffy Sainte-Marie, who was born in Canada, became the first indigenous Oscar winner for co-writing the music to best song winner \u201cUp Where We Belong.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI feel very honored about it,\u201d he said on a recent phone call from Santa Fe, New Mexico, which he has called home for the past 26 years. He just feels more comfortable living outside of Los Angeles, he said.\n\nStudi came to acting somewhat late in life. He went to agriculture school, served in the Oklahoma National Guard and even went to Vietnam before he stated dabbling in theater and local educational television.\n\n\u201cI had a life before getting into this business. A non-acting life,\u201d Studi said. \u201cAnd it turns out that life has served me well. I can connect with characters I play simply by referencing real life. It\u2019s been very helpful over the years to have experienced life outside of entertainment.\u201d\n\nWhen he arrived in Los Angeles, a now defunct organization called the American Indian Registry helped him get his start. The group promoted Native American actors and made opportunities for them to meet agents. It led to Studi securing representation and booking Kevin Costner\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cDances With Wolves,\u201d which then put him on Michael Mann\u2019s radar for what would be his most memorable role to date: Magua in \u201cThe Last of the Mohicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank Michael Mann for having an open mind in terms of expanding the character of Magua to the point that he was sort of an antihero, but he had his qualities. He had his reasons for doing what he was doing,\u201d Studi said. \u201cHe and the writer were open to that were creating more of a three-dimensional character.\u201d\n\nMann would then go on to cast Studi again in \u201cHeat\u201d as an Los Angeles police detective - a somewhat rare opportunity for Studi to play a character who wasn\u2019t primarily defined by his ethnicity.\n\n\u201cIt can be frustrating,\u201d Studi said. \u201cI can understand the idea of wanting to get away from leathers and feathers. But it\u2019s a double-edged sword in its own way. Westerns and or period pieces in which Native Americans are portrayed have been the starting point and the bread and butter of Native American actors. Fortunately I\u2019ve been able to cross over in a few roles over the years. Sometimes it\u2019s a matter of two steps forward and one step back.\u201d\n\nWith a slew of projects just wrapped or in the works, Studi doesn\u2019t appear ready to slow down or retire anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI retire every time we wrap a film,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve had a taste of retirement and I\u2019m not sure I enjoy it all that much.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When Cherokee actor Wes Studi was thinking about moving to Los Angeles to take a shot at being an actor in the 1980s, he asked a friend if it was a good idea.
