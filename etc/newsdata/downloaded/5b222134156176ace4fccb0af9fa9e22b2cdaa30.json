We want him at 100 percent when he\u2019s ready, so there\u2019s no exact timetable for his return,\u201d Carolina coach Ron Rivera said. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re going to go forward with Kyle [Allen] as our starter.\u201d\n\nFriday afternoon, in a raw, 15-minute YouTube vlog, Newton released his side of the story.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cThis is my opportunity to be transparent to the viewer, to Panther Nation, to the people who follow me, to the people who hate me,\u201d he said, looking directly at the camera while smoking a cigar and sipping red wine.\n\nNewtown explained that his years-long focus on rehabbing his shoulder distracted him from his new foot injury, which he initially tried to play through.\n\n\u201cAll my attention has been shoulder, shoulder, shoulder... fast forward to preseason game 3, and something happened \u2013 the unthinkable, so to speak. Something else got hurt.\u201d\n\nCam Newton comes to terms with needing rest\n\nBut after paying Weeks 1 and 2 of the regular season, with Carolina losing both efforts, he didn\u2019t feel like himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking to myself, I can\u2019t run. It\u2019s one thing to have the ability to run, and not, rather than to have opportunities to run, and you can\u2019t,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe didn\u2019t seem Cam\u2019s mark on that game.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I\u2019ve played this game one way, the only way I know how to play, and at this particular point in time, that No. 1 that\u2019s out there, hasn\u2019t been that same person.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, he\u2019s shifting his focus to the team\u2019s long-term success. Newton trusts that his team will be successful without him, and is confident he needn\u2019t rush back before he\u2019s ready. In the interim, he\u2019ll help out his teammates wherever he can.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m able to get the time off for me to heal and get back to 100%, then I have no doubt in my mind everything that we want as a team can still be accomplished,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, I cannot be the best player for this team if I\u2019m ailing an injury that needs time to heal.\u201d\n\nNewton, 30, also said it was hard for him to realize that he needed to take a step. He watched film, however, from his early-season starts, and found it hard to look at.\n\n\u201cI needed to see that me at 80% is not okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to get back to 100%.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I get older, I realize it\u2019s okay to take time off,\u201d Newton added. \u201cThere\u2019s been quarterbacks for years \u2013 there\u2019s been players for years \u2013 who has this realization with themselves, and looking at those situations also gave me comfort in not rushing back... I\u2019ve decided that I will take time away from the game. This is me being a bigger person and being real with myself and saying, \u2018look, what\u2019s the ultimate goal that you\u2019re trying to accomplish?\u2019\u201d\n\nNewton goes on to say he could be out any number of weeks: \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019ve just got to get right. I\u2019ve got to get right.\u201d\n\nA few weeks isn\u2019t so bad, however, compared to what Panthers owner David Tepper suggested in January might have been necessary for his quarterback: an Andrew Luck-style year off from the sport to rehab his shoulder. So there could be a silver lining yet.\n\nCam Newton went long on his YoutTube channel regarding the \"truth\" about why he's sidelined.
