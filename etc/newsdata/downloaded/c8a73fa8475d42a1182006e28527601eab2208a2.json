Credit to my boys for keeping going.\u201d\n\nLines were clearly drawn, with both Japan and South Africa knowing precisely what they had to do to reach next weekend\u2019s semi-final against Wales - this was always going to be a battle between the Boks\u2019 forwards and the Brave Blossoms\u2019 lightning backs.\n\nThe first half was close \u2014 mostly due to South Africa\u2019s profligacy with the line at their mercy \u2014 and the teams had gone in with only two points separating them after an unconverted fourth-minute try by winger Makazole Mapimpi was countered by a Yu Tamura penalty for Japan.\n\nBut in the event, after an exhilarating first 40 minutes, the Japanese team ran out of energy, ideas and, finally, hope.\n\nThey had not been tackled as fiercely this World Cup as they were on Sunday night. Nor had they faced such a disciplined, well-organised defence.\n\n\u201cWe knew how fast they can play,\u201d Kolisi said. \u201cThey have a style that is fearless so we knew we had to get up... that is what we pride ourselves on, our hard-working defence.\u201d\n\nWhere the South Africans had been careless early on \u2013 they could have gone in at halftime three or four tries to the good \u2013 they tightened everything up in the second period to devastating effect.\n\nFaf de Klerk, who had helmed the South Africans artfully throughout, added a second try on 66 minutes and Mapimpi added his second four minutes later.\n\nPollard converted one try and slotted three penalties in the second period, all unanswered.\n\nJapan could never hope to maintain the frenetic pace with which they had harried South Africa early on and departed the tournament beaten but with a whole new army of fans for their exciting, free-flowing rugby.\n\n\u201cJapan is only going to get stronger,\u201d said Leitch, a try-scoring veteran of that pivotal match in Brighton four years ago.\n\n\u201cI am extremely proud of what we have done. We have done the country proud.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa must now regroup for their Yokohama semi-final against Wales who earlier recorded a 20-19 victory over 14-man France, who had lock Sebastian Vahaamahina sent off in Oita.\n\n\u201cWe want to try and go all the way,\u201d coach Rassie Erasmus said. \u201cWe now have Wales... so tomorrow we will start on them.\u201d", "description": "There was never any shortage of courage, but not even the bravest of blossoms could punch through Springbok brawn on Sunday as South Africa reached the Rugby World Cup semi-finals by beating Japan 26-3 and ending their dream run at their home tournament.", "authors": ["Ossian Shine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443035931&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0I3-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
