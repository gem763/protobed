The 380 confirmed and probable cases now span 36 states and still include six deaths, as reported earlier. The CDC added that the current number of cases \u201cis expected to increase as additional cases are classified.\u201d\n\nWhile health investigators are clearing the air around the clinical aspect of the cases, the cause is still foggy. Though all the cases are associated with vaping, investigators have struggled to identify specific vape products or ingredients that tie all the cases and symptoms together.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ars Technica", "Arstechnica.Com Science Cdc-Refines-Definition-Of-Vaping-Linked-Illnesses-Lowers-Case-Count"], "top_image": ""}
