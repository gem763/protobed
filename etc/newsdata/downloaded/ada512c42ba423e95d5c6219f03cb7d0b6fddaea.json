Police have said they were unaware of any such attacks.\n\nEarlier this month, a minister proposed the introduction of the death penalty for gay sex, a threat retracted by the government after international donors condemned the move.\n\nA tainted imperial legacy that fuels the oppression of gay people in Africa | Patience Akumu Read more\n\nActivists said the raid was a step up by the police. \u201cNormally we will hear of maybe one arrest of someone from the community under these anti-gay laws in one month, but it is really unusual to see 16 people charged like this,\u201d said Frank Mugisha, the executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda.\n\n\u201cThe 16 activists have been held by police for over 48 hours, forced to undergo anal examinations. We are expecting them to be produced before court today.\u201d\n\nThe men all worked for the charity Let\u2019s Walk Uganda. They were initially taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d after a crowd yelling homophobic slurs surrounded their office, rights groups said. Police said the group was detained after they were alerted to \u201cillegal activities\u201d by the community.\n\nUnder the Ugandan penal code, any person who has \u201ccarnal knowledge against the order of nature\u201d or anyone who accedes to anal sex is liable to life imprisonment.", "description": "Men could face life in jail as campaigners warn of escalating attacks on sexual minorities", "authors": ["Reuters In Nairobi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddc586aa1dd9ffb212ecc78f8f0138f758cc9322/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e87404106e6f4ef422cd14786191e249", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
