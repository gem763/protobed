He\u2019s just turned 21, so I think, if anyone is getting too excited about this, they should calm down because he\u2019s started five games for us.\n\n\u201cWhat he needs to do is work, work daily, work to show within the group that he deserves to play as all the players do, so that\u2019s what the focus on everyone is.\u201d\n\nPulisic was not the only high-profile player not involved at Lille, with Ross Barkley not in the 18.\n\nAnd Lampard added: \u201cThis is one of my difficult problems in this job. I have good players and everyone has a story.\n\n\u201cPulisic has a price tag, Barkley is an international player, Mason Mount is an international player, Callum Hudson-Odoi just signed a new contract, Bayern Munich wanted to buy him last summer and he\u2019s an international player.\n\n\u201cRuben Loftus-Cheek will come back and be an international player. I can\u2019t pick them all. All I have to demand of them is that they show me in training and show me they are worthy of the place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just my job. Next week you might be asking me about two other names. It\u2019s the competition that we have.\u201d\n\nThe return to fitness of Hudson-Odoi has further pushed Pulisic down the pecking order, although the England youngster was recently warned by Lampard.\n\nAfter the 7-1 win over Grimsby, the Chelsea boss admitted the 21-year-old had areas where \u201che needs to learn\u201d if he wants to become a regular.\n\nSince then, Hudson-Odoi has been an impact substitute on two occasions for the Blues, setting up goals in the wins over Brighton and Lille.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really pleased and that has to continue. We can all focus on Pulisic from the other day but Callum\u2019s the same and I have to speak in the real world when I speak to them and sometimes as a manager you want more,\u201d Lampard said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be honest and the players have to react and Callum has now come on with two assists in the games he\u2019s come on and that\u2019s what you want to keep pushing.\u201d\n\nOlivier Giroud is another who has struggled for game-time since Lampard took over at Stamford Bridge, but the Frenchman was praised by the ex-Derby boss.\n\nLampard added: \u201cMy relationship is really good with him. He\u2019s a great professional, trains at a level everyday, great in the dressing room and in the game passes on experience.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to play. I understand that and accept that. I was one of the worst. I hated not playing. I was terrible so on this side of the fence I get it, but all I want to see is positivity, how they are daily in the place and I\u2019m seeing that.\n\n\u201cAll good teams need a big squad in these modern days to try and be a successful team and it will need everyone pulling through the season in the same direction whether playing or not and, to be fair to Oli, he\u2019s been fantastic and we\u2019ll need him.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Christian Pulisic needs to \u201cwork daily\u201d to show he deserves to play regularly for Chelsea, manager Frank Lampard has said.
