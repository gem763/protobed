Much more of this and Walcott will rebuild his reputation.\n\nMason Holgate and Richarlison struck the second-half goals but Walcott was the catalyst for improvement after replacing the ineffective Moise Kean at half-time.\n\n\u201cHe made a big impact again,\u201d said Everton manager, Marco Silva.\n\n\u201cThe change we made at half-time and the way we built our attacks was faster and gaps more clear.\n\n\u201cTheo was always important for me even if he was not sometimes playing or starting, He knows that. He got his chance in the last game because he deserved it. He is in a very good moment.\u201d", "description": "Everton 2 Watford 0", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214541615-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oLxVMM-N2Dh3uu4C0ivbnMw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
