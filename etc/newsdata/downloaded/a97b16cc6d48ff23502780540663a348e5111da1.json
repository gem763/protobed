It felt like a boulder was stuck in my chest.\n\nStill, I had work to do. I scribbled details in my reporter\u2019s notebook \u2013 visitors wiping tears, shackles displayed behind glass cases, fish sizzling on glowing coals, children skipping along the sand.\n\nAt one point, I got caught up, swinging my hips and shuffling my feet in the dirt, dancing to local music with Angolans who swore I must be one of them.\n\n\u2018\u2018Maybe I am,\u201d I thought, then kept on dancing.\n\nBut later, in the quiet of my hotel room and in the dim light of a lamp, I sought the answer. I knew my ancestors were from Africa, but where? Was I possibly at home in Angola?\n\nA few weeks earlier, I had taken a DNA test. That night in my hotel, I searched for an email with the results. It popped up. My heart jumped.\n\nBlack history and a trip to Angola: Wanda Tucker's search for answers Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nMy search was sparked by an assignment from USA TODAY to write about a family in Hampton, Virginia, who believes its members are descended from the first Africans brought to the English colonies in 1619. If their claim is true, they are connected to a founding American family, heirs of a legacy history has ignored.\n\nI was in Angola to chronicle Wanda Tucker's journey to the country where she believes her ancestors lived. For many African Americans like the Tuckers, the search for family roots can seem out of reach. Oral history was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a major link to our past, but the paper trail can go cold.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Africans were enslaved in America. Wanda Tucker believes her relatives were the first Read more\n\nI was brought into the story late in the process through a mix of circumstances. Still, it appealed to me. Everything happens for a reason.\n\nSo this spring, I ducked into a phone booth in the press gallery at the U.S. Capitol to join a conference call with editors and colleagues. When the editors mentioned the name of the family we were featuring, I thought, hmm. My late grandmother\u2019s name is Ernestine Tucker. Then they mentioned the Tuckers were from Hampton. My grandmother\u2019s people were from a place near Hampton. Even more interesting, I thought.\n\nI mentioned all these coincidences to my colleagues. We all laughed.\n\nMaybe you should take the DNA test, an editor suggested. We laughed again.\n\nBut then it wasn\u2019t so funny.\n\nWhat if, in this world of six degrees of separation, I was related to the family I was writing about?\n\nBehind the Scenes of 1619: DNA's role in family history Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nFamily story untold\n\nOn a drizzling June afternoon, I walked with Wanda Tucker and her cousin Walter Jones under huge oak trees in the Tucker family cemetery in Hampton. They pointed to headstones that dated to the 1800s. They explained how the cemetery had become a symbol of their family legacy.\n\nI listened, asked questions, jotted notes.\n\nFor Wanda and Walter, believing they are descendants of the first Africans here meant reclaiming a piece of stolen history. It afforded them some celebrity and tremendous pride.\n\nSo as I interviewed the Tuckers and pored over their photo albums, I quieted the part of myself that wondered about my own origins. Reporters are trained to stay in the background.\n\nBut that night, in a hotel room not far from the cemetery, I called my oldest cousin on the Tucker side of my family.

She was part of a team from USA TODAY who visited this summer with Father Gabriele Bortolami, an Italian Capuchin priest and professor of anthropology at Agostinho Neto University in Luanda, Angola. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nI\u2019ve been a reporter for more than 30 years. I\u2019ve been on Air Force Two, in the White House and on the floor of the chambers in the U.S. Capitol. I\u2019ve interviewed members of Congress, presidential candidates, civil rights icons, governors, secretaries of state.\n\nThis call was personal.\n\nI asked her about her grandfather \u2013 my great-grandfather.\n\nShe told me his name was Edward Thomas Tucker. He owned a farm, was a shoemaker and helped build a school for \u201ccolored\u2019\u2019 children.\n\nHe was also a Baptist preacher and a strict one. He and his wife had 10 children, including my grandmother, who was a twin.\n\nThey lived in a house that he built, with a porch and a huge oak out front. Tracks from the Norfolk & Western Railway Co. cut through the yard.\n\nI learned more from that two-hour conversation than I probably would have at any family reunion. Unlike my mother's side of the family, I don\u2019t remember the Tucker side hosting reunions.\n\nThey didn\u2019t say anything at all about Grandpa Tucker\u2019s family, Selidia said. \u201cNothing.\u2019\u2019\n\nFinding out more felt like a daunting task. Records weren\u2019t always kept for African Americans; some were lost, destroyed or tucked in family bibles. For years, the census didn\u2019t even name them. They were simply listed as slaves or \u201cfree colored.\u201d\n\nDespite those challenges, more African Americans have launched searches, turning to DNA tests, musty court records, and libraries, hungry for information .\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this wanting,\u2019\u2019 Mary Elliott, curator of American slavery at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture, told me. \u201cPeople want to be connected to their origins.\u201d\n\nUntil a month ago, I didn\u2019t know the names of some of my forefathers right here in America, nor where my ancestors came from in Africa. I wasn\u2019t sure I could trace much of my family history.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe local search\n\nIn a brightly-lit room just up the stairs at the Library of Virginia in Richmond, my sister Selina and I pulled opened metal cabinets and plucked out cartridges of microfiche.\n\nA friend had suggested the library because it housed records from across the state. The reels held information about births, marriages, deaths and deeds.\n\nOne by one, we carefully loaded the microfiche. It slashed through the air and back on the reel.\n\nOn reel No. 40 of the Virginia marriage records, we confirmed that Edward Thomas Tucker, my great-grandfather, married Lucy Stokes on Dec. 30, 1903.\n\nOn reel No. 13 of the old birth index, we learned that Edward, who was listed as colored, was born to Jack and Mary Ellen Tucker in Nottoway County.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Harriett Barfield Black, Berry's 101-year-old great aunt, showed the Barfield family tree in Atlanta in April to her great nieces Amaya Berry (left) and India... Harriett Barfield Black, Berry's 101-year-old great aunt, showed the Barfield family tree in Atlanta in April to her great nieces Amaya Berry (left) and India Brodie (right). In 1941, Barfield Black was the first graduate of Fort Valley State University, a historically black college in Georgia. She is the oldest surviving alumni and was honored recently on campus where Fort Valley Mayor Barbara Williams gave her a key to the city. \u201cIt\u2019s great to give those folks their flowers while they live,\u2019\u2019 Williams said. Barfield Black still hasn\u2019t gotten over the surprise celebration. \u201cI just like to have died,\u2019\u2019 she said. Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY\n\nOther records showed that Edward had filled out a WWI draft registration card in 1917-1918.\n\nWe cheered \u2013 as quietly as we could \u2013 when we found the maiden name of great-grandmother Lucy\u2019s mother, Martha Marrick.\n\nThere were moments when we just sighed. For some records from 1863-64, just after the Emancipation Proclamation, \u201cMissing\u201d flashed across the screen.\n\nIn an earlier search of the 1880 Census, I found Lucinda Hardy, who was born about 1790, listed in the household of my great-great grandfather. It's not clear if she was his mother or grandmother. I assumed she had once been enslaved. I stared at the screen and almost cried. What would her life had been like?\n\nThe next day, at the Prince George County Courthouse, a clerk guided us into a room with huge ledgers.\n\nFor hours, we squinted in the fluorescent glare at the fancy cursive writing.\n\nSlaves had a harrowing journey to America. We tell it in augmented reality. Explore\n\nIn one transaction on Oct. 26, 1914, Edward and Lucy sold \u201cone (1) acre, more or less\u2019\u2019 for $75.\n\nThe year before they sold a parcel to the Norfolk & Western Railway Co. for $200 \u201ccash in hand.\u201d\n\nMy sister and I marveled at how, with little education, they were wheeling and dealing.\n\nWe weren't done.\n\nCousin Selidia said the Tucker family had once worshiped at the Lebanon Baptist Church, and great-grandfather Edward may have been a preacher there.\n\nSo Selina and I headed for Disputanta, a rural community south of Richmond. We drove long winding stretches before we spotted the red and white church marquee: \u201cLord keep our children safe.\u201d\n\nWe knocked. No answer. We searched the church cemetery for Tuckers. Nothing. I tucked a business card between the front doors.\n\nWe then went on a search for a miracle \u2013 a house with a porch near the railroad tracks with a big oak tree out front.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. But we had closed some gaps. Worn out, drained, we drove back to Washington, D.C.\n\nTurning to the elders\n\nInterviewing elders is key to capturing family history \u201cso it\u2019s not stuck in some attic somewhere,\u2019\u2019 Lisa Elzey, senior family history researcher at Ancestry, told me.\n\n\u201cEvery single person on your (family) tree has a story.\u201d\n\nFor many African Americans, oral history has been the strongest link to the past. The griot, or storyteller, has long been a part of African culture.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is, of course, to find the documentation to support it,\u2019\u2019 said Hollis Gentry, genealogy specialist at the National Museum of African American History and Culture\u2019s branch of the library. \u201cThat\u2019s a big challenge for not just African Americans only, but for everybody.\u2019\u2019\n\nTips to trace your family history beyond DNA tests Find resources\n\nToday, more African Americans are taking DNA tests, but experts agree chromosomes tell only part of the story.\n\n\u201cWhat really is important is to be able to look outside the box,\u201d said Elliott, of the African American history museum.\n\nRunaway slave ads can provide names and descriptions. Church records often list members of the congregation. Experts also point to ship manifests and wills of slave owners.\n\nThey encourage visits to local museums and universities, especially black colleges, which can house photosand other artifacts.\n\n\u201cYou have to be like 'CSI',\u2019\u2019 said Elliott. \u201cYou have to be this investigative person to really start putting together the pieces of the puzzle.\u201d\n\nPutting my DNA to the test\n\nI didn\u2019t know I'd have to fill a vial with my spit. The plastic tube for Ancestry was only a few inches long, but in my mind, it was like the 12-inch tube used for candy Pucker Powder.\n\nI waited until the afternoon traffic slowed to the bathroom at work and found a corner inside. Then to protect my life markers, I quickly shipped off the package.\n\nLater, I rolled six swabs across the inside of my cheeks, slid them into an envelope and shipped them to another lab for AfricanAncestry.com. The business of DNA testing has expanded over the years. I did two tests to be safe.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Deborah Barfield Berry, (left), with her late grandfather, William \"Herbert\" Montgomery, mother, Carrie Barfield, (center), and sister, Selina Barfield Brodie, (right).

Berry knew much more about her family history on her mother's side than her father's. Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY\n\nWeeks later, in that hotel room in Angola, I stared at my Ancestry results in an email.\n\nA colorful illustration showed where my DNA originated.\n\nBenin/Togo: 32%\n\nCameroon, Congo and Southern Bantu: 25%\n\nEngland, Wales and Northwestern Europe: 14%\n\nMali: 12%\n\nThe rest was a mix of Ivory Coast/Ghana, Ireland, Native American.\n\nSoon after I returned to Washington, I opened a package from AfricanAncestry.com, showing I shared maternal genetic ancestry with Tikar and Hausa people in Cameroon.\n\nMy results matched my DNA with samples from people in present-day African countries. Centuries ago, those regions were home to kingdoms rather than countries with borders. Cameroon and Angola are not far from each other.\n\nI\u2019d traveled 7,000 miles to chronicle Wanda\u2019s search for her roots, and the whole time, mine was somewhere in the same global neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt was like you were going to your ancestral home,\u2019\u2019 Elzey said.\n\n'A sense of pride'\n\nI\u2019m not the only one searching.\n\nGina Paige, president and co-founder of AfricanAncestry.com, said genetic testing there increased after the 2018 blockbuster \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d and the focus on the Year of Return initiative in Ghana.\n\nNearly 500 registered last week for the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society conference in Hyattsville, Maryland. Attendance has steadily increased. The group now has about 40 chapters.\n\nRic Murphy, the group\u2019s national vice president for history, attributes much of the recent interest to 1619 commemorations and the rise in DNA testing.\n\nAccess to more research and records has also spawned new narratives about the history and accomplishments of African Americans, he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re now beginning to find out that their ancestors really were a major part of our economy, a major part of our laws, our rules or regulations, our history,\u2019\u2019 Murphy said. \u201cIt is now giving folks a sense of pride and ownership.\u201d\n\nIt was enslaved ancestors who helped build the U.S. Capitol where I freely wander the halls interviewing lawmakers. They helped build the White House, steps away from the bureau where I worked on this story.\n\nMany non-Africans know from what European country their great-great-great-grandparents hail, even down to what boat they arrived on, said Simone Jones, director of data analytics for AfricanAncestry.com.\n\n\u201cWhere we get stuck, of course, is we weren\u2019t brought here by free will,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cWe were stolen, so that brings about a whole bunch of confusion.\u201d\n\nIt can be so painful, sometimes people don\u2019t want to think about it, she said.\n\n\u201cSometimes we have to dig and let people know it\u2019s OK.\u2019\u2019\n\n1619 Voices Reporter\u2019s assignment leads to powerful, unexpected family link Tracing one's family history can be intimidating and joy-filled.

He and Selidia are the only living grandchildren of Edward and Lucy. My father, William Barfield, their first grandchild, died in 2009.\n\nThe way Sonny tells it, his father \u2013 nicknamed Eddie \u2013 got fed up with farm life in Disputanta and his strict preacher father.\n\nDeborah Barfield Berry's cousin, Edward \"Sonny\" Tucker, took the AfricanAncestry.com test last month. Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY\n\nEddie made a life-changing decision one day when Edward Tucker tried to beat him because his younger brothers hadn\u2019t finished their chores. Eddie pulled a shotgun off the wall to ward off his father\u2019s wrath.\n\nHe then fled into the woods, where his sister later found him. Grandma Lucy sent her to give him the $2 she had earned selling yellow flowers on the side of the road.\n\nEddie jumped on a train headed north. He never returned.\n\nBy the 1930 Census, Eddie was living in an apartment in Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as a porter. His sister, Dorothy, had joined him.\n\nThe Tuckers were part of the migration of millions of African Americans who left a harsh life in the South, particularly after the Civil War and during the Jim Crow era, for enticing promises in the North.\n\nThe Tucker siblings also ended up in New York City. They owned beauty salons and corner grocery stores. They drove taxis. My grandmother cleaned houses, saving enough to buy a five-story brownstone.\n\nThe family gathered for Sunday dinners. They played cards, drank liquor and danced \u2013 all things my great-grandpa Tucker didn\u2019t allow.\n\n\u201cWe had a party every single weekend at somebody\u2019s house,\u2019\u2019 recalled Selidia. \u201cWe had a wonderful childhood.\u201d\n\nThey came in their finest gear, including Uncle Eddie, who had led the way to New York and opened a beauty shop in Harlem. Sonny said his father was one of the first African Americans to own a hair salon uptown.\n\n\u201cHe always had a nice car and would be as clean as he could be,\u2019\u2019 recalled Sonny, whose own shiny black Cadillac was parked nearby. \u201cAnd the sisters were bad, too. They looked like they were fashion models \u2026 You would never catch them raggedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might not have had a lot of education, but they had a heck of a lot of pride.\u201d\n\nMy great-grandmother, Lucy, eventually followed her children to New York. At one point, she lived with my grandmother. In her back room on the second floor, she smoked peach tobacco in a corncob pipe.\n\nEdward Tucker had stayed behind in Virginia. Now I had to go look for him.\n\nDid slavery start in 1619? Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nThe search for Edward Tucker\n\nThe rows of gray headstones seemed to fade into the woods. At the Evergreen Cemetery in Richmond, Kelly Pratt armed me with gloves and a mask so we could search for the headstone of Edward Tucker.\n\nThe headstones in this historic African American cemetery aren\u2019t all in neat sections or clearly marked plots. That massive undertaking is underway.\n\nI had searched for days for a death certificate, but my only lead was found online and I couldn\u2019t be sure he was the right one.\n\nMy visit to the state vital records agency and the state library had come up short.\n\nStumped, I searched the online obits in the Progress-Index, a local paper started in 1865.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Edward \"Sonny\" Tucker is pictured here as a youngster with his father, Edward Tucker, in Harlem.

His father, Edward Tucker, fled the harsh farm life in rural Disputanta, Virginia, in the early 1900s and headed north to New York. His siblings soon followed. Many settled in Brooklyn. Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY\n\nThe next day, I called Ms. Alice in the obit department. She referred me to the public library, where old editions were on microfiche. I would have to search the \u2018\u2018colored dots\u2019\u2019 section of the paper, the space set aside then for African American news.\n\nBut without the date of Edward Tucker\u2019s death, that would mean looking through every issue. It felt like I had slammed into a brick wall.\n\nThe one death certificate I had found earlier online offered a thread of hope.\n\nThis Edward Tucker was senile when he died. Like my great-grandfather, he was a preacher. He was also born around 1878. He was buried at Evergreen for $25.\n\nThe 60-acre cemetery is the resting place for thousands of African Americans, including leaders and activists such as Maggie Lena Walker, the first African American woman to start a bank.\n\nThe graveyard is dotted with yucca plants. The tough, rubbery plants aren\u2019t native to the area. The old folks believe they keep spirits at rest.\n\nOver in the historic section, seashells browned with age rest near headstones dating to the 1800s. A new seashell lay near one headstone.\n\nLegend has it that seashells were the last things Africans saw before being taken from their homeland. Some believe placing a shell by a headstone is part of the journey back home.\n\nFor hours, Kelly and I swiped cobwebs, skirted poison ivy and watched for snakes. We brushed leavesfrom headstones to read the names of fathers, mothers, civil rights leaders, veterans, teachers.\n\nNo Edward Thomas Tucker.\n\nI pulled off the gloves, but I wasn't discouraged.\n\nNearly two months after launching the search for the Tucker side of my family, I've learned the names of my great-great-grandparents. I understand how my family ended up in New York. I know where my ancestors came from in Africa. I visited the town of my grandmother\u2019s people. I reconnected with elders in my family.\n\nCousin Selidia wants a family gathering.\n\n\u201cThis is the time,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cfor coming home.\u201d\n\nGoing to church\n\nOne recent Sunday morning, I returned to Lebanon Baptist Church intent on finding out whether my great-grandfather Edward preached here.\n\nI patted my leg as the choir sang, \u201cFix it Jesus.\u2019\u2019\n\nMost of the church was standing, clapping and swaying.\n\nHands shot up when the singer demanded, \u201cRaise your hand if you need fixin\u2019.\u201d\n\nContinue the conversation Sign up here Get email updates about more stories like this\n\nWithservice over, James McDaniel, a deacon emeritus, greeted me, an unfamiliar face in the rear of the church. He shook his head when I asked whether Tuckers had worshipped there. He\u2019s been a member since he was 6. He\u2019s 75. He asked others, including his older sister Bernice, as they collected their purses and Bibles. They named Tuckers at other churches.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re scattered some of everywhere,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThere are eight black churches in Disputanta. My great-grandfather likely belonged to one of them.\n\nI followed Ms. Bernice to check another church. No luck there either. In the parking lot, Ms. Bernice promised to help in my search.

Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nThe long wait\n\nWe waited for weeks for DNA results from AfricanAncestry.com that would tell whether my Tucker family was related to Wanda\u2019s.\n\nThe testing required a male from each Tucker line. My cousin Sonny and Wanda\u2019s brother, Vincent, agreed to take the test.\n\nWanda\u2019s family \u2013 Brenda, Carolita, Walter, Foley, Floyd \u2013 all believe they\u2019re descendants of the first Africans brought to the English colonies. That claim has inspired celebration, research, remembrance and skepticism.\n\nTheir belief is rooted in the faith of oral history, their family\u2019s long ties to Hampton and no reason to doubt.\n\nUntil now, I hadn\u2019t even thought about my family\u2019s possible connection. So I was caught off guard when Murphy, the genealogist, said with my family name and my family\u2019s history in the region, \u201cThere\u2019s almost no way that you couldn\u2019t have some of that original blood in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you do your DNA?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have Bantu in you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you go,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe wait is over\n\nThe call with the DNA results finally came last week while I waited for a session at the black genealogy conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a match,\u2019\u2019 Jones, the analyst, told me.\n\n\"They\u2019re related.\u201d\n\nWanda Tucker, center, with Deborah Barfield Berry in Luanda, Angola. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nI didn't react. I had to be sure Jones understood what I was asking and that I understood exactly what she was saying. I didn\u2019t get all the scientific terms. I repeated the question, read back her response.\n\nSomewhere along the line, she said, Edward and Vincent share a male relative. We might never know where that connection happened, though because the results cover 500 to 2,000 years\n\n\u201cIt shows just how connected we are,\u201d Jones said.\n\nJones, who shares DNA information every day, was calm.
