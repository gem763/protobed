It directed each of the NCAA\u2019s three divisions to update their bylaws no later than January 2021.\n\n\u201cThe board\u2019s action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student-athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement on the website ncaa.org.\n\nThe Indianapolis-based NCAA reported total revenues of more than $1 billion last year, about 80% of which came from television and marketing rights fees.\n\nCalifornia last month became the first U.S. state to give college athletes the potentially lucrative opportunity to earn endorsement money, with Governor Gavin Newsom signing legislation into law that would take effect in 2023. Sponsors said it could encourage star athletes to stay in school rather than dropping out to turn professional.\n\nNew Jersey quickly moved to follow suit, with lawmakers last week introducing the \u201cNew Jersey Fair Play Act,\u201d to allow student athletes compensation for use of their names or likenesses and also the ability to hire their own agent or lawyer.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nSimilar bills were under consideration in Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Minnesota and in Congress, according to media reports.\n\nThe NCAA said \u201cmodernization\u201d of its guidelines should \u201creaffirm that student-athletes are students first and not employees of the university.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA board voted after hearing the recommendations from a working group that gathered input from student-athletes, coaches, college presidents, faculty and commissioners from the three divisions, the NCAA said.", "description": "U.S. college athletes can profit from brand sponsorships and endorsement deals under a new rule approved on Tuesday by the governing board of the NCAA, the organization that regulates U.S. collegiate sports.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446328837&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1RX", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
