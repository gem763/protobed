Despite Trump's promise to release the \"fully declassified and unredacted transcript,\" the memorandum notes that it is \"not a verbatim transcript\" of the discussion.\n\nThe call lasted about 30 minutes, according to the memorandum.\n\nThe conversation with Zelensky is reportedly a central part of the whistleblower complaint that spurred many Democrats to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump. Democrats are demanding that the Justice Department release the full whistleblower complaint and allow the whistleblower to testify to congressional committees.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had been reluctant to take impeachment steps, announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump on Tuesday. \"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of integrity of our elections,\" Pelosi said.", "description": "The call with Zelensky is reportedly a central part of the whistleblower complaint that prompted Nancy Pelosi to support an impeachment inquiry against Trump.", "authors": ["Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106148116-1569415967170gettyimages-1170772232.jpeg?v=1569415984", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
