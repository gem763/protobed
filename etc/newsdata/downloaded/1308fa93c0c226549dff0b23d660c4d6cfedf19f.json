He also announced a working group to address their concerns.\n\nSeparately, the army imposed a curfew late on Saturday in parts of Santiago. Pinera had earlier announced a state of emergency in the capital as clashes with police continued and spread to other Chilean cities.\n\nAs ordained by Chile\u2019s dictatorship-era constitution, the state of emergency will apply to Santiago and can last for 15 days. It grants the government additional powers to restrict citizens\u2019 freedom of movement and their right to assembly. It saw soldiers return to the streets for the first time since an earthquake devastated parts of the country in 2010.\n\nChile students' mass fare-dodging expands into city-wide protest Read more\n\n\u201cThe aim is to ensure public order and the safety of public and private property,\u201d Pi\u00f1era said in a televised address. \u201cThere will be no room for violence in a country with the rule of law at its core.\u201d\n\nThe latest protests follow grievances over the cost of living, specifically of healthcare, education and public services. Anger has also been directed at the Carabineros national police force, whose heavy-handed repression of protests has come under the spotlight. Once one of the country\u2019s most respected institutions, its reputation has been eroded by corruption scandals and a reputation for brutality.\n\n", "description": "Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era suspends public transport price hikes that sparked widespread protests", "authors": ["Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1a6d7a6847dbe0b6cb8d51c209121cd733c339/0_25_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c1e286a190fa3c3638ea6bb94aa16d6", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
