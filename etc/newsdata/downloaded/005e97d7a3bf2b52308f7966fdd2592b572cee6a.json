and those first words can shape the way they are assessed in their competence and fitness for a job.\n\nThe findings demonstrate that people can accurately assess a stranger's socio-economic position, defined by their income, education, and occupation status, based on brief speech patterns.\n\nHiring managers are influenced by these snap perceptions in ways that favor job applicants from higher social classes.\n\nAnd that suggests better measures to make sure recruitment really is equal opportunity may need to be put in place.\n\nIn a new study, hiring managers judged job candidates' socio-economic statuses within seconds of meeting them, based not on what they said but how they spoke - and favored those who sounded 'higher class' regardless of qualifications\n\nDr Michael Kraus, Assistant Professor at Yale School of Management in the US, said: 'Our study shows that even during the briefest interactions, a person's speech patterns shape the way people perceive them, including assessing their competence and fitness for a job.\n\n'While most hiring managers would deny that a job candidate's social class matters, in reality, the socio-economic position of an applicant or their parents is being assessed within the first seconds they speak - a circumstance that limits economic mobility and perpetuates inequality.'\n\nThe researchers based their findings on five separate studies.\n\nThe first four examined the extent that people accurately perceive social class based on a few seconds of speech.\n\nResearchers found that reciting seven random words is sufficient to allow people to discern the speaker's social class with above-chance accuracy.\n\nThey discovered that speech adhering to subjective standards for English as well as digital standards such as the voices used in tech products like the Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant is associated with both actual and perceived higher social class.\n\nThe researchers also showed that pronunciation cues in an individual's speech communicate their social status more accurately than the content of their speech.\n\nThe fifth study examined how these speech cues influence hiring, based on 20 prospective job candidates from varied socioeconomic backgrounds who were recruited to interview for an entry-level lab manager position at Yale.\n\nPrior to sitting for a formal job interview, the candidates each recorded a conversation in which they were asked to briefly describe themselves.\n\nA sample of 274 individuals with hiring experience either listened to the audio or read transcripts of the recordings.\n\nThe hiring managers were asked to assess the candidates' professional qualities, starting salary, signing bonus, and perceived social class based solely on the brief pre-interview discussion without reviewing the applicants' job interview responses or resumes.\n\nFindings suggest the hiring managers who listened to the audio recordings were more likely to accurately assess socioeconomic status than those who read transcripts.\n\nDevoid of any information about the candidates' actual qualifications, the hiring managers judged the candidates from higher social classes as more likely to be competent for the job, and a better fit for it than the applicants from lower social classes.\n\nThey also assigned the applicants from higher social classes more lucrative salaries and signing bonuses than the candidates with lower social status.\n\nDr Kraus added: 'We rarely talk explicitly about social class, and yet, people with hiring experience infer competence and fitness based on socio-economic position estimated from a few seconds of an applicant's speech.\n\n'If we want to move to a more equitable society, then we must contend with these ingrained psychological processes that drive our early impressions of others.\n\n'Despite what these hiring tendencies may suggest, talent is not found solely among those born to rich or well-educated families.\n\n'Policies that actively recruit candidates from all levels of status in society are best positioned to match opportunities to the people best suited for them.'\n\nThe findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "description": "After hearing recordings of job candidates speaking about unrelated topics, Yale University study judges accurately guessed their socio-economic statuses, favoring 'higher class' candidates.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/21/20005904-0-image-a-3_1571691126067.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
