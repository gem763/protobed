So when her now-husband proposed, she leaped at the chance to plan every detail of her wedding.\n\nThe day came and went perfectly. But afterwards she felt sad and restless. She realized she had been building up to the wedding too much in her mind, and now was suffering from post-wedding slump.\n\nTo combat post-wedding slump, she advises working on long-term goals other than wedding planning before the big day, and trying out something new after.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWhen Seth proposed on a snowy morning in the United States National Arboretum, the high never really stopped. There was the excitement of starting our married life together, of course. But there was also the wedding planning, which in the eyes of someone who loves to plan life in general: gold.\n\nFinally! A day I could obsess over, plan down to the minute, and analyze from every angle without anyone telling me to chill out.\n\nBecause over-planning for this one day of your life is totally normal.\n\nEven if you're on the verge of becoming a total bridezilla, you'll still get a free pass. My fiance \u2014 wonderful, laid-back, calm-to-my-crazy man that he is \u2014 left most of this planning to me. This migrating obsession from color palette to theme to flowers to bridesmaid dresses to makeup to entrees (and on and on and on) kept me busy for months.\n\nWhen our day finally came, it ended up being an absolutely perfect one. If anything went wrong, we were blissfully unaware of it. We danced and drank and laughed and cried our way through the weekend and then \u2026\n\nThen it was Monday.\n\nMary Grace McCormick. Courtesy of Mary Grace McCormick\n\nI woke up that morning and knew I was happy, that I'd made the right choice.\n\nBut I couldn't shake this other feeling. One that I couldn't quite pinpoint.\n\nThere were moments when I felt sadness; at other points, it was restlessness.\n\nAnd then it hit me: I had built our wedding up in my mind too much. I had put it on a pedestal. No other event or thing could even come close to making me feel that happy again. At least that's what I had been telling myself without even realizing it.\n\nIt's no wonder I felt depressed, let down, at a loss. In a slump.\n\nNo one wants to feel this way when their happily ever after is just beginning. So here are the habits you can implement \u2014 three pre-wedding and one post-wedding \u2014 so that rather than a slump post-wedding, you'll have the best honeymoon high.", "description": "When you're planning a wedding, that day can reign supreme in your mind.
