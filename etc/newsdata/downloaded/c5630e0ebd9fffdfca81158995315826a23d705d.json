Wednesday: 12 hours for amendments from 1pm culminating in a 1am vote on a second referendum.\n\n12 hours for amendments from 1pm culminating in a 1am vote on a second referendum. Thursday: 8 hours for the final stages and final vote finishing at around 7.30pm.\n\nThe first key hurdle vote is expected to pass, probably, but that's where things get difficult - because the first vote is only on the principle of the Bill. The devil's in the detail.\n\nAfter (well, if) the first vote is passed on Tuesday, Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg will introduce the 'programme motion' - the government's proposed order of business for week. It could spell out late night and weekend sittings in a bid to get the WAB passed.\n\nThis is a risky moment - as MPs can vote to take control of the agenda, denying the government the opportunity to bring the WAB to its next stage.\n\nEven if they manage to keep control of the agenda in the Commons MPs will then propose amendments to the WAB by 7pm Tuesday. More of this below.\n\nIf the government wants to avoid a delay it must ensure that the WAB is passed by the end of the week - and without amendments that change its purpose completely.\n\nAny later and the delay becomes more likely as the European Parliament has indicated it will not have the time to scrutinise the deal ahead of Halloween.\n\nWill the Brexit deal get through Parliament?\n\n(Image: Kiran Ridley)\n\nThe first big vote on Tuesday (the 'second reading') will be on a knife edge.\n\nDowning Street believes it has the numbers, with many of 21 ousted Tories - plus 6 to 10 Labour backbenchers - in favour even though Labour and the DUP are against.\n\nFormer Tory cabinet minister Amber Rudd has indicated she would support Mr Johnson's deal and thought there was a \"coalition for getting the Prime Minister's deal through\".\n\nMeanwhile Labour MP Caroline Flint has already said she will back the deal - and she may carry some of the Labour \u2018MPs for a Deal\u2019 with her.\n\nBut there's a massive spanner in the works to come.\n\nAs part of the process MPs have the opportunity to debate possible amendments.\n\nThese are likely to be on whether to add a customs union, a second referendum and to extend transitional arrangements with the EU to prevent the UK crashing out in 2020.\n\nThis could radically change the shape of the deal that was negotiated with the EU - possibly prompting No10 to pull the deal altogether, plunging Britain into limbo or no-deal and pushing for an election.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg insisted: \"The Bill of course won\u2019t be pulled.\" But government briefings suggested otherwise.\n\nMPs like Lisa Nandy have said they would not back the whole deal as it stands, but seek to amend it. Various groups in parliament are hurriedly planning to put forward amendments which could complicate things.\n\nWill Brexit still happen on October 31?\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nIt is possible.\n\nMr Johnson might still get his deal through Parliament in time for the deadline, wiping out the need for delay.\n\nAnd secondly, a final decision on whether to delay Brexit hasn't been made yet - it's in 27 EU leaders' hands.\n\nThe Prime Minister and his ally Michael Gove have insisted they can still get Brexit through by October 31, and even claim no-deal is still possible.\n\nMr Gove chaired a meeting of the no-deal planning committee on Sunday and \"triggered\" emergency plan Operation Yellowhammer, moving hundreds of civil servants off their day jobs into full-time operation centres.\n\nIf MPs agree the deal before the end of the week then it possible that the European Parliament can complete its votes in time for Halloween.\n\nBut every day makes it less likely that deal will be approved in Westminster, and Brussels before the end of the month.\n\nWill EU leaders delay Brexit?\n\nThey will almost certainly grant an extension - despite making noises to the contrary.\n\nBut they could turn down the three-month suggested period to suggest a different one instead.\n\nToday the European Parliament shelved their own vote on the deal because they want to wait for the UK parliament to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nThey want an extension - but the EU is very keen not to be held responsible for any delay so would seek an extra EU Parliament session to vote on the deal next week.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron went furthest. \"I am not trying to read into the future but I do not think we shall grant any further delay,\u201d he said last week\n\nThey are certainly annoyed to have their own plans disrupted yet again, but very few people seriously expect the EU to say no if a request comes in.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those who has indicated as much.\n\nThe big question is how long an extension would be. Would they grant just two weeks of \"technical\" extension to allow the withdrawal bill legislation to pass through Parliament?\n\nOr would they insist on a longer one - until the end of January as set out in the Benn Act perhaps - to give the UK time to resolve this once and for all.\n\nWill Boris Johnson be forced to accept an extension?\n\nYes - if MPs do not vote it down in Parliament.\n\nThat is, at least, according to the terms of the Benn Act which the PM could try to subvert or somehow get around.\n\nRemind me, what happened on Saturday again?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nBoris Johnson put forward a motion to give a green or red light to his Brexit deal.\n\nBut MPs voted to amend his motion, to withhold approval for the Brexit deal \"unless and until\" every part of it has been passed into UK law. The amended motion passed without a formal vote because Boris Johnson refused to take part.\n\nTory ministers claimed that rendered the vote on Saturday meaningless. This is simply untrue. MPs stated their view - and refused to back the PM's deal as it is now.\n\nWhat is Erskine May and how is it relevant?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nParliament's enormous, baffling rule book - which John Bercow is meant to follow.\n\nIt says on page 397: \u201cA motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session.\u201d\n\nEffectively that means Boris Johnson couldn't hold two votes in the same year on the same issue unless the circumstances changed.\n\nSpeaker Bercow said the government had offered no \"explanation\" of how the circumstances had changed since Saturday.\n\nEven if the difference was asking for a delay, \"this is not persuasive\", the Speaker said. He added: \"Today\u2019s motion is in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s motion and the House has decided the matter\u201d.\n\nHow significant or shocking is Speaker Bercow's ruling?\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNot very significant and not very shocking - despite what Brexiteers might claim.\n\nFirst of all, Speaker Bercow was widely expected to make today's ruling because the PM's behaviour was seen by many as being outside the rules.\n\nSecondly, it doesn't actually make any meaningful difference to whether Brexit will pass - more of this below.\n\nDespite this, Brexiteers voiced fury at the Speaker - who they believe is biased - as Tory Bernard Jenkin sniped: \"It\u2019s remarkable how often you please one lot and not the other lot\u201d.\n\nAnd David T C Davies fumed: \u201c[Your rulings] always seem to favour one side of the argument and never the government.\"\n\nCritics suggested Boris Johnson - who shamefully dodged the Commons session altogether - only tried for today's vote in the first place so he could cynically accuse Parliament of thwarting Brexit.\n\nWhat does all this mean for an election?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIf MPs spend the next two weeks legislating on Brexit, a general election cannot be held before Christmas.\n\nLabour is unlikely to trigger a confidence vote, which could collapse Boris Johnson's administration, while the legislative process is ongoing.\n\nAnd because of the five-weeks legally needed between the calling of a snap ballot and a poll being held, taking up parliamentary time until Halloween mean the earliest ballot would be held is in January.\n\nThat is because Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill has reportedly warned an election should not take place after December 12 in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nBut early January will not see an election either because no-one wants the festive season to be overshadowed by electoral campaigning.\n\nSo the next likely date would be mid-February.", "description": "Boris Johnson's Brexit deal is still kicking - and there'll now be a marathon Commons race to pass it.
