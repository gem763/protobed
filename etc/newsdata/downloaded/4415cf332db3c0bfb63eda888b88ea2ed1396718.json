(Photo: Thomas Shea, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\"That guy is unbelievable,\" said third baseman Alex Bregman. \"He's just like Justin (Verlander), they both prepare so well.\"\n\nGibson holds the postseason record with 17 in Game 1 of the 1968 World Series. Cole tied Koufax and three others for the third-most strikeouts.\n\nMore: Didi Gregorius hits grand slam, Yankees rout Twins to take 2-0 ALDS lead\n\nMore: Minnesota Twins postseason misery continues: Record losing streak reaches 15 games\n\nThe 15 K's also set an franchise postseason record and ALDS record.\n\nAnd to join even more elite company, Cole has two career postseason games where he has struck out at least 12. Only three other pitchers in baseball history have done that, and no one has done it more. Tom Seaver, Jim Palmer, and Gibson each did it twice.\n\nCole exited the game after 7\u2154 innings leading 3-0. He threw a season-high 118 pitches, 83 for strikes, walked one with no earned runs.\n\nAnd, what may be the most impressive statistic of the night -- Cole had 33 swings-and-misses, the most since 2008 when the stat was tracked.\n\nThe only pitchers in postseason history with more strikeouts than Gerrit Cole are Bob Gibson and Kevin Brown \u2014 Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) October 6, 2019\n\n.@GerritCole45's 15 Ks in a single game are a #postseason record for the @astros.\n\n\n\nOnly Bob Gibson (17) and Kevin Brown (16) have ever had more in a postseason game. pic.twitter.com/dhSttJpnko \u2014 MLB Stats (@MLBStats) October 6, 2019\n\n***", "description": "Astros pitcher Gerrit Cole set a franchise postseason and ALDS record with 15 strikeouts while going 7 2/3 innings in Game 2 against the Rays.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published A.M.
