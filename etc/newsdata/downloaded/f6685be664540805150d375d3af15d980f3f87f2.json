A senior U.S. defense official clarified that the situation was still fluid and plans could change.\n\nAny decision to send additional U.S. troops to Iraq is likely to be heavily scrutinized in a country where Iran has been steadily amassing influence.\n\n\"That is the current game plan, things can change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal but that is the game plan right now,\" the senior official added.\n\nIt is unclear whether the U.S. troops will use Iraq as a base to launch ground raids into Syria and carry out airstrikes against Islamic State militants.\n\nThe additional U.S. troops would add to the more than 5,000 American troops already based in the country, training Iraqi forces and helping to ensure that Islamic State militants do not resurge.\n\nWhile Esper said he had spoken with his Iraqi counterpart and will continue to have conversations in the future, the move will likely be viewed with skepticism by some in Iraq.\n\nIraq is in the midst of a political crisis, as mass protests have led to more than 100 deaths and 6,000 injuries during the week starting Oct. 1.\n\nIran's role in responding to the demonstrations has been another reminder of Tehran\u2019s reach in Iraq, where a sizable number of former militia commanders are now members of parliament and support the Iranian agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nSYRIA CEASEFIRE \"GENERALLY\" HOLDING\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that Turkey would press on with its offensive into northeastern Syria and \"crush the heads of terrorists\" if a deal with Washington on the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the area was not fully implemented.\n\nOn Saturday the fragile truce was holding along the border, with a few Turkish military vehicles crossing the border, Reuters journalists at the scene said. In the last 36 hours, there have been 14 \"provocative attacks\" from Syria, Turkey's defense ministry said.\n\nEsper said that the ceasefire in northeastern Syria was generally holding.\n\n\"I think overall the ceasefire generally seems to be holding, we see a stabilization of the lines, if you will, on the ground, and we do get reports of intermittent fires, this and that, that doesn't surprise me necessarily,\" he added.\n\nThere has been concern that the Turkish incursion into northeastern Syria would allow Islamic State militants to make gains and see militants escaping prisons guarded by Kurdish fighters.\n\nEsper said that the United States was still in contact with the Kurdish fighters, known as the YPG, and they appeared to continue to defend the prisons in areas they still controlled.
