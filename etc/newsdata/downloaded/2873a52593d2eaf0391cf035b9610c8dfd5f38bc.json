This, unfortunately for the UK, is not a foregone conclusion and owes its roots in many ways in the great Irish famine.\n\nThe great famine or great hunger was a period of mass starvation, death and emigration between 1845 to 1849. There was a failure of the potato crop and the cause was laid squarely at the feet of our English masters at the time.\n\nThe population then was 8 million and even now, 170 years later, it still hasn't recovered.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nA million-plus people died and over a million emigrated in those coffin ships to a new life in America and thus began our special relationship with the USA. Like the roots of a growing sapling tree, the emigrants spread to every part and into every facet of America and its society.\n\nA trade deal is not the personal gift of an American president, but of the Congress and the existence of the powerful bipartisan Irish bloc (many of whom can trace their ancestory back to the famine) have stated that a US-UK trade deal will not happen if the Good Friday Agreement is put in jeopardy.\n\nThe ghosts of the great hunger and the humble potato may still have a lage part to play in the Brexit end game\n\nDr Aidan Hampson\n\nDublin\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This apparently includes collusion with a foreign government that has become notorious for inciting fear and hatred of migrants, for corruption, and for using antisemitism against its opponents.\n\nThere are no depths to which Johnson and Dominic Cummings will not sink.\n\nAs it would appear that an extension would be vetoed, it is surely time for Article 50 to be revoked prior to 31 October, after which plans can be made for either another referendum, a general election, or both.\n\nMay I say that I originally voted to Leave but have most definitely 100 per cent changed my mind, along with thousands of others. I am planning to travel to London on the 19 October to join the protest.\n\nJudith Sweet\n\nLostwithiel\n\nBrexit stress\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Boris Johnson has made spending on the NHS a priority.

I did laugh, full marks to the writers!\n\nRobert Boston\n\nKingshill\n\nThe Bible and hate speech\n\nJ Longstaff (Letters, 5 October) asks \u201chow much more of the Bible ... is not respected by our ... judges\u201d. I suspect that our courts would not endorse Leviticus 20:13: \u201cIf a man lieth with a man as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.\u201d\n\nIndeed, I have wondered why hotels and cruise ships which persist in leaving Gideon bibles including this text in their customers\u2019 rooms have never been prosecuted for a hate crime.\n\nMichael Clarke\n\nPortishead", "description": "Boris Johnson views the great trade deal he want to do with Trump's America as his trump card (excuse the pun) in his Brexit dealings.
