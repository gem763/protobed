I was afraid that the game would be cancelled,\u201d said Cai Zhicong, 27, an avowed James fanatic.\n\n\u201cI have been imagining what kind of a person he is. I\u2019m so excited.\u201d\n\nThe NBA holds a pair of pre-season games annually to stoke its already red-hot popularity in China, where it is arguably the single most popular and followed sports league.\n\nThat following could take a hit after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey angered China with his comments and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver added more fuel by defending Morey\u2019s right to free speech.\n\nHong Kong is a semi-autonomous Chinese territory and the ruling Communist Party considers democracy protesters there to be violent separatists.\n\n\u2013 Mixed feelings \u2013\n\nBut China sports experts believe the NBA is well-placed to weather the brand crisis.\n\nThe quality of play in China\u2019s domestic league is far below the NBA, and its national team gives the country little to cheer about.\n\nThe mixed feelings of many fans were clear in their appearance, with thousands wearing NBA jerseys but also stickers of China\u2019s flag on their cheeks.\n\nA fan in a Lakers jersey who gave only his surname Yang, said Chinese can be both patriotic citizens and NBA fans.\n\n\u201cFrom a national standpoint, we should support our country\u2019s decisions. Even if the game was cancelled, we wouldn\u2019t have any regrets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t cancelled\u2026 (and) because James is my idol, I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201d\n\nThe dispute is likely to keep simmering.\n\nOutside the game venue, a pair of protesters held up red banners bearing profane curses of Morey and Silver.\n\nPlans to air the game in China were ditched amid a general revolt by the NBA\u2019s Chinese sponsors and partners.\n\nBut game images seeped onto Chinese social media, with many Chinese web users denouncing the spectators as \u201cshameless.\u201d\n\nA number of people stood outside the arena to hand small Chinese flags to arriving fans, while others said they came to the area to declare support for their country.\n\n\u201cI (am here) to support China,\u201d said one man who also wore a t-shirt saying \u201cI love Hong Kong\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe (Morey) has got to go. He has to apologise to the Chinese people. He has hurt the Chinese people\u2019s feelings,\u201d railed the man, who declined to give his name.\n\nThere were no incidents reported outside the stadium.\n\nInside the arena, the mood was far different, as fans lapped up the NBA\u2019s signature show-biz onslaught of skillful play interspersed with thumping music, cheerleader routines and slam-dunking acrobats during breaks.\n\nMost fans seemed too dazzled to bother waving the little red flags.\n\nAfter an AFP reporter pointed out to one young woman that her flag had fallen to the floor \u2014 a no-no in China \u2014 she sheepishly picked it up, stowed it in her bag and turned back to the game.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 For two raucous hours on Thursday night, Chinese fans and US basketball stars called a timeout on the increasingly bitter clash of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/68a8a8_chinese-fans-watching-lebron-james-los-angeles-lakers-in-shanghai-hail-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
