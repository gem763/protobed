Our diamonds give you something positive to look forward to.\"\n\nAccording to Archer and Ozar, customers receive a \"welcome kit,\" which includes a small container for a half-cup of ashes or hair. Customers then send that back to Eterneva. Customers also pick the diamond of their liking.\n\nThen \"we extract carbon from a half a cup of ashes or hair,\" Ozar said during the episode. \"Once we have carbon, we then use high pressure, high temperature to grow a diamond.\"\n\nThe prices of these diamonds range from $3,000 to $20,000, according to Archer. She said the average order value is $8,000, and customers \"pay upfront, in full.\"\n\n\"That's smart,\" Cuban said.\n\nIt takes 10 months to make the diamond, and it costs Eterneva between $3,000 to $5,000 to make.", "description": "Billionaire Mark Cuban was sold on Eterneva's diamond business, but not every Shark was happy that the company made it onto \"Shark Tank.\"", "authors": ["Taylor Locke"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104121665-GettyImages-612459410.jpg?v=1571071004", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
