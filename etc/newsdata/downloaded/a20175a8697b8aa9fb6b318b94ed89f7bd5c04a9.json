Celebrity Big Brother? Why are you so thrilled? It\u2019s not good for America!\u201d\n\nShe went on to insist Bolton had a \u201cgood reputation\u201d before he joined the White House, but now his time with the Trump administration has left him \u201cterribly tainted.\u201d At the same time, she applauded Bolton for potentially being the one who stopped the Camp David meeting.\n\n\u201cMaybe you stopped the Taliban from coming to Camp David, and if this is why you\u2019re out, thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want the Taliban in Camp David, but the whole thing was bizarre for me.\u201d\n\nThis prompted co-host Whoopi Goldberg to jump in and question whether the Taliban invitation ever existed in the first place.\n\n\u201cDo you actually think he had set up a meeting with the Taliban to come to the United States?\u201d Goldberg asked the panel to which co-host Sunny Hostin noted that he previously invited North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nMcCain, meanwhile, attempted to rally her colleagues to fight the federal government if the Taliban set foot in the symbolic presidential retreat.\n\n\u201cIf that ended up happening,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI would create a coup starting with this table, and I would say, \u2018Ladies, we\u2019re going to Camp David and stopping this from happening because of all the bat-crap crazy things, that\u2019s the dumbest!\u2019\u201d\n\nGoldberg, however, continued to push her theory that Trump made up the whole meeting in order to distract the public.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe for one second\u2014it doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d she stated, adding that Trump \u201cput it out there\u201d because he has \u201cmore people looking at other stuff and not what he\u2019s actually doing.\u201d\n\nOutside of Trump himself claiming that the meeting was scheduled, the Taliban responded to the cancellation of the peace talks by saying \u201cthis has damaged the U.S. the most.\u201d Furthermore, reporting from The Daily Beast and others revealed that the president had set up the meeting as a way to boast about his own \u201cCamp David Accords.\u201d", "description": "Whoopi Goldberg, meanwhile, insisted that Trump made up the Camp David meeting in order to distract the public.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568219657/view_58_kqe5oi", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
