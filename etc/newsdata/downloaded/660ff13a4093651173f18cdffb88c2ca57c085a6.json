It's the worst opening weekend of the year so far for a movie premiering in over 2,500 theaters and the sixth-worst opening of all time for a movie opening in that many theaters.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Joker' is projected to break multiple box-office records when it hits theaters\n\nTo make matters worse, \"The Goldfinch\" cost $45 million to make (before marketing costs), so it will struggle to earn back its budget, especially with the international box office also lacking. The movie made a combined $985,000 in 12 international markets over the weekend, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nThe movie entered theaters with terrible reviews, which didn't help its chances. It has a 25% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. Indiewire called it a \"gauzy, bloated slab of Oscar bait.\" The Washington Post wrote that it's \"overstuffed, overlong, and utterly uninvolving.\"\n\n\"The Goldfinch\" is the latest dud for Warner Bros. in a lackluster year. It released two devastating flops in back-to-back weekends last month with \"The Kitchen\" and \"Blinded by the Light,\" and its tentpole $200 million summer release, \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters,\" disappointed.\n\nWhile \"It: Chapter Two\" is currently dominating the box office, the studio still needs another win. It will likely get it when \"Joker\" premieres next month.", "description": "Warner Bros.' adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \"The Goldfinch,\" crashed and burned in over 2,500 theaters over the weekend.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f88c82e22af0334799334-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
