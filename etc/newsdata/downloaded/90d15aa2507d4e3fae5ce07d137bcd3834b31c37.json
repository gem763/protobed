A significant amount of new online content should continue to improve the company's cash flow and a strong pipeline of new releases adds to the appeal. The recent strong Borderlands 3 launch resulted in that franchise hitting $US1 billion ($A1.46 billion) in net bookings.\n\nTake-Two Interactive's Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nThe company has some of the most successful gaming franchises in the video game market, spearheaded by the iconic Grand Theft Auto. For the PS4 platform, the company\u2019s Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto V and XCOM 2: War of the Chosen feature in the top five on review aggregation site Metacritic. That Grand Theft Auto V is six years old makes the feat even more impressive.\n\nBehind a recent increase in recurrent spending are a growing potential gamer base, more titles under the company\u2019s roof, more regular mid-cycle updates and persistent online offerings. Gamers are often sticking with a game longer because of the regular updates and the \"sticky\" engagement that occurs when they've sunk so much time into progressing in that game environment.\n\nManagement also noted at the time of the fiscal 2020 first-quarter results in August that the company had its \u201cstrongest development pipeline in its history.\u201d", "description": "Gamers are often sticking with titles such as Grand Theft Auto longer because of the regular updates and the 'sticky' engagement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/beca2c29b36ede97ff24fc735e7295df7bf2c9c7", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
