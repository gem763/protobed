Last season, with a huge injury list including players such as Jordan Nobbs, Kim Little and Danielle Carter, I think we did amazingly well at Arsenal. Wherever people had to play they did \u2013 we picked up the roles quite quickly.\n\nAs one of the players who was still fit, I weirdly didn\u2019t feel more pressure. I just really wanted to win the title. We were all desperate for that first title for Arsenal in seven years and everyone was on the same page. That was the focus. We knew that we didn\u2019t have many people and the whole experience brought us closer together.\n\nAs we battled across the finish line we were just very thankful for the great start we had together. We built up a lot of points in the first block of games and ultimately that won us the league.\n\nWomen\u2019s Super League 2019-20: 10 things to look out for this season Read more\n\nThat was the thing that we could fall back on. The team was still good, we weren\u2019t panicking, but every time someone gets injured you feel scared, especially when it\u2019s going well, because we were on fire towards the beginning of last season.\n\nIt was our versatility that saved us and took the pressure off. I played all over. I like to be in the middle because that\u2019s where I feel free and most natural; I am able to do whatever I want and really read the game. If I\u2019m on the wing Joe [Montemurro, the manager] always tells me I have that same freedom, but I struggle to feel like I do. I\u2019m almost scared that I\u2019m going to get in the way of, say, the No 10 wanting to run into the pocket. Joe\u2019s calmness also played a big part. When he came in he brought a lot of clarity. We\u2019ve got a very creative team and Joe\u2019s standards and our individual creativity are a great match.\n\nI don\u2019t think you can find a player who has one bad word to say about Joe. He\u2019s very chilled, his tactics are on point all the time and the analysis is great \u2013 he\u2019s basically always right. But it\u2019s his human side that makes him a good manager. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in needing to get trophies but he takes the pressure away from it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dani\u00eblle van de Donk with her manager at Arsenal, Joe Montemurro. \u2018He has brought a lot of clarity,\u2019 says the Dutch international.

When Katie McCabe\u2019s goal went in, in the 79th minute, it was the best feeling ever. We knew if we won we were back in the Champions League. We were all dying to get the club back into Europe but nothing was falling right in that game. No one was really hitting the ball at the goal. When Katie hit it I was just so grateful that we\u2019d finally taken a shot.\n\nTwo games later we were welcoming Manchester City to Borehamwood already knowing we were champions. I\u2019d never had that before so I felt amazing. We could, not in a bullying way, sort of say: \u2018Ha, it doesn\u2019t matter what you are going to do now.\u2019\n\nNow our team is stronger. The squad feels stronger. We\u2019ve lost to Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg and Barcelona in pre-season, and beaten Tottenham. But those losses don\u2019t mean we\u2019ve had a poor pre-season \u2013 we have learned a lot from those games.\n\nAs well as players coming back from injury we\u2019ve also had players coming back late from the World Cup. It has taken me a while to get over the World Cup final, and to rationalise it. It was almost a month before I could really think about how proud I was of the team, and myself. You don\u2019t play a final not to win. Everything goes into it: you put all your sweat and tears into it. It is fair enough to say that the USA were better than us and deserved to win, but it took a while to realise what an amazing achievement second place was for us.\n\nWomen's Football News (@WFRumour) This goal by Dani\u00eblle van de Donk deserves more views. What a gorgeous pass and what a great finish. pic.twitter.com/Uyf5ch08ps\n\nWe have to be realistic. It was our second World Cup and the Netherlands had not achieved much before we won the Euros in 2017. Now we\u2019ve shown that wasn\u2019t a one-time thing and ultimately it is a small step for the future. I hope we inspire a lot of young kids in the Netherlands to play football and to be even better than we are now so that it keeps us on this high level. It is now the biggest-growing sport in the Netherlands and I\u2019m proud of that but at the same time I hope the league is going to get a boost from it, because it is not strong enough, at the moment, to keep us at the top.\n\nThose of us at the World Cup have not had much of a rest but we also can\u2019t wait to be playing again. This season is going to be the best yet. We\u2019ve won the title, we\u2019ve got Champions League football and we are going to be even better than we were last year \u2013 and we were already pretty good to watch.\n\nRetaining the title is going to be very difficult but that\u2019s the thing I like about the league \u2013 it\u2019s always a challenge. We\u2019re at a stage now where everyone can take points off of everyone else. If the WSL isn\u2019t already the most attractive league in the world then I think it will be in the near future. Hopefully we win, and hopefully the fans keep singing my song. I love it. It is a strange but brilliant feeling \u2013 and it\u2019s got the best rhythm.", "description": "Adaptability was key for our injury-hit side last season, now we\u2019re fit, firing and ready for a Champions League challenge as well", "authors": ["Dani\u00eblle Van De Donk"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977fc5ab6d956f2304b5f59db61fe24770d33c0e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7dc1c6eaad0ee093f91eecd0a43059ed", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
