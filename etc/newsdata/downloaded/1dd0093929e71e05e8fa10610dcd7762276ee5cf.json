We all know he's not a goalscoring machine or that goal-scoring comes naturally to him.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"He's got other attributes to his game that are phenomenal that we see him produce for England on a regular basis.\n\n\"He gets all this criticism thrown at him yet you've got players like Martial who just goes missing. You talk injuries but it happens every single season at United.\n\n\"Why get rid of Lukaku when you've got someone like Martial who is doing that every week. Just because he's a younger player, or he's more valuable? I'm questioning so many decisions that are being made.\"\n\nMartial returned to training last week and could be in contention to face Liverpool on Sunday.\n\nPaul Pogba, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Luke Shaw has also boosted Solskjaer's ranks for the crunch clash with the table toppers.", "description": "Man Utd allowed Romelu Lukaku to join Inter Milan this summer, while Anthony Martial has spent most of this season injured", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653840.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-Uniteds-Belgian-striker-Rome.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
