You said all of these things before Trump took office. Which of them do not apply to him?\n\nSenator Sasse, you have offered yourself as a voice of conservative conscience, imploring people to make hard, principled choices over convenient, self-serving ones. You have written a book arguing that today\u2019s Americans need to grow up.\n\n\u201cThroughout our history, our wisest statesmen have warned that America\u2019s greatest risk has never been attack from abroad but rot from within,\u201d you wrote. \u201cThis exceptional nation cannot endure by mere inertia.\u201d Senator Sasse, do you believe that defending Trump is the principled thing to do?\n\nSenator Joni Ernst, as a student at Iowa State University in the late 1980s, you traveled to the Soviet Union \u2014 Ukraine, to be specific \u2014 on an agricultural exchange program.
