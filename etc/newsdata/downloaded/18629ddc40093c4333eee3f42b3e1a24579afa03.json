Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is backing a liberal challenger to fellow Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski \u2014 her first endorsement of a candidate aligned with the progressive Justice Democrats group since being elected to Congress.\n\nThe left-wing political action committee, which aims to primary more moderate Democrats, announced in a tweet Tuesday that Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will support Marie Newman\u2019s bid to oust Lipinski (D-Ill.) and represent Illinois' 3rd congressional district.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe are so proud that @Marie4Congress is the first Justice Democrat of this cycle to receive an endorsement from @AOC,\u201d the organization\u2019s official Twitter account wrote online. \u201cThe momentum is growing to make the Democratic Party fight for solutions as big as the problems we face and create a party for voters, not corporate donors.\u201d\n\nJustice Democrats was instrumental in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s upset victory over former Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) in the 2018 midterm elections, and has allied itself with a slate of other progressive members of Congress \u2014 including Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s fellow \u201csquad\u201d members Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\n\nThose lawmakers\u2019 significant public profile and advocacy for a new generation of party leadership has spooked less liberal House Democrats fearful of primary rivals outflanking them from the left. Shortly after the 2018 elections, Justice Democrats put incumbents on notice for the threat of primary challengers, causing tensions to run high throughout the Democratic caucus.\n\nBut Newman, as opposed to other incumbent challengers, has been blessed by more mainstream Democratic figures. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, have all endorsed her campaign.\n\nNewman previously lost to Lipinski in the 2018 Democratic primary for his House seat by roughly 2,000 votes. He is one of the most conservative House Democrats and has long drawn ire within the party over his opposition to abortion rights.\n\nThis report first appeared on politico.com on Sept. 17, 2019.", "description": "Ocasio-Cortez will support Marie Newman\u2019s bid to oust Dan Lipinski in Illinois' 3rd congressional district.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a7/c3/735166ce427ab4965682afa4d8bd/0816aoc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
