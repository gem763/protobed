The Canadiens dropped their season opener 4-3 to the Carolina Hurricanes in a shootout on Thursday.\n\nMontreal got on the board just 68 seconds into the first period when Domi took a feed from Artturi Lehkonen on a 2-on-1 and beat Hutchinson on Montreal's second shot of the game.\n\nKerfoot and Matthews both had chances to get the Leafs back even soon after before Toronto eventually tied things up at 5:57 on sequence that started when Nylander created a turnover at the Canadiens' blue line. The puck eventually found its way to Matthews, who ripped his fourth on bullet a one-timer.\n\nThe home side grabbed the lead at 15:54 when Moore stripped Canadiens rookie winger Nick Suzuki behind Price's goal and fed Kerfoot, who snapped his first in blue and white after coming over along with Barrie in the Nazem Kadri trade with the Colorado Avalanche this summer.\n\nWeber crushed Tavares with a clean check along the boards later in the period, but the latter was none the worse for wear.\n\nMoore, who scored against Ottawa, doubled his total at 1:29 of the second, finishing off a 2-on-1 break with Ilya Mikheyev.\n\nTavares nearly made it 4-1 on a power play, but his one-timer off a pass from Marner rattled the crossbar and stayed out.\n\nMatthews almost got his second of the game and fifth of the campaign later in the period on another man advantage only to have his stick explode on contact with Price at his mercy.\n\nHutchinson, who won the backup job behind Frederik Andersen in training camp, didn't have a whole lot to do, but was sharp later in the period \u2014 shooting a blocker out to deny Tomas Tatar and smothering a Jordan Weal deflection.\n\nPrice stopped Marner in tight early in the third to keep his team within striking distance before the Leafs winger sent a follow-up shot wide.\n\nThe Montreal goalie then robbed Matthews on another power play, but couldn't do anything on Nylander's shot through the pads for his first at 5:16 before the Canadiens pushed back to set up a wild finish.", "description": "The Toronto Maple Leafs blew a 4-1 lead in the third period, before Paul Byron scored the lone goal in the shootout as the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-5 on Saturday for their first win of the season.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5310808.1570325192!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/leafs-sens-100519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
