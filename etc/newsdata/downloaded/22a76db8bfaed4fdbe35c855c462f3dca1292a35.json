Bernie Sanders expected to be endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at first rally post heart attack", "language": "en", "text": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is returning to New York City for a large rally to mark his return to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1.\n\nInterested in Bernie Sanders?

Add Interest\n\nThe event, dubbed the \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally,\u201d is expected to draw thousands of supporters and highlight the endorsement of progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Two senior sources with the Sanders team told reporters at the close of Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate that Ocasio-Cortez would accompany Sanders at the campaign rally.\n\nWin Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nThe rally is being held at Queensbridge Park along the East River in Queens, just miles from Ocasio-Cortez' district. Ocasio-Cortez served as an organizer for Sander's 2016 run and the two have introduced bold climate change plans.\n\nOther members of the so-called squad -- or liberal freshman congresswomen of color -- have been tied to Sanders\u2019 presidential bid. Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar announced her endorsement of Bernie Sanders with a video earlier this week. Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib hasn\u2019t endorsed Sanders, but is slated to tour her district with the senator later this month.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe rally comes at critical time for the Sanders campaign. Despite raising $25.3 million during the third quarter, national polling data compiled by ABC affiliate FiveThirtyEight shows Sanders backsliding in many of the polls, falling just short of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nResults from an Oct. 14 Quinnipiac University poll showed primary voter support for Sanders fell around 11%, compared to Biden's 27% and Warren's 30%.\n\nThis is Sanders\u2019 first campaign event -- aside from the Oct. 15 Democratic debate -- since his heart attack in Nevada and it could serve as a means to reinvigorate his campaign.", "description": "Sen.
