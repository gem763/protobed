The prohibition on face masks will have a \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d to stop violence at protests and help police enforce the law, she told reporters, adding that the measure didn\u2019t mean Hong Kong was under a state of emergency.\n\n\u201cThe violence is destroying Hong Kong,\u201d Lam said. \u201cWe must save the present Hong Kong and the future Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201dAs a responsible government we have duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calmness in society,\u201d she added. \u201cWe believe the new law will crate a deterrent effect against masked, violent protesters and rioters and will assist the police.\u201d\n\nViolators of the ban, which will include exemptions, could get a jail term of as much as one year or a fine of HK$25,000 ($3,190), according to a copy of the document handed to reporters. People will have a reasonable excuse to use facial coverings if required for physical safety at work, for religious purposes, or for a pre-existing medical or health reason, Lam said.\n\nThe face mask has become a symbol of resistance among protesters who fear retribution if they are identified: China has already applied pressure to businesses such as Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. to fire employees who have participated in demonstrations. The move to invoke colonial-era emergency powers -- last used more than 50 years ago -- comes shortly after a protester was shot in violent demonstrations that once again shook the city on Oct. 1, as President Xi Jinping celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule in Beijing.\n\nProtesters already hit the streets on Friday in anticipation of the announcement, and vowed to continue with demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThis is like opening a Pandora\u2019s box -- who knows what will come next after this ban?\u201d said one man protesting in central Hong Kong on Friday afternoon, who only gave his surname Lau. \u201cBut the government should know that if it insists, and doesn\u2019t listen to the people, we won\u2019t give up and will keep the government accountable. We will continue our fight.\u201d\n\nHong Kong stocks fell ahead of the briefing, before paring slightly as officials spoke. The Hang Seng Index was 1.2% lower as of 3:28 p.m. The move would\n\nFirst passed by the British government in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike in Hong Kong\u2019s harbor, the emergency law was last used by the colonial administration to help put down riots that rocked the trading hub in 1967. Denounced by protest leaders as a form of martial law, it could give the government greater leeway to arrest citizens, censor publications, shut off communications networks and search premises without warrants, among other measures.\n\nHong Kong to Enact Rare Emergency Rule for Mask Ban, Reports Say\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terrified of the possible backlash,\u201d said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong. \u201cThe young are saying they\u2019re prepared to die for this cause. They\u2019ll still be out there wearing their masks. And the police will charge at them.\u201d\n\nPolice fired tear gas and pepper spray at protesters in the residential area of Tai Koo Thursday night as demonstrations erupted at 11 sites and shopping centers across the city following the reports, the SCMP said. There were also calls for a protest in the Central business district at 12:30 p.m. on Friday.\n\nIn China, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper, said in a tweet that Western countries shouldn\u2019t apply \u201cnasty double standards\u201d when reacting to the ban, while noting that Canada and the U.S. state of New York were reported to have similar laws.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s strong demand in Hong Kong calling for anti-mask law,\u201d Hu said. \u201cMost of the violent activities in Hong Kong were committed by masked rioters.\u201d\n\nThe law would be difficult to enforce, the Post reported, and could spur court challenges as a rights violation. One police inspector, who requested anonymity, told the Post that the move would stir up more trouble.\n\nIt could also fuel further international condemnation of Lam\u2019s government. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, called for the U.S. to stand up to China in Hong Kong. She also urged America to stop exports of police gear to the city and provide temporary protected status to its residents.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than half a century to ban face masks for protesters in a bid to quell months of violent unrest.Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the measure on Friday during a press briefing with 16 members of her cabinet,", "authors": ["Dominic Lau", "Iain Marlow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/56MzLtOqSwhQ.XXkaGsXig--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/8dea86cd2e8d85272e4f1056d7fc499d", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
