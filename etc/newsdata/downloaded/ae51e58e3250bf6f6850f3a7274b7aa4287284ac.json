The author illustrates through many examples how the power of interest, passion, and perseverance move people and ideas forward. I can really identify with this book's message: 'believe in your passion, identify a goal, and persevere through grit.' Grit is really all about the reaction to getting knocked down again and again, and how success is achieved by learning from failure. In the book: 'To be gritty is to fall down seven times and rise eight.' I really cannot count how many times I have been down face first. A couple times not even sure I would be able to get up again. But I always seem to, and most times move forward after the knockdown with a better understanding of what I have to do to succeed. To me, this is really the essence of being gritty.\"", "description": "Here are good titles to check out to boost your motivation, according to\u00a0successful executives\u00a0who offer their rationales for reading them.", "authors": ["Christina Desmarais"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6fda9f2e22af410c077fe2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
