The Supreme Court, at the time, chose to dismiss the lawsuit and ruled in favor of Amazon. According to the SCOTUS ruling, Amazon wasn\u2019t required to pay employees for time spent doing things that weren\u2019t integral to their job.\n\nThe workers\u2019 beef lay in their assertion that these checkout procedures took as long as 25 minutes and were required at the beginning and end of workers\u2019 shifts. Amazon denied these allegations and said the plaintiffs were exaggerating.\n\nAfter SCOTUS ruled in 2014 that Amazon didn\u2019t have to pay, it appeared that the lawsuit would go away. But the team behind the initial suit decided to challenge the SCOTUS ruling by trying to get the case heard in a state court. While the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t have direct control over the machinations of state governments, Amazon filed an appeal against the resurrection of the case with SCOTUS in hopes that it would intercede. It won\u2019t.\n\nThis means the original case will likely move forward in Nevada and, potentially, could become a class-action lawsuit involving Amazon workers in other states as well.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court\u2019s original decision was unanimous, a lower court ruled the case could continue in state courts because the state of Nevada interprets the word \u201cwork\u201d differently than the federal government. A 1974 Supreme Court ruling protects employers from being \u201cforced\u201d to pay for activities not intrinsic to an employee\u2019s ability to complete the work they were hired for. As the New York Times reported after the 2014 ruling:\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the screenings were not \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to the workers\u2019 jobs, which involved retrieving products from warehouse shelves and packaging them for delivery to Amazon\u2019s customers. That meant, he said, that no extra pay was required.\n\nApparently Nevada sees things differently. According to a report from Business Insider, Amazon fears the decision could \u201ccreate a \u201croad-map\u201d for courts interpreting wage-and-hour statutes in other states.\u201d In other words: the company worth a trillion dollars is worried that workers may figure out a way to get paid for the time they\u2019re required to be at work. That seems like a slippery slope towards a world where Amazon\u2018s required to provide fair pay for fair work \u2013 a scenario that would likely be unsustainable given the company\u2019s current practices.\n\nRead next: MacOS Catalina is available for download now", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F07%2Famazon-boxes-prime-2017.jpg&signature=95ab90573efb75bd1622521599351428", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
