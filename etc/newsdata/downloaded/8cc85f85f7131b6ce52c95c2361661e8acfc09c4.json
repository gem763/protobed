(AP) - The author of a hot-button California bill limiting medical exemptions for vaccinations on Friday accepted Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s last-minute demand for additional changes, setting up a final series of votes before lawmakers adjourn for the year next week.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Richard Pan of Sacramento amended a companion bill to reflect the governor\u2019s wishes, days after lawmakers sent Newsom a bill cracking down on doctors who sell fraudulent medical exemptions.\n\nPan said in a statement he appreciates Newsom\u2019s commitment to sign the bill and the amendments, which he says will \u201censure we maintain the community immunity needed to protect our kids.\u201d\n\nThe amendments would give school children grace periods that could last several years on existing medical exemptions. For instance, a kindergartener with an exemption could retain it through 6th grade, while a 7th grader could be exempted through high school.\n\nThat is similar to the phase-out period allowed when California eliminated personal belief vaccine exemptions in 2015, officials said.\n\nAnother new provision could revoke any medical exemptions written by Robert Sears, a Southern California doctor who has been disciplined by the Medical Board of California for writing an improper vaccine exemption.\n\nThe provision would apply to exemptions written by any doctor who has faced disciplinary action, but at this time Sears is the only California doctor to be disciplined regarding vaccine exemptions, said Carlos Villatoro, a medical board spokesman.\n\nSears told The Los Angeles Times it would result in hundreds of his patients losing their exemptions.\n\n\u201cThis seems like a broad overreach from a government that is supposed to protect its medically fragile children,\u201d he said.\n\nOther changes would make it clear that enforcement will start next year, meaning doctors who previously granted a high number of medical exemptions won\u2019t face scrutiny.\n\nThey also would remove a requirement that doctors swear under penalty of perjury that they are not charging fees to fill out medical exemption forms. And one change would ensure that an expert panel reviewing appeals of exemption denials could consider additional information from the doctor beyond the exemption form.\n\nNewsom spokesman Nathan Click said the governor would sign the bill once the new amendments have also won legislative approval.\n\n\u201cThese amendments clarify legal and administrative processes in SB276 in order to ensure medical providers, parents, school administrators and public health officials know the rules of the road once it takes effect,\u201d Click said in a statement, referencing the bill number.\n\nNewsom\u2019s 11th-hour demands had roiled the Legislature and frustrated the bill\u2019s supporters, all of whom were caught by surprise when he announced them in a tweet this week.\n\nIt prompted several newspapers across California to editorially question the freshman governor\u2019s commitment to limiting vaccine exemptions during a year of record measles outbreaks.\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, a fellow Democrat from San Diego, said both chambers plan to vote on the companion bill on Monday, with the understanding that Newsom would then sign the original measure.\n\nSigning the bill would also counter opponents who have threatened and harassed Pan and other lawmakers over the pending legislation, she said: \u201cIt is important that we send the message that loud and violent will not drown out reason and science in how we govern California.\u201d\n\nThe last-minute amendments are unlikely to mollify opponents who have swarmed the Capitol and had hoped Newsom might veto the bill, given his insistence on significant changes in June and again this week.\n\nBut the compromise pleased the bill\u2019s supporters.\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, California, chief executive Kris Calvin and Vaccinate California executive director Leah Russin both praised Newsom and Pan for working out their differences.\n\nRussin called the agreement \u201ca victory for science over fear and for sound public health policy over conspiracy and misinformation,\u201d while also urging Newsom to immediately sign the bill already on his desk.\n\nCalvin said her group supports the amendments if it means both bills become law.\n\n\u201cWe are perfectly satisfied that this bill will satisfy its objective of making sure that bogus medical exemptions are uncovered \u2026 while protecting valid medical exemptions,\u201d Calvin said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Kathleen Ronayne contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The author of a hot-button California bill limiting medical exemptions for vaccinations on Friday accepted Gov.
