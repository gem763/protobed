Footage on social media showed the Bosnian defender Kolasinac chasing off two moped attackers who were wearing helmets and dark clothing.\n\nThe club decided against selecting \u00d6zil and Kolasinac for the league opener away to Newcastle on 11 August \u201cfollowing further security incidents\u201d but the pair have since returned to the first-team fold.\n\n\u00d6zil told The Athletic (\u00a3): \u201cSead\u2019s reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers. The second one was in front of my car on his moped so I couldn\u2019t drive.\n\n\u201cWe were newly wed and I was scared about my wife. I was scared about Sead. I wasn\u2019t thinking about myself. I was worried they were going to open my wife\u2019s door and they tried, so I reached across her to keep it closed.\n\n\u201cNothing happened to us, that\u2019s the most important thing. We were worried these guys had been targeting us, but the police said they found them and, a few hours earlier, they tried to robbed other people nearby in a similar way.\u201d\n\nSince the horrific ordeal, Kolasinac has played seven times for Arsenal, but \u00d6zil has been largely out in the cold. The World Cup winner has started only one Premier League game and made one other appearance in the Carabao Cup. But he has no intention of leaving the Emirates, having signed a new three-and-a-half year contract worth \u00a3350,000 per week in January 2018.\n\n\u201cI have a contract until the summer of 2021 and I will be staying until then,\u201d \u00d6zil said. \u201cWhen I signed the new deal, I thought about it very carefully and said it was one of the most important decisions of my footballing career.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay for just one or two more years, I wanted to commit my future to Arsenal and the club wanted me to do the same. You can go through difficult times, like this, but that is no reason to run away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be an Arsenal player, a fan and I\u2019m happy here. Whenever people see me in the street I always say, \u2019This is my home\u2019. I\u2019m going nowhere.\u201d", "description": "%u2018I%20was%20scared%20about%20my%20wife%u2019%3A%20Arsenal%u2019s%20Mesut%20%D6zil%20opens%20up%20on%20carjacking%20%7C%20Mesut%20Ozil%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
