Strangely, one company has continued to prosper \u2014 a comfy, dumpy, unlikely survivor of the postrecession crash: UGGs.\n\nAfter a brief anti-UGG moment circa 2010 (of the \u201cTen Trends We Pray Would Disappear\u201d assortment), UGGs came trotting back on the feet of this stylish quintet: Rihanna, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kendall Jenner, and Sarah Paulson, who, I\u2019m happy to report, wore them with a pair of Rachel Comey jeans on the set of Ocean\u2019s Eight. And this month, Eckhaus Latta anounced their second UGG collaboration \u2014 the sixth luxury brand to do so in the last few years (Heron Preston, Sacai, BAPE, Jeremy Scott, and Y/Project \u2014 whose version is both thigh-high and for men \u2014 all have UGG collections of their own). Below, 20 types of UGGs for those who would like to invest in what I\u2019m personally starting to think might be a timeless brand.
