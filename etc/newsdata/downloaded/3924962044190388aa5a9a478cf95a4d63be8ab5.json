He was produced in court on Wednesday and remanded in custody.\n\n\"We created a special cell to track him down and arrest him. It was our longest chase, it went on for six years,\" said Mr Sirothia, who heads the forest department's special task force.\n\nFound in the southern parts of Madhya Pradesh, the Pardhi-Behelia tribe has traditionally lived in forests and depended on hunting for survival.\n\nImage copyright Courtesy: MP Wildlife STF Image caption Yarlen is alleged to have hunted sloth bears and tigers, among other endangered animals\n\nHunting of wild animals is illegal in India, including for tribal communities, though ritual forest hunting continues. The Indian government says it is working to provide alternative livelihoods to tribespeople but many continue to live on the fringes of society.\n\nYarlen was first arrested in 2013 after police found two sloth bear carcasses from the Kanha national park missing genitalia and gall bladders.\n\nHe spent a year in jail before being freed on bail and going on the run, police said. Bear bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gall bladder, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years and fetches a high price in the illegal international market.\n\nMr Sirothia said there were six cases registered against Yarlen in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh under Cites (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). Three of the cases involve the poaching of tigers.", "description": "Indian police hail the arrest of a man wanted for tiger and bear poaching after a years-long chase.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15CA6/production/_109345298_gettyimages-1048916330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
