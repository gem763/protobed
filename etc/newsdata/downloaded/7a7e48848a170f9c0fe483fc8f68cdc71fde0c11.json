One, of course, is to ignore it. Do nothing. That\u2019s what he\u2019s done so far, as I write this at 10:50 a.m. ET.\n\nBut no one thinks that\u2019s going to last. Not with the media taunting him this morning about how he was received.\n\nTwo is to laugh it off. Who cares? Politics is what it is, man.\n\nImagine if Trump just said \u201cbaseball fans boo sometimes and cheer other times. Step into the arena, you can expect some jeers! Great time at the ballpark!\u201d \u2014 Tim Carney (@TPCarney) October 28, 2019\n\nThree is to overreact by anxiously trying to spin something so trivial. He could deny that there was much booing \u2014 \u201cfake boos!\u201d, as Jeryl Bier jokes. Then we\u2019ll have a full day \u2014 or a full week \u2014 of the media trying to prove that he\u2019s lying. It\u2019ll be the Alabama hurricane fiasco all over again.\n\nOr he\u2019ll remind everyone of the crowd\u2019s partisan leanings. \u201cWashington is a Democratic city!\u201d Which is true, of course.\n\nWATCH: President Trump met with loud boos as he is introduced at the World Series in Nationals Park on Sunday night. pic.twitter.com/4RTW8ZqxqP \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 28, 2019\n\nPresident Trump was booed loudly by the fans at Nats Park when he was shown on the big screen.\n\nThen came a loud chant: \u201cLock him up.\u201d @wusa9 pic.twitter.com/LBbgSAHd6k \u2014 Adam Longo (@adamlongoTV) October 28, 2019\n\nLook how Trump\u2019s face changes when he realizes an entire stadium is booing him pic.twitter.com/E46rzbzmbl \u2014 Arlen Parsa (@arlenparsa) October 28, 2019\n\nThe overlap between MAGA Nation and the sort of people who can afford a ticket to a World Series game in Washington D.C. is small, and Trump knew it going in. Rob Manfred, the commissioner of baseball, said that POTUS declined to throw out the first pitch \u201cin order to make the fan experience as positive as possible.\u201d I\u2019m surprised he\u2019d put himself in a position where something like this was apt to happen, given his sensitivity to the idea that he\u2019s unpopular.\n\nMaybe he thought the success of the al-Baghdadi raid would turn the crowd in his favor, if only for one night.\n\nMy recommendation: Since virtually all Nats fans are lobbyists, journalists, lawyers, or politicians/staffers, he should treat their contempt as a badge of honor. \u201cNats fans are swampy trash!\u201d he might tweet. And he would be right.\n\nOr, if he wants to really sting them, he could point out that the team dropped all three of its home games in the Series and say that they\u2019re a bunch of \u201clightweight chockers.\u201d\n\nBecause even the silliest nothings, like a politician being booed at a game, are now take-fodder in the era of 24/7 content, the chatterati (mostly on the left) are embroiled in a serious debate this morning about the propriety of what happened. Progressives see nothing sinful about hooting at a man whom they regard as a sleaze and a criminal; centrist establishmentarians like Joe Scarborough and Chris Coons, as you\u2019ll see below, are either chagrined to see the office being disrespected or mortified that chanting about locking up a political opponent is now firmly bipartisan. It\u2019s gonna be a long news day.\n\nSo let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got this straight: When crowds chant \u201cLock her up\u201d toward Hillary, it is illiberal and anti-American.\n\n(I agree). But when crowds chant the same toward Trump,\n\nit is suddenly a fulsome exercise of sacred First Amendment rights. What hypocritical clowns. \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) October 28, 2019\n\n\"We are Americans and we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant 'Lock him up' to this president or to any president.\" \u2014 @JoeNBC pic.twitter.com/9IgMCETBdn \u2014 Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) October 28, 2019", "description": "Opinion.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-23.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
