But what he did wasn't criminal. It was a mistake. He went to see a friend to tell them he couldn't be their friend any more.'\n\nDespite this, it has been established that Epstein organised a dinner in Andrew's honour during that visit with guests including Woody Allen, Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, Chelsea Handler and George Stephanopoulos.\n\nThe duke was then pictured waving to a young woman leaving the mansion where the FBI later found thousands of graphic photos with many of underage girls.\n\nThe FBI has announced it will be expanding its investigation into Epstein hoping to identify more victims who could provide information on other abusers.\n\nSources close to Prince Andrew say he doubts the authenticity of a photo with his arm around the waist of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, then aged 17\n\nThe Department of Justice said it would not give Andrew any special treatment because of his royal status.\n\nAnother embarrassment for the duke is a 2001 photograph of him with his arm around the waist of Roberts Giuffre who was then 17.\n\nBut sources close to the duke say he doubts the photo's authenticity and says the original has never surfaced.\n\nHowever, the Department of Justice and the FBI believe the photo is genuine.", "description": "Prince Andrew visited the financier's \u00a360million Manhattan house in December 2010, shortly after Epstein had been released from an 18-month sentence for child prostitution offences.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/09/19356382-0-image-a-2_1570351808323.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
