Sections of the ballpark chanted \"Lock him up\" \u2014 a spin on Trump's refrain against Hillary Clinton that has remained common at his rallies, even after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump, standing next to first lady Melania Trump, appeared unperturbed by the din, smiling and clapping before moving to say something to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nLater in the game, fans unfurled a \"VETERANS FOR IMPEACHMENT\" banner right behind home plate.\n\nIn a press conference before the game, Washington Nationals manager Dave Martinez said of Trump: \"He's coming to the game. He's a fan. Hopefully he cheers for the Washington Nationals, and I hope he enjoys the game.\"\n\nAsked if the Nationals wanted Trump there, Martinez said: \"We haven't really talked about it. We're focusing on playing baseball.\"\n\nThe Nationals ended up getting walloped by the Houston Astros, 7-1. They now trail 3-2 in the best-of-seven series.\n\nIt's rare to see Trump out in public in Washington, a Democratic stronghold in which just 4% of residents voted for Trump in the 2016 general election.\n\nIn a break with tradition, Trump did not throw out the ceremonial first pitch Sunday night, as is customary when a sitting president attends a baseball game.\n\nWhile league officials said Trump said he was not interested in throwing the first pitch, citing concerns about slowing down thousands of fans entering the ballpark, Nationals principal owner Mark Lerner indicated that there were many other first pitch candidates who were considered before the president.\n\nLast week, Trump told reporters that the bulletproof vest he would have to wear made the idea of tossing the ball from the mound unappealing.\n\n\"They gotta dress me up in a lot of heavy armor. I'll look too heavy. I don't like that,\" Trump said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Roberson/AP Jeff Roberson/AP\n\nInstead of the president, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a Spanish-born chef and Washington restaurateur known for providing free emergency meals to victims of natural disasters as well as to furloughed federal workers through his organization World Central Kitchen, threw out the first pitch to stadium-wide applause.\n\nAndr\u00e9s has long been an outspoken critic of Trump, especially the president's hardline immigration policies.\n\nIn 2015, Andr\u00e9s pulled out of a plan to open a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in Washington after then-candidate Trump made disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants, calling them drug dealers and rapists as he campaigned.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Andr\u00e9s thanked the Nationals and the MLB for inviting an immigrant to throw the first pitch.", "description": "Baseball fans booed President Trump in Washington on Sunday, hours after he announced the death of a terrorist.
