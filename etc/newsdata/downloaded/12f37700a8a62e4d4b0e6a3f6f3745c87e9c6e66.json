This limits the number of buyers who qualify to buy properties. But, that said, the market is still relatively strong, as unemployment and interest rates are at record lows.\"\n\nBenson says property will always appeal to high-net-worth investors, thanks to underlying strong fundamentals. \"Over a 10-year period property values have always historically increased in value. The median house price in Sydney over a 10-year period in 2008 was $560,000, now it's in excess of $1 million.\"\n\nThere are a number of different ways wealthy investors are exploiting opportunities in residential markets, according to Michael Beresford, director of investment services property group OpenCorp.\n\n\"High-net-worth investors buy in blue-chip areas that they like, regardless of whether that provides the best return,\" he says.\n\n\"Many high-net-worth investors also understand the significant compound growth benefits obtained by holding multiple, affordable properties.\n\n\"History has shown affordable properties have a higher capital growth rate compared to blue-chip areas, contrary to popular opinion. The significantly lower holding costs and wider diversification that is possible with a larger property portfolio is appealing.\"\n\nBeresford says commercial property still provides an attractive option in a diversified portfolio, especially for people who own businesses that operate from these premises.\n\n\"But these days, many high-net-worth investors would rather grow a substantial and diversified residential portfolio across multiple locations nationally.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuccess with commercial investments requires an understanding of businesses and financial reports as well as the valuation risk tied to the lease terms. So their preference is to take advantage of capital growth through residential property, based on basic supply and demand dynamics where population growth is strong and housing is undersupplied.\"\n\nJohn Oehlers, managing director of Professionals Real Estate Tamworth, who splits his time between that city and Sydney, says there also are opportunities for wealthy investors in regional areas.\n\n\"Our high-net-worth clients are thinking differently about property. Their mindset and investment strategies are becoming weighted towards certainty rather than speculation. This is being achieved through flexible lending strategies and commercial real estate,\" he says.\n\nIn particular, Oehlers says wealthy investors want flexibility around debt structures, locking in fixed portions over varying terms.\n\n\"There is a real focus on buying commercial real estate assets that have long-term leases with national, multinational and government tenants. Clients are actually acutely aware of the uncertainty in markets and property is providing piece of mind,\" he says.\n\n\"They want A-grade tenants on long-term leases and are looking to opt out of residential property unless they either have genuine development experience or a higher propensity for variables to create larger returns.\"\n\nAccording to Beresford, trusts remain an attractive structural vehicle for wealthy investors to hold property. \"Asset protection is a consideration among this demographic, as well as being able to pass assets to beneficiaries most effectively to maximise control and minimise tax payable.\"\n\nOehlers agrees trusts are a popular way to hold property assets. \"Only very rarely would we see a high-net-worth investor use anything other than a trust to buy property. Occasionally we see our clients invest in property in their own names, but family and unit trusts are really the preferred vehicle.\"\n\nMortgage Choice CEO Susan Mitchell says many high-net-worths invest in unlisted property trusts via their self-managed super fund or family trust, as the entry and exit fees are low and returns are higher, with less hassle than taking direct investments.\n\n\"Some clients who had invested in property trusts during the financial crisis of 2007 are still wary of them as they were one of the worst performers during that period. However, some newer investors appreciate the diversification opportunity and see property trusts as attractive options, as recent history shows positive growth and income returns,\" she says.\n\nOehlers agrees says self-managed super funds have become a popular option for wealthy people to invest in property over the past 10 years. \"Investing in real estate via a proprietary limited trading company seems to have its limitations, according to some of our high-net-worth clients, though every situation varies.\"", "description": "Wealthy property investors remain focused on yield in a pervasively low interest rate environment.
