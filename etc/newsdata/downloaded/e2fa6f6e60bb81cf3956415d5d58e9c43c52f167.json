Biden is being conducted by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s the California Democrat who stands alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for every televised update on the investigation.\n\nRepublicans accuse him of running an unfair, partisan inquisition behind closed doors. But predictably, the GOP minority\u2019s attempts to punish the California Democrat fell short Monday.\n\nDespite having more than 170 co-sponsors, Republicans failed to crack into the Democratic majority firewall. The resolution was tabled \u2014 and effectively killed \u2014 on a 218-185 vote.\n\nHouse Republicans argued Mr. Schiff should be removed from his position as the investigation\u2019s frontman because of his staff\u2019s early connection to the whistleblower who put forward the allegations against Mr. Trump and for leading an unfair, secretive and biased process.\n\n\u201cRight now, one person is having all of the power, instead of the people across America actually have a say in this process. And now they are bringing Adam Schiff, who has lied numerous times to the American public, in charge of this process?\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Fox News this weekend.\n\n\u201cThey are denying members of Congress from even being in the room or hearing the transcripts and reading them of what\u2019s being said. Adam Schiff controls who can come into the room,\u201d he added.\n\nOne Republican lawmaker compared Mr. Schiff\u2019s impeachment inquiry to McCarthyism.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff has done more to discredit Congress than Joseph McCarthy. Both have trafficked in false accusations and railroaded witnesses. At least McCarthy had the nerve to hold public hearings,\u201d North Carolina Rep. Mark Walker said in a statement.\n\nMr. Schiff is no stranger to fighting with Mr. Trump and the Republicans.\n\nThe California Democrat was one the most vocal lawmakers in his party when allegations of collusion with Russian actors emerged with the Steele dossier, which contained several unverified allegations against the president.\n\nAnd as Republicans, led by then-Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, sought to look into whether the Trump campaign was illegally spied on, Mr. Schiff sparred with them over FISA court revelations.\n\nThat framed him as an anti-Trump hero for those on the left and the poster boy for the conspiracies against the president for those on the right.\n\nFor most of Democrats\u2019 time in their reclaimed House majority, the impeachment push was focused on the Russia allegations probed by special counsel Robert Mueller, which fell under House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler\u2019s purview.\n\nWhile Democrats steadily trickled out in support of at least an impeachment inquiry into the president, the Mueller investigation never created a watershed moment for the party.\n\nAll that changed when the whistleblower\u2019s allegations against Mr. Trump were publicly reported.\n\nMr. Schiff, at the time still a holdout on impeachment, was one of the first top Democrats to say the allegations may have tipped the scales \u2014 that Mr. Trump may have \u201ccrossed the Rubicon\u201d \u2014 and helped crack the dam on the party\u2019s resistance to impeachment.\n\nDemocrats have remained firmly in Mr. Schiff\u2019s corner as Republicans ramped up their attacks, which Monday\u2019s vote proved.\n\nTop Democrats have brushed off criticism that the California Democrat is secretly rigging the process against the minority party \u2014 comparing their impeachment inquiry to special prosecutor investigations in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments.\n\n\u201cChairman Schiff is a great American patriot,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement following the vote Monday. \u201cWhat the Republicans fear most is the truth. The president betrayed the oath of office, our national security and the integrity of our elections, and the GOP has not even tried to deny the facts. Instead, Republicans stage confusion, undermine the Constitution and attack the person of whom the president is most afraid.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
