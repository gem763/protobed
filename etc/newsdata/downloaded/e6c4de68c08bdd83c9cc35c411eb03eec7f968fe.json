I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u201cWhistleblower.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Big Consequences!\u201d\n\nThe White House was thrown into chaos after the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was made last month.\n\nThe complaint was triggered by a 25 July phone call between Donald Trump and Volodyyr Zelensky, in which the president appeared to urge the Ukranian leader to investigate Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic frontrunner.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s remarks reportedly caused alarm and the whistleblower, who is believed to be a member of the intelligence community, submitted the official complaint on 12 August.\n\nIn the wake of the scandal Democrats have announced an official impeachment inquiry. Many accused the president of pressuring a vulnerable ally for personal political gain.\n\nThe inquiry is being led by the intelligence committee, helmed by Adam Schiff.\n\nMr Schiff chaired a hearing on 26 September during which he questioned Joseph Maguire, Mr Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence.\n\nDuring the hearing the spy chief declined to discuss whether he spoke to the president about the complaint in question, saying his conversations with Mr Trump are \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the acting spy chief said he welcomed congress\u2019 oversight duties, adding: \u201cI am not partisan and I am not political\u201d.\n\nHe also said he did not know the identity of the whistleblower, but when asked whether he believed the anonymous individual was a \u201cpartisan hack\u201d as the president has said, Mr Maguire responded: \u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing.\u201d\n\nMr Maguire described foreign election interference as \u201cunwarranted,\u201d adding: \u201cIt is unwelcome. It is bad for the nation.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff has said he expects the whistleblower to come before his committee in the near future.\n\nThe president has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.", "description": "Donald Trump has raised the spectre of divisions akin to a\u00a0civil war\u00a0in the US in the event that he is impeached, in a series of incendiary posts on Twitter.
