Having had cancer twice before, she knew the suffering the disease, treated or untreated, would entail. And as she hesitated over what course to take, she, like much of the world, was looking at the pictures coming out of Abu Ghraib. This had been one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s most notorious prisons, and was now in US hands. The pictures showed soldiers torturing Iraqis: chaining them to walls; forcing them to stand in painful and humiliating positions; piling them, naked, into human pyramids.\n\nYou could tell the Americans were having fun. The images they created had not been kept secret. They had been sent to friends, posted to Facebook, taken and spread with a new gadget: a mobile telephone that incorporated a camera. This technology had been gaining users since the beginning of the decade. But if the tools were new, the questions the images raised, about which representations were appropriate and which were obscene, went back at least to the Greeks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There is aggression implicit in every use of the camera\u2019 \u2026 a hooded and wired Iraqi prisoner in the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003.

The moment, she said, split her life in two. From then on, in book after book, she tried to understand how images, especially images of suffering and war, reflected reality \u2013 and how they falsified or commodified it. Was it appropriate to take pictures of other people\u2019s suffering? And when such images appeared, was it more grotesque to look \u2013or to look away?\n\nAnd so Sontag went to work on what became her final published essay, Regarding the Torture of Others. Throughout her career, she had shown the dangers of separating things from their proper names. Aristotle wrote that metaphor \u201cconsists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else\u201d. If that sounded abstract, Sontag would show how the abuse of language could break people\u2019s bodies. Among metaphor\u2019s sinister powers was its ability to twist language in the service of evil causes.\n\nThe Iraq war began with bad metaphors. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,\u201d said Condoleezza Rice, then President George W Bush\u2019s national security adviser. In England, the \u201cdodgy dossier\u201d showing that Iraq was hiding prohibited weapons was, in the words of a British official, \u201csexed up\u201d. The lead-up to the war began in September 2002. Why then? Well, Bush\u2019s chief of staff explained, \u201cfrom a marketing point of view, you don\u2019t introduce new products in August\u201d.\n\nWhen the results of these words became evident \u2013 estimates suggest between 465,000 and 1.2 million Iraqis died \u2013 those responsible tried to separate the reality from its representation. The president claimed to be shocked and disgusted by the photographs, Sontag wrote, \u201cas if the fault or horror lay in the images, not in what they depict\u201d. Legalese replaced clear words: \u201cThere was also the avoidance of the word \u2018torture,\u2019\u201d she noted.\n\nThose held in the extra-legal US penal empire had become \u201cdetainees\u201d; the newly obsolete word \u201cprisoners\u201d might suggest that they had the rights accorded by international law and the laws of all civilised countries. This endless \u201cglobal war on terrorism\u201d \u2013 into which both the quite justified invasion of Afghanistan and the unwinnable folly in Iraq have been folded by Pentagon decree \u2013 inevitably leads to the demonising and dehumanising of anyone declared by the Bush administration to be a terrorist: a definition that is not up for debate and is, in fact, usually made in secret.\n\nInto these fraught meanings entered the camera. Years before, in her great collection On Photography, Sontag had called it a \u201cpredatory weapon\u201d and said that \u201cthere is aggression implicit in every use of the camera\u201d. Now, she saw the Abu Ghraib pictures being made by people who recorded torture exactly as they recorded everything else.\n\n\u201cAndy Warhol\u2019s ideal of filming real events in real time \u2013 life isn\u2019t edited, why should its record be edited? \u2013 has become a norm,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHere I am \u2013 waking and yawning and stretching, brushing my teeth, making breakfast, getting the kids off to school.\u201d The camera made all events equal: \u201cThe distinction between photograph and reality \u2013 as between spin and policy \u2013 can easily evaporate.\u201d As Warhol had predicted, it made people equal to their metaphors. \u201cThe photographs are us,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe admitted that there would be no \u201cecology of images\u201d as she had once hoped, no way to check their proliferation. And so the image had to be made a positive weapon. Pictures had to be wielded against other pictures, as artists since Goya had endeavoured to do.\n\n\u201cThe pictures will not go away,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is the nature of the digital world in which we live \u2026 Up to then, there had been only words, which are easier to cover up in our age of infinite digital self-reproduction and self-dissemination, and so much easier to forget.\u201d\n\nSoon after the essay was published, Sontag elected to have a bone marrow transplant. \u201cTorture is not too strong a word,\u201d a friend of hers said. But her own bouts with the camera were not over. As she underwent the terrible treatment, her partner, Annie Leibovitz, was taking pictures of her: bloated, writhing, and then, finally, dead. When these pictures were published, after Sontag\u2019s death, they ignited a fierce debate. The questions \u2013 about the ethics of photography, about how to regard the pain of others \u2013 were a homage to Sontag\u2019s final thoughts.\n\n\u2022 Sontag: Her Life and Work by Benjamin Moser is published by Allen Lane on 17 September.
