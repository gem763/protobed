It runs from Sept. 20 to Nov. 2 and has been tough for the Canadians.\n\nFor the second straight World Cup, they've lost every game they've played.\n\nCancelled matches are logged as 0-0 ties, and teams get two competition points each. Canada, ranked 22nd in the world, had targeted the game against No. 23 Namibia as its best chance at a victory.\n\nRees said the cancellation was \"bitterly disappointing.\"\n\n\"It was probably the most important match for the Canadian players at this tournament,\" he said. \"It was devastating and they were disappointed that something they had worked for for years was not going to happen.\"\n\nThe team may have walked away from the World Cup without a win, but they were able to help the community following the typhoon, says its media manager. (Rugby World Cup - World Rugby)\n\nRees said there have been several weather and typhoon warnings throughout the tournament, but Sunday's was the biggest.\n\nThe team is flying back to Vancouver. Its members will rejoin their professional rugby clubs.\n\n\"And recovering a little bit, to be perfectly honest,\" he said.", "description": "Canada had to leave the Rugby World Cup tournament in Kamaishi, Japan, without a win Sunday, after their last game was cancelled\u00a0due to Typhoon Hagibis.
