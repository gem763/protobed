You also know that John Durham who is a prosecutor here, a senior justice department official, he\u2019s pursuing his own investigations on the origins of that probe. Are you concerned that Barr\u2019s or Durham\u2019s investigation will find wrongdoing and seek to punish former intelligence officials?\n\nJames Clapper: Well, I uh, I don\u2019t know. I, I, I don\u2019t think there was any wrongdoing. I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly charged situation. I know, for my part, my main concern was the Russians, and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric. The message I\u2019m getting from all this is, apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh, by the way, blown off what the then commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could that we had available to us \u2014 and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration. And while we\u2019re at it, declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public, and that\u2019s what we did.\n\nJim Sciutto: One issue I\u2019m \u2014 (crosstalk)\n\nJames Clapper: It\u2019s kind of disconcerting now to be investigated for, you know having done our duty and done what we were told to do by the president.\n\n\"What Obama told us to do\u2026.\" pic.twitter.com/KEKHTx40j3 \u2014 Rep. Steven Smith \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepStevenSmith) October 8, 2019\n\nClapper makes these statements in such a deadpan voice, we don\u2019t realize at first the gravity of his words. But this is the first time a deep state insider has connected Obama to this travesty.\n\nRush Limbaugh was over the moon as he read this transcript to his listeners on Monday. He said:\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for this. A lot of people have been waiting for this. Here\u2019s Clapper saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong! We didn\u2019t do anything wrong, \u2019cause we were doing what Obama told us to do.\u201d The question he was asked is (summarized), \u201cAre you worried about this investigation that Barr and he\u2019s team\u2019s running against you? Are you worried? You, Clapper and Brennan, are you guys worried?\u201d (muttering) \u201cOh, no. Of course not. Why? (muttering) The president told us to do all that! (muttering) Obama was the president of the United States. Uhhh, the chief executive, uh, commander-in-chief told us to do all that.\u201d Really? Folks, can you say in any other time and place \u201cbombshell\u201d?\n\nIn a text message dated September 2, 2016, from former FBI lawyer Lisa Page to fired FBI official Peter Strzok, she wrote: \u201cpotus wants to know everything we\u2019re doing.\u201d The two were putting together a list of talking points for then-FBI Director James Comey who was scheduled to meet with Obama.\n\nI suppose we\u2019ve just heard Clapper\u2019s defense. I was just following orders.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that\u2019s what the Nazi\u2019s said at the Nuremberg trials.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that wherever Obama is right now, he\u2019s not too happy!", "description": "BIG: James Clapper Admits He Was Following Orders From His  \u2018Commander-In-Chief, President Obama\u2019", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Sarah Lee", "Brad Slager", "Mike Ford", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/james-clapper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
