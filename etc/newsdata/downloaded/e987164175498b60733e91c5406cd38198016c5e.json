That's when we'll be judged if we're a great front three or not.'", "description": "Raheem Sterling has hailed England's burgeoning winning mentality and is targeting glory at Euro 2020.\u00a0Gareth Southgate 's side can qualify for the competition\u00a0on Friday.", "authors": ["Press Association Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19561406-0-image-a-51_1570744960390.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
