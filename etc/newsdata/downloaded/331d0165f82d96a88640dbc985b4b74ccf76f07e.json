Adam Schiff\u2019s claim it was no longer necessary.\n\n\u201cNO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\n\nIn an interview on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Schiff said testimony from the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d was no longer needed.\n\n\u201cOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\u201d Schiff said, warning testimony from the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d might expose his identity.\n\nRepublicans have expressed concerns Trump remains unable to face his accuser, who continues to remain anonymous.\n\nTrump questioned whether the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d was instructed by Schiff to file a complaint.\n\n\u201cWe must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nHe again noted Schiff publicly lied about his phone call with Ukraine during a Congressional hearing, making it sound worse than it actually was.\n\nTrump concluded:\n\nDemocrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript, and when Ukrainian President and the Foreign Minister said there was NO PRESSURE, very normal talk! A total Impeachment Scam!\n\nAdam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.. \u2014 Donald J.
