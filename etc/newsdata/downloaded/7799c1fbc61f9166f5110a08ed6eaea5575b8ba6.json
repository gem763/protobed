REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nU.S. Attorney General William Barr and Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said they were negotiating an agreement that would enable police to get faster access to electronic evidence in the other country.\n\nU.S. officials are also working on a similar agreement with the European Commission, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe agreement comes as Barr and Trump have been pressing other governments to help out with a review of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies\u2019 actions as they investigated Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for possible ties to Russia.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he agreed to help out Barr with the inquiry when Trump called him in August.\n\nThe Justice Department did not say whether Barr and Dutton discussed the review. A spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump and his allies charge, without evidence, that the investigation was a politically motivated attempt to hurt his political prospects.\n\nDemocrats and some former U.S. officials involved in the effort say the review is an attempt to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings that Trump\u2019s campaign welcomed Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election on his behalf.\n\nMueller\u2019s probe led to criminal convictions for several former Trump aides, but he ultimately concluded that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal conspiracy charges.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation was triggered in part when a top Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer, was allegedly told by Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nDetails of the conversation, which Papadopoulos denies, were passed to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Papadopoulos was later prosecuted by Mueller\u2019s office and pled guilty to lying to the FBI.\n\nBarr travelled to Italy in September to discuss the probe with intelligence officials there, according to a source close to the matter.\n\nItalian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that Barr was focused on the actions of Joseph Misfud, a Maltese university professor who, according to Mueller\u2019s report, had contacts with Russian intelligence officials and told Papadopoulos about the compromising emails.", "description": "The United States and Australia said on Monday they would work to bolster law-enforcement ties as the two countries are separately cooperating on a politically charged probe examining whether U.S. officials overstepped when they investigated Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Andy Sullivan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438154238&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961FM", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
