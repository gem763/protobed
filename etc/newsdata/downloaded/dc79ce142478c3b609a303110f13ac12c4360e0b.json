The Pro Bowl tailback didn\u2019t practice all week as he recovers from an ankle injury.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful, but we\u2019ll see how he feels on Sunday. \u2026 We talked about it last week. He tried to go, tried to tough it out and wasn\u2019t himself and didn\u2019t feel good. We want to make sure he feels like himself and 100 percent before we put him out there.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who has battled through the ankle injury in recent weeks, attempted to play but was limited to three snaps during last week\u2019s game against the New York Giants. Backup running back Chase Edmonds filled in for Johnson and ran for 126 yards and three touchdowns on 27 carries in the team\u2019s 27-21 win over the Giants.\n\nIf Johnson is unable to suit up, Edmonds is expected to receive the bulk of the carries against the Saints. The Cardinals also signed veteran tailbacks Alfred Morris and Zach Zenner on Wednesday to provide additional depth in the backfield.\n\nWide receiver Christian Kirk (ankle) and linebacker Jordan Hicks (calf) were listed as questionable for Sunday\u2019s contest. Both will be game-time decisions, according to Kingsbury.\n\nThe Cardinals will travel to New Orleans on Sunday before hosting the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday Night Football.", "description": "Oct. 25 (UPI) \u2014 Arizona Cardinals star running back David Johnson\u2019s availability for Sunday\u2019s matchup against the New Orleans Saints is", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
