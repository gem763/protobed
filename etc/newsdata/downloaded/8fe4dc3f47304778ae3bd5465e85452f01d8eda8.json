The moves we made over the summer are just a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing over the last 16, 17 months. Within the walls of our locker room and the walls of this building, we feel good about the direction we\u2019re going in and we\u2019re going to continue to get better daily.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers went into rebuilding mode by dealing some veterans at the trade deadline in 2018 and continued it at last season\u2019s deadline. There were a lot of ups and downs in the first full season of the makeover, and they finished 32-36-14. New York had just five wins in its last 21 games (5-10-6) to end up seventh in the eight-team Metropolitan Division, 20 points out of the last wild card in the Eastern Conference.\n\nNow, the team that began training camp with on-ice testing on Friday has even higher expectations than the one that left for the summer five months earlier.\n\n\u201cI want improvement,\u201d Rangers team president John Davidson told reporters one day earlier: \u201cPlayoffs is a goal for sure, but there\u2019s got to be improvement the right way that you can count on long-term to get gratification out of the season.\u201d\n\nQuinn believes the familiarity the returning players have with his system should help their second training camp together get off to a better start than a year ago. And they should be better prepared for their coach\u2019s physical demands.\n\n\u201cThey certainly have done everything we\u2019ve asked them to do away from the rink,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThey look in better shape, they\u2019re a little bit older, a little bit more mature. We just want to continue to build on the progress they made last year.\u201d\n\nSigning Panarin in free agency was a big boost. The 27-year-old had 28 goals and 59 assists last season while helping Columbus get the last wild card in the Eastern Conference and then beat Presidents\u2019 Trophy-winning Tampa Bay to advance to the second round. He brings career totals of 116 goals and 204 assists in 322 games over four seasons with Blue Jackets and Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nKakko was selected with the No. 2 overall pick in this year\u2019s NHL draft, and Trouba was acquired in a trade with Winnipeg and then signed as a restricted free-agent.\n\nDavidson, who rejoined the organization in May after stepping down as the president of the Columbus Blue Jackets, knows Panarin well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s competitive, really competitive,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThe big spots in games, he likes to find a way. \u2026 He\u2019s\u2018 a guy that\u2019s going to show up for work every day and you don\u2019t have to worry about him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very strong, strong on the puck, strong in loose-puck battles.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know as the Rangers head into their first practice sessions on Saturday:\n\nBETWEEN THE PIPES: Henrik Lundqvist back for his 15th season after going 18-23-10, with career-worst of a 3.07 goals-against average and a .907 save-percentage. It also marked the first time he had fewer than 24 wins.\n\nAlexandar Georgiev is coming off a solid season as the backup, going 14-13-4 with a 2.91 GAA. The 23-year-old could be challenged for the No. 2 spot by Igor Shesterkin, the Rangers\u2018 fourth-round pick in the 2014 draft, who has come over from the KHL.\n\nDavidson and Quinn both said they don\u2019t have a target for games in mind for Lundqvist, but don\u2019t want to overuse him.\n\n\u201cWe want him to have a great season so that when we do make the playoffs he\u2019s in a position where he\u2019s fresh,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nLINE COMBINATIONS: Quinn said he plans on starting camp with Pavel Buchnevich joining the first line with Panarin and Mika Zibanejad. Filip Chytil will get a look at centering the second line with Chris Kreider on the left wing and possibly Kakko or fellow rookie Vitali Kravtsov on the other side.\n\nLias Andersson and Brett Howden will get chances in the middle on subsequent lines. Ryan Strome is likely to start out on a wing, but could also see some time at center.\n\nO CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN: The Rangers haven\u2019t had a captain since trading Ryan McDonagh at the deadline in 2018, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be a standout favorite to fill that role.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d like to have a captain but that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to evolve,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation where it\u2019s going to happen and the captain will pick himself in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Vin Cherwoo at www.twitter.com/VinCherwooAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Rangers have two clear goals this season: to keep improving and return to the playoffs after a two-year absence.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vin A.
