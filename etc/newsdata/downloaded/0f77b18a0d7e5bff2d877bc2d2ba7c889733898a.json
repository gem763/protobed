ETH price remained in a bearish zone and even broke the $180 support. Moreover, there was a close below $180 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more downsides and the price broke the key $175 support area. It traded close to the $170 level and a swing low was formed near $171.\n\nAt the moment, the price is consolidating losses above the $172 level. An immediate resistance is near the $175 level. Moreover, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $188 high to $171 low is near the $175 level. Besides, yesterday\u2019s highlighted key bearish trend line is intact with resistance near $175 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nIf there is an upside break above $175, the price could test the $177 resistance area. However, the next key resistance is near the $180 level. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $188 high to $171 low. Additionally, the 100 hourly SMA is also positioned near the $180 level to act as a strong resistance if the price corrects higher in the near term.\n\nOn the downside, the $172 and $170 levels are immediate supports. If there is a downside break below the $170 support, the price could continue to decline. The next stop for the bears could be near the $160 level.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is trading in a bearish zone below the $180 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA. If there is an upside correction, the price is likely to face a strong resistance near the $180 and $185 levels. Therefore, there are high chances of more downsides below $170 in the coming sessions.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is about to move into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is now well below the 50 level, with a flat structure.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $170\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $180", "description": "Ethereum price is under selling pressure versus the US Dollar, similar to bitcoin.
