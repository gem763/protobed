After all, vaping isn\u2019t exactly classified as \u201carms\u201d or anything, right?\n\nHowever, there are some aspect of it worthy of note by Second Amendment advocates and something we definitely need to talk about.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about how this ban is being handled.\n\nThe president isn\u2019t calling on Congress to act. He\u2019s making the call unilaterally by ordering the Food & Drug Administration to yank the authorization for these solutions.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nIf you\u2019re reminded of how bump stocks were banned, there\u2019s a reason for that. When the executive branch of government is given regulatory authority, all it takes is a stroke of the pen for the president to outlaw certain items. Just like he did with bump stocks.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant issue, one that didn\u2019t just start with the Trump administration by any stretch of the imagination. Over the decades, Congress has been handing its regulatory responsibilities over to the executive branch by passing laws giving authority to various departments such as the ATF and FDA. It\u2019s been that way so long no one can really fathom it not working that way.\n\nNone of that even touches on the real issue here, and that\u2019s the lousy political timing.\n\nRecently, vaping has been linked to six deaths throughout the United States. Now, these deaths also appear to be linked to cartridges containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. These deaths haven\u2019t apparently been relegated to states where the sale of such items is legal.\n\nYet the Trump administration\u2019s decision to jump on this is worrying to some in the gun community. After all, how difficult is it to turn this logic against guns?\n\nI can hear it now. \u201cGuns are used in far more deaths than vaping. If you\u2019re going to regulate that so heavily, why are you so apprehensive about a few common-sense gun reforms?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s already happening.\n\nWhat. A. Shock.\n\nLook, I don\u2019t vape and so I don\u2019t get overly concerned about that industry. I\u2019m not even writing this to oppose the \u201cvape ban\u201d necessarily. My personal views on such things aren\u2019t relevant.\n\nBut I will point out that this is a slippery slope, one that is already being turned to use against guns and gun rights. It will continue to be used as such, all because President Trump decided that now was the time to make a statement.\n\nWell, precedence has been laid. Even if Trump decided tomorrow to stop this kind of thing, the groundwork has begun. Now, someone else will use this to regulate away gun rights with a signature. Why else does Kamala Harris think she can regulate guns out of existence with Executive Orders? Why does Elizabeth Warren want to do the same to the oil industry?\n\nThe answer is simple. They\u2019ve seen what Trump did and think they can do the same.\n\nRealistically, they\u2019re talking about going much, much further than the president did, to be fair, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t push the boundaries. A ban on vaping products won\u2019t silence this brand of stupidity, it will only embolden it.\n\nAnd the Second Amendment will feel the pain.", "description": "As President Donald Trump moves to ban certain vaping products from the market, there are stark parallels between this and Second Amendment infringements.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
