He will have a four-day crash-course before Saturday\u2019s final against the Springboks and, as one of two No 9s, will start on the bench.\n\n\u2018He\u2019ll have a shirt that fits him, so that\u2019s one significant difference, and he hasn\u2019t been whitebait fishing, so that\u2019s another!\u2019 said Jones. \u2018It\u2019s a great opportunity for the kid. He\u2019s excited about it.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s been in and around the squad for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players. He is a fit guy and he\u2019s keen to rip in straight away. That\u2019s what you want. We always said to those guys outside the 31 that they need to be ready \u2014 and he is ready to go.\u2019\n\nEddie Jones chuckled on Monday as he greeted Spencer to England\u2019s team hotel\n\nStephen Donald (right) got the late call for New Zealand and helped them win the World Cup\n\nSpencer was set to play in the Premiership for Saracens when he got the call over the weekend. The 27-year-old only has three caps but Danny Care, England\u2019s most experienced back-up, lost his place before suffering an injury.\n\nIt is a cruel blow for Heinz, who has offered to remain in Japan to help the team prepare.\n\n\u2018Willi wanted to stay and we wanted him to stay,\u2019 said Jones. \u2018It\u2019s like when you want to get married \u2014 if the lady wants to marry you and you offer to marry, then it\u2019s a pretty easy conversation.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough for Willi. He was in tears in the dressing room but he\u2019s now collected himself and he\u2019s got another role to play. He\u2019s already started mentoring Ben.\u2019\n\nSpencer will play second fiddle to Ben Youngs, with England preparing to face one of the world\u2019s best in Faf de Klerk. Both players have faced him in the Premiership, where he plays for Sale, but now the stakes are significantly higher.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a busy nine,\u2019 said Youngs. \u2018He likes confrontation, getting in your face in defence. A huge amount goes through him in terms of his kicking game, so he\u2019ll be pretty pivotal to how South Africa play.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had a good few practices over the last few weeks against Will Genia and Aaron Smith and the weekend will be no different with the opportunity to play against Faf. It\u2019s one we\u2019re all relishing.\u2019", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: Eddie Jones chuckled on Monday as he greeted Ben Spencer to England's team hotel with a pat on the back and an arm around the shoulder.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/20/20297358-0-image-a-6_1572295799656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
