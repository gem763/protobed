Photo: Giovanni Rufino/ABC\n\nThe puzzle-box show has had an underwhelming run in the last decade. After Lost defined a high watermark for the genre, it inspired a boom of series that failed with either loud bangs or soft whimpers: FlashForward, Revolution, The Event, Threshold, Invasion, Surface, the list goes on. But the showrunners of ABC\u2019s new drama Emergence have learned from those examples, and are taking a swing at making a big science-fiction mystery series on network TV.\n\nEmergence is a show that initially feels familiar: Allison Tolman plays Jo Evans, a cop who discovers a mysterious young girl named Piper (Alexa Swinton) in the wreckage of a bizarre plane crash. A few episodes after the pilot, though, Jo learns that the girl isn\u2019t really a girl \u2014 she\u2019s an artificial intelligence, made for unknown, presumably nefarious purposes.\n\nCo-creators Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters, the producing partnership behind the CW\u2019s Reaper and ABC\u2019s Agent Carter, talked with me about what they\u2019ve learned about mystery-box shows by making Emergence. One of the lessons of previous shows, they explained, is that they shouldn\u2019t be afraid of telling the story, or providing the answers to the mysteries. \u201cI don\u2019t get nervous answering questions,\u201d Fazekas said. \u201cBecause I always trust that Tara and I and our writers\u2019 room can come up with more cool shit.\u201d\n\nWhat made you want to take on a show like this?\n\nMichele Fazekas: So, this is how we decide on what our next project is going to be. We\u2019re cribbing from a process the Disney Imagineers do. They have this really cool way of promoting creativity within groups of people and generating ideas. It\u2019s only marginally like what they do, but we sat down and thought about what movies we loved, what TV shows we loved, what topics we want to talk about. Then you say, \u201cWhat do these things have in common?\u201d We both loved ET, Close Encounters, Children of Men, Blade Runner, how real people deal with magic in the world.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a challenging type of show, right? Many sci-fi mystery shows have not worked as well as they could have.\n\nFazekas: If it\u2019s a mystery show that\u2019s not done well, you just end up frustrating your audience. You can feel it when they\u2019re just delaying something or stretching something out. I was a big fan of Heroes, that first season on NBC, but it fell into that trap a little bit. So how we approached this show was, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have answers.\u201d The other thing is that Tara and I love combining genres. We did it on Agent Carter \u2014 it can be dramatic, it can be funny, it can be sci-fi all together. We liked the idea of combining a genre mystery-thriller show with a family.\n\nTara Butters: And the question was, how do you do something different with a family genre? So the idea that Piper is AI, was like \u2014\n\nFazekas: \u2014 it was almost like raising a special-needs kid.\n\nButters: Yeah! To have the drama still happen within the family.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been thinking about problems that shows like Emergence have faced \u2014 too much delay, making it too much about chasing answers. But those choices then raise their own particular challenges. How do you structure the show to balance the family element with the mystery element?\n\nButters: That balance is one of the hardest things about the show. You have the mystery storyline, which is your serialized thread, and you need to keep having answers and then changing what the question is. At the end of episode three, you find out what Piper is, but then the question becomes, \u201cWhat is she for?\u201d\n\nFazekas: When we pitched the show, we cited a bunch of mistakes people make when making shows like this. First of all, we know the answers. We pitched like three seasons of answers \u2014 and then at the end of the third season, you get launched into a whole other story. But it\u2019s also really important to not just make it about turning over those cards. Even at the end of episode three where you learn that this is, somehow, an AI kid. What does that mean?\n\nI\u2019d read this study about AI. They gave people little AI robots, and the robot would talk and ask you questions, and they told people to turn the robot off at night. Partway through the study, the robot starts to say, \u201cPlease don\u2019t turn me off because I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t wake up.\u201d Half the people in the study listened to the robot! Here\u2019s what I love about that: We are already treating machines like they have feelings and self-determination and rights. So when you have a machine who looks like Piper, you\u2019re not going to just throw it in the trash.\n\nThat\u2019s the core of what you want the show to be, right? It\u2019s actually about parenting an AI kid. But there\u2019s almost none of that in the first episode or the promo materials. Was it hard to decide when to reveal that idea?\n\nFazekas: You have to start at a baseline. What we love about the Spielberg influence is that it\u2019s regular people who something extraordinary happens to. Before you even get into breaking the mystery, it\u2019s really important to be like, \u201cWho are these people?\u201d These are people who I would want to hang out with and watch stories about, without the mystery, because I just find them interesting. I love Jo as a character. I love how Allison plays Jo. But we did want to tell a story about, \u201cHere are normal people. This extraordinary thing happens. How do they react?\u201d\n\nButters: It\u2019s so polarizing in our [writers\u2019] room as we\u2019re talking about what to do with Piper. You had to give the audience and Jo a couple of episodes of bonding with her, so that when you throw in this really huge idea, you understand why [Jo] still keeps her. The amount of people who\u2019ve said, \u201cNo, no, I would hand her over,\u201d it was really interesting. We had to have some believability that they\u2019d have a connection.\n\nWhat are some of the other big pitfalls of making a show like this?\n\nButters: A lot of shows, even procedural dramas, will say, \u201cWe want to go home with the cop.\u201d But those stories have a really hard time competing on an interest level, and end up getting cut 90 percent of the time. By having Piper in the house with our family, even though we\u2019re telling stories about about a divorced couple or a sick father, she informs on those stories. I\u2019m as interested in those stories as I am in the greater mystery.\n\nFazekas: You can\u2019t have these siloed-off worlds where you think you\u2019re going to be jumping back and forth, because one thing is going to potentially feel more interesting than the other. Or it\u2019s going to be, \u201cWhy are we talking about normal stuff when there\u2019s a giant conspiracy afoot?\u201d Having connections between the worlds is super helpful. Having answers. Not being afraid to give answers. I don\u2019t get nervous answering questions, because I always trust that Tara and I and our writers\u2019 room can always come up with more cool shit.\n\nButters: That being said, when we pitched this, we did say that each season should not be more than 13 episodes.\n\nFazekas: It\u2019s not a 22-episode show. On a network-TV schedule, you start your writers\u2019 room and six weeks later you\u2019re shooting! You have no time, and we\u2019re going to be chasing our tails until the end.\n\nButters: That\u2019s one of the biggest challenges for us, the network schedule.\n\nWhat are the biggest debates in the writers\u2019 room?\n\nFazekas: The \u201cwould you keep Piper?\u201d debate is really interesting. People are like, \u201cI would never have that in my house, get rid of it.\u201d And some people are like, \u201cThere would be something ethically wrong with just killing it.\u201d I love that debate.\n\nDo you feel like you have a responsibility to the audience to provide answers quickly? In the past, similar shows have had baggage about whether the audience will feel satisfied.\n\nFazekas: Are you asking if we feel like we have a responsibility to wrap up the story if we\u2019re canceled?\n\nYeah.\n\nFazekas: I don\u2019t. I think that\u2019s a creativity killer. You have to operate like you\u2019re gonna tell plenty of stories. Of course I don\u2019t want to leave people hanging, but I don\u2019t have control over that.\n\nButters: Our very first show was Reaper for the CW. We left season two on a cliffhanger because we were still hoping for a season three. We did not get one. We later gave an interview and basically said what was going to happen in season three because fans wanted to know. But it was the right thing to do, to leave it on the cliffhanger.\n\nFazekas: I don\u2019t think it does anyone any good to hedge your bets. Like, \u201cMaybe we\u2019re going to get cancelled, so let\u2019s wrap up the story just in case.\u201d There\u2019s no point to that.\n\nWhat lessons have other shows taught you? Either shows you\u2019ve watched or shows you\u2019ve worked on?\n\nFazekas: Tara and I met on The X-Files \u2014 we were assistants there \u2014 and that was a great education into building stories. [X-Files creator] Chris Carter used to bring me in to type up rewrites for him. He would dictate them to me; he\u2019d be lying on his couch and I\u2019d just type them into his laptop. He would explain to me why he was doing something. He said that everybody has to be smart, even bad guys. It\u2019s a cheat to make the good guys smarter than the bad guys. That was a really good lesson. The other one is making sure you understand at any given point what your character\u2019s point of view is. A really big thing on The X-Files was, \u201cWhere is Scully coming from at this point? Where is Mulder coming from?\u201d It needs to be really clear and it needs to be logical.\n\nYou cannot make your characters be a slave to plot. The plot has to come from the characters. You can\u2019t say, \u201cI want this to happen, so I want my character to act in this way.\u201d You\u2019re gonna get screwed by that. Tom Schnauz is a writer we\u2019ve hired before who we love \u2014 he came out of the Breaking Bad camp and Better Call Saul, and they have this method that they call \u201cbrick by brick.\u201d You look at the character and think, \u201cwhere is this character now, and what would the next thing be that they\u2019d probably do?\u201d It seems so simple, but people forget that.\n\nThis is a show that\u2019s created by women, and also led by women onscreen, which is unusual on TV generally and especially for this genre. Is that something you\u2019re aware of? Is it something you try to ignore?\n\nButters: We\u2019re very aware of it.\n\nFazekas: We did do Agent Carter, which was similar.\n\nButters: It\u2019s more the sci-fi. You know, female lead [or] male lead, I don\u2019t really care. But females looking at AI, if you look at most of the stories that are about AI, it\u2019s very exploitative. It\u2019s very much where humans are the monsters.\n\nFazekas: We\u2019re basically creating something to murder or rape it.\n\nButters: When we started talking about looking at AI differently, and how we actually think people will end up treating AI, we put our feelings onto it. That\u2019s why making Piper 10 years old, putting her in this family, that\u2019s a very different point of view. Not that a man couldn\u2019t come up with a similar story, but I do think it is infused from a female perspective.", "description": "Emergence co-creators Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters discuss what they\u2019ve learned about puzzle-box shows by making Emergence \u2014\u00a0and why they\u2019re not afraid to give the audience answers to their mysteries.", "authors": ["Kathryn Vanarendonk"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-emergence.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
