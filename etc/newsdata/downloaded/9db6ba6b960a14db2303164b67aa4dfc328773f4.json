Through August, there were 1,009 U.S. CEO departures in 2019, according to Challenger, more than at the same point in 2008 when the economy was embroiled in the financial crisis.\n\nExperts says there has been a shift to more accountability because of worries about the slowing economic expansion, which has been the longest in U.S. history.\n\n\"CEOs are now being held on a shorter leash,\" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. \"When the puffery and the rhetoric doesn't match reality, the boards are under pressure to hold the CEOs accountable.\"\n\n2008 was the second-highest year for CEO turnover with 992 executives leaving through August, 2% lower that the current year-to-date performance.\n\n\"With growing uncertainty surrounding global business and market strength, the fact that so many companies are choosing this moment to find new leadership is no coincidence,\" said Andrew Challenger, Vice President of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a release.\n\nAmidst talks about going public, WeWork's CEO Adam Neumann announced Tuesday he was stepping down from the coworking rental space company after an uproar over governance.\n\nControversial e-cigarette company Juul said Wednesday its CEO Kevin Burns resigned, and will be replaced by former Altria executive K.C. Crosthwaite. Hours later, eBay said its president and CEO Devin Wenig is leaving as the company moves forward with potential sale of assets.\n\nVolkswagen, Nissan and Comscore all lost their chief executives this month.", "description": "CEO turnover hit an all-time record high in August and September is looking to be no different.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106144521-15692643626192019-09-13t120436z_1247796284_rc14fb1c8e20_rtrmadp_3_wework-ipo.jpg?v=1569417957", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
