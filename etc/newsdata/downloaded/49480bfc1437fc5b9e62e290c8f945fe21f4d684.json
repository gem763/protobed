Police suspect he may have killed others", "language": "en", "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. - In blue jeans and a black town of Perinton hoodie, Larry Timmons, a bespectacled and grandfatherly man with a paunch, cut an unthreatening figure as a town parks watchman.\n\nWhat few people who encountered Timmons when he worked for Perinton in 2014, or in his years prior as a real estate salesman around Rochester, could know was that police in his native Missouri suspected him in several killings whose investigations had long gone cold.\n\nOn Friday, police there charged Timmons, 65, who now resides in that state, for the 1988 murder of Cynthia Smith, a 31-year-old woman whose slaying he was questioned in at the time.\n\n'Sometimes cases get better with time': Here's how one yellow sock helped solve a 28-year-old cold case murder\n\nInvestigators there said police in neighboring Oklahoma, where Timmons lived for several years, had reopened investigations into at least two homicides, namely the 1994 murder of Timmons\u2019 first wife, Deborah Jean Timmons, and the 1998 drowning death of an 11-year-old girl who was friends with a daughter Timmons had with Deborah Jean.\n\n\u201cWe call him an opportunist,\u201d said Sgt. Melissa Phillips, of the Lawrence County Sheriff\u2019s Office in southwest Missouri. \u201cHe does not target on sex or age. He has little boys in his past. He has little girls in his past. He has women in his past.\u201d\n\nLawrence G. Timmons More\n\nLocally, law enforcement officials received word earlier this year about the suspicions of Timmons' involvement in unsolved homicides, and have been investigating his time here.\n\nThe Monroe County Sheriff's Office has no unsolved homicides that Timmons would be a suspect in, and also does not have unsolved rapes in which he would be a likely suspect, said Sheriff's Office Investigator Mike Shannon.\n\nIf people have information about Timmons that they think would be of interest to law enforcement, Shannon asked that they call the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.\n\nFrom his early 20s through his early 40s, a period that spanned 1976 to 1994, Lawrence Gene Timmons was linked to no less than five separate violent crimes in Missouri, despite spending seven of those years in prison or on parole.\n\nCold case: 35 years after man's shotgun murder, police arrest his wife\n\nHe was charged in the kidnapping and assault of a young boy, the home invasion robbery of a female college student, and the gunpoint rape of a woman, and was questioned but never arrested in the homicides of his first wife and Smith.\n\nTimmons was acquitted of the rape charge at trial, had his robbery conviction overturned on appeal, and was sentenced to seven years in prison for kidnapping and assault, although he served just three years before getting paroled.\n\nThen, as a single father on the cusp of middle age, his run-ins with the law abruptly stopped.\n\nHe met a woman named Mechele Lokar, a single mother from Perinton whose stint in the Army had landed her in Oklahoma, where Timmons had settled. They had a daughter, married, and eventually relocated to her hometown in 2006.\n\nOnce in western New York, Timmons reinvented himself. He became Larry Timmons, an everyday real estate salesman and, for a brief time, a shuttle driver for senior citizens and a parks watchman for the town of Perinton.\n\nPerinton officials say they plan to review his employment with human resources officials Monday before commenting further.\n\nTimmons lived in two different Perinton locations, said Sheriff's Office Investigator Shannon. Shannon said he sent information about Timmons to police across the state through an internal network but has not heard from any law enforcement considering him a suspect in an unsolved crime.\n\n\"We sent a flyer out to everybody in the state essentially,\" Shannon said Saturday.\n\nMarty Lasher, who was a Perinton neighbor of Timmons, remembered going to Timmons' home once for a cookout.", "description": "Lawrence Gene 'Larry' Timmons was charged Friday with the 1988 slaying of a 31-year-old Missouri woman.
