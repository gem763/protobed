We had hoped that it would usher in a new era, that married together the best of what everyone enjoyed from the first two games and inspired a new series of more ambitious expansions. That\u2019s not quite how things turned out though, as while a new era for Destiny has now begun that change is due to a split from publisher Activision, that has left developer Bungie in charge of the entire franchise.\n\nMost fans seem to have accepted this as a positive move but at the end of the day the only thing that matters is the quality of the game and how it continues to evolve. Bungie complained that Activision forced them to push out expansions and sequels before they were ready and have instead promised to continue a five-year plan for Destiny 2 that will rule out Destiny 3 for now and see the base game go free-to-play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut although free version Destiny 2: New Light is a very generous package it doesn\u2019t include everything ever released for the game and there\u2019s still some things you\u2019ll have to pay for, most obviously Forsaken and this new expansion. Which is unfortunate because Shadowkeep is not a particularly exciting expansion and repeats all the usual problems of the pre-Forsaken ones. Which suggests that Destiny\u2019s wavering fortunes are not something that can be blamed solely on Activision.\n\nAlthough they tend to come in two sizes, large and small, all Destiny expansions are essentially the same in terms of offering a new story-based mini-campaign, on top of new strikes, raids, and Crucible content. One of the best things about Forsaken was that it had a story you could actually care about, with a straightforward premise and interesting side characters. Shadowkeep immediately drops the ball on that count, focusing on Eris Morn who, as usual in Destiny campaigns, is talked about as if she\u2019s incredibly powerful but is reduced to the status of ineffectual bumbler just so that you can be the star of the story.\n\nThe campaign starts off on the Moon, and while the open world patrol zone (which is also included in New Light) is larger than it used to be it\u2019s still essentially the same as in Destiny 1 but with a bit of an extension. The story revolves around a new type of enemy called Nightmares which \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 are just palette-swapped versions of existing enemies. Or in this just the same old grunts and boss characters with a bit of red smoke around them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plot never amounts to anything very interesting and while the game treats one reveal as a stunning revelation it\u2019s still essentially just a teaser and the latest in a long (long) line of promises that things will be more interesting next time.\n\nOf course, the rightly praised combat of Destiny 2 is still enormously entertaining \u2013 with the game still having arguably the best gunplay of any title this generation \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing new in Shadowkeep that seeks to expand or grow it beyond anything you can get for free in the base game. That\u2019s especially true given New Light includes the new Armor 2.0 system, which is a welcome addition that makes armour mods vitally important and feels more like a traditional role-playing game than anything else in Destiny.\n\nShadowkeep also includes two new strikes (also available via New Light), three new Crucible PvP maps (two of which are remakes of older ones), and a new raid that went live shortly after launch. It\u2019s called Garden of Salvation and, predictably, is also set somewhere you\u2019ve already been before, in this case the Black Garden on Mars from the first game.\n\nDestiny 2: Shadowkeep \u2013 same old, same old\n\nThere\u2019s also a new dungeon, meant to be similar to Forsaken\u2019s Shattered Throne, due out on 29 October, so there\u2019s still plenty more content to come, especially when you consider Bungie has four season passes planned (not to be confused with the new Fortnite style battle pass). The first season pass, Season of the Undying, is included free with Shadowkeep but the others you\u2019ll have to pay for separately unless you get the deluxe edition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBungie blamed Destiny 2\u2019s microtransaction controversies on Activision, but four season passes is so much you wonder why they don\u2019t just go all in and have a standard monthly subscription like a traditional MMO. But for now, in terms of value for money, the Shadowkeep story campaign lasts around four hours and everything else can be repeated and replayed in slightly different ways ad infinitum, as is the Destiny way.\n\nThe repetition has always been Destiny\u2019s greatest appeal and greatest failing, but it\u2019s got to the point now where the cooks at Bungie have reheated the same basic content so many times that any excitement over the original dish has begun to fade. Like many, we assumed that Shadowkeep and New Light would be a major milestone for the series, the point at which it finally moved forward \u2013 or at least gave a clear indication of how change would happen in the future.\n\nBut Shadowkeep doesn\u2019t do any of that. It\u2019s just the same old expansion formula as usual, where the entire concept of anything being \u2018new\u2019 is stretched so thin it loses all meaning. But whatever existential concerns Shadowkeep raises about the future of Destiny 2 the bottom line is that it\u2019s not as good as Forsaken and while we don\u2019t resent our time spent with it, it certainly hasn\u2019t reinvigorated our enthusiasm for the franchise. It\u2019s just made us think that maybe it will never change.\n\nDestiny 2: Shadowkeep In Short: A disappointingly backwards-looking expansion that rather than signal a new era for Destiny and Bungie is just more of the same empty teases and recycled content. Pros: The combat is still best in class and the graphics are great, especially the spooky new Moon environments. Armor 2.0 is a good idea and there is plenty of things to do, with more to come. Cons: Short, unsatisfying campaign that fails to do or say anything new. No new races, no new planets, and too much nostalgia. The amount of reused content is becoming absurd.
