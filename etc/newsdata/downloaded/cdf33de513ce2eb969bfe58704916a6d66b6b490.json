It was the hotel which kept us up to date,\" he said.\n\nMr Shapps, who earlier attended an emergency Cobra government meeting on the government's response, said: \"People will experience delays, we're not running the original airline, but we intend to get this done all in the next two weeks and then end this phase of the rescue.\"\n\nHe also stressed people should not come home early from their holidays but should \"carry on and leave on the date they were supposed to leave, having first checked the Thomas Cook website before leaving for the airport\".\n\nThomas Cook, whose roots go back to 1841, went into liquidation after last-ditch talks to raise fresh funding failed. It has left 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, 9,000 of them in the UK.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is coordinating the repatriation - which is the biggest in peacetime - in an undertaking called Operation Matterhorn. It has chartered 45 jets to bring customers home and will fly 64 routes on Monday, from locations including Central America and Turkey.\n\nSome 16,000 holidaymakers were booked to come back on Monday, and authorities hope to get at least 14,000 of them back to the UK.\n\nOperators including easyJet and Virgin have supplied some aircraft, with jets coming from as far afield as Malaysia.\n\nAll Thomas Cook holidays are now cancelled, but some customers complain they have not been given enough information.\n\nAll customer can seek compensation via the government's Atol scheme, or from their credit card or insurance companies.\n\nCustomers seeking information can visit the CAA's special Thomas Cook website. Those scheduled to return to the UK within the next 48 hours or who are having problems with their accommodation or need special assistance can ring 0300 303 2800 in the UK or +44 1753 330 330 from abroad.\n\nImage copyright Leanne Jones\n\nDisneyland dreams dashed\n\nLeanne Jones, a mother of two small boys, has found out that the Thomas Cook vouchers she's been given as presents by her family towards a holiday are worthless.\n\n\"I'm feeling rubbish. Every birthday and Christmas over the last two years I've been saving Thomas Cook vouchers to take my two young children on their first holiday abroad - Disneyland was the plan.\n\n\"I've got \u00a3800 worth and was planning to fly out next summer. I stand to lose all the money from the vouchers and my children will no longer get their holiday.\"\n\nMs Jones, who lives in Milton Keynes, has been in contact with Atol, but says the vouchers are not covered by its protection scheme. \"There is nothing anyone can do to help.\n\n\"That's it, I'm going to have to start saving again. I have no other option. We'll have to wait another two years for our next holiday.\"\n\nIt was her dad's idea that the family give holiday vouchers, and he's now feeling a little guilty, she says. \"It's not his fault at all. It was a good idea at the time.\"\n\nRead more from Thomas Cook customers.\n\nHow will holidaymakers get home?\n\nWhile an estimated 150,000 Britons are affected by Thomas Cook's collapse, the company has up to a further 450,000 customers abroad, some of whom have been affected.\n\nIn Germany, one of Thomas Cook's main markets, insurance companies will help organise the response to its collapse.\n\nUK customers will be brought home \"as close as possible\" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said.\n\nImage caption Thomas Cook planes have been impounded at Manchester Airport\n\nCustomers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to be posted on a dedicated website as soon as they are available.\n\nThe DfT added that a \"small number\" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs.\n\nThe CAA is also contacting hotels accommodating Thomas Cook customers, who have booked as part of a package, to tell them that the cost of their accommodation will be covered by the government's Air Travel Trust Fund and Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).\n\nTim Johnson, policy director of the CAA, told BBC News that customers whose future holidays had been cancelled would be informed of how they can claim a refund on the website.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Travel expert Simon Calder on the collapse of \"the mightiest brand in travel\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom has said she will write to the Insolvency Service urging them to \"fast-track\" their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook's going into liquidation.\n\nThe investigation will also consider the conduct of top directors, who have been paid a combined \u00a320m in salaries and bonuses since 2014.\n\nA Cabinet spokesman said: \"People will rightly look at the size of bonuses to some of the directors and have serious concerns about that.\n\n\"There's a broader issue at play about collapsing firms and director pay and we are looking that more broadly as a government.\"\n\nGETTY Thomas Cook in numbers 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide\n\n9,000 jobs at risk in the UK\n\n150,000 British holidaymakers to be repatriated\n\n450,000 customers affected internationally\n\n34 planesowned (Airbus A321 and A330) Source: Thomas Cook\n\nWhat is the government doing?\n\nThomas Cook asked the government for a \u00a3250m bailout, the BBC understands, but this was denied. Mr Shapps defended the move on the BBC's Today programme.\n\n\"I fear it would have kept them afloat for a very short period of time and then we would have been back in the position of needing to repatriate people in any case,\" he said.\n\nThe company's large debts and High Street-focused business made it a poor candidate for survival, he said.\n\nOverall, Operation Matterhorn will cost the taxpayer around \u00a3100m, he added.\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the government should have bailed out Thomas Cook, \"if only to stabilise the situation while a real plan for the future of the company could be addressed\".\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to help stranded holidaymakers, but also questioned whether company directors were properly motivated to \"sort such matters out\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Passengers are facing queues and disruption, from destinations such as Majorca\n\nWhat happens to staff?\n\nSchapps said a task force would be set up to help the 9,000 UK employees who stand to lose their jobs.\n\nWorkers at some Thomas Cook shops in Britain have already met with representatives of the firm's administrators, who told them they would be made redundant.\n\nJobs at the tour operator's airline and in its engineering division may also go.\n\nSome workers are being kept on, however, but there is no definite number.\n\nThomas Cook shops across the UK are not due to open on Monday.\n\nWhat about Thomas Cook's international operations?\n\nFor now, Thomas Cook's Indian, Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries will continue to trade as normal.\n\nThis is because, from a legal standpoint, they are considered separate to the UK parent company and are not under the jurisdiction of the UK's Official Receiver.\n\nThey do, however, share services - such as aircraft and IT - with their parent company and will need to strike rescue deals in the coming weeks to keep trading.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nThomas Cook had secured a \u00a3900m rescue deal led by its largest shareholder Chinese firm Fosun in August, but a recent demand from its banks to raise a further \u00a3200m in contingency funding had put the deal in doubt.\n\nFosun said in a statement: \"We extend our deepest sympathy to all those affected by this outcome.\"\n\nThe holiday company spent all of Sunday in talks with lenders trying to secure the additional funding and salvage the deal, but to no avail.\n\nThomas Cook has blamed a series of issues for its problems, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News from Manchester airport, travel expert Simon Calder said Thomas Cook \"wasn't ready for the 21st Century\".\n\n\"Now everybody can pretend they are a travel agent. They've got access to all the airline seats, hotel beds, car rentals in the world and they can put things together themselves.\n\nMr Calder, travel editor at The Independent, added that planes at the airport began to be impounded shortly after 00:00 BST.\n\nWhile the company was closing shops to try and cut costs, closing 21 in March, it still had more than 500 outlets, bringing large costs compared to online competitors.\n\nIn another sign of its slow progress in mending its finances, it only stopped dividend payments to investors in November.\n\nWhat are your rights?\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nIf you are on a package holiday, you are covered by the Atol scheme.\n\nThe scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment.\n\nAtol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating.\n\nIf you have a holiday booked in the future, you will also be refunded by the scheme.\n\nIf you have booked a flight-only deal, you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund.\n\nWhen Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.\n\nHere is more information on Atol protection and your rights.\n\nAre you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff?
