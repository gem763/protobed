No guy wants to go through the day worrying if he\u2019s emitting BO, or that he can\u2019t lift his arms without revealing serious pit stains. To find out what products are most effective at controlling sweat and odor, we reached out to three dermatologists, two personal trainers and three men\u2019s grooming experts. Since choosing a deodorant is such a personal decision, and everyone has different body chemistry, it\u2019s hard to proclaim one specific deodorant the \u201cbest overall.\u201d So instead, we broke everything down into categories to highlight the full range of our experts\u2019 picks.\n\nBefore we get into all of that, it\u2019s important to clarify what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about deodorant. \u201cDeodorants technically only mask or neutralize the body odor caused by bacteria, whereas an antiperspirant temporarily suppresses the flow of sweat,\u201d says Jennifer Chwalek of Union Square Laser Dermato\u00adlogy. As she explains, the metallic salts in antiperspirants \u2014 typically aluminum compounds \u2014 \u201ccreate a plug in the sweat duct reducing the flow of sweat.\u201d So one type makes you smell good, and the other stops you from sweating. For that reason, Jeremy Fenton of the Schweiger Dermatology Group and Samer Jaber of Washington Square Dermatology agree that the gold standard for sweat and odor protection is a combination antiperspirant deodorant.\n\nAnother quick point of clarification: You\u2019ve also probably heard a lot about \u201caluminum-free\u201d deodorant or \u201cnatural\u201d deodorant. The two terms essentially mean the same thing, says Jaber. \u201cNatural deodorants are aluminum-free products,\u201d he explains. \u201cAluminum salts are the only FDA-approved chemical antiperspirant.\u201d Aluminum can be irritating to sensitive skin, so if you\u2019re prone to rashes or itchiness, you might want to opt for a deodorant-only product that kills odor-causing bacteria. Fenton suggested ingredients like \u201czinc, witch hazel, or essential oils that have antibacterial properties, such as lemongrass, sage, and tea tree, or baking soda, which neutralizes odor.\u201d Whatever you\u2019re looking for, we\u2019ve got you \u2014 or your pits \u2014 covered. Here are the experts\u2019 picks for all levels of stinky and sweaty.\n\nBest men\u2019s antiperspirants for very heavy sweaters\n\nCertain Dri Prescription Strength Clinical Antiperspirant Roll-On Certain Dri is Fenton\u2019s favorite brand for excessive sweating. \u201cOne of the keys when you\u2019re using it is to apply at night. You want the aluminum to settle down in the sweat glands,\u201d he says, which is harder to do during the day when you\u2019re actively producing sweat. Because it\u2019s so strong, Fenton recommends starting slowly \u2014 every other night at first \u2014 to avoid irritation. \u201cThere\u2019s a cumulative effect as it settles into the pores,\u201d he says, so using it every 48 to 72 hours may be all you need. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nSweatBlock Antiperspirant \u2014 Clinical Strength Chwalek recommends this powerful antiperspirant, which you wipe on once a week. Endorsed by the International Hyperhidrosis Society, one SweatBlock wipe can be effective for up to seven days. Like Certain Dri, SweatBlock is supposed to be applied at night. But if leaving the house in the morning without applying anything feels strange to you, Fenton says you can use a non-antiperspirant deodorant in the morning for added odor protection. Strat writer Carlo Dellaverson, a self-proclaimed \u201ccard-carrying member of the excessive-sweating community,\u201d says SweatBlock wipes \u201chave taken on a sort of cult status among excessive sweaters, for when nothing else works.\u201d $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest men\u2019s antiperspirant deodorant for moderate to heavy sweaters\n\nMitchum Advanced Control, Clean Control $3 (was $5, now 40% off) For guys who don\u2019t need the most powerful antiperspirant, or who find it irritating to their skin, Fenton says Mitchum is \u201cone step down\u201d in intensity from the strongest stuff, and very effective for controlling wetness and odor. $3 at Amazon Buy $3 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest men\u2019s antiperspirant deodorant for sensitive skin\n\nDove Men+Care Antiperspirant Deodorant Stick, Extra Fresh (Pack of 2) $8 (was $10, now 20% off) Fenton, Chwalek and Jaber all like Dove antiperspirant. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need superstrong stuff, a lot of guys like the scent of Dove\u2019s men\u2019s skin-care line,\u201d says Fenton. Aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex, the active ingredient in Dove, is less irritating on the skin than some of the harsher chemicals. We have of course written about a wide range of skin-care issues here at the Strategist, and Dove always seems to be a dermatologist favorite, especially for sensitive skin. (The brand tends to keep things simple and offers many fragrance-free options, since chemical fragrance and even essential oils can be irritating to some people.) For an even gentler option, Jaber recommends the sensitive-skin Dove antiperspirant that he personally uses. It\u2019s fragrance-free and alcohol-free, and it contains moisturizing ingredients. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nVanicream Anti-Perspirant Deodorant $8 (was $10, now 20% off) If you have particularly sensitive skin but still need a strong antiperspirant, Jaber recommends Vanicream. It has a high concentration of aluminum to prevent sweating, but it\u2019s free of all fragrances, dyes, lanolin, parabens, and pretty much any other potentially irritating ingredients. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nBan Roll-On Antiperspirant Deodorant, Unscented (4-Pack) $16 (was $18, now 11% off) Ban is another company known for making gentle, fragrance-free products. Celebrity groomer Ronnie Peterson loves Ban\u2019s roll-on antiperspirant and told us that he\u2019s \u201cbeen using it for the past eight years.\u201d Peterson uses the fragrance-free version, but there are lightly scented options, too. The liquid \u201croll-on\u201d style dispenses a thin layer of clear liquid, which means it absorbs quickly and won\u2019t leave that white residue some deodorants do. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest men\u2019s antiperspirant deodorant for working out\n\nGillette Cool Wave Endurance Clear Gel Antiperspirant Deodorant (2-Pack) $8 (was $9, now 11% off) Master personal trainer Joey Levy of Corefit 101 is loyal to this gel-based antiperspirant. \u201cIt goes on clear and absorbs well,\u201d he says, and it does not leave any \u201cembarrassing wet underarm spots.\u201d It also \u201csmells great, and the scent stays strong all day,\u201d says Levy. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to stay dry and smell good even after a hard workout.\u201d $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest natural deodorants for men\n\nUrsa Major Hoppin' Fresh Deodorant If any type of aluminum antiperspirant irritates your skin, or if sweat isn\u2019t a big problem for you, it may be time to try a deodorant-only product. Just be ready. Chwalek says, \u201cIf you do switch from an antiperspirant to a natural deodorant, you may feel extra wet at first, as they really don\u2019t reduce sweat.\u201d But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be effective,\u201d says Chad Beightol, the owner of men\u2019s grooming boutique Consigliere who has been using non-antiperspirant deodorant for several years. As he explains, a good deodorant employs natural ingredients that \u201cfight the bacteria that cause odor.\u201d Beightol told us that, after trying out a bunch of deodorants, this is the one that really works for him. \u201cI swear by it,\u201d he says. The deodorant contains hops, which, \u201cwhile great at making beer, are also effective at fighting bacteria and microbes,\u201d he says. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nAgent Nateur Holi N3 Natural Organic Deodorant Groomer and makeup artist Robert Reyes likes this natural deodorant because it\u2019s \u201clong lasting, absorbs quickly, and never leaves residue transfer on clothes,\u201d he says. He likes the \u201cclean scent\u201d with notes of honey, lavender, and eucalyptus. $21 at Amazon Buy $21 at Amazon Buy\n\nArt of Sport Clear Stick Aluminum-Free Deodorant, Rise Scent If you\u2019re worried that natural deodorant won\u2019t quite cut it when it comes to sweaty activities like working out, you\u2019re probably right. But not this one, according to certified personal trainer Ariel Brill. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my daily workout deodorants,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all-natural and made for athletes. And it feels soothing on the skin.\u201d Even though it\u2019s not an antiperspirant, Brill doesn\u2019t see a big difference in how much he sweats between using this and his antiperspirant. Active ingredients include matcha and arrowroot powder, and he likes the \u201cRise\u201d scent, which contains cedar and vanilla. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nJason Tea Tree Oil Deodorant Stick $13 (was $23, now 43% off) Fenton likes Jason\u2019s line of natural deodorants and recommends their tea-tree-oil deodorant if you\u2019re looking for a lightly scented option with bacteria-fighting tea-tree oil. If you have very sensitive skin, Fenton suggests using Jason\u2019s unscented option instead. \u201cEven the deodorants without antiperspirant can be irritating,\u201d he says. You\u2019ll need to go through some trial and error to find the natural ingredients that don\u2019t bother you. $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
