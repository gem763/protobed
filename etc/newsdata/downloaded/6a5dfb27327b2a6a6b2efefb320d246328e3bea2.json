Municipalities pay well if you are a councillor or even if you are an official. Small business people there have no other place but to do business with the municipality. So when you have a situation like that, it creates problems and it encourages corruption or fighting to death,\" said Dlamini-Zuma.\n\n\"That's why councillors die, they get killed,\" she added, stressing that there was no excuse for corruption.\n\nTurning to the district development model which President Cyril Ramaphosa recently endorsed, she said one plan would allow all stakeholders to know what was happening at all times.\n\nThe one district model aims to have one integrated plan per district. It will also allocate different roles for the government, communities and civil society.\n\n\"Because everybody knows what is supposed to be done, everybody knows what budget is supposed to be there. If we see the budget of the bridge disappearing but the bridge not appearing, we will know,\" said Dlamini-Zuma.\n\n\"When somebody is not implementing, there will be peer review,\" she added.", "description": "Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma says room for corruption will lessen in local government when processes become more transparent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8606/a99c05e14cea4b759dd73ec7e25fdfeb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
