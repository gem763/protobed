It\u2019s actually helped many clients absorb Wilson\u2019s lessons about controlling spending, budgeting and not getting carried away with credit cards.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t see me as a perfect person and I don\u2019t want them to,\u201d said Wilson, 24, who never wants to be indebted again after paying off her remaining balance of approximately $5,000.\n\nWilson doesn\u2019t make her finances her main talking point, but it sure does help. \u201cIt just helps build that trust and relationship a lot sooner.\u201d\n\n\u2018I went a little overboard\u2019\n\nWhen Wilson started college in 2012, her mom let her stay in her house\u2019s finished, 800-square foot basement. Wilson didn\u2019t have to pay rent or tuition, but her mom wanted to teach a lesson about self-sufficiency. So Wilson had to pay for just about everything else, including food, gas, clothing, toiletries and furniture.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be a problem, Wilson figured. She had a $12-dollar-per-hour part-time job first processing medical bills and then car loans. Earning $1,200 a month, Wilson bought cabinets, a couch, a dining-room table, a mattress, chairs, a television, and a laptop. She also painted the basement. \u201cI wanted it to look really nice,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nWilson bought lunch on campus and decked out her wardrobe, using her Amazon AMZN, -0.27% credit card, an American Express AXP, -0.48% card and store cards from places like Kohl\u2019s KSS, +2.63% and Old Navy GAP, -2.65%. \u201cI went a little overboard for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever I wanted, I would buy,\u201d she said.\n\nWilson, a finance major, graduated from Georgia State University in 2016 with $12,000 in credit-card debt. College taught her how to analyze stocks and bonds, but not how to budget, she said. The school offered a personal-finance class, which she now wishes she took. \u201cI think every single person should have to take a class like that. It\u2019s one of those lifelong skills they really should be teaching.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Treasury Department recommends \u2018mandatory\u2019 financial-literacy courses for college students\n\nWilson graduated and moved out of the basement to her own apartment. She got a job as an administrative assistant at a financial planner\u2019s office. She took out a $12,000 loan with a 13% interest rate from Upstart, an online lender, in order to pay off the credit-card debt. Wilson\u2019s store cards all had interest rates upwards of 25%, she noted.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell her mother about the loan \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want her to know how bad it was.\u201d\n\nWith just one loan to pay down, Wilson \u201cenjoyed life a little.\u201d She used her credit card to buy clothes for the office and drinks and meals with friends. She took on another $4,000 in credit card debt.\n\n\u201cIt took me a couple months to realize, \u2018Oh, the credit cards are creeping up again.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018There was a lot of shame\u2019\n\nMonths after graduating school, Wilson picked up her first book on budgeting.\n\nShe also asked for another loan \u2014 this time from her mother, Sharon. \u201cThere was a lot of shame around that and feeling I let her down.\u201d\n\nThe conversation went better than expected. Sharon loaned her daughter around $4,000 with zero interest \u2014 but she made it clear this was a one-time deal. Wilson paid at least $100 a month and paid even more when she could. She now owes her mom less than $500 and she owes around $5,000 on the Upstart loan.\n\nWilson said her mother \u201chelped me stay accountable. It actually turned out be a good thing that she knew.\u201d\n\n$75 weekly grocery bills\n\nBy the winter of 2018, Wilson and her now-husband, Mike, got serious about tackling the debt.\n\nThey overhauled their grocery expenses and stopped eating out. They now buy their meat once a month at Sam\u2019s Club WMT, -0.69%, freeze it and use it throughout the month. The weekly grocery bill can be as small as $75, but can climb to $200 when buying diapers and formula for their infant daughter.\n\nWilson doesn\u2019t buy any new clothes until she sells last season\u2019s items on the online secondhand shop thredUP or the local consignment store.\n\nShe also uses Calendar Budget, an app that lets her see her household\u2019s cash flow and allows her to adjust expenses accordingly.\n\nA fresh start for Wilson, and her clients\n\nAround the time Wilson started hacking away at the debt, she also started her job at SmartPath, a personalized financial-coaching service. The Atlanta-based company doesn\u2019t sell financial products or manage investments, but it helps clients determine their way to goals like retirement or extinguishing student-loan debt.\n\nIn her first couple months on the job, Wilson didn\u2019t mention her back story as clients discussed their struggles. \u201cIt was hard for a while. I did feel ashamed because I thought clients would want to talk to someone who already had their finances in order,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then I tried it and the results have been incredible.\u201d\n\nClients start talking candidly about their situation after they hear Wilson\u2019s tale. Now she often discusses her own grocery-shopping tips with clients. \u201cIf a client is spending more than they make, it typically boils down to food spending,\u201d she noted.\n\nSee also: This financial adviser shed 100 pounds, and $60,000 in debt and back taxes \u2014 here\u2019s how he did it\n\nRyan McPherson, director of coaching at SmartPath, said it was \u201cabsolutely wonderful\u201d Wilson talked with clients about her personal money-related problems. \u201cWhen you hear a financial coach or financial adviser who claims to never have any struggles of their own, beware.\u201d\n\nPart of Wilson\u2019s skill was her capacity to connect, McPherson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got be able to relate to your clients in order to help them.\u201d\n\nWilson said she\u2019s come to grips with the fact she can\u2019t trust herself with an unlimited access to credit. The couple now has two credit cards, and they both watch their statements closely.\n\n\u201cI just had to set that boundary for myself. I think that helped dramatically.\u201d", "description": "\u2018They don\u2019t see me as a perfect person and I don\u2019t want them to.\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS728_alex_w_ZG_20191004164905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
