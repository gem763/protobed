'We know that this is temporary. We\u2019re only going to be able to play professional soccer for five to six more years. We\u2019ve got to take advantage of this, and know that when we\u2019re done playing, we\u2019re going to be together.'", "description": "US Women's Soccer star Alex Morgan has announced that she is pregnant with her first child.
