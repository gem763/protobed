Hero Images/Getty Images\n\nIf some of the problems begin at home, so do many of the solutions. First, as parents, we should have the same conversations about money with our daughters and our sons, emphasizing for each the importance of spending, saving, and investing for the long-term.\n\nWe should also treat our children as individuals and be aware that even in the same household, different kids may need different guidance. One important way to do this is to help our daughters understand the unique challenges they may face as women.\n\nFor instance, even before your daughter enters the workforce, have an honest conversation about the wage gap and other potential inequalities. Encourage her to advocate for herself and feel confident negotiating terms and salary. Discuss the importance of women taking control of their finances, especially around retirement.\n\nOf course, young men have their challenges as well. The way to truly level the playing field is to do our best to guide all the young people in our lives to make smart money choices. Living below your means, getting started early on retirement savings, realizing the power of long-term investing to grow wealth \u2014 all of these concepts are the building blocks of a secure financial future for everyone.", "description": "Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz\u00a0is president of the Charles Schwab Foundation.
