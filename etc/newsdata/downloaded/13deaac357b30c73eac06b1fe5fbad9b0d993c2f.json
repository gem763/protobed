Getting \u2018kinky\u2019 too soon\n\nGetting 'kinky' too really early on freaks most people out. There\u2019s plenty of time to explore more adventurous sex later on (stock image)\n\nSure, if they\u2019re also into what you\u2019re into, they\u2019re going to love it, rather than be turned off.\n\nBut introducing some pretty \u2018out there\u2019 sex moves really early on freaks most people out.\n\nYour first thought is this: If they\u2019re needing this much stimulation at the beginning - when pretty basic sex feels great because you\u2019ve just met - what are they doing to want to do when we\u2019re two years in and bored?\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of time to explore more adventurous sex later on. Why waste the erotic punch of trying new things at the start, when it\u2019s not really needed?\n\nMore importantly, one person\u2019s kink is another person\u2019s \u2018yuk\u2019.\n\nOnce you stray off the conventional path, you\u2019re moving into unknown territory.\n\nYou don\u2019t know this person\u2019s sexual history or how conservative they might be deep down. Both strongly affect how adventurous they want to be.\n\nI\u2019m not saying stick to missionary, but I am saying take baby steps when suggesting something out of the norm.\n\nProposing you have anal sex or some pretty full-on BDSM in the first few sex sessions is way too soon for most people.\n\nLooking disappointed over penis size or performance\n\nThe quickest way to guarantee you will never see a guy again is to either look visibly disappointed with how well-endowed he is or over-react to any issues he has with erections or ejaculating too quickly.\n\nImagine him removing your bra, looking at your breasts and sighing dejectedly.\n\nYou\u2019d want to put your clothes back on and get out of there!\n\nSex expert Tracey Cox (pictured) shares her advice for a successful love life\n\nYet this is how some women react to penises that don\u2019t conform to their expectations.\n\nIf he really likes you, most men are nervous the first time they have sex and penises don\u2019t like it when their owners aren\u2019t relaxed.\n\nIf his biggest fear is not getting an erection, losing it or getting so excited it\u2019s all over in seconds, anxiety ensures any or all of the above will happen.\n\nIf something does go wrong, be kind.\n\nReassure him it\u2019s not an issue and nothing to be concerned about.\n\nWe are rarely more vulnerable than the first few times someone has sex with us.\n\n2. Over acting in bed\n\nLying back and letting him do all the work always makes it onto the \u2018Things I hate in bed\u2019 list for men.\n\nBut doing the opposite - screaming the place down when all he\u2019s doing is tweaking a nipple - isn\u2019t too far below it.\n\nLetting him know you\u2019re enjoying what he\u2019s doing is one thing.\n\nOver playing it and pretending every single thing he does is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you, just comes across as, well, desperate to please.\n\nLetting him do all the work always makes it onto the \u2018Things I hate in bed\u2019 list for men but doing the opposite isn\u2019t too far below it (stock image)\n\nActing like a porn star won\u2019t win him over.\n\nYou think \u2018All men love porn so that\u2019s how they want me to behave in bed\u2019 but the truth is, any sane human being over the age of 18 knows porn is make believe and nothing like how the average person behaves.\n\nShow enthusiasm but don\u2019t overdo it.\n\n3. Not returning the favour with oral sex\n\nYou don\u2019t have to immediately reciprocate but the \u2018effort\u2019 scales should even up over a few sessions.\n\nIf he\u2019s spent a good half an hour giving you oral sex each of the six times you\u2019ve slept together and you haven\u2019t offered to do it to him once, the message is clear.\n\nYou\u2019re here to please me. The fact that I\u2019m letting you do something to me should be enough.\n\nInitiating oral sex, without either of you having to hopefully push the other\u2019s head in that direction, shows you\u2019re willing to give and receive pleasure and tells them you\u2019re not squeamish about bodily fluids.\n\nMOVES THAT WILL KEEP THEM COMING BACK FOR MORE\n\nSo, if they\u2019re the four things that will guarantee you WON\u2019T get another date, what can you do to make certain you will.\n\nStart by\u2026\n\nTaking it slowly\n\nCasual sex has its place but, for most of us, sex with someone we like and want to have a relationship with is a big deal.\n\nTake your time getting there.\n\nFirst up, it prevents \u2018lust blindness\u2019: ending up in a relationship with someone you\u2019re sexually attracted to but actually don\u2019t like very much.\n\nTaking your time is important as it prevents \u2018lust blindness\u2019: ending up in a relationship with someone you\u2019re sexually attracted to but actually don\u2019t like very much\n\nOnce we start having sex, we don\u2019t stop having sex and sex releases powerful hormones which make us bond with someone we don\u2019t know very well.\n\nSecondly, why rush into having full, penetrative sex? If you stay with this person, you\u2019ll be doing that for life.\n\nTease it out for as long as you possibly can. It makes it one hell of a lot sexier and stamps \u2018special\u2019 onto it.\n\nListen, we all know couples who do it on the first night and end up married, blissfully, for life.\n\nBut finishing that first date with a kiss that hints of things to come, keeps you both in that \u2018Do they fancy me as much as I do them?\u2019 torturous state that feeds desire.\n\nOver the first few weeks (or months if you really want to take it slowly), move from passionate kissing onto some light foreplay sessions; then oral sex for one or both after that.\n\nSaving penetrative sex for a big moment \u2013 when it really means something - makes it an event.\n\nIt also keeps the sexual tension at boiling point for a lot longer.\n\nHaving one, hot move that makes you stand out from the rest\n\nMost of us have one killer bedroom move: something we do that\u2019s worked well on people in the past.\n\nIt might be giving the best massage they\u2019ve ever had \u2013 using your entire body.\n\nIt might be removing your clothes with the finesse of a professional stripper.\n\nIt might be as simple as the swirl or a tongue or a long, tortuous tease as you tell them exactly what you\u2019re about to do, as you do it.\n\nI\u2019m all for keeping it simple at the start but pulling out your \u2018signature\u2019 move a few sex sessions in, will definitely keep them coming back for more.\n\nDon\u2019t have a personal piece de resistance?\n\nIf you\u2019re friendly with an ex, ask them what they thought you were great at.\n\nThe trick is to focus on whatever sex act you enjoy the most, then try out a few different techniques before deciding on one to concentrate on.\n\nOnce you do, research it until you find something usual to try, then practise.\n\nLet your gut instinct guide you when trying it out on your lover. If you\u2019re doing something you love doing, you\u2019re usually good at it so don\u2019t be too nervous.\n\nAdding a flourish or something unexpected is impressive and shows you\u2019re enthusiastic about sex and open to exploring new things.\n\nAdmiring their body\n\nEven if you\u2019re buff, toned and visit the gym twice daily, being told you have a great body is a huge confidence boost.\n\nEven better: being told your private parts are pretty hot as well.\n\nTelling a woman she tastes amazing or saying, \u2018Wow! Is that for me?\u2019 to a guy is going to make them feel great \u2013 and like you more for it.\n\nAdmire your partner's body is important and the happier you are being naked, being touched, looked at and admired naked, the better\n\nThe absolute worst thing to do the first time you have sex with someone is to not have a good look at what\u2019s revealed and/or not make any comment at all about what you\u2019re seeing, feeling or experiencing.\n\nNo comment feels like rejection.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of bodies\u2026the happier you are being naked, being touched, looked at and admired naked, the better.\n\nBody image issues kill lust because if you\u2019re self-conscious, you\u2019re not in the moment and good sex is all about being able to lose yourself in the moment.\n\nLetting them know you like them and like having sex with them\n\nLike, duh, this is a given, right?\n\nYou\u2019d think so \u2013 but you\u2019d be amazed how many people play their cards close to their chest, thinking that\u2019s how you keep someone interested.\n\nThe reality is, being over-eager is better than being too cool \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve had a handful of dates or meetings.\n\nFine if you want to play a bit hard to get at the very start. But seriously, if you\u2019re still doing it six dates in, you\u2019re simply sending confusing signals.\n\nIf you\u2019re starting to like someone the more you see them, you want to know that feeling is returned so you won\u2019t end up hurt.\n\nBe brave: let them know you like them if you do.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to launch into a flowery speech, just look them straight in the eye and say, \u201cI missed you. I was so excited to see you today\u201d.\n\nIf the sex is as hot as hell and you can\u2019t stop thinking about it, tell them.\n\nThere is no better way to guarantee another date than to tell someone they\u2019re the best lover you\u2019ve ever had!\n\nListen to The Tracey Cox Show on Jack Radio, Wednesday\u2019s live from 12-1pm.
