Years to have relationships, careers, mistakes and successes.\n\nSince April 2019, 13 children have been killed by gun violence in the city of St Louis, Missouri. The oldest among them were just 16, the youngest was Kayden Johnson, a two-year-old baby.\n\nWhy are so many black children being shot dead in one US city? Read more\n\nIn St Louis, the life expectancy of the average adult is 74.1 years (based on data from 2008 to 2016 published by Missouri\u2019s department of health). If you assume that these children reached that average life expectancy had they not been killed by guns, they would have together had an extra 818 years between them. But averages are more complicated than that. In a city as deprived of resources as St Louis, even your zip code matters \u2013 in some parts of the city, the life expectancy is as low as 69 years.\n\nIf those children had been born outside of St Louis, they could have expected longer lives. Nationally, the life expectancy of people born today in the US is 78.6 years. But none of these children were white \u2013 a fact which also cuts short the lives of millions of people in the US. Black children born today are expected to live almost four years less than their white peers.", "description": "13 children have been killed by gun violence since April 2019 in the Missouri city, where average adult life expectancy is 74.1 years", "authors": ["Mona Chalabi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0ab6039293870759512c46b1ddc1bc216fed43/0_1374_6373_3825/master/6373.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a27fa9fa633e7f3c1729bf3aab2a170", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
