She claims Copperman would examine her 'head to toe' on every visit, including rubbing her genitals and inserting ungloved fingers into her vagina\n\nSome patients recalled Copperman forcing them to lie on their backs in the exam room because he told them they were 'dirty' and needed a 'genital clean'.\n\nMany claim that he was so revered by parents as an upstanding man that they never questioned him when he said he wanted to examine their children alone without them being present.\n\nDina Ribaudo, now 43, claims Copperman started sexually abusing her with she was eight years old.\n\nShe claims Copperman would examine her 'head to toe' on every visit, including rubbing her genitals and inserting ungloved fingers into her vagina.\n\n'I could go there for a paper cut and he would have touched my vagina,' she said.\n\nSeveral women who lodged complaints in the 90s testified during a hearing before the medical board in 2000.\n\nTwo of those women said they had orgasms while Cooperman was performing what he claimed was genital cleaning.\n\nSome of the sex abuse complaints from Copperman's alleged victims date back to the 1980s. Pictured above is a decades-old magazine article about the allegations Copperman faced\n\nAt the time, Copperman defended his actions saying he had always prided himself on being 'thorough'.\n\n'I have always tried to live my life in such a way that if someone said something bad about me, no one would believe it,' he said.\n\nThe panel, who described him as being morally unfit to practice medicine, revoked his license in December 2000.\n\n'Rubbing the female genitalia during a physical examination is always inappropriate, whether or not gloves are used,' the panel said at the time.\n\nAn additional 19 women came forward with allegations of sex abuse after hearing Copperman's medical license had been revoked in 2000.\n\nDespite his license being revoked, Copperman did not face any charges and never had to register as a sex offender.\n\nThe Nassau County District Attorney's office has since said they wanted to pursue charges but were unable to due to restrictive laws at the time and the statute of limitations.", "description": "Stuart Copperman, now 84, has been accused of abusing dozens of female victims while he ran his medical practice in Merrick, Long Island for 35 years.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19500000-0-image-a-23_1570637101063.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
