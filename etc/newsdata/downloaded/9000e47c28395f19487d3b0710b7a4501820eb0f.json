But those brief sections of text held a complex story about a young Black girl trying to navigate identity, privilege and history in her hometown of Portland, Oregon, that my adult self found wholly relatable.\n\nSome of the most popular books currently on bookstands are intended for younger readers. There are so many graphic novels, chapter books, picture books and poetry collections written just for kids, all of which teach them important lessons on life that grown-ups will get a kick out of too. While at 28 years old, I\u2019m devouring these titles, sadly the intended audience is barely nibbling on the rich literature available to them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still giving kids novels with characters who don\u2019t look like them, who don\u2019t talk like them and who don\u2019t even have internet access and we wonder why they don't like reading.\u201d\n\nRecent studies show that reading for fun drops drastically for kids between the ages of 8 and 9. According to a Scholastic 2018 reading survey, 57 percent of 8-year-olds say they read for fun; that number drops to 35 percent by the time children are 9. The same downward trend exists for kids who say they love reading; while 40 percent of 8-year-olds said they do, only 28 percent of 9-year-olds said the same.\n\nA love of reading and storytelling sets kids up for socioeconomic success as they grow through life. But if the numbers are to be believed, as kids advance in age, they tend to fall out of love with reading. And who can blame them, really, when what they\u2019re told to read becomes increasingly dense and outdated as they make their way through school? Common Core standards have long been criticized for taking the fun out of English class, as students are given nonfiction and articles to read since that\u2019s the type of content they\u2019ll encounter in college. Just before this school year began, Florida\u2019s Department of Education unveiled their student reading list for Kindergarten through 12th grade. With few exceptions, most of the books on the list were published between 1800 and 1950 and featured mostly white characters penned by mostly white male authors.\n\nWestern literary classics (as determined by old white men) and \u201cscholarly\u201d articles have long been the standard for school-aged children. The classics, of course, still have value, but they shouldn\u2019t be the only literary adventures children are given access to in their formative years. We shouldn\u2019t be determining important literature based on what centuries-old scholars tell us is important, but rather on what inspires kids to keep reading and learning. Yet we\u2019re still giving kids novels with characters who don\u2019t look like them, who don\u2019t talk like them and who don\u2019t even have internet access \u2014 and they\u2019re told to understand what\u2019s happening and pass a test on it later. And we wonder why they don\u2019t enjoy reading.\n\n\u201cPut some respect on modern children's, teen and YA books. Within their pages lies the secret to navigating the space between childhood and adulthood.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there are entire genres of books dedicated to the unique modern-day experiences, imaginations and problems of young people. YA books and kid lit give children access to the world as it is now and also to the world as it should be: diverse in race, gender and religion, technologically advanced and rich in cultural references and dialogue. And through audiobooks and ebooks, kids have more ways to access these treasure troves if only we encourage them to do so. These modern classic books give a voice to today\u2019s generation and they can teach us adults a lesson or two about where we can make necessary shifts in our value systems.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not so weird that I still read kids books. Maybe more grown-ups should see the value in modern books created just for today\u2019s children and teens. As it is National Book Month, it\u2019s as good a time as any to put some respect on the children\u2019s, teen and YA sections of your local library or bookstore. Within those pages lies the secret to navigating the space between childhood and adulthood.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some children\u2019s and teen books to add to your kid\u2019s library, check out some of my favorites:\n\n\u201c Piecing Me Together \u201d by Renee Watson (ages 12 and up)\n\nThis book got my reading year off to a great start.
