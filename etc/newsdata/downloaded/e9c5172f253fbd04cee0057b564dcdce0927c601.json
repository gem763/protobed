Alas, \u201cUnhinged\u201d feels a little like treading water \u2014 like, really uninteresting water. For better or worse, This Is Us is usually great at presenting a throughline that connects an episode\u2019s storylines, regardless of where they fall on the Pearson Timeline of Destiny. There are a few storylines that somewhat connect in this episode, but too many of them feel like they came from a grab bag of plots. I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re slowly building to something and these storylines will mean a whole lot more in the future, but this is too slow and I\u2019m bored!\n\nThere are a couple of bright spots: Siblings being there for each other! It warms my cold, dead heart. Although the siblings I always want to see interacting with one another are the Adult Big Three \u2014 because this show is 3,000 times better when that happens and honestly I should just get that on a T-shirt because I feel like I say it so much\u2014I am very much here for a little Deja and Tess bonding session after a rough first day at school. Deja just found out that Malik has a 6-month-old daughter (good on Malik for getting ahead of that news), which is very complicated for a ninth-grader. Tess is mad at herself for balking on coming out to the kids at her new school as she planned. Deja, Tess, and Annie are the Big Three Next Gen, so I\u2019m open to them finally having some storylines on their own.\n\nTheir bedroom chat also mirrors one the original Big Three have back in 1992: Randall wears Air Jordans to his first day of seventh grade to impress his new teacher, but gets written up for it and proceeds to have a meltdown. He immediately calls home to tell his mom, because Randall\u2019s gotta Randall, but Kevin, whose school hasn\u2019t started yet, answers and decides he\u2019s going to actually be there for his brother this time. For a 12-year-old troublemaker, \u201cbe there\u201d means show up at Randall\u2019s school and sign the demerit slip, which is not on the up-and-up, but the intention is good and also it\u2019s just a uniform infraction. Look at me, siding with a 12-year-old who spends his days off laying around with cucumbers on his eyes!\n\nThat storyline ends with Randall coming to explain his panic attacks to Kevin as they sit on the bedroom floor, and Kate\u2014who has spent the day doing aerobics with her mom because she\u2019s worried Stuart won\u2019t like her since she\u2019s bigger than him\u2014joins them and tells them about her big kiss, and her brothers act appropriately: They tease the hell out of her. And when Randall asks Kevin about Arsenio Hall\u2014Randall\u2019s teacher had mentioned him, his teacher is another potential black male role model for Randall, which is why he\u2019s been trying to impress him\u2014it\u2019s Kevin\u2019s idea to have the whole family watch The Arsenio Hall Show together.\n\nWhy have a nice Little Kevin and Randall bonding moment and not have that reflected in the present-day storyline, I do not know. Instead, Adult Kevin and Randall are both off on their own adventures. Have they even called to check in? They should be constantly texting, okay?\n\nKevin is with Uncle Nicky, attempting to do damage control after Nicky tossed a chair through a window at the V.A. We get a quick visual of Nicky\u2019s journey since Kevin, Randall, Kate, and Rebecca met with him: Kevin\u2019s note of encouragement and insistence that he try a meeting at the local V.A. office works, and after bonding with his therapist there, he starts to get better. He\u2019s landscaping and throwing out trash and looking wistfully at pictures of Baby Jack and, most importantly, not drinking. And then his therapist gets transferred and he completely regresses. Thus, the chair-throwing. If he doesn\u2019t show remorse or agree to continue treatments with the new doctor, he could be facing a big fine or jail time.\n\nSo Kevin takes him to get assessed by the doctor. While he\u2019s in the waiting room, he makes friends with Matty, who you may remember from the premiere\u2014he\u2019s Cassidy\u2019s son. He\u2019s there waiting for Cassidy, also going to therapy. When Cassidy comes out and sees the two of them eating chips and playing video games, she\u2019s mad. Okay, fine, do you want your 9-year-old being friends with a strange adult man? Obviously not, but they were just sitting in the waiting room, hanging out! I love a good dig at Kevin\u2019s age (she asks if he was on Who\u2019s The Boss?), but Cassidy went a little overboard. I know, I know, she\u2019s Dealing With Things, but, like, be nice, lady. You left your kid out there!\n\nEven though Nicky gets approved to continue treatments at the V.A., which hopefully translates to a lesser sentence, he\u2019s not taking it seriously. He leaves his assessment and walks immediately into a bar across the street. Kevin can\u2019t take it anymore! He needs an AA meeting and he\u2019s bringing Nicky with him. Would you look at that? Cassidy\u2019s there, too! And she\u2019s still so mean!\n\nKevin starts talking about how his nephew helps him focus on his sobriety, but then starts rambling about how he thought he\u2019d have more purpose in life by now and that he\u2019s worried he might be living in \u201cJowl City\u201d by 50, and Cassidy breaks out into laughter. Yes, it\u2019s a very silly thing to worry about (except for the guy using cucumber slices at 12), especially in an AA meeting surrounded by vets, but laughing at him like that? I guess Kevin doesn\u2019t mind, because Cassidy, Nicky, and Kevin all begin howling and are asked to leave the meeting. So that Kevin/Cassidy storyline is right on track, people.\n\nRandall, on the other hand, is trapped in a dreadfully boring political storyline. I don\u2019t know anyone who was completely jazzed about all the politics last season, so why are we still here? Sure, it\u2019s very cute that Randall and Jae-won are best friends\u2015they run together and do a lot of fist bumps, so you know it\u2019s true love! And Randall fires an experienced aid who disrespects both Randall and his Chief of Staff, which I guess ties into Jack and Miguel\u2019s story that we\u2019ll get to below, but I feel like their burgeoning friendship and insistence that being idealistic is the only way to make changes in the City of Philadelphia could\u2019ve been mixed into another, more engrossing storyline. Although, I do hope Jae-won\u2019s proposal goes well, backed by an acoustic version of \u201cEverlong\u201d or not.\n\nThis Is The Rest\n\n\u2022 Back in 1992: Jack makes a huge mistake at work and gets fired, until Miguel marches into their boss\u2019s office and tells him that he, the most successful account manager there, is quitting and taking his clients with him, unless Jack gets his job back. It works, and if Jack and Miguel weren\u2019t yet the two best friends anyone could have, they are now.\n\n\u2022 I laughed so hard during Jack and Miguel\u2019s \u201cdid we just become best friends?\u201d phone call when Jack said that he knows they \u201cdon\u2019t say mushy things\u201d to each other. Jack is King of Mushy Things. (I mean, his speeches are said sternly and with a mustache, but still their contents are mushy.) He makes up for lost time, I guess?\n\n\u2022 If I could, I would return every part of Kate\u2019s storyline\u2014she discovers Toby has been going to CrossFit and he\u2019s ripped and she\u2019s ashamed!\u2014except for the part where she meets her surly neighbor, Gregory (Timothy Omundson). When Kate tries to brush him off for complaining about the Damons parking partly on the sidewalk, he lets Kate know she\u2019s not the only person in this town who\u2019s suffered a tragedy. He had a massive stroke over two years ago (as did Omundson, and this part was written specifically for him to return to TV), had to teach himself to walk and talk again, lost his job, and just wants to walk around the block without cars in the way, dammit! By the end, Kate, Baby Jack, and Audio join Gregory on his trip around the block. It\u2019s actually very nice.\n\n\u2022 REBECCA\u2019S WORKOUT ATTIRE, I CANNOT. I know it\u2019s supposed to be 1992, but no.\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou are all radiant women and this town is lucky to have you.\u201d Can I get that line looped and set up as my alarm? Either that one or, \u201cSashay on in here, little cutie.\u201d I just like positive reinforcement when I first wake up, okay?", "description": "Save a couple of sibling-centric bright spots, this episode feels like treading water \u2014 really uninteresting water.
