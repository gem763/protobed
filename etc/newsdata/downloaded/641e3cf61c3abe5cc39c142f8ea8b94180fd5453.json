Will Bond Traders Allow It?", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Heading into the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate decision this week, the consensus is that the central bank will cut its lending benchmark for the third time in as many meetings. But, unlike the past two, there\u2019s belief that Chair Jerome Powell will strongly suggest a timeout on monetary easing this time around.\n\nPerhaps the strongest case for this conviction is the recent moves in the $16 trillion U.S. Treasury market. Two-year yields, at 1.64%, are up almost 30 basis points from earlier this month, while 10-year yields have climbed more than 40 basis points from their lows. The yield curve between those two maturities is the most positively sloped since before the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in July \u2014 a far cry from August\u2019s \u201cdoom and gloom.\u201d Just since Oct. 3, fed funds futures have priced out about one-and-a-half quarter-point rate cuts by the central bank through the end of 2020. A gauge of interest-rate volatility fell last week by the most since early April.\n\nTaken together, the evidence suggests that bond traders are on board with this week marking the end of the central bank\u2019s \u201cmid-cycle adjustment.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\n\nBy now, it should be clear to all Fed watchers that \u201cdata dependency\u201d takes a backseat to bond markets when push comes to shove. The central bank simply doesn\u2019t shock traders with its decisions. That was true in July, it was true in September and it will be true again this month.\n\nThe bond market\u2019s more cheery outlook in recent weeks is effectively summarized by this quote from Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a mood switch to optimism on Brexit, optimism on the trade front,\u201d she said. And for that reason, \u201cthis might be the most opportune time, if the Fed does want to pause, to go ahead and suggest that.\u201d\n\nPowell can \u201csuggest\u201d his view of the path ahead all he wants. But recent history has shown that whatever he says in his post-meeting press conference doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes to the next interest-rate decision. Especially when the reasons for optimism are so fragile and subject to change at any moment.\n\nConsider July\u2019s rate cut. Powell indicated that the committee was thinking of the move as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment to policy\u201d as opposed to \u201cthe beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle.\u201d That mattered for less than 24 hours. President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods, sending investors running to Treasuries and giving the Fed little choice but to further ease policy as the yield curve inverted the most since 2007.\n\nEven September\u2019s meeting provided something of a \u201chawkish cut.\u201d Esther George and Eric Rosengren openly dissented against dropping interest rates, and a total of five Fed officials indicated they disagreed with the move, judging by the \u201cdot plot.\u201d And yet, a few bad readings on the U.S. economy at the start of October sealed this week\u2019s rate cut.\n\nThe dot plot, by the way, illustrates why the Fed feels it needs a break. Policy makers won\u2019t update their forecasts at this meeting, but as it stood last month, not a single official saw the fed funds rate dropping below the range of 1.5% to 1.75% at any point through at least 2022. To reiterate: 41 days ago, when looking three years into the future, not even the most dovish Fed members expected to lower their benchmark beyond where it\u2019ll almost certainly end up this week.\n\nOf course, the constraints of the dot plot have never stopped the Fed before. It\u2019s worth remembering that the median forecast as recently as June was for the fed funds rate to remain in a range of 2.25% to 2.5% through 2019 \u2014 the same level as the start of the year. The projections have been scratched out and revised so frequently over the years that it\u2019s no wonder the bond market\u2019s view is taken as gospel.\n\nAll this is to say, just because traders haven\u2019t fully priced in another interest-rate cut by year-end doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t by the time the Fed\u2019s next decision rolls around on Dec. 11. I\u2019m sure part of the reason they pared back expectations for further easing is because in other instances of mid-cycle adjustments in the 1990s, lowering rates by 75 basis points was enough to get the economy on stable footing. That could very well be the case this time around.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Heading into the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate decision this week, the consensus\u00a0is that the central bank will cut its lending benchmark for the third time in as many meetings.
