The more than 100 refugees forced to disembark Sunday night were baffled about why they were turned away.\n\n\u201cAt the last minute like this, it\u2019s kind of disappointing,\u201d Renard Oliver, who held his infant daughter, told Brian Entin, a reporter for Miami TV station WSVN. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful because I\u2019m watching my daughter cry, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nThe incident, which U.S. Customs and Border Protection blamed on the ferry operator, comes amid bipartisan calls to waive all visa requirements for Bahamas survivors. At a news conference Monday, acting CBP commissioner Mark Morgan said that there was \u201cconfusion\u201d around the issue but that the agency\u2019s policy hadn\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cThis is a humanitarian mission,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIf your life is in jeopardy and you\u2019re in the Bahamas \u2026 you\u2019re going to be allowed to come to the United States, whether you have travel documents or not.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cwe still need to vet you to make sure we\u2019re not letting dangerous people in.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, President Trump told reporters that we \u201chave to be very careful\u201d when letting people from the Bahamas into the United States, saying that \u201ceverybody needs totally proper documentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to allow people that weren\u2019t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States \u2014 including some very bad people and very bad gang members,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump contradicts CBP head on Bahamian refugees, argues they might have been infiltrated by \u2018very bad people\u2019\n\nUnder existing U.S. policy, Bahamians can enter the United States without a visa by providing a passport and proof of no criminal record and going through pre-screening conducted by CBP in Freeport and Nassau.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) responded to Trump\u2019s remarks, saying she was \u201cdeeply disappointed by this display of callous disregard for human suffering.\u201d\n\nDeeply disappointed by this display of callous disregard for human suffering. Our Bahamian neighbors are in the middle of one of the great humanitarian crises of our time. America must be ready & willing to give them shelter. https://t.co/tLIe1F4zin \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) September 9, 2019\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who with Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) wrote an open letter to Trump last week urging him to allow in refugees with relatives in the United States, tweeted that the president\u2019s statement \u201cis not new policy.\u201d He said that he and Scott have asked for \u201csome accommodation from the administration\u201d because some Bahamas survivors may have lost their passports or other identification.\n\n\u201cI understand the narrative the U.S. is denying entry to victims of a storm is attractive. But it\u2019s not accurate,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrent policy is still operative now. Although I would like to see some flexibility.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, in a statement issued Monday evening, said: \u201cThe U.S. Embassy in Nassau is open for emergency visa appointments and CBP Ports of Entry are prepared should Bahamians request to temporarily relocate to the United States.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, a cruise ship called the Grand Celebration took nearly 1,500 refugees to Palm Beach, Fla., without requiring passengers to show U.S. visas, according to media reports.\n\nEntin reported that crew members on the Sunday ferry were told that the same rules were in effect.\n\nCBP said the ferry operator, identified by local reporters as Balearia Caribbean, was at fault for not properly coordinating with government officials.\n\n\u201cCBP was notified of a vessel preparing to embark an unknown number of passengers in Freeport and requested that the operator of the vessel coordinate with U.S. and Bahamian government officials in Nassau before departing The Bahamas,\u201d the agency said in a statement shared with The Washington Post late Sunday.\n\nA CBP official in Florida told WSVN that it was a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d by Balearia to remove the refugees without visas.\n\n\u201cIf those folks did stay on the boat and arrived, we would have processed them, vetted them and worked within our laws and protocols and done what we had to do to facilitate them,\u201d a CBP spokesman said in the interview, adding, \u201cThey were not ordered off the boat by any U.S. government entity.\u201d\n\nBut Balearia Caribbean said it had \u201cthe understanding\u201d that the passengers could go to the United States without visas and only learned otherwise after they had boarded.\n\n\u201cWe boarded these passengers with the understanding that they could travel to the United States without visas, only to later having been [be] advised that in order to travel to Ft. Lauderdale they required prior in-person authorization from the immigration authorities in Nassau,\u201d a Balearia spokesman said in a statement sent to WSVN.\n\nJust interviewed @CBPFlorida when we got off ferry in FL. They say they would have accepted and processed the Bahamians, and blame the ferry company Balearia. CBP says they tried to coordinate with Balearia but company \"made a business decision\" to take the evacuees off the boat. pic.twitter.com/ONkgdcJvS3 \u2014 Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) September 9, 2019\n\nThousands have fled the islands after Dorian tore away roofs, flooded neighborhoods and left tens of thousands of people homeless. Most have gone to Florida, which has close historical ties to the Bahamas.\n\nBut many survivors seeking respite in Freeport on Sunday did not find it. Hundreds struggled to buy tickets on ferries and flights. Eventually, workers at the Freeport Harbour locked the terminal doors after all of the seats on the ferry Sunday evening had been sold. Many people continued to wait outside.\n\nPeople waited in line for hours to buy tickets and board the evening Balearia Caribbean ferry.\n\nBut after the announcement demanding visas, a long line of refugees slowly filed off the boat.\n\n\u201cThis is terrible,\u201d one woman who stayed on the ferry told WSVN as the ferry left the harbor.\n\nAs anger and confusion mounted Sunday, CBP cited the Grand Celebration\u2019s arrival as proof that the United States isn\u2019t blocking refugees from the island.\n\n\u201cCBP continues to process the arrivals of passengers evacuating from the Bahamas according to established policy and procedures \u2014 as demonstrated by the nearly 1,500 Hurricane Dorian survivors who arrived at the Port of Palm Beach, Fla., aboard a cruise ship on Saturday and were processed without incident,\u201d a CBP spokesman said in a statement.\n\nIn that statement, CBP emphasized that Grand Celebration worked with officials in both nations before the voyage.\n\n\u201cThe Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line coordinated their evacuation mission with U.S. and Bahamian government officials before departing The Bahamas, and coordinated with CBP prior to the arrival of the C/S Grand Celebration,\u201d the federal agency said. \u201cAll of the evacuees possessed valid travel documents.\u201d\n\nCBP said Sunday that the U.S. Embassy in Nassau is open for emergency visa appointments. The agency also requested that all refugees present themselves at a U.S. port of entry so that their admission can be reported to Bahamian authorities searching for missing residents in Abaco and Grand Bahama.\n\nThe refugees\u2019 plight comes after Rubio and Scott\u2019s letter and a similar appeal by 18 other Florida lawmakers.\n\nOn Monday, shortly before Morgan\u2019s news conference, Scott urged CBP officials and the Bahamian government to clarify the current visa rules.\n\n\u201cAs hundreds of thousands of Bahamians seek refuge or start to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian, we cannot have the kind of confusion that occurred last night in Freeport,\u201d Scott said in a statement.\n\nIn the Bahamas, tens of thousands are still without homes, electricity or clean water. Mark Green, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, told The Post that it looked as though the islands had been \u201chit by a nuclear bomb.\u201d Bahamian officials warned that the death toll on the islands is likely to rise significantly as authorities continue to survey the destruction.", "description": "The incident, which U.S. Customs and Border Protection blamed on the ferry operator, comes amid bipartisan calls to waive all visa requirements for Bahamas survivors.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter", "Herman Wong", "General Assignment Editor Focusing On Breaking News", "Audience Growth"], "top_image": "https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-09-2019/t_e1eb17cfb9d34dd084e698aac4dd1710_name_IjeYzVcKzhDMzzPs_00_00_50_16_Still004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
