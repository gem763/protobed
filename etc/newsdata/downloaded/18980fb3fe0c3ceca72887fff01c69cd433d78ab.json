On this Labor Day, both sides of the political aisle should be giving credit where credit is due \u2013 to the Trump administration \u2013 for reviving America\u2019s manufacturing sectors and generating a prosperous economy in which wages are rising and unemployment rates are near all-time lows.\n\nBut we hear nothing from the left regarding America\u2019s prosperity and a booming economy. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. Many Democrats in Washington deride the president every day and hope to scare us with unfounded predictions of recession and making demands for policies and government regulations that would return us to the economic flatline of the Obama years.\n\nThe crown jewel in the Democrats\u2019 plan for economic disaster is what\u2019s known as the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d (GND). GND is nothing more than a half-baked concoction of rules and regulations that will essentially destroy our domestic energy industry, idle millions of workers, and cost taxpayers multi-trillions \u2013 all under the guise of addressing climate change. GND is the invention of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and supported by a rising tide of self-described socialists within the Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to Ocasio-Cortez, the GND is essential to fight climate change and save the planet. Who can forget AOC\u2019s dire prediction that we only have a dozen years before the world ends if we don\u2019t stop global warming now? On September, 4, CNN is hosting a televised town hall on climate change in which 10 Democratic presidential candidates are scheduled to participate. Tune to watch which candidates will trip over themselves to embrace the GND as the answer.\n\nThe only realistic aspect of the GND is the calamitous effect it would have on America. The GND bans the entire fossil fuel industry, including clean burning natural gas. The plan eliminates 99 percent of cars, it eliminates air travel, and calls for an \u201cenergy efficient\u201d remodel of many buildings. The GND is actually a master plan for social engineering \u2013 as admitted by AOC\u2019s now former chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, who foolishly explained how the true motivation behind the GND is to overhaul the \u201centire economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you guys think of it as a climate thing?\u201d Because we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing,\u201d Chakrabarti stated in front of a Washington Post reporter.\n\nGND comes complete with its own charter, a list of what government is obligated to supply every citizen, including a job for everyone who wants one, single-payer healthcare, and free housing. According to a Competitive Enterprise Institute study, the GND would cost households in five states more than $70,000 in just the first year and place roughly 90 million small business jobs in jeopardy.\n\nMini versions of the GND have appeared in New York and California. In California, some businesses have started charging additional service fees due to the costly environmental regulations imposed upon them. CEO magazine consistently rates California as last in the nation of states that welcome and embrace new business development.\n\nNew York\u2019s proposed mandate of net-zero emissions by 2050 will likely require solar farms larger than the city of Buffalo. New Yorkers already pay 50 percent more for electricity than the national average. Additional taxes to subsidize government-run solar plants will only add to the citizen tax burden in the state.\n\nPresident Trump is doing all he can to drive additional economic growth and revive American manufacturing. The president\u2019s tax cuts coupled with a decisive move to roll back many job-killing regulations are an unequivocal success. As a result, many Americans are entering the labor force for the first time or re-entering the job market after years of hardship.\n\nLabor Day should serve as a reminder of how America became a manufacturing powerhouse and the leader of the global economy. Socialist plans like the GND or mini-versions of the GND must never be implemented in the United States if we hope to strengthen the economy and generate even more prosperity for working families.\n\nAlfredo Ortiz is President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a non-partisan organization founded by entrepreneurs.\u201d", "description": "Most people view Labor Day as a celebration of the .09/02/2019 3:14:38AM EST.", "authors": ["Alfredo", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/246/de2b10a2-e1b1-4f59-a3c1-b0713b4af21a.jpg"}
