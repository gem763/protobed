Nixon resigned in 1974 surrounding his involvement with covering up an attempted burglary of the Democratic party's Watergate office.\n\nTrump is currently facing an impeachment inquiry after reportedly urging Ukraine and China's political leaders to investigate presidential rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nJohn Oliver's latest edition of \"Last Week Tonight\" tackled President Donald Trump's Ukraine whistleblower complaint.

Trump asking China and Ukraine to do that should really bother us.\"\n\nOliver also criticized GOP leaders who continue to defend Trump.\n\n\"People act on his jokes,\" Oliver argued. \"Russia took his whole 'help find Hillary's emails' routine pretty seriously. And shooting off his mouth now is significantly worse, because, you know, he's the president.\"\n\nHe continued: \"If he was just any old Fox News-addled idiot ranting about how Biden should be investigated, that would be one thing. But he's not. He's the president. He has real power, and when he abuses it to keep himself in power, that's a big problem. ... It has to be illegal, and for good reason. Because unfortunately, not every foreign government will be as brave and willing to stand up to Trump as (expletive) Nickelback.\"\n\nJohn Oliver weighs in on news he missed, from 'stupid' shutdown to Ocasio-Cortez dancing\n\nStephen Colbert thinks Chrissy Teigen's NSFW Twitter lashing for Trump is perfection\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/07/trump-ukraine-saga-should-really-bother-us-john-oliver-says/3896514002/", "description": "Late night host John Oliver compared President Donald Trump to a Fox News-addled idiot in his latest installment of \"Last Week Tonight.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published A.M.
