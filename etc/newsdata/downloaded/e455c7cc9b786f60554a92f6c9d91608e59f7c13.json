She said she\u2019d attempt to deliver the address in the city\u2019s Legislative Council chambers, which were recently repaired after being ransacked by anti-government protesters in July.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you agree that the most important livelihood issue that a chief executive should address would be housing and land supply,\u201d Lam said, adding that she would present a total of 200 new initiatives.\n\nThe chief executive also condemned escalating protester attacks on police officers as the unrest gripping the city grinds into a fifth month. Over the weekend, a police officer was slashed in the neck by a sharp object, protesters lobbed a petrol bomb inside a subway station and an improvised explosive device was set off in Kowloon near a police vehicle.\n\nHer comments also come as U.S. lawmakers consider bipartisan legislation that would establish annual reviews to determine whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to justify continuing its special trading status. On Monday evening, thousands marched peacefully through the city\u2019s financial district waving American flags and calling on the U.S. to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protests began in early June in response to a since-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. They have since expanded to include calls for greater democracy in the former colony.\n\nHong Kong has seen some of its worst violence yet since China\u2019s National Day on Oct. 1, which was followed by Lam\u2019s decision to ban protesters from wearing masks under the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance. That emergency powers law could also potentially be used to detain and arrest protesters and censor publications.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net;Stephen Tan in Hong Kong at ztan39@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Daniel Ten Kate\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pledged measures to address the city\u2019s notorious housing shortage, as she prepared to deliver her annual policy address despite concerns about possible disruption by protesters.Lam held up a copy of the text on Tuesday while previewing the speech in remarks", "authors": ["Iain Marlow", "Stephen Tan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v9zDDwHGtTEmW2znS2ttyA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/cb2c3262e64dbbc94e98216542daa30d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
