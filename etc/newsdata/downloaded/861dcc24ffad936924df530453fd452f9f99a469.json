For her and Cody (32) it made no difference.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t bothered with the possibility of Down syndrome,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe knew we\u2019d love our girls either way.\u201d Even when Charlotte and Annette were born in February 2018 and were both diagnosed with trisomy 21, the most common type of Down syndrome (DS), the couple from Oregon in the USA weren\u2019t fazed.\n\nFrom the moment they clapped eyes on their twins they were hopelessly smitten. Now 18 months old, the girls are bundles of energy.\n\n\u201cLottie [Charlotte] is observant, picking up quickly on communication, whereas Nettie [Annette] leads in physical development, cruising around our living room, and free standing,\u201d says Rachael, who\u2019s a stay-at-home mom.\n\nAnd both children have a talent for stealing hearts around the world. In a bid to change people\u2019s perceptions about DS, Rachael shares her family\u2019s story with the more than 61 000 people who follow her Instagram account, @doublingdownmom.\u201cWe\u2019ve loved every moment with our daughters, and they\u2019re the lights in our lives,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cDown syndrome is nothing to fear and everything to celebrate. \u201cThe only difficult part in parenting children with DS is that the rest of the world has yet to understand the beauty and joy they radiate.\u201d Rachael and Cody feel so strongly about spreading their message of acceptance they even have matching tattoos.\n\nThe skin art consists of three arrows to represent their daughters\u2019 condition \u2013 most people are born with two copies of chromosome 21 but those with DS are born with three.\n\nIt baffles Rachael that pregnant women often elect to have an abortion rather than face a future raising a child with DS. \u201cThere are stigmas and this is why we share our story,\u201d she says. \u201cSociety needs to turn from eradicating people with DS.\n\nWe need to make a shift to teaching DS children that they can have the same love and desire to live life to the fullest as any-one else.\u201d In 2017 Cody was due to undergo a vasectomy but he and Rachael decided to put the procedure on hold.\n\nThey were keen to try for another baby, hoping they\u2019d be able to give their sons, Easton (now 5) and Hudson (now 3), a sister. Fifteen weeks into the pregnancy they discovered there were twins on the way.\n\nDoctors later warned there was a 50% risk their babies would be born with DS because one of the babies showed signs of a heart defect that\u2019s linked to the genetic condition. But Rachael and Cody decided not to do invasive tests to find out if the twins had DS.\n\n\u201cWe did however find out their gender,\u201d Rachael says \u201cWe were just far too excited not to find out. And they were over the moon when they were told they\u2019d soon be parents to two baby girls. After Lottie and Nettie were born at 35 weeks a nurse confirmed the babies had DS.\n\n\u201cMy response was, \u2018Really? Yay!\u2019 \u201d Rachael says. \u201cI actually hadn\u2019t remembered my own response, but she later visited to tell me that I\u2019d said this and that it was a relief to her to see our happiness because it wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d been expecting.\u201d\n\nThe couple were far more concerned that both children had been diagnosed with heart problems and needed to be whisked away to the ICU.\n\nNettie had an atrial septal defect (ASD), a small hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of the heart. Thankfully this healed on its own after birth. But her sister\u2019s heart condition was far more serious.\n\nLottie had atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), which is often associated with DS and affects blood flow. This meant she\u2019d need two heart operations to seal an opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart.\n\nThe twins were in hospital for 47 days before doctors gave them the green light to go home. But Lottie had to return when she was four months old to undergo the procedure to fix the leak in her heart. For the Prescotts it felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. They\u2019d gone through a similar thing with Hudson when he was two and needed surgery to fix a heart-valve defect.\n\n\u201cOur experience with him was stressful. However it turned out to be very useful as it prepared us somewhat for Lottie\u2019s surgery, which was a completely different monster,\u201d Rachael says.\n\nAfter having the surgery Lottie encountered many problems, including bacterial and viral illnesses, organ dam-age, a collapsed lung and pulmonary hypertension. For 35 days her parents kept vigil at her hospital bed, but Lottie is a little fighter and managed to pull through.\n\n\u201cWe were elated to take our baby home,\u201d Rachael says.Now just more than a year later the girls are just as active as other tots, crawling around, exploring and making messes. Having gone through everything that she has, Rachael has this advice for other parents who have children with DS.\n\n\u201cCling to hope through any medical hurdles and to joy always,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cCelebrate your children. Never hesitate to proclaim their worth and show the rest of the world that DS isn\u2019t a defect \u2013 it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d", "description": "Down syndrome twins Lottie and Nettie were born into a home of love \u2013 and they\u2019re winning hearts around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9465/eb274fe50f054e72a08a1408b2d4b08f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
