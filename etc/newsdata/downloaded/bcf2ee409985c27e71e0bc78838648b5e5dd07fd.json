What happened next is up for debate.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nCharlie Culberson suffered \"multiple facial fractures,\" according to the Braves. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nDave Martinez wanted to make one thing clear: The immediate aftermath of Atlanta Braves pinch hitter Charlie Culberson getting hit in the face in the seventh inning Saturday afternoon \u201cwasn\u2019t the way it was portrayed to be\u201d by home plate umpire Tim Timmons.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I wanted to do was be a jackass,\u201d the Washington Nationals manager said Sunday, visibly frustrated.\n\nThe dispute from the 10-1 loss is primarily about who asked for a review and in what fashion after a 91-mph, two-seam fastball from Nationals reliever Fernando Rodney ran up and in and hit Culberson close to the right eye socket as the hitter squared to bunt.\n\nTimmons and first base umpire Bill Welke ultimately ruled Culberson offered at the pitch and that the Braves would have another pinch hitter at the plate with an 0-1 count instead of a pinch runner at first base. (Culberson later left the field on a medical cart with a bloody towel on the right side of his face, and the Braves announced Sunday morning that Culberson suffered \u201cmultiple facial fractures\u201d and would travel to Atlanta to meet with team doctors to determine the next steps.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always sympathetic to a guy hit in the eye,\u201d Timmons said of the call. \u201cBut the rules are the rules.\u201d\n\nScary moment: Charlie Culberson just got hit in the face with a pitch after squaring up to bunt. pic.twitter.com/jYRGY0PaU4 \u2014 FOX Sports: Braves (@FOXSportsBraves) September 14, 2019\n\nBut how the review got initiated is unclear. Timmons said that, while trainers attended to Culberson lying on the ground, he heard Martinez calling over to him, so he approached Martinez, who then asked him to check whether Culberson offered. Martinez said it didn\u2019t go down like that but that he didn\u2019t want to discuss the situation at length. The only other way this situation could have started was if Timmons asked Martinez if he\u2019d like to check whether Culberson offered.\n\nNo matter how the review came about, Martinez asked for it and still defended the decision Sunday. He cited the 1-1 tie \u2014 important for the Nationals as they sink into the muddy waters of the National League wild-card race \u2014 and his role responsibilities as the manager.\n\n\u201c[The Braves] understood. It's part of the game,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe're in a 1-1 game. I would think that everybody would understand [the situation]. It's unfortunate. It stunk.\u201d\n\nHere's the full pool report with HP ump Tim Timmons: pic.twitter.com/u42EbNIqs2 \u2014 Sam Fortier (@Sam4TR) September 15, 2019\n\nHe compared the situation to one the Nationals encountered in early April, when shortstop Trea Turner broke his right index finger in two places on a bunt attempt against the Philadelphia Phillies. Umpires ruled then that Turner offered at the pitch.\n\nMartinez called Braves Manager Brian Snitker on Sunday morning to apologize for the situation on behalf of himself, Rodney and the Nationals organization. Martinez said Rodney \u201creally wanted to make sure that Charlie got the message that he was really sorry and that he hopes he\u2019s okay.\u201d Rodney, still visibly upset as he spoke in front of his locker Sunday, said had not personally reached out to Culberson yet but might later in the day.\n\n\u201cI want to say sorry,\u201d Rodney said. \u201cI don\u2019t want that to happen to nobody. Sometimes ... a lot of things happen in this game.\u201d\n\nTimmons\u2019s ruling had infuriated Snitker the night before, and he\u2019d been ejected for arguing his team should have been awarded a hit-by-pitch. Snitker said Sunday that Culberson looked better than anticipated and \u201csounded good for what he\u2019d been through.\u201d The Braves manager disagreed with the umpires\u2019 ruling \u2014 he saw no offer from Culberson \u2014 but understood why Martinez asked for a review.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they don\u2019t like doing it,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cI guess over the course of a game, that\u2019s one of the things you do ask about. Hard as it might be, you\u2019re still within your right to do that.\u201d\n\nAfter the pitch hit Culberson, Rodney became the focal point of a bullpen implosion that led to a 10-1 Nationals loss. Rodney said Sunday that he emotionally did not want to continue pitching but professionally understood he had a job to do. The reliever had encountered a similar situation in August 2008, when a fastball ran up and in and hit Tampa Bay catcher Shawn Riggans in the chest. Riggans later told reporters he couldn\u2019t breathe, it was hard to move his arms and \u201cI felt like I was about to die.\u201d Rodney stayed in then, too. Martinez defended his decision to stick with Rodney.\n\nThe manager never went to the mound, never discussed the situation with his pitcher, but he said he \u201ckind of made little gestures to him back and forth\u201d which signaled to him Rodney wanted to stay in. The manager knows Rodney well from previously coaching him in Tampa Bay, and he said the pitcher understood the situation was tough, as it would be for anybody, but he needed to keep pitching when the game resumed.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry that that happen,\u201d Rodney said. He added he never wants to hit anyone but sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable. \u201cThat\u2019s baseball. You have to continue and keep working, and you know that happened, but try to recover your mind and keep going and doing your thing.\u201d\n\nSaturday night was not the first time the Nationals had tension with Timmons this series. The crew chief ejected Nationals first base coach Tim Bogar on Friday night in the eighth inning for arguing about a check-swing call on Howie Kendrick.\n\nThe situation consumed Sunday, but baseball continued, as it does. Culberson flew back to Atlanta to meet with trainers. Timmons moved to umpire third base. Rodney told his manager he was available to pitch.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Austin Voth\u2019s possible resurgence impacts the Nationals\n\nBoswell: The Nats\u2019 bullpen will be better in October \u2014 if they make it that far\n\nNationals\u2019 Kurt Suzuki slowly making his way back, as Raudy Read gets a shot behind the plate\n\nBoswell: As the Nationals enter the MLB wild-card stretch run, the stakes are higher than imagined", "description": "Everything we know about the pitch that hit Culberson in the face, and the disputed review that followed.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xJ4vewB0xw90xQS7cZaXqFOcyLk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DVGK3LGX3UI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
