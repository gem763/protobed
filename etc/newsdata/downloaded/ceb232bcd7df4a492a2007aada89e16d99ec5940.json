His start comes as the Steelers try to keep their season from unraveling any further. The loss of Roethlisberger, who underwent surgery for a season-ending elbow injury, was too much for them to overcome after they said their offseason farewells to running back Le\u2019Veon Bell and wide receiver Antonio Brown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteelers at Chargers\n\nWhen: Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif.\n\nTV: NBC\n\nStreaming: fuboTV\n\nThere has been speculation that the Washington Redskins, after firing Jay Gruden as their coach, could make an offseason run at Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin. But regardless of whether Redskins owner Daniel Snyder is an admirer of Tomlin, the Steelers\u2019 history under the ownership of the Rooney family is that they simply do not get rid of coaches, and Tomlin has two seasons left on his contract after this season.\n\nThe Chargers enter the game with a record of 2-3. They had high hopes for this season after being one of the AFC\u2019s top teams last season and advancing to the divisional round of the playoffs. But they have been inconsistent after enduring a few key injuries and allowing the holdout of running back Melvin Gordon to extend into the regular season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Gordon is back and the Chargers have time to regroup. They\u2019re ranked 10th in the league in total defense and ninth in scoring defense but need more out of an offense, led by quarterback Philip Rivers, that is ranked 19th in the NFL in scoring.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges makes his first NFL start for Pittsburgh after the injuries to Ben Roethlisberger and Mason Rudolph.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/H9QVLQeWx3X9fScXNDxPKn5BrIk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NJKLXDHIP4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
