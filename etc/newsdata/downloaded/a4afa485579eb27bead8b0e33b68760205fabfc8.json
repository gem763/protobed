(Jim Spellman/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nWith football season comes a bombardment of television ads for \u201cmanly man\u201d foods \u2014 the triple-decker burgers, racks of ribs, Buffalo wings, mighty meaty pizzas galore. For those of us who are trying to eat healthier, seeing the artery-clogging junk fare during commercial breaks detracts from the game \u2014 and sometimes, even more regrettably, tempts the eyes.\n\nCall it a personal foul.\n\nAnyone still clinging to the \u201ceat like a man\u201d messaging would do well to see a new film, due out next week, called \u201cThe Game Changers.\u201d The documentary follows James Wilks, a mixed martial arts fighter and former combat trainer for the U.S. military, as he searches for an optimal diet to help him recover from a serious injury sustained while training.\n\n\u201cMany men have been led to believe that eating meat gives you a lot more energy and virility,\u201d Wilks told me. \u201cBut those things are actually inhibited by eating animal-based products.\u201d By the end of the film, Wilks is not just fully recovered, he\u2019s stronger and faster than ever. And he owes a big part of it to a plant-based diet.\n\nWilks said his interest in plant-based foods began after he read a study about the eating habits of Roman gladiators. The study concluded that the ancient fighters had trained and competed while eating mostly plants. They ate little or no meat, he said. That led Wilks to begin interviewing scores of nutritionists and medical experts, as well as modern-day athletes who had achieved success on similar diets that were free of animal products.\n\nAmong those featured in the film are Kendrick Farris, the U.S. record-holding weightlifter and the only American weightlifter to compete in the past three Olympic Games. There\u2019s ultramarathoner Scott Jurek, who has won the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run seven times back to back.\n\nAnd there\u2019s Bryant Jennings, a world heavyweight title contender from Philadelphia with a 24-4 record.\n\n\u201cGoing plant-based, your thinking process improves,\u201d Jennings told me during a recent visit to his home. \u201cYour body operates better because it\u2019s not under the influence of meat. When you eat the meat of an animal that was mistreated, stressed out and slaughtered, you mistreat your own body, and you become stressed out. That\u2019s because you are what you eat.\u201d\n\n[These athletes went vegan \u2014 and stayed strong]\n\nJennings, 35, looks young for his age. You\u2019d never know he was a boxer. Not a mark on his face. Eating plant-based foods helps him recover faster, heal quicker, he said. He stands about 6-foot-3, ripped. Weighs 225. \u201cSame size as I was in high school,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing plant-based had not resulted in loss of muscle or energy. He had gained speed and power.\n\nI had stopped eating animal products back in January. No problem so far. But football season could be tricky. I had memories of some good times watching games on a nice fall afternoon with friends who knew how to lay out a spread. Ribs, barbecue chicken, half smokes, hot dogs, cheeseburgers, cakes and pies. I not only caught myself wondering who might be playing this Thanksgiving, but who\u2019d be cooking what?\n\nSpending time with people like Jennings helped shore up my resolve. No man is an island when it comes to changing bad habits.\n\nHe\u2019d been plant-based since 2015. And he was sticking with the eating plan whether it was a holiday or a workout, a victory or a defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe film also features a segment on the dramatic improvement in the Tennessee Titans football team after several defensive players turned to a plant-based diet. (Those improvements appear to be continuing, judging from the Titans\u2019 43-13 season opener against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.)\n\nAlthough the film sets out to dispel the myths about meat and masculinity, two inspiring female athletes are also featured: Morgan Mitchell, a two-time Australian 400-meter sprinting champion who is set to represent the country in the 800-meter sprint at the Tokyo Olympics next year, and Dotsie Bausch, an eight-time U.S. national cycling champion who triumphed over eating disorders to become, at age 40, the oldest person in the history of her cycling event to win an Olympic medal.\n\nExecutive producers of the film include notable advocates of plant-based diets such as filmmaker James Cameron, tennis champion Novak Djokovic, Houston Rockets basketball star Chris Paul and, closer to home, Gwyn Whittaker, CEO of GreenFare Organic Cafe in Herndon, Va.\n\n\u201cThe film shatters the myth that people need animal protein for muscle and calcium for bone health, and [shows] that people actually thrive when they take those things out of their diets and replace them with a whole foods, plant-based diet,\u201d Whittaker told me. \u201cThat\u2019s the game-changer \u2014 the competitive advantage you get from knowing what you are supposed to eat instead of eating things that cause degradation of our performance.\u201d\n\nHopefully, the audience will be as diverse as those who joined to bring this important film to the screen, which is opening at 1,000 theaters on Sept 16.\n\nThere\u2019s much to be learned from the experts and athletes featured.\n\nJennings is my favorite. Fried chicken used to be his favorite food. But once he made up his mind to go plant-based, he let it go. Now beets are a favorite food. \u201cGood for the blood circulation,\u201d he said. He holds them like he would an apple and takes big, juicy bites.\n\n\u201cPeople look at me and see the benefits,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cBut they still say, \u2018I can\u2019t give up the meat. YOLO.\u2019 \u201d Meaning, you only live once.\n\n\u201cThen somebody will have a heart attack. And if they survive, I\u2019ll get a call. \u2018Can you tell me about that plant-based diet again?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut you need not wait until it\u2019s time to call 911, fellows. Eat that kale, leave that pork alone.\n\nMan up. YOLO.\n\nTo read previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/milloy.\n\nRead more:\n\n[Local newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)]\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "A new film, \u2018The Game Changers,\u2019 is making the case that eating like a man means giving up meat and eating healthier.", "authors": ["Courtland Milloy", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/784FbRsC9MvNFekJeU5-P_NlygE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QFDZ25WUAQI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
