Nine wooden cabinets containing hand-coloured framed photographs, used artificial limbs, tools, found objects, billboard paintings. India Pavilion, Our Time for a Future Caring, 58th International Art Exhibition \u2013 La Biennale di Venezia. (Collection of Shumita and Arani Bose, New York. )\n\nThe India Pavilion shows a sizzling art scene.\n\nThe India Pavilion at the Venice Biennale is only the country\u2019s second since India\u2019s independence in 1947. It\u2019s entrancing and educational as well as historic. It\u2019s a big show at the Arsenale, once Venice\u2019s military shipyard, and it was, in my opinion, the most impressive in the world\u2019s oldest and most prestigious art fair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt marks India\u2019s coming-of-age as an international art powerhouse. This has taken a long time and is happening in fits and starts, but that\u2019s fine. The art of India is a huge topic, and it\u2019s a lumbering country. The exhibition is a smart distillation of art from this vibrant, massively complex country, the world\u2019s biggest democracy. There are only eight artists in the show.\n\nOur Time for a Future Caring \u2014 I hate the title \u2014 introduces Indian art in the context of the 150th birthday of the philosopher and politician Mahatma Gandhi (1869\u20131948). Hitching this very punctuated survey to Gandhi\u2019s star is a good idea. The show eloquently observes that \u201cthe vast art landscape of India, its modern and contemporary art history, is not linear.\u201d Agreed. The country offers countless vernacular voices, many religions, and layers of history. Gandhi is universally known, still, 70 years after his death, as a symbol of peaceful, determined resistance to powerful overlords, self-reliance, and simplicity.\n\nThe show focuses on art, weaving Gandhi and the past hundred years of India\u2019s history in and out of a story that\u2019s meaningful to eager, new students of Indian art like me. This is an accomplishment and took discipline. India has lots of artists. The exhibition isn\u2019t small. It functions as a traditional museum show, with distinct spaces, multiple artists, and a balance of linear narrative and room for visitors to explore what appeals to them. It\u2019s rich and rewarding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exhibition doesn\u2019t try to define Gandhi as a connoisseur. He wasn\u2019t. Art was a tool. For much of his life, he was a lawyer, an itinerant and eventually famous dissident, and India\u2019s founding father. He was image-conscious, though. With a big, bald head, spindly legs, big smile, in a white wraparound, he was as recognizable as his contemporaries Queen Victoria and Greta Garbo, but unique. He had a look.\n\nIn the 1930s, Gandhi engineered exhibitions of art at India National Congress annual sessions. The show has a couple of starting points, but mine took me to a gallery of art, a pavilion-within-a-pavilion, by Nandalal Bose (1882\u20131966) done for the 1938 Congress in Haripura.\n\nThe work is scenes of everyday village life, consistent with the INC\u2019s engagement and empowerment of India\u2019s immense rural population. They have the directness of 1930s Soviet propaganda art, which isn\u2019t an insult on my part. It\u2019s effective art for a political convention. The figures are symbols, easy to access. These INC art pavilions in the 1930s were 1960s-style \u201chappenings\u201d as well as art shows. Nandalal and his team tailor-built the spaces in a local style using hay, bamboo, and wicker, creating the excitement as well as the civic dynamics of a barn raising. They were building a new country.\n\nThe art throughout the exhibition is good. My experience, training, and instinct as an art historian go only so far since this isn\u2019t Western art. It\u2019s different, and everyone is free to explore and respond mostly on their own terms. That said, an artist such as Maqpool Fida Husain (1915\u20132011) was Mumbai-based \u2014 a city slicker \u2014 and exhibited in the 1954 open-submission show at the Biennale and many subsequent shows in Europe. He is what I would call a modernist.\n\nI loved his work. I\u2019d seen a show earlier in the day in Venice at the Ca\u2019 Pesaro museum on Arshile Gorky, and Husain is in the same universe, but his vocabulary is Indian: village life, Indian spinning wheels, women giving very abstract births, and earth colors. It\u2019s foreign and fresh the way Marc Chagall\u2019s best work of remembered life in Russia is.\n\nHusain\u2019s work in the show is from the 1950s. Gandhi was dead, but the work in the exhibition shows his impact on a new, national aesthetic. Atul Dodiya (b. 1958) creates cabinets filled with found objects, photographs, old tools, crutches, prosthetic body parts, and poems. He lives in Mumbai, a place he describes as \u201cgiving so much joy and so much pain\u201d for its sheer sensual excess. It\u2019s art that seeks order from chaos \u2014 objects are enclosed in glass cabinets \u2014 and the nine big cabinets of Broken Branches, from 2002, are meant to be seen in a sequence. He calls Gandhi \u201cthe first Conceptual artist,\u201d and this does make sense to me. His art isn\u2019t gestural. He\u2019s not a slasher or a splasher. He creates the art of asceticism and self-control, which can be very expressive, just different.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a national, anti-foreign aesthetic, as in Italy or Germany under Fascism, and it\u2019s not historicist. It\u2019s not religious, either, which might be a gap in the show. One of the serious fault lines in India is religious, but that\u2019s not for this show. My sense is that India\u2019s artists today are like American artists: omnivorous, intensely entrepreneurial, and aggressive, joyful appropriators of anything that makes sense. India has been not on one crossroads but limitless crossroads. I listened to an interview with Dodiya. He\u2019s an international figure, thinking about Chinese art, Mondrian, Josef Albers, and Joseph Cornell. He\u2019s the pivot in the show. He\u2019s international and, thus, ambiguous.\n\nI was curious about one thing when I thought about the show, walking the endless path through the Arsenale. That\u2019s Gandhi and Hitler. Jitish Kallat (b. 1974), the youngest artist in the show, did a video projecting one of two letters Gandhi wrote to Hitler \u2014 a 1939 letter, and he wrote a second, longer one in 1940 \u2014 and I\u2019m sure what I think about the video. It\u2019s not art but a video transcription, and it draws the curtain showing Gandhi the politician. He lived in the real world, as do artists. In the letter, he was writing for history and, by the way, directly told Hitler that he was a bum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGR Iranna (b. 1970) assembled dozens of wooden slippers. It\u2019s a mass of footwear arranged evenly in rows, so there\u2019s a collective. Each shoe is different. Arranged together, it\u2019s a chorus of arches, going forward. Naavu (We Together), from 2019, is a tribute to \u201cwalking and marching as collective action, overcoming all differences in caste, color, and creed to be together and united.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sculpture, with each shoe different, all made from wood, no leather, and aesthetically engrossing. I thought of the piles of shoes found by the Allies at concentration camps in Germany and Poland after the Second World War, or the skulls of Pol Pot\u2019s casualties in Cambodia. Not the artist\u2019s goal, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\nEach viewer brings his or her own point of view to the show, and it\u2019s to the curator\u2019s credit that she makes this possible. My point of view privileges the individual. The show left me hungry to learn more about how this maze of a country, utterly different from what I consider home, privileges the individual, too. There\u2019s the wood and terra-cotta sculpture of Rummana Hussain (1952\u20131999), which draws on Muslim poetry. It\u2019s word and hands moving together. There\u2019s the funky feminist Of Bodies, Armour, and Cages, by Shakuntala Kulkarni (b. 1958), my favorite for its balanced, weird, elegant magnificence.\n\nAshim Purkayastha (b. 1967) takes us back to Bose and the India National Congress shows celebrating rural life. Bose did it in a direct, sincere poster style. Purkayastha is a rascal. He takes government stamps extolling Potemkin Village\u2013like rural life and gives them the perverse, sardonic look of experience and reality. He\u2019s a brilliant miniaturist. Defacing stamps is the most delicate, subtle bit of bomb-throwing.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a predictable show. Roobina Karode, the director of the Kiran Nadar Museum in New Delhi, curated the show. She leads India\u2019s first private, philanthropically funded museum. Forbes magazine called its founder, Kiran Nadar, a \u201chero of philanthropy\u201d when this contemporary art museum opened in 2010, and I think they\u2019re right. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about Alice Walton\u2019s courage, passion, vision, determination, and good taste in leading the Crystal Bridges Museum, and in Nadar, India she has her peer. India has millionaires and billionaires now but an undeveloped philanthropy sector. I think this is bound to change. The world doesn\u2019t move in a good way without people like Nadar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia, I\u2019m sure, has lots of clunky antiquities museums. Its commercial gallery scene is exploding and fantastic. Diplomatically, America and India are closer than ever. Still, there\u2019s little understanding of Indian art in America, though, and in that sense, India is about ten years behind Chinese art. When I was a museum director, American art museums were cautiously starting to lend to Chinese museums. Around the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, cultural collaboration was developing as Chinese museums upgraded their facilities, and Americans felt more confident about art exchanges with a country that is, after all, a police state.\n\nI think the India museum system is developing, on the one hand, in terms of reliability and facilities, but, on the other, like the country itself, the system is rambunctious, freewheeling, and far more decentralized. The last India Pavilion at the Biennale was in 2011, a sign that the art world there is still developing. For the entrepreneurial American museum, it\u2019s a great opportunity to be creative. The NEA, NEH, and the State Department\u2019s Culture and Education Department can certainly advance art collaborations, but that takes imagination and verve. Judging from the State Department\u2019s Martin Puryear show at the American Pavilion in Venice, I wonder whether either exists in discernible quantities. The show was a snooze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur Time for a Future Caring\u201d is a bad title. What does it mean? When it comes to caring, there\u2019s no time like the present. \u201cLet\u2019s promise to care . . . tomorrow\u201d is like the old saying \u201cLord, make me good, but not yet,\u201d which can also double as a toast before a bacchanalian debauch. \u201cOur Time for a Future Caring\u201d is a squishy title that makes the libertarian in me squirm. It sounds like the happy, clappy fundraising campaign. Next time, send the marketing consultants to Bhutan.\n\nI don\u2019t often have the honor to write about a historic art show. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing more and learning more about art in this big place.", "description": "\"Our Time for a Future Caring\" marks India's coming-of-age as an international art powerhouse.
