The stock has lost about 20% since a peak in April, equivalent to some $93 billion in market value.\n\nNaspers, which via its new digital company Prosus owns a 31% stake in Tencent, is also feeling the pain. Both shares fell by more than 5% yesterday, losing R145 billion of their combined market value in a single day.\n\nWhile the Tencent shares have been stuck in a downtrend for months, selling was particularly aggressive Wednesday despite no apparent trigger.\n\nREAD: SA Tourism signs two-year deal with Tencent to lure Chinese visitors\n\nTheories circulating round some trading floors included souring sentiment from investors in China, as well as concern that Tencent\u2019s decision to air National Basketball Association games may backfire.\n\nAdding to jitters this week was a local media report that China is considering revising a law to control young people\u2019s online gaming activities -- a business that remains one of Tencent\u2019s most profitable.\n\nThe Internet giant will report third quarter earnings on November 13.\n\nProsus, which is currently trading at around R1,020, has now lost almost 18% of its value since its listing in Amsterdam and on the JSE mid-September.", "description": "Naspers and Prosus fell by more than 5% yesterday, losing R145 billion of their combined market value in a single day.", "authors": ["Jeanny Yu", "With Additional Reporting"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6748/23c0a5918c834aeea07635cadcac9d05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
