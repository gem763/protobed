Called \u201cShort-Term Borrowings Disclosure,\u201d the SEC\u2019s proposal said \u201ca critical component of a company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources is often its access to short-term borrowings for working capital and to fund its operation.\u201d\n\nEvents during the financial crisis, and now, show that these types of arrangements \u201ccan be impacted, sometimes severely and rapidly, by illiquidity in the markets as a whole,\u201d according to the SEC\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s action this week was its first overnight repo auction since 2008 and it came after short-term repo rates surged to their highest level in years. The overnight borrowing rate \u2014 one that bond dealers, hedge funds, and other market participants are charged behind the scenes to borrow funds for a short period, in return for highly liquid collateral such as U.S. Treasurys \u2014 jumped to a high around 9%. The Fed\u2019s action pushed it back to a desired 2%-2.25% range but the New York Federal Reserve said it would carry out a second overnight repo operation on Wednesday \u2014up to $75 billion in repos.\n\nSee also: Wall Street raises questions about Fed\u2019s late action on funding squeeze\n\nGregg Gelzinis, a research associate at the Center for American Progress, an independent nonpartisan policy institute, told MarketWatch, \u201cIt\u2019s malpractice that a decade after the financial crisis, regulators still don\u2019t collect the data necessary to fully understand and map the risks in the repo market. The SEC has failed to finalize a 2010 proposal that would provide much better public disclosure on companies\u2019 use of repo borrowing.\u201d\n\nRead: Reforms haven\u2019t eliminated risk of another Lehman-type failure\n\nIn a comment letter to the SEC at the time of the proposal, then Sen. Carl Levin wrote, \u201cInaccurate accounting treatment of repurchase agreements was not confined to Lehman Brothers.\u201d Levin noted that other investment banks, such as Bank of America BAC, +0.20% and Citigroup C, +0.88% had acknowledged during the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission hearings after the crisis that they also recorded repos as sales versus financing.\n\nAccounting rules permitted the repo transactions to be treated as sales. That allowed Lehman to report a lower asset balance \u2014 it reported the Treasurys and mortgage backed securities as sold not lent \u2014 since the cash it received in the borrowing was less than the value of the assets it had pledged.\n\nHowever, the cash it received was not recorded as a loan, and the obligation to repay the loan and repurchase the Treasury security was not recognized as an increase in its liabilities. Instead, the right to repurchase the collateral was recorded as a new asset, a derivative right to purchase securities in the future.\n\nOn Oct 31, 2011 MF Global, a global broker-dealer led by former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, collapsed. MF Global could not meet margin calls on European sovereign debt it used as collateral in repo transactions. MF Global had recorded profit upfront from investing in the sovereign bonds and then using them as collateral in so-called \u201crepo-to-maturity\u201d contracts, also recorded as sales of the assets, and also did not fully disclose its resulting repo loan liabilities.\n\nGelzinis says the recent spike in repo rates may have had a few idiosyncratic causes, and certainly doesn\u2019t signal the type of run seen in 2007-2008, \u201cbut regulators should take this week\u2019s turbulence as an opportunity to re-evaluate the fragility of this short-term funding market.\u201d\n\nIn tri-party repos, which Lehman and MF Global used, a clearing bank provides collateral valuation, margining, and services to ensure terms of the repo are met. The average daily cash value of reverse repo agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities for the week ended Sept 11, 2019, according to the Fed\u2019s \u201cFactors Affecting Reserve Balances\u201d report, H.4.1, was $291.974 billion. That\u2019s $9.727 billion less than the prior week but more than the same period last year.\n\nIn a bilateral repo, the lender drives the valuation and margin requirements on collateral pledged by the borrower. Gelzinis told MarketWatch, \u201cThe Office of Financial Research recently started collecting more repo data, but even this expanded data collection fails to capture the massive bilateral segment of the repo market. Bilateral repos, a huge segment of the market, are still in the shadows. They should collect more and better data on the market and also consider proposals to fundamentally restructure the market to address the ongoing systemic risk it poses to the financial system and broader economy.\u201d", "description": "The SEC never finalized a post-crisis rule that would give investors more info about companies\u2019 exposure to repos and impact spike in borrowing rates", "authors": ["Francine Mckenna"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ142_clayto_ZG_20181127131916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
