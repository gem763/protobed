I don\u2019t think there was any wrongdoing,\" Clapper said. \"My main concern was with the Russians and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric and ugh, the message I'm getting from all of this is apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us and oh by the way, blown off what the then commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all of the reporting we could.\"\n\n\"What Obama told us to do....\" pic.twitter.com/KEKHTx40j3 \u2014 Rep.

(@RepStevenSmith) October 8, 2019\n\nThis is quite a telling statement about President Obama's involvement in the surveillance of a political opponent, Donald Trump, who vowed to reverse his legacy if elected. There's also a pattern.\n\nOfficials at the Defense Department were also preserving information and accusing Trump campaign officials of \"dealing with Russians,\" before President Trump was officially sworn into office.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan, who pushed lies about Russia collusion for years, isn't a fan of Durham's investigation.\n\n\"I'm supposedly going to be interviewed by Mr. Durham as part of this non-investigation... I don't understand the predication of this worldwide effort to try to uncover dirt... that would discredit that investigation in 2016\" - @JohnBrennan w/ @NicolleDWallace pic.twitter.com/FqDbIW9P41 \u2014 Deadline White House (@DeadlineWH) October 2, 2019\n\nMeanwhile Obama, who has along history of using the government to target political enemies, denies ever ordering the surveillance of any U.S. citizen.", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:14:16PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/236/a5ef618f-e0da-4d44-8abe-22d136f9fbb4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
