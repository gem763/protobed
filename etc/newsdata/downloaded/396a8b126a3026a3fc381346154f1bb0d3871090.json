Jesus Christ won\u2019t save you and even if they arrest me, there will be people coming after you.'\n\nEarlier this year, despite Lauretta's imprisonment, a letter was sent to Borrometti's office with nails in it - suggestive of 'nails in the coffin'.\n\nThey came with a letter with with Sicilian words 'Picca nai', meaning 'You have little time left'.\n\nBorrometti currently lives under police protection.\n\nAccording to a Ragusan official, Salvo La Rosa, Carbonaro took the punishment of his previous crimes, repented, but then returned to create a new 'legitimate' looking organisation with nefarious activities hidden behind the scenes.\n\nClaudio Carbonaro, a notorious mafioso, has been arrested along with 14 others for his part as the head of a major toxic plastic recycling scam\n\nThe crackdown followed a four-year probe after the seizure in Rome of shoes made of toxic materials.\n\nThe investigation revealed plastic waste was being collected in warehouses in Sicily and shipped to China, only to return to Italy as footwear.\n\nThursday's arrests were made in and around the Sicilian city of Ragusa.", "description": "Italy has arrested a mafia crime boss - thought responsible for over 60 murders - in a plastic-recycling ring which sent toxic materials to China to make shoes that were then sold in Italy.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/17/20188726-0-image-a-108_1572020530946.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
