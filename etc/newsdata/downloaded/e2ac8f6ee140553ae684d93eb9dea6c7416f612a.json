Each training I\u2019m suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard \u2013 to push literally all my fear and everything away.\u2019\n\nShark ripped off woman's breast and both her hands as she swam with dolphins\n\nVervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. Like training hard, she said it gave her control and put \u2018my own life in my hands.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really scared, but those (euthanasia) papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it\u2019s enough for me, I have those papers,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018If I didn\u2019t have those papers, I think I\u2019d have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. \u2026 I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.\u2019\n\nVervoort also had epileptic seizures and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs. That resulted in a four-month hospital stay.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nShe talked of sleeping only 10 minutes some nights, described severe pain that caused others to pass out just watching her (Picture: AP)\n\nRio, Vervoort described living with unbroken pain from an incurable, degenerative spinal disease\n\nA loyal Labrador named Zenn began staying with her, pawing her when a seizure was about to occur. Zenn also pulled her socks out of the sock drawer, she said, and helped carry groceries home when Vervoort bought too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018When I\u2019m going to have an epileptic attack, she warns me one hour before. I don\u2019t know how she feels it.\u2019\n\nVervoort said she kept pushing back the day of her death, knowing it could come anytime \u2013 as it can for anyone. She said she can be pain-free one minute, and nearly pass out a few minutes later.\n\nShe said: \u2018You have to live day-by-day and enjoy the little moments. Everybody tomorrow can have a car accident and die, or a heart attack and die. It can be tomorrow for everybody.\u2019\n\nVervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia\n\nLike training hard, she said it gave her control and put \u2018my own life in my hands\u2019\n\nVervoort called herself a \u2018crazy lady.\u2019\n\nShe talked of flying in an F-16 fighter jet, riding in a rally car, and she was curating a museum of her life going back to at least 14 when she was diagnosed with her rare illness.\n\nShe had spikey hair and wanted to be remembered as the lady who was \u2018always laughing, always smiling.\u2019\n\nShe said: \u2018I feel different about death now than years ago. For me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up. For me it\u2019s something peaceful.\u2019\n\nPictured in the Women\u2019s 100m T52 Final on day 7 of the London 2012 Paralympic Games (Picture: Getty)\n\nVervoort also had epileptic seizures and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
