There are a lot of people who aren\u2019t going to make it off this island.\u201d\n\nAnthony Thompson, 27, who works in a funeral home, said: \u201cI know what death smells like. There must be hundreds. Hundreds.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Bahamas\u2019 only remaining public hospital said the death toll would be \u201cstaggering\u201d, and that two large refrigerated trucks would be needed to hold the bodies that were expected to be found.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve ordered lots of body bags,\u201d said Caroline Burnett-Garraway, medical chief of staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau. She said that dealing with all of the dead would take weeks.\n\nReports said relief groups have been prioritising the need to move doctors, nurses and medical supplies into the hardest-hit areas, and help survivors get food and safe drinking water. The risk of outbreaks of diarrhoea and waterborne diseases because of possible contamination by sewage.\n\nThe United Nations estimated 70,000 people were in immediate need of food, water and shelter on the islands.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

When the storm made landfall on Friday in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, its winds were still 90 mph, though that was half the force with which Dorian sat over the Bahamas for more than 36 hours.\n\nSheriff\u2019s officials sent medics and other rescuers to Ocracoke Island, accessible only by boat or air, to reach those who made the mistake of defying mandatory evacuation orders along the 200-mile strip of islands.\n\n\u201cThere is significant concern about hundreds of people trapped on Ocracoke Island,\u201d said North Carolina governor Roy Cooper. \u201cThere are rescue teams ready as soon as they can get in.\u201d\n\nResidents repeatedly said they never seen such flooding.\n\n\u201cThe wall of water just came rushing through the island from the sound side. And it just started looking like a bathtub, very quickly,\u201d said Steve Harris, who has lived on Ocracoke Island for 19 years. \u201cWe went from almost no water to 4 to 6ft in a matter of minutes.\u201d\n\nMore than 350,000 people were without electricity in the Carolinas and Virginia as Dorian moved up the coast.\n\nAt least four people were killed in the southeast. All were men in Florida or North Carolina who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane.\n\nMore than a quarter-million residents and visitors had been ordered to evacuate the North Carolina island chain ahead of the storm, officials said.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Officials in the Bahamas have warned the death toll from Hurricane Dorian could become \u201cstaggering\u201d, as the now weakened storm rocked residents of North Carolina, some of whom had to be rescued from their attics.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/16/dorian-staggering2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
