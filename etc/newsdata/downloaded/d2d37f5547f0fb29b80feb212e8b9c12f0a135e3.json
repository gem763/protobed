And while there was to be no fairy-tale ending, with Diva Spirit having to make do with an honourable fourth, the jockey appeared completely at ease with the decision.\n\nTinkler told Sky Sports Racing: \u201cIt\u2019s a decision we all have to make at some point. I\u2019m very fortunate that I\u2019ve got a thriving business in Warwickshire \u2013 producing point-to-pointers and young horses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to go, but it\u2019s a good time to go \u2013 I\u2019m very positive about it really. My family are here. I\u2019ve had a great time and thank you to everyone.\u201d\n\nTinkler is best known for his long-term association with Nicky Henderson, for whom he rode several big-race winners.", "description": "Andrew Tinkler announced his immediate retirement from the saddle after riding in the concluding race at Fontwell on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Charlie Brooks", "Marcus Armytage"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213909897-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqqe94gVf5fwATDoCZ63F3bFNnSTnP2MdInW5qSl1TD3U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
