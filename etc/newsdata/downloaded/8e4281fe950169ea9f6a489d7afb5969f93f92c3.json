But either way, their interests align. Here\u2019s Trump this afternoon\u2026\n\n\u2026.taken out of Ukraine and China. Additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2019\n\n\u2026and here\u2019s the Post reporting on the mood among Senate Republicans today, with some reportedly \u201cstunned\u201d by the transcript of the call between Trump and Zelensky (it was a \u201chuge mistake\u201d to release it, said one) and others eager to steer the conversation towards the Bidens. None is more eager than Ron Johnson, reportedly.\n\nOne early divide among Senate Republicans is between the \u201cBurr camp\u201d and the \u201cJohnson camp,\u201d according to two senior GOP aides who were not authorized to speak publicly, referring to Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Burr\u2019s faction of the Senate GOP has a darker, frustrated view of Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine, while Johnson\u2019s wing is more focused on probing Biden, the aides said\u2026 Johnson, meanwhile, told colleagues he would consider investigating Biden and Ukraine and said he took those issues seriously \u2014 a position that was strongly encouraged by several allies of Trump at the lunch, according to three people familiar with the conversations. When asked for comment late Tuesday about those discussions, Johnson said in a statement, \u201cWe have and will continue to gather information and conduct oversight on alleged misconduct within government agencies.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said, \u201cBiden is the one who threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid, not Trump, and that has to be investigated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer. Investigating Biden would be \u201con brand\u201d for the Trump-era GOP in that the president\u2019s instinct whenever he\u2019s accused of wrongdoing is to ask about the accuser\u2019s wrongdoing. He fights, so naturally he\u2019d want to go on offense while the Democrats momentarily have him on the defensive. Plus, Hunter Biden\u2019s hiring by Burisma really does seem dubious from the outside, a potential case of influence peddling by bringing in the vice president\u2019s son. And Joe Biden serving as the Obama White House\u2019s enforcer against the Ukrainian prosecutor despite the prosecutor\u2019s prior interest in Burisma reeks of a conflict of interest and has the appearance of impropriety. It\u2019s not wrong to wonder if there\u2019s evidence that Joe tried to protect Hunter.\n\nBut the catch for Johnson in investigating this is that the prosecutor in question really was corrupt according to all available reporting on the subject. And he wasn\u2019t pursuing Burisma when Biden started twisting Ukrainian arms to drop the axe on him. Which means the likely result of the probe is \u2026 vindication for the Bidens?\n\nRegarding Biden getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired: Joe Biden was doing the bidding of Barack Obama, the then President of the United States. Had Joe Biden not been the one entrusted with the role, someone else would have done it. The exact same threat would have been made. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) September 25, 2019\n\nTo suggest Biden had the prosecutor fired to protect Hunter Biden is nonsense. The prosecutor was going to get fired via American pressure. Biden just happened to be the guy Obama chose to do it. \u2014 Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) September 25, 2019\n\nFrom the GOP\u2019s perspective, it probably doesn\u2019t matter how Johnson\u2019s investigation turns out. The point is to *have* an investigation, to crowd out some of the headlines about Trump and Ukraine and do political damage to Biden by raising suspicions about him. It\u2019s a shrewd plan \u2014 unless, of course, it ends up ultimately benefiting progressives most of all by helping to keep the Ukraine matter in the news day after day and softening up Biden\u2019s Democratic support to the point where he\u2019s easy pickings for Elizabeth Warren in the primaries.\n\nSpeaking of congressional probes of Ukraine diplomacy, Pelosi reportedly wants any impeachment of Trump to focus on his approach to Zelensky about Biden rather than a kitchen-sink indictment in which Democrats bring in Russiagate obstruction, emoluments, and so on:\n\nInside the room, Democrats said, Pelosi (Calif.) told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on the Ukraine allegations could help keep the investigation out of the courts, where a slew of investigative matters have been bogged down for months \u2014 though she did not rule out ultimately including other episodes in a potential impeachment package. The meeting included multiple members of the House Judiciary Committee, which has been probing alleged obstruction of justice, self-dealing and other matters involving Trump, though not Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). It ended without a firm decision on whether to circumscribe the probe but with consensus inside the room that narrowing the investigation, if only in terms of political messaging, made sense.\n\nI think that\u2019s the smart way to go, not just because it keeps Democrats out of court but because the allegation in the Ukraine matter is easy for the average voter to grasp. If Dems weren\u2019t able to get the public excited for impeachment over Russiagate in two years of trying, they\u2019re not going to belatedly spark enthusiasm to revisit the obstruction claims from that case now. And emoluments have never been on the public\u2019s radar; that\u2019s something Pelosi could place on the back burner and possibly revisit later if there\u2019s an unusually stark case of Trump being paid by a foreign government. Emoluments would be another heavy lift in terms of public opinion, though, since Americans assume all politicians are corrupt. At worst, they\u2019ll conclude, Trump is just a bit more obvious about it. Ukraine is Pelosi\u2019s best bet to make the public kinda sorta \u201ccomfortable\u201d with impeachment, in the full expectation that the effort will fail dismally in the Senate.", "description": "Collusion?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jb-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
