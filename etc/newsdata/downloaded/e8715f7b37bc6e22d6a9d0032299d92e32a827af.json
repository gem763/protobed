He wrote that song \u201cClarity\u201d that seems to always be playing in every dentist office and elevator on a loop? He dated Selena Gomez for a hot minute? Well, Zedd is back, and for the strangest reason possible. He is apparently stuck in the middle of a geopolitical controversy for liking a tweet from the official South Park account on Twitter. South Park drew ire from China over a recent episode, \u201cBand in China,\u201d which centered around and mocked the country\u2019s stringent censorship laws. The tweet that Zedd liked celebrated the show\u2019s 300th episode. Zedd tweeted his confusion over the ban on Friday, and CNBC confirmed the veracity of the ban with his management. Meanwhile, Zedd\u2019s music is still available on Chinese streaming services. This has been your daily helping of political word soup. You\u2019re welcome!", "description": "Zedd is banned from China after he liked a tweet about South Park.
