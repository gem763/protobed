She was surrounded by maggots and excrement.\n\nDa Cruz, originally from Portugal, also has three other children, and her lawyers said she never accepted her fourth pregnancy.\n\nLast November, after a week-long jury trial, a court sentenced Da Cruz to a five-year jail term, but three years were suspended.\n\nShe appealed the sentence, but so did prosecutors who sought a sentence of no less than 10 years.\n\nOn Wednesday, appeals judges in Limoges said Da Cruz should serve five years in prison and withdrew all parental authority over her daughter, now in foster care.\n\nThe girl suffers severe mental impairments, including irreversible autism, which medical experts attribute to sensory deprivation during her early months.\n\nDa Cruz's partner Domingos Sampaio Alves, an unemployed bricklayer, insisted during a previous court appearance that he had no idea Da Cruz had given birth to another child.\n\n\"I don't know why she did this,\" he told the court, describing her as \"a good mother\" to their other children, then aged nine, 14 and 15.\n\nThe couple were allowed to keep their three older children, whom a paediatrician described in court as having been \"perfectly raised\".\n\nDuring the trial, it emerged that Da Cruz had also initially hidden the pregnancies of two of her other children from her partner, not wanting to accept reality.\n\nHer lawyers had argued for Da Cruz's acquittal, saying she was mentally unwell.", "description": "A French appeals court on Wednesday sentenced a woman to five years in prison for having kept her baby daughter hidden for nearly two years, mainly in the maggot-infested boot of her car.
